 away and it is no good. Well, this was not a first round knockout. This was not a referee stops contest, which we thought it might be. 14 all at the half, Mercedes-Benz Halftime Show coming up. Even though Philadelphia's run 35 plays and the Texans have run 25, a lot of that has to do with the up-tempo for Philadelphia. I think Lovie Smith at the half really getting his team to believe, okay, that's a good 30 minutes, but guys, we've been competing most games. We've got to finish against the best team in the league as far as record's concerned. Britton Covey, he gets taken down. Good special teams coverage, 16-yard line, tackle there. Here's Kaylee. Well, Al, during the half, Nick Sirianni told the Eagles, embrace the dogfight that we're in. He said, we will be stronger because of it. I asked him if they have got an answer for Damian Pierce after he ran for 88 yards through two quarters on him. He said, yeah, we've got to wrap it up. He knew that their run defense would be challenged tonight by Pierce. He said, we have got to see improved tackling in the second half. Kaylee, I think, embrace the dog fight. It's D-A-W-G. Yeah, that's right. Dog mentality. Right, the dog mentality is what he calls it. The very energetic second-year head coach of the Eagles. from the 17-yard line. Look out from behind, and they start with a sack on the first play. Coming in around the corner, Jerry Hughes with some help from his friends. Jerry Hughes continues to just impress. Mulatto, that left tackle, gets, look at the bend that he uses. The bend to get underneath and then to be able to close and finish. What a great way to start the second half for the Texans. And Jerry Hughes, keep in mind, 34 years old in his 13th year, playing like he's in his second or third with his quickness. Long time Buffalo Bills, second down and 16. Sanders, good blocking, nice run. Owens making the tackle there. So from second and long to go to third and short. Third and three. And look who's out front again. Our guy Jason Kelsey. I told you how he loves to pull. And he doesn't just love to do it. He's really effective. He turns to the inside looking for a scraping backer. And eventually gets Kirksey. Throws a shoulder. But he wants more. And that's what you love about him. He'll do just enough little chip. And then lead the way. And now they've got a real shot here on third and short. Gainwell moving. Look out again. And there is Hughes again. And they stopped the play there in the grass. So two sacks on the first three plays, and it's fourth down. There he is again, and it's just becoming a mismatch on the left side with Malata. Using that quickness, again, the bend to be able to get low. And then look at the swipe. Jalen Hurts, good awareness to be able to protect the ball because 55 was coming through to try to knock that ball loose and get a turnover. But right now he's dominating left side of that offense line. Aaron Sippus, former Aussie rugby player, sends it down to the 38-yard line, making the grab there and stopped in his tracks is Desmond King. Jerry Hughes' 13th season, meaning he's been sacking guys since way back when. Freeman, Ponder, Mark Sanchez, Hasselbeck, and Gabbard. His first five quarterback sacks. Hurts, Willis last week, Fields, Ryan, and Zach Wilson. And again, look how agile he is. You know, he takes care of his body, works hard, such a pro, and it's great to see it pay off for a guy like that. Yeah, he's seen them all. Mills, flag thrown, and... incomplete and we'll see about the penalty. Yeah, I think they got a hold on Brevin Jordan, the tight end, trying to protect the edge. Holding. Offense, number nine. The 10-yard penalty. First down. They put three tight ends off to the right there and tied into your far right. Jordan. Son Reddick just trying to work outside. He just grabs onto that jersey. a couple times. You know, play like that by Redick. Maybe you forget about it tomorrow, but it's not always about the sacks. Sometimes it's about just being able to get upfield like that. And they're able to get Philly out of position and get their couple linemen, Green and Quezenberry, out front there. You had four runs, one pass now. Second and two, Pierce is the running back. Give it to him. And he will move the sticks. To the 13 he goes, and Pierce already tonight in the first half, 88 yards on the ground. There's nobody that watched last week's game against Tennessee that would be able to come into tonight and say that this offensive line would get this kind of push against the Philadelphia defense, even without the big rookie Jordan Davis out. That is incredible to think, and it just goes to show you from one week to the next how different matchups can be and how different flows of games can be. Butcher Cox is back in the game. Low snap. Mills is there. Mills scrambling. Eyes downfield. Throws! And it is caught for the touchdown by Chris Moore. 75 yards and seven plays. He's right over here, and he's just going to work the back edge of the end zone. But this is what you love to see from Mills. Athletic ability and then an absolute laser. And I wondered if he completed the process of the catch there. He made the catch initially. It's an incomplete pass. Incomplete. Wow. On the field, they call it incomplete. Now, no challenges in the last couple of minutes. So, look at it. And the elbow. Well, you know, you look at that knee down, elbow down. Terry, what are you seeing? Al, he goes to the ground to complete the catch, and he maintains control when it hits the ground and thereafter. This is a catch and should be reversed to a touchdown. Right, so they called it incomplete on the field. Ball comes out late. it does come out but it comes out late like Terry is saying it seems like the play is over at this point and then the ball comes out the side judge is calling it a touchdown he signaled touchdown they're looking up at the board and they know that there's the likelihood this thing is going to be reversed Greg Rolstead going over the video just an incredible play by Davis Mills breaking contained, showing you the athletic ability, and then just the arm strength on the run and being decisive to give him a chance to get that completion. Well, that should make it 14-13 with Fairbairn coming in to try to tie the game. And a huge drive in the sense that if they don't score and give it back to Philadelphia, We had the chance for the two for one, end of the first half, beginning of the second half. Here it is again for another look. Again, the throw. And how about these receivers? Remember, Nico Collins is out. Brandon Cooks isn't playing. You've got guys that are usually on special teams stepping up, and Chris Moore showing what he's capable of doing when you give him a chance out at receiver. taken longer than we thought. Yeah, I mean, this is fairly clear, unless we both go to the ophthalmologist tonight. After a view, the runners did survive the ground and did not lose the ball until he started getting out. Therefore, it was a touchdown. There you go. Big play. Big drive. Unbelievable. I think initially they thought about maybe just working the clock and not getting the ball back to Philly. And then Damian Pierce pops a couple runs. They get into plus territory. And then Pep Hamilton dials it up, gets more aggressive. And his quarterback, Davis Mills, makes an incredible play there, breaking contain, and a great throw to Chris Moore. God willing we should all survive the ground Here comes the extra point Fair Baron Boots it through with 37 seconds remaining And we return to NRG Stadium In 30 seconds Well the 7th play of this drive Was this again Moore Ruled the touchdown by one official Incomplete by another looked at it again clearly in game time this Houston team just playing like they don't care just playing like they don't have anything to win the safety for a big play in the touchdown turn over leads to 7 Elliott converts start with the pick here under pressure Mills throws, ill-advised, and the next thing you know, it's 21. And the Texans now will try to answer. And he has made for this team as all of the newcomers have played significant roles. From the 25, look out, gets it away, but Moore is going to get taken down. for a loss of four by Edwards, number 57. Redick came in and forced the issue. It'll be second down. Redick gets in there. You were just mentioning with that graphic some of these players they picked up. Howie Roseman, the general manager right now, has got to be considered the top executive of the year with some of these moves that he has been able to make. Not just the players and the impact they've had, but deliberately finding character and guys that fit the system of Nick Ceriani, Team guys. Guys that want to be a part of something special. Not just checking a box for a talented player. That's, to me, a big difference in what they've done here in Philly. And Roseman's had an interesting past few years. The screen's set up there. And then it's Chris Moore. Who almost gets stopped before he gets started and turns it into a long game. Out to close to midfield. Once he got away from Avante Maddox, he had linemen downfield. Watch the chance, the risk that you take right there to try to make the tackle. Now you've got Laramie Tunsil. You've got other linemen downfield. And I'll tell you what, man. Chris Moore is having a night. Top two receivers, Nico Collins and Brandon Cooks not playing. And Chris Moore, more of a special teams guy, is stepping up. There he is, four catches for 43. Pierce stopping and starting. To the 48, he goes second and long. This is a team that admittedly would tell you, hey, listen, our receivers are down. We're going to go to a lot of two and three tight end sets, which is what Pat Hamilton would do normally anyway. But there's Nico Collins, who has a groin, is not playing tonight. But he knew at some point he'd have to rely on Dorsett or Chris Moore or others to try to make some plays. You can't just run every time or throw short to these tight ends. On second and seven, Pierce. Look at the way this guy runs to the 41-yard line. He goes, and Pierce is now over 100. That's 103 rushing yards for the rookie. A great double team on the inside, but watch the left tackle, Tunsell, with the leg drive. What a matchup and a tough running. I mean, he's running it. You get in his way, he's going to run over his own linemen. He's going to run over defensive linemen, safeties. He gets his pads down, and he is physical. Runs with passion, man. Texans tonight, 20 runs, 15 throws. Pierce again, exploits that hole to the 35. Downstairs to Kaylee. Al, I asked Pierce if there's any strength training he does to prepare his body to break tackles like that, And he said with a smile, you don't teach an ox how to pull a wagon. You know, since his day is playing football in his backyard without pads on as a kid, he told me he felt he'd rather dictate a hit than let anyone hit him. Now eight weeks into his rookie season, he says, that mentality has only been reinforced. That's something Keith Jackson would assume. It'll turn the ox to pull a wagon. Second down and six. Here he is again. and a spin will likely net the first down. See where they spot it. Bradbury makes the tackle. Four and a half to go in the quarter. Watch this little stutter step right when he gets the ball. He senses penetration and just dances around Brandon Graham and a tackle O.J. or the tight end O.J. Howard. Now that's running with vision. If he just ran to where the hole's supposed to be, that's about a two-yard loss. Instead, just the instincts. He's not just a bull in a china shop running around back there. He's got great feel and instincts for this offense and the style that they use. From the 31. Quitoriano, the tight end there, sustaining his block. While he's having a great night, the line, the tight ends, and the fullbacks are doing their job. Second and one, give it to Birkhead. Lose, obviously they don't. Philly does with an undefeated record. and you've got a lot of young guys, a lot of guys like Chris Moore who's in his seventh year but haven't played a ton, are out to show that they can make plays and want to get more opportunities. Well, Hurts, a couple of long throws downfield. They've pulled the time out. They've got 37 seconds to maybe try to get them into field goal range. Meanwhile, Philadelphia coming into this game crazy in the second quarter. Killing team. They had 126 points. they were plus 96 in the second quarter but tonight just 7 they scored more points in the second quarter coming in tonight than Houston has scored in three other teams in the entire year right keep it on the ground here and working his way for a gain of 7 or so Kenneth Gainwell visual evidence here 133 points for most in any quarter through the first eight games in any quarter in the history of the National Football League. Would be the second best in any quarter through the first eight games, plus 96. So 7-7 in the second quarter. Right. A real win. Yeah, they have only 70 points combined in their other three quarters. Anyway, they stopped the clock here on the second and two at the 33. Well, anytime you have the big playability that they have with A.J. Brown and Devontae Smith, and you've got the timeouts, always capable getting into field goal range with 31 seconds. Brown tonight, two catches with 30. They have five different guys, each with two catches. Hertz to the outside the tackle is made inbounds there on Gainwell but they'll stop the clock with their second time out first down Sadwick and a so first down up at the 36 yard line Hertz and that's going to be caught and out of bounds goes Goddard and that stops the clock at 19. Nice job of a quick release by Goddard. Gave him a chance here again. You know Lovie Smith is going to play this Tampa 2 look with a safety deep here, corner here in the flat. So you've got to be able to find the hole between them. And the beauty of having Goddard is he has the skill set and the length to be able to get in there. And Hurts gets the ball out on time to give him a chance to get his feet down and pick up yards and get out of bounds. Pretty close to field goal range. Right now it would be a 61-yarder from here. Trying to pick up a few more. And Hurst will take off and he'll get a few more to the 35. Addison trips him up there. Clock ticking down. They still have their last timeout. And Elliott will come in with three seconds and that timeout taken here. Really smart play by Jalen Hurst. Again, Tampa 2 means this linebacker is going to bail. Watch how quickly he anticipates that Kirksey's going to get out of there, and he puts his foot in that last drop and then takes off and knows all. He's not trying to score or get a first down. He's just trying to get positive yards to give his kicker a chance here at a last-second field goal at the end of the half. This one will be from 54. Career-long 61. Game winner his time expired against the Giants in the second career NFL game back in 17. So we'll try to give the lead to Philadelphia. The timeout is taken here. by Houston. Again, just to use this last play by Jalen Hurts, how far he has come with situational awareness. You go from a 61-yard field goal attempt, and instead of forcing a throw or trying to make something downfield, he knows if he can get five or six, seven yards, just give Jake Elliott a chance, and he does. He picks up seven yards, and now you've got a legitimate shot here for three points. That's according to NextGenStats powered by AWS. The make probability, 37%. The miss probability, 63%. Here we go. Just covering all bases. Gets it down. Kick is on. They sure did. They sure did. There are a lot of Philly fans here. Probably excited to try to get a win tonight and see if the Phillies come down here in a couple nights. They'll come down for sure for game six, and those folks hopefully they can get some tickets. That's right. Jake Elliott to kick off. And week nine is underway. With the Texans starting at the 25-yard line. Davis Mills went to school at Stanford. Great high school quarterback in Georgia. His numbers on the season, ATD, six picks. The rating is about 10 points lower than the league average. Plays very well at home, even though his home record over the past two seasons is 1-8-1. And with those weapons down on the outside, of course they're still going to try to throw, but they're going to really have to control things up front. Starts from the gun, gives the ball to the rookie, Damian Pierce, at a Florida fourth-round pick. They loved him from the get-go in training camp. stop there after a gain of 11 on the first down. That's a great way to start. Trips to the field and just get a nice double team. Kick down there by the right tackle. Titus Howard opens up. And I'll tell you, if you have not seen Damian Pierce run, the rookie out of Florida, doesn't need a lot of room. Great quickness and runs with violence and being able to get through these arm tackles you'll see tonight. Breaks a ton of tackles. Here's Phillip Gorsett. And he takes it out to the 43-yard line. Slay and Epps making the stop there. Gain of seven, second down and three. Pep Hamilton, again, we talked about in the open, has a reputation as a play caller going back to even in college when he was at Stanford. He's with the Colts. He's been around. A lot of people look at him as a guy that wants to establish to run, even if he's healthy at receiver and even if he's talented and has a great deal of skill. So he wants to run the football, but, of course, doesn't want to be too predictable and will have some early down passes. Second down and short Give it to Pierce And Pierce is able to show you What he does Keeps those legs churning Broke 17 tackles in the game earlier this year Takes it to the 48 yard line We talked about this when we did a preseason game here How does a guy like this Last until the fourth round? Yeah, and when he was in college in Florida You see the fourth round He was just a guy that was a platoon back He's very healthy, has fresh legs He did not get worn down in his time in Gainesville. But I think he has a great deal of passion. He has a chip on his shoulder like a lot of guys that slide in the draft. He's out to prove everybody wrong. Put a fullback in Troy Hairston in front of him, and he helps lead the way. Starts to stumble, keeps his feet down, takes it into eagle territory to the 48. Fletcher Cox making the tackle there. Defensive coordinator is Jonathan Gannon. And he was one of three finalists for the Houston head coaching job in the offseason. Along with Josh McCown, the quarterback who has no coaching experience, and Lovie Smith. And this guy will probably get some more interviews at the end of this season. Yeah, like we said, this defense gets overlooked because Jalen Hurts and that offense gets most of the headlines. But they are off to a great start these first seven games. Quick flip out to Moore. And Moore along the sidelines, of course, out of bounds. at the 46-yard line. So third and five upcoming for the Texans on the game's opening drive. And that's manageable for this offense. You know, they want to stay, love you, in this offense. They want to stay on schedule, try to be in that second, medium, third, and short, give themselves a chance. Because this defense from Philly, they are built to pressure the quarterback. We've seen it all year and how exotic they can get with the different looks and confusing the offensive line on third down. They bring Burkhead back into the backfield on a third and five. And he goes to Burkhead, who was their leading rusher last year. And Rex Burkhead, who's been around for a lot of years, ten specifically, played his college ball way back at Nebraska, breaking a tackle there of Maddox, picks up the first. Yeah, he's just here and he's going to slide out of the backfield. Look at the defense. Look at the second. They're playing zone. just kind of slips out. Now he's got space and he does a heck of a job of making Avante Maddox to Nickelback miss him out in space. That's what it's going to take. Can you make plays out in the open, one-on-one against this Philly secondary? That time, Rex Burkhead who's known for that ability, makes a great play. Already three first downs. Bring the fullback in again. Go play action here. Mills down the sideline and open there off the back shoulder and making the catch. His door set to Sennemi. First down and goal. Threw it over James Bradbury. And what a start for the Texans who looked so inept last Sunday against the Titans. Wow, this is a great call on first and ten after Burkhead picks up the first down on third down. A little out and up, and he goes right by James Bradbury who has, again, come over this year from the Giants. Has had a great year, and I think he's surprised by the speed and the play call from the Texans there on first and ten, but a good call by Pep Hamilton. Three for three for Mills for 48 yards on this drive. A little flip here to Pierce. Threading his way. Takes the ball down to about the one and a half. Boy, you watch these guys last Sunday. They couldn't do anything against Tennessee. The score was close. It was 17-10, late touchdown, but the game wasn't even remotely close. The line of scrimmage, right, on both sides. They ran for 43 yards and it felt a lot worse. The interior of their offensive line with the two guards in the center were just bullied by Jeffrey Simmons and company. And tonight, after everybody poor-mouthing them, and now here they are playing the Eagles, the only undefeated team, at least this first try, they're coming out kind of anxious to prove everybody wrong. They have not scored a single point on an opening drive this season. Second and goal. Play fake. Pass to the end zone. Is hauled in for the touchdown. Quattoriano. One of the tight ends we talked about. Using all of them tonight. Four guys are active. And what a drive. 75 yards, nine plays, five and a half minutes. And they're on top. Watch 42, Kayvon Wallace, because he actually is not surprised. He anticipates. He goes in, then he sees, okay, I've got to look at that delay. He's there. He's in position. But the ball well thrown, and what an adjustment by Quatoriano. It's 6-6 coming back to the ball, known as a blocker. But here, the rookie out of Oregon State shows he's pretty skilled. Manny Fairbarron for the extra point. Well, we told you, don't touch that dial. Early first. Down the field they go, looking very sharp. Sevens for the touchdown. What a way for the rookie to get his first catch. I mean, he earned that. Like I said, Wallace is there. Pretty good position. Well-thrown ball up in the air. And how fitting, Davis Mills says here, big man, you earned that. He's been on IR all season. Active for the first time tonight. So his first catch is a touchdown. First points on the opening drive this season. And now Hertz and company will go to work in a moment. from the three-yard line. Put your cubby. Hit hard. Brings it out to the 23. And we see our first flag of the night. At the 18. Craig Rolstead, tonight's referee. During the return, holding. Receiving team number 54. That penalty is half the distance of the goal. First down. Sean Bradley. so Hertz numbers are great of course when you 7 they figure to be terrific and they are And when you look at TDs and picks 5 racer there rating is well above the league average and he's rushed for 303 yards and six rushing touchdowns. Incredible to watch him in his second year in this system, and how they've really grown and adjusted to his skill set. They're in a good place right now. Third year overall, picked in the second round, back in 2020, the COVID year. takes the snap here, surveys, and just has to throw it into the bench. It'll be second down and ten. Rasheem Green chased him down, second and ten. The big thing that Philly every week wants to know is how does the defense try to defend the explosive ability with A.J. Brown and Devontae Smith on the outside where you can win one-on-one or the run game? So you're going to put two safeties back and worry about that big playability downfield, or are you going to have one safety back and try to load up against this run game? They're just trying to feel it out early here in what Houston might be playing. Got A.J. Brown at the bottom there. He had the three touchdowns last week. Looking for a flag. It was the tight end, Goddard, covered there by the rookie Petrie. No flag. And it will be, well, maybe there is a flag now. It came in at the end. So Goddard did get his wish Petrie passed interference first down Flex Goddard out he'll be in line Here he's flexed out Petrie The rookie gets his left hand after that Nice move there the left arm just grabs Onto the arm Good call there by the officials Boy Goddard you know he's I would put him right up there With some of the elite part of the problem too If you if you take him in a trade He had 18 million guaranteed Next year And, you know, other teams have to look at that and say, how are we doing cap-wise? Second and four. Pierce. Sets up third and one. Kaylee, what you got? Well, Al, with Brandon Cooks not here tonight in his capacity as captain, Laramie Tunsil is wearing the C on his chest for the first time this year. It remains to be seen if he'll continue to do that. Yeah, meanwhile, thank you. Kaley is Fletcher Cox has been a mainstay on that defense for 11 years. And he's the man who needs the attention here. I think one of his own players, Hassan Reddick, got underneath him. He actually has taken on a double team. Fights off of it pretty good. Prevents the tight end from being able to really sustain his block. And then Reddick comes right underneath there. Yep. You know, Philadelphia, they've drafted so well, we'll get into it when we come back. Take a break right here. It'll be third and one when we return. Which is great news. Hope to see him back soon. In the meantime, Javon Hargrave really showed what he can mean to this defensive front last week with the two sacks and, again, active, whether it's a pass rush, whether against a run. Look how quick he is for his size. What I love about him is his motor. Guy never gives up on a play, and it pays off for him with plays like that. So keep an eye on 97 there in the middle. Playing great. So minus Fletcher Cox, at least for one play. It's third down and one. And fighting for it and getting it is Damian Pierce. A little bit of sticks with the clock ticking down to three minutes to go in the half. Cox back in, but he runs right into Hargrave. Hargrave's pushing that pile back. Good effort there also by Marvin Wilson, but the tremendous leg drive of this rookie, Pierce, gives him that first down. Guy runs like he's mad at somebody. He does. He just runs hard. Averaging over four yards per toe tonight on the season, four and a half is his average. and a whistle before the snap on a first down and a timeout taken here by the Texans their first it's a big drive for them they've got to be pretty pleased with the way this game has started you know down seven had that opening drive to just kind of settle end of the game. This is important to try to come away with points here. It's big because Philadelphia's going to get the ball on top of this to start the second half. Remember, early down play action. Even when they give the perception that they're going to run, they'll go with two and three tight end looks, giving the look that they're going to try to pound them up front. And often they do, but tonight they've had a lot of success with Mills going play action and booting the other way. One thing about the Texans, they won 5-1. The games have been close. They've had the lead in every game but one at one point. Had it tonight at 7-0. First down. Pierce again. Off he goes again. Pierce. This rookie is tremendous. Kenyon Green, who was their number one draft choice, the rookie out of Texas A&M, sprung him on that one. You're right. He was able to pull around. Tunsell also comes with him. Little counter play. Bang, right there. Good job of opening up. And, again, with how sudden he is and with his vision, you give him just a little crease, and he gets to that second and third level. And, boy, if you're a defender in the back end, C.J. Gardner-Johnson, you better be ready. Those are two gators colliding head-to-head right there. Gain of 36. That's going to take us to the two-minute warning. And we are back in 30 seconds. They needed a running back. Burkhead was their leading rusher last year with less than 500 yards. And they brought in Mack from Indy. Thought he might help. Marlon Mack. But they looked at Pierce right from the get-go. Catch made here by Tyron Johnson. First time he's been targeted tonight. Takes the ball down to the 19-yard line. Love the approach by Pep Hamilton as a play caller here. Not in a rush. Doesn't want to give the ball back to that explosive Eagles offense. Initially just running the football. Pierce got out and made some big plays. Now he's thinking about trying to put the ball in the end zone. That was their first pass attempt on this round. That right knee looked like it came close to the end. Ooh, it did. Now they're going to try to get this playoff before a challenge And He got it. Yeah, he finally got it. So the word came down from upstairs To Lovie Smith. You should throw the challenge flag here Take a peek. They saw this And from this angle, the knees blew down And he's touched right there Right. But they wanted to get another angle from this angle, clearly. So what was going to be a first down at first, and then a second in inches, and now a third in inches, and the challenge flag is out. Kirk, you made the stop there. Back up. After a view, the runner was touched down while his knee was down at the 28-yard line. It will be fourth and two. Timer, please reset the game clock. Ten minutes and four seconds. Houston will not be charged with a timeout. There it is. Totally down. Touched. So the first two drives in this half, three and out. Kirksey is the guy who put him down. And now Sippis is in to punt for the second time. And Desmond King is set up at his own 24-yard line. Fair catch. Cold for. A year that has not obviously gone the way they had liked, but I think they feel there are pieces here to build around. And with all those draft picks. Pierce Pierce. He's become the most improved player because the guys around him have gotten better. Davis Mills even tonight has shown you what he's capable of doing, So that's not an easy decision to make for Nick and his staff. And tripped up Graham is able to trip up Pierce before he can get started. And it will be third down. Granted, Graham coming off a torn Achilles a year ago. He's found the fountain of youth, much like we talked about earlier on the other side with Jerry Hughes. Talked about collapsing the edges of this defense. They're a very aggressive get upfield, get vertical with their front. And Graham has done a great job of doing that this year. Yeah, like Hughes, each is in his 13th season. Third and six. Pressure on Mills. Look out. Throws. And it's going to be picked at the 42-yard line. Gardner Johnson, his fifth interception of the season. and takes it into Texans territory. C.J. Gardner-Johnson now leading the league in picks with five. Well, we just talked about Brandon Graham, and he brings pressure off the edge. He forces his quarterback, Mills, to step up. Mills takes a chance here. Just completely throws it up in the air. Didn't get anything on it. And I'll tell you, man, C.J. Gardner-Johnson coming over from New Orleans Used to be more up near the line of scrimmage than nickel. What a job he's done. Sitting back. Eyes on the quarterback. Plays that perfectly. Gets his hands underneath it. And comes up with a big interception to give Jalen Hurts and his offense great field position. Came from New Orleans in that trade during training camp. Four straight games with an interception for him. Hurts throws and that's knocked down at the line of scrimmage. Sheem green that time. Good job. He has such length, 6'4". The ball comes out fast with Jalen. Sometimes when they go hurry up, you're going to see that ball come out quickly. Good job of being just an awareness there by Green of getting those hands up quickly. How about the year that he's having? Junior Johnson. Career high in interceptions. Halfway through the year, not even. Second and ten. Hurts. Time, throws, caught, touchdown Brown. Well, you can only keep him down for so long. And the Eagles take the lead. Fly, Eagles, fly. Here we talked about too high safety, which is their bread and butter. This time they go with one safety down the middle. They're not as comfortable playing this. They do it as a changeup, but they don't have the feel or the awareness. And that's where you lose A.J. Brown. Of all people, you can't lose him. Nelson kind of bites up there on Goddard. And a big hole there behind. Just settling in the hole behind the corner in front of the safety. That's perfect. And then the ball's a little high and unable to bring that down. And, boy, Petrie, the rookie, two rookies there. Stingley in front, Petrie behind. And the rookie out of Baylor almost comes up with a pick. What a first half for Brown last week. Not only three touchdown catches, but contested on every one of them. Second and ten. Four-man rush. Hurts fires. Caught. That'll be a first down to the 22-yard line. It was Jack Stoll, the number two tight end. Does a nice job of moving the coverage to the flat. Watch him move at the last minute here. who used his eyes to move the defenders, move those linebackers, and now you've got a nice throwing lane to be able to give it to Goddard with a chance to do something after the catch. Again, no huddle. Come up initially in the pistol. Now flanked by Sanders. On the move and throws incomplete. He was pressured that time. Tried to get it to Stoll. And it'll be second down and 10. They put the heat on him. Lovie Smith is moving guys around, trying to slant, angle, bring the linebacker pressure here, move the defensive line, just trying to create some matchups against this very talented offensive line. They worked so well as a unit. At that time, they were able to get home, and a good job by bringing Kirksey. He timed that up perfectly. One thing to get to him, but you've got to contain him. You can't let him get outside of the pocket like he did earlier. Now from the pistol. Sanders. One thing about the Houston defense, better against the pass than the run. They were roadkill last week against Tennessee with Derrick Henry. What a Tennessee. One pass attempt in the second half? Right. You knew they were going to run, and you still couldn't stop them. Over 300 yards for Tennessee last week, running 40 passes. Yeah. Yeah. So it was one-dimensional attack, and yet Tennessee did a great job of controlling things up front. for Houston tonight the emphasis is tackling they've had some real concerns coming up in run support 14th play of Philadelphia's first drive third and eight Hurts open, caught, first and goal Dallas Goddard calls it in Petrie on the coverage there Hirsch is 7 of 11 for 71 on the drive. You don't reroute the tight end, and you know Lovie Smith is going to play Tampa too, meaning you're looking for that hole behind the corner in front of the safety. It's perfectly thrown football. And down goes the quarterback here, Desmond King. Powers through into the backfield. Takes him down for a loss. It'll be second and goal back of the eight-yard line. He didn't care if he handed it off or not. He was going in to take Jalen Hurts out. You know, whether he handed that ball off or not from the backside, he said in case he has it, he's going down. Nice play, Desmond King. Very aggressive, plays a lot of nickel, but they'll move him outside as well tonight. Second goal. Little flip. that's the back nice move there by gainwell to take the ball to the one yard line and we talked about tackling and how that's been a problem for them they had him probably down at about the six five or six yard line but again he's able to give him credit low center gravity but guys got to wrap up. Kelsey's trying to drag him. Yeah. That last yard or so. 83 missed tackles. Only the Jaguars have missed more. 17th play of this drive. Which has taken half the quarter. Three tight ends. Third and goal. On the ground. And Sanders is going to be stopped just outside the one. So with two minutes to go in the quarter, fourth and goal going for it here. Coming up the 18th play of a drive that's taken seven and a half minutes. You and I were kidding in the meeting this morning with our team. We were talking about where are the Texans strong, and you brought up, hey, they are defensively the best in the league at goal to go. Here's their first test. Here they are, fourth and goal. tight ends in this NFL in the NFL a lot of people talk about Kittle and Kelsey and got it right there with him well when he began to come along they knew they could trade Zach Ertz and send him to Arizona handoff here threading his way over the left side goes Miles Sanders up to the 21-yard line. Sanders coming into the game. Good season for him, averaging almost five yards per carry. So you're going to see a lot of RPO, and the vision is on the linebacker. If that linebacker chases the back, then he'll throw the slant right here. I think he feels that he's holding position, so he hands it off. There's a lot of those games that will happen tonight. No huddle on second and six. Good protection, but the pass is not there. Goddard was free in the middle. Couldn't get it into his hands. And it will be third down and six for Philadelphia. Trying to go a little bit fast here. Trying to get this defense on its heels on second down. They had a seam there. Right now, I mentioned how Houston playing with either two safeties or one. They've been giving them a lot of one safety look. Now they'll split their safeties here on this third down. Running back is Kenneth Gainwell, third down and six. Hurts, flushed out, signals downfield, throws, finds a wide open man, plays Watkins up to the 45-yard line. So on third and six, he's tackled there by Jonathan Owens. The pass is good for 23. This is the danger of having a mobile quarterback, and he can get outside of that pressure. They do not keep him in the pocket, And this is where Jalen Hurst is so dangerous with his eyes downfield on third down. Up tempo they go again. Pass comes out here. Now Watkins makes another catch. And it's a short game before he is out of bounds. Second down. Petrie forced him out there. Second and eight. That is Shane Steichen. He is the offensive coordinator. Last year, Suriani, whose pedigree is offense, was calling the plays at the beginning of the year. Then he brought Steichen in to call some of the plays. This year, Steichen's calling all of the plays. Yeah, and like I said earlier, it's amazing how he is really in his second year in this system. It's amazing how they've adjusted this offense to more of what Jalen Hurts does well, and more naturally, he's played in rhythm all year. Quick throw out here, and the tackle is made immediately on Devontae Smith by Stephen Nelson, who's well known to Devontae because the two were playing together in Philadelphia last season. A quick read on a lot of these quick throws that Philly likes to do. It puts pressure on the corners. Because if you don't react this quick, you're going to have another receiver trying to block here. A tight end, in this case, in Goddard. But he got underneath of that and made that play quickly. That's a great job there by Stephen Nelson. Third down and eight. Hurts throws dropped and then in court it's A.J. Brown Brown makes the grab I thought it looked like the right tackle started early for Philadelphia there's no flag looking for the flag there was no I'm with you he's gotten out early a couple times that time it was really early I'm surprised they didn't call that one yeah that was Lane Johnson got away with one there Hurts on the run throws. That's caught. Gain of nine. That's Gainwell making the catch. Perksy with the tackle there. Second down and one. This is what they like to do, especially when they start to pick up some conversions. They really like to crank the tempo right up the wheelhouse of Jalen Hurts going back to his college days at Alabama and especially at Oklahoma in his last year. Not letting the Texans make any defensive adjustments. Gainwell again to the 35-yard line. Let's go back to that third down play and watch the right tackle Johnson. Here he is. Does he start early? Yeah, that right leg kick. Yeah. It turned out to be a nine-yard gain, so it was six minutes to go in the quarter. They have it at the 35-yard line. This will be the tenth play of the drive, which started back at their own nine-yard line. Fake to Sanders. Deep drop. Down the sideline. A little too high. Almost picked off. Brown couldn't handle it. Petrie was right there. It'll be second down and ten. H.A. Brown does a really good job of getting behind Derek Stingley. This week on Sunday against Pittsburgh. Second and one. College football game here, breaking out with this tempo. This is what we see every Saturday. Like I said, Jalen Hurts, this is what he did in college. Very comfortable with it. Second and two from the pistol. Sanders, close to a first down. Stop him at the 11-yard line. Jerry Hughes is there. Now this is a great read on Jerry Hughes. If he takes the quarterback, you give it. If he takes the back, you keep it. He's reading that end man. You make the decision. I mean, didn't it look like he was collapsing down on the running back, and at the very last second he jumped out to Hertz. That's why he ended up giving that. Good job staying on the ride there. Third down, one half yard to go. Yeah, Rolstad, Sirianni said, I thought it was a first down. He moved it back about a half a yard to make it third down. And, of course, when you put your palm up in the air like that, it means we start the play clock at 25. Which they do. Third and one. They've been about as good as anybody in the league at these short yardage situations. A lot of time, even last week, you think they're going to run, and sometimes they'll surprise you with boots or nakeds get the ball outside. They tighten up here. to the outside. Hurts. He's now 14 of 16 on third or fourth and one. Those are Brady-like numbers. No doubt about it. That's not a sneak there, of course. No, but why? Guess it anyway. Yeah, you've got Goddard right behind him, and you're allowed to do this, get behind. That's just smart, just an awareness there by Jalen Hurts instead of just a sneak. Everybody pinches down. He says, okay, I'm an athlete. I'm going to take this. I'm going to try to take it to the end zone. Easily gets the first. First and goal. Through the middle. Sanders. Big half for him. Second down and goal. Heinish making the tackle there. Sanders is now carried eight times for 54 yards and a touchdown. It's great to see him healthy. You know, he's battled through some years where he just hasn't been 100% healthy so far this year. What a compliment to what they do in their pass game. Nice patience with those jump cuts there. Second and goal. Hurts keeps it. He gets smothered. A little bit about the line of scrimmage. Philadelphia already with more than 200 yards of total offense. Third and goal. I'm sorry, Al. This time he gets it. Hughes again. If he collapses down, you pull it. If he stays wide, you're going to give it. He gives the impression that he's coming down and then jumps out on that zone read. That is not predetermined. He's trying to determine which way 55 is going, and that time gives Hughes credit. He caught him. And Owens up from the secondary to help out at the end. Third and goal. Spread it out. Now Gainwell comes back into the backfield. Give it to him. Gainwell. Touchdown. broke away from Rasheem Green and another long drive this one 79 yards 10 plays to put Philly on top again you get behind the left side of that offensive line and they're going to lead you there watch the guard here Dickerson being able to sustain that block on Christian Harris those are two guys that are very familiar with each other both playing at Alabama good block there and then tough running to get it into the end zone. Elliott tacking on point number 14. Four and a half to go in the opening half in Houston on this Thursday night. Eagles by seven. So kickoff through the end zone. So Brandon Cooks if you join the slate not playing tonight, wanted to be traded. Of course, the rumor mill had them going to Dallas, down the line. They don't play for ten more days. We'll see what happens with Brandon Cooks, who is no stranger to getting traded. Big hole, and a nice tackle there for a six-yard gain. Taken down there by Marvin Wilson, second and four. Kind of a strange circumstance. He's a captain of the offense, and Lovie Smith says that he will be back in the building on Monday. Just signed a two-year extension seven months ago. Ball handed off and into the end zone goes Sanders over the left side for the touchdown. 91 yards. They ran it six times. They threw it 12. You don't see very many 18 play drives. So each team looking sharp on their opening salvo. Well, if you're getting short yardage, this is a safe place to go with Goddard to tight end, Malata, the left tackle, and the big left guard, Landon Dickerson. Good patience there, and of course, Sanders able to walk in with a nice job by the left side of the line. Jake Elliott. Ties the game. Well, long drive by Houston. Philly counters. Minute and a half to go in the quarter. 7-7 on Thursday night. Because Lovie Smith was not very happy and will tell you why. Here's Elliott to kick off. And the 25, there was a question as to whether Kelsey was pulling Sanders into the end zone. That's what Lovie Smith was fired up about. It was Gainwell, actually. Well this was Gainwell We showed you this on the replay 62 grabs a hold of him and says come on I get you in there Terry what are your thoughts on this Yes it interesting We saw the Houston players react. Well, a video went out to the clubs this week about assisting the runner. That's a 10-yard penalty. So that's why the players from Houston all realized, and Lovie Smith realized, that should have been a 10-yard penalty for assisting the runner. Right, and brought them back to the 11. Meanwhile, they start this drive. Here's Pierce again. and again good tough running gain of five we go to Kaylee yeah first we saw the frustration from Jerry Hughes coming off the field he had a conversation with Lovey before you knew it Lovey was up there talking to the referee expressing exactly what Terry just described it looked to them like Gainwell was pulled by Kelsey closer to that goal line but doesn't sound like the Texans are getting the penalty that they were arguing for no they did not The one thing I would say is I think he was down earlier and then pulled potentially after being called down. But at any rate, it was not called. Well, there's Kenyon Green who might be bleeding here, reaching for his eye. And he's the left guard, the rookie out of Texas A&M, their number one pick. He comes out. Casey McDermott comes in in that spot. And here goes the rookie again, Pierce. Again, good, tough running and a first down. Yeah, really good running. And now you're seeing a first drive you saw a mixed bag of some double teams. There's Green, of course, trying to get loose and hopefully able to come back. But some double team runs and some early play action passes. Here's his replacement, McDermott. There's those double teams I'm talking about. Those big men up front with Fletcher Cox and Javon Hargrave. Hargrave, and they need those double teams to try to get a push to work up to those backers. Kirsten in fullback. Throws the block, but coming off that block and making the stop there was Marcus Epps, along with Hassan Redick, who has five and a half sacks in his first year with Philadelphia. And that'll take us to the break. Spirited first quarter. And a rapid one. 7-7 our score. End of one. back in that first drive. It's always about starting fast. We did that whenever you can get the ball and drive down. Now we mix it up, running the ball, passing. Good initial drive by offense. We need to follow that up now. Yeah, you made Philadelphia work for it to get in the end zone there, but what do you need to do to contain them moving forward? We missed a couple of big third downs, but we have to be able to convert defensively. We had our opportunities. Yes, convert on third downs. All right, thank you, Kaylee. as Lovey checks in here. Second down 11. We start the second quarter. And working his way out to the 40 goes Previn Jordan. So Davis Mills coming out of high school, Greater Atlanta Christian School. Number one ranked high school quarterback in the class of 17. Decides to go to Stanford. Placing only 14 games over three seasons there. Third round pick. And of course, when he came here, They had Deshaun Watson, but he was out for that whole season. So they gave it to him at least for this year. We'll see what happens. Will he hold the job? Because they have a ton of team of ball. Robert Quinn is in the game. Traded over from Chicago last week. And they bottle up Pierce here at the 50-yard line. And speaking of Quinn, he's right in on the stop. and he just wins against Atkins, the tight end, known again as a pass rusher, but watch him use his hands and then use extension to get off of that block. He just kind of holds the edge of the defense, something that Jonathan Gannon really hits home on, on these edge players, not just rushing the quarterback, making sure you blow those edges up. He did it there. Third and nine. four man rush spinning away but not quickly enough and sacked at the 44 javon hargrave fourth down well he was a handful last week against pittsburgh here he is right here he's just going to use quickness and power two sacks last week this guy's really starting to come into his own jg the defense coordinator telling us this week he said You know, he's one of those practice guys. He hadn't been able to practice until the last three or four weeks, and now he's really starting to come on the combination of power and quickness. Second punt for Cameron Johnston. Covey is there. Collects at the 13. Returns to the 21. Ten minutes to halftime. Houston, 7-7. Down the middle to Ryan Howard. Big fella. With a hard slider, too. Yeah. With the black of the plate. Xfinity live in Philadelphia, PA. Watching their Phillies. Watching their Eagles. What a night. Their soccer team is going to go to the finals in the MLS. What a time for Philly. Yep. From the 21-yard line, Eagles begin this drive. Sanders to the outside gets by Petrie knocks over another man and picks up 13 yards Owens makes the stop there love to see the blocking A.J. Brown gets a nice block to kind of seal the edge and how about Zach Paschal he's known for his physicality and these defensive backs know it Desmond King 25 getting out of there but it's a good job of running but sustaining the blocks on the perimeter a big part of what these Philadelphia wide receivers do. Good job there by Fastwood. Guys are getting knocked over like bowling pins from the 34-yard line. First down. Big gaping hole for Sanders to the 41-yard line. He goes. Run out there by Owens. Miles Sanders shredding that run defense. That's good for 25 yards. Milada gets a nice block on the kickout. And then what's interesting is watch this block right here by the left guard, Dickerson. He kind of lets his guy go. They end up trapping him on a wham block by Dallas Goddard. Unique design. And, man, did that hit quick for this offense. Nice play and good run there by Sanders. Sanders gets a rest. Six carries, 47 yards. Boston Scott in the game at running back. He gets repositioned. Off the right flank. And takes it. And Scott. That a five-yard game for him. Hanson and Petrie making the stop there. I mean, I love to watch Jason Kelsey play. 34 years old, 12th year. This guy pulls as well as anybody in the game. Still at 34. He gets out in front. And even if he's not able to lead out to the outside, he doesn't get that. Just taking on that linebacker, sustaining that block. I mean, if you love line play, how can you not love Jason Kelsey? That guy is a stud. 130 straight starts. Might have hurt his brother as well. Travis, second and five. Flip here. Put up the screen. Got it on the run. And he gets taken down at the 20-yard line. You know, you've got to worry so much about the downfield throws to all these big, talented receivers. Your eyes can get lulled to sleep. And now you've got to watch Kelsey get not pulling, but now he's out in front on a screen. Really well-timed by that offensive line, not selling it too early. Well, he's back here again. And that is caught. And the 12-yard line goes Zach Paschal. He got into the end zone left. And caused that holding call. Now you've got him behind the sticks. In the old days, you would never see nine holding seven tight end holding a linebacker. They changed the numbering system a couple of years ago. You can wear what you want, just about. Second and 20. Damian Pierce. Next-gen stats, powered by AWS. Take a look. There you go. He's been obviously effective tonight. Running with great strength, lower body. Look at the yards after contact. He's third in the NFL with yards after contact, and we knew coming in he was going to be a factor. Philadelphia knew coming in he was going to be a factor, but still to have a good first half says a lot about the way the line's playing and the way he has started this game. Second and 20. Here he is again, and he's contacting the evening. What did we hear this morning that before contact, he gained something like one-tenth of one yard? In other words, three-and-a-half inches? Yeah, you were measuring that all year, right? Oh, absolutely. How do they measure that? I have no idea. I mean, I don't have a clue. I can measure this. 94, Sweat. You know, the thing about this defense is you get so caught up in other aspects of rushing the passer. I'll tell you, man, these guys on the edge play great. Graham, Sweat, Redick, Quinn. Third and 22. Pass here, Chris Moore, who scored the touchdown at the end of the first half. To the 33 where he's tackled by Darius Slay. So a slow start for both teams beginning the second half. Go back to that first and ten play when Hassan Redick got upfield and gave tremendous effort forcing Brevin Jordan to have to hold him to prevent the sack. Got him way behind the sticks and now you get Houston off the field. third punt for Cameron Johnston is a beauty they're going to let it go it bounces at the five and then skids into the end zone the punt performance so far the release time you know the mechanics have cleaned up so much with Jalen I think he's more comfortable with the scheme the ball gets out quicker And with this Tampa 2 defense, two safeties back, that hole shot is open, and he's been hitting it three or four times in that first half to his big tight end, Dallas Cotter. Hurts coming back to his hometown. First time he's played as a pro in the city. First time he's played, period, in the stadium. Big gaping hole again in the first half for Sanders. on the first play of this drive. Mom is here. Mother Pamela is looking on tonight. There she is. And off her right shoulder is Sister Kennedy. Dad is getting his high school team ready for action this weekend. They're having a great year. Stressful watching a son, right? Playing quarterback, even as good as Jalen Hurts is. Well, they're going to mark it just shy of the 30-yard line to the consternation of the Eagle fans, and there are plenty of them here tonight. So second and inches and not a first down. You're going to love it. Perfect. That's effort right there. Major. How long do you think that took him with the whole green? Face. That's some time. 3.4 weeks according to AWS. Second in inches. Sanders, and he's going to get bottled up. So now you've got originally what looked to be a first down. Christian Harris is there to make the stop. And all of a sudden you've got third in inches. Landon Dickerson, the left guard, makes a good block coming across. But it's Christian Harris that's able to navigate his way through and get up before that first down marker. Nobody's able to get up to him, give the defensive line a lot of credit to be able to free him up. They have high hopes what he can be, just a young player, first year out of Alabama. Sanders again, and this time he keeps the lights going and will in all likelihood pick up the first down as the officials come in and mark it. And he says, what about now? Finally? Yes. They brought Lane Johnson, the right tackle over here. It's an unbalanced look. And you've got a tight end and stole. I mean, they went heavy. Then you bring the right guard. Draft picks coming up in the next two drafts. We'll see what happens. Third down and six. And that's going to set him back five yards. That's Laramie Tunsil One of the best left tackles in the league Now just to add to that I think because of the way he finished last year He and Tyrod Taylor are kind of going back and forth I think he showed enough glimpses for the coaches to say You know what, we're young, we're rebuilding I think we're okay here at quarterback And I think he could be our guy with Pep Hamilton coming in To be the offensive coordinator His system kind of fits him and they've given him his chance this year. He had a tremendous game against the Patriots last year. Tonight he started 5 of 5 for 55 yards, so perfectly symmetrical. And his sixth pass instead will be a run as he takes off and gets spun down up at the 43-yard line, taken down by Maddox and Epps there. And the punt group will come in. And he told us on our call with him that he wanted to use his feet more. He's seen some of these quarterbacks around the league that on third downs can become a defense's worst nightmare by trying to create. And he is a great athlete. So he has been emphasizing. It almost came up with it, but it comes up a little short. Yeah. Got eight. Needed 11. Cameron Johnston. A former Eagle now punting for the Texans. Sends that one inside the 10, and it will bounce into the end zone. and Hurston taking over the 20 Sam Houston's statue and never plays again for Alabama at least as a starter meanwhile off to the races goes A.J. Brown takes it over the middle gets tripped up at midfield by Jonathan Owens it's a game of 31 so here's the challenge with play action on the backers watch how they get downhill concerned about that running game you get caught up with Goddard He gets caught up with a play action. Opens up a lane behind him. Blitz coming. They get to him, but he gets it away anyway, and Smith makes the grab. And just like that to the 25-yard line, Herchie came up the middle. Herch gets hit as he throws, but he's right on the money anyway for 22. Boy, a tough ask of Steven Nelson. A crossing route against Devontae Smith. Often gets overlooked because of all the attention on 11, A.J. Brown. But how about the speed across the middle? Hurts this time loses the ball and the Texans Stephen Nelson coming in and Houston with the turnover Jalen Hurts had no idea the ball was coming up caught him by surprise only Philadelphia's third turnover of the Molo is gonna touch Kelsey to let him know okay, we're ready to go, but he doesn't touch him, and yet we still get the snap. Now, Jalen has it, but the play just is out of sync. And then you throw in the blitz off the edge by Steven Nelson, and Jalen Hurts never saw it coming, unable to protect the ball, and that's the first fumble lost in the entire year for this Philly offense. Absolutely. Two interceptions were the only two turnovers. They have 16 takeaways, and now they're plus 13 in the give-take ratio. No other team is better than plus six. You asked me in the open, how do they make it a competitive game? Mixing up some play action, running the football, and then getting some breaks like that. Obviously, to get the ball back. Fake toss. Mills rolls. Open. This is going to be a first down on a 14-yard gain before O.J. Howard is taken out of bounds. And we've got a theme going right now with Pep Hamilton, which is not a shock, and Philly New coming in with Jonathan Gannon as the defensive coordinator. Yeah, they're going to run the ball. Yeah, their top two receivers are out. But, guys, first and ten, we can't overflow. Can't be too aggressive. We've got to be disciplined because right now the best throwing that Houston's had is play action on first and ten when that fast-flowing defense is out of position. Go three tight here. Mills, good protection, a little high. And a footnote on Stephen Nelson who created the fumble. His 106th game in the NFL, his first sack. Against the guy he was practicing against last year. Yeah, and think about some of the defenses he played in and how aggressive they've been in Kansas City, Pittsburgh, and Philly. That's pretty impressive. He threw in the league. And he'll take it to the 13-yard line. And the longtime former Patriot, Rex Burkhead, led the team in rushing last year. Started with Cincinnati, first down. Pep Hamilton is loving what he's seeing from this offensive line, getting positive yards on first and ten. And these drives that have been effective, he's mixed up the looks, the personnel groupings, formations, trying to make Philly have to adjust. And this line is getting off the ball again. It's like watching a different team from last week against Jeffrey Simmons and that talented Titans front to tonight. So the defensive coordinator, Jonathan Gannon, watching his team trying to stop these guys. From the moment they stop Pierce, close to the line of scrimmage. The rookie, Kenyon Green, out of Texas A&M last week, there are a lot of guards that go up against Jeffrey Simmons and wish they didn't. And being a young player, you wondered how it would affect his confidence. And it's, man, he's done a nice job of putting that one behind him and putting his best foot forward, using that as a learning experience and playing much better tonight. Second and ten. Pierce, wiggling. But the defense is right there to stop him. So upcoming is a pretty key third down and nine, under two to play in the third. You've got to love that beard, don't you? We asked Lovey, is there a shelf life on this? He says, my wife of 42 years loves it. That's it. End of story. That's it. Yeah, there you go. Case closed. So the left comes along with an offer to save it, right? There you go. Third and nine. Burkhead staying in. Mills looks toward Burkhead. throws corner of the end zone incomplete a lot of action down there that's White with Burkhead and it's fourth down and in comes the field goal group good job here I mean you know that Burkhead is going to sneak out of the backfield and you're going to get a linebacker matched up on him and this is where Mills wants to buy some time but there's just nobody open he tries to bring Burkhead back hoping for worst case maybe get a pass interference call But for best case, get a pass interference call, just unable to get it. Jamie Fairbairn from 30. Bangs that one through. And so, in the waning moments of five in eight games. Pretty amazing to watch, too, and the way he's rebounded from that game that you and I had in Cincinnati. And a new system with what they're doing down there with Mike McDaniel. and I think it's just how he's processing things. I mean, there were a lot of people, much like Jalen Hurts, ready to get rid of him, ready to say he's not the guy. Right. And now he and Jalen have become the stories in the first half of the season. What if Miami meets Philadelphia in the Super Bowl? You've got Tua and Hurts, and Tua took over for Hurts. What a story. And then Hurts was sat on the bench, of course, went to Oklahoma, finished second to Burrow in the Heisman balloting. Not that that would be a storyline. Right. I think everybody's just happy to see him healthy playing, let alone how well he's playing. All right. So, next week, to Charlotte. We go Falcons against the Panthers. Talked about that crazy game last Sunday. So, let's see what happens. Yeah, I will say this. Steve Wilkes has Carolina playing and believing. I mean, if they would have finished that game off last week, look at the standings in that division. Somebody's got to win. And whoever wins gets a wild card home game, too. Right. 1.15 to go in the third. From the 25, this drive begins with a play fake and a roll and a throw that's caught for a seven-yard gain. Got it. Bounced out of bounds by Petrie. Hughes put the heat on that time. Second and three. So look at this. In 2020, a little bit more than half his throws were complete. Last year, about five out of eight. This year, two out of three. Incredible to see. And I think you look at those numbers, you say, wow, he's obviously gotten better. I think there's more to it. I think that you've got to give credit to this staff for adjusting their scheme once they got to know him better second half of last year and then into this offseason, into this year, where they've developed their scheme and their attack around what he does best. Play out. And they're just going to try to draw him offside. Yeah, I mean, to go for it here and not make it, well, maybe. Timeout is pulled first By Philadelphia That was odd Right It's almost like they sent him in and said trying to draw him offside Then they were going to run the play But if you run the play, you run the rest of, you know You give the Texans some semblance of a chance with a short field on a fourth down Well, you got this big offensive line, you got an athletic quarterback Come up again. Do they run it again? They won't run it up the middle. They'll go outside if they do. Still trying to draw him off. Yep. Burge will now take it. And in comes the official. Going to be close. And they rule it a first down over the protestations of the defense here. It's that right foot. I asked him about, you know, is that trying to be a decoy to make people think you're not going to do the, or you are going to do it? And he said, kind of leave that up to their imagination. I didn't think he got it initially. Neither did I. I mean, you know, at what point is play stopped? Good push there by Gainwell. A little bit of a gamble, but it turns out to be no problem. Yes, Sirianni says, you got it. Well, so what did we learn tonight? We learned that Pierce is a heck of a running back. We learned that the Texans responded. We learned that Houston covered. And the two-point conversion made a difference to other people. And the Eagles 8-0 for the first time. We covered the whole world here, folks. Yeah, we got it. Like Sherwin Williams. We just cover the whole, we cover the earth. The other thing we learned is that Philly, great teams win when they don't play their best. Right. And that's what they did tonight. On the road, gets the team that they were supposed to blow out. Didn't necessarily bring all the emotion, but found a way to win ugly. They'll be able to learn from this, and that'll probably be the last one they have of the year. Yeah, they've got a week and a half off now. They've got the mini-bye. They play Washington next, then go to Indy, and then Green Bay comes to Philadelphia. Texas, meanwhile, there's Pep Hamilton with Hurts. They face Saquon Barkley and the Giants in their next game. So, there you have it, folks. 29-17, don't go anywhere. Carissa and the gang wrap things up from Houston. The Google Pixel postgame show. Six yards on the ground. Boston Scott into the backfield. Hurts throwing. Open. Who else? Goddard. Touchdown. Well, Houston was going to be tight end prevalent tonight, but it's Philadelphia that's made the most use out of their guy. Great call by Steinkin, the offensive coordinator on first and ten. They just hit the zone read. And now you go, you give that action, you freeze that in man on the line of scrimmage, and then you bring Goddard from the other side. He's all alone out in the flat. And before the conversion attempt, we will hear from... Rolstead. Every conference. I think what Sirianni is saying, if it's against the defense, he could move the ball to the one. Offside defense. Philadelphia has elected to enforce the play from the two-yard line to the one-yard line and go for two points. Yeah, so it's so interesting how when you see that, He set it for the extra point but that one yard takes a coach from one to two Very often Steichen the offensive coordinator with such a bright future You right Then the analytics come into play right I guess. You're in charge of analytics. Oh, yes. Analyze this. Boston Scott, the running back. He moves. Sotas got it into the slot and into the end zone for a two-point conversion. Goes number one. 29-17. Hurts with the pass. And then he goes. A grease. What game you got this week? Game day, I have Tennessee and Georgia, which is a big showdown. After that, I'll fly down to Baton Rouge for LSU and Alabama. Two big ones. Kaylee, what's shaking down there? Well, Al, tonight on the Texans sidelines, there you have their second round pick, John Mechie, a source of inspiration if there ever was one. He was diagnosed with leukemia just before his rookie season started. He spent a month and a half in the hospital for treatment. Now he tells me he is halfway through his outpatient chemotherapy regimen. Just as important to his recovery, he told me, has been getting back into a routine with his teammates. He says, this is what I know. This is where I'm most comfortable. And Damian Pierce told me Mechie has been working out with them like he could suit up tonight. Yeah, that's great. It's good to see him. Between this guy, Pierce, and getting Mechie back next year, and all of their draft picks, They're kind of set up. There is Devontae Smith, his former teammate. And before the game, the two getting together. You throw Jalen Waddle into the mix. It was a tight-knit group when they were in Tuscaloosa. And just like a brotherhood, as you would expect. They've had some great receivers go through that room. But you're right, Al. I agree with Pierce, some of these younger tight ends, and Mechie coming in. second and eight Mills deep downfield and that's incomplete flag is thrown though Dorsett the intended receiver got hit late flag is in the offensive backfield for what appears to be a late hit Targrave got in there personal foul roughing the passer defense number 94 15 yard penalty and automatic first down 97 But Hargrave, who's had a big night, just hits him late after the throw. Again, I'd love to hear Terry's thoughts. The modern world of the National Football League, your thoughts on that call, Terry? Yeah, Kirk, it doesn't appear late. It looks like it's within one step, and I don't see head and neck area. I mean, in real time, obviously they're going to lean toward calling a foul as a big hit. But I don't believe it was on replay. But it cost him 15. I'm telling you, he's going up against one of the best in the NFL right now on the inside. Hargrave, look at the power he has in his lower body. You add the quickness and the burst. Green is a big man just getting pushed right into the quarterback. Yeah, pick your poison when it comes to that defensive line. Redick as well. Johnson now punt on a fourth and 14. trying to pin the Eagles deep and a fair catch to score for and made at the 10 by Covey. Here's the heart rate. The lead would be 8-0. So what do they have coming up here? All right, Washington next week at Indy. Green Bay, 3-5. Tennessee, interesting. At the Giants, at Chicago, at Dallas. You've got those three road games in the room. and then New Orleans and the Giants to wrap it up. Interesting. From the 10-yard line, nothing. Stuffed in the backfield is Sanders. That NFC East has changed drastically. Jeff Lurie bought this team in the mid-90s. Tina is there as well. He's done a great job. It's an organization that has a tremendous amount of respect the way it's been run around the National Football League. Great respect. The alignment between ownership, general manager, and head coach. Huge. Perfect. Second and 12. Hurts. Woo. Avoids the sack for the moment and then gets taken down at the four-yard line. Got Jerry Hughes coming in to get things started. Third and long. You talk about a matchup. Jerry Hughes against Lane Johnson. The right tackle who's had a great night and having a great year. He fakes outside, which has he been doing all night, and then cuts back underneath. Somehow Hurts gets away from that, and he's attacking that ball. He knows his team's down. Almost gets that ball the second time he's almost gotten it away from Jalen Hurts. This is big right here. If you can pin him and maybe get good field position, And down by 12, he got a shot under seven to play. Philly has other ideas. And buying a lot of room, at least for the punts, goes Gainwell out to the 12-yard line. They have moved Hughes around right, usually on the right side. The time when he came up almost was a strip sack there on the left. And defense doing their job. They, again, get Philly off the field. Desmond King is back Aaron Sippis with his third punt of the night King Fair catch 38 yard line Good boot right there. Gained 50 yards. Meanwhile, next week, we go to Carolina. We go to Charlotte. Panthers and Falcons beating for the second time in a couple of weeks. Last week, that unbelievable game. And there are the South standings right now. Atlanta will be in the first place. Buccaneers face the Rams this week. New Orleans has Baltimore on Monday night. And the Panthers 2-6. Mills. And that's incomplete, trying to get it out there to Pearson. You know, that two-point conversion was significant to the extent that if it was an 11-point lead at 28-17, you'd have a field goal touchdown. Sure. Now you need two touchdowns. Yeah, and you're asking an offense that has their top two receivers out to get into predictable play calling because it's under six to go and needed a couple scores. All of a sudden you're asking Chris Moore and Phillip Dorsett and Tyron Johnson, guys that usually are not out there, they've got to make plays, and the line's got to hold up. Hill slides to his left, open, and making the grab is Dorsett. beats Kayvon Walniss on the play and big chunky yardage there will take the ball down to the 35. Busting coverage and Dorsett capitalizes the two corners sitting there. You can see them right there. Both went up to the flat. Nobody got it. Gives the Texans a first down trying to scramble back into it. And Pierce doing his best out to the 46-yard line. Fletcher Cox in on the tackle. Second down and six. People that are just tuning in or going back and forth maybe between the World Series. It's a 14-14 game, not just at halftime, with about eight and a half minutes to go in the third quarter. In Philadelphia, their first two offensive possessions, three and outs. Then they get the interception. The one mistake that Davis Mills has made, the interception deep in his own territory, gave Philly and Nick Sirianni the ball at the 17, and they were able to punch it in for a touchdown, and that really changed the complexion of the game from that point forward. Yeah, Sirianni talking about the personal foul. Mills will keep it himself, and he will die for a first down, getting into eagle territory to the 45-yard line. He's a man of his word. He told us this week when we talked with him, he's like, I'm an athletic guy. I've got to challenge myself to use my legs more instead of forcing some shots downfield. and it's about the third or fourth time we've seen him feel an opening, trust his legs, and pick up a first down. Mills also said in preseason, we're here to shock the world. That's right. They win tonight's game, they will have shocked the world. Yeah. Of course, he told him that. From the 47 to the outside. I mean, this game starts, let's face it, the Eagles probably... On the road at 1-5-1 Houston. And then a break. Not necessarily shocked, but give Houston credit. They played well. Yeah, and making the grab along the sideline. And he is in. As the officials confer. Yep, 28-yard line. Brevin Jordan, the tight end. Watch this. Left foot down. Right toe. Me. Don't know about that. The heel got down and then the toe came. Yeah, that's right. Philadelphia's going to challenge. They see the same thing you just saw. What an effort. Yep. So that would have been good for 19. That was a second and 10, which will make it third and 10 if it's overturned. One down, the other one skidding. Philadelphia's challenging rolling on the field of a completed catch. Okay. Terry, I'd love to ask you because I think something. Oh, we've got to come back. We've got to sell some product first. I'm trying to get to it. Kaylee down there, and they look at what she sees. Kelsey said, no way. That's incomplete. They know. That's incomplete. They got that figured out. Can we ask Terry just to finish that? A thousand percent. Terry, sometimes fans, I think, get a little confused with the right foot was in and then the left foot, the heel, toe touched. Sure, Kirk. Anytime the foot comes down in one step, all in one continuous motion, if it touches out of bounds, it's incomplete. It's out of bounds. And that is, and Kelsey's right, this is an incomplete pass. Because that's exactly what happens here. Heel touches a little bit first. Toe comes down. All in one step. Boom. Incomplete. And that's going to make it third down and ten. See, Terry just says he's decisive. Bang. Perfect. And yet, and yet. That's why Terry, Terry, referee three Super Bowls. I know. Come on. Just, boom. He just comes in here. And then said, enough of that zebra nonsense. I'm going to sit in the studio and the green room. Got a nice tie going. The whole thing going on. It's perfect. As do you. Right. Looking for the spot right now. It's going to be overturned. Sirianni knows it. How much fun was that talking to him last night? I feel like we could have gone for hours talking to him about football. I was ready to play for him. I know. Man, what energy. Genuine, though. Like, genuine, authentic. Right. See why his guys love him. Why they're off to the start. The runner did not get both feet down in bounds. Therefore, it's incomplete pass. It'll be third down and 10 at the 47-yard line. All right, back to the 47 and a third and 10. Philadelphia will not be charged for the team timeout. A 48 left in the fourth. Well, great effort nonetheless. Jordan, you know, in an offense that likes to play two and three tight ends, he's going to be a guy that's going to have to continue to grow second year out of Miami. He's kind of been quiet this year. But Pep Hamilton telling us he and Jordan Aikens are going to have to be the two guys that make those kind of plays. Third and ten. Mills under pressure, and the Eagles get to him. Hargrave. Busting through again. Fourth down. Green, the rookie, has had a pretty good night. Action second and three. Pressure again. Heat coming from all angles and all sides. But he'll keep it himself and pick up the first down. Escaping everybody on that defense. And he's a different kind of quarterback as far as his ability to escape. He's more physical. It's not the suddenness or the quickness. he's got more power to be able to pull away from arm tackles and then the speed to be able to know exactly where he's going. His situational awareness is probably an area that's been a strength of his entire career. And that will take us to the end of the third quarter. Philadelphia 21 on top in that division. Now Michaels, Kirk, Curbstreed, Kaylee Hartung, four-point game from the 37-yard line. Philadelphia starts with a flip to Sanders and about an eight-yard pickup. Talking about Howie Roseman before and the job he's done with Philadelphia, bringing these people in. It's kind of funny. I mean, he was a key man in that front office. There he is for a lot of years. And then when Chip Kelly came in for a while, Jeff Lurie gave all of the keys to Kelly, coaching player personnel. And Roseman sort of got shoved off into the background. And then when the shelf life ended with Chip, Howie came back. And as you mentioned before, candidate now for executive of the year. Second and four. And that is caught at the 40-yard line. Pass into the arms of Dallas Goddard for a first down. Again, a little bit surprised by the snap. You see his eyes. Boom, ball's there. And I think it may have affected his vision. He had a rail route down the right sideline to Stoll for a touchdown. Went to the inside. He got the completion. But the safety moved in with the big tight end, Goddard. And it opened up that rail route down that right sideline. Goddard. Five catches tonight. Blitz coming. Gets it away. Throws up his back foot. That's caught. And forward progress should net the first down for Goddard. But good patience here. He knows that the blitz is coming. A late blitz right here will end up getting to him. But he's just waiting for Goddard to clear. Waiting, waiting, and then that's a heck of a throw as he's falling back, baiting that linebacker to be able to get that in over the linebackers and in front of the safety. Smith and Brown exchanging strategy. Hurts, meanwhile, throwing, and nobody's open on that side. So pressure put on by Petrie on the blitz that time. And that will set up second and long. Lovey's rolled the dice a few times, and it's worked out. They've done a nice job there. You see Pep trying to go over the adjustments. But a good job of getting Jalen Hurts off of his spot, which is a tough thing to do. Think about where this offense was, how it's been executing in recent weeks. I mean, you're talking about as good as anybody as far as efficiency in the quarterback play from Hurts, but between the pressure from Hughes off the edge and mixing up some looks, they've done a very, very good job here. Blitz again. Gets it away. Goddard again. Big night for him. And he picks up 10 there. So Goddard, his number one target tonight, he's been thrown to eight times caught seven for 97 yards and they'll go no huddle. Great job by Steichen sensing that pressure again and Kelsey leading the way there. A little ghost motion from Watkins Sanders and they're just shredding him to the seven yard line looking a little bit like what Tennessee did last week. much easier read on green than what he's dealt with with Hughes. This is an easy one. Stays wide. Hand it off. Look at that hole. That's pretty simple for Jalen Hurts. This time, Sanders to the three-yard line. And Sanders closing in on 100. That's 98 yards on 15 carries for him. Love to go to the left side and don't exclude Jason Kelsey when they go that way. Watch the center kind of get out there, and then he just doesn't give up when a play's rooting down, helmet down. He's looking for anybody. Ironically, the back gets right in behind him. Eagles averaging about six yards per rush tonight. 120. Got behind the coverage and big play. 27-yard game there. Seven more here. Pierce stopped by. Hassan Redick, second and three. Block running down five minutes to go in the fourth. Texans picking up the pace. Mills outside. Snagged there, 21-yard line. And that's Jalen Camp for a time. He's been targeted tonight. And a first down. Big body into the boundary. 6'2", 220. And he's matched up there. Man-to-man coverage. What you like is he worked himself back to the ball against James Bradbury. Got to the top of his route. Instead of sitting, comes back to his quarterback and gives him a chance. Continue to be impressed with these guys. Moore, Camp, Dorsett. Over 300 yards of offense tonight for this team. The 19-yard line. Two here. Pierce stopped by Edwards. So Pierce tonight has carried 27 times for 139 yards. Continues to make a case as the offensive rookie of the year with what he's been able to do. O.J. Howard comes into the game. See you, Brevin Jordan and O.J. Howard both lined up on the right side. A couple tight ends. under four on the clock look out escapes for the moment to the 15 he goes finally taken down there and a third down coming up and about four how about Hargrave I mean if you're a Philadelphia fan are you kidding me with this guy I mean the last two weeks he just can somehow make himself skinny, believe it or not, and get through these gaps. Nice job of just pushing Mills, and Jordan was clear. He had it. Safety moved to the offense's right, opened up perfectly for Brevin Jordan in a touchdown on the seam route. Third and four, Mills, and that's incomplete. But a flag is thrown, so let's see who it's on. Burkhead with Kizer White. That's the matchup. Running back against the linebacker. Pass interference. Defense. Number 23. The ball is placed on the spot. All the foul. Automatic. First out. Davis-Mill is showing a lot of courage sitting in that pocket with it closing in on him. And you get this matchup with Burkhead. Good route. White beaten on the play. And then just almost tackles Burkhead on the out release. All right, 3-0-3 now. Looking down the stretch here. All of their timeouts, plus the two-minute warning. But as we said before, that two-point conversion makes it a two-touchdown. Trailing situation for them. No field goal. Field goal doesn't do any good here. Over the middle. Incomplete. Redick is back there. And it's Jordan Aikens trying to get it into him. Thought he would be a bigger part of tonight's game, but he hasn't been. How about Redick? I mean, we know about him rushing the quarterback these last three years, but he's going back to his old days when he's with the Cardinals when he has an ability to be a linebacker. It looked like he got his left hand on that football. He did. What a play. Can rush the quarterback. This time has to drop and stay with a tight end. It makes a tremendous play in space. Second and ten. Look out. 22-yard line. Number 97. What a night for Hargrave. What a night. This isn't fair. He's been having his way with Green, and now he goes up against the center who's going to come down. Quezen Bear, watch this. He tries to come down. He's beaten right off the ball. He's so quick with that first step for a 300-pound guy. It's over. It's the worst nightmare for any quarterback. We saw it last week in Tampa with Brady. That interior pressure, there's just nothing you can do when you get beat in the inside like that. Three sacks at career high. It's third and 19. Mills fires. Picked off inside the floor. Bradbury flag is down as he brings it back to the 25-yard line. Where did the flag come in? Illegal shift. Offense, number four. Early. Door set. Decline. Eight seconds to the two-minute warning. And that's where he was the intended target. Good job by Bradbury. The poorly thrown ball. He just has his eyes locked in. That's one thing about this Philadelphia defense. They do a good job in the red zone of everybody having their eyes on the quarterback. Even when they're a man, their peripheral vision on the quarterback, that's why they've come up with so many turnovers on the year. They lead the entire league coming into tonight with 16 takeaways. Now they've got a couple more tonight. And plus 15 on that give-take ratio, which is gigantic halfway through the season. And to the outside, and that will take us down to the two-minute warning and does. And we can tell you that after the game, stay around for the Google Pixel postgame show exclusively. See, that last game, that matchup, I think it was on Monday night with Baltimore and New Orleans. You see both Bateman out with a surgery, and now you've got Michael Thomas, who I haven't seen in a while. Right. He's now on the IR. Ravens, of course, picking up Roquan Smith from Chicago. And the pass to the outside goes to A.J. Brown. And the Texans have all of their timeouts, so if they can hold them, might get it back, but still you're looking at having to get two touchdowns. Anyway, the Texans playing a lot better than almost anybody thought, especially coming off that terrible outing against Tennessee last week. You look at Mills and you see the interceptions, and I think everybody the rest of the year is going to be watching him and evaluating, to your point earlier, with the draft coming up in the spring, what will this organization do? Do they feel like they'll have seen enough by the end of this year to say, you know, he's our guy, let's use those resources in other areas we can build around him. Or in a very NFL-friendly draft with quarterbacks, you've got a lot. C.J. Stroud's going to be a top pick. Will Levis at Kentucky is a guy that a lot of people feel could have a good year, a very good NFL career. Hendon Hooker's having a monster year. Bryce Young is, to me, an interesting prospect. And then Anthony Richardson with the physical skill sets. There's a lot of quarterbacks coming out this year. Pass is caught, and Goddard makes the grab, and he gets shoved out of bounds with 147. Then a flag. Inelible man downfield. Offense for the 68. It's a five-yard penalty. Replay, third down. It's Jordan Marlotta. A little yawn. Eagles first team. Positive differential each of the first eight games since the 72 Steelers. Beginning of that great run with four Super Bowls during that decade. Jonathan Gannon, who I know you mentioned how he was looked at here last year. A lot of people feel he'll be a head coach potentially even next year. with the year this team's having and the year this defense is having. Impressive personality, too. Here's Hurts. And gets a little extra after that. Looking good on the stat sheet. Ball came out for the moment, but he's gotten back as Kelsey helped to lead the convoy. Looks like Christian Harris ripped it out. The rookie got behind Hurts and ripped it out. And, of course, there's our guy hustling downfield. Yeah. Look at him. Ball? I'm on it. I'm everywhere. I would love to know when he played when he was in Little League and middle school. I mean, he's got fullback linebacker written all over him. Was a linebacker at Cincinnati. But I'm just, when he's younger, he had to carry. He's an athletic guy. His brother, of course, one of the elite athletes in the league. But, man, Jason, for a center, what a great skill set he has. So it's fourth down and one. And the Eagles. Let's see what they have in mind here. It's fourth and one.
