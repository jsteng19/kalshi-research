 In the pocket, puts it down, puts his shoulder down, and is about two yards shy of the first down, tackled by Lattimore, third down and two. He's been throwing these kind of check downs, these underneath throws, and this time he's looking from his left, 14, Portland Suck, who's working across against zone. He almost threw it, but did probably the right thing in holding on to that, and always trust his athletic ability because of how close he comes to getting first downs with his feet. So he sets up a third and short. He had 61 rushing yards last Sunday. He already has 31 tonight on five carries. Third and one. Off the fake. Ton of time. All day, all night. Rolling, but the coverage is very good and the pass is short. But he gave. Tipped it. So it's going to be fourth down and one. He did the hard part here. I mean, the coverage was good. Again, they're sitting back here. This time they bracket 84. That time Humphrey. Vele is trying to work out into that kind of a delayed reaction on that third and short. But did everything right. And then he just misses the open receiver. Going forward on fourth and one. Trying to draw him offside. Well, you can look at it this way. It's going to be a very low-scoring game. So you think maybe you'll go for it on fourth and one. Maybe you'll take a look and take the time out here. I'm with you. I mean, points tonight, if you get a chance to get in the field goal range, the way Denver's defense is going to play tonight against Rappler. You take the three points. It doesn't auger well for the over, by the way. We knew that coming in, though. Will Lutz. No love lost, as you can tell. On fourth down, 32-yard attempt. right down Canal Street. And that'll make it Denver 6. And New Orleans nothing. Fifth round when he's picked number 150. And, of course, you've covered him a lot. Yeah, that picture of him with that left thumb pointing to his, it looks like, to his back, to the name plate on the back there. I think it's pointing to his shoulder, the chip on his shoulder that he has entering the NFL, not just because of the draft, but because of what happened to him at Oklahoma when Caleb Williams took over, and he had to leave to go to South Carolina. Jackson takes it a couple of yards deep in the end zone and brings it back out to the 30, the rookie out of Idaho. Not short on confidence. No. I mean, he is a guy that, despite what he's been through, believes he is destined to be a starter, a franchise quarterback, and he's getting an opportunity with Derek Carr down here for a few games. And he's got the physical ability. He's not the tallest guy, but he gets out on the edge. He's athletic. He's got a big arm, can make all the throws. Just obviously, like any rookie quarterback, needs reps, needs to learn. This week, everybody talking about him is middle name minus will be Moxie. High snap, drops it, in trouble, runs into his own man, then loses the ball, and it's picked up again by Cody Barton. Touchdown. So Cody Barton has taken it into the end zone after forcing it. Meanwhile, we've got a little conference going on right now with the officials. I think Denver's D.J. Jones was offside, so it'll negate this play for Denver. Another turnover opportunity. Defense in the 93. Five-yard penalty. Go first down. Right over the center, Connor McGovern, and a huge break for the rookie. So instead of a touchdown, meanwhile, Barton's all over the place tonight. Fall out to the 35-yard line, and a first and five. Keep in mind what he's working with. Eric McCoy, who's an outstanding center, is out. He's on the IR. The backup Shane Lemieux is out. Basically a guy, Connor McGovern, who they signed 13 days ago. From the Jets practice squad is the starting center. And again, this time they whistle it dead. Stop the play. It's Browning. Offside. That's a slow developing play and a little moon ball, but they get the first down. Yeah, a gutsy call here by Clint Kubiak. He lined him up off the ball as an H-back. He floats that up and over top of Zach Allen. and luckily the defense is fooled on that fourth and short. Nobody left back home. You see he goes up in the air, able to secure that and obviously pick up the first down. That's the guy, Juwan Johnson, they think can make plays tonight. Rolling, throwing, caught along the sideline. Alvin Kamara makes the grab there. Kamara in his eighth season, longest tenure with one team among the running backs. That's only the fourth touch that he's had. I really thought coming in tonight, if they were going to move the ball, 41, whether it's catching the ball to the backfield or running, they've got to get him on track. And I'm sure Clint Kubiak, as the play caller, looking down, figuring out different ways to try to get this rhythm going with all these injuries up front with his rookie quarterback. Second and four. Toss here. And running into a brick wall at the 50-yard line is Kamara. That time he's taken down by Jordan Jackson. He'll be third and two. You know, you look at Clint Kubiak. I can't help but think. His father, of course, was the coach of the Denver Broncos when they won Super Bowl 50. Yeah. Gary lasted one more year and then stepped away. And his son, Clint, I think has a huge future, obviously, in this business. was at San Francisco last year with Kyle Shanahan as their passing game coordinator. Now gets his shot here in New Orleans. And the call he sends in on the third and two is play action. Avoiding the sack. Getting away. Deep into Denver territory. And Rattler is out of bounds at the 20-yard line. Baron Browning almost had him. Couldn't secure him. And off he goes for 28. And Browning, they bring five. They bring everybody up, play man-to-man coverage. It's a good job of feeling this by Rattler and then climbing the pocket. A couple guys he's able to get away from. And once he got away from the initial surge, there's just nobody left because of the man-to-man coverage. And this time he is looking to run once he gets out of there and has the speed to get some very valuable yards. Derek Carr likes to see that. Right now, Denver. Denver now takes your time out. 3.09. Two more seconds back on the clock. Thank you. Well, looking at our schedule down the line here, we talked about the Jets game on Halloween against Houston. And then a busy November for us. We're going to get the Ravens and the Bengals. We're going to see Jaden Daniels, Washington, and Philly on Black Friday. The day after Thanksgiving, the Raiders go to Kansas City. Our one Kansas City game this season will be on Friday. The kickoff will be at 3 Eastern time. Watch the game. Do your shopping. Get everything done at once. Keep eating. Keep eating, right? Leftovers. Black Friday. so after the timeout 3-0-9 Williams is the running back take it to him give it to Kamara around the corner he goes but nowhere as coming up is Jaquan McMillan to make the tackle loss of 7 without Sertan Levi Wallace has had to step up and these defenders they're playing with a great deal of confidence, I think, this year in this scheme with Vance Joseph. Tonight, like I said, this is a team that plays a ton of man-to-man when Sertan is out there. But I think the combination of Sertan being out, Vance Joseph deciding against the rookie quarterback, play more zone. Second and 17. Caught, 22-yard line. That's Mason Tipton making the grab, and Riley Moss making the tackle. Third down and 11 for New Orleans. And the reason that's important, it allows you to keep your eyes on the quarterback. And you can disguise a lot better and make him get a pre-snap look. And in the ball snap, you can go to another look to try to create hesitation and confusion. So Denver will take another timeout on defense. 227. Gives us a chance to look at the standings, right now. Neutral run, defense number five. A five-yard penalty results in a first down. Well, that's one way to get a first down. That's right. Two offsides. Kaylee. Guys, so according to tight end Foster Morrow, Spencer Rattler throws a faster ball and from a different arm angle than Derek Carr. Morrow described it as more of a baseball-style throw, and on Sunday, some of the Saints receivers had a hard time adjusting to that difference. So this week, they turned up the speed on the jugs machine before practice every day and tried to get better adjusted to Rattler style. Whatever it takes. Whatever it takes, Kaylee. Especially without your full complement of receivers. Rattler going deep downfield. Receiver falls down. Mason Tipton. Crowd wants a flag. Tipton looks for a flag. There is none. Riley Moss with the coverage on the play. It'll be second down and ten. Looked like he just lost his balance. Dennis Allen thinks that he was pushed there by the corner Moss. That's an undrafted way. Grabbed the hand for sure. But I think he just loses his balance after that. But he wants the... Oh, okay. Terry, good catch with a feed entanglement. 21 steps on his foot there to take him down. So second down and ten. That pass is caught for a gain of four. Jawan Johnson, a wide receiver in college, now a tight end. And Cody Barton makes that tackle. Third down and six. Terry, if you don't mind clarifying for people, if you have feet entanglement, the defender's not playing the ball. If he's feet entanglement, not playing the ball, it is a foul for defensive pass interference. If he is playing the ball, it is not a foul for defensive pass interference. our expert has spoken I'm buying it totally third and five Rattler pump fake then throws throws that out of bounds so they pick up a first down on two penalties you got Zach Allen putting the pressure on Rattler that time so Rattler is starting the game four for seven for 54 yards and another punt one of the more underrated players in the NFL is Zach Allen He's really having a great year this year. 6'5", 285. You can see that he has good quickness. Not the most gifted guy. You know, he spent some time with J.J. Watt in Phoenix early in his career. Really, I think he picked up some great technique on how to become a great pass rusher. Definitely using that at this stage of his career in Denver. With Matthew Hayball. Sent to Skyward. Fielded at the 13-yard line by Mims. and he goes nowhere. Coverage is very good by Rico Payton, rookie out of Pittsburgh, and will return in 30 seconds. So as of right now, the Denver Broncos have had the ball almost 13 minutes to less than five for the Saints, and they got the ball again, starting the strike from their own 14-yard line. 6-0. Broncos trying to get above 500 and the Saints trying to snap a four-game losing streak. Big toss, rolling, looking, keeping to the 18. Now Bo Nix right now has probably gone over to the sidelines, seen some of these throws, and, you know, he's probably his biggest critic. And this is an area he's going to get much, much better. His mind is moving fast, so his feet are moving fast. And he's missing open targets. Here it is when it's primary. He doesn't have time to think about it. Look how much cleaner it is. Look at the balance in his throw. Look at the accuracy in that throw right there. And, again, that's what he's striving for, the consistency of the footwork being better, his eyes and feet aligned. And then that's when his ball ends up being a perfectly thrown football. Second and six. Through the middle. Big hole. Exploiting it. And tackled from behind up at the 38-yard line goes Javante Williams. They've had four different rushers done it, including Nix, who's carried the ball six times. That's a gain of 20 right there. You have the tight end that's going to come over and help pick up. Watch the center get up to the linebacker. This play just opens up nicely. I cannot say it enough. We've not seen this from Denver much at all this year. It's taking a lot of the heavy lifting off of Bo Nix and these receivers, and it's allowing them to eventually get some play action pass go, and like I said, checking the ball down. instead of having to force the ball downfield. 88 yards already on the ground. And the rookie estimate on Notre Dame. He takes the handoff and fights his way out past the 40 where he's tackled by John Ridgway. Second down. He'll get inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Saints tonight. There's Dennis Allen. Look at those guys. You've got the starting quarterback, the two top receivers, the jack of all trades in Hill, the best lineman, Ruiz, and Pete Werner, a starter. There is Derek Carr. You know, it's funny, every team has injuries, but Joe Buck had a great line doing a game recently where he said, Hey, cry me a river, the other team is basically saying, right? The other team has its problems, too. Meanwhile, there's Sean Payton. A look at his regular season record. Most wins by a head coach in Saints history. Of course, he won Super Bowl XLIV, trailing at the half, and that onside kick, which turned the game around on a rainy night in Miami against the Colts. Saints have won the toss. They will defer. So Denver will start on offense. You've got Blake Groupie kicking off from the 35-yard line. You've got Marvin Mims and Tramon Smith back to receive for the Saints. Pat Kaus at the Superdome getting ready to celebrate its 50th year next season. And this kick will wind up in the zone that enables a run back from Marvin Mims. He'll come to the near sideline and get taken out of bounds up at about the 35-yard line. So, here is the number six overall pick in the draft. And the number 12 pick was the sixth quarterback pick. And there are his numbers on the season. He only had one touchdown in the first four games. four in the last two, so he's five and five in that department. And, of course, you had a lot of opportunity to cover him in college, both at Auburn and at Oregon. Yeah, he really dreamed his whole life. His dad played at Auburn, dreamed his whole life of playing there and hit some adversity, ends up at Oregon, had two great years in Eugene and first-round pick this year for Denver. Played 61 college games, a ton of experience before he got here, and he's going to take off as everybody is covered, and there he goes out to the 50-yard line. So he can run. There's no question about that. He's proven that over the course of the season to this point. 14-yard gain here. Yeah, I mean, that's something for a team that is struggling to tackle in space. They better be ready for Sean Payton to tell his quarterback tonight, Bo Nix, who is a great athlete, that, hey, it's not there. That primary's not there. His instinct at this stage of his career is a takeoff anyway. But that one opened wide open there in that second level. Linebacker's cleared out. They're going to line up Marvin Mims in the backfield. Fake it to him. Rolling, throwing, caught. Minimal gain at Annie. Troy Franklin, who was his teammate at Oregon, rookie from Eugene. A little wrinkle there here early in this game from Denver. You know, for the most part, this is an offense not only with a rookie quarterback, But tonight I think you'll see a couple rookie receivers, Devon Valet and Troy Franklin, to go along with Cortland Sutton. Sutton, really their primary go-to, not only receiver, but playmaker. And that time, just a way to get men's to football. They're trying to change looks up. Javante Williams, their primary running back, out of the pistol. Take it to him. Nix is going to keep it, and Nix is going to get the first down. behind a block from Michael Burton, who's been doing that for a long time, 10th year in the league. And a Rutgers came over from Kansas City last year. Yeah, the edge of this defense, they're going to have to be aware tonight of Bo Nix with his ability to pull it down. 20 coming left to right as Burton, as you mentioned, Alan, picks up a nice block and allows him to get to that first down marker. So a couple plays here early, Bo Nix giving an idea of what he can do with his legs. Tremendous athlete. Usually it's sprinkle in a run or two, but normally it's ability to create in the pass game by buying some time and extending plays and throwing the ball. So Rattler waiting his turn. A little razzle dazzle here. And he finds the open man, but can't hit him. Wide open was Lucas Kroll, who would be the number three tight end. Wide, wide open, overthrows him second and ten. He does a great job on this levels concept of just waiting for him to clear. But what happens is as the play rolls, you'll see his feet. This is the biggest concern you have with him. Step up. Watch his feet. Off balance. Not able to get his feet secured underneath him. Step up is fine. Now get your feet under you and make an accurate throw. He's a really accurate passer the last two years in Oregon. But throwing the ball so far his rookie year downfield, he's not done a great job with his accuracy. He also had Franklin open deeper. Second down and 10. Rolls against the grain. Throws against the grain. And that's incomplete. A long seven there for Marvin Mims Jr. Second year out of Oklahoma. It will be second down and three. I've got to tell you, in the world that we live in in college football with NIL and transfer portal, I think these NFL coaches and GMs, they really find it refreshing when a guy goes through some stuff, gets through it, and then is able to survive, and now he's been through some adversity. He's been through tough times, and I think that's very attractive. It was to Sean Payton and to Denver. He was their guy. Second down and three. They hand the ball off this time to Audrick Estame, and he'll take it out to the 33-yard line. He'd be their number three running game. They're just looking for somebody to pick up a good yardage anyway because the running game has been fairly nonexistent. Exactly right. At the time he was very patient, I watched him play at Notre Dame. He is a powerful back. And with Javante Williams still working his way back from that knee from a couple years ago, they're hoping that Estime with more carries can be that thumper back there in that backfield. So his first down, going to bring in Jaleel McLaughlin. Another of their running backs. Stake at the hand throw. Slant. Caught. And into Saints territory goes Vele. Rookie out of Utah. Picked him in the seventh round. He looks good. 6'5". He has sent. Yeah. Got great hands. Great catch radius. And look at Bo Nix. Like when his feet are set. Look how accurate of a thrower he is. If primary is open and everything is clean. Zip right on the money. And I think that's why the coaches are so excited about his potential and what he can become. It's just working through his progression. in keeping that rhythm that he has when primaries open. Williams back in as the running back after the 20-yard game. Play action. And in the pass, it'll be caught at the 50-yard line. A little behind Franklin, who picks up a couple of yards on that play. Houghton makes the stop. It'll be second and eight. Sure, Denver looking at some of their self-scouting. They have attacked through the air a lot of times to the left because Cortland Sutton a lot of times lines up to the left. And if you look at their targets on a passing kind of a diagram, you'll see a lot of throws here early. They've been throwing a lot of balls to the middle and off to the right. Sutton eventually will get involved up at the top. They'll move him around. Put Burton in a pullback. He'll help lead the way. Williams breaking tackles. and he picks up a first down getting to the 35-yard line. And they go with that big fullback there, Burton. Nice job of leading the way on that isolation block. And it's good to see Javante Williams run hard like that. Going no huddle, pick up the pace early in the game. Great protection, fired, caught, 30-yard line. And taken down there is Javante Williams, and that will make it second down at about five. There's one guy you don't have to worry about tackling is Demario Davis. The rest of this defense last week missed 18 tackles against Tampa Bay. 33 over the last two weeks, by far the most in the NFL. Take everything away downfield just to check down. They get positive yards. They're on first and ten, a big part. When you have rookie quarterbacks stay on schedule, avoid those third and longs, especially for Denver. Third down has been really, really bad this year. Second and fourth. The back is McLaughlin. He takes the toss and gets smothered. After the orgy comes in to break up that play, and it'll be third and sixth. He had five defensive linemen in, so it's tough to work those double teams and get up to the linebacker. See all those defensive linemen in there? That's great because look at the double teams. They can't quite get up there as a good effort, but it keeps the linebacker free. And he's able to get downhill in a hurry, and that's a nice tackle for a loss there for the Saints defense. Third and six. Spread it out. Go five wide for them to the right side. Nix looks that way and throws. No, he still has it. And Knicks on the move, breaking away that time from Chase Young. And out of bounds inside the 30-yard line. So fourth and three. Not only is he fast, he's powerful. Yeah. Great job there just keeping that play alive. Almost had enough speed to turn that corner again for that first down mark. But at least he keeps him in field goal range. This will be a 46-yard attempt for Will Lutz. who was picked up last year. Of course, he was with Sean Payton here for seven years in New Orleans. So in three of them, Lutz now for the extra point. And with 7.30 remaining in the opening half, the Denver Broncos trying to get to above .500, leading the Saints 13 to nothing. So linebacker Blitz is here. It's picked up by the center. Watch the right guard with a kickout block. There's just nobody left. You know, that's about as easy as it can be once the center is able to pick up that blitzing linebacker, Demario Davis. That opened up, and Denver right now over 100 yards rushing. Yeah, 102 on the ground, and the Saints with nine rushing yards. Dennis Allen has that look again of a team that right now started out on fire. Knocked off Carolina in the opener. Everybody said, okay, big deal. But then when they took care of Dallas. Yeah, 2-0. Derek Carr's looking great. Clint Kubiak was like, wow, what a hire. Of course, I think we all think he still is. And then the injuries really started to stack up. And losing Derek Carr. Had that lead against Philadelphia and lost at the end. Yeah. Had the lead against Atlanta. It did. Coos field goal from downtown. Knocked him out of that one. Meanwhile, it's juggled by Jackson, who's going to run it back. Looking for a spot to get through the middle of that coverage unit. To the 20-yard line, he goes with J.L. Skinner making that tackle. Dennis Allen spent 12 years with Sean Payton on the staff. Two different tenures. In between, he was the head coach of the Oakland Raiders for two full seasons and then four games and a third. And Derek Carr came in when he was a rookie. Allen was still there. But now he came back to Sean. Got the job when Sean leaves. Trying to get this team turned around. Six-yard game for Kamara there. Second down, second and five. when they won it all in 2009 against the Indianapolis Colts. So they stayed in-house when Sean decided to step away from football, albeit only for a year. Allen gets the job. His team now with the second down and fourth. And Williams gets to the 28-yard line, third down. One of the things we talked about, and how you win if you're on the road, you've got a team that's got a lot of injuries, and you're Denver. You want to make this quarterback have to work a long field. I mean, tonight they have started deep in their own field position, you know, a lot of times around their own 20. So Vance Joseph, who, by the way, went to high school in this area, so, you know, he's fired up to be back home and having a chance to bring in one of the NFL's top defenses. They're playing very well tonight, very sound all year. Here's a third and three. Pressure. Getting away. Keeping his eyes downfield. Going to get the first down. He's bumped out short of it by Barton, who's having a heck of a night. See, they're playing zone, so their eyes are on the quarterback. You see a difference with these two rookie quarterbacks. When Bo Nix looks to run, he's looking to get to a corner and take off to get to that first down. Mark Rattler, he's got some athletic, but he steps up and then out. Watch his left hand. He's trying to throw. He's not thinking about trying to run to get that first down and didn't have another receiver other than the one that was down deep. So good hustle by Denver there. And by the way, 55, Cody Barton all over the field. Meanwhile, fourth and inches. Saints are going to take a timeout. I mean, if you're New Orleans and you're having trouble on offense, you've got the rookie. And, of course, the crowd wants you to go for it, as they always do on fourth. Good luck if you don't make it here. well we're approaching the halfway mark of the season yeah a lot of things stand out to you name one right now in the NFL overall how about the moves with the Jets it's been kind of a soap opera there with everything that's been going on the latest Devontae Adams coming over from Las Vegas you knew he was going to get moved a lot of people assumed he would probably end up with Aaron they lose a tough game but then break the good news that Devontae Adams is coming there. Even Buffalo making moves with Amari Cooper coming over to try to help them out on the perimeter. Speaking of the Jets, they're in Pittsburgh on Sunday night. Then we get them at home against Houston on Halloween night. Meanwhile, now they've got a lineup to go for it. And they do. And it's floated and caught. And they get a break by getting the first down. And Jawan Johnson is there. 55-yard line. Time. Matthews saved a touchdown. A gain of 21. And a great opening drive in progress for the Broncos. A little eye candy with emotion. It's just a toss crack to be able to get, you know, your more talented playmaker in space out there again. And there's McClenchie with a nice pickup on Granderson and some room to run for another Denver running back. and Sean Payton has got to be so happy with what he's seen from this offensive line tonight. Great opening. Second half drive for the Broncos from the 25-yard line to the outside, and then coming back inside, and finally they corral them. Javante Williams next to nothing. It'll be second down. Let's go second and nine-half. Regino won. They've been running the ball down the entire field. Now I sure Bo Nix is going to have to make a play here It the Saints 20th in the league against the run and tonight they already given up more than their average 150 23 carries you're talking about over five yards per tote second and nine what's coming hangs in there gets the blocking needs and caught at 20 yard line Troy Franklin making it the third down and five so the Broncos of course they had the Russell Wilson situation over two years and one of the most one-sided trades ever as it turned out and then knew they had to go into the draft, could have traded up, but they waited, and they still had a guy they wanted as the number 12 pick. Yeah, and I think that Jaden Tanyas is, I think, a guy everybody wanted, but I think Bo Nix fits Sean Payton and what he wants to do and how he wants to grow this offense. Third down and five. Lofting one into the corner of the end zone, and incomplete. Coverage was very good by Taylor. Little Jordan Humphrey, the intended receiver, fourth down, and in comes the field goal group again. Man, that was a great job by Taylor. Watch him work through traffic in this bunch formation. He's got to be able to work around one of his own players, and then he does a good job of getting his eyes turned back to the football. Once he felt Humphrey look back for the ball, he did a good job of getting his own eyes turned back. He was able to locate it and knock it away. Textbook, 38-yard attempt for Lutz. Who is three for three. And he's now four for four. Makes it 19-3. Drew Brees paying us a visit. Sean Payton and Drew Brees hooking up together. Drew's going to join us in the booth after he was inducted into the Saints Hall of Fame. Family out there at halftime. Meanwhile, this drive will start from the 30-yard line. Here he is. I'm reading about you in the paper today. You're opening up a pickleball facility. How is retirement treating you? Life after football, you know. If you can't play football anymore, you've got to pick up the pickleball paddle. No, it's good. It's a lot of family time coaching high school football and Pop Warner. Got to give a shout-out to the SFC Eagles and LCC Pop Warner. We're down the stretch here in the playoffs. So, honestly, that's filling a lot of my time. Oh, that's great. Your team will meet Andrew Whitworth's team at some particular point. I hope so. For the California title. We want to strive beginning from the 30-yard line and start with Kendra Miller. You know, I think about when you signed here. I mean, you were San Diego. You have the surgery. And then you have a choice. I think Miami turned you down because of the shoulder. New Orleans. The city was decimated. You got a new coach. You don't even know if he can play in this building. Tell me what happened at that point. What are you thinking about? Well, I'll tell you what happened is Sean Payton got lost during our visit, and he showed us things that he wasn't supposed to show us, which was all the devastation. And, in fact, it had the reverse effect, though. It actually made my wife realize that this was about so much more than just football. It was about being part of the resurrection of one of America's greatest cities. It was a calling. No question about that. There's Cameram making the grab, but tackled there. That's what I want to ask you just about when you come back, and I know you come back a bunch with your family. It's not just about football. What does this region mean to you because of the success that you had on the football field and what it meant to this city and the way, like you said, it revitalized this city? But this region, this city, this community, this fan base, it shaped us all. All the guys that were part of this journey and building the foundation of this team during the Sean Payton era from 06 until we all retired. Level bouncing off of would-be tacklers. So it's been a big, huge emphasis. In a short week, it's tough. They showed a lot of video. They showed some good, some bad, just to try to motivate them, get them ready for tonight. That's 60 yards per game. Yeah. Both the missed tackles. And that's out there able to stop them. Close to a first down. Adebo makes a stop on Williams. We go to Kaylee. Guys, the Saints have owned the fact that tackling is a problem. Demario Davis, who breaks down the pregame huddle every week, told me there are no motivational tactics needed at this point. Everyone has a sense of urgency, and he believes solving the problem is more mental than anything. They can execute, but David said it comes down to having a high level of focus and finding a way to be consistent. Davis has been consistent in his career. 200th game for him. Third down in inches now, and a quarterback sneak here as Nix keeps it and takes it to the 44-yard line with a little over two minutes to play in the opening quarter. Denver on top, 3-0. To me, tackling, I mean, you're a professional. I mean, you've been tackling your whole life. It's really about communication, and it's almost like rebounding in basketball. You know, when you see it consistently becoming an issue, and I thought Dennis Allen hit the head. He talked about angles, talked about leverage, and he talked about technique. You know, a lot of times they're there and they hit. They just don't wrap up. And so, again, I think we've been pretty clear. It's been emphasized and see how they respond tonight. Williams and McLaughlin both in the backfield. And the ball is handed off. And taking it to the 37-yard line is Javante Williams. It's to see Mike McClinchy back in the lineup. Had a knee. He's been out for the last four weeks. He's now back at that right tackle spot with a nice block there. And I'll tell you, if you're a Denver fan and you're watching this, you're thinking, that's more like it. They've not been able to run the football to take some of the pressure off of Bo Nix. But there again on first and ten, positive yards. And getting Javante Williams running downhill, which is something we've not seen a lot this year. They've already run it nine times for 52 yards on the ground. On second down and three. Close to a first down is Williams. Stop there by Houghton. Take a look at the sticks. And the officials will signal a first down. seeing Sean Payton right now. I loved how he said, I don't have that joker. When I was in New Orleans, we had a joker. We had Reggie Bush or Darren Sproles in the backfield. We had Jeremy Shockey. We had Jimmy Graham. What he means by joker is a guy that can win in the pass game, win one-on-one against the linebackers. They don't have that, so he's had to do it different ways with this young offense, mixing up personnel groupings, sometimes one tight end, sometimes two. Just a lot of different books. Waning seconds of the quarter. Pass comes to the outside incomplete. Flag is thrown. So, we will hear from our referee, Mr. Land Clark, for the first time tonight. Starting pass. Holding. Defense number 29. Five-yard penalty with an automatic first down. That has not stopped the pressures. Adebo. So, I mean, he was probably drawing more flags than any defensive back in the league this year. Yeah, and with Marshawn Lattimore on the other side, it's not a shock that people go at him. I think what gets maybe overlooked, because he has three interceptions, and people are like, wow, what a big year he's having. But a lot of PIs, a lot of defensive holdings when people attack 29. and escapes it throws caught slanting over the middle Troy Franklin signals a first down and that's going to signal us to take a break at the end of the first quarter end of one in New Orleans on this Thursday night it is Denver through the third quarter so second quarter starts for the first down at the 17-yard line for the Denver Broncos on top 3-0. Toss it here. Williams. A little bit of a crease. They've completely taken over the time of possession here. They have had the ball for 11 and a half minutes to a little less than four for the Saints. What a change from last week against the Chargers when the Chargers kept converting third downs. And I think they had the ball over 37 minutes in that football game. So a big change. The biggest change I see is they're winning the line of scrimmage. You know, they're running the football, which is putting Bo Nix in a favorable position with those check down passes, short passing that. Hang on a second at six. And if you can start to mix in Estime with Williams, who's off to a really good start tonight, and then that change of pace back is McLaughlin. It's a nice trio that they have back there. Remember, they're looking for playmakers. Somebody besides Portland Sutton with Josh Reynolds down on the IR with the surgery to his finger. Sutton has not even been targeted to this point. Second and six. Play action. Screen. Nice block there. There goes Williams. First down. Gets up to the 50-yard line. Ben Powers threw a nice block, 74. The guard. Sean Payton offense, you're always going to be thinking about the screen game. The guard here, 74, who you talked about, Ben Powers, nice job of not selling it too early, then gets a nice block there on the edge. And there's Javante Williams showing that jump cut at his size, 220-pounder, cutting back inside and picking up that first down. We saw a Devo coming in. He needs a moment right there to the sideline. he will eventually go down for the moment. Key injury, Paulson, Adebo, starting corner on the other side of Lattimore. Those three picks. Been with his team since 2021. Always the worst side of the football game. We're going to bring the card out and take him back to the locker room and they'll take it from there. So the Saints just decimated on both sides of the ball. Yeah, Adebo with those, you see the three interceptions, leads the NFL defending 10 passes. All right, back to the locker room on the cart. And any time we don't want to replay something for you, you know it's serious. So just hope for the best for Paulson Adebo. Meanwhile, you've got Kool-Aid McKinstry coming in to replace him. Elante Taylor will play in the nickel. And its first and tennis play resumes from the 50-yard line for Bo Nix. To the outside, he goes. The open man, he finds him. Down the sideline goes Franklin. Knocked out of bounds by McKinsey. So they go right to the guy who just came into the game. Yeah, this is a slow-developing levels concept where the two play-side receivers, they're just clearing it out. And the backside right there is Franklin, who eventually comes clear. And that's what you're used to seeing from Bo Nix in his college days at Oregon. Out on the edge, ability to make that throw at 20 yards. Nice job of adjusting by his college teammate, Franklin, for the big game. Burton, the fullback. Williams, the running back. Williams. To the 18-yard line, minimal gain. Taylor makes the stop. Down to Kaylee. Guys, you saw that rather large splint that was put on Paul Sinedivo's right leg? That's called a vacuum splint. Typically, when those are used, there's concern for the stability of the bone, not just the ligament. And that cart took him through the tunnel and straight to the x-ray rim. Yeah, I'll bet. Oh, boy. And again, the injury is just piling up for that guy on this team. D-W-A got McKinstry, a rookie out of Alabama who's very good friends with Nicks who went to Auburn at one point before Oregon second down and eight, that pass is caught for a first down and then spun around with forward progress to Lil Jordan Humphrey, tackled there by Taylor It's incredible, when the receivers are in tighter coverage The ball is thrown right on the money. When he's got open receivers, it's where he's struggled tonight with his footwork and his accuracy. But they do get the first down. Keep in mind, both these defenses in the red zone, they're 1-2. Denver leads the NFL in red zone defense, and the Saints are number two. So you're going to have to earn it tonight once you get down in especially the low area here. Very much so. First and goal. Halfway through the second quarter. Nope. Wide. So much to happen. And yet, Javante Williams for the touchdown. Goes in untouched. So they complete that drive. Eight plays, five on the ground. Eight-yard touchdown here. Took 444, and they're up by two scores. You see this one open up. Boy, that was... It's not about tackling on this one. It was about just gap responsibility. Well, Denver talking about starting faster at least because in the six games prior to tonight, they've been shut out in the first half. Remember Lutz? They give him a lusty welcome. And the countless Cowboys coached by Bill Parcells, who was one of Sean's mentors. And the Saints won 42-17 on a Sunday night. Boy, that was a special year in so many different ways. Absolutely. Post-Katrina. This town decimated by Katrina in August of 05. Me way, you got Peyton and Nix. Ferris, don't let me go. Tough love all year long. This is Jermaine Jackson from the goal line. Up to the 33. So, I know, I mean, remember this town was a wreck. And the Saints had to play all of their games on the road. They were in San Antonio. I think they were in Baton Rouge, Shreveport preseason. And they come back in, and Peyton takes the job, and they get Breeze, and that turned everything around. Yeah, incredible in his first year to be able to have that moment in this building after everything this region had been through. It was almost like a rebirth for so many people, not just football fans. They rallied around this football team. And I think he and Drew Breeze are kind of symbolic of that year and that run that they had. It was therapeutic for the fans. Yeah. Alvin Kamara will be taken out after a short game. You know, he's downplayed it all week, and rightfully so. I mean, he's, you know, when you get into a team sport, it is focused on execution. You said business trip, and it's about winning a football game. But at the end of the day, after all that he went through here, it's not just about football. I think it's a lot to do with what he meant to this city. Sure. that pregame gang talking about he showed up five hours early. He actually went to a luncheon honoring Drew Brees today at noon. Meanwhile, breaking the tackle, still on his feet, up to the 40-yard line goes Kendrick Miller, who they have activated, brought up last week, but was inactive. And it'll be third and two. So, Sean, of course, then he leaves here. He was still under contract, and they had to make a trade, in effect, to get him to Denver. And, of course, Sean spent a year at Fox Sports, worked a lot with Carissa Thompson on her show. But, boy, he missed looking at that scoreboard at the end of the night. Meanwhile, the catch is made here by Bub Means, a rookie out of Pittsburgh, drafted him in the fifth round. I mean, imagine Clint Kubiak trying to put this game plan together. You talked about everything that they're missing. Playing a rookie quarterback. Shahid down. Olave down. Here, third down and short. Go with a bunch formation. Condensed. And just Denver doesn't pick up. Bub Means, he's able to clear free there. Made a really easy read to Rattler. Look out. He gets hit. Was the arm coming forward? Haven't heard a whistle. Yet, meanwhile, Cody Barton coming in. But they're going to rule that. Well, they're going to rule that a fumble and a recovery. Juan Alexander, they just activated him in his 10th year in the league last year in Pittsburgh. So they're going to contend that it was a fumble. The arm apparently not coming forward. We'll take a look, obviously, and see what the replay shows up. Watch how Barton disguises this. Remember, this is what Tampa did last week. They dialed up the pressure. Nobody picks him up with all those new offensive linemen up there. It's their 23rd sack on the year. They're second in the NFL, so it's been a real strength of theirs. And Terry McCauley clarifies that that is, in fact, is a fumble. He got to him before the hand came forward. So Denver football, big turnover. So Barton is in his first year at Denver. Alexander, on the right, has played for six teams now. on Rattler with the fumble. So, playing with a little bit of fire, because Barton almost had a pick earlier. He did. And creates the fumble here, the forced fumble. And Denver takes over at midfield at their 45-yard line. We talked in the open, how do you win the game if you're Denver with a rookie quarterback that's been good, and then at times been a rookie. You lean on that defense, and you get short fields, and that's what they've been able to do, see if they can capitalize on this opportunity. Hangs in the pocket, throws, caught, 49-yard line, Lucas Kroll. We've talked a lot here tonight about the tackling or lack thereof for New Orleans. Let's take a look at our next-gen stats, powered by AWS. You can see entering tonight, 370 yards allowed after missed tackles. By far the most in the NFL. We've seen some moments tonight where Javante Williams got into that second. We experienced some incredible things together, but we were made better men, better leaders, better players as a result of being a part of this. Got a flag here. What was the third down and 11? What do you think so far of your rookie quarterback here, Rattler? Look, he's an exciting player. He can do a lot of things. I love what we do in the run game with Clint Kubiak, and I think it really fits his strengths well because it gets him on the move. It sets up a ton of our play action, where I think that's when he's at his best. That penalty's declined. Fourth down. By the way, what was that first game like in 06 when they came back? That first home game. For people that aren't from this region. Yeah. We watched it. What was that like? I can visualize it right now. The best vantage point here. September 25, 2006. Steve Gleason blocking the punt right there. Right as we're saying. I hope it doesn't happen to us right here. But it was the shot heard around the world. That was one of the most incredible moments. The most incredible moment in Saints history. Four point off the foot of Haywon. And that, as I recall, Paul stopped at the 31-yard line. That happened very early in the game, like a minute and a half into the game, right? And this place just exploded. I've never heard the dome that loud. Really? Part of some incredible moments here. I have never heard the dome that loud because it just meant that much more to so many people. People were trying to rebuild their homes, rebuild their lives, And somehow, some way, they had figured out a way to buy season tickets to support their team. And so we didn't feel that as pressure. We just felt that as a great sense of responsibility. Every time we stepped on this field, we represented our city, our community. And we knew that we could lift their spirits and help with this process by winning football games for them. You and Sean, a match made in football heaven. So they honor you at a luncheon today, and Sean shows up, right? In all of his Broncos gear. in his Broncos hoodie, along with a couple of our other coaches. I mean, 75% of their sideline I played with or had some interaction with over the years. Crowley, tight end, makes the catch. He's had a nice night. They're going to run up to the line. He's part of the day. Gail Benson is right there. Jimmy Graham. Jimmy Graham, yeah. One of our greatest teammates ever. And, of course, he had to lead the crowd. and remember the way you used to get you. I'll never forget, we did a production meeting once. I said, what does your wife think about when you're doing this? And she said, I don't even know you. You kind of go to a different place when you're down there. You know, there's this feeling of invincibility. But I remember when that all started back in 2007 season. It was, you know, we felt like something was lacking, something needed to be done to create that energy and excitement pregame and give us that confidence. I want to ask you about, for the Denver fans, Bo Nix is a rookie. He's playing for Sean Payton. There are a lot of us, myself included, watching him before he got to play for Sean. Looked at his physical ability. I'm going back to old Drew Brees at Purdue with Joe Tiller. He reminded me a lot of you as far as his approach to the game, his athletic ability, and his approach and how he's a no-nonsense guy. Have you watched him much? Your thoughts on him and his system with Sean? I've watched him a lot. I think there's a ton of experience, obviously, coming from college, a ton of intangibles. I see him doing a lot of things at the line of scrimmage, which I know Sean requires in the quarterback position. I think where Bo is at his best when he's on the perimeter. I think where he can take growing leaps and bounds is just throwing from the pocket. Being able to get the ball out on time, being able to avoid pressure, and also I think just the way that compliments play action. If he could just be under center a bit more and learn to turn his back to the defense, that will set up so much more with their offense in the passing. Go back to your rookie year when you're younger. For the fans watching two rookie quarterbacks, just the speed of the game and how different it is this year for Bowe compared to year three, year four, and year five. Very different. This is what the guy gives you here. There he is. He gives you on a third and one. He sets up a first and goal. He looked like Taysom Hill. Yeah. With that run. And what's great is you can use the formation to go to the field and then they're a man short back the other way. Yeah. This is the stuff that a guy like him with his athleticism and the ability to get on the perimeter, he can give you that most guys can't. But, again, the game will steadily slow down for him, especially just as it pertains to the drop-back passing game. And, look, they don't have a ton of playmakers outside, in my opinion. Nobody that can really stretch the field for them. But they do have some big targets. so they can just get completion, complement the run game. It will set up so much more for him. So a hill first and goal. 75 rushing yards for Knicks tonight. Gives it to Williams, and he burrows his way in for the touchdown. So the Denver Broncos far sideline intended that time for Franklin. It will be third down and ten. Yeah, he had Franklin pulling away from his defender, Elante Taylor. He had him open. and he also had the option if you want to just pull it. He had broken, contained. Probably could have gotten another big run for a first down with the speed that he has once he got outside. This time they spread it out. Bunched three receivers to the left. Bring Williams back into the backfield. Proud as it always does. Roaring at full throat. Play clock at two. and on the third and ten a deep deep drop and tries to set up something over the middle and that's incomplete because of the pressure put on by the Saints. So two quick first downs followed by a punt now. Taylor came late. Really good job of disguising this pressure and then he came late. They show pressure originally from the right coming here and then when the ball snapped the pressure comes from the other side and they were able to get enough pressure on him. You can see how open the tight end is Troutman The pressure affected Nicks, who, again, wasn't able to get those feet settled and get that ball out quicker when it easily had a first down. Rodney Dixon is earning his keep. More punch than any kicker in the league, averaging six per game, which tells you the problem they've had on third down. Fair catch is called for made by Jermaine Jackson at the seven. So we'll take a look at the good list here. Meanwhile, Rattler throws it open at the 30-yard line, making the catch, taking it to the 40-yard line. for tomorrow. So what a start for the rookie who made his first NFL start last week. How about that? They come out right away and find the big tight end. Moreau, who does a good job in line and getting out to that corner route. Nobody picks him up there. This is a man-to-man team, but you've got to feel with a young quarterback who doesn't have a lot of reps, you'll see a combination of some man and some more, even more zone tonight. Now you've got Kamara picking up a yard, maybe two. So here's Rattler, who was a high school phenom at one time. One of the front runners for the Heisman, but a different story. We'll get to that in college. You can take a look at what he did last week. They were down 17-0. He led them to 27 points in the second quarter. Then they were outscored 27-0. I think there's Derek Carr on the right in the second half and got blown out. by Tampa Bay. Second and nine. Gets out of the pocket. Avoids the sack. Fires deep downfield. Is lucky that wasn't picked off. Cody Barton had his hands on it. Could not secure it. John Franklin Myers put the pressure on forcing Rattler out of the pocket. It'll be third and nine. Yeah, but Barton will end up leaving your stream. But this gives you an idea I just talked about. This is a man-to-man team. But with Patrick Sertand down, They're going to play more zone and make this quarterback have to make decisions. Sometimes with a young quarterback, you think you want to dial up that pressure. Play man-to-man. It's a lot easier. Zone, he's got to work through his progressions, and he caught a break that time. That was right into the hands and through the hands of the linebacker in great position, Cody Barton. Third and nine. In the pocket. Fires, and that will be taken in at the 47-yard line, about two yards shy of the first half by Cedric Wilson. tackled there by Jaquan McMillan is how he likes to pronounce fourth down. It's going to be that kind of game, right? We've got a couple rookie quarterbacks, especially with Rattler who's only played, he was inactive the first five weeks and he plays last week. Well, it looks like it might be that type of game, but every time we think it'll be that type of game, it turns out to be something else. Hunter is Matthew Hayball, a rookie, with a kicker out of Vanderbilt. He'll bang that one inside the five and bounds into the end zone. So Nick comes back out. Take a look at his timeline here. Hinson Valley High School in Alabama. Dad, a legendary high school coach at Auburn there, freshman of the year in 2019. And then he goes west. He goes to Oregon, offensive player of the year. In the Pac-12 last year. 12th overall pick. They picked six quarterbacks in the first 12, and then none in the next 138 picks until they got to Rattler, of all things. It was top-heavy last year in the draft. And, you know, that story with Bo Nix, I talked about it. He grew up, his dad played quarterback at Auburn, grew up his whole life wanting to play there, and it imploded on him after three years. He ended up leaving and turned his career around. Swings it out here to the outside. and again of about the first five weeks of the season played last week and now here he is on a short week with a lot of injuries on his offensive line trying to figure things out that's a tough thing to do saints will take it the 30 yard line moments ago kaylee with dennis allen well dennis tackling was a big point of emphasis this week how do you feel your defense did through one half well we were better tackling but we still got we still got a lot of things that we got to fix and got it correct. You know, unfortunately, we gave up the three points there and the two-point or in the two-minute drive. But really, the biggest thing's been the quarterback. The quarterback's been able to run and get out and scramble. What was your message to your quarterback during the half? Listen, just go out and keep playing. You know, he's done some good things. You know, we've got to make some plays around him, too. All right, thanks. All right, Kaylee, thank you. Meanwhile, it's dropped. Got to make some plays, and that's no way to start. Cedric Wilson dropping it second down. Yeah, it's definitely worth mentioning that Spencer Rattler is making his second career start. You've got your two best receivers out of the lineup. Your starting center, who's outstanding, Aaron McCoy, is on the IR. The right guard is out. The left guard is out. Taysom Hill is out. And you're trying to put together some continuity. That's, I guess, one of the better defenses in the league. He swings it out to Camaro, picks up about four. You're still number three. Your shot there, that's Jake Hainer, who would be the backup quarterback right now. There he is. So let me ask you, what do you do? Do you put Hainer in at some point in this game? I mean, you've got a rookie. You've got Rattler doing his thing. There's, of course, Derek Carr on the left. There's Taysom Hill on the left. I think what you do is you've got to stick with this guy because he's mobile. he is athletic enough, much more than Jake Hayner, to be able to get away from some of this pressure that this offensive line is creating More pressure again He fires this one and again it dropped right there Coverage was good but Jawan Johnson had a catchable throw there and it's fourth down and seven. Well, Mathis is back. It's good to see that. He had an ankle to keep him out of the lineup, and this is who they want. I mean, they're looking for playmakers with the top two receivers down. He may get away with a little hold there on that jersey on that right shoulder, But that's a ball with his size, Jawan Johnson. He'd love to see him work back to the ball and make that catch. But it's like the right hand of Mathis got through there and knocked it out. So they start the second half with a 39-second three and out. And Hayball's kick fielded at the 22-yard line. Mims. Decent run back out to the 34. Well, I think the first half, the most positive thing for Bo Nix and for Denver is the fact they've got to push. Look at these holes. This has not been what we have seen at all from Denver. It's allowing Javante Williams and Estame, when he's been in there, to be able to get into that second and third level. Look at this offensive line. McClinchy is back at right tackle. Miner's the right guard. Forsythe is a backup center. Doing a heck of a job here opening up some holes and not making Bo Nix like last week, feeling like they could not run the ball as well and put a lot on Bo Nix in the passing game. Tonight, that's not been the case, at least in the first half. Start on the ground here. Another good run by Williams. Brian Brazee, he's in the backfield. I mean, you're just talking about Denver, what a good job they're doing with their offensive line. But Brazis right there. That's a two-yard loss. But instead, it's a missed tackle, and it's Javante Williams with some tough running. We just showed you a package on how they've been opening holes, and he's been running through into that second level. On this one, it was the opposite. On this one, they got penetration, and he was able to shake it. The rookie, Audrick Estame, is the running back. First down play here. Give it to him. And nice little run here to the 46-yard line. They're chewing him up on the ground here. That's 121 rushing yards. Not to get into the minutiae as far as .7 yards before contact, but let me just tell you this. They're near the bottom coming into tonight on penetration and allowing defenses to be able to slow their running backs down before they can get started. And tonight, they have done a much better job of creating some holes in that to me. By the way, that's minutia 2.0. Here's McLaughlin. Look at this. McLaughlin. And they finally stop him at the 20. Good protection. Open. But first out right to midfield goes Lucas Kroll. The tight end. So the clock running. Conserving that last time out. A little over a minute remaining in the half. Watch the start up front. Great communication by that offensive line to pick that up and give Bo Nix enough time there on that third down. Stays in the pocket. But then has to throw it away and grabs it. Will it be a flag there? You had Demario Davis. Javante Williams was right there threw it right at his feet he got lost to the shuffle with all those linemen there but he was right there Lance Florenton announcing the grab receiver in the area no grounding he's right there in the middle of the screen just throws it right at his feet second down and ten from the 49 It's usually where they like to get Cortland Sutton ball down at the bottom Just thinking the same thing, haven't even targeted him tonight Pressure, throwing And almost Pick over the 34-yard line Right into the hands of Ty Matthew, who's no stranger To interceptions Jonathan Abram Came in on the blitz that time And Matthew He was 35 picks. Yeah. And number 36. Yeah. Was easy. Yeah, Bo Nix, it's like he threw between two receivers. The crossing receiver and Sutton downfield. He threw it right in between them. Almost a fair catch there for Tyron Matthew. And it's the last guy on the field you'd think would drop a short interception. Absolutely. Almost too easy. Third and ten. Nix buying time. Throws. caught, and again a broken tackle here, and Mims is able to get that extra yardage and pick up the first down. That's what I talked about with that last pass, would he show confidence in his young quarterback just because the potential of a pass that could cost him points, and yet he comes right back with the next call after that poor decision by Bo Nix. He comes right back to show, again, confidence in him to look downfield. He comes down, checks it down, and by breaking that tackle, picks up that first down. Broncos running their 38th play. Saints have run only 21. Pressure coming. Exposed. A little bit short and incomplete. Marvin Mims is there. That was a great throw, considering he anticipated that because of the pressure. He had to get the ball out well before Mims was even thinking of turning back and coming back to the football. So the fact he got enough on that, that ball's easily catchable. But, you know, the Saints had dialed up the pressure here on this drive, and that time he was forced to throw it a little bit early, but got enough on it. Second and ten. Knicks going to run it so Knicks has now carried the ball seven times I mean it's great to have a running quarterback they take a time out here but how much do you want your quarterback really running that time because of the screen that was set up to throw to the right there to Marvin Mims it was picked up right away by Carl Granderson so he did the smart thing. Watch Granderson sniff this out right away. He just says, wait a second, something's going on. So he's right there with the receiver. He takes him away, so Bo Nix is forced there. With men downfield, he's forced to just run it, try to get something positive out of it. They used that last time out. Called the 37, so if you don't gain another yard, you'd be looking at a 55-yard field goal attempt again. The Saints will get the ball when we start the second half. 105 rushing yards. You get 59 for Williams, 38 for Nix. Third down has been a nightmare for this offense this year. They're 31st in the league, but tonight, pretty good. Yeah, three out of six. They move Sutton now from the left where he normally is. Now all the way to the top of your screen to the right against the rookie. Number 14. Third and seven. Knicks. They take off again in two divisions in play tonight. In the AFC West, of course, the Chiefs are unbeaten. Chargers at 3-2. The Broncos come in 3-3. In the south, they've got the Falcons and the Bucs, both 4-2. And the Saints trying to hang in there. The 2-4 right now. And I think, you look at that race on the left there. I think for Denver, it's about trusting this defense. I mean, they're top five defense in the entire league. And over time, Bo Nix and his offense will keep getting better and better. Third and 11. Pressure caught. Trying to break away and gets a couple of more yards for Samoro to the 17-yard line, but well shy of the first down. And that's going to take us, ladies and gentlemen, to the two-minute warning. 13-0. The Broncos on top on Thursday night football. Fitching at the whole gang. They're out still painting the town red as they do every week. But I know. Well, there they come. Richard Sherman. We're done it. Ah! Everybody working on about 28 minutes sleep, but then we're with you at halftime. Ah! 28! Well, all right, 33. State Farm halftime show coming your way next. Well, Drew Brees is going to be put into the Hall of Fame. Meanwhile, at fourth down and five, for a moment they left the offense out there, but that would kind of be stunning. Blake Groupie who was so good last year they traded Lutz sent him to Denver so this will be a 35 yard attempt snap good, hold good kick likewise on the board 13-3 Denver and we go to Kaylee It's time for just for kicks. Absolutely. Nothing like an X or a Z. Hard to have. I'm trying to think of what a guy's name would be. You'd have to just have an initial as a first name. And the three letters in the second. I can't think of any. This is what we do in our production meetings. We try to figure these things out. By the way, there's Davis Webb, the quarterback coach. He was talking to the quarterbacks on the field before the game. They've talked about how much he's made a difference in that room just because he can relate. Being a former player, just got out of the game recently and already a quarterback coach in the NFL. So I'm sure he's got a bright future in this business as well. By the way, first time the Broncos have had 100 yards rushing and 100 net passing in a first half since 2020, four years ago. Here's a run back from Mims. Took it a yard. Into the end zone. Brings it back out to the 28-yard line with 152. And one timeout remaining for Denver. It's been an obviously productive first half for Bo Nix in this offense up 13-3. Let's see what Sean Payton decides to do here with his young quarterback. See what kind of confidence he has in him. If he's secure with his 10-point lead or if he's going to trust him to keep attacking here with that one timeout. from the 28 they begin this drive Knicks 102 yards through the air and also 35 on the ground swings one out here again a missed tackle and then a gain of about 6 or so for Javante Williams people forget Javante Williams when he was coming out of North Carolina what kind of future a lot of people thought he could have in the NFL and then had a really bad injury. Came back from it last year. Wasn't quite the same. And to be honest, I think this is the best he's looked since that injury as far as a half is concerned. Block running down to a minute and a half. Saints will get the ball to start the second half. And on second and two, fired over the middle and into a lot of traffic and up to the 46-yard line. Vele and lost it. So that will make it third down and two. Could not hold on. Good looking rookie, though, out of Utah. Talked about him. Looking for his first career. He had eight receptions, do Vele, in the opener. Then he was inactive. He was hurt. Came back with four more last week. Third and two. Scoots out of bounds. A little bit shy. And they're going to send in the field goal unit now with 21 seconds and no timeouts remaining. So he gets some positive yards there on that scramble. Gets out of bounds so you don't have to hurry it up here to take this field goal. So at least he gets them into field goal range. Meanwhile, a 52-yard attempt has become almost a chip shot these days. Pickers 50-59 are hitting three quarters of their attempts. And here's another one. Dialed in back home in New Orleans. 52-yard field goal is good. He has three field goals tonight. And it's 16-3. We're back in a half a minute. So the rookie from Oregon. 13-21 for 134. 41 ground yards as well. They've had the ball almost two-thirds of the first half. Controlling the pace, controlling the tempo, and have run twice as many plays. Touchback. You know, this defense from Denver has lived up to the billing. You know, they're top five in a lot of categories. It's kind of a no-name defense. You probably don't know a lot of these players, but, man, they play well as a unit. Came in tonight understanding the purpose going up against this rookie quarterback, a beat-up offensive line, relying on that front to get home and be able to get that pressure without having to blitz, even though they are a blitz team. They're second in the entire NFL as far as blitz and pressure and sacks, but they've been relying on that front and allowing that second and third level to keep their eyes on the quarterback. The pass over the middle. That goes nowhere. Kamara. Tackled by McMillan. Wants to make sure we emphasize the Mac. Not McMillan. Take a timeout here. 11 seconds. You try to get in a field goal range. Maybe try to get a a PI. Think about this. You're Spencer Rattler and you're excited to step in for Derek Carr and get an opportunity. In your first career start, you go up against Todd Bowles and the way they can get creative with their blitz package. Drew Brees will be honored here in a little bit here at halftime. And then his second game, he's going up against Vance Joseph in this defense. That's his introduction to the NFL. Two of the best. We're going to have Drew come up and join us for a segment of two in the booth in the third quarter. Meanwhile, under pressure. And that's the way this half is going to end in all likelihood. But they're going to take another time out, I guess. Alright. For what practical purpose? You tell me. I don't know. Even you're stuffed. To stump you is hard. You're excited for what's going on behind this wall right here at halftime. You hungry? It depends. I've got to see what the spread is tonight. Are we going Cajun or Creole? It's a great town for food. Sure. Punt, fumble, punt, field goal for the Saints. Will you take a timeout? It's the only timeout I've ever seen, and a kneel down follows. And they'll get food off. Yeah, whatever. I know. Well, 16-3 is our halftime score. Meanwhile, in the last 60 minutes of play, the Saints have scored three points. Second half, last week, first half. Tonight, Broncos on top by 13. And we go to Kaylee. Rashawn, four scoring drives, only one touchdown. How do you assess Bonet? Well, look, you know, I think we're running it well. Bo's moving well. So I hate settling for field goals like that. And I think in the second half, that's the first thing we're going to talk about offensively. No targets for Cortland Sutton. What have the Saints done to take him away? I think we're getting a lot more zone. And so they're trying to keep their eyes on the cue. And I think when you're in man, sometimes he can scramble more. So a lot more zone coverage tonight than we've seen. Thanks, John. Yep, thank you. All right, thank you, Kaylee. So, halftime coming up to the State Farm. Halftime report, Carissa and the gang. I think we're a stage team that's going to get the ball to start the second. You know, when you have rookie quarterbacks, obviously, the game is still moving really fast for these guys, and especially in Rattler's case where, you know, he's been in. Needed 10 yards. And have the opportunity to secure possession again. Denver called a timeout just to keep you honest. Right. I want to make sure we use our full allotment complete in the fourth quarter. Well, we still have one remaining. Yeah, yeah. You want to use it there? Yep. I don't think so. We'll see. Well, Dennis Allen, he's a man very much is going to take some heat, obviously. You lose five in a row, and every coach is going to take some heat. You know, and I don't think people, you know, he's not going to ever say injuries. We can say it for him. Yep. But people, they just see, wow, 2-0. What's happened in the last five? What's going on? Anybody that is being fair, you know, again, I'm not making excuses for him. I'm just saying you lose your starting quarterback, your top two receivers, two of your best offensive linemen, Taysom Hill. Injuries are starting to stack up on the defensive side. I mean, it's really tough to maintain a certain level when you have that many injuries. Meanwhile, Shahid is out for the season. They have surgery in L.A. today. He's their number two. Olave's concussion last week. So here comes the attempted onside kick, which will be secured by the Denver Broncos. P.J. Locke locks it up. What a word master I am, right? What have you been doing so long? Yes. What did you end up? You added it up in a break. 31 games. Yeah, 31 games with Manimal Kelly Hayes, George Hill, my guys. Yeah. What was the first year you came in here? You're not going to. I actually did a game here in 1975. I did a game late in the season with Hank Sram on CBS. And we were going to have dinner the night before the game. And he said, I can't because the owner of the team, John Mecham, wants to have dinner with me. and I said he's going to try to hire you. Oh, yeah. And he did. And then Hank came here after Hank got fired by Kansas City, and he's working one year for CBS, and he comes here and he coaches the Saints. For a couple years? Yep. Then got back into broadcasting. Oh, yeah, did a great job with Jack Buck on Monday Night Football Radio. Meanwhile, Jared Stidham comes in. He's the backup to Knicks, and he can wrap it up with one kneel down, and the Broncos will have a happy flight home. Well, all the talk and all the fuss about Sean Payton coming back, it was cool that he went this afternoon to celebrate Drew Brees. Those two will be connected forever in this town and for football fans. And he was able to get to win. And so mission accomplished, able to pay tribute and also bring his team, as you said, onto a business trip back into New Orleans, get to W33-10 and onward, get ready for that next one. And that takes us to the 42nd mark, which means no more play is necessary. So Sean Payton comes back 15 years as the Saints head coach. Comes over with his man, Dennis Allen, who was his assistant for 12 years. Two different tenures. Mike Westhoff also coming over to shake his hand as well. and the Denver Broncos are above 500 at 4-3. Bo Nix, good night for him. 165 yards in the air and 75 on the ground as the Broncos win it by a score of 33-10. And that will wrap up our portion with the State Broncos. 69 yards 5 plays 4 of them on the ground and the Bronco faithful are happy on the road what we've seen throughout this game is Denver's ability to control the line of scrimmage it's not been something that's necessarily been a strength but I'll tell you what, today it has been great job of just push look at the push up front there McGlinchey back from that injury And, again, if you're a Denver fan out there, you've been wondering where is Javante Williams since the injury, you're seeing him tonight. Looks great. Lux for the extra point. Hey, Matt, great to see you, as always. Congratulations to see you. Congrats, big man. Keep it. Jim Moore kind of helped turn this franchise around. Everybody was wearing the bags until Moore got in. They had some good years. Yeah, really good years. Then some lean years again. And, of course, Sean came in, and you know the rest. 26-3. The Broncos on top. From the 4, running this one back. 2-20 goes Jermaine Jackson. Let's take a look at that. Oklahoma got off to a good start there. Then he winds up at South Carolina. Passes low. At one point, I mean, he's a Heisman candidate. He might be a number one draft pick. What happened? I think what happened is Caleb Williams emerged and became Caleb Williams. And eventually it took a guy that was, before that happened, he was a Heisman, like you said, frontrunner, and was getting booed off the field at his own stadium in college. And he ended up losing the job middle of the year. Caleb Williams went on to obviously have a good year, and he sat through that year. and then eventually after the season, he left, went to Columbia, South Carolina. Had two good years at South Carolina. I think the group there is, in this stage of portal, he stayed and dealt with it and grew. And I think now he gets into the NFL, and I think he's going to sit behind Derek Carr once Derek Carr is back, which I think is a good thing for him. But I think these reps, this experience is huge for his growth. Well, it's interesting. You talked about getting booed off the field at Oklahoma Nair's car. You know, in a way, you talk about Knicks at Auburn. That didn't end wonderfully. Very similar. I sat in our meeting this morning because of the way he grew up in the state of Alabama, and you're either Alabama or Auburn in that state. His dad was a great quarterback there and now a great high school football coach. This kid, from the time he was two years old, three years old, had nothing but Auburn jerseys on. He lived out a dream to go to Auburn to play quarterback. And after a 9-4 year, his first year, I think they were 6-5 or not great. And they booed him. And so he left without the Oregon. So both these guys had a similar pass as far as hitting some adversity, which, as I said earlier in the show, a lot of these NFL executives like to find quarterbacks that aren't perfect, that they have been through some stuff. because it's obviously going to be a bumpy road once you get up here into the NFL. That was Tipton making that catch. That's an 8-yard gain. Second down and 2. Rattler is 14-21. He's in the triple digits right now and a nice run here. Where Jamal Williams, back up to Kamara and a first down. Williams came over as a free agent after he had a 1,000-yard season as a Lion. And with Ken Trey Miller behind him, he's not getting a ton of carries, but got loose on that one. Also had 17 touchdowns with the Lions a couple of years back. And Ratner will slide to a stop. The flag thrown here. 350 remaining in the third. Broncos have things at this point well in hand. Offense number 87. Ten-yard penalty. Replay for Stout. Tight end. For us tomorrow, and we go to Kaley. Guys, add another injury for the Saints offensive line. Left guard Nick Saldaveri is out of the game with a shoulder injury. He was a backup, moved to starter because of other injuries. Now it's undrafted rookie Kyle Hergel in his spot. Yeah, we see him, right? Rookie out of Boston College. And that kind of night to the Saints to this point. First and 20. Now Landon Young, the right guard who is a backup. He's a tackle that they moved to guard to fill in for release. That's where they are. You've got to move Young. 20. And again, another good run on the ground for McLaughlin. This is a team right now that is approaching and has exceeded now 200 yards on the ground. 206. Yeah, and the offensive line deserves a ton of credit. Haven't allowed a sack all night, averaging over seven yards a carry. So Sean Payton thrilled with what he's seen by the big boys up front. End of three in New Orleans. The Broncos lead the Saints. 26. 10.30, about an hour here locally. Calling a local astronomer in a moment. Meanwhile, Rowling is next and throwing. Catch is made up at the 24-yard line by a little joint. Humphrey. And once more to Kaylee. Guys, if you can believe it, the injury bug just relentless on this same sideline. Arshon Lattimore, a cornerback after a quick visit to the medical tent, has been pulled out of this game because of a hamstring injury. He set out week two because of a hamstring injury as well. And an update on the other cornerback, Paul Snadibo. You saw him in that vacuum splint on his right leg leave the field on a cart. He went straight to the X room, then to the ambulance. Now he is at Oshner Medical Center about six miles from here. Oh, boy. Our best to him in his recovery. That was anything but a pretty sight when that happened. So they've lost both corners. We talked about all the guys that are missing on offense. Got three extra days to heal up for what it's worth against the Chargers. But meanwhile, you've got a fourth down here. First drive. This is their eighth drive of the night that has not been at one point in Saints territory. I know you say everybody's got injuries and they do. Nobody's been hit like the Saints this year. They've got some company, but they might be number one in the category you want to be number 32 in. Riley Dixon. Fair caught at the 24-yard line by Jermaine Jackson. A minute and a half into the fourth quarter in New Orleans. 26-3. Denton. Presented by Xfinity Internet. The guy that's been most reliable has been Javante Williams and his offensive line in the run game. They've been opening up holes that when he was able to break through an arm tackle of Brazil. Look at that hole right there. So he has had a great night. A couple touchdowns. First time in his career he's been able to get a couple scores. So a lot of talk about Bo Nix, but really to me it's been about Javante Williams and the offensive line in the run game tonight. Love to see that happen all year for this Denver offense. 12 carries for him, 81 yards. Pass here, caught by Tipton. Goes to a first down, run out by Levi Wallace. Think about this defense. and, you know, they're playing well tonight against the Saints offense. It's beat up. But keep in mind, Patrick Sertan is out with concussion protocol. He'll be back hopefully next game. This defense, outside of Sertan, you can't name a lot of them. But, man, they play well together as a unit. They have. Yeah, Vance Joseph's done a nice job. He was the head coach at Arizona for a couple of years at Denver. Actually, he was the head coach at Denver. Then he went to Arizona as the defensive coordinator. And then when Sean got the job, he brought him back. And he is a stud, and I think he's very confident with this group and who he has. Riley Moss is a corner on one side opposite of Sir Tam. We were talking about Van Joseph at the meeting today. What are the chances he might get another head coaching opportunity? He's kind of like had a lot of the same path that Raheem Morris had. Had been a head coach, became a D.C., and Raheem's got Atlanta playing very well right now. Pass to the outside That caught there by Bub Means Rookie makes his second grab And it really shows you the way this defense can mold and become something else Tonight they played predominantly zone. But because Sertan is out and because they're playing against this young quarterback, they completely changed the look. Playing way more zone, not blitzing, and relying on that. Here comes the sack here. That time it's Nick Benito. who comes flying in around the outside, and down he goes. Well, they walk up pressure and then bail at the last second to create a little confusion for the rookie left tackle. You could see he was hesitant. It's because they were walked up there and allowed Benito to go around him again. Benito now with five straight games with a sack. Tipton makes the catch here. Even the Broncos, they're going to try to ratchet it up now. going to win tonight. Carolina and Denver next week. But then. The schedule makers didn't do them any favor. August of 05. That surprise onside kick. Drew Brees takes over there. And the Saints win the Super Bowl. What a night. You know what I remember about that is Drew Brees' son, he's a little guy. Maybe one years old. One of the first times you ever saw the headphones just to try to protect him from the noise. Big Sports Illustrated cover story on Drew at that time. Second down and one. Painter steps up in the pocket and then lost a softball that is dropped by Kendrick Miller. Ton of drop passes tonight. Ton of missed tackles tonight. A lot of stuff to clean up. I think a lot of people thought with Hayner is to back up those first five weeks to Derek Carr that he might get an opportunity when Carr went down. Rattler, of course, went from being inactive to being the starter the last couple of games. A lot of it has to do with, I think he brings a little bit of juice to the offense, his personality, but also obviously the mobility moves around a lot better than Hayner. That's a first down. And more. And the 11-yard line goes Cedric Wilson. The thing you like about Hayner, though, is he sees it and he gets the ball out. And I think that would be, if he were going to state his case, why he should get the opportunity to throw. It's about, hey, let's spread defenses out. Let me find the matchup. And even if they pressure me, I'm not going to run around. I'm going to get the ball out. I think he just moves a little bit slower for him, sees it a little bit quicker, and right away has an answer to get the ball out of his hands and get a first down to Cedric Wilson. Well, they take a timeout here, which is music to the ears of some of our reprobate friends. I'm with you. I know you are. I know. We're very close here. Yes, we are. We have 33-3 is the score. How it started, how it's going, first two games. I mean, everybody's talking about, wow, how about them shades? Who did? Last five, yuck. From the 12. Fired, caught, touchdown, Cedric Wilson. I don't know about you, but it's that quick release, and they dialed up pressure in that red zone. Remember, this is the number one red zone defense in the NFL, and the ball has not gotten out like this all night. Now, he's in his second year, but look at all those white jerseys. Trying to create some confusion, make him hesitant. He sees it right away, man, and it is out of his hands, and it's accurate. A couple nice throws for number three. Extra point here by Goopy. Well, now you can say the game is officially over, even after a touchdown. I think so. Siggly felt it for a while. Got to keep an audience. What can I tell you? So, Sean Payton, look at this Mike Westhoff, the longtime special teams coach. And even Sean, you know, he's not a guy who wants to pour it on, but he doesn't like to give up a touchdown in that circumstance. So they bring Hainer in, and all he does is go three out of four for 38 yards. And it's good. And a touchdown. So let me, here we go. I mean, if Carr can't play in their next game, what do you do? You know what I'm, you know. Yeah. Yeah, I mean. Based on what we just saw? Yeah. How do you not? I mean, that's the best execution that we've seen all night. Yeah, that's a minute and 38 seconds, whatever it was. I think it was just how quickly he made the decisions and how the ball got out and how accurate the throws were. I think next game you might want to see him under center to see if he can keep that going. And their next game will be in L.A. against the Chargers a week from Sunday. And then they go to Charlotte to meet the Panthers. So they have declared for an onside kick, which you have to do these days. And the punter, Matthew Hayball, will try to kick at the... At Baltimore. And then at Kansas City, back-to-back. Right. That's tough. But if you look at the totality of the schedule, I mean, the AFC, you know, Kansas City's going to win that division more than likely. You can get to nine. You got a shot. Sure. You got a shot at that wild card. Yeah, nine and eight. Seven teams in each conference going in. And another sack here. So this night of misery in a way will continue. There's another sack here. This time, Zach Allen came over from Arizona. Right. SOS going out. Four sacks tonight for the Broncos. He is relentless. Plays with such a high motor. Great player. When the Broncos came into the game, second in the league in sacks. The 22, they're now 26. Hayball's gotten a workout tonight. This will be punt number six. Drifting, pulling four and making the fair catch at the 15-yard line. 10-34 left in regulation. Story of the night if you're a Saints fan right there. Tells you the job the offensive line has done. 114 yards after contact. Kind of expected that with some of the Saints tackling. And plus 40 rush yards, over-expected. All three of those are season highs. And the beneficiary, of course, is Bo Nix in this offense tonight. They racked up. Denver has 372 total yards. And that Saints defense, Porus again, shredded for almost 600 yards total last week. To the outside, getting around the corner. It's by Taylor and he'll chalk up another 15 or 16. Javante Williams. Well, you get outside like that. You always wonder if they had a hold on the edge there. There you go. And you did. Nate Atkins. So that Saints defense. That's Dennis Allen's pedigree. 51 points last week Only half of that tonight, but Almost 400 yards of offense Last week, 594 79 is reported as eligible 79 is eligible Meanwhile, Denver Tonight, you would think McCourtney Sutton Has not even been targeted You would think coming into the game To get a catch, he's not even looked at You would think they really would have needed him, and finally they were able to smother Williams in the backfield that time. Anthony Orji takes him down. Second down and 19. There was the jumbo look running an extra tackle and just a miscommunication in the interior. Made it easy for Orji to get in there. Denver has not gotten behind the sticks much tonight, you know, with penalties and miscues. It's been a pretty clean game. They wanted to run it, and they have done that indeed. 31 runs, only 25 pass plays. Knocked down at the line of scrimmage. It'll be third down and 19. You look at this team and who they have coming up. You mentioned Kansas City and Baltimore after that Carolina game. with the defense and the special teams that they play, I think Sean Payton's confident that they can be competitive in a lot of these games. Just a matter of can they continue to do this? Can they continue to gel and develop up front that continuity with that offensive line? There's a peek at what they have coming up. Javante Williams, can he stay healthy and run this football? And Bo Nix, you know he's just going to get better every single week with the reps he's going to get in this system. third and 19 draw play and after the 16 yard line goes Javante Williams as he hones in on 100 yards tonight 91 on the ground for him well Riley Dixon will come in been an off night for him he's averaging 6 punts a game this will only be his third kidding me before the game I said did you sign up for 6 punts a game no Well, that's what happens when you don't convert very often on third down. But tonight they have done enough of a job to keep them on the sideline. There's a tackle in there at guard. Watch him flinch just a bit there. That's all it takes. So it's first and 25. So a season that started so promisingly for the Saints. not coming off the rails. Those two blowout wins to get things started. Tight game with Philly. They lost it. Tight game with Atlanta. They lost it. And now on the verge of going down for the fifth consecutive game. Catch is made up at the 43 by Mason Tipton, a rookie out of Yale. That's the real Yale. Not Yale in town, by the way. Not the key company. Malibu Kelly hates finding this amusing by a lustrous spotter. On second and 18. That will take the ball to the 46th. And we get another flag. That's Cedric Wilson. Anytime you see a helmet on the ground, usually hands in the face on the offense. Illegal hands in the face. Very good. Someone's helmet came off. Looks like we just heard Kaylee talk about Kyle Hergel coming in, the undrafted rookie three agent out of Boston College. Man, he's just trying. He gets his hands up high on D.J. Jones. Actually, that's not D.J. That's Malcolm Roach, who's a former Saint. I think these Saints fans have seen enough. Not quite ready for the bags, though. No. Second and 28. And down he goes. And finally they get to him, John Franklin Myers gets the sack here. And again, taking advantage of Landon Young, the right guard right here, who's a tackle who's trying to fit in there to be a guard. Boy, I tell you, that's more about John Franklin Myers, who they brought over from the Jets in a trade, 6'4", 290. He and Malcolm Roach, who we just talked about, you add those two pieces with Zach Allen and DJ Jones, Such a different defense this year because of the push they're now getting in the middle to complement Cooper and Ellis and Benito and Barron Browning out on the edge. What's on your play sheet at 30-34? Well, a decent game in breaking tackles and taking it up to the 41-yard line goes Bub Means, rookie out of Pittsburgh, and like Rattler, he was drafted in the fifth round. They had a couple of choices in round five, and you just saw the connection between those two. So it's fourth down and 20. And you'll have Hayball coming in for his fifth punt of the night. Saints, meanwhile, may buy, of course, after a Thursday night game. They go to the Chargers, play in L.A. a week from Sunday, and then go to Carolina. Fair catch called for at the 16-yard line by Marvin Mims and a flag. Flag back at the line of scrimmage. Boy, since that second quarter last week against Tampa where they scored 27 points, since then they've been outscored 53-3. Second half last week and what we've seen here so far in these first three quarters. Well, you talk about a good teammate, and we talked to Rattler about Eric Carr. Kicking team number 48 is lined up in the backfield. Five-yard penalty will be at the end of the play. First down. It doesn't always happen. But with a guy like Carr, not surprised. That's who he is. Down the Mississippi. New Orleans. So, Knicks did a really good job tonight. 15-24. 161. 75 on the ground chased out flag passed along the sideline is taken in by Belay and we'll hear from Land Clark again Chavante Williams picked him up in pass throw there but he got a hold he's one of the better pass protection running backs in the league physical guy but he got caught there Offense number 33 10-yard penalty. Replayed. Pushed out. Indeed, Williams. And down we go once more to Kaylee. Guys, it's a big football weekend for the Knicks family. Bo's mom, Kristen, is here tonight. But dad, Patrick, is watching from home in Alabama because he coaches the reigning 7A state champ. Mom, Kristen. That's the proud of her boy. First and... 39-yard line. Jackson starts one way, goes the other. Forced out of bounds. There was Dixon in there. I mean, every time a kicker goes in, they're trying to make a tackle. The coach, I know with all due respect to my pal, Wayne Gretzky. Yeah. He's right there. He is right there. He's a draw play to Kamara. Meanwhile, we talk about Derek Karp with the oblique injury, missing his second straight game. I know he'd like to play next week. They're not sure of that, probably the following week. Of course, after his whole career was spent with the Raiders, comes over here, catches made here by Jawan Johnson, tackled there by Brandon Jones. Talked to him on the field before the game, and, you know, it's just every time at this point of his, just the rehab. Every time he tries to turn and throw, that throwing motion, he can feel it. And it's just a matter of continuing to double down in his rehab. He's doing everything he can to get back. Third down and five. And it's through the hands and incomplete of Bub Means covered on the play by Riley Moss. Fourth down. And they'll go with 7.31 on the clock in the fourth. Bags aren't out yet. No. I wonder if he came with that sign already ready-made. Yeah. I think it looked like it was already prepared. Yeah, very professional. He's anticipating misery. Yes. Bratler. He's in a little shovel dump to Alvin Kamara, and they turn the ball over on downs. 7.25 remaining. And we'll be back. I promise. Who will play the Raiders on Sunday against the Vikings, who play the Lions on Sunday. And they go into that game unbeaten. So we get a look at Sam Darnold, Matthew Stafford, of course, for the Rams. Now we go. Yes, we do. Now we go. Next week. Next week. Yep. Back in the saddle. In the saddle again. This is it. We fell off the horse tonight. Yeah, we did. That's a pretty good game. 26-3. The Broncos on top. This is payback. Yeah. And a 15-yard game carrying guys with him. Estime. Meanwhile, we have Bo Nix. He and Sean Payton on the sideline. Watch his eyes, Al. Yeah, look at him. Watch it. And what I love to Sean Pate when he talked to us he said you know that that's my love language. Yeah Meaning he he likes seeing his rookie quarterback Getting a little feisty there that was that the game after the game he said Ferris Bueller. I think that was it That was the game that he thought he Reminded him of Ferris Bueller on his day off. I never saw Ferris like that. No never Harris is pretty chill they lay listen to the first that flag is thrown get the call from land the Clark All right, Kaylee, what you got? Well, guys, Bo Nix has always wanted to be coached hard, and that's according to his dad, Patrick, who coached him to two high school state titles in Alabama. And Patrick Nix told me from the time Bo was four years old, whether he was playing T-ball or flag football, he was there to compete and win. And from Bo's first meeting with Sean Payton, Bo told us, He knew they would be a good fit. Patrick said that's because Bo needs somebody to be a little fiery with him because that's his personality. Absolutely. First and 15 now after that penalty. Threw up some of the clock here. And balls out, balls out, and the Saints have it. So Estame gives it up. Willie Gee, who came over from Kansas City, is a free agent. three covers. It was 6-10 remaining in the fourth. Yeah, there's the experience of a guy like Willie Gay who's in for Pete Werner from behind. Yeah, he got that ball out before he hit the surface. Just love to see guys still competing with this game well out of reach. It estimates a guy that's trying to get more carries, trying to prove as a young back that I think Sean Payton came out after last week's game saying, listen, we're not out here to redshirt these guys. This is the NFL talking about Franklin and Vele and Estame. With the night Javante Williams has had Estame gets a few carries, and that one he spits out. With five carries for him tonight. Meanwhile, the Saints now, who've had terrible field position all night, at least are on the other side of the 50 this time. Coverage is good. And down goes Kendrick Miller for a loss. I just feel like you watch NFL, you watch six, seven, eight games a week, whatever you're bouncing around watching. Denver is just sound. I mean, Vance Joseph, what he's got to love about this group is they're just in the right spot. They play well as a unit. Look at them. I mean, they leverage the football. There's two guys there. The defense definitely is. Barton has been everywhere tonight. Number 55. They picked him up from Washington. Sternad, 40. He's in for Alex Singleton. He's done a great job since he's been in there. Very productive. The guys on the edge are interchangeable. Third and nine. It passes caught at the 40-yard line. The tackle is made at least for the moment by Moss saving him first. Now Wilson makes the grab, will be fourth and two. And Moss is in his second year out of Iowa. I think a lot of people were surprised who was going to be the corner opposite of Sertan. And a bunch of different guys. As he's really emerged to become a tight corner on that side. And that will convert as Wilson makes that catch for a first down. Saints, in the last six quarters, again, shut out over the last two quarters last week. Taken out of the end zone so far tonight. With one field goal. Rattler stopped at the 34-yard line. Other thing they're able to do is they're able to rotate a lot of bodies, especially, as I said, on that edge with these linebackers, outside linebackers. Second and ten, look out. And is that going to be a fumble, which is taken by Barton in the air? There's no whistle yet. And Barton, what a night this guy's having. And Jaquan McMillan is the guy who hits Rattler as the ball is being released. And for the moment, rule the touchdown. It doesn't matter whether it's a fumble or an interception. He caught that in the air. McMillan came. They have not glitzed a ton. This time they dial it up. They brought both the linebacker, Sternad, and also McMillan. See him looping around. but this is where the pressure actually gets home. Nobody picks him up. Nobody sees him off that slot receiver. Goes as a 52-yard return off an interception. And Barton, meanwhile, a lot of people would like to see them go for two here, but they're going to settle for one. You know what I mean. Oh, yeah. Kick is good. and the score is now 33-3 what a night for 55 process that's the big time and Sean now in his second year there and run back here is Mason Tipton to the Broncos with a brand new facility It is Broncos Park. It's powered by Common Spirit. Great new training facility. Team headquarters in Englewood, Colorado. There it is. That's beautiful. Yeah, it's fantastic. Great football town. They obviously love the Broncos. They're starving for them to get back to being a postseason team and making a run. That's a franchise that has been to eight Super Bowls. You forget that. And they won three, of course, with Elway back-to-back. And then winning Super Bowl 50 with that great defense. And Vaughn Miller is the MVP. And nice run here. Gain a 16 for Tendray Miller. Yeah, you go back to the Orange Crush days back in the 70s. Yeah, well, here we go. Right after Drew. Well, we had Drew in the booth tonight. Meanwhile, the injured Bronco. Hold off on that for the moment. It's interesting. I mean, the Broncos with Sean. Mike Shanahan was there for 14 years, one of those two Super Bowls. John Elway riding off into the Rocky Mountain sunset. And since then, they've been through eight or nine head coaches, right? Incredible. Maybe they finally found their man. And Sean, remember he was out for a year. There he is. Went into television, but he missed the scoreboard. He said, I got to know win, lose, whatever. You don't know that on television. Yeah, we asked him. As we know. Yeah, exactly. We know that tonight. But I found it interesting that he was out one year and that he was able to find an opportunity. You know, that he said, you know, when I'd be in there and we were done and I just missed that. Like you said, the practice, the competitive spirit that he has. He's still got a lot in him. I think he feels he can lead this franchise back to that Super Bowl that you're talking about. That was Damari Mathis who walked off under his own power of the injured. He just got back tonight. Hopefully he'll be all right. Ball at the 37-yard line. Keep it on the ground. Nice run here for Miller. kind of a slasher kid out of TCU. In a second year, he's battled through some injuries. Kind of like repetitive comment, it seems like, about the Saints. But, man, when he's healthy, he can go. Second and one. That's fired and incomplete. Johnson could not hold on. So third down and one. Again, the Broncos, you know, we can have Carolina. Then at Baltimore and at Kansas City. Kansas City's been their nemesis for a long, long time. Although we didn't play very well in that one game against them last year. We had a Thursday night game. The Chiefs all they could handle. And we'll take it out of bounds here is Kendra Miller. Holmes is everybody's nemesis. Of course. Andy Reid, the whole gang. You know, I'll tell you what, after tonight, everybody's talking about, you know, Caleb Williams, 4-2 with Chicago. Jaden Daniels, of course, with Washington. I mean, Boone Mix might get a little bit more notability after tonight. Yeah, and I think with him, you know, when you talk about Caleb Williams and Jaden Daniels, they have a lot of splash plays. You know, to me, it's about quarterbacking. It's about having a good defense, playing complementary football. They've got great special teams. Avoid the mistakes. They were able to do that for the most part tonight. You know, avoid turning the football over. They had the one fumble, but if they can play smart with Bo Nix, with this defense, they're going to be competitive. Rattler slides to a hold here at the 48-yard line. He's obviously not feeling 100% out there himself. Emotionally as well. They're freaking out tonight. Yowie. Miller. And then I'll make a third down and five as the clock keeps on rolling to the two-minute warning. And the two-minute warning is upon us. This is a two-minute warning. Yes, it is indeed. Meanwhile, you can stay tuned after the game, as always, for the JCPenney post. We rule, do we? You do. I don't know. Not really. And that pass is juggled and not caught by Tipton. And you've got a pass interference coming up here against Denver, so that will give them an automatic first down. Pass interference. Defense number 43. First down is a 5-5. So, Hayner, who's been the number two quarterback, he's actually got into a couple of games early on when those two blowout wins out of Fresno State. As is Derek Carr. Check out Rattler on the sideline. Painter, much more of a distributor. Get the ball out of his hands quick. He does there. And he hits Mason Tipton there. Second one. Let's see what happened to Rattler. Chased by McMillan. Taken down. On the interception. Yep. Insult to injury. Time out. Denver. The first of the half. Be 30 seconds in length. Talking about, you know, Sean Payton, the Super Bowl in his fourth year here, 2009. City getting resurrected after Katrina hit it.
