 The wind. The wind's a game changer for a lot of quarterbacks. Especially that swirling wind, the way it is here. Running back is Zonovan, ninth. From the 25-yard line, this drive starts. Play action, and then a pass into the ground. Because that time it was Andre Sisco, who created the earlier big play, second down and ten. And if you've not watched the Jets, that's an example of what Zach Wilson deals with from his home fans. That's a play that was designed to try to get the ball to the tight end on a delayed screen to the left. And the defense felt it, recognized it. All he could do is eat it, just throw it away, throw it into the ground. See the defense get out there, they're there. And so all he can do is throw that football away. But you can see how impatient this crowd is with his performance. Up the middle. Well, Mike White had been the quarterback because they were resetting Wilson. But he has fractured ribs. There he is. He's tried desperately to get back. He went to ten doctors. That's a guy that really wants to play, right? But he was trying to find, you talk about doctor shopping. He went to everybody but Zhivago and Julius Irving. But nobody was going to clear him. And there's Flacco, Joe Flacco. He's made a few starts. He has. Three, in fact, early on when Wilson wasn't ready to go after the knee injury. Third down and seven. And that pass is caught. First down and a lot more here. Tyler Cotsman before he is run out of bounds in Jacksonville territory. It's a good route by Elijah Moore. actually sets up a pick right here on the linebacker. In the middle, Chad Mumma, who's trying to stay with a tight end. Bang! He runs into his own man and kind of sets up, like I said, a screen or a pick on the middle linebacker and man coverage. Well-designed play by Mike LaFleur and really good execution, good read that time by Zach Wilson. 27-yard gain. Under six to play in the quarter. Through the middle. Gain of about three goes Michael Carter. This defense has the top tackler in the NFL, Lukan, and watch how quickly he diagnoses. And he said the difference between Atlanta, where he was the last few years, and now is how quickly he gets downhill. There he just avoids the block of Dwayne Brown. So him getting downhill and being able to make plays with his vision and instincts, as you see the sixth year out of Yale we had a great talk with him this week led the league in tackles last year and again meanwhile you've got Chris Streveler comes into the game at quarterback and takes a shotgun snap but there's a flag and our first penalty of the game will be announced by Brad Allen momentarily so how about that they bring Streveler part to the snap false start everyone but the center five-yard penalty. Second down. Schrembler, who we thought would be inactive tonight, he would be the fourth quarterback. And he came in just to run the football. They cleared everything out of the backfield, and that's the risk you take when you get off rhythm. You bring in a quarterback who hasn't played much at all this year, and the center, the only one not to snap the ball. Everybody else moves. It's affected the rhythm there, the offense. The opponent of Governe. So second down and 12 now. Pass is almost intercepted. Intended for Garrett Wilson and Darius Williams, who won the Super Bowl with the Rams last year, right there. Couldn't handle it. Third down. Here's the inconsistency, the communication between Garrett Wilson, which we've seen a lot this year, and Zach Wilson. He's throwing the ball to the inside, and Garrett Wilson's running that route further to the outside. shorted the defender. It's a really good look at it right there. And Williams frustrated. If he would have recognized that, he could have been able to pick that off and take it to the house. So Wilson starts one out of three for 27 yards. That pass to Conklin. Chase still backing up. And finally he just has to fling that one away. And there's a flag down all the way down to the 25-yard line. And that's going to go against the Jets. So that was a third and 12. And the next thing you'll see from New York is a punt. Pass interference. Offense number eight. The penalty is declined. Fourth down. Elijah Moore. Elijah Moore just trying to fight. But he's seven was Trevor. In the opening half. ETN. Wiggles his way out to the 30. the other thing about Trevor Lawrence and Kirk talked about early on Brady's the fastest at getting rid of it Lawrence 2.49 and then Burrow as well as Lawrence 2.49 and last year he was at 2.85 he was one of the longest in the league so that's a couple things we just showed you how his mechanics have been cleaned up the other thing is the mind when you have a lot of reps he played 17 games last year he's in a new offense he's making quicker decisions like that Second and seven catches made. Marvin Jones reaching, appears to be a little short at the first down. Tackled there by Quincy Williams, Quincy's brother. It'll be third down and one. Can the Jets make an early and much needed stop? They cannot. To the 41 on a sneak. Again, he is a big, powerful athlete with his lower body at 6'6", and not afraid to run the football. So a simple sneak turns into about a four-yard gain. Pretty good push there against that talented defensive front from New York. Doesn't it just feel like there's a rhythm to what Doug Peterson's doing right now with Trevor Lawrence? Tonight, last week, last few weeks, there's just a rhyme and a reason for everything that they do. No question. One of the reasons they are hot. And Lawrence, one of the hottest quarterbacks in the league. And this time it's Jermichael Hastie. Takes three or four guys to bring him down. They get second and five. And when you go through losing five straight in the month of October, and you drop the three and seven, and you live on the other end. You get through that. And then you have an epic win like last week, which he told us on our call, Super Bowl's my biggest win. NFC Championship's my second. And last week's win against Dallas, number three. That's how big of a win that was for him and his team. So improbable. Down by 17. Force overtime pass here. Caught by the 11-year veteran Marvin Jones. First down. I just think you've been around sports forever. When you see teams that can become potential threats late, they go through adversity, and instead of folding, they keep battling. They get to the other side, and then they become a united group, and that's who these Jags remind me of. Yeah, they have a look like that right now. Christian Kirk picks up about three. Yeah, and Doug Peterson, we were talking to him yesterday about going in there, and, I mean, they were a mess. They had Urban Meyer last year, won two games. We know how that ended. They had three wins. They've had four wins over two seasons, but then they went out and spent like crazy, got the right free agents. We'll see about the draft eventually, eventually, but he appears for the moment to be the right coach. Second and seven. You can see what some of the team has said about him. Trevor Lawrence really needed someone that's stable, comes in every day, always the same no matter what, doesn't panic. Josh Allen, have his back no matter what, respect him as a man, as a coach. The best thing you can have on a resume. Great energy, Tyler Shatley said, makes you want to jump on board. But he won a Super Bowl in his second year of five with the Eagles from the 46-yard line. Large throws, caught, first down and a lot more as the catch is made by Evan Ingram. He's pretty fired up there. Well, he's having a big night tonight. And this is a tight end, one-on-one against the top corner, arguably this year in the NFL. That's Sauce Gardner, the rookie out of Cincinnati. Look at that separation. That initial first step gets him that separation and the confidence that Trevor Lawrence has to look at the tight end and dial him up there on third down against Sauce Gardner, the corner. from the 24 now. Ingram has six catches for 106 yards. Play action. Dump it off. Catch made here by Dan Arnold in second. Flag is thrown. They had a man about five yards downfield. Juwan takes the night. Lawrence is over 100. Ball to 34. DTN. Down we go to Kaylee. Al, when Evan Ingram was playing for the Giants, he told me he watched from afar and appreciated how Doug Peterson utilized different types of tight ends in his Eagles offense. So then when Ingram was on the free agent market this offseason, he saw a really big opportunity in Jacksonville. So he said, I took a risk on a one-year deal. but with the belief that this scheme could put him in the conversation to become one of the top-paid tight ends in the league. For sure, because he saw what Doug did with Zach Ertz, Dallas Goddard, Trey Burton as well. Play action. And the pass into a lot of traffic to ETN. But that is Solomon Thomas, one-time number one pick at San Francisco. So when Salah was there, makes the stop. Yeah, and playing for this in this defense, it's also intelligence. It's not just getting upfield. They love to get vertical, but it's eyes in the backfield. And we saw it earlier from Quentin Williams, and now you see it from Solomon Thomas, who has great intelligence and recognition there. Because if you get Etienne out in space, that's a big game. Play that from the inside out just like that. 5 wide on 3rd and 10. Kirk, Christian Kirk, comes up about 3 yards shy. D.J. Reid makes the tackle. It's 4th down and 3. And they will send in Riley Patterson to attempt the field goal. This one will be 45 yards. And the wind swirling. This direction we're missing a lot in warm-ups tonight, but not this time. He even drew it a little bit. He's a classy man. Gave a lot back, always with a smile on his face. What a joy to watch he was. Incredible career for me growing up in the 70s. There was Cowboys fans and Steelers fans. And so many great battles between those two teams. And just a class act. Patterson. Steelers fans. He was so humble and gracious with his time. And, you know, always giving back. He'll be missed by so many. Wilson on first down. Under pressure. He's going to get sacked. Major pressure that time. Roy Robertson Harris comes bursting through in the Blue Birds route again. They're changing up their looks here. They actually cover up. Look at this. Kind of a bare front where they give you a lot of looks and a lot of big bodies in the interior. Creates a one-on-one matchup and throw in a little bit of a blitz and some stunt and a stunt up front and you get free. This is not a defense. It's active as far as getting after the quarterback, but as I said, I think as the year goes on, they're gaining more and more confidence with their ability to get to the quarterback. Second sack on them, and that's knocked down, so again the pressure. Robertson Harris is there again. Third and 18. Well, the crowd, impatient. They've been impatient for years here. Can't blame them. Robertson Harris had hits the screen, so he just goes right by the offensive lineman. He can't get to him, but he gets his hands up. He's an imposing guy at 6'6", 290. Great job of recognizing the ball out fast. Gets the hands up and knocks it down. That's another third and forever for this Jets offense. Third and 18. Only the 17th play they've run. Jacksonville has run 36. Catch is made. It's going to be another punch situation. Michael Carter is there. Well, we talked about the frustration of the Jets fans. It's been 11 years since they saw any postseason action. So, we reach the two-minute warning in the first half here. 13-3 Jaguars lands as the Jets will punt man to send it skyward for the third time toward Jamal Agnew. Magnum drifts makes the catch at the 29 The win and a lot of it has to do with the way 16 is executing Yeah, Houston next week and Tennessee comes to Jacksonville at the end ETN inside the 5 has a first down tackled at the 2 yard line and again that Walker Little taking over that left tackle with the block there meanwhile one of the Jets coming off the field here It'll be first and goal. There's that jet sweep look to affect the eyes, and then a quick flip the other way. Good job by Walker Little getting out front. And there's that acceleration again by Travis Etienne. The lead that is Will Parks? It is. It's Will Parks, the safety, who comes back to the bench under duress. Remember, he's in for LaMarcus Joyner, who's a starter. So Parks has been in for him. And now Tony Adams, 22, comes in to that spot. So a drive that started at the 4. This will be the 14th play. Nine runs, four passes, and seven first downs. And a touchdown counts as a first down. That would be eight first downs on a drive, which is something you almost never see. Meanwhile, Jacksonville takes a timeout. to win the division. Tennessee's limping home to the finish line, and Jacksonville's gaining momentum. That win against Dallas, of course, last week, the big come from behind win. Thrilling for the Jaguar fans. Thrilling for Doug Peterson as well. Meanwhile, first and goal, and working his way halfway to the goal line, goes ETN, second down and goal. I was telling you guys in a meeting this morning how high I am on Travis Etienne just because I saw him play so much in college and of course last year his rookie year with that injury you referred to the Liz Frank he missed the entire year I think people are just starting to see him get healthy and what he can do he is not just a speed guy he can lower his shoulder and run physically closing in on a thousand yards for the season to the outside can he get in and the officials say no he has stopped just short of the goal line. Jamion Sherwood makes the stop there. Third and goal. And meanwhile you've got that's a big injury here for Bennett Sheriff. The right guard. One of the major offseason pickups. Great player from Washington. So they work on him. Third and goal when we come back. Pro Bowler. So he makes his way to the bench. Here's what happened to him. Take a look at his, you'll see the right ankle, the left ankle right here. That's what you always worry about with offensive linemen getting rolled up on. Blake Hance comes in. Third down and goal from inside the one. Diving, the ball comes out! But he was over the line. He had possession as he crossed the goal line. So it is a touchdown. And what a drive. Eight, nine, They go 96 yards, 16 plays. Eight first downs along the way. That was a long one. This is the beauty of being 6'6", right, with the length. Get up in the air. He obviously breaks the plane. That's an easy one. And then the ball comes out. But, you know, when you're 6'6", and you have that kind of length, you're able to go up and over that defense. What a way to finish off that drive. That was their only third down play on that drive. So down the field they went in bits and pieces. Eight first downs along the way. First touchdown of the night. Riley Patterson for the extra point. High snap. A hook gets it down. And the kick was good. With 11 and a half to go in the half. And we're back in 30 seconds. They go 96 yards The smiling Trevor Lawrence Has given his team A 7 point advantage Things like this for me when I watched Trevor Lawrence How much more in command He is, the smiles The pats on the back He just looks like he's in charge He's become the face in his franchise this year, and I think you can see the look, how comfortable he is in that role with Doug Peterson as his head coach. And even the turnover late in the Dallas game coming back last week. Great point. Taking it to the two-yard line. Braxton Berrios, one of the best in the league. And he's out of bounds. Quick throw, and another first down as the Catch is made here by Evan Ingram. Having a good first quarter. He's already caught three for 41 yards. It's a good job again, Trevor Lawrence. This is an example of what he's been doing in these last six weeks, getting the ball out fast. Now watch Sauce Gardner. He's out on the outside, eyes on the quarterback, tries to be able to get in there, but there's just enough of an opening. And when you get the ball out quickly and accurately, good things happen to young quarterbacks. And, again, that's where Lawrence has been in these last six weeks. Not often do they go Gardner's way. From the 45-yard line. Good tackle made in the backfield here. And again, that's Jordan Whitehead. Stopping ET in. No gain. Second down and ten. We saw the safety come down on the other side with what the Jags were able to do. This time right here, it comes down late, kind of creeps down. There's just nobody there to be able to pick him up. You know, Jacksonville does a good job of running inside, and then they run reverses. And just to kind of keep you honest on the edges of the defense, they got the Cowboys a number of times last week with Jamal Agnew. It's just a nice wrinkle that they add along with their play-action pass game. Final minute of the quarter. Game tied at three, second and ten. Lawrence throws, and that is caught for another first down. Great-looking drive here. This time it is Dan Arnold holding it in. It's a tight zone. You're talking about going to Sauce Gardner. He's in zone this time, but he's got great length. So you've got to be able to get that football over top of him or between him and the safety Jordan Whitehead. Really good feel in the timing there of getting the ball out flat and on a line to the big tight end, who's a nice target. See, there's Sauce. He's got the receiver up front, which he bites on and allows Trevor Lawrence to go over top of him. Drive started back at the 4. Going out to 38 in the waning seconds. Lawrence. A lot of room to roam. And Trevor Lawrence to the 24-yard line. So a great-looking drive here as we come to the end of the first quarter. With the score, the Jaguars 3. Haley Hartung back here with Jets head coach Robert Sala. Coach, how do you describe the difference maker Quinning Williams is for your defense? He's unbelievable. I'm glad we got him back. He's a playmaker. Your defense has created opportunities. What do you need your offense to do to capitalize? Same thing. Just move the chains, get first down, score points. We still scored three on the takeaway. We've got to find more. Thank you. All right, thank you, Kaylee. Upstairs, Al Michaels, Kirk Herbstreet. Week 16. Start the second quarter. Great drive so far. Tenth play coming. It started back at their four for the Jaguars. Keep it on the ground. ETN going nowhere. Gain of one here. Jermaine Johnson with the tackle. Final play. At the end of the quarter, the pebbles come up. The pebbles come from the artificial turf. Carl Lawson made sure he ate those pebbles. Goes in for a facial between first and second quarter. Second down and 10 now. The ball at the 24-yard line. Out of the pocket. Keeps it. Reaches and comes close to picking up a first down. And they will spot the ball very close. As he says, first down. It all depends what the officials say here. This is the aspect of his game. people don't really appreciate yet in the NFL. In the college game, we saw this, and it's an area where he really grew in college is using his feet. That pump fake there and then extending the ball allows him to get that first down. But his athletic ability, really the last couple plays you've seen, what he can do with his feet. This drive, they have six first downs on the drive. Had the ball for six minutes from the 15. Keep it on the ground. Chugging for a gain of four. E.T. N., who's carried 10 times already for 46 yards. Think of the confidence that this team has as we are here with three weeks to go. They lost all five games that they played in the month of October, and then they get hot. They start to win some games, and they're beating Tennessee a couple weeks ago, division rival, the team at the top, and almost last week to come back against Dallas. You talk to them this week, it's just a team that believes that they can find a way to win. For this offense with Zach Wilson, they need a short field to get their confidence going to win this game tonight Zonovan Knight rookie out of North Carolina State Flanking Wilson in the backfield Wilson will keep it and stopped at the line of scrimmage by Devin Lloyd number 33 So Wilson started the season in week four remember he had a knee injury early in the season. Missed the first three games. Six touchdowns, six interceptions. The rating is well below the league average, but he still has a winning record, 5-3. Yeah, I think he's still searching for confidence and rhythm in this offense. I think right now you can almost feel on a third down incompletion, the crowd gets restless. He gets uncomfortable. He needs a good start tonight. Keep it on the ground. Knight to the outside forced out of bounds around the 12-yard line by Arden Key. Third down and five. Offensive coordinator for the Jets. There he is, Mike LaFleur. Brother Matt, of course, is the head coach of the Green Bay Packers. LaFleur was with Robert Sala in San Francisco. So when Sala got the job, he brought Mike with him. And I think Sala's blueprint is very similar to what you and I witnessed last week with San Francisco. This is a team that can win with defense. We just saw a sack in a turnover and just be efficient on offense. Be smart and not lose the game on this side of the football. That's where they are with Zach Wilson. Third and five. Under pressure and down he goes. Coming in almost untouched. Andre Sisco with the sack. Now this is what we're talking about. It's recognition. It's recognizing this blitz, the late movement right here. Watch the eyes and the head of the quarterback. and see if he feels this or sees that. Absolutely not. There's not an awareness there. And the Jacksonville Jaguars are recognizing late movement affects him. He's very lucky he held on to that football. Here's Zerline. Normally a chip shot kind of field goal, 37 yards, but not in this one. It's crazy tonight. And that kick is just good. Just inside the right upright. So the Jets are able to take advantage. Of the early turnover. Three and a half into the game. Three nothing. New York. Came over Evan Ingram. Really working with a new group of receivers outside of Marvin Jones. And in this first year system of Doug Peterson. More than anything. It's just reps. Making a lot of mistakes. Learning from them. And getting more comfortable in the NFL. And reading defenses. But he's got his hands full tonight. Against his Jets defense in these conditions. Well, as you know, of course, they're always talking about when the new coach changing the culture. But this was a team that really needed a culture change. No question about that. Every single guy we talked to talked about how much fun they're having. And, of course, winning helps that, right? 1,000%. From the goal line, Jamal Agnew up the middle, out to the 25-yard line. And Lawrence can go to work one more time. down three nothing three and a half into the game so four fumbles lost on the last seven opening drives including the costly one here if you're a Jets fan you love to see that turnover they have needed to create more turnovers the last five games they we been able to generate one turnover so that a big start for this defense You had a ton early in the season good point Got it here, cashed in for three. Lawrence under pressure, throws, reaching for it, making the grab. Is Garrett, is Engram, who's the former Giant tight end, having a good season. came over as a free agent from New York. Second down and five. Keep it on the ground, fighting his way a little short of the first down. ETN to make it third down, third and one. Really tough defense to get sideways on. You've got to get north and south, and a couple double teams up front here. Walker Little, who's in for Cam Robinson. and left tackle trying to help with a combo block, trying to set that edge there, a good push there, give him a chance to pick up that first down against Nathan Shepard. Peterson calling the plays from the 34. Let's see what he sent in. Play fake, and then the pass is caught here, and Ingram picks up the first down. Boy, they make a 10-yard penalty. First down. Connor Conklin. So, fewest TD passes by top two picks going all the way back to 67. Bradshaw, 13. Ryan Leaf, 8. I mean, he has some pretty good names over there. Bradshaw, Aikman, and Carr. Then you've got Jamarcus Russell, which is a whole other story. First and 20 here. And down he goes at the 25-yard line. So there's a couple things that you have to recognize here as they boo Zach Wilson. They continue to move backwards with penalties, self-inflicted wounds. They can't run the football. So whether Mike White's in there or Joe Namath's in there, this offense is in flux because of what's happening around the quarterback. I'm not saying that there isn't some things there with Zach Wilson. That's obvious. But tonight, you came in and you thought, we're going to win this game with defense and field position. and playing smart on offense and being able to run the ball, and they have seven yards rushing. The offensive line having its issues, the two tackles, injury problems. Meanwhile, he airs one out, and it is knocked away. Hanging in the air, it's Garrett Wilson, the intended receiver, but Tyson Campbell was right there, third and 25. Again, it has that feel where these deep throws are late. It's almost grabbastic, you know, just kind of throw it up and hope that Garrett Wilson, who's a really talented player, can make a play on it. And, you know, Campbell, who's their best corner, the ball is late and up in the air like that. He's going to either pick it off or knock it down. Especially in the wind, helping to hold it up. Third down and 25 now from the 25-yard line. Wilson throws, and that'll pick up a few yards, but not much. See the crowd's done enough going tonight? Davis makes the catch. Fourth down. Now one of eight on third downs. Most of these third downs have been third and ten plus. So 78 yards of total offense to 310 for the Jaguars. This is Mann's fifth punt of the night. The Jaguars have not punted. Man averaging 44 yards per attempt. And that one will bound out of bounds. And a flag is thrown back at the 15-yard line. Not sure. The crowd is chanting. I'm not sure whether they want Namath. Richard Todd, Ken O'Brien, Chad Pennington. There's your flag right there. A couple of face masks. After the play was over, personal foul, unnecessary roughness, 34 kicking team, 15-yard penalty at the end of the play. First down. Well, the ball peeped to the 45-yard line. They start this drive, a little spin-a-rama here, and it's Snoop Conner. His first carry of the night, the rookie out of Mississippi, picked in the fifth round, gets three yards. guy who's really physical as a runner coming out of Ole Miss 225 pounds is able to run through tackles like that right there Quincy Williams penetrates he's able to bounce off of him and after that penalty I mean the Jags with really good field position here starting in plus territory on second and seven through the middle Pick of those three. Connor again. Third and fourth. You know, you wonder the toll that a lack of offensive production, the toll it can take on the Jets' defense. A strong unit, but every time they go out there, they look at that scoreboard and they know there's not a lot of points going up on their side. You just wonder the body blows that they're taking here. At some point, do they just give out? Psychologically as much as the physical aspect of it. Well, the Jaguars have already had the ball for 27 and a half minutes. We still have four minutes to go in the third. Third and five. Taylor, the right tackle. So that will come back. You mentioned they're going after a little bit at Sauce Gardner tonight, who's been, like, reading books. He was in the Dion Richard Sherman category for a while. Nobody wanted to throw at him. Especially last week. Downfield. Offense. 75. 5-yard penalty. Still first down. Sean Taylor now. And that is the first penalty of the night against Jacksonville. Jets have at 5. First down and 15 now from the 28. Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill. Reload, reload. Reload. You got it. Little that time with the false start. Offense, number 72. Five-yard penalty. First down. I think, you know, you go 36 minutes without a penalty, and you get back-to-back at least. Well, you've got Cam Robinson, who's the starter at left tackle we've talked about tonight, is out for the year, and we wish him well. Walker Little has been playing well, but, you know, last week as a swing tackle, he had to play both the left and the right some. But when you heard all that cadence before the snap, kill, kill, kill, reload, reload, there's a lot to think about for a backup tackle. I think he overloaded, even as a Stanford guy there, and jumped the gun. Even as a Stanford guy. First and 20. Short game here from Marvin Jones. I love it. Even as a Stanford guy. Says the former Buckeye. Next week, we're going to go to Nashville to wrap up our regular season Amazon schedule. Prime, and it's the Dallas Cowboys against the Tennessee Titans. Well, last time we saw the Titans in Lambeau. They couldn't have looked any better and had not been able to win a game since then. Second and 18, and now Tannehill's gone. And that pass is dropped by Christian Kirk. Third and 18. Good enough ball to catch there, but Kirk, who's had a big year this year coming into this offense, just unable to bring it down. So it's a rare third down and long. Jacksonville has been really good tonight, converting 60% of their third downs. But they've been very manageable. This one's a little bit tougher for Lawrence and his offense. Coming up on the halfway mark of the third quarter on a third down and 18. Quick throw to the outside here. Agnew makes the catch. takes it to about the 23. It'll be about a 41-yard field goal attempt. Doug Peterson, tell Kaylee, I'm not going to apologize for going for points, and that throw right there tells you what he's doing again. He just wants to give him a better chance to get some points. Mosley, we haven't really called his name much, but got voted to another Pro Bowl yesterday, one of the top players in the league, and so instinctive. Four as a Raven, one now as a Jet. three defensive players plus a special teams player going to the Pro Bowl. And this kick is Jets quarterback Burden, kind of a carousel. Three of the last four seasons, they used three starting quarterbacks, Flacco, Wilson, and White this season. 52 teams over a 10-year period used three or more starting quarterbacks, and they won 37% of the games. Only six of those teams made the playoffs, most recently Washington. who did it in 2020. Well, John Madden used to say, you have two quarterbacks, much less three. You have none. Right. I think most people would agree with that. I think they have a real dilemma on their hands, not just tonight, but moving forward, trying to find that answer. Especially, you know, you use a number two pick overall. Meanwhile, that bounces, and it is with a flex. That just barely got out of bounds there. And comes out to the 40-yard line. Ten days before their next game, so we'll see about white and fractured ribs. Meanwhile, a flag is thrown as night goes nowhere. Against the Jets. Holding. Offense, number 83. to get back to get open. He just pushes off at the top of his route with that left hand. Just flings Williams and he's trying to work back. Braden Mann descended skyward down toward Jamal Agner. Gets it away. There was contact, but no flag. But now a flag comes in after that contact. And the punt goes out of bounds at the four-yard line. Caleb Johnson got to the punter. The ref's already indicating five yards. So it was fourth and 12. You know, you've got the out. I mean, that was a beautiful kick and out of bounds at about the four-yard line. Running into the kicker. Defense. If somebody has declined, the result of the play is a first down. Timeout. Right. It would have been fourth down and seven. Instead, they pin the Jaguars deep. 3-3 with 441 to go in the first. Pedigree in San Francisco. He comes in, and they're dead last. He turns it around very quickly and very effectively. You see the three players there. Quentin Williams, one of the best in the league up front in the interior. C.J. Mosley, an enforcer and leader. And now you have the rookie, Sauce Gardner, in the back end. I mean, they have really improved in their understanding and overall skill. All going to the Pro Bowl. Meanwhile, this is ETN, workhorse in this quarter. Six carries with 39 yards. The guy got picked along with Trevor in the first round, but he's now coming out favoring his shoulder, and he'll need a break. He is, I don't know if people realize how electrifying he can be, and as much as we're going to talk about Trevor Lawrence and his receivers, if ETN is healthy, wow, that'll keep defensive coordinators up late. Michael Hastie comes in in his stead and pushes forward for a nice game here. and a first down. Here's what happened to Etienne. End of the play that sent him to the bench. He had the foot last year, and that's what camped him out of a couple games this year. Comes down all his weight with Michael Clemens bringing him down. See, on that right shoulder, what you indicated. Hopefully he's going to be okay and be able to get back out there. Well, now with a 17, three and a half remaining in the opening quarter. Little dump off here, and the ball is loose and incomplete. A lot of traffic in the middle there. Quinton Williams was right there. I mean, an interior player reads this. This isn't a linebacker. You talk about instincts and feel. This is an interior defensive lineman with his eyes in the backfield right away sees screen. That's exceptional. That is a big athletic football player that understands the game as opposed to just rushing the quarterback. That's a great feel there by the big man. Move to Alabama. First-round pick back in 2019, number three overall. Second and ten. Lawrence fires to the outside. That defender falls down, and that creates some space for Jermichael Hastie to pick up the first. Kaylee, what you got? Al, C.J. Mosley told me that the key to this Jets defensive transformation has been buy-in to what's being asked of them by this coaching staff. And under defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich, that means giving your maximum effort 100% of the time. Mosley said players have so much respect for Ulbrich's decades spent playing in the league, and he's helped them understand how the game can pay you back tenfold when you do things the right way. Yeah, boy, we showed you the numbers on the transformation of the defense, which is astonishing. Meanwhile, Etienne is back in the game after missing two or three plays. It was popped there by Jordan Whitehead. Came over as a free agent pickup from the Buccaneers. Well, Albrecht demands that this defense fly to the football. You know, I talked about how hard it is to get wide on them because of their pursuit and effort, team speed. Look at that as a unit. Downhill, the safeties and backers, and then they're able to get sideline to sideline. That time, Jordan Whitehead, of course, is able to make that big collision. Second and seven. 251 yards for the Jaguars, the 66th. Of course, the time of possession. Two to one as well. Jaguars win the routine control of a path to the South Division title. They would then have to beat Houston next week and Tennessee the following week. Jets would finish week 16 in a playoff position to two of those three teams, Chargers and Dolphins and Patriots, were to lose. But the Jets need to win. And right now they are down by 10 and not looking very good. They need a first down. For starters. Forget about the playoff picture. Forget about everything. They need to run the football, and they need to get some first downs. They have three first downs to 13 for the Jacks. New York to get the ball here. Berrios, and he'll get taken down. Nice open field tackle by Tim Jones moments ago. Kaylee was with Doug Peterson. Coach, you have made a name for yourself going forward on fourth down. Talk us through your thinking at the end of the half. Well, right there, I felt like we had points on the board. I didn't want to risk anything, you know, and not give up or at least not get the three points. So, again, I know it was close, probably could have gone for it, but I wanted the three points in that moment, especially with the weather. With this rain coming down now, how is the weather going to impact the game planning for your offense in the second half? You know, we've been doing some really good things. I think up front, our offensive line, you know, we've got to continue to control the line of scrimmage, doing a nice job in the run game, and then we've got to pick our spots to throw the football. It's kind of tough. It's by quarter. But we do that. I think we'll be okay here in the same half. All right, and the Jets begin here with Corey Davis making the catch for a gain of six. I just can't say enough. I know it's a long way to go in his football game, but just a little thing. When they covered that kickoff and they had the Jets inside the 20, the reaction from the entire Jaguars sideline was like a college team. They all jumped. They're engaged. They're just really plugged in to what Doug Peterson's offering. Through the middle. Run it only for a gain of two Jets' first half possessions tonight. Of course, they had that short field after the sack fumble, so they got a field goal. Then three punts and a pick. Yeah, it has the feel that unless they make a big play downfield, it's hard to imagine them going the long haul to put points on the board against this defense with the way they're executing, not being able to run the ball and putting it all on Zach Wilson where he's proven that right now the game's moving really fast for him. Third and one. Wilson avoids the sack for the moment and throws into no man's land. Corey Davis, I guess, was the intended receiver. Fourth and one. he looked like he may run for it but a good job on third and short Devin Lloyd the rookie linebacker out of Utah he kind of baited him Lloyd comes up to take him away and he tries to make that changes his slot of his arm there and just kind of side arms it with an errant throw behind Davis a one minute 23 second possession to begin the third quarter Braden Mann flag Brad Allen to make his first call of the second half false start picking team number 87 five yard penalty yes Sal was hoping it was against Jacksonville which would have given him the first down And he's saying he'd bait it. You know, he's calling the cadence kind of jumping to try to pull the jets to make them move. So Mann will take the snap inside his 10-yard line. And this will be his fourth punt of the night. Line drive with good distance on it. And it bounces out of bounds. that they'll spot it somewhere inside the 25. Trevor Lawrence has improved with his mental approach, but I think he also has worked really hard to tighten up his delivery. This is last year. The big thing to see is how long that stride is. And when you have a long stride, it makes the release time a lot longer. Now look how much quicker and compact this is and how much quicker he's getting the ball out of his hand. And it has everything to do with kind of staying back and taking such a small step, creating force from the ground up. And he's really bought into that and made a big difference. 11 of 16, 1.45 seconds. Wilson underneath. That's made short game. Brad wants chunk plays here. It's Tyler Conklin. I'm going to take a timeout for a 7-yard pickup. the book on Zach Wilson right now is he'll be very inconsistent with the layups and then he'll throw a ball that makes you go oh my gosh how did that happen? So maybe they're thinking he's got one of those in him here to get in field goal range kind of like last week. He did. Rolled left through right 40 yards. I mean he had some chunk plays last week but they lost to Detroit giving up A big fourth down, which resulted in a touchdown at the end. Jerland getting ready for what he hopes is an opportunity to kick a field goal. Second down and three. Four-man rush to the outside. Well, that's not going to do much. And he didn't even get out of bounds, but then they take a timeout here. Nine seconds. You got to fling one, don't you? I think so. I think so. Remember last week at the end of regulation, didn't use his timeouts. Maybe he's using them here. Still has one or two left over, right? Yeah, they had some bad clock management at the end of the game last week. I thought he handled that pretty well, though, where he just got in front of the team and said, Guys, you guys make mistakes. I do too. I make mistakes. And I think he really got even more respect from his players when he said that. Put a second back on the clock. Third down and three with ten seconds. Wilson. Fires low and complete. He got five seconds now. Corey Davis. You know, you want a chance to punt here or just take the snap and run around and kill the five seconds? Yeah, he has time here to throw, and then he throws this one into the ground. You can see how, I mean, nobody's more frustrated with what's going on than Zach Wilson. Yeah, I'm with you. At the very least, just drop back, let it go, into the air. We're just fling one deep, deep, deep downfield. Yeah, deep down the right side with the three receivers. Timeout here. Meanwhile, let's take a look at that AFC playoff picture. Meanwhile, you've got Buffalo clinching a playoff spot. KC already now the West champion. Bengals red-hot are 10-4. and Tennessee reeling now 7-7 and the Jaguars right on their heels and the two of them will meet Titans and Jaguars in the closing game. In the hunt, you've got New England and the Jets and the Jaguars and the Raiders, Cleveland and Pittsburgh. Yeah, the race for that one seed is getting really tight. Cincinnati-Buffalo, I think, next week, right, in Cincinnati. Well now you got Garrett Wilson who was off in the races. Offense number 17. Five-yard penalty. Fourth down. Kind of a ragged end to a ragged performance by the offense. They've run 66, have run 20 plays for 66 yards. when you average less than three and a half per play you've got problems a bunch of three receivers to the right Wilson back to throw clock is at all zeros and that'll be picked off so that'll look good on the stat sheet Lloyd, he's going to lateral it we've seen this all weekend long to Andre Sisco well, well, well audio will tell you all you need to know and he took a shot at the end so coming up after the break with the score 13-3 Jaguars Mercedes-Benz halftime show with Carissa and the game After the championship. Keep a comparison, very one-sided. The Jets are on the opposite end of this, though, with some good news. They get back one of the most dominant defensive linemen in the NFL, with the return of Quinn Williams, who was out last week with a calf injury. Coach Sala told us he is impossible to block because of the power he brings to the game. Kaylee, thank you. Meanwhile, what is at stake? If the Jaguars win, they retain control of their path to the AFC South Division title. As we said, they win all three. They are in. Need no help. The Jets need some help. They finish week 16 if they win tonight in playoff position. And then if two of those three teams lose Chargers, Dolphins, or Patriots, they would be back in the number seven position and would have their path to the playoff security. Two coaches, Doug Peterson, who won the Super Bowl after the 2017 season with the Eagles' first year in Jacksonville, Robert Salam in his second season as the New York Jets head coach. So the Jets have won the toss. They have deferred. And thus we will see Trevor Lawrence as hot as any quarterback in the league over the past few weeks. Going to work on this wet and windy night. Temperature is in the 40s. The wind will be gusting probably up to almost 30 miles per hour. Incredible to see the work that Doug Peterson has done with this offense, and especially his quarterback. First fireman Ed. Getting the siren going at MetLife Stadium. For the Jets, as we mentioned, it's their final home game of the season. They're going to go to Seattle next week. They have lost four of their last five. There you go. Ready for action. And away we go. With a touchback. Last six games were Trevor Lawrence. It was great the other day. He 4 14 touchdown passes 1 interception in the last 6 games and that passer rating is about 20 points higher than the league average So the anointed one, Kirk was saying earlier today, ever since middle school, everybody had their eyes on this guy. Oh, he's been the guy. He's looked like that since about 9th grade, so he's destined for greatness. won the national championship with Clemson, his college mate. Etienne is in the backfield, and he takes the handoff and picks up about four yards to make it second down and six up at the 29-yard line. Trevor Lawrence, I feel that this offense has become an offense that he's comfortable with. You'll see tonight, the last six weeks that you referred to, I think it's just been a quarterback that has answers. No matter what the defense shows him, the chemistry that he's developed with his receivers that we'll talk about, and the confidence he has in Doug Peterson's scheme, he's just getting the ball out of his hands quickly. About two and a half seconds. Keep it on the ground here. Nothing doing. Carl Lawson, number 58, is right there to stop ETN to make it third down and six on the opening drive for the Jaguars. Remember, Cam Robinson is out. Walker Little is in right here at left tackle. and you're going to have to deal with a lot of penetration from this athletic defensive line. This time you see Carl Lawson with quickness moving from the outside to the inside, switching his gap responsibility. And Quinnen Williams, man, keep an eye on him in the interior. And he missed last week's game. Back tonight, third down and six. He'll be going to the Pro Bowl, Williams will. Lawrence with his first pass of the night, but won't get it off. The ball is now out. Brad Allen is there to signal they call it a fumble Jacksonville thinks they've retained possession but Allen says no it's the Jets ball and that's Quentin Williams and what a difference he makes being back in the lineup creates the fumble and the turnover right here Al Tyler Shatley to left guard gets a bad responsibility one on one on third down against Quentin Williams there isn't a guard in the league that's going to win that battle. And it is good to see him back in the middle of this Jets defense. Healthy offseason has taken his game to another level this year as an interior defender for this defense. That has been a problem for Trevor Lawrence. That's his eighth lost fumble of the season, the most in the league. And it's exactly the recipe. Ooh, over the bench he goes. And we check in with Kaylee. Well, Al, we got quick word from the Jaguars that their right guard, Brandon Scherf, is questionable. He'll return because of an ankle. You see him get rolled up on here. You guys called it out. You see that left ankle in peril. This team captain is such a trusted guy on this front line, but he's still in the medical tent, and athletic trainers are with him. Thank you, Kelly. Well, we talked about all of the free agent pickups, and he was as big as it got. Meanwhile, there is Berrios, who went head over heels over that bench, and then Wilson will go to work here from his own 33-yard line. Rolling, keeps his eyes downfield, completes it and picking up the first down with a nice little move to the inside. Garrett Wilson has a real good chance to wind up as the offensive rookie of the year. I love the call for Zach Wilson. Early down, boot, get him outside where he's comfortable. He loves to throw on the run. An easy read. A little over-under read. Just get it out to your athletic rookie receiver, Garrett Wilson, with a simple throw. Maybe that can get Zach Wilson going here. Here's Wilson who went hobbling off, rubbing his calf. From the 46-yard line. Little toss here. Flag, you saw that. And for the moment, you've got a nice run here by Sullivan Knight. But. Going to come back. Illegal formation. The tight end was covered up on the line of scrimmage. Five-yard penalty. First down. Two tight ends in the game to the quarterback's left and both of them up on the line of scrimmage. Wilson trying to work his way back in. The stellar year he has had. Rookie record for receiving yards. Breaking Keyshawn Johnson's old jet spot. First and 15 now. Play action. Deep drop. To the near side. That's caught here by Knight. And Knight close to picking up a first down. this is what I think you want to see the development of Zach Wilson instead of predetermining to throw this to Elijah Moore watch him look downfield he's looking right here to Elijah Moore he recognizes good tight coverage so instead of forcing it just check it down this is what Mike LaFleur and Robert Salah want to see don't force it especially in a game like this, check it down and let your skill guys make plays. Wilson is back in the game. So they needed 15, got 15. First down from the 44. Zonovan Knight again. Nothing. For the moment, breaks away, but only briefly. And taken down back at his 49 by Rayshon Jenkins, the big hero. Well, what a game he had last week. The game-winning pick six of Dak Prescott and 18 tackles in the game. That's the thing that gets overlooked, right? How involved he was in the run game. 18 tackles. You know, he's missed a bunch of tackles this year because he's so aggressive. But the hero last week, and he and Andre Sisco in the back end of this defense, statistically this defense isn't off the charts, but they're athletic, and I think they're gaining confidence as we get near the end of the year. Made up for all those missed tackles in one afternoon. Anyway, you saw the flag here. That stops play. False start. Offense number 76. Five-yard penalty. Second down. Right tackle, George Fant. We've had four different left tackles, five different right tackles. So many injuries this year up front for Robert Salah in this offense. You know you look at a lot of teams that have had problems this year it does start Normally with an offensive line Jets able to weather at least to this point with a seven and seven mark eight and a half to go here Wilson keeps his eyes downfield goes deep downfield into traffic and that's knocked away Darius Williams was there. Corey Davis, the intended receiver, back to third and 21. And we just bragged about how he's coming off of the deep throw, right? And not getting out of the 34-yard line. Jack Ryan did a Kobe game with the Steelers and the Giants. There wasn't a fan in here. It was the first game of the 2020 season. It was one wacko year, wasn't it? Oh, my gosh. Every single week. So this drive begins back at the 33-yard line with Etienne picking up three. Etienne right now, 17 carries in the first half. I know for Jets fans, they're booing Zach Wilson, but let's step back for a second. They want to win football games by their defense playing well and getting Trevor Lawrence off the field and then running the football and then putting him in favorable positions off play action. They have five running plays for four yards in his first half. Quick throw. Catch made by the grass-stained Evan Ingram. And their defense is supposed to be a top-five defense. How many plays was that drive of 18 plays or whatever? They went from their own four-yard line, 96 yards, and punched it in, controlled the clock. I mean, and you're supposed to be a team that prides yourself on defense, so it's easy to point the finger at Zach Wilson. But I think right now, the defense, which is supposed to be a strength in the running game, they're nonexistent. They'll need a stop here, otherwise Jacksonville will take it right to halftime. And they don't get this stop, and ETN makes the catch and takes it all the way to the New York 35-yard line, and the clock stops with 43 seconds. Well, the motion here really causes this. Watch the confusion by the defense. Now you've got a linebacker. Where are we going? So that had everything to do with what happened pre-snap as much as what happened during the play. Give Doug Peterson a tip of the cap with that execution. Great job of setting that up and freeing Travis Etienne there using that motion. From the 36-yard line. Under pressure. Gets it away and that pass is incomplete. And this Solomon Thomas came bursting through to force the throw. Second down to ten. And that's a win for Trevor Lawrence. He gets late pressure. Just throw this football away. There's no sense in trying to force it. No sense in taking a sack. Gets rid of the ball. 38 seconds to go in the half. And now he's at second down. So the night started ingloriously for Lawrence. Sack fumble, which led to a Jets field goal early on. Been all Jaguars since. Hasty is in the backfield. Shoots it to him a little bit behind him. And then will make it third down and 10 with 35 picks. A lot of the throws tonight from Trevor Lawrence have been quick throws to the outside. The rhythm to what Doug Peterson's trying to do. They'll run up into the interior. They'll bounce it with some reverses. Play action. But a lot of quick throws to the outside. I think that's the appreciation they have for the Jets' ability to rush the quarterback. They come in with sacks with 39 coming in to this game. Chip Olberg looking on. Third down and 10. ETN, who is in motion, makes the catch. And he's going to pick up the first down. Or close. Nope. They're going to mark it a little bit short. Jacksonville calls a timeout. it'll be fourth down an inches and we're back in 30 seconds if we can't check the spot here because it was very close but they say no he did not get it knee goes down there just a little short tiny bit so that's going to bring the field goal unit out from the 34 so a 44 yard attempt for Riley Patterson and that Kick. No good. Wide to the left. Are you surprised they didn't go for it there? A little bit. A little bit because they have the Jets right now on the ropes. They're not doing anything offensively. There's really no threat there and a chance to really take a punch here and knock them out. No question. And again, we talked about the wind. I don't want to belabor the point, but it's windy. It's swirling. And that creates the missed field goal there. And other than the sack on the opening drive where Lawrence lost the football and then this missed field goal, other than that, to be on the road in these conditions, it's been a flawless first half for Doug Peterson and the Jags. So 13-3. Can the Jets get into field goal range? Be careful. Yeah, tell me. I'm thinking the same thing you are. Have all of their time out for what that's worth with 20. Greedy and forcing the ball. And then a couple plays later, he ends up forcing it And throwing a ball that should have been intercepted there by Williams. Good effort there by Corey Davis to knock it away. Yeah, Williams almost had his second pick of the night. Missed on the first one. See the rain coming down right now. They expected a lot more. Might get some before the night is done. Michael Carter now in the backfield. Third and 21. A little dump off here. And getting into Jacksonville territory goes Michael Carter. put it fourth and long in there. Sheriff back out of the tent and walking a lot better as he heads back toward the sideline. I hear the fans booing. They're frustrated, but this offense gets behind the sticks, makes it so hard to try to execute. It's paramount. They've got to win with defense and they've got to be on schedule on offense. It's just that kind of team this year and you get behind the sticks. It's kind of kryptonite to what they're trying to do this year. Braden Mann sending it down to Agnew, who has seven career kick returns. And bobbles it and recovers $5 million-plus. Spent in offseason free agent acquisitions. Kirk Sheriff, Zay Jones having a big season. Ingram, one year for $9 million. A look on tremendous. And Darius Williams for $30 million. You look at four of those guys, and I think that Trent Baalke decided, listen, if we're going to do this with Doug Peterson, we've got to build around Trevor Lawrence. We're going to go all in, put our chips in the middle of the table, and let's build around him with talented receivers like Christian Kirk and Evan Ingram and tight ends, Zay Jones. And you get ETN back healthy, get stronger up front with the offensive line, and man, it's paid off. Trevor Lawrence has delivered with those new pieces around him. Sheriff back in. Now it really starts to come down. Expected heavy rain. And here it comes. Temperature's still in the low 40s. Beginning this drive from the 12-yard line. Stumbling in the backfield that time was ETN. Loss of one. Nathan Shepard makes the stop there. It'll be second down. And 11. It looked like he almost lost his handoff. Yeah. He's got his hands reversed there, and the ball just barely gets in there. He's just trying to take care of the ball and almost came out. It's going to get interesting now. Oh, yeah. In these conditions, wind picking up a little bit. Seven minutes to halftime. Lawrence. Keeping it. First down. And takes it out of bounds. So that's already a total of 11 first downs for Jacksonville to three for New York. Anybody who watched this guy play in college knows that he can cover a lot of ground. It's 6'6", and he's not afraid. You don't account for him, and you cover down like they do. Somebody better be there because of his speed. He's not just lumbering out there like a baby giraffe. This guy can go. He has got great speed, and he will make you pay for it. More like a gazelle. 10-3 the score. The first down here, ETN. How happy was Lawrence when they drafted ETN? Same draft, huh? Yeah, familiarity. And he would be the first one to tell you why he gets most of the headlines. he would tell you that the defense has to pay attention to the big playability and the big playability, the threat of it. Not just running the ball, but Travis Etienne, as people will see, he's really a receiver playing as a running back. He has that kind of skill with soft hands and route running. So he makes that defense have to keep their eyes on him and makes his job much easier at quarterback. Used disparity in plays, time of possession. Yardage, quick throw to the outside here. Ingram, breaking tackles. And the one-time giant, familiar with this stadium, rambles again. Now you'll love this. The receivers blocking for the tight end. There's just a rhythm to this offense. Just get the ball in space. Look at Christian Kirk. Look at Zay Jones. But look at that blocking to be able to give Ingram, who's a very athletic tight end, a chance to get out into the open field. Beautiful. 36-yard gain. He's already picked up 77 receiving yards. Made a lot of great moves in free agency. This is one of them. They spent $175 million in free agency, an NFL record. It's crazy, and it's paying off. This is a great read by Trevor Lawrence. See that collapse? He reads that, and because of that, he's able to dump the ball right behind it. They go no huddle here, pick up the pace early on, and a 4-yard gain to the 40-yard line for ETN. it. A quick decision like that from Trevor Lawrence gives you an idea of how he's seeing coverage, how he's recognizing things pre-snap and not predetermining what to do with the football. You saw that pressure from the outside. If he stayed wide, he would have handed that football off to ETN, but he read it perfectly. ETN's college teammate missed all of last season. Foot injury in camp. Lawrence, deep down field and reaching for an incomplete. Marvin Jones was there, battle for it, contested on the play. D.J. Reid was there to knock it away. It's third down and six. Sauce Gardner gets most of the attention, the rookie, but D.J. Reid is a technician and it's a heck of a matchup. The tandem between the two could be the best in the NFL. Great job of reading the eyes of the receiver Jones and then looking for the football, fighting with his hands, and then not giving up on that and eventually getting that football away from Marvin Jones. Third and six. They don't go Garfield's way at all. Meanwhile, big hold here and he almost lost the ball but takes it to the 20-yard line behind a Walker Little block. Left tackle, helping to lead the way that's again a 19. He leads the way. The center, Luke Fortner, who's a rookie himself at the University of Kentucky. He does a great job of setting that edge there in the middle. And then Little, of course, opens that up with a nice block there in the interior. And you see the acceleration on Travis Etienne. Already called his number five times. Ball at the 21-yard line. End around. Christian Kirk. and Kirk taken out of bounds after a short game. We talked about that free agency pickup. I mean, Trent Baalke and the front office, and Peterson, of course, had a lot to do with that. But Kirk comes over from Arizona. They picked him up. They picked up Zay Jones with three touchdowns last week, and Ingram has already caught a couple of passes tonight. Second-round pick of the Cardinals back in 17. Second down and six. Eighth play of the drive. Lawrence keeps it himself. Taken down just about at the line of scrimmage. It's popped there by C.J. Mosley, who will be going to the Pro Bowl for a fifth time in his career. He's long mesh point here, trying to read 91. Franklin Myers. Myers does a pretty good job of recovering to get back and get involved in this. I think he hands that football off. He's probably got a first down. But by staying on that ride as long as he did, he decides to pull it, thinking he could get to the corner. But the Jets' defense, just too much speed. third and three. They bring in Jamichael Hastie in the backfield on third down. Lawrence to the outside. Too deep. Tended for Kirk. Jordan Whitehead, former Buccaneer covering on the play. And in comes the field goal group to try to tie the game. One of last week's heroes, Riley Patterson, sent the game into overtime with a kick at the gun, 48 yards, to set him up for the win against Dallas. 32-yard attempt, and as we say, nothing's going to be easy tonight. That one is just good inside the left upright. You see the wind gusting probably up to the state before the night. It's done at about 30 miles an hour. Temperature is 41 degrees and a touch back here. Well, they said it was going to really pour, but it's been mainly this sort of light rain in the area for the last hour or so. Toughest thing for a quarterback in the rain, in the wind like this. The wind and the rain combo. I think a lot of quarterbacks, even receivers, rather have it where it's cold but not the wet. And then Christmas night on NBC will be the Buccaneers against the Cardinals from Arizona. And last Saturday delivered, right? Biggest comeback in NFL history. Unreal. And the Vikings and then the Bills and the Dolphins with an entertaining game that night. The endings last week were as crazy as they get. especially, you know, the Raider game. I don't know what to tell you. I don't know what to tell the Raiders. Meanwhile, here's Strebler to the 34-yard line. So he's now carried nine times for 53 yards. And that is DeJuan Smoot who will need the attention. Well, just right out of his stance, He just kind of loses his balance and goes down. Right out of the gate. And just stayed down. Right as he pushes off there. He's up now, which is a great sign. When you have a big lead, you still have some guys that are your starters out there. So Smoot gets assisted off the field. One thing we want to make mention of, ETN tonight, by the way, reached exactly 1,000 yards rushing. Right on it. Yep, 83 yards. He needed 83 to get to four figures. And by the time they're done with these next two games, you're going to have 1,000 yards back and potentially a couple thousand yard receivers. Who would have thought that at the beginning of the year? Nobody. Fourth and six. And that is incomplete. Put into double coverage there intended for Wilson. And that will turn it over and write a finish on a couple of kneel downs in a minute 35. So let's take a look at the NFC playoff picture right now. You got Eagles on top. Trying for that number one seed. Vikings are there. The West champion is San Francisco. South is still up for Grammys at the moment. Tampa Bay at 6-8. Dallas already in. Giants in pretty good shape right now at 8-5-1. Washington is there as well. And then those other teams, as they say, in the hunt. I think San Fran, I know they've potentially got to go on the road to Philly, but I think San Fran is a team in the NFC. And I also think Detroit is kind of like the Jacksonville of the NFC. They are. At the moment. really starting to show signs of being a team that if they get in, they would be a dangerous team to play. Some fabulous stories. I mean, we saw Brock Purdy last week. Can he lead that team to the Super Bowl? Starts the year basically as the number three quarterback. So Trevor Lawrence, first time I saw him in action, he's a great player. A lot of fun to watch. C.J. Beathard is going to take a couple of kneel downs to take us to the finish line. So what do you think Robert Sala will say? I mean, he'll kick the can down the road as to who's going to start in their next game at Seattle. Yeah, and of course we'll probably hear some of that on the postgame show, but I do think that he's going to have a dilemma because of where you mentioned earlier Zach Wilson was picked. I mean, if you're just taking that out and you're just looking at what you want to do, it's a pretty easy choice. You've got to get Mike White healthy, and you've got to go in that direction. And at the end of the day, I think once he's healthy, that's the direction that they're probably ultimately going to have to go. White will find that 11th doctor, and he'll be cleared to play. Well, that's going to wrap this one up. The Jaguars have now won three in a row. Two straight on the road. They were 1-22 in the last 23 road games until they beat Tennessee. and now they do it again. Two straight road wins for the first time in five seasons. Lawrence tonight in addition to what he did in the air. 51 yards on the ground. And the Jaguars win it by a score of 19-3. Don't go anywhere. Carissa and the guys wrapping things up from East Rutherford, New Jersey on the Google Pixel Post Game Show. Lawrence gets away, then he throws and making the catch on his backside at the 28-yard line. Are they going to say, Zay Jones, they're going to say incomplete. And Zay says, come on, man, I got it. With the scrambles we've seen, this time the defense is aware of that, and so they try to take it away. The ball definitely hits the ground there. But that time there's an awareness to Trevor Lawrence, so they come up to take it away, and then he does a good job to recognize it, Just not able to get enough on the throw. First punt of the night. Logan Cook. In case you're wondering, he's the Jaguars punter. Chris Streveler in the game. So we saw him come in and take one shotgun snap. And he hands the ball off. And he keeps it himself and takes it up to the 19-yard line. Good faking right there. Fake me out. Right. That's what he's really known for. The first time he came in is he ran the ball to the outside. Zach Wilson will continue to watch for the sideline. But he reads the in. Man, Arden Key collapses down. He pulls it. That old school zone read college football right there But positive yards something we not seen a lot of for the Jets in the run game Picked up six from the 19 Keeps it again. A little dump pass. And the crowd finally has something to cheer about. Elijah Moore with a first down. well it's a different offensive style that the Jags are trying to adjust to on the fly so you saw the zone read this time he gives the look then he's going to get outside see the backer takes away that threat of him running and a good job of recognizing that just dumping it over the top to an open receiver in space Strebler played both at Minnesota and South Dakota played in the Canadian Football League In effect, on the depth chart, he'd be the fourth quarterback. Keeps it here and gets tripped up by the ankle at the 28-yard line. Tackle is made there by Devon Hamilton. So Mike Caldwell, the defensive coordinator from the Jags, they thought the possibility probably of Joe Flacco coming in. I think this is a surprise. So they're trying to change on the fly. All of a sudden now, zone read, play action off of that. but quarterback threat running the football. Obviously now they have to have all eyes on that quarterback. Jets with their first first down of this half, only the fourth in the game. Sheveler has an open man, and he hits him, even though the pass was a little bit short at the 43-yard line. Gets it to C.J. Uzama, who had two touchdowns last week, and the crowd is uproarious. just said how this Jags defense is not prepared for this look. He's going to show the blocking and then release, and he just gets lost in coverage. Linebackers have their eyes on the threat of the quarterback running the ball. Nobody takes Uzama, who sneaks behind the linebackers and safeties. I don't think the Jags were preparing for him to be active tonight. No, not at all. This is Ty Johnson, first carry of the night. Flag is thrown. You're probably going to get a hold there by Dwayne Brown. Holding. Offense. Number 71. Big young friendly. First down. Andre Sisco, the safety, was trying to set the edge. Dwayne Brown locked up with him. And that's what ended up being the hold. C71. You'll see five come up. There he is. He's going to try to get out there. but Dwayne Brown locks him up, doesn't let him get to that edge, and gave the back Ty Johnson room to get down the sideline. But what a different, totally different feel as far as the scheme that they're trying to defend right now. First and 19. This is a guy who won a Grey Cup in Canada with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, and this time to the outside, and they take care of that. Running Knight into the bench, making it second down to 23. So the Jags have to think about what they did there, just setting the edges off this run game. You have to account for the quarterback run game as well. And then as you just saw with Uzama, you have to be careful of play action where the tight ends can get behind you. It's more of kind of option assignment football, which is tough to change to on the fly when looking to anticipate that ball coming out, is able to jump it. In almost one more step, he gets in front of that and intercepts it. Third down, 10. Can you keep the drive alive? He throws. That is caught, but backing up. And Elijah Moore is going to be a couple of yards shy. So it's fourth down. And the Jets leaving the offense out there. If nothing else, he's making quick decisions. You know, it helps all the execution. Great spacing with the routes. I know they didn't pick up the first down. It's just great to see a guy get the ball and make a decision and get the ball out of his hand. Completed five of nine for 53 yards. It's fourth down and two. Throwing. Caught. And the ball then comes out. They had the first down and more. and the next thing you know it's a turnover. Trey Herndon comes away with it after Garrett Wilson could not haul it in. The guy we talked about all week, you and I, Ola Khan, I think was involved in that in 23, knocks it out of there with his foot. There he is. One week from tonight we'll wrap up the TNF season in Nashville. Titans at home hosting the Dallas Cowboys. Meanwhile, you've got Cowboys who are in the playoffs right now, but trailing Philadelphia in the NFC East. For the record of 10-4 in the South. Of course, we've been talking about this all night long. Tennessee is 7-7, and the Jags at 6-8. So after the turnover, this drive starts with an ETN run. Meanwhile, you go back to the turnover here, and it's an accidental kicking of the ball by Luicon right there. Comes up, no penalty. Making the tackle. Kicks it away. Turns it over on what would have been a first down. And this is a guy with next-gen stacks telling us 1,383 consecutive snaps played since week 12. That's the longest active streak in the National Football League. It's powered by AWS. Came over from Atlanta. They tried to keep him, but Jacksonville made him too good of an offer. Meanwhile, there is Wilson giving up the ball. And Ola Conboy, he's not just killed that middle linebacker spot. He's become the leader and the enforcer of that defense in the middle of it. UTN, yep. Some player, I mean, you think about the timeout taken by the Jets here. So we'll step away with 3.57 to play in regulation. It's our high school athletes now. Thank you, Kaylee. The timeout taken there by the Jets. So you've got a third down and five. Jets have one timeout left. Ball at the 19-yard line as the Jags try to make it three wins in a row. And just keep nipping at those Titans. Fake. Chase. Look out. Lawrence avoids the sack. Gets it away and it's incomplete. So it's fourth down. Pop there by Michael Clemens at the end. So the chase was on and they get to him. he looks for a penalty and doesn't get one on one hand you love the way they're competing to the end but this is the risk you take with your quarterback who's going to try to make a play and then bang I mean that is a huge hit from the rookie from Texas A&M Michael Clemens who finishes that clean almost got caught in a sandwich meanwhile field goal group comes out here will be about a 37-yard attempt. Patterson tonight has made three, missed one. And now they step in, get set, and he tries to make it 19-3, which he does. This week in Tennessee at home. The Jets a week from Sunday at Seattle and finish at Miami. Any interesting things? Using his legs. Third and seven. The deep drop. The throw on the sideline. Hold in. There's Zay Jones. Coming off that game in which he had six catches and three touchdowns against Dallas. Yeah, what a throw and a great route here by Zay Jones, who keeps getting better and better in this system. The timing is perfect. Good tight coverage there by D.J. Reid. But when you throw the ball like this on a line away from the defender, that's a tough throw, and he makes it look easy. 222 passing yards to go with 51 on the ground for Trevor Lawrence. coming around the end Zay Jones nothing doing there it's Quincy Williams making the tackle that plays effective in this Jags offense but it feels a little different when Jamal Agnew 39 is running it with his speed Zay Jones not quite the same kind of juice coming around the corner but you love again the rhythm and kind of the way this system works and when you have a quarterback Again, every time he makes a throw, we showed you the stats, how it's on average 2.21, but he's making such quick decisions because of the recognition of defense. Pass is caught in the 39-yard line. Goes Evan Engram, who's already up and over 100 yards tonight. That's 113 on seven catches, and then picked up in free agency. 36. Pump fake. Scrambles away. Throws against the grain and complete. Fourth down. So Jacksonville on the heels of Tennessee right now. Tennessee leading the Texans this weekend. Then we get Tennessee next week in our game against Dallas. Of course, at the end of the year, it's these guys against Tennessee in Jacksonville. And you mentioned earlier Ryan Tannehill now out for the year. Malik Willis will more than likely step up. Titans is trying to right the ship right now. Logan Cook's punt will bounce at the two. And it will be spotted at the one-yard line. who led that brilliant drive but gave it up on fourth down at the end. He takes over here. Into the outside goes the pass for a short game. You know, they go to Seattle. Pete Carroll's already thinking about it. Now, wait a second. I mean, who are the Jets going to start at quarterback in 10 days? Well, maybe White. The health of Mike White would be, you would think, the front runner. I don't know if Zach Wilson will play again this year. Second and six. Treviler gets out of the end zone, brings it back to the four. He wants a face mask, and he will get one. In fact, there are two flags on the play. One's at the goal line, the other thrown at the end of the play, and Brent Allen will sort it out for us. Personal foul. Grasping the face mask. Defense, number 52. 15-yard penalty. Automatic first down. Al, I think to answer your question, if Mike White's able to get healthy, I think you go back to your traditional offense with Mike White. But Strebler planting the seed of just a package, right? You sprinkle him in to make the defenses have to prepare and have to be aware of it. With Joe Flacco as the other quarterback, started the season, played sparingly since. Second down. Strebel actually played for Arizona back in the 2020 season at the end of the season he was on the Ravens practice squad he was on Miami's practice squad and he had five touchdown passes in preseason this year the most in the NFL there's the former Super Bowl champ looking on with the jacket 16-3 is the score Five minutes to go. Second down and ten. That pass is knocked away and incomplete. Darius Williams having a nice night. Broke it up. Yeah, Williams just sitting on that out cut. The one thing that's obvious with Strebler in there is, you know, they're going to run the football and they're going to throw a quick passing game. So the corners know to anticipate throws that are underneath. See his head turn. Anytime the official steps in front, the Jets, of course, have substituted, so you have to give the Jags enough time. But it looked like they already had their 11 on the field, and they were ready to play. I thought so, too. The Jags were not trying to get anybody on the field. Exactly, but they stopped it. They're trying to snap it quickly. Third down and one. Straveler hands the ball off and it's going to be a fourth down play coming up. Zonovan Knight gets tackled there by Josh Allen so it's fourth down again. You go back to that third down, the play that they waved off he was under center and he had a bootleg that was called they come back the next play after the officials stop the play, they go to a shotgun play, which was clearly not their first call that they wanted to go with. I think it really affected the rhythm of what the Jets were doing on this drive. This will be the 16th play of the drive. 11 of the 15 have been runs. Straveler throws and it's incomplete. Intended there for Wilson. Darius Williams with the coverage. And if nothing else has kept everybody who's here in their seats, provided a spark on that drive, which comes to a halt to the third team. And now Lawrence takes over and throws to the open man at the 28-yard line, Zane Jones. Let's take a look at our next-gen stats, powered by AWS. And it's been Trevor Lawrence getting the ball out of his hands. You can see 2.21 on average, second fastest in his career. Been a great game plan by Doug Peterson, spreading the ball, a lot of quick throws underneath, forcing this New York Jets defense to have to make a lot of tackles in space and some great blocks by the receivers that aren't involved in making the catch and showing that they can block downfield. Second and ten under pressure, and he gets it away, and that's caught for a first down there by Christian Kirk. as Quan Alexander came in untouched. I think you see the confidence that Doug Peterson has as we get here late in the year in Trevor Lawrence. I mean, you're in control of this game. It's 16-3. You would think, okay, a great time to body blow this Jets defense, run the football, work some clock. But no, you know, even backed up deep in his own territory, gives the ball to 16 and lets him do his thing. once again number one ETN 19th carry of the game for 74 yards for him a durable ETN and a healthy ETN is essential if the Jags are going to make a real run here not just tonight but Houston next week finish up with Tennessee and then hopefully for the Jags sake they get into the postseason Quinton Williams getting arrested at least on this play second and one on chase out of the pocket seeks the sideline gets the first down chased by C.J. Mosley again there's the legs of Trevor Lawrence I mean you come free through the A-gap with a Pro Bowl linebacker and C.J. Mosley and look at this Look at the sudden movement from Trevor Lawrence and the speed to be able to get that first down. As soon as he took that shotgun snap, 57's right in his face. And he has the speed to get out of that. Seven carries the knife for 51 yards. Over seven yards per tote from the 40. He even told us, he said, you know, in the NFL, it's as much about the mental challenges as it is the physical challenges because you're going to make so many mistakes and face so much adversity. And I think this year he's broken through that, right? And now you're seeing him play more relaxed and more confident. See, Jones couldn't handle that. I know how thrilled you were. I asked him the other day, I said, hey, that win against, you know, the Cowboys last week, where do you rank that? He's just right up there with beating Ohio State, right? He did. That was the first thing he thought of. It was a playoff game out at the Fiesta Bowl in Phoenix where he didn't make a ton of plays with his arm. He had to make it with his legs. He found a way to lead his team to a victory that night. And you haven't prepped for it all week. Second down and 23. Strebler. Going to run it. Takes it to the 40-yard line. and that's going to take us to the fourth quarter but the crowd gets back into it at 16-3 after three back with the fourth from postseason probability powered by AWS meanwhile with a win Doug Peterson's Jaguars 52% with a loss down to one chance out of four Robert Sallow with the win the Jets 35% but they lose 9% meanwhile start the fourth quarter with a third and nine and Strebler who's provided a spark there he goes for a first down they started at their own 14 yard line they've gone 55 yards in 8 plays you love to see a quarterback that's going to go out here and just play fast and execute and not be timid and in this style of offense you can do that better execution up front Fant tried to pull around unable to get around but still a nice hole and good patience you can tell how comfortable he is in running this offense They had three first downs before this drive started. They have three on this drive. Keeps it again. Tough running. Seven-yard game tackled by Jenkins. First a great read, you know, as far as the collapse on the edge there by Josh Allen. But what you love, 41 collapses down, blows up the back. Now he's a ball carrier. And how about this at the end of the run? Bang! and lowers his shoulder on Rayshon Jenkins and runs through it. Five carries for him, 39 yards. Averaging eight yards per carry. Second and two. To the outside. Well, two weeks ago we did a game in Los Angeles. because it was 16-3 and Baker Mayfield came in. This guy comes in here. You don't think, do you? You don't think. I can't imagine. I can't imagine. But I'll tell you this. I'm as impressed with the job that Mike LaFleur and this offensive line, how they've shifted gears. It's one thing to see Trevler come in. But the offensive line, it's a totally different. It's like you threw away the playbook that you would use with Flacco and Mike White and Zach Wilson, and you bring in this brand new playbook, and really you're executing it pretty well here. Totally. Pass. It's dropped. Oh, it's right in the hands of Corey Davis, who's been known to drop a few, and it's fourth down and four. Couldn't have put that ball in any better of a place. Josh Allen drops. He gives it between him and Alokan and the corner, Tyson Campbell. perfectly thrown ball right there on third down going forward on fourth and four from the 26 yard line can the magic continue the running back is Ty Johnson Strebler throwing and going down to the ground and holding it in and forward progress will get Wilson the first down Garrett Wilson needed four got four and a half And now Strebler wants to take him up to the line. No huddle. He doesn't want anybody to review the spot or the catch. Just hurry up and snap the ball. And they do. And he hands the ball off. And it's a six-yard pickup for Ty Johnson. Fourth-year man out of Maryland. Second and four. Connor McGovern, the center here, does a good job of sustaining his block. and opening that up. And there's a rhythm finally to this offense that's been missing. Watch the middle 60. Great job of locking up that nose guard and getting a good push and finishing that block. Michael Carter back in as the running back. Fourteenth play of the drive. Give it to Carter. He'll be about a yard shy. 11.45 to go in regulation. Smoot makes the stop. Third and one. This system, the offensive line's coming off the ball. You know, we've not seen them do that, even early in this game when they were trying to establish the run. Takes the snap under center, but before he does. Down. For Jacksonville, tonight on a big stage, you knew they were going to be motivated. Off the win against Dallas, you've got the big game with Tennessee. Everybody's thinking about controlling your own destiny. Be careful with the game at Houston. It's like the ultimate sandwich game, right, where you have to make sure you show up. Houston seems to compete every single week, and it's their only win of the year. Right. They beat Jacksonville. Berrios takes it back to the 30-yard line. I'll tell you what's really funny. So the Jaguars have been to the playoffs once in 14 years. That was in 2017. People forget they were 2 minutes and 48 seconds from going to the Super Bowl. They had the lead against New England. They shot Con right there, and they would have faced Doug Peterson's Philadelphia team. You were pulling for that, right? That was your Super Bowl that year. We didn't know what to pull for. Close games, right? That's all we pulled for. We wanted a great game, and we got one with New England and Philadelphia, obviously. From the 26-yard line, Strebler caught. Got a six-yard gain from Michael Carter. Three and a half to go, second down and four. Strebler. dancing throws on the run and that's hold in there by Michael Carter and that's a first down with 3.11 to play again if nothing else the game's out of reach the kid's competitive he's got some fight in him and he doesn't care what the score is he's thrilled to death to be out there and just giving his offense a chance he hasn't been out there long but look at the production 37 rushing yards Well things are going to really get interesting Press conference after the game will be very interesting as well There goes Strebler On the ground again into Jaguar territory She's now carried 7 times to 46 yards rest of the team has 14 total yards rushing second and two and that's caught to the 37 yard line goes Michael Carter two and a half to go Jags just obviously just sitting back keep everything in front of them trying to keep everything in bounds and let that clock keep ticking It's been a rainy night, but for the most part, it's been light rain that's been falling. Wind wasn't as bad. I remember, you know, with the flag thrown here. They talked about... Offense number 76. Five-yard penalty. First down. So, bomb cyclone, right? It's like just another way to say it's a big storm. I think that came into the parlance of whatever it is, weathered them a few years ago. A bomb cyclone is coming in. Not tonight. Not tonight. You assure me of that, right? You're taking off after the game. I'm assuring you of that. First and 15. Strebler. And it's a short gain, and the tackle is actually made inbounds to keep that clock going. Conklin makes the grab there. Strebler wants to get him to the line. Try to get a playoff before the two-minute warning. which he does dancing away on the ground again turns it into a short game takes a shot right there from a little calm so it'll be third down and that is now the two minute warning so what else is there coming up next to Google Pixel post game show gang will wrap up tonight Interviews with the stars of the game. The watch list for Saturday now. You've got games coming up on Saturday, which is Christmas Eve. Giants of Minnesota, 1 o'clock on Fox. You've got Cincinnati, New England. Bill Belichick would say we're on to Cincinnati. Eagles, Cowboys, Fox Saturday. Raiders Pittsburgh and of course they'll retire the number of the late Frank O'Hara Saturday night on the NFL Network and then on Christmas Day Packers Dolphins on Fox Broncos Rams on CBS and Nickelodeon
