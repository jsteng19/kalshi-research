 Most of the returns, all these kickoffs with the new rule, these dirty kicks where the ball bounces and comes at odd angles. You need two good return men, so Devin Singletary, the other one's back for the Giants. All right, somebody's going to get in the win column unless we end up with a tie tonight. See if it's the Chiefs or the Giants. And off we go from MetLife. Singletary over to get it at the eight-yard line. And it worked back to the middle of the field. And take it to the 31, and that's where the Giants' offense will begin. Russell Wilson from the whole pack of badges. Tyrone Tracy Jr., Purdue. Darius Slayton, Auburn. Wando Robinson, Kentucky and Nebraska. Malik Nabors, LSU. Theo Johnson, Penn State. Andrew Thomas, Georgia. John Rodion, Michigan. John Michael Schmitz, Minnesota. Greg Van Roten, Penn Quakers. Jermaine Laminar, Blackwater Dream College. Big smile big story for the Giants is that left side 78 the return their left tackle Andrew Thomas number four overall pick he's been out since week six of last year with foot surgery question if he's going to go right up until late yesterday and he will start for the Giants Russell Wilson and Kevin, he begins with 31. Harold Tracy, the first carry, slugs forward for a yard and no more. It is Russell Wilson's third start for the Giants. In his second, he had his second highest passing yard total of his long career, 450 at Dallas last Sunday. This is the fourth team now for Wilson, third in the last three years. And as we alluded to on this field, he won the Super Bowl here with the Seahawks. It's a great matchup whenever you go against Kansas City and Steve Spagnuolo, their defensive coordinator. He's got a lot of experience with that. Tracy, the back, two tight ends in the backfield, blocked four, but he's got a first down at the 41-yard line. Good run by Tracy out of Purdue. Good job right up front here. That's John Michael Schmitz, the center, who's going to just get out in front of this thing. A little unusual backfield, that inverted wishbone, and Tracy comes out with a hot hand, and that's always the question. Whoever gets hot of these running backs, they stay in. First down, Wilson double punches, slips it inside. Tracy, it will hang on to it, gets to the 46 against the Kansas City defense. Charles Minerva, Texas. Derek Nottie, FSU. Chris Jones. Mississippi State. George Karloftis. Purdue. Drew Tranquil. Notre Dame. Nick Bolton. Mizzou. Leo Chanel. Wisconsin. Trent McDuffie. Washington. D. Cook. Cincinnati. Tamar Conner. Virginia Tech. Jalen Wison. WSU. Steve Spagnuolo, the defensive coordinator. Four times Super Bowl champ as a coordinator, including one memorable one for Giants fans, Super Bowl XLII. Tracy again. This time takes it into Chiefs Territory. Jordan Karloftis tracks him down, but it is a first down for the Giants. And we'll try to figure out, Chris, what Steve Spagnuolo has on that small card that has a lot of options on it. Well, and so far what he's doing, because the New York Giants a week ago were bombs away, right? So now he's starting the game with two safeties deep. He's basically daring them to try and run the football. And the Giants have answered that so far. So if he can get at least one of those safeties to walk down, help against the run, he has a chance. Five plays, five touches for Tracy. And only a yard there tomorrow. Connor, Karloftis, Drew Tranquil among those in there for this Kansas City defense. A lot of drafting and really put some good players on that side of the ball. Yeah, exactly what happened here. You're going to see the safety come out of the middle of the field, fit right in there against the run. So when you get that eighth body down in there, there's no one to block him. Able to stop the run. Tracy goes out. Cam Scadaboo is in the lineup for the Giants. The rookie out of Arizona State. Off a good game last week against the Cowboys. There is the hard running Scadaboo. Spinning. Turning. Turning it up there. Scadaboo. Kind of back that Giants fans will love. If he can do it the way he did it at ASU. First down Giants. Nick Bolton don't feel badly we've been watching this back in his college days and now in his NFL days as well. Cam Scadaboo getting his crowd fired up it's really fun to watch him play a little buzz going anytime he can do that Chris Jones off the field for the Chiefs as we get to play seven of this opening drive for Wilson and the Giants Scadaboo that time in the backfield. George Karloff just got a free run and had three other players come with him. It's going to be interesting to see how Andrew Thomas, the left tackle, can hold up here early, right? I think, though, just having him in the lineup adds a little confidence to them. They're not afraid to come out and try and run the football here early in the game. I don't think he can go the whole game. Maybe 25-30 plays, but certainly a major factor having one of the best left tackles in the game. Back in for the Giants. Wilson scans the field, comes back to Scadaboo in the middle. Tackled by Bolton and Tranquil. Melissa, what about the left tackle spot for the Giants? Yeah, I spoke to head coach Brian Dable in pregame warm-ups. He told me that he will be on a snap count. Didn't have a specific number. They just have to see how he holds up. I also spoke to Thomas pregame and I asked what's your biggest challenge tonight? He said the Chiefs have a really good defensive front. I have to be quick on my feet. Keep an eye on him. We're also going to keep an eye on the place kicking situation for the Giants and Graham Gonneau who has had a bit of a groin issue that may have popped up here before the game. So as we're on the edge of field goal range here the punter Jamie Gillen is warming up on the opposite side. Run each side. In about 4 to the 28-yard line. Let's see what Daybo will do with that issue. Giants are going to look to go for it here on fourth down. Yeah, so many times now in today's game, when you see a run on third and medium like that, it is because they've made the decision they're going for it on fourth down. Certainly, at the very least, a hard count here. But in all likelihood, they are going for it. They see the bat, fourth and three. Chiefs bring some pressure and they knock it down from Wilton. So the extra hands coming in there, Nick Bolton may have been the one to knock it down along with Chris Jones up front. The Chiefs stop the Giants on fourth down and they get nothing out of this opening drive. So Casey's defense heard from first. The Chiefs and Mahomes will get the ball at the 32. as well. Patrick Mahomes and Russell Wilson. Russell Wilson turned 30 this week. Takes over at the 28. Being chased right away. It's been the story of the season. We're pumping right out of bounds. And Wilson will gain about 4 yards at the 32-yard line. Chris, he's their leading rusher. It's been a lot of Russell Wilson running for this early part of the season. Yeah, Andy Reid said he's good with that, but that was before he turned 30, which was this. Like, it's enough. Stop. Mahomes, who I meant to say, Chris, who you see the numbers, the 123 rushing yards, leads the team, which is kind of odd when you consider they've got running backs who you've seen perform well before, like Pacheco and Hunt. And there is Pacheco out of the backfield at the 35-yard line. He has stopped there. Fabio Caracay taking care of business, and the Giants put Mahomes and Casey in third at about three yards. And there is a different look here for the New York Giants in this game already. They have Abdul Carter, one of their edge rushers, their top draft pick this year, basically playing inside linebacker right now because of all the injuries that they've had there. There he is, 51 for the Giants, their number three overall pick. Third and three from the home. Kareem Hunt, the back. Looking that way, goes underneath, caught by Juju Smith-Schuster for the first down. Dante Banks brings him down, but it's a KC first down at the 42-yard line. It's a good job. They really had Bobby O'Karrake right in the middle here, who was going to run under Kelsey. So he goes to the second choice. That's why you run those double slants. You don't like the first one or there's somebody clogging up the middle of it. The outside throw should be fairly easy. And Mike and he went on, Mike and he went on, right here, right here on the left. Communication there at the line, a scrimmage in his punt. Run it to the left. A little push there for about three yards for this Kansas City offense. Patrick Mahomes II, Texas Tech University. Isaiah Pacheco, Rutgers University. Hollywood Brown, Oklahoma. Tarquan Thornton, Baylor University. Juju Smith-Schuster, USC. Travis Kelsey. Cleveland Heights, Ohio. Josh Simmons. The Ohio State University. Kingsley Shumatia. BYU. Creed Humphrey. Oklahoma. Trey Smith. University of Tennessee. Juwan Taylor. Florida. Big name still missing Xavier Worthy. Injured on the third play of the opener in Brazil. Practice this week. Still out with the shoulder. So they're trying to get other guys involved. And that is Noah Gray. It's been a quiet season for the tight end. But that catch is coming back for a holding penalty. That's the rookie, the Chiefs first round pick, Josh Simmons. He is, and he's going against one of the absolute best in Brian Burns. Watch him come and dip underneath Simmons. Very few people have the ability to keep their power rush going and go underneath an offensive lineman like that. Nobody does it in this league better than Brian Burns. He is tremendous at turning that edge, and it's going to be quite the challenge for Josh Simmons, who really pitched a shutout a week ago in that game that they had then. Juju Smith-Schuster has some space. Away from a tackle, across midfield, and picks up a first down. Juju Smith-Schuster still showing the wheels here in year eight. gets the first down. Mahomes up over the top, semi no look, and get the ball in the hands of Juju Smith-Schuster. And, Mike, one of the things from watching some of the film of Kansas City this week is they need more plays like that where Smith-Schuster made somebody miss. They haven't been breaking tackles in the open field the way we've seen them in the past. 18 yards there. Mahomes going to take a shot downfield. tries to get the timing on the sideline, but out of bounds is Tyquan Fortin. Chris, they've come close a couple of times to connecting. Couldn't do it against the Giants' defense. Kayvon Thibodeau, Oregon. Sexy Dixie, Clemson. Roy Robertson-Harris, SGP Warriors. Brian Burris, Florida State. Fabio Carriquet, Stanford. Twayze Bozeman, Tri-County Academy. Paulson Adebo, Stanford University. Drew Phillips, Kentucky. Tyler Newbin, Minnesota. Vaughn Holland, University of Oregon. Cordell fly LSU They added Holland and the D bone that secondary those good pass rushes. You need to get better not into 10 yards allowed in the first two games On the sideline slung out of bounds Maybe a long yard here like what we're seeing are some really tight formations out of the Kansas City Chiefs I think it's because of all the pass rushers that the Giants can throw at them So they want chip help from the backs from the tight ends even the wide receivers before they go out And so far that's been a good formula and they're the team that was so great at chipping guys over the last couple of years That little advantage to give the homes an extra second Officially 32 Kareem Hunt slands it inside. He gets the first down. Inside the 40. Chiefs will move the chains at the 36. Already ten and a half minutes into this opening quarter. So far pretty methodical, right? We've seen the opportunity here for Patrick Mahomes to just sort of get this going. Now, the weird thing about the Chiefs this year, though, has been once they've gotten the ball down in the red zone, that's when they haven't been able to score touchdowns. It used to be that was the show, right? They would come down, all these trick plays and all the different things. So far this year, Mahomes has a zero quarterback rating in the red zone. You said that. I thought you were crazy. There is Mahomes. Pumping, pumping. Down the third option to Kelsey. He's incomplete. And that's just a little bit of what you said. It just hasn't looked like the Chiefs in the first two games. Witness that play. It's bizarre. I mean, there's nothing I can say about it. Here he comes right here. He just got to turn around. I mean, that's on the playground, right? I mean, that one, you know, fifth grade we were hitting that pass. Kelty's been in the middle of a couple of key plays early on in this Kansas City season, including the bobble in the end zone last week against Philadelphia. That led to a turtle. Mahomes putting it up sideline. Nothing going for Kelty. Blanketed by Tyler Newbin. So 0-2 targeting Kelsey in its third and long. And that's really what it's been. I mean, two of their top four receivers are not playing. Xavier Worthy out with a great speed. Rasheed Rice, who is that alternative guy inside. But it's been third downs and red zone that really have beaten the Chiefs in the first couple of games. Here we go again on third down. And a timeout taken by the Giants. Didn't like what they had set up. So the Giants will call for a timeout. Chris, you mentioned Rasheed Rice, third-year receiver out of SMU, suspended for the first six games of this season. It's four games last year. It has been that attempt to find those game-breaking receivers to set everything back up for the Chiefs offense. That plus the way defenses are playing them, and that wow factor just hasn't been there the last year plus. Yeah, Xavier Worthy is the speed guy, right? He was the one who could take the top off, stretch the defense, make them back up, and then it was Rasheed Rice and it was Travis Kelsey working underneath that was the magic of this offense. But you take out half the receivers, you're not going to look the same, and it has not looked the same. They'll tell you, in camp during the summer, things looked really good. They knew they weren't going to have Rice, but then Worthy getting hurt. And a collision with Kelsey on the third play of the season down in Brazil. Changed the fortunes. Giants bringing four. Picked up for the moment. The Mahomes throw is incomplete for Hollywood Brown. No separation. With the coverage downfield from Drew Phillips. And a field goal attempt at 50-plus coming up. At some point against the Chiefs, you have to win in man coverage. And that guy right there, Drew Phillips, with the only interception by a DB in this game, right on the money, gets his head around, gets the benefit of the doubt of a little contact. Beautifully done. Harrison Butker, one miss on the season. It was a first quarter miss against Philly last week of 58 yards. This from 54. Flicks it in. Had that right-to-left turn and caught the inside of the upright. To slide in for the first points of the game. Harrison Butker, 54. And the Chiefs ring the bell for the first time here tonight. 3-0, KC. Mark Amento, Brandon Glass, our entire team. Wade Junko over there. Booth crew reporting for duty here at MetLife. Butger after the doink with the kickoff Singletary with the return for the Giants and a nice one takes it out The 36 yard line that's where Russell Wilson will start Chris. We watch Giants practice on Friday Russell Wilson walks into the meeting It's almost like let me clear my throat and remind everybody what I've done in this game Because he felt pretty good after the performance against the Cowboys and he should he was brilliant at 450 yards, and it was sort of on top of a week that didn't go very well against Washington, and some of the Jackson Dart stuff started sprinkling around, and then people having that conversation, and then, wham, Russell Wilson hit him with a big one, and that noise is quieting. 36-0, it slags his car. The first down with Darius Slayton, depending on the mark, maybe just short, just short. At the 45-yard line, the catch for Slayton. And now in his seventh year, he has a job. But, you know, for Russell Wilson, it's like, all right, we got out of Denver. And we basically told him either take this, let's get rid of the guarantees, or you're going to get benched. He got benched. He didn't take the guarantees. He comes here. It wasn't good on opening day. And it was almost like he exhaled after that game last week against Dallas. Inside run here. We'll get them the first down. Tyrone Tracy's going to stop at the 49-yard line. So after the long stretch in Seattle, obviously Super Bowl didn't end great, goes to Denver. But then that Pittsburgh year, and Russell told us, I wanted to go somewhere where it was all about ball. We know the Steelers' legacy and Mike Tomlin. That was almost like a cleanse for him. And then coming here, and they draft Jackson Dart. So there's a guy who's a first-round pick sitting in the wings. So that's why maybe that performance was a reminder for Russ to everybody else. I can still do this when I turn 37 in November at a very high level. Especially the deep balls. When he gets the deep ball going and he has the receivers to do it, it is pretty awesome. Inside run for Tracy, 4-2. You know, Giants fans, they're sitting back going, no, I want to see the young guy. I want to see the new guy. I want to see him now. It'll take time, but that was an encouraging offensive performance, and Brian Dayball knows what he can do with Russell Wilson as his quarterback. And seeing some of that build last week was a big deal. Now, can they do it again against a defense institution pretty good? But let's remember that Patrick Mahomes set out his entire first year until the very last game, and that worked out okay. You think? 100 seconds left in this first quarter. Goes swing by Wilson and Tyrone Tracy. a collision on the sideline and Tracy is not getting up. He got hit hard and the Chiefs athletic training staff over there make sure he stays stable for the moment until the Giants staff can come over and get a look at the back. Up, Ginger with that right arm that got sandwiched in there and he went reaching for it right away. Cam Scadaboo, the rookie comes in for the Giants running back on third and five. High snap Wilson great big hands to pull it down Nick bolted moves everywhere on this Kansas City defense erased it for the loss of a yard I'm gonna try to get the ball out quickly here, but when you get that high snap you have to Hang on and then the timing of the play just gets fouled up Scataboo is looking for the face mask. He saw it there in the replay, and the Giants fans saw it on the big screen. It is fourth and sixth. And it's lining up to go for it for the moment. They wouldn't get the first down yardage, but they would get it to fourth and one and then go for it if it worked. But it didn't, so it'll drop it back. And the Giants will punch it away. Offense. Five-yard penalty. Still fourth down. Scatterboot. You saw him as he turned around and got hit right away. He was looking for that call. And Brian Dable was unhappy about it on the sideline as well. And there it was. And after Dable saw it on the big screen, he let the officials know about it. The Giants were penalized a lot last week, 14 times for 160 yards. They're going to get one in their favor there. They did not, so the lefty, Jamie Gillen, will kick it. Nico Romijo is back for KC. The team's a huge target this Sunday in the NFL. Chiefs trying to get out of the way. That one backed up on Gillen. It'll be downed at the 18. Chiefs take over there in 30 seconds after this. from AWS. Tenth 0-2 start in the last 13 years. Giants team trying to just get something positive going. A couple of division losses to start the season. Final seconds of this opening quarter. Kareem Hunt will run it inside. Four about three and a half and that'll bring the first quarter to end. The only points a Kansas City field goal by Harrison Butker. After one here at MetLife, KC3, the Giants nothing. On this 21st night of September, Sunday Night Football continues after these messages. It's great, Lawrence Taylor. They're playing Taylor Swift's song, Welcome to New York. And everybody's like, oh, is she here? We haven't seen her. I don't think she's here. But Swifties, hang on. Hang with us through the night. It's your favorite team. Mahomes pressured, setting up the screen. There is Kareem Hunt with some space brought down by Brian Burns. eventually. They're going to mark them with that extra yardage out to the 32-yard line. KC first down. And I think both these teams are trying to avoid having their quarterback sit too long in the pocket. I mean, this is a who's who of pass rushers. Dexter Lawrence at the nose tackle position is good a pass rusher as you'll see at that position. Sexy Dexy they call him. Then Kayvon Thibodeau has been tremendous and Brian Burns and Abdul Carter, even Bobby Okereke can rush the quarterback, so they're not holding the ball back there. First down, Mahomes, pressing by Kibbeno, gets rid of it. Wait a minute. I thought he caught it and had a knee down. Yeah. Is it backwards? I'm not sure. I thought he caught it with a knee down. Let's see what happened here. Is it backwards on that pass by Mahomes? Even if he caught it with a knee down and then he threw the ball away, that ball should be free, right? It was just like Pacheco stopped after the play. Chiefs are coming out quick. There's Mahomes throwing it to Pacheco, and it did bounce. Yeah, it's got to be at least an illegal forward pass. Right, Terry? So, Chris, what they ruled was an incomplete forward pass, the very first one. So the play is over at that point. They can't create an illegal forward pass for what number 10 does. Now, what they can do is fix it as a backward pass and give Kansas City the ball where it hits the ground. Being challenged by New York and will be reviewed. That makes sense. Yes, it makes plays. The ball will be placed with a spot of recovery, second down. There you see the backwards pass. It's going to be a loss of eight, second and 18. And then the whistle blew ending the play there. So anything that happened after that doesn't become part of the replay situation. It bounced Kansas City picked up the ball. So just the backward pass Giants win the challenge essentially there So they'll still have a couple more coming up in his second and 18 for Kansas City Tight end Final play. Preliminary indication is illegal contact on the Giants. Which is huge. After second and long. Bail out for KC. Illegal contact. Defense number 22. A five-yard penalty with an automatic first down. I think the tight ends of the Kansas City Chiefs do that as well as anybody in the NFL. They will go down, and when they see a defensive back sitting beyond five yards, they will smash right into it. You can see Travis Kelsey do it all the time, and a lot of times they get that very call. No graze of dookie. He wants Kelsey do it. He's got smart. He figured it out. Remigio coming around the end, and the speedy kick for Turner. Does a nice job to take it very close to the 40-yard line. That'll be a KC first down. Move the chains. And Russell Wilson, who really had it going a week ago, has been contained so far. And I think that you have to start with Steve Spagnuolo and what he's done. He has played it back. He is not giving up the deep ball. And right now the Giants aren't moving the ball with those shorter, quicker throws. Mahomes first down. Doing that Mahomes thing in the pocket. Just looking for space to make a play. And he does again. Smith-Schuster into the Giants' territory. A first down at the 33-yard line. Nobody does it better than Patrick. 27 on the game. Mike, have you ever gone on Halloween in a maze before? And you do like that. And you're looking at mirrors. And all of a sudden, you finally escape and come out the other side. And you go, oh, thank goodness, the monsters are gone. And all my friends are waiting way down the field down there. It's unbelievable. And it was all within the pocket. It wasn't like scrambling crazy. From the 33, Mahomes escaping again. This time, two chaser. Use that sideline and duck out of bounds before the hit. Mahomes so crafty to try to draw flags over there on the sideline. Turns it into a game. But that was exactly what I was talking about in the opening on camera. If you let Patrick Mahomes get that stuff going, you're in for a long night. They have the athletes up front. This is one of the most athletic front four pass rushing groups that there is anywhere in the NFL. You can't let number 15 run around like that for six or seven seconds. and beat you. That's how you get beat. Penalties and letting him escape. Set him down. Set him up. Set him up. Get that screen out there. And the coverage is terrific from Tyler Newbin. Dave Gray. Very little space. And don't forget Kayvon Thibodeau is coming in with some pressure as well. Kayvon Thibodeau I think has looked great so far this year. I really do. I don't know if it's the wrestling stuff he did or what. I just think he looks bigger quicker stronger more on balance. I Really think he's gonna have a big year This fourth he was a fifth round fifth overall pick in the draft and used a little wrestling technique to try to Find a one more page in his book To get after the quarterback Third and twelve Mahomes again escaping flank down as my homes puts the shoulder down to try to get the first down he's at the 21 yard line let's check with that flag is back at the line of scrimmage early indication it's on KC illegal formation offense number 74 five yard penalty third down has been the problem with Juwan Taylor over the last couple of a while now that was a big play to areas not close enough to the line scrimmage Didn break the center belt line Therefore the flag and third and 17 Out quick to Gray. Gets in closer field goal from here. Will be 48 yards. So Mahomes takes little time. And gives Butker a better look at it. But again, Mike, we've seen it game after game. When you try to rush Mahomes with four, what do you do? Do you play to keep him in the box and squeeze him? Or do you let these athletes really go after him? Tonight they're going after him and he's creating those seams and escaping. Bunker, who hits a natural draw when he kicks, hit a big draw on the last one. He was good from 54. And he'll find the center of the fairway again from 48. So Bunker with a field goal 6-0 KC Right adjacent to MetLife State 6-0 Chiefs on top And Bunker with the kick On back by Singletary for the third time and he's at the 26-yard line Chris Well the great Andrew Thomas is back in the lineup for the Giants It's their left tackle. I know not a lot of people get excited about left tackles, but I do, so we're just going to go ahead and show this anyway. When he's back in the game, it's a different football team. You have one side of your pass protection secured. You have additional running space in there, and right now he looks really good coming off that Liz Frank surgery. It has been a long time, 343 days since he played in the game, and so far he looks terrific. Jackson for 15 plays. As he has been out there throughout the first couple of drives. This drive three. Wilson trying to take a shot downfield towards neighbors. And that ball got hit on the way he was releasing it. And it's incomplete. Well, you could almost anticipate their longest completion up to this point was nine yards. And that's after bombing away a week ago. But this time, uh-uh, Jalen Watson came around on a corner blitz. And it's the thing you have to worry about. When you're playing the Kansas City Chiefs, this is a team that blitzes more out of the secondary than any other team. Bar enough. Any other team. And you see why. They have guys that know what they're doing and they get there. We saw Watson do that a lot against Philly last week. Singletary down the back. O'Neal Chenault has him there for about two yards. Melissa? Yeah, a couple injury updates for the Giants. We found out just before kickoff, as you mentioned, that kicker Graham Gonneau is questionable with a groin injury. He has a wrap around that thigh. If he can't go, punter Jamie Gillen will be handling all kicking duties. Gillen is also the holder. So if that is the case, Gunnar Osheski will be the holder. And then as for running back Tyrone Tracy, we saw him coming off, grabbing that right shoulder in a lot of pain. He had a stability test, went immediately into the X-ray. Ray Rune, he is questionable to return. And Melissa, the Giants only have two backs up behind him with Skadaboo and Singletary. Third and seven. Wilson deep drop. Shot downfield towards one. Robinson is picked off. Running underneath for Kansas City. Chris Roland Wallace. And he's out of bounds right around midfield. Only one defensive snap coming into this game. But one of the players there are going to get in the rotation more. And Roland Wallace comes up with the INT. I think the Giants finally lost their patience. You're going to see it looks like it's going to be something. They had neighbors double teamed on the other side. But then as the ball was coming down, it was Wandale Robinson who basically just drifted away. And instead, Roland Wallace attacked the football and got the pick. Second one of his career. And the Chiefs will take over with good field position. On Bosco, number one, number three high schools in Jersey. Big meeting coming up this weekend. after the turnover. She's having the 47. And it's a run for Isaiah Pacheco inside the 40 to the 39. Well, we've seen it work magic over the years. Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelsey and so far tonight just has not been on the same page. That was something you don't see very often right there. Then they tried to set him up on a little semi-pick and roll down the boundary. And I don't know that Travis Kelsey is that number one target at this point right now. A pass complete to Taequann Thornton. And he's out of bounds at the 32-yard line. But what he is is a tremendous complementary player. He helps with the blocking. He chips. He gets out. And when he gets somewhere around the 5- to 10-yard area and starts with all those little wiggle moves and Mahomes knows exactly what he's going to do. He just picks apart defenses, and unfortunately they don't have the Xavier Worthy. They don't have the Rasheed Rice to stretch the field, and it really shows out here right now. Down Mahomes gives Pacheco. It's a 26-yard line before Burns brings him down, and that's the other part of what Kansas City wants to establish, getting rushing yards from the running backs, not Mahomes' scrambles. Yeah, Mahomes leads the NFL like 9 1⁄2 yards to carry, and the running backs are closer to about 3 1⁄2 yards per carry. So they really need to shift that burden over to Isaiah Pacheco, Green Hunt. Looks like they're trying. Taking it forward. Jack springing forward. Mahomes leading it to Kelsey. He's got it for the first down. And Travis just marked right around the 20-yard line. So this is what they do really well. Watch the little pick over here. And here comes Kelsey across the field. When they're working in tight, short range, it's really hard to contain him. He's so clever. He's just one of those sort of magician receivers out there that has a way of getting open. And the tighter to the line of scrimmage they are, it seems like the more efficient they are. Shark Smith out of the backfield. Could not connect with Mahomes. Passing complete. Swayze Bozeman closing in on him. The Giants have a bunch of injuries at linebacker. And Bozeman, who's a chief for a few games last year, played a big role here tonight. Yeah, and these quick throws are not allowing some of these pass rushers to get going. Sexy Dexter Lawrence up there is trying. I mean, he has been exploding into that B gap here, and it has just been so far. Mahomes has either escaped when they've gotten close or just gotten rid of it. Guys, bring an extra man here. It's Kosey on the edge. Not going anywhere. Drew Phillips for the second time tonight. Comes up with a good play for the Giants and will force third and long for KC. So what you'll see a lot are when they go wide here, they do that to create the one-on-one with the center right in the middle of the field. Try and get that single block on Abdul Carter, but so far Mahomes has had an answer for it and a quick answer every time he's seen that. Lost at 2, 3rd and 12. What a pass rush by Burns. Deflected and incomplete. As that pass was trying to find Smith-Schuster, but Deontay Banks was in the way. It'll bring up fourth down and another field goal attempt. One of the reasons that Jawan Taylor does not like being right on the line of scrimmage is he needs some help. With this guy's coming off the edge, It can get a little embarrassing sometimes. Ryan Burns has the ability with quickness to get around you or just simply run right through you. And he is a powerful guy. Already three sacks on the season, and he's on a heater right now. Butker, good from 54 and 48. Missed from 40. Off the left hash, no draw. No good. No points. Giants defense steps up. Keeps that good field position. And nothing to show for him. Greatest catch I've ever seen. Yes. And I still say it. Because I don't know how he got fouled. I don't know how he went out of bounds. And he caught it with three fingers. Yes. I don't care what kind of gloves he had on. Greatest catch I've ever seen. First down, Cam Scataboo trying to get the Giants started with a run to the left. Four, six yards. In the meantime, the guys made a bunch of catches and great catches. Travis Kelsey. This was as we were in break on the sideline. Andy Reid and Travis Kelsey. We've seen them before kind of get heated there. But you can sense the frustration on both sides of that story. It's not their offense because they don't have their players running this offense. On the outside, they don't have the skilled players they once had. Scadaboo first down to the 48-yard line. He was fifth in the Heisman voting at over 2,300 yards in scrimmage last year, and he just provides juice to the team. Yeah, you got a little bit on the outside. They're running towards Andrew Thomas as well and just creating some space now. But there's something about Scadaboo that sort of excites you, whether you're in practice. I mean, you can tell. He's just talking trash. He's having fun. He's like a kid on the playground. He's 23 years old. What the heck? Give him the ball. Maybe give it over to Malik Bapers a little bit, too, here. Giants trying to connect with their top receiver as well. Wilkes is throwing underneath and is caught. Slayton not touched. So if he can get up, he's at the 49. Hey, Melissa. Yes. Cam Scatigoo described himself to me as an old school back saying, I always tell people I was born 20 years too late. He told me when he was younger, he would fight with his brother Leonard, who was six years older and quite a bit bigger. And that taught him he shouldn't be scared of anybody, no matter what size they are. And he said, I have a great ability to be lower to the ground so I can use all my power when I hit somebody. Can you imagine the amount of laundry detergent used on his jerseys over the years? Jersey always dirty. Tough player, plays with energy. Here he is. And the Chiefs say, OK, that's enough of that. No, that was a bad shot. He got a little excited on that one. He had an opportunity, but he cut back behind his own blocker, and that's not good. Loss of a couple of Nick Bolton, Leo Chanel there on the tackle. And Scannaboo, when he's in the huddle or getting ready to line up, he kind of shakes his head. I think he's almost talking to himself out there. Watch it, and he'll just kind of shake his head and say, all right, let's go. He could have made the all-Madden team. Oh, no doubt. No doubt. Third day here for the Giants. Only five first downs in this first half. Chiefs bring it five. Wilton dumping it out. Scadaboo first down. Flagged out from the secondary. Scadaboo down at the 34-yard line. The Laminaries' illegal contact on the Chiefs. Giants will keep this one rolling. We'll hear from Land Clark. Illegal contact. Defense, number 20. The penalty's declined. The result of the play is the first down. The rookie, Noel Williams. We had a heavyweight championship fight going on on the outside out there. You've got Andrew Thomas. You've got Chris Jones one-on-one. That one goes to Thomas. Brilliant play by Russell Wilson. I don't want to take anything away from that one, but Andrew Thomas, if they can just get it going a little bit, is really making a difference for the Giants up front. Malik Neighbors, top of the screen for the Giants. First and 10 for 34, keep it on the ground. Singletary left for a yard. We continue to watch Thomas, who you pointed out there in that blocking with Chris Jones. He has played all 24 of the Giants snaps so far. And the big game wrecker up front for the Chiefs. Great for the moment. Two-minute warning. Chris get himself right back in there. Two to go. Eli Manning during the break over there. Playing one of those games with one of the fans. I was thinking he missed a few early on. I was thinking, boy, he wouldn't do that. Then he just threw it in the other guy's hole. He needed some help. He started throwing them at each other. He wouldn't have missed any if he was playing the Patriots in the Super Bowl. That's for sure. Second and nine here for Russell Wilson and the Giants. Swing it out towards Scadaboo. Oh, he got a hand on it, which left it in the air and free, but no Chief could catch the ricochet, and it's incomplete. That was one of my least favorite plays that ever happened to me in my career. I did exactly this. My hand got under the ball, and it got intercepted. That ball I think would have been an interception had in fact Somebody been able to get there, but it was unbelievable my hands were on the ground and I literally couldn't catch it It bounces shoots up in here and the guy got it It's a 52 yard field goal from here remember we told you Graham Gano is injured it might be the puncher Jamie Gillen kicking depends with the Giants to here Wilson putting it up top on third down Swag is down late as there's contact by Wilson the pass falls incomplete did they rough him personal foul roughing the passer defense number 56 50 yard penalty first down George Karloftis part of a meeting at the quarterback yeah right at the snap of the ball Karloftis turned away like he was going to drop and then came in and once he got there just could not pull up, and so penalties now keeping the Giants in the game. Two steps. They're going to call that automatically every time you get one. That second step, then contact, bang, flag, and the Giants are in the red zone at the 19-yard line. And we have still not seen Malik Nabors get anywhere close to the ball. I'd hand it to him on a reverse anything. Just get him the ball somehow. Scadaboo trying to work inside. Nothing going there. Flag in late. Flag in late from the back judge. The preliminary is a hold on the Chiefs. Holding. Defense number 95. Five-yard penalty. It's an automatic first down. That's on Chris Jones. So what do they do? Defensive tackles sometimes will grab hold of an offensive lineman, one of these guys in here, and make sure they don't get off up to the linebacker so Nick Bolton can sneak through just like he did and make the play. And it's amazing how good these officials are getting it, seeing it from depth. Used to be there was an umpire right behind them. That umpire would play best buddies with the middle linebacker, right? And just have a good look at it. But instead, the back judges backed up in the end zone close to the goal line. About 20 yards away. There's neighbors. The Giants, big threat. First and 10th for the 14th. Scadaboo inside. Scadaboo to the goal line. In for the touchdown. Oh! Welcome to New York, Cam Scadaboo. A little wham block inside by the tight end, Daniel Bellinger. John Michael Schmitz with a good block, but the story in New York City right now is Cam Scadaboo. People are just having a blast watching this young man play. All right, Olszewski, the returner, is the holder. Gillen, the puncher, is the kicker. And it's blocked. Another blocked kick on this day of blocked kicks. And it will remain 6-6. And he's a lefty kicker to boot as well. So they practice a few times, but it only is 6 instead of 7. Scadaboo, the great balance, propelling to the end zone to even this game up. Time to get that kickoff was super slow, and it was very low. So Gillen for the injured Gonneau, who has kicked off this year a bit, that's taken back at the goal line and brought out by Rashard Smith, who turns into it at the 21-yard line. That's where KC will take over. Chris, let's go back to that blocked extra point. Yeah, it hit everything over here. First, the laces were back left-handed. That was a weird hold, and then went off the helmet, and then went off a hand. That was a doink-doink. Helmet high block. That does say low kick. If that would have hit one of the uprights, that would have been an all-time, a triple doink. That would have been good. That happened week two last year against Washington in Toree, and he came in, missed an extra point. They didn't kick the rest of the game. Pass for Gray, incomplete. Drew Phillips in coverage for the third time tonight. So a minute 35 left. Chiefs get the ball to start the second half. And I want to keep a close eye and watch if they go to Kelsey, how much they go to Kelsey. Remember the frustration he was showing on the sideline last time the offense was out there. Yeah, and Drew Phillips is giving these tight ends fits out there. Number 22 is playing. Mahomes gets in there at the end to take it away Mike, I can't tell you how good a play that is. So many quarterbacks would have done nothing here, right? He knew better than anybody. This is a backwards pass. New York, the second and a half. And all of a sudden, that thing is understood immediately, and he stole it. Took it away from him. That's a turnover created by Patrick Mahomes. Oh, my gosh. I mean, not only did he save the touchdown, but he also got the ball back. Wow. I mean, he put it in harm's way. For the second time. That's right. Second time like that. I mean, this is, we have seen, the Kansas City Chiefs have been like the coolest team ever. Yeah. Right? In the clutch, when it matters most, those guys, they take a deep breath, and they methodically go down the field. and they win Super Bowls, and we've just seen it so many different times. And tonight is just further proof that they are unsettled. They just do not even look like the same team that we've seen over the last five or six years on offense. Super Bowl, Brazil, against the Eagles, just not the team we've seen for the last four or five years. I know it's early, but it's just not the same. Third and 25. They're going to run it and try to get out of dodge here. The Giants have a timeout left, so they will take it. They'll get the ball with the punt. Minute 19 to go. Compromised ability to try field goals, but just try to get the ball in their hands. And, Mike, one thing we were double-checking on here, but Bobby Okereke had that football. He did not have control of it, though, long enough for it to be a possession because I was thinking it might have burst down for Kansas City there, but it was not. And now the Giants are in tremendous position. Their problem is they couldn't make a field goal, I don't think, and so they're either touchdown or bust at this point. Matarazzo will kick it. Gunnar Olszewski is back. The Chiefs were in the way, so that'll be interference with the opportunity to catch it. Oshesky blowing up over there on the sideline, and another flag is thrown. We are in bizarro world here tonight. Well, once the ball hit the Kansas City Chiefs player, that was a good decision by Oshesky to go pick it up. But, man, did he pay the price for that decision. Interference with the opportunity to catch the kick. Kicking team number two, a 15-yard penalty. First down. So that'll take the Giants onto the Chiefs' side of midfield. There's the gunner, Joshua Williams, who's down there. And he'll mark the ball all the way at the Chiefs' 41-yard line. Dave Tove, one of the best special teams coaches in the NFL. among the group of Chiefs coaches very frustrated with their team right now. Mike, we have the backup Marcus Bowen at left tackle now for Andrew Thomas. Probably is not too happy unless something happened we don't know about. This is a big moment in the game right here. Thomas with the first 26 snaps. Bow the fifth-round pick out of Purdue came in last week when James Hudson had problems at left tackle. holding up for the moment Moxon hit as he threw incomplete and Bo can only hold up for so long on the pressure from George Karloftis yeah and it's not that Bo doesn't have the ability to stay in front it's these bull rushes he ends up in front and he's in between his quarterback and the rusher but that's not good enough and I tell you they are all over Malik neighbors Right now, I mean they're just not gonna let him beat them out here Gotta find a way to get the ball in his hands. He's so good run after the catch Incomplete as he tried to get it the Darius Slayton, Noel Williams with the coverage flag where they were in contact Personal foul, face mask, defense number 20. A 15-yard penalty, first down. That was the sixth penalty on the Chiefs. Go Williams on the outside, who had some good plays for them a week ago. But here he is right off the snap. Jumps in there and grabs that face mask. Three big penalties here on Kansas City. A lot of the Giants to move to the 26. Again, no timeouts. And a minute, too. Single carry the back, and he'll run it inside. The 23-yard line. Giants like to get on. Quickly, or there's a timeout taken by Kansas City. Interesting. So that was a good call that time by Andy Reid. Well, here we go. Let's take a look at Malik Nabors and why he hasn't been able to touch the ball tonight. Remember, this is a guy who just went crazy a week ago. 167 yards, two touchdowns, but everywhere he's gone, he's had a lot of company in red. They are basically taking those safeties, rolling them over the top, playing single coverage on the backside, which is why you saw Darius Slayton get that deep ball attempt. But they are not going to let league neighbors beat them. This is sort of the old Bill Belichick, make them play left-handed with their star players and playing left-handed and left-footed tonight with their kick. He leads the NFL receiving yards coming into the game, nine for 167 against Dallas with two touchdowns. So Reed took the time and he's got two left. You see if he uses them all here. 81, 81. Second and six for Wilson and the Giants. Pressure coming again. Wilson scanning, flying for neighbors in the end zone. It's intercepted. Undertrown and picked up by Jalen Watson of the Chiefs. And Kansas City gets the ball back. Big time play. You can't blame Russell Wilson for throwing this one. This was straight one-on-one coverage. Jalen Watson on the outside had no help whatsoever. The ball's up a little bit late. They were only on the 20-whatever yard line there, and then it was Watson who out-jumped neighbors. Huge play in the game, and now still enough time because of that timeout to do a little something with it. Exactly. Chiefs had no turnovers forced by the defense coming in. They celebrated two Russell Wilson picks here in this first half. And for Watson, that's his first regular season interception since the rookie year. 99-yarder he had on a Thursday night. Out quick by Mahomes and knocked down, although the man who did that, Burns, came down a little awkwardly, and Brian Burns is shaken up. That's big news. I think he's probably at least the second best player on this defense. He read this all the way. Such a clever player, and you could see he just landed awkwardly. Giants athletic training staff out to look at Burns, who had a couple of sacks in that Washington game, one against Dallas, into the Pro Bowl a couple of times. So good. He really, you know, he was in Carolina for a while. And we didn't do a lot of his games. And I put on the tape, I'm like, wow, I didn't know he was this good. I mean, he's played 100 games in the league. His team has only won 27 of those 100 games. So he hasn't been around to get the notice that you get when you're on a team that people are watching and talking about. Brian Dayball out there as well as everybody's concerned with. Six-foot-five man out of Florida State. But, Mike, what this does now is it probably puts Abdul Carter on the edge, replacing Brian Burns, and then maybe Swayze Bowman back in at the linebacker position. So the sort of gimmicky way that they were able to get those three pass rushers on the field, now taken away from them, that's exactly, I think, what they've done. Yeah, Carter's on the edge, 51. Mahomes has nothing going right now. He is one of his last five for negative two yards and a backwards pass as well. This inside and caught by Kelty. Swung down at the 30-yard line. Timeout taken. As it looks like KC has a first down here. Nope. Let's see. It was a timeout taken. The clock started running again. They got that fixed and put back to 40 seconds. Patrick Mahomes, as we were going to break, was asking, is that a first down? He was told yes. However, with the time to look at it, they're going to bring it back with an expedited look via replay. And they'll reset the chains and all that stuff, so it will be short on the first down. The first down will be third down. Clock operator, please reset to 42 seconds. 43 seconds. Yeah, now more than ever, they're really going to need Dexter Lawrence with Brian Burns sitting over there on the sideline. Dexter Lawrence is one of the largest, most athletic human beings I have ever seen Such a huge guy in there and the way that you disrupt Patrick Mahomes we know it from two Super Bowl losses Get that pressure up the middle run him in to those edge rushers on the outside Run him into Kayvon Thibodeau, run him into Abdul Carter and make one of those kinds of plays. But it starts right up front with number 97. The delay here, Terry, can I bring you in here? So they reset that with replay, right? So is that a 10-second runoff, but the Chiefs' timeout can take care of that? Yes. That's why they have to take their timeout. They take 10 down and then start on the ready for play. Obviously, Kansas City doesn't want to do that, so they took their timeout after all. Right. So the timeout they called is still their own timeout, except they don't have the first down. It's third and short now. That's just a bizarre world here tonight. Third and one coming up. He's going to run for it inside. And with the New Jersey native Pacheco, get that, and Andy Reid will use his final timeout with 40 seconds to go. And that's a great sign for the Giants as Burns comes back. Speaking of pass rushers coming about the Ryder Cup, and cap it off with a massive Sunday nighter, Packers, Cowboys, and the return of Micah Parsons. First and ten, Mahomes on the run. Chase. Carter's got him as he got rid of it. On the edge. It is ruled incomplete. It's past the line of scrimmage. But Abdul Carter with that edge rush. Yeah, because Brian Burns back in the game now, they can use Abdul Carter to spy in here. And then he could go chase Patrick Mahomes, which was what the plan was all along here today. You could see from the very beginning, They really wanted Carter to be that secondary rusher Mahomes 12 of 21 for 100 yards Thibodeau chasing Mahomes gets rid of it And it is incomplete, almost intercepted by Paulson Adebo Who is working underneath Taequann Thornton It will be third and tap Woo, big play that time by Paulson Adebo It looked for a minute like it might have a chance. But first of all, you're going to have Thibodeau coming around and grading the pressure. And the ball may be just a little behind, but great speed that time by Adebo to go get that one and break it up. We're seeing the Giants' pass rush ability factor in to this game. Third and ten. No flag. Mahomes in the middle. It's dropped. By Smith-Schuster, the flag comes in late. Flag from the back judge. It'll be on the Giants. Illegal contact. Defense number 22. Five-yard penalty with an automatic first down. Drew Phillips has had a good half otherwise. And this will keep the drive alive. Take a look at Juwan Taylor on the outside here first. He's got a couple of little quick movements right before the snap of the ball, and who wouldn't, right? You've got Burns on the outside. There's the illegal contact, but not the end of the world because of the clock situation. Chiefs had a timeout. 23 seconds left. Mahomes has time here. Now flushed. Looking for anything. Carter had a hand on him. Didn't get it. Mahomes launches it downfield. in the air, contact and a flag. Mahomes launched it for Hollywood Brown and Phillips grabbed him. And what should have been nothing turns into a 50-plus yard penalty with seven seconds left. I think this throw was 70 yards. Almost. It's close. Pass interference. Defense number 22. First out of the spot of the foul. Here we go again. Two different people are going to get a shot at him. They've got time. They've got pressure. There's 0 for 1. Now you've got your speedster. We've got him now. Abdul Carter. Nope. And he loads up on that one. Maybe not quite 70 yards, but you get the Pythagorean theorem in there. And, you know, maybe the triangle, the whole thing. But that was an unbelievable play. Here we go. Seven seconds. No timeout to the Chiefs. Kareem Hunt in the back. Mahomes sprinting right. Throwing incomplete. With four seconds left. No receiver over there. But Kelty a few yards away from where the throw landed. And the Chiefs will get a Butker field goal attempt. That was big. It really was, especially with the kicking situation the Giants have. Three points are hard to overcome by the Giants. What an ugly first half. Both ways. They're slippery in the case of Mahomes. Butger from 28. And the first half ends with Kansas. City on top by the score of 9-6. There's a little bit of conversation happening at the back end. Everybody gets separated there. Chiefs will get the ball to start this second half. One touchdown of the half scored by the Giants, who missed the extra point. And with KC leading by three, here's Melissa with Andy Reid. 0-2 in the third quarter. set to begin. Mike Tirico, Chris Collinsworth will hear from Melissa Stark momentarily. Jamie Gillen, the punter who has kicked off during the season doing just that line drive. Here goes Nico from Kansas City. He's knocked down for 26 and here's Melissa a moment ago with Brian Dable. Brian, you've held this Chiefs offense to three field goals. How do you continue to keep them out of the end zone in the second half? Yeah, defense we played really good. We kept a couple scrambles there by an elite player and a couple penalties that hurt us, but overall, defensively, we're playing a good football game. Offensively, we've got to take care of the ball and convert on third down. So third downs are what are getting us here. Thanks, Brian. Thanks, most of the time. Giants only one third down conversion in that first half. That long penalty for pass interference at the end of the half. Chiefs get three to take the lead. They get the ball right back. Pacheco carries. Good to see the Giants' Brian Burns out there. Makes the stop after the gain of about three yards. Yeah, and they're doing a few stunts with those two guys out there. You're starting to see some of the possibilities, right, of what this defense can be. They get Burns going one way, they get Carter going the other way, and this is a much better night for Shane Bowen, the defensive coordinator of the New York Giants. He was under some heat the last couple of weeks. Bulls are in fire. He's been in rhythm for the Hollywood Brown. Phillips brings him down. The first down for KC right around the 46 yard line. And one of the ways that you offset that kind of pass rush pressure is to get your quarterback out of the pocket. And Hollywood Brown really has been the answer for Patrick Mahomes when it has not gone well. He's had 15 for 129 this season, by far the leading receiver on this team. Yellow. Come on out. He was hard. Find out for anyone. Find out for anyone. Find out for anyone. Go Blue. Down. Touch. Down gives. But Checo into Giants territory over at the 46-yard line, played his college ball at Rutgers, seventh-round pick back in his home state here tonight. Good game there. Mike, one of the problems you have when you take an edge player like Carter and you put him in off-ball linebackers, great when he's rushing the quarterback, but sometimes just sticking up in there and making those tough tackles. So I think Andy Reid may come back here as long as they're going to play that And say let's just see if we can pound it at these lighter guys Was more of an edge with the Nittany Lions last year like I was saying there's no doubt you want to get him up there You'll be able to make some tackles, but I think Creed Humphrey was right there on him It just I don't know who he was Looking for behind that That was a heck of a play. And it sets up third and three. Usually Kelsey tied for the Chiefs. Mahomes, Kelsey tied for the Chiefs. First down for Travis to the 33. Happy to move the chains. That's when he's good. Watch this move in and out. When he's within 5, 10 yards of the line of scrimmage, those one-step little jukes are just so hard to cover. He almost has a patent on some of those plays, and that looks like the Kansas City Chief's offense. Get set. Ten, ten, ten. Set. Find out if anyone, find out if anyone, find out if anyone. Here at Holmes identifying Carver's a fifth down lineman. How quick, complete, and it'll be about seven or eight yards with Hollywood Brown. Yeah, I thought you were going to predict that play, too. That would have been really good. They're coming after him with some pressure now, too, and Mahomes, they just, now they're settling into something here. Don't you get the feeling they went in? I'm sure Andy at halftime was like, guys, come on. We know how to do this. We've seen people blitzes before. We've seen five-man fronts. Get the ball out of your hands. Some quick, short throws. We're going to be fine. Relax. Fight out 51. Fight out 51. Fight out. He's coming down. He's coming down. Here he comes. And the sleeve of the wrapper, Charles Smith, the rookie running back on a first down. Trying to pull the ball away from him. The fighting continues with the veteran secondary, Javon Holland. First down, Kansas City. Rookie Smith picks it up. And really all Patrick Mahomes was saying there is that if in fact Carter rushes, our offensive line is going to slide and take him. But in reality, it was all a bluff because it was a run play. But you've got to treat the run plays just like you do the pass plays so you make all that noise about what you would do in protection. And it's just the gamesmanship within the game. They're a man, they're a man. Let's go Blue Adams. That's it. Rubble to 22. Pacheco, good misdirection to the left. Pacheco has the first down marker. Closing in on the 11-yard line. You're right, that rhythm in Kansas City just looks like they have settled in here on this opening drive of the third. Well, and that's the other thing you do, Mike, when you've got a team based on speed. You use some misdirection. At times, start going this way and bring it back that way, and you'll see them overrun it a bit. But the Giants defensively are trying to fly to the football and use their speed to their advantage The Giants also spinning some guys in there DJ Davidson in To the eight-yard line Dexter Lawrence In there for the stop among others for the Giants and heading off To the sideline is Dexter Think how many times in games we've done with Kansas City. We're kind of rubbing our hands together right now. Oh, what is Andy Reid going to put together? They go into laboratory. They create these awesome red zone plays. And so far, they just need one to hit. They need to regain a little confidence down in this part of the field. So Mark circle back. He's back in the game. Second and six. Again, now Richard Schuster is stopped. around the five Swayze Bozeman first one there along with Brian Burns who's everywhere for this Giants defense it sets up a big third down six minutes into the quarter Burns is like a freight train he just runs through everybody he's gonna see this screen and come screaming outside here go through the blocker go through his own guy make the tackle his speed shows up everywhere and I would not be surprised at all this is considered four down territory here for Kansas City Chiefs can get a first down to two late 11 of the drive my home fires in zone it is caught with a touchdown by Taekwon Thornton blanketed by Phillips but somehow Mahomes squeezes it in there and Thornton with a touchdown for the Chiefs. Some play by Patrick Mahomes right there. They had a play set up to the right flat. He just didn't like it, and I think he didn't like it because it was that Burns out there, jumped up, sort of got in his way, comes right back and just zips a bullet in there to Thornton. That looked like the Kansas City Chiefs. It's been a long time coming, but that did. 11 play 74 yard drive Butker Packs it with the extra point The Chiefs have a double Digit lead Former New England Patriots Second round pick Taequann Ford His second touch In America's heartland Things a little better in Chiefs Kingdom for the moment after a turbulent First half KC up 10, searching for win number one on the season. That's the bunker. Just a little soccer pop to kick that off to Devin Singletary. With the return across the 30 to the 32-yard line with the Giants take over. All right, let's take a look at our next-gen stats powered by AWS and Cam Scadaboo. He has been something in the first half. The first two weeks, three total missed tackles for us. Fewest in the NFL. Let's get old number 44 out there. Five in the first half. In the first half. And one back flip to go along with it. We didn't see any of those the first two weeks. And Scadaboo, maybe he's the secret sauce here to get the Giants going. Felt like their best back last week in the game in Dallas. He's got it running to the left. Has to bounce it outside. Chased by G. Tranquil. And brought down by Brian Cook from his safety spot. as they track him down. With that left side, Andrew Thomas, the left tackle, not back in there. Marcus Bowe, the rookie, is. Andrew Thomas, right around these 25 snaps or so that you were indicating earlier, Chris, and has not come back in since. And there he is on the sideline. Yep. This is on the other side of the ball. The Kansas City Chiefs defensively have held up their end of the margin. They were tripping last week against the Eagles, and they're doing it again here tonight. Second and ten, Russell Wilson. He's looking to dump and escape, and he will. And the old baseball player slides at the 46-yard line and picks up a giant first down with his legs. Four-man rush. You'll see the gaps. They're always there any time you're going to rush four. and generally you run right at that double-team block. And now we get Jackson Dart into the game. There was a package for Dart last week against Dallas. Ran three snaps. First regular season snap at home for the first-round pick out of Ole Miss. Didn't throw it last week. And to throw here will instead run it. And being about three yards on the carry, Omar Norman Laud, The rookie makes the tackle. As Wilson comes back in. We were around the Giants at practice on Friday. And every time you mention Jackson Dart to someone, everybody's like, ooh. Wait till you see him. They are really excited about him. Well, the funny part was that he basically spent the whole week playing Patrick Mahomes. And everybody was talking about it. All those crazy sidearm throws and body positions and twirl around. He looked a little like Patrick Mahomes doing it. We were watching practice. Wilson back in. Thanks to Chris Jones has him. And Chris Jones did that a lot when Wilson was in Denver. Sacks the quarterback for a loss. There just aren't many guards in all of football that can handle this big guy. He has been their best player on defense for a long time. John Runyon that time. and you know first sack of the year he is almost relieved. He was saying this is a team that's built to have defensive backs get all the sacks. I'm not playing inside. I'm going on the edge. Don't overmanage me. I'm coming after the quarterback. He did. Third and 12. He's there again. Wilton escapes. He'll take off and won't get the first down. It'll be about three yards shy of it. It's Casey territory the 48 fourth and four looks like the Giants will punt this one away Sounds like the Giants will put this one away The only danger is Do the Chiefs have a goal in a Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs have it going on offense like they did on that last drive It won't matter if you give it to him on the 10 or the 50 Gillen to kick the radio is back almost got to kill it brought down after return of five by the gunner are green close to the big specialty Kansas City and a little family gathering quiet oh and two you Don't want to be out there celebrating too much. But Patrick and Brittany's family enjoyed a nice quiet dinner. Run there for three. And speaking of running, here's Mahomes on the run. Here we go. They don't let me draw anymore. They do this Picasso painting on the field for you. Watch all the different places. Looks like a TikTok video or something. You know when your daughter comes in and says, Dad, you want to do a TikTok video with you? Well, they've got it all mapped out. You just run around like that. And great things happen if you're Patrick Mahomes and this play right here really was just absolutely Huge talking about it. Just let him make the catch down there. Yeah Super quick from 22 Touchdown Thornton gets to the 20-something wait wait a minute. Can I just go back to the tick-tock video? Yeah That mapped out for you. You've done that of course I haven't done that but my ticket I haven't I have I didn't see maybe I'm not following you by next weekend You will have a tick tock video. You've got to put one down There's not a chance on planet Earth of that happening. Okay, so I'm still gonna go look for yours So you're saying we have a chance No, not at all. No seriously not for a second. My daughter knows better. She will not embarrass herself like that No bears Mahomes. And it's caught by Noah Gray for the first down to the 37-yard line. So instead of Kelsey on third down to pick it up, it's to Noah Gray, who's had a good game tonight with three grabs. Yeah, and Noah Gray was very good last year. 40 catches, career high, second in receiving touchdowns. So they do have an alternative. They really like Noah Gray. Of course, Kelsey's been all everything around here for ever and a day. But they do have two tight ends capable of doing a lot of what Kelsey does, not all of what Kelsey does. Keeps controlling his third quarter. Kareem Hunt running to the right. A couple, Abdul Carter again involved in the play. Two first-round picks for the Giants, Carter and Jackson Dart. A lot of buzz about what Dart might be, and you're seeing what Carter is with his versatility tonight. Yeah, and really one of the things the Chiefs could use is one of those scat backs, and Rashard Smith is somebody they drafted. He has a little bit of that in him, but they've really got two power backs in Pacheco and Hunt, and they just need a couple of free yards in the running game, just easy plays, right, where your guy makes a miss like Scataboo. Second and eight. And Hunt working inside. And Karen Kay will bring him down. You're already too shy of the first half. That's one of the things that Brett Veach, the GM of the Chiefs, has done so well. Add a veteran right around the trade deadline. Get a guy from somewhere to fill a role that they find that they have after the first half of the season. We'll see if that plays out in the backfield. And what they really need is a little more diversity on the offense. amongst the receivers. Xavier Worthy, Rasheed Rice, when they do get back, it's going to look like a different football team. They just have to be in position to make a late season run when they get those guys back. 30-yard. Mahomes pulls it. Floats it. Thornton out there. Couldn't bring it in. That was incomplete. So a couple options there. Patrick was looking at them, and they're going to keep the offense out for the moment on fourth and a yard. Yeah, that was well set up. That's one of those fake quick screens to the wide receiver on the outside And then Thornton's gonna take off and he was there If the homes could have just put a little air underneath that one and let Thornton adjust to it It's confusion for the Giants and it's forced a timeout So the Chiefs brought the special teams unit out a couple of steps and they came back and some offensive personnel ran on the Giants were in the process of trying to adjust and at best they get a timeout taken by the Giants there is Brett Feach who has been such a partner with Andy Reid in this for many years first nine years in Philadelphia does in Kansas City and as part of this group Chris that has just built this incredible sustained excellence you kind of micromanage a tough start to pull back How could you remember five of the last six Super Bowls? Unprecedented run this team is on. It really is, and Beach deserves a lot of that credit. He does so much of the work. Of course, Andy's always the final decision maker in anything that they do. But finding those last pieces of the puzzle to allow you to go on those deep Super Bowl runs, those guys put in unbelievable hours. So now they bring the punch unit on Ten to twenty and that is where this defense do a job on Wilson To the 41 Just a quick check down, but for Giants fans, okay, it's a frustrating year. We haven't won a game. We're behind in this game. But let's get into Scadaboo and just have him stick his helmet right in the belt of Watson. And they're good. Okay, we're good. We got our money's worth. And Theo Johnson will tell us that they are very high on Johnson's future, as you see there. Johnson runs it right towards that first down marker on the other side of midfield. And it is a giant first down, second year man out of Penn State. As we get to the end of the third quarter, only points. A Chiefs touchdown. Kansas City looking for win one on top of the Giants. Tell everyone watching that next weekend. That is one of the great events of any sport. Can't wait for it coming up this weekend. Wilson chased out first down. Firing sideline back shoulder. Lay with those two feet inbounds. However, a hat comes from the official, usually indicates that Wandale Robinson was out and back in. A lot of conversation here on what happened. Yep. Both out. Back in. First to touch. To a nice play, trying to leave the feet in there with the evidence that his feet were inbounds. but uh-uh. Illegal touching. Offense number 17. The receiver was first to touch the pass after having been out of bounds. Lost it down at the spot of the snap. Second down. And that's really what they've been reduced to here tonight. They are just basically taking away Malik neighbors, and every time Russell Wilson gets impatient and tries to go there, all of a sudden he ends up with one intercepted. So if the Giants are going to make a comeback here, it's probably Darius Slayton, it's probably Wondell Robinson, Scadaboo, Theo Johnson, because they just have been unable to get neighbors even started. He has no catches. The Giants receivers in total have two catches here through three quarters at a play. He got them. He knows they're blitzing, but now it looks like Bolton checked out of it. One game. They only bring four. The throw is complete for a short game, and that's the first time for neighbors. And the anti-fans are so happy to see their terrific receiver finally get one in his hands. Yeah, by the time that Russell Wilson got that audible out, then you had already seen Nick Bolton check. They're blitzing. There's no question. Watch. And now they're going to drop back out of there, which is going to give a little space over here to neighbors, which he hasn't had all night. Once you cross the 50, you can expect pressure out of the Chiefs. Wilson taking his shot. Deepening coverage for neighbors. And it's broken up and incomplete. And Ryan Cook comes down, grabbing his head. Neighbors also shaken up as well as they were both airborne trying to go up and get it. And that is a big issue right there for the New York Giants. Two important players for each team. Cook the safety, Neighbors the receiver. Here it is. Did Cook get kicked by Neighbors accidentally? He went to grab the back of his head. Neighbors went to grab his shoulder. Good to see Neighbors getting up for the Giants. Athletic training staff for the Chiefs continues to look at their starting safety, Brian Cook. Field with the athletic training staff so they look at both of the injured players and the Giants have their offense out there down 10 a minute into the fourth and going for it on fourth and a half dozen. Yeah, Brian Cook's been one of their best players and replaced now by Roland Wallace who also had the pick. 30, around the 35-yard line. Jay Picks, the other safety, dropping back. Wilson throws inside, complete. Getting up to catch and losing the ball with Robinson. Into the hands of Tamari Connor. Trent McDuffie got a hand on it. It's now being called an incomplete pass. Or they say he's down first. Let's see. The official has made two signals from the side as he comes in. We also have a penalty flag down at the 42-yard line. Chiefs offense retreating from out by the numbers back to their own sideline. Pass interference. Defense number 22. First down on the spot of the foul. On Trent McDuffie and the Giants come up with a fourth down conversion. Had to have it. And McDuffie clearly has been the dominant player in the secondary for this Chiefs team. But right now for the New York Giants, this is just one of those moments, right? They got plenty of time in this game They just need to go down and put some points on the board They have it At this point Russell Wilson has lost his patience a few times taken a few deep shots that really should not have been taken and they're staying in this too deep safety look. So the answer should be running the football and short complete passes. Karloftis off the edges, passed. Wilson has to check it down. It is going to move forward. Ford does it in a first down to the 28 yard line. He's either proud every time he touches the ball. They get to the edge of their seat and start to cheer. Yeah, I was afraid Russell was going to throw that one deep down there. Really, he desperately wants to. It's what he does best, playing the quarterback position. And then he finally just checks it down. But Scadaboo's been so good running after the catch, there's nothing wrong with that. That guy's picking up extra yardage every time he touches the ball. He's 91 of the Giants, 181. This is popped down to Chris Manhurst, the tight end. A touch for him to the 21-yard line. Guy born in the Bronx, played his college football at Canisius, and now Jackson Dart will come in the game for the Giants. And so far we have only seen him running. We have not seen him throw the ball. You watch him in preseason, probably his strength were the really quick reads and get the ball out of his hands. See if this is his first pass as a pro. Second and three. Dart gives Scadaboo runs to the 11th first-down Giants. Wilson stays on the sideline. And maybe a little bit of that read option is going to help Because what we know is that Jackson Dart is very efficient running that, and he also has the possibility of running the ball, which may be creating some room inside for Scadaboo. So they have to defend Dart as well. 12, it's the game. Scadaboo inside. Three yards to the nine-yard line. Wilkes in takes a few steps off the sideline, comes in. Dart heads out. So here's what I'm talking about. Here's the Reed guy who can't go flying inside because Dart might take off that way. He does make the tackle, but not until he's five or six yards down the field. And I don't think Russell Wilson presents that same threat. Neighbors back in. Making sure everybody knows he's there. From the nine, Wilson. on the little throws underneath. It is caught by Slayton. He stops at the sixth. The Giants will have third down and four for the first down, six for the touchdown, and a Chief is injured back near the line of scrimmage. Charles O'Menohue, the defensive lineman. Mike Dana out of the lineup tonight, so more action for O'Metohue, who was out for a good part of 2024's start after entering his ACL in the AFC Championship game in 23. Oh, Scadaboo about took his ribs apart. Wow. Kind of interesting Chris you look at the draft class for the Giants right we've seen Abdul Carter on defense Scadaboo bow is in there playing left tackle dart comes in gives you a little bit there are other rookies contributing it's There's some young talent here and they're giving this team an energy that was missing The Giants last year and you're seeing it in different ways tonight And you're also feeling it from the crowd every time they take Jackson dart out of the game, right? It was third and fourth for the Giants here four minutes into the fourth quarter Remember the Giants have field goal issues with Graham can know Trying to escape after the fake and George Carlos this is there to get up and on fourth down It's like Giants are going to Field goal, I believe. Yes, they are. They're going to try field goal with Gano. So we watched Gano come out to try field goals at halftime while the band was playing, and then a little bit after that, it was a marching band at halftime. He kicked them. They were not very high. They didn't go very far, and he was in a ton of discomfort after each kick. But this is more of a half wedge here. Yes, but that's all he could do. Yeah. From 25 yards. Oh, you can see him double over after he kicked it. But it is good. And the Giants are within one score. The 38-year-old, his 205th NFL game. Respect from his teammates for gutting it out. Watch him after he kicks this. Oh, it hurt. But it is good. Providing information that they provide me. Remedio in return. It's hit hard. at the 23-yard line. All right, let's take a look at our 4K Sky Camp delivered by Walmart Plus. And ordinarily, it's Dexter Lawrence who's delivering big hits on the quarterback, but not against the Kansas City Chiefs. They have had him bottled up all night long with double teams and running at him and just hasn't really had a chance to get jump-started at all. He had an issue with his elbow last year, and then you see the two big guys that pass him, Trey Smith, Creed Humphrey, moving them off the ball there. Inside run for Pacheco, 27-yard line. That's through Lawrence. Patrick Mahomes was talking about last night how he can change the game so much. His number's here tonight, Melissa. Yeah, and we've been watching him down here. Starting early in the third quarter, he had a conversation with the athletic trainer and the team doctor. Didn't go in the medical tent, but they were massaging his left elbow and forearm, testing the strength. He was grimacing in pain, and Chris mentioned it. It's worth noting he dislocated that same elbow last year and missed the final five games of the season. On the sideline for the moment, second and six, Mahomes. Chase throws it away as Kayvon Thibodeau was bringing the pressure. Set a big third down for this Giants defense, and Lawrence back in. Man, these guys close fast. Don't they watch Thibodeau coming off the edge there? And Juwan Taylor tried to get his speed to get out there on him and Thibodeau just blew right past him He looks terrific to me this year Big big play in the game right here. The Giants have a chance they can make this stop Motion home retreated Put it out, but it's caught for the first down. Two in the area. Taequann Thornton comes up with his second big grab of this second half. Oh, my goodness. Patrick Mahomes, you're talking about taking one for the club. Watch the shot that Mahomes takes at the end of this one. Abdul Carter's going to loop around, but that was sexy dexy, I do believe. And Taequann Thornton now has come up with multiple big plays. Look at that shot. Multiple big plays for the Kansas City Chiefs the last couple of weeks. Swing it out to the rookie for Shard Smith trying to turn the corner. Speed element you were talking about, Chris. Just a different look out of those running backs. Takes it to the Giants 44, gain of eight, with eight and a half left in regulation. Yeah, I tried to set up Andy Reid a little bit to say, yeah, could somebody like Smith give you some cheap yards, right, in the passing game, whatever. And he goes, yeah, we're not playing them all the time. They're not big enough for that. We've got big guys for that. Speaking of big guys, Chris Jones going to get a break before their defense has to go back and try to close the game out. Chiefs trying to get win one. The Holmes quick one. Hollywood Brown 35. And we'll pull it in and get a Chiefs first down. And one of the reasons that the Giants have been able to send so much pressure after Mahomes is they've been playing a lot of man coverage on the back end. And sometimes you get confused and you see somebody in the secondary giving up a pass, that time a Debo. But these guys have been under a ton of pressure because they have no choice. You have to get hits on Patrick Mahomes to beat these guys. Check out. Right low pick here. Speaking of which, Robbie O'Carrike, seventh-year man out of Stanford when he was with the Colts at the start of his career, big tackler. And same has been true since he's been with the Giants. 16 tackles he had in week one, and you can see this guy reads it so fast. And really, you might as well throw him into that speed category, you know, because a lot of times he's right around the line of scrimmage, and oftentimes he's either the fourth or fifth or sixth blitzer on a play. Seven to go. Mahomes protected, lofting it. Thornton again, grab it in. Sliding to the goal line for the touchdown. Through the touchdown as Thornton able to catch it, slide across, so we'll have to look at a few things. the ball was sliding around as he caught it it sort of went up on his shoulder pads let's take a look oh i think that's going to be called incomplete there catches it knees come down but he's got to survive the ground quote unquote in that situation your assistance to really need incomplete pass third down And another bonus for video assistance. Yeah, that was one of those chance plays on defense. They rushed everybody. We were talking about sometimes they bring O'Kara Kay right in there, which means now you're purely one-on-one on the outside with a guy that can really run in Thornton. He did everything right, just couldn't survive the ground. That's so much harder than it sounds. Giants a little confusion here this is third and ten field goal is 53 yards Giants one want to stop them to want to try to get a loss of yardage to make it a much longer field goal for Butker Holmes putting it up for grabs again for Thornton that time I'm telling you, that catch is within about three feet of where he almost made the one before that. Watch the turn and the focus, and he squeezed that one. That is fantastic. And you know, Thornton had another one last week. Could have been an additional 50-yard touchdown. and Patrick Mahomes just missed him. So this guy now is starting to take the role that Xavier Worthy was so good at, which is stretch that defense big time. Career high for the former Patriots. First thing going inside. Second effort for the touchdown for Kareem Hunt. Almost like he was going to lose the ball, had to stop and able to grab it, get inside that Giants defense, and put the Chiefs up 13. A late flag that flew. Perhaps off the celebration, the continued policing of unsportsmanlike conduct that the players were instructed about. And this is one of the things they were told they can't do, the throat slash. The touchdown will count after the play. Unfortunately like conduct. Offense number 29. That penalty will be enforced on the try. That's number 29's first in spots with like conduct foul towards potential disqualification. Yep, two and you're gone, and that will push the extra point back to a 48-yard attempt for Harrison Butker. Hunt, his second stint with the Chiefs. now 30 years old at his first rushing touchdown of this season. The Giants had a couple of third downs, a couple of opportunities to get the Chiefs off the field with Taequann Thornton's magic. And Mahomes just continuing to put the ball in the right spot. Get the job done. From 48 yards for one point. And Harrison Butker's night and struggles continue. That is four missed kicks here for Butker in the first three games. And the penalty by Hunt. We mentioned John Mara, the longtime president and CEO of this team. Brian Dayball and Joe Shane. Good draft. A lot of young players here. But results are needed. And the Giants just have no home field advantage right now. Turn by Singletary takes the cross 35 to the 37-yard line. And, you know, Chris, you're going to get early in the season, right? You saw the excitement with Russell Wilson. The question is, what happens over the next three, four, five weeks? Because if you drafted a first-round quarterback, what do you always say to me? Yeah, you drafted him for the coach that's going to take your place. And, you know, that's the way it is. And I'm sure that the Giants and Brian Daywell would love to see Jackson Dart. We've seen him a couple times. Then they take him out. as they get a couple runs going down, the read option stuff working, and you could hear the crowd kind of murmuring and going, is this what we want or not? And it's just tough. You know, it's tough on Russell Wilson. It's tough on Jackson Dart, and they don't want to put him in there too soon. But at some point, you also drafted him in the first round for a reason, and you're sitting there staring at 0-3 right now, and that day is coming. There's just no way around it unless things get turned around in a big-time hurry. Scatterboog for the first down. He's got about 125 scrimmage yards. He's had a good night here tonight. Melissa? Yeah, Mike, continuing that conversation, I talked to Eli Manning, who knows very well what it's like to be a rookie and sit behind a veteran quarterback and learn. He sat behind Kurt Warner for half of his rookie season. He told me he believes this is the perfect situation for Jackson Dart, that he's able to take some time and learn from Ross. who got sacked there by George Karloftis back at midfield for a loss of five yards. And we did mention it briefly earlier. Look, Patrick Mahomes is the guy in the National Football League. Three Super Bowls and all that he's done in his now seven-plus years as the starting quarterback. He didn't play until the last week of his rookie season, and everybody around the Chiefs tells you how valuable that was for his growth. He moves into the sideline shot here, complete to the 35-yard line. Very close to a first down for Darius Slayton. Jalen Watson the tackle. And I'm going to try to say this diplomatically, but there is a level of excitement inside that building that surrounds Jackson Dart that's not going away either. Flag down. Pass to sleep for three. It's unmistakable, and it's not just one or two people. It's everyone who you mentioned his name to, you know, wow. Yeah, and teammates, the connection. He's like one of the guys right away, and he's having fun on the scout team. And you can tell he's a guy that just loves football. Illegal shift. Offense number 18. Five-yard penalty. Replayed. First down. But it does make sense, doesn't it, to wait and let him be ready? Because I thought Mike Kafka, ironically enough, drafted by Andy Reid, worked with Andy Reid as a coach. I thought he gave us real good perspective on the rookie quarterback. I cast is the offensive coordinator from the Giants. Yeah, and perspective is great unless you're in New York City. And that lasts about 15 seconds. From the 40, Wilson trying to get out of there. Does as he throws, complete to Daniel Bellinger. The tight end gets about 5 yards, 34-yard line, 4.15 to go. And the Kansas City Chiefs defense is fantastic. and their early schedule is really, really tough. So at what point do you want to put in a Jackson guard, even if you did want to put him in? You don't want to put him in and have him get beat up and lose by 20 points and all that sort of stuff. So there comes a point in the season where you pick a soft spot, you get him in, you try and make it all look good, but going against Steve Spagnuolo in this defense is hard for the best of the quarterbacks in the National Football League. Very difficult to crack this code. It's down 13, trying to stay alive with a big play here. The pass from neighbors. Not close and incomplete. Noel Williams, rookie at a Cal, third rounder, had the coverage for KC. But it was, you know, it was interesting for me. Were they going to continue to play that soft coverage? And clearly it frustrated Russell Wilson. He had that 40-point game or whatever it was the other day against Dallas. They were bombs away, and everybody was making plays. Malik Nabors here and there. And that guy, there was no way Steve Spagnuolo was going to let Malik Nabors beat him. And it frustrated Russell Wilson, and the other guys weren't good enough to pick up the slack and carry the load. Fourth and five from Wilson. Throwing in the middle. It is come on to a big hit. Wanda Robinson makes some kind of catch. Inside the five with 3.22 to go. Giants have a couple of timeouts as they hope to score on this side of the two-minute warning. Get the ball back. Wiltzhead just gets rid of it with nothing open. Throws it up the tunnel. 3.10 left. It's a very brave catch going down the field because you will see he's going to take a shot. That was Jabari Connor who was chasing him down the field and great throw by Russell Wilson. Zip it right in over the top of the coverage. And you need a receiver, even your smallest receiver, to have the guts to make that play. Chris, they did call it. Check it out. I chuckled before you started the replay because Andy Reid was starting to walk out to the official going, Come on, he truly did throw it up the tunnel. And able to get the flag you'll see there is a receiver to the left side there, but There's the receiver. There's the tunnel It's a guy in a scatter blue jersey 44 so he thought he was eligible But apparently not look like Eli the other thing halftime. I mean scataboo doesn't know Jurassic office 63 cameras here He's working his phone second and goal Design run Wilson Not met with the approval of the paid customers It's tough Russell came in here tonight leading the league in passing yards Yes he did. More big plays than anybody He's getting booed. That's what happens when you draft the first round quarterback 3rd and goal. Just putting it up for grass. 4th and goal. Andy Reid asking again. The camera well over there. Is where the ball ended up. No intentional grounding. And there is Steve Spagnuolo. As we say, Chris, with a lot of young players over the last couple of years, what he has done with his Kansas City defense, It's really one of the great jobs by a coordinator. Yeah, and I think Andy Reid gave a nod when he did not go for it on fourth and two about midfield like he did last time, saying, I know my defense can win the game from here. Fourth and goal. Wilkes in. Chiefs fall. Yeah, that about sums it up. Giants get down in the red zone. Do not even threaten. And the Chiefs will take over up 13. A career loan for neighbors if that doesn't change. He's had at least four catches in every game that he has played. 25, couple of timeouts. Giants take their first here after the run by Kareem Hunt. You know, and the Giants ran the ball fairly well tonight, but they should have because of the defense that was being played with those deep safeties to take away neighbors. And they didn't run it well enough, consistently enough, all the way down the field to be able to make the difference and score the touchdowns they needed. But, you know, the Giants' defense played pretty well tonight. They did okay and hung in there with Patrick Mahomes. But in the end, the Giants just can't put offense and defense together. They just can't do it. Ticks. Heavy start to the season for KC. The carry, the timeout. At some point, he's going to be in. I mean, let's not panic over it. You know he's going to play. But I do think there's something to and it'll be it won't just be Brian Dable's decision. It'll be management It'll be the general manager at some point that move will be made this year and They're gonna wait till they think he's ready and that puts a lot of pressure on Brandon Timeouts for homes looking to throw and throwing it Intercepted by Paulson a depot Wow. That was like, okay, we're going to go for the freebie here and go over the top. But when that thing is at all covered in this game, you throw it. Well, you can't throw it in the front row. I know now you can't do that anymore. That used to be fine, but you can't do that. But you definitely throw that somewhere other than there. Wow. They gave the Giants a chance with that one. Yeah, sure did. Try to come after this punch Arisa will kick it Moshevsky back deep to receive He's got in there 53 on the kick Moshevsky Turns it to the 39-yard line With 2.04 to go Boy, all the special team plays As we saw this week, Chris, we almost saw another one. Carter off the edge, pressure in the middle. Big part, Bo Collins, 81, was off the edge. I was more surprised to see that ball come out of there. Man, that was close. And that would have bounced right in the end zone, and who knows what would have happened out of that. Speasy Bozeman coming through the middle. Some of those kick blocks that we saw today, What a wild, wild insight. 45-minute stretch of football in the old proverbial witching hour. What do they call it? Bad beats? There were some bad beats today, too. All start. Offense number 76. Five-yard penalty. Still first down. John Runyon Jr. This has had a long time in the league. 14-year career. served in Congress. Vice President of Rules Administration. Never once he pins. They had to send a letter to his son, finding his son. Neighbors finally gets a second catch. Takes a big stick as well from Noel Williams. As that play gets us to two-minute warning. Chiefs up 13, and we turn our attention to the big one. The soap opera got a little bigger this time around, though. Sure did. A bunch of Micah Parsons as they played against Cleveland today. And then stunning finish with the Browns coming back at the end. Hunter Schmidt hitting the game-winning field goal for Cleveland. They knocked off the Packers for Scadaboo. Incomplete. He got tagged along the sideline by Noel Williams. That's a rookie corner who we've called his name a bunch, and I think he's one of the guys we'll see as the season goes on. Well, it was interesting talking to Steve Spagnuolo, and he was saying, you know, I really believe in getting those guys in the game. And so they were going to play some guys that ordinarily wouldn't play so much. And Noel Williams won at the top of the list. Omar Norman Lott, another one. Ashton Jalani, another one. But they want them ready for when they have to play when somebody gets hurt. 36, it's incomplete. A little miscommunication. and the Giants receiver turned around. So for as good as the Giants offense looked last week, this week has left a lot to be desired. Jalen Watson almost got his second tonight, and that was a cheapie. Here comes the feeding frenzy. This is when defensive linemen, it doesn't matter when they happen in games, sacks or sacks, Chris Jones out here on the outside, and I was thinking a little bonus money right now Marcus bow the fifth round they're out of Purdue It'll be a game of two yards technically on a run and that will be that And the Giants will fall to oh and three and and the Chiefs will get on the board and get their first win of the season. Yeah, two bad offensive performances by the Giants, one bad defensive performance, and for Andy Reid, a sigh of relief, right? I mean, they just needed a win. There was a path for the New York Giants to win this football game tonight. There really was, and the struggles early on in that first half for the Kansas City Chiefs, but they came out. I don't know what Andy said or did at halftime. They came out that first drive, and it was like a magic wand was waved, and it was like, oh, the Chiefs are back. Somebody turned on the light here, and then all of a sudden, everything was fine. The crispness to it, right? Misdirection, cute passes were working, all that stuff. Four catches for Kelsey, only 26 yards. I love when Melissa asked Andy Reid at halftime about, you know, frustration on the sidelines and all that stuff. And he's like, good. That's what I love about Andy Reid. He's like, he gets it. You know, he's engaged with his guys after all these years and all these wins. Yeah, he can stir the pot a little bit, too. He was initiating some of that. That wasn't all Travis Kelsey. And I think that he plays those emotions. I really do with this team. You know, he's a great guy. He's fun. He tells great stories. But there's another side of Andy Reid. And there's one that, and you don't mess around with that guy. He's got a bunch of Super Bowl rings on his finger for a reason. I thought the sit-down Jason Garrett had with Andy that we saw in football night tonight was great, wasn't it? It was, and that's the conversations you have with Andy Reid. It's not long answers, and sometimes we joke about it. You've got to go back in and dig into those answers and reread them and go, oh, he dropped a little nugget in there, man. Yeah, yeah. well they dig in and get win one on the season as the Giants fall to 0 and 3 22 9 final numbers here in this one right table with Giants head coach So KC will get ready for the Ravens and play the Lions tomorrow night to wrap up week three of the NFL season. The Giants will have a challenge.
