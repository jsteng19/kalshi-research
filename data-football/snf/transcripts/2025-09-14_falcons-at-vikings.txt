 For the Vikings and back deep for the Falcons, it'll be D. Alford and the rookie Nathan Carter out of Michigan State. Set to go here in Minnesota. Alford kicking all the way to the end zone. And taking the knees off to the Falcons. We'll get it at the 35, and here they are. Michael Penix, Washington. B. John Robinson, Texas. Drake, London, USC. Ray McLeod III, Clemson. Darna Mooney, 2-0. Kyle Pitts, Willard. Jake Matthews, Texas A&M. Matthew Bergeron, Syracuse. Ryan Neusel, App State. Chris Lindstrom, Boston College. Elijah Wilkinson, UMass Amherst. And that right tackle spot, one will watch. They lost Caleb McGarry. Good right tackle. Big physical guy. He was injured in the preseason. He has been a starter on that side the last six years. Pennix in Atlanta begin at the 35. Adam Pistol, B. John Robinson running left through a tackle. Robinson accelerating, and there goes Robinson. Trapped down from behind at the 40 by Theo Jackson, but a big game right out of the gate for the star back for the Falcons. This is it. This is their play. This outside zone play, all the linemen come down the line, and, Mike, they were terrible running the football a week ago, and it really cost them a game. They have to get B. John Robinson, one of the absolute best backs in the National Football League. Shook off that tackle and hit him with a big play early. 25 yards, one more than he had all game against Tampa last Sunday. He's got it again. He'll try it to the right, and he's got it again. Robinson into the secondary. 16 more yards. Terrific start on the ground. Falcons said they were angry that they didn't run it. Boy, they're showing it. Nice block that time by Elijah Wilkinson. A lot of eyeballs on him. He was the one that a lot of people said, all right, you don't have Caleb McGarry, you can't run the football. And basically everybody I talked to from the Falcons this week said completely on all of us. We were terrible. We made mistakes we'd never made. And right off the bat, bang, bang, two big runs. Darnell Mooney back in the lineup. He's the motion man. run three for Robinson. Still a good one inside the 20 to the 18-yard line. So that will make it a bit easier for Michael Penix Jr. Fourth quarterback, eighth player taken in the 2024 draft. In the four injury-impacted seasons at Indiana, then two super seasons out of Seattle, the University of Washington losing to McCarthy, as I mentioned, in the championship game. And you saw those week one numbers. Everybody from the Falcons very happy with the way played last week against him outside that time slips down to the ground by Jonathan Allen the new addition to that defensive front for the Vikings or as the defensive coordinator he's not going to get run over all night long here come the linebackers on a run That's exactly what it is that we have seen consistently throughout the career of B. John Robinson first guy rarely gets him on the ground. You need a lot of bodies around everybody on this defense acknowledge that. After those in DPS play clock running down. Timeout Atlanta. So it's third down against this Minnesota defense, and here they are. Jonathan Grenard, Hiram High School. Jonathan Allen, Alabama. Jalen Redmond, Oklahoma. Javon Hargrave, South Carolina State. Thomas Turner, Alabama. Eric Wilson, Cincinnati. Ivan Page Jr., Cincinnati. Byron Murphy, U-Dub. Theo Jackson, Tennessee. Joshua Metellus, Charles W. Plannett. Isaiah Rogers, Blake High School. And Chris could be watching close tonight what Brian Flores does because he's missing people at each level. Andrew Van Ginkle, their edge rusher, out. Blake Cash, the quarterback of the defense, out on injured reserve. Veteran safety Harrison Smith hasn't played yet this season, missing his second straight game. Showing a pressure look early here. Third and four. Some support for that pressure in the middle. Penix asking for it. The flag is down. Ball starts off the middle setting. You can hear when the microphone is open from our referee, Adrian Hill, how loud it is on the field. That was the number one concern of offensive coordinator Zach Robinson was just execution. Get to the line of scrimmage. If you have to audible what you're going to have to do tonight because of the very nature of this Vikings defense with Brian Flores, then you've got to get it done, but you have to do it cleanly. Now they're backed up after a great start to the drive. Third nut. Vikings bring four. Panics protected. Throws his tight end Kyle Pitts. Tackled by Josh Metellus. Yard and a half shy of the first down. Let's see what they'll do on fourth. And about one. No move for the field goal unit just yet. And the Falcons will line up to go for it. Yeah, and I believe in to the game comes Charlie Warner. He is their blocking tight end and with the way they started running the football in this game You're excited about this opportunity But you're gonna see the same response out of the big guys here from the Vikings first You could see Penix is having trouble getting the play in play clock running down late again Down at three as they break the huddle They'll get this one off The noise, the noise, the noise. Mike, the hard part is on those fourth down decisions, there's always a bit of hesitation. You've got to make the decision on the sideline. You've got to run to the far end of the field. And they just didn't execute that as a team that time. That wasn't just on Michael Penix. Decision about Youngway Koo, the kicker. They didn't cut him. He's inactive tonight. Parker Romo signed this week. Is the kicker. He kicked four games for the Vikings last year. From 38 yards. That's leaving left, but just inside the upright. And good. So Parker Romo, back in a place where he kicked last year. As the Falcons were able to get three out of that opening drive. Last year, start number one Monday night in Chicago. His first home start here tonight. Though we mentioned Youngway Koo is inactive for this game. Bradley Pinion, the punter, is going to be kicking off for the Falcons. And Miles Price, the rookie, brings it out for the Vikings. And he stopped right around the 27-yard line. And that's where the Minnesota offense takes over. J.J. McCarthy, Michigan. Aaron Jones, Sr., El Paso, Texas. Justin Jefferson, LSU. Jay Winona, Michigan State. Adam Thielen, Minnesota State Mankato. T.J. Hawkinson, Iowa. Justin School, Vanderbilt. Donovan Jackson, The Ohio State University. Ryan Kelly, Alabama. Will Fries, Penn State. Brian O'Neill, Pitt. So the other tackle, Christian Darasaw is usually the guy in there instead of Justin School, but Darasaw on his way back from the torn ACL and MCL last October. Getting close, but school starts. Number 27, McCarthy. First throw, sideline is ruled. A catch on that sideline for Jalen Naylor. And only a gain of a couple. So McCarthy, two picks after Penix, 10th overall. That's number five of the six quarterbacks taken in the first round. That knee injury happened in the preseason opener last year. Sat out the whole year, but really kept working. Stayed very active and around this team. And takes over as the starter here this season. We're through. Cut. Eddie. What's the hot hot? Coming, coming. We're about to cut. And Aaron Jones is the back. They'll run to the right. Right into his lineman. Taken down by Devine Diablo. Chris looked very good for the Falcons defense in their game against the Bucs last week. Yeah, he really did. And he's given them a second blitz element. They have a very good blitzing linebacker in Caden Ellis. that we saw the speed and athleticism. And one of the things that Jeff Ulbrich, the defensive coordinator who has spent a good bit of time in San Francisco, that whole idea of a former safety converted to a linebacker he loves, it just gives him so many options with blitz possibilities. Here we go, here we go. Third and seven. McCarthy back to the air. Steps up. Going to take off. And stretches as he's tackled by Jesse Bates. Let's see where the mark comes. Very close to that first down. Right around the 37-yard line. That's fourth down. Like the knee may have hit just prior. Vikings will jump the ball here on fourth down. They're going to go for it McCarthy Surge through and get a push from Jones See what they're going to do here with the mark Did not feel like the pile was moving Past the line of scrimmage Patriot Hill the referee in for a peek Where it's marked it is short And it is Falcons ball at the Vikings 36-yard line. Looks like Caden Ellis got right underneath him and would not let him go. At the end of this play, the snap was bobbled. You will see it was McCarthy pumping his legs here. He's still trying to move, but because he never got the snap, which happens all the time on center sneaks because of the fact that center has to get down so low to give you an opportunity. The snap is never the same as it is on a regular down the distance. It's one of the really impressive things about Philadelphia that they do it so well and never mess that up. Minnesota had the least fourth down attempts and conversions last year. They go for it here, don't get it. Great opportunity for the Falcons at the Vikings 36. After the hot first drive, right back to Robinson. With a shoulder into the corner, Byron Murphy. Nice pickup on first down of six yards. I love watching B. John Robinson bounce these things to the outside. Watch him. He's going to hit up in that hole and then just the speed to outrun everybody to the edge. So it doesn't look like much. It looks like okay, but it was going to be no gain. And just the speed alone allowed him to come up and pick up good yardage there of about six yards. Number eight overall pick in that 2023 draft. Third in the league in rushing yards last year. Second and four. Look out. Panics gets rid of it. Rule the catch for the moment. And on the move, Robinson. Rule the first down at the 20. You can see Dallas Turner, the defensive lineman, ask if it touched the ground. Rule no at a first down. So look at all the bodies over here. Why are they doing that? They want a one-on-one right here with their best player, Jonathan Bernard. And he almost got there. It was a good thing that Penix in fact wasn't Interesting Kevin O'Connell through his flag the play clock was right at 20 when Adrian Hill opened his mic They try to get the replay assist in those within that 20 second window if it's clear and obvious It was both and it's incomplete complete. That's a good job by the replay booth of being on top of it. It's a really good addition in the National Football League. I know it's an unbelievable amount of pressure and technology to get it done, but man, it just makes the game so much cleaner. The ball mark in the right spot here. And the correct down Down box is showing fourth down right now. It should be third down And the ball should be up at the 30-yard line after the Robinson run into Murphy That's the sorting that is happening right now where he Morris is making sure It's in the right spot The game clock right as well We saw Michael Penix pick up some big first downs and touchdowns a week ago with his legs, something we didn't always see in the past. It was a little surprise to this Vikings defense. We're getting all the officials back in their position to run this play. Clock is properly set at 8.34, and it's 3rd and 3rd. Panics, fires, and it's caught inside for the first down. To the 15-yard line, to his tight end. Getting Kyle Pitts going is part of the story of this season. First game in a quarter, they are. Against Joshua Metellus on the outside, the safety coming down. But I tell you, if this Kyle Pitts can turn into what everybody thought he was going to be when he got drafted. He had seven catches for 59 yards a week ago. He and Drake London, really the majority of that passing offense. But he has just added a layer of patience. He's becoming more of a pro. He picked up his fifth-year option this year. And I think the relationship he has with Pennix playing a lot of golf has helped down-throw it better. Back in the red zone to the 15-yard line. Pennix out to Robinson. John Robinson did such a good job as a receiver last week against the Buccaneers, and we're seeing that theme continue here tonight. We saw him on a third play of the game last time and go for about 50 yards with a little swing pass, and he really is the weapon out there. He's not just a runner, but when you can line him up on a lineback or a safety as they did in that case right there, it's almost unfair to expect them to stop a pass completion. He's been good down in this area. 24 touchdowns in the first 35 games of Robinson's career. Second and five. Pressure coming. And it throws. It is Robinson can't hang on. Isaiah Rogers lurking in coverage. We'll have another third down coming up. See where they flanked B. John Robinson out there that time. That's a little bit of the Christian McCaffrey treatment. right there bring him out in a little bit of space and get the one-on-one out there let's see if they come back to it hard you have to look just to get a play call that's heard by everyone in the huddle with all the noise here and then you get so many gimmicky things at the line of scrimmage with the Vikings you don't have enough time to change Panics, escaping, keeping his head up and he fires towards the end zone, incomplete. Darnell Mooney, the receiver he was trying to get it to. After being stopped on fourth down, he'll come back for another Parker Romo field goal opportunity. Chris, we watched this when we went to the prior break. It's not reviewable when it goes above the uprights. But that was the correct call because the ball has to be inside the outside edge of the goalpost. The entire ball. Yes. All of it. Look how happy Terry is. We finally got it right. Terry McCauley, our rules analyst, joining us. 29-yard field goal now for Parker Romo. And so he is 2-for-2. after winning the job during the competition with Young-Waiku during practice this week for the Falcons. We'll leave McCarthy in the Bikes. 6-0. Fourth down was stopped, so it is 6-0. Chris, it's been interesting watching the kickoffs and hearing people talk about it around the league. This has become a very significant play now with the rules adjustment. And we saw it all day today. Big kick returns, turning games around. One good thing, I think it took a little pressure off those kickers to have to bang it out of the end zone all the time and mess up their regular kicking motion. Interesting point. Miles Price going over to get it. There's a yard in the end zone, still choosing to bring it out. Nice move there by Price. The flag is down as he comes down at the 23-yard line. It's covered by Mike Ford, Jr. of the Falcons. And here's the call. During the return, holding against the receiving team, number 59. Ten-yard penalty, first down Minnesota. And here is the Atlanta defense. Leonard Floyd, Eastman, Georgia. David Oyamater, Lagos, Nigeria. Brandon Dorlis, Oregon. Arnold Wipkite, Vell Free, down south. Caden Ellis, Idaho. Devon Diablo, Virginia Tech. A.J. Terrell, Clemson. Billy Bowman, Jr., Oklahoma. Jesse Bates, third. Wakeboard, Xavier Watts. Notre Dame. My views, UCF. A 31, the second to last guy to introduce himself. Keep an eye on him. They're very excited about Watts, the third rounder out of Notre Dame. Makes up the safety tandem with Bates. Bouncing the run is Aaron Jones. Not stopped after first contact. Pressed himself forward for a gain of a half dozen to the 21-yard line. It's interesting that Aaron Jones is coming out here early in the game. a week ago was Jordan Mason who really exploded on the scene after coming over from San Francisco. Gave him a big power back in the backfield. Aaron Jones caught the touchdown pass. There's Jordan Mason right there, but he caught the touchdown pass, so a little bit of a dual threat now, but once again they start with Aaron who had a fantastic year last year. Second and three, back two in. He'll bounce this to the left. And Ed McKinney grabs a leg. And it's a gain of just a yard. Arnold Ed McKinney out of Penn State. Second round pick in 2022 for Atlanta. There's Jordan Mason coming in the ball game there. You're going to see these five-man lines coming up here. They've been dropping the linebacker, Caden Ellis, down on the end of the line of scrimmage. And I think they're trying to make sure they don't get that running game jump-started here. But now the power back in there. Mason 5'11", 230. Dorothy out of the gun, going to throw against pressure here on 32, and he's going to be brought down as the Falcons get to him, bringing the extra man. And it'll be a three and out. James Pierce, Jr., one of the two first-round picks that they got to rush the passer, gets there for his first full set. Take a look at Pierce here. Boy, this would really make a difference for this football team. They have been looking for somebody to step up. Jeff Ulbrich said, all our guys are pretty good. We just need that bell cow. We need somebody who's going to be our lead rusher. Boy, would they love it to be James Pierce. Ryan Wright, fourth year out of Tulane, who's the puncher for the Vikings. Sales wants a beauty. D'Alfred's going to fair catch a 60-yard punt all the way back at the 28-yard line. So a good one from right to flip the field. Rough start for the Vikings on offense. We get practice, and Michael Penich, you can see him there. When he came off the field after their first drive, he threw his hands in the air and immediately said, I just couldn't hear anything to his coaches. Over on the Vikings sidelines, the players and coaches pointing to the crowd saying, that's all them. That's typical of this place. It's like a library or a church when the Vikings have the ball. Super quiet. It does a 180 when the Vikes are on D. Panics with time. Protected well. It throws it complete. Flag is down back here at the secondary. Well away from the ball. And they catch him a couple of yards. The quarterback is in the pocket, so perhaps illegal contact. Before the pass, illegal contact defense, number seven. Five-yard penalty, automatic first down. And it's Byron Murphy who made his first Pro Bowl with a bunch of picks last year. And Mike so far in this game it looks a lot like it did last week for the Falcons on offense they've run 12 plays now and Eight of them to be John and that one to Tyler out here the other running back So they're just trying to keep it under control They don't want this tremendous pass rush of the Vikings to get going and all the exotics that they know Brian Flores control Jonathan Grenardi just saw there one of those edge guys. That is running mate Andrew Van Hinkle tonight. Inside here. Now we see a powerful runner. Hammers it inside to the 38-yard line. A good five-yard pickup on first down for Atlanta. And it really is a different-looking Vikings defense right now. You mentioned a couple of these guys. Javon Hargrave had the big game last week, a couple of sacks. The only sacks Jonathan Allen came over from Washington. Probably the pressure tonight on number 15, Dallas Turner, taking over for Andrew Van Ginkle, who has so many roles on this defense. He plays off the ball. He drops in coverage. He had 11.5 sacks last year. A lot of different roles for him. He had a couple of pick sixes. He's everywhere. The long hair, the whole deal. Second and five. Algier pushes forward for a first down. Fourth year out of BYU. And, Chris, that combo of B. John Robinson and Tyler Algier, when that O-line is going, makes Atlanta very tough to stop. Yeah, and just like Aaron Jones and Jordan Mason on the other side, right? They have the flashy back, and then they have the hammer that comes in right after it and can really just change the pace and create some issues. He's got a feel here with this great atmosphere, home opener off the emotional win Monday night. physical run game can mute the crowd a bit. And Atlanta's done that in its opening quarter. Eight to Algier. Panic hit as he throws. Good arm. Good catch. Kyle Pitts to the 44-yard line. And another Falcon first down. Might sing the Gator fight song here. This is the Kyle Pitts that we used to watch at the University of Florida. He has really just come on here lately. And I don't know if it was confidence. I don't know if it's just the combination with Penix, but he has looked like a different player so far this year. And, man, is that making a difference for this team. I'm waiting. I'm not going to. Uh-oh, he said you were going to. There you go. That's another thing. He's stupid. A flag has been thrown not on you, but on the Falcons. Ball start. Offense. Number eight, five-yard penalty. He heard you and just cut through him off. Yeah, some Florida traditions continue. But, Chris, he was the fourth overall pick. There's never been a tight end pick that high in the draft. And then he had a great rookie season. Oh, my gosh. He's going to be everything. It just hasn't been. And now in the last year of the deal here, this is the time to get it out of him for Atlanta. But just think what it's like to cover somebody 6'6 and 250 coming down the field if you're a cornerback. And he makes it first and 15 with Robinson and is the back. And the fake by Penich and the throw is caught spinning is London. What's the football? Vikings have it. Oh, the bounce scooped up by Theo Jackson. Eric Wilson knocked it out. Jackson scooped it up. And the game's first turnover belongs to the home team. Blake Cashman out, Eric Wilson in. It's like last night's fight. Beautiful punch. It lands. 10-8, score the round for the Vikings. Drake London just made a tremendous catch and run, but it was Eric Wilson who has taken over for Blake Cashman, the quarterback, if you will, of this defense, that came down and right on the button with that punch. And he came in the game a week ago and did the exact same thing. I mean, when the quarterback of your defense goes out and not a person blinked, they said, believe me, Eric Wilson can get it done. He's been big time since. That's three years in Green Bay. Forces the turnover. McCarthy, a little play pass. Get Justin Jefferson in the game. It's JJ to JJ. Game of luck. When all else fails, go to Justin Jefferson, and that's number 500, right? It is the 500th catch in Justin Jefferson's outstanding career. Now in year six. You see the numbers he put up in year five. 180! It's hot! I can't, can't! Here we go, here we go! Turbo, touch! One, stretching it to get it to Mason, and he will be stopped. And David Onyemata struggled a bit last week, comes up with the loss of a yard on that run. It's third and two. I don't know if the timing of the tight end going across made McCarthy take a different path there, but he sort of had to go around and barely got this handoff, and by the time he did, there was just nothing left there. So once again, these short yardage situations, Vikings got to be better. And another slow starting first quarter for Minnesota This is their 10th play they only have 16 yards He will give it Mason inside he got a Minnesota first down for the first time tonight as quarter number one comes to an end Quarter controlled by Atlanta, but they only have two field goals to show for them. 6-0 Falcons, after one on Sunday Night Football, we'll be right back after these messages. Ready, set, forward. Got to get a hat on a hat in the run game, and then the plays will come from there. JJ's running the show. We've got to stack some plays and go score a touchdown right here. You just got the turnover on defense. What more do you want to see from those guys? Yeah, I think they're going to be a team that forces turnovers. Great punch out. We've got to solidify some things there as well. They're moving it pretty well. It's early in the game. Everybody's just got to settle down, capitalize on this great atmosphere, and just go play one play at a time. Thanks, Kevin. 40-year-old Kevin O'Connell, one of the coach of the year. Last year, we did the playoffs two of his first three seasons, leading the Vikings. Minnesota's first first down. McCarthy, a little play pass. Right again, now gets something inside, but only a couple yards. Jordan Mason on that one. Billy Bowman, another one of the rookies that Atlanta's asking to change this defense, made the play. You know, we talk so much about James Pierce and Jalen Walker, the two first-round draft picks on the edge. But it has been Xavier Watts, the All-American safety out of Notre Dame, and Billy Bowman, the slot defender out there that have made more big plays than anybody. Watts really had a chance for three interceptions in the game last week. They are very high on him, both of them. Second and eight. On the boot, McCarthy. He's taken off. He only had about a yard or so as he runs to the sideline. As Atlanta did a good job downfield. Chris, it was the struggle in the start of the game at Soldier Field where the Vikings had just 19 first quarter yards. 23 here tonight. This is the second game. But what happened Monday night? They didn't panic. And that includes the rookie quarterback. It does. But he's going to get different looks every single time. He has gotten a lot tonight. And if they're gonna be that exotic with their looks up front and their five-man Fronts that they've been using you got to make them pay for that with Justin Jones at some point He's one-on-one and you got to take advantage Falcons territory at the 42 yard line for Jalen Naylor Speedy Get a blitz by Divine Diablo right up the middle. And so you did, in fact, get the one-on-one. Not on Justin Jefferson, but on your other receiver, Jalen Naylor. Remember, Jordan Addison has been suspended for three games. Typically, he would be the guy that could take pressure off of Justin Jefferson. But in this case, it's Naylor. He did it last week. He did it again there. What did he do? He went to hot hot. Turbals hot. Boom. 41. Mason to the left. It's the 35 pick up six. Let's take a look at some of the different looks that they've been seeing already here. You've got Kay Nellis out here on the end of the line of scrimmage. They've dropped him down in a five-man look to try and make it a little tougher to run the football. And then they show you a six-man look and they'll drop out Diablo here right underneath the routes that they were trying to throw. And that led to the sack there. Ready? It's hot! Turbo's hot! Movement up front. Ball start. Offense, number 76. Five yard penalty. Remains second down. There's nothing like hearing a 300 pound defensive line giggle. Let's go back and hear it again. Turbo's hot! I'm telling you, it's the greatest room. We used to go hang out in the back of the defensive line. They're the funniest human beings on earth. I'm telling you, it's like that all the time. Brandon Dorlis, 295 pounds of a chuckle. Makes it second enough. Inside game, Mason. Good. Continue. Sledgehammer work to get close to the first down. He needed to get to the 31, maybe just a tough shot. And those are some of the plays that were really working for them a week ago. They started pulling these offensive linemen, but it was his finishes that really made the difference. The difference between getting hit and that being a four-yard game, instead now you're down in third and one, just makes all the difference in the world. That power element to this offense is something we just haven't seen for a little while Give a couple of those yards to the rookie Donovan Jackson. I just grabbed him and pulled him With basic for the first down the Christian McCaffrey was injured Mason took more of a role and was effective and with all that big-ticket numbers that they had to pay salary cap wise in San Francisco, they couldn't keep him, and now he's here with the Vikings. Yeah, this is an interesting offense. And they really, you know, they've got the big player, obviously, with Jefferson. And you just get the feeling at some point here, they're winding him up. You know, at some point, they're going to see somebody they like on Jefferson. But they've been staying in that too-deep safety look, trying to avoid that possibility. Both backs in now, Mason and Jones. with Carvey pressure, and he's going to go down. Down, but it'll be a sack as they closed in on him with the veteran Leonard Floyd. Wherever he goes, he gets eight or more sacks in the last few years. He's got one here. But it's that five-man front once again that's really been bugging this offensive line, and what that does is it creates one-on-one for their best pass rusher, But you can see across the board that five-man front is creating one-on-ones for the better pass rushers of the Falcons. One sack last week. Two already in the first half for Atlanta. Second and long. McCarthy. Middle for TJ. Hawkinson is incomplete. There is Divine Diablo. If you watch the Falcons and he stays healthy, you're going to see number zero a lot this year. That's exactly what Jeff Ulbricht was talking about. That former safety body that has grown into a linebacker body that still has the moves and the athleticism of a safety. And I'll go back. That's Fred Warner. That's exactly the style that they played in San Francisco. And they are so excited that they have one of the boys here with Atlanta. Diablo is with the Raiders to start his career. Third and 18 on the edge of field goal range. Can't give up a sack. McCarthy World of cats for Adam feeling Minnesota's own He's down A little once it hit the ground ground with the bad Vikings are on the ball subs happen so they held it for a second Falcons not challenging for the moment first down inside the 20 line it is caught the one by nailer so back-to-back throws by McCarthy to Thielen and then Naylor. And it's first and goal for the Vikings. It's been Naylor so far running these one-on-one routes against A.J. Terrell. The best for the Falcons. And we were doing some quick counting there. I think they had 10 out there. They did indeed. That makes it easier. Sure it does. McCarthy. Getting into a rhythm on this drive. Mason the back first and goal. Officially from the two. Fink it. He lost the ball on the fake. He was not touched when he was down. So he keeps it alive. And it's incomplete as Jefferson streaks across the back of the end zone. I don't even know what that was. I couldn't tell if he was trying to pitch the thing out to Mason or not at the end of this thing. It was going to fake that flip and he was going to turn around throw a pass He was like me with that pin in Baltimore I accidentally slipped it in the guy's hair right in the front row didn't mean to do it, but I don't think he did either Those who were with us that night to remember that we've been talking about that pretty much every week last three years Second and goal whistle here there's a way a game and Kevin a little unhappy often Vikings have some trouble with timing of getting out of the huddle in the middle part of the game in Chicago on Monday night and we're unhappy there as the substitutions were going on and McCarthy was being held from taking the snap and that's why it was delay again and those play calls aren't easy they're all around 15 words and you've had plenty of conversations with McCarthy about calling those plays From the 7-yard line, J.J. Pierser on from behind. Advocating, no, it's not advocating. Thank you, Pards. Jalen Walker around the edge. The rookie out of Georgia with the sack. So both first-round picks, Pierce and Walker, have sacks in this first half. And the problem remains the same here. Until Christian Derisaw comes back, Justin School is going to have to get help. And they understood that they had to help him more in this game than they did last time. They rolled the dice on that one and paid the price. That is the Bunkus Award winner. Terrific career in Athens. That left tackle who's missing, Christian Derrissaw. There on the sideline watching. Third and goal. McCarthy escaping and will be trapped down. So this draft instant impact as James Pearson is one of the two there. For the Falcons, along with Ruk Orororo forcing the field goal. And that's really what they're trying to do here Mike. They are playing about nine guys on that defensive line keeping everybody fresh They didn't get those sacks a week ago and they are coming in throws here so far and one of the hard parts about playing with the young quarterback is Takes a little while to learn all that those guys you have two and a half seconds period. That's it throw it Through three for three on the season Off a good rookie year here in the bike Minnesota on the board six three halfway through the center Love love love the state. Yeah, it's great. You get a chance to be close to the field even in the broadcast booth There's something away Great design the glass exterior Daylight coming in 6-3 after the Rikers field goal and now he will kick off By D offered he's got it back. He's got a ways to go and he's right that the 23 by Ivan Pace, Jr Kirk Cousins a whole lot of money to be their quarterback of now and they drafted the quarterback of the future who is the quarterback now takes over at the 23 Dijon Robinson up to the 30-yard line, game of about 7 you know it was interesting talking and there's Kirk Cousins over there who's handled everything just beautifully the transition has to be hard and he's feeling better now right Mike yes and he's felt so whenever he gets an opportunity expected different looking Kirk Cousins. But talking about Penix with Raheem, he was basically saying, we went out to Washington State to work him out on a freezing day. Almost anybody else would have opted out. Not only did he do it, he was brilliant, threw the heck out of the ball, and we knew we had something special. Second and three. It's run by Robinson for a couple of yards. It'll be third and one. Here's Melissa. Hey, Mike, I asked Les Tackle, Jake Matthews, about Michael Penix this week and the word he kept using to describe him was poised. Jake said Michael's confidence in the huddle and commanding the offense speaks to his ability as a football player but also about his character. Jake simply described him as a stud and said he can't wait to give him more opportunities to make plays. Almost everyone who's been around him has just walked away super impressed and that veteran Matthews in year 12 in the league. Seen a bunch of quarterbacks. Likes what they see so far. Third and inches Algier. The inside for the first down. Tyler's got it at the 35-yard line. Chris, we saw one of the starts. So we had three starts at the end of last year. Panics took over. They lost the game at Washington. Then they lost the last game of the season. Those two overtime games. And then last week when they lose to Tampa, a missed field goal keeps them from overtime. He's played well in his first four NFL starts. Well, he had the go-ahead touchdown last week. He had the go-ahead touchdown in Washington when we were watching him out there. and then they go down and score the other way. So he's done his job. It just hasn't worked out to win the games yet. But they all look at him as the guy now, no doubt. Play action, pressure from Pace is picked up by Robinson. But nobody opened downfield. And Pennix taken down by Dallas Turner. That's the man they're hoping to get going. More time for the injured Andrew Van Ginkle. And a sack and a loss of nearly 10. Oh, this is going to make some people happy in Minnesota right here. It took a little while to get there, but as Penix was playing dodgeball with other people, ran right into Turner, and that's big time. If they can get that third-edge player out there when Van Ginkle comes back, it could be exciting. He was a first-round pick. They have high, high expectations. He can cover, too. He's a good dropper. second and 20 and throw underneath the ring McLeod nothing doing as Eric Wilson forced the fumble on the last drive there to make it third in line Play clock. Just in time. Renard got hit by two guys coming off the edge. One of them, B. John Robinson, has got some room to run. It will be five yards shy of the first down as he's knocked out just past the 41-yard line. The Falcons get some yards back, but they'll punt the ball away. Big time, Stan. We're seeing both of these defenses, and I think they're feeding off of each other a little bit. You have the exotics on one side. We knew about the Minnesota Vikings and what they would be able to do, but Atlanta has come back on the other side and sort of matched exotic for exotic, so it's really turned into a really interesting defensive game against these young quarterbacks. Bradley Pinion kicks to the rookie out of Indiana Price 26 yards, Price, good tackle Well covered This special team shooting has done a good job It's the second time And it has been pressure, pressure, pressure 9 of 14 times now 64% the highest for Atlanta since 2018 2018 This is a team that has forever chased sacks. Or people who can put pressure on the quarterback. They've been the worst in the NFL over the last five or six years. And they look a little different out here tonight. And they've got a new center in for Minnesota. Michael Juergens. No offensive snaps last year. Second year in the league. Didn't play in week one. Helping to block there for Aaron Jones. Who gets out to the 20. Why is Juergens in, Melissa? Yes, that is because Vikings center Ryan Kelly is being evaluated. right now for a concussion. He went into the medical tent with the independent concussion specialist who then came out, looked at the monitor, and sent him to the locker room where he remains now. Meanwhile, J.J. McCarthy did take a couple of practice snaps on the sideline with Michael Juergens. So Kelly, veteran, four-time pro bowler, started 123 games, couch, inexperienced Juergens there. That pressure came right through Juergens. For the pass completed to Thielen for the first down at the 25-yard line. It's a really big deal, Mike. It is. When you have a second-year guy playing quarterback like McCarthy, so many of the calls run through the veteran center. They were so excited. They thought Ryan Kelly was going to be a big player and a big contributor. He's been much more than that because he's been around the league, and you've got a young quarterback, and he can just rely on Ryan Kelly. Now I think McCarthy is taking a little different approach himself and trying to just get the ball out of his hands. Don't take those hits. Flash it here. Protected for the moment. And that throw is intercepted if inbounds by Billy Bowman Jr. He landed on the body, comes down inbounds, and Bowman comes up with the interception. He was a ball hawk in his college days at Oklahoma, had 11 career picks. Rolling on the field is an interception. First down, Atlanta. I think that's right in any way you want to look at it. That looks right to me. And the one thing that when you talked to Jeff Ulbrich, he was so excited about Billy Bowman. He said, you know what, I might put him on Jefferson because he is so sticky. When he gets connected to a receiver, he is just on him. He's not the fastest. He's not the quickest. He's not any of that. But when he gets connected to a receiver, they don't get off of him, and you saw it exactly. right there. Kevin O'Connell and J.J. McCarthy going back over. Every interception is its own story. Trying to get to what happened there, what he saw. Now a great opportunity for Michael Penix Jr. and the Falcons. They'll play the Vikings in this first half. Only lead by three as this Robinson runs in the 35. Will take us to the two-minute warning. Comes at 1.59. Falcons up three with the ball in great field position after the pick It's 19 of the first 29 decided by eight or less every mistake amplified JJ McCarthy is just throwing a pick and now Michael Penn exterior in the Falcons two timeouts Timeouts. Have it at the 35, second and seven. And Grenard got a great jump, maybe too good a jump as a flag is thrown, and then a second one after that. Two flags, two separate fouls to figure out. First one certainly offside on Grenard, who's feeling the worst of that. And they're coming to look at the veteran defensive lineman. That's a big deal because they already are without Andrew Van Genkel. There are two fouls on the play. Offside defense, number 58, holding offense, number 71. Those penalties offset. Replay, second down. Athletic training staff out to look at Grenard. The hold was a result of the offsides. He was out of position, so he felt like to keep his quarterback safe, he had to do something. So flag thrown there they offset they look at Grenard will step out for a moment So the offsetting penalties get us back to second and seven Here were the buck 56 left in this first half Robinson First down Pace brings him down 28 Renard back in for the Vikings Vikings kind of kind of break on that last one really wasn't much of a hold at all on Elijah Wilkinson got a foot short the first down Tyler Algeer the back Caleb McGarry the right tackle who's been there the last six years was in they run it right behind him without gear to the right Stance out here to the left and it works first down to the 19 yard line for Algier That time Ivan pace took a chance tried to shoot the gap in there and make a play in the hole and they go opposite and created that space in there so there was an opportunity but just good running on the other side trying to come up with another red zone stop in terms of touchdowns they've done it a couple of times in his first half he finds out here on the sideline 15-yard line still a couple of timeouts in 36 seconds Minnesota bookkeeping did lose a timeout on that injury earlier I really like watching Michael Penix get the ball out of his hands very very quick release big strong arm he has one heck of a future in front of him and now trying to pay this one off neither one of these offenses have been very good down here in the red zone and you're also going to get some likely exotics now out of the Vikings with London down at the bottom of your screen the favorite target for Penix Going left side to the end zone. Nothing cooking there. Good coverage. Isaiah Rogers came over to this team. The champion Eagles. Third down coming up. When we talk about exotics, this is what we're talking about. They're going to cross the linebackers and rush everybody else. Now you've got to hold up and man coverage. When you do that on the back end of it, a lot of pressure now on these corners. And remember Jeff Bakuto, who was their third corner out of this one, Harrison Smith. Also out at safety I'll pits out left to the lefty pennix 36 Trying to get it to Ray Ray McLeod and the coverage came from Dwight McLaughlin Symphony man out of Arkansas Did not play any defense a week ago, but he was there when needed, and another field goal attempt coming. Yeah, McLaughlin was that guy that they felt like this was his week. Hey, dude, you've been around here for a year now. You got it. Show me something. And he did right there. That was the biggest play of the half. Parker Romo, the kicker who's taking over at least this week for young Waipu. It'll still be a battle going forward for the next few weeks. He's an Atlanta-area kid born in Peachtree City. He's called that area home for 17 years of his life. And his 33-yard field goal by Romo is good. He's made all three of his attempts in his Falcon debut. 9-3 Atlanta. We're back in 30 seconds. After this, here, Chris, 25 seconds for the Vikings, who will get the ball and start the second half because Atlanta won the toss and took the ball to start the game. Yeah. Hey, they gave Tom Brady a chance in the Super Bowl. He was young. Let's go see what he's got I mean it really is it's like you want to put these guys in as many pressure situations Let's go find out I see what he does this kickoff return from the five Trying to work it to the wide side It doesn't work out. So now, not only 18 seconds, we're back at the 20-yard line. You refer back to Brady in that first Super Bowl when he just decided that we're going to go for it, and they end up getting the win, won that Super Bowl on a game-winning Vinatieri field goal. But also what you do is, if you're going to do that, you're going to check down a couple and do it. But that kick took a lot of time off the clock, so I don't know, and you didn't get it out past the 20-yard line. So now, probably be a little more conservative. We're finding with these kick returns how a good kick return 35 40 art changes everything you can do especially at the end of a half No question So McCarthy takes over at the 20 you see his numbers For the Falcons in this first half and that is Brandon or this the guy who was Giggling earlier comes up with the sack But the Falcons have an injury in the secondary This has not been a good half For the Minnesota Vikings And you can tell It is just McCarthy's trying to get it figured out They've thrown a lot of different looks at him They've thrown a lot of different stunts And blitzes And they're going to have to really simplify To start the second half anytime the Falcons have to remember their secondary down I think I know who it is just don't want to do an identification by being sure of it AJ Terrell, yes it is, okay I saw the four, couldn't see the two, couldn't see AJ sitting up with the athletic training staff and a hand up from his coach Raheem Morris as well Yeah, he's the best they've got back there. Back to grab. Back behind his leg there. And walks off. So J.J. McCarthy's 7 of 10, but only two targets to Justin Jefferson. One catch for nine yards. And, Chris, it was one of the things that when asked during the week, Kevin O'Connell, about what was going on on the sideline during those first three quarters in Chicago when things were going bad, Justin Jefferson stayed with it. Sometimes a receiver who's a superstar like he is can get hot, can get frustrated. He stayed the course with them, and it paid off in the fourth quarter. Well, and what you just saw is significant. A.J. Terrell is their top one-on-one cover guy. So even if they going to double Jefferson with somebody else Terrell would have to cover one one of the other receivers Now you take him out of the mix and now you might have to do more zone and not bring the kind of pressure they brought here in the first half that paid off Although, here we go again with Caden Ellis down on the end of the line of scrimmage. Falcons charge timeout with that injury in the final two minutes, 12 seconds remaining. Land up bringing five. McCarthy trying to load up and throw down the middle. There's Jefferson. J.J. to the 33-yard line with time. They get the timeout with two seconds left. Almost a mirror image of what they did last Monday night in Chicago to get a field goal before halftime. Top of route moves is what makes this guy so special. Watch the little wiggle at the top here and right past the safety. He got up on this safety so fast he's going to try and jump it. And you can see just wrong foots him and gets all the green grass. There is the get. Woo, what a big play to end this half. It was McCarthy to nail her for 28 yards and set up Reichard for a 59-yard field goal at the end of the half. That's Soldier Field on Monday. And now that pass to Jefferson sets up Reichard from 51 yards. And the Vikings have hit the repeat button on the end of the half again this week. Wow. Like you say, Chris, put it in a situation. Give them a shot. The half feels completely different to me now, right? They're going in here, and everything, you're going to go, oh, my gosh, that was a disaster. We're terrible. Hit one play, hit kick, the field goal. Now you feel good going in at the half. Melissa. Raheem, you give up a big play to end the half. What's your message to the defense? Oh, we just got to go out there and we got to score in red zone on offense. Our defense just got to hold up. Obviously, we can't get that big play. A little emotional letdown right there with a guy going out. But the next man got to step and be ready to deal. Yeah, and you've got three field goals. You mentioned that on offense. How do you turn those into touchdowns? We just got to execute and go out there and do what we need to do. We can't let the crowd get in the way and be a part of this game. Our edge, our energy, our execution. Raheem, thanks. Thank you, guys. Thank you, Melissa. That is what happened in the red zone. That's the story of the half. Vikings get the ball. The return to start this second half by Miles Price. Get to the outside, brought down at the 23D, all for the special teams of stock. To the first half for J.J. Chris. Hi, J.J. Let's see what you have here. Of course, we had the fumble on the short yardage, played fourth and inches, and just could not convert that because of it. Then the old flick, I've been there before, and that didn't work out so great. Got sacked a lot, too, and five times in that first half. So questions along that offensive line, especially now without Ryan Kelly and Justin School still in the left tackle position. So there's only one choice for J.J. McCarthy now. You run it or you get the ball out of your hand very quickly. But also they're going to a four-man rush look here now because of the injury. 22, a little flip to the edge. Jones turning the corner. There's Jones the 30-yard line. Again, to make two big injury updates. Brian Kelly, we mentioned the center for the Vikings, out for the remainder of the game as he was getting checked for a concussion. And same true for A.J. Terrell, the corner for the Falcons. He's out for the remainder of the game. Then a hamstring injury. So two starters out, corner and center. It's huge. And what it's probably going to do is force them into zones, which means fewer opportunities to blitz. Now, let's see. They didn't blitz the first one. Let's see what they do here. Nope. Two. Protected. Now fires downfield for Thielen. Incomplete. Dee Alford back there in coverage. We had so much fun talking to Justin Jefferson and Adam Thielen. Thielen, the trade, coming back here from Carolina after a couple years. Chris, the oldest receiver in the league by a year and a half at age 35, comes back to the place where he's from, Minnesota. Yeah, third most catches in Minnesota history. A couple of guys everybody knows, Chris Carter, Randy Moss, the only ones ahead of him to give you some idea of what he's done in purple. New story from Division II, Minnesota State. Grew up in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota. 50 miles from here. Third and two. McCarthy. Places it in there. It's taken away again by Bowman. Bowman having a knife. Two picks, and on his way. First and goal, as he's at the 10-yard line. And taken out by the tackle just in school. Now, is it an interception or not? Let's go look at that first. It felt live like it bounced. And it did. After replay assisted, it is an incomplete pass. Fourth down. There's a replay assist on it. Good news is it's an incompletion. Bad news for the Vikings. It is three and out. They'll have to punt it away. Kevin O'Connell's never been so happy to punt in his whole life, though. I mean, it is becoming a problem. And, Mike, even when they're not blitzing, they are faking blitzes all the time. And I think in a young quarterback's mind, that becomes an issue, too. The other part of this is neither one of these quarterbacks have done well in the red zone. The red zone in the NFL is a completely different scheme, completely different offense and defense, and it just takes time to get there. Just to remind everyone that this is start number five in Pennick's career, start number two for McCarthy. I get the feeling some kick return or interception return, something is going to end up winning this game. All right, all right. Kicking away. Meantime on this forcing the fair catch by Natron Books. Brooks, the kick is 50, no return. So McCarthy sitting next to Carson Wentz, his backup will go over what he saw. And it'll be Michael Pettix Jr.'s turn now for the Falcons. Well, they started off hot with Bijan Robinson. One, two, right off the bat, a couple of big runs. And then the Vikings started to respond with pressure of their own, I think, almost to stop the run as much as anything else. These big guys up front really making a difference. Jonathan Allen, Javon Burkitt, Jalen Redwood. Completely different D-line right now for the Vikings. From 21, here is Bijan running inside, staying up, not down with a body part as he spun on a body and makes it a nine-yard gain to the 30-yard line. Good balance by Nijon Robinson. And any time you see these guys blitzing from the back side, and that time it was pace, and he just thought the play was over. You can see he was standing up getting ready to go back to the huddle. Robinson had a very good first quarter, and most yards he's had in the first quarter. Out of the gate, and he's rushed for 81 yards thus far tonight. And trying to add to it here with a first down to 32-yard line. So B. John Robinson, right? And his name is one we talk about a lot, Chris, right? Because he's done all these things. 100-yard scrimmage games, add another one to it. You wouldn't think that he has more than Saquon Barkley and King Henry, but he does now with 20. But when you hear Saquon Barkley talking about B. John Robinson, you understand that he understands who Bijan is. He's in, and a flag. Killing this play with a false start. False start offense. There were 71. Five-yard penalty. May 1st out. There's not praise and then there's that yeah From him with what he did last year That only makes it first and 15 Incomplete here's a Robinson's been doing on this night Yeah, be John Robinson. We saw him come right off the bat and create some big big plays Down the field and we have been talking about it for a while But these defensive players talk about it one guy very very rarely gets him on the ground then that explosive speed he weighs about 220 pounds just that complete package and one of the better receiving backs in the league getting loud second and 15. Lee's Robinson with that cut and a deep and a move 27-yard line. Thank you Fardis. He gets a lot of that penalty yardage plus back. These two guys had no idea where the ball was watch America run right by B. John They're blitzing their Overpowering the center they're doing it all of a sudden B. John's running the other way Pennix throws with his own defense sitting in that zone for the first down. Darnell Mooney. I don't know if Pennix has a quarterback guru that he works with all the time, but that is one of the quickest releases that you will see. I mean, he has the ability to, as soon as he sees it, that thing is gone. And that ability gives you as a receiver that extra tick of a second to be open and to accept the football. It is, I think Pennix is extremely talented. First down down tonight. Robinson Gress out here with the carry. And he stopped Jalen Redman, who Chris mentioned earlier. Second-year guy out of Oklahoma. He was undrafted and as these big-name veterans like Javon Hargrave and Jonathan Allen have come around the Vikings They think hey wait a minute 61 red, but it's really good Yeah, we were talking with Jonathan Allen and he's the one that brought up his name and he's actually out there playing that three technique But you could see the explosive nature of it And when you have guys like Javon Hargrave and Jonathan Allen and their resume Talking about Jalen Redman, you know they found one and that play was Chris Linship The best guards in the league yep, and heck of the play by Redmond Down Missed week one with a shoulder injury Bear who had a very good season with the second leading pass catcher in all the key categories last year for it. Yeah, Mooney is an explosive guy. 21 catches over 20 yards. That tied for second in the National Football League, so desperately needed to try and open up some of those other guys. Algier, the running back, third to couple. He's got it, and he's got it. First down for the Falcons. His drive rolls on at the 40. Charlie Werner is right here and he is the old Moose Johnston kind of guy Algiers just gonna follow him wherever he goes that's where I'm going Because you know he's gonna take out somebody he is the lead blocker he is the fullback He is the intimidating factor coming out of the backfield when he's that lead blocker Robinson through space And into the secondary To the 22 yard line That's 18 that time It puts Pijon over 100 yards rushing tonight So here once again You're going to see Charlie Werner come right through These guys are getting upfield so fast That if they don't clog it up on the initial contact With the blitz there by pace There are gaps It's like, you know, in short yardage, Mike, sometimes they break off one for about 70 yards. Same thing. The Vikings are being so aggressive, and the Falcons now are taking advantage of it. Keep feeding Robinson. One tackle spins for a couple. So you keep hearing St. B. John Robinson, right? So that was his name the first couple of years, and then there was a story in an interview that it's B. John, And that's the way his mom and his grandma like it pronounced then we get on our call with him this week said hey man Just tell us about the whole Bajon man. I said well actually I really don't like being called Bajon I want to be Bajon so we said you sure they're like 20 million people watching like yeah It's back to Bajon so it is and we said well you explain it to mom and grandma exactly Hemmings thrust left and the lefty fires to the sideline and finds Bajon Bajon But when it has been third and short, it's Algier. Title. Following Warner to the right. That time the Vikings get in the way. So what will Raheem Morris do? It's a couple yards here. Fourth down is going to send on Parker Romo for another field goal attempt. And again, in the red zone, the Vikings defense steps up. It has been exactly that, Mike. It has just been the inability of the Falcons to score touchdowns instead of these field goals. And they really have not gotten that close. We haven't seen one really well-orchestrated play in the red zone, really, from either one of these things. Parker Romo lost the kicking battle in New England in the preseason to a drafted kicker. So that happens often. Three agents signed this week. He's now four for four on the night. And he's added yet another 33-yard field goal. He's going to be well-wish for the Vikings, who played there for a couple of seasons between stadiums. So instead of the touchback to the 35, it is brought out by Price. And he is brought down around the 30. So J.J. McCarthy will take over. And this is the last day of a week he will never. What are we on? It's hard to imagine all of it in one week for a 22-year-old as McCarthy steps into this job here with the Vikings and gives first down to Jordan Mason to the right side. You know, that really was what jump-started the Vikings a week ago against Chicago. It was Jordan Mason. They just stuck to the run, and he popped a couple little counter runs with pulling offensive linemen in front of him. But the deeper you go down the depth chart with the offensive line, the harder that gets, too. So you're already playing with a backup left tackle. Now you have a backup center in the game. It's not easy to make all those adjustments, so the Falcons keep firing. He shakes the shoulders, looks for an opening, and finds Mason. One shot of the first down. Right at the 40-yard line. He'll set up third and one. but Mike, that play that Justin Jefferson made before the half scared the heck out of this defense because now they don't have their A-lister at cornerback, and so they're settling for a lot of zones, so a lot of the blitzes that they executed in the first half, they're showing but dropping out so that they can fill up the gaps in the zone defense. They do not want Jefferson one-on-one on anybody. Zero, zero, zero. With third and one. Waiting for Mason in the Falcon front. Starting with Caden Ellis. Let's see what O'Connell will do with fourth and a full yard here as he gets marked on the 40-yard line. We have seen time after time Divine Diablo make these kinds of plays. And we talked about athleticism, how it impacts blitzing, how it impacts coverage. But, man, it can matter in short yardage, too. They're going, and the play clock's running down here. Ten seconds as they break the huddle. You see the probability. I can't, can't. 180. I got it. Copy keeping. Didn't make it earlier in this situation. Let's see where they mark him here. and Gunyamata was on him, but passed the 41-yard line. And the new Pompers got a first down for his offense. That was a good job by Michael Juergens to get underneath that nose tackle with that block and got just a little bit of a movement there. Just enough to unsettle. Cal London again No snaps on offense last year second-year player Really see the most action of his brief NFL career Flags gonna bring it back The Rouse, second-year player, came in for Justin School. Yeah, and it really was unnecessary. Watch this play unfold. The runner is really going past, and he's going to grab just a little bit, but there is no way he was going to catch up to Jordan Mason. School, you saw getting up slow a couple of plays ago, now goes into the medical tent. So the Vikings are using two backup linemen here. Behind their quarterback making their in front of the quarterback making a second start From the 31 Set up third down Second down This is a far cry from 41-40 you took that out he and Aaron Jones with contact not the ball loose for a second I think you're scared to the pocket looking to take off here downfield block and runs it 48 yard line this up 35 that was the running back Jones out there in front of them to help clear a path. Right here, Aaron Jones in the backfield is going to help be a lead blocker on this one. Out in front, come on, let's go. And just knockout punch there down the field. Got Dee Alford pretty good. So officially 16 on the run, it's 34. That's movement on the right tackle Brian O'Neal. False start offense. Number 75. Five-yard penalty. Main start down. Yeah, it doesn't necessarily mean it was O'Neal. because a lot of other people were moving too. Sometimes the center missed snap counts too. I mean, the execution too have gotten that down with a chance to convert and make that mistake. Now you open up the playbook. Now if they want to bring pressure, they certainly can. And here they come. It's like they're bringing it off the slot as well. McCarthy. It is ruled incomplete. Incomplete for Jefferson. It was short. So the ground fourth down to the Vikings. We'll punt it away with a minute 35 left here in the third. Don't blame anybody else there. J.J. flat out missed that one. And just one hops it in there. And you had somebody wide open. It looked like he got stepped on or something happened to him at the end of that play as well. Talking about J.J. McCarthy. very similar to the movie last week for the Vikings as they have struggled to find an offensive rhythm in the first three quarters. Ryan Wright kicking it away. Two yards in the run-up on the fair catch. Brooks brings it in shy of the 20. And that is where the Falcons will take over. In his field goal fest. Chris Lindstrom. That dive cut block that he's almost patented. He's so good at it. Good reach block on the outside. Stay on it. Let Bijan run. He is just time after time. Pass protection. Doesn't matter. One of the very best offensive linemen in the National Football League. He plays right guard for the Falcons. And you can almost ignore his band. very very rarely is he involved in a play take job on JJ McCarthy stepped on on that incompletion to Jefferson a moment ago Lindstrom and the offense back out there the beat John Robinson as the running back the left for a couple of yards Robinson at 117 now here on the night you know Brian Flores I asked him a question when things are going poorly For the offense to make you more inclined to take chances and he goes Chris our job is to get the ball back from the office I said your guys roll their eyes when the offense isn't doing well. He goes. No, he goes I'm on a hard if any of those guys do anything like that Second sack of the night for the Vikings. A big loss for Hennicks and the Falcons. Here's one guy to pick and the other guy to come get the sack. Great teamwork here by the Minnesota Vikings. They were desperate. They needed a play out of anybody. Offense, defense, special teams. And there you go. Big play. sets them up. And four, getting to Penix, broken up, trying to get it to Pips. Josh Metellus, the coverage, three and out Minnesota, and that Brian Flores-led defense does its job. Well, he can say he may not attack extra, But that's exactly what he's doing right there. Eric Wilson gonna come all the way around here Then you'll see Mattelis on the back end in to knock this ball down So sometimes it's the offense that wakes you up Sometimes it's the defense and right now this defense is playing great Without a first down tonight Bradley pinion kicks to miles price Take it on a bounce. 42. Trying to work the sideline. This Atlantic covers on it. It's really, really good. McCarthy and the offense to take over at our own 47th as the third quarter comes to an end. Only points a Falcon field goal. Only points all night. Field goals. 12-6 Atlanta here in Minnesota. We're going to go to the fourth. Sunday Night Football continues after these messages. KJ McCarthy and the Vikings were down 17-6 to the Bears. And KJ had a three-touchdown fourth quarter. Can he hook in the week with another big quarter? Knocks starting like that. Balls out. And recovered by Devine Diablo. The pressure came from Zach Harrison. Twisting McCarthy and forcing the fumble. Unbelievable. This pressure is going to come right off the edge, and not one person gets a finger on a defensive edge player. It's just, I don't, this is a team that's well coached. They averaged 27 points a game last year. They went 14-3. Sam Darnold was the quarterback. They make a change, and right now, they don't look like they really understand the offense. Can the two changes up front on the offensive line because of injury contribute to that? Absolutely. You've got a new left tackle, new center in there, and you mentioned earlier, Chris, when Kelly was injured, how much he handles up front identifying stuff. Atlanta's done a great job here tonight. The 38, can they turn one of these into a score? P. John Robinson was thinking that, just got pulled down before galloping into the secondary. And last week he was up and down the bench I got you I got you I got you but right now We've seen this offense be bad for six quarters and good for one quarter and We also now have got to see this Vikings defense step up again They just had a great series got the ball back short Field and now the right back with their backs against the wall. They got to do it again Yeah. Robinson, bouncing to the outside. Close to wait for one, but not Dallas Turner, but it is enough for the first down. For B. John Robinson, now 17 carries, 128 yards on the nut. That's one of those things you do in Madden, right? There's one of those buttons you push and it makes you spin. I've never actually found it, but I do know it exists. But he has all the moves. And when you're talking about when somebody's like 5'8 and weighs 180 pounds and runs like that, you go, that's impressive. I mean, this guy's 215 pounds, and you would never understand that. There he goes again. Again has to turn the other way. This time trapped behind a scrimmage, and Isaiah Rogers brings him down. The loss of a couple. Big time play that time by Jonathan Allen to get that initial penetration across the line of scrimmage. And you just have to disrupt. You cannot let him get started where he wants to go. Wants to go outside zone the other way. And Jonathan Allen with that penetration sets his team up They have to make another stand The guys they spent the money on in the offseason Allen and hard grave up front In there to make the play That is outstanding defense not only red and also leave by Drake Rodriguez in there But that was a meeting at the quarterback. You could see all of them Jonathan Bernard in there as well And now they backed them up potentially how the field goal range You'll go from here be 57 yards That's trying to get some of it back here The six-point lead that is significant Significant. Third and 21, Vikings bringing pressure. Panics in timeout. Taken at the top by Raheem Morris before the play kept going. Before the play clock expired, timeout Atlanta, their first. Chris, for Atlanta, too, it's the same thing. They have not bogged down offensively as much as Minnesota, but they've been in the red zone a good part of this night, and they've led some opportunities. They're keeping the Vikings in the game by not being able to finish. This defense has just been playing unbelievably. I mean, it really has been. But it is inexperienced at the quarterback position. Games in the National Football League are one in short yardage situations. They're one in the red zone. That's the reason the Eagles are world champions. They were great in short yardage situations, and they were great down in the red zone. They had people that could put the ball in the end zone. Right now, these two quarterbacks are trying to figure out how to do that. And again, McCarthy's second start, Panik's fifth start. Third and 21. Panik's out quick to his tight end, Kyle Pitts. Josh Metellus to tackle. Minimal gain. Going to make the field goal about 55 yards here for the new kicker, Parker Romo. But this is big here, Mike, because you miss it. You're right back, sort of at midfield-ish, for a chance to go down the field and finally score a touchdown and go win the game. So the difference between a made field goal here and a missed one is significant. Forward progress marked the ball to 36, not where it was initially being marked. Thus, it's a 54-yard field goal. Parker Romo hit a 55-yarder here for the Vikings last year. And for 54, he is proving worthy of the job. Tryout this week during practice. The decision to let Parker Romo kick. He is 5 for 5 on the night. And the Atlanta Falcons have a 9-point lead in Minnesota. Former member of team Schuster that helped curling become popular here in the U.S. And kickoff going to be brought out from one deep by Miles Price. And this Atlanta coverage team has been phenomenal tonight. Great special teams effort. Josh Woods there. Well Chris, this defense this is what the Falcons needed to fix this year. And get this straightened out. Just look at the last five years. Last in the National Football League. 30 fewer sacks than any other team. So way last. But a double-digit sack man could come. They wanted to go in the draft, try to find somebody. And they went with a couple of guys out of the SEC. And Walker and Pierce signed Leonard Floyd, who's been eight sacks a year, each of the last five. And now that defense is showing up from the 19-yard line. They start this drive on a run with Mason. it'll take it to the 25-yard line. Mike, I was talking with Jeff Ulbrich, who's the defensive coordinator, and he was the coach and head coach ultimately with the Jets, and he said, I learned a hard lesson up there. We really didn't have the four-man rush that could always apply pressure, but I stuck to it because it's what I really believe in. I really believe in sticking to that four-man rush. Let this play go. What's the hotline? Hey, water, water! Third ball cut. That's a hard count. Trying to get a free five. They don't. No run. Mason's two. It'll be third and one coming up. But it didn't work. And I was too hard-headed to change. And I get here, and we don't have that A-lister. We don't have that guy that's going to end up with 15 or 16 sacks. So I have to start doing things that are a little out of my comfort zone. Sending more people. Blitzing people, bringing people out of the secondary. And so far, that formula has just looked great out here tonight. All those players who've gotten to McCarthy, they're in the gun here on third and one. Falcons bringing pressure. Picked up. McCarthy downfield. Overshoots. Jalen Naylor had a step. Oh, my goodness. This is a dream. This is what you dream about when you play receiver and quarterback. Slot fade. You've got all the room in the world. Runs right past Billy Bowman. And as a quarterback, you have to put that ball way up in the air. How many times we talk about Russell Wilson? Throw that moon ball up there so your receiver can find it. The defensive back is desperate. He, at the very least, is going to run into your receiver. You get a long pass interference penalty. The one thing you cannot do is overthrow it under throw it all day. No problem Beautiful kick late fair catch signal made by Brooks 5.2 good hang time by right Gaines in Atlanta's hands. They've got control and they've got a nine-point lead Can get to another one during the time Michael Penix Jr Here's their quarterback. Turned the operation over to him late last year. Trying to even their record at 1-1. The road win here in Minnesota. Up 9. 9.5 to go. Gave him a couple for Robinson. Michael Penix, I like a lot. Let's take a look at some of the things he's been able to do in this game. Watch this release. So quick. So what do we do? We put a clock on it, of course. 0.3 seconds among the elite to ever play the game. Very rarely is any quarterback ever, no matter how good, under that. But he also gets the ball out of his hands. Quick read, quick delivery, quick release. There is a lot to like about Michael Phillips. Play adjustment here. The noise gets louder. Robinson left. Chocking him onto the ball. As reaching for it was Eric Wilson's gonna set up a big third down here 845 to go The one thing I really like about B. John Robinson is watch his acceleration because he'll go slow when he first gets the ball right Yeah, let me see in their room And goes right in there so fast and has a little power behind it and every first down now Is just a huge win for the Atlanta Falcons 35 yards now for Robinson third and two Penix out quick and held on to for the first down. Team Drake London not targeted as much as he was in the win, in the loss I should say, in week one. It's his third target, but that's a big catch at a first down for Atlanta. So they use London to go out into motion here to create that space right there. motion goes out there's a little hole turn around you got plenty of room to pick up that first down well designed well thrown good play some more time off this club the Vikings needing it twice Tyler out here now the running back Play clutch out here to the right. The flag down as well. And a little to the pace of the linebackers make the tackle. Holding often. Number 70. Ten-yard penalty made for South. On the veteran, Jake Matthews. Bernard is just so quick. And he gets into those gaps late like that. And now you've got to try to cut him off right there. And he's so fast. There just isn't any way to do it other than to hook your arm. And now here goes Atlanta backwards. So every time we think we're getting a little offense going, it goes in reverse. It's out of five minutes of that clump. Restarts first and 20. And Pennix that quick release. And on the run, there goes London. got the first down in 21 yards. Quick release you were just showing. London on the business end of that. I don't know what happened to Isaiah Rogers on the end of it. Okay, they're going to make the play, but Rogers just lets him go. Kind of just pushed him towards the first down. Nicely done, though. Well executed. They had everybody up. They were going to bring the pressure and Pennix had an answer. 15 targets. Crystal London in week one. Just four tonight for a couple of big ones. One in each half. And Algier runs it near midfield and that clock down is 6.15 to go. And an injury for the Vikings. Gabriel Murphy, linebacker brought up for this game, is down. The latest player to get hurt, first year man out of UCLA. Only played one game last year against the Falcons. Reached that left leg and just walked off under his own power. And the training staff takes it to the 10th floor. Look. Well, they've come prepared to try and enjoy the opening night here at U.S. Bank Stadium, but the Vikings have not been able to deliver. Minnesota limited to just two field goals and 165 yards. Atlanta has it second and six right around midfield. Charlie Werner, that tight end on the move, and blocking again, paving the back round here. Down the sideline for the first down at the 37-yard line. Such a good block. You called it not only one, but you get the second one, and that's what the great ones do. Charlie Werner was a guy who had like 80% of his plays or blocks, and then down the field as well. The one thing that I saw out of Atlanta's offense a week ago was that they were making blocks at the wide receiver position. A little bit like the Rams, a little like the 49ers. That whole system is where this all came from, and they're executing those blocks downfield, too. Now Kier into the secondary, a 20-yard lob. Pulled down by Theo Jackson, and now the chunks are getting bigger in terms of yards for Atlanta. Ryan Newsel to center. Watch him come out and come back and get this second block. It's always the first one's great, but then that linebacker comes shooting through there, Eric Wilson, and he was able to peel off at the last second, get him, and that's what popped that play. Folks saw that run and headed to the exits. Go, go, go, go. Yes, man. Minnesota defense has been terrific in the red zone, keeping Atlanta out of the end zone. Must do here. Out here for a couple of trips. I love when a team has a week where they struggle and say, that's not us, we're going to fix it. And Raheem Mars told us last night, we're going to run the ball effectively as the Vikings take their first time out. And have they ever. 31 runs for Atlanta tonight. 196 yards. Part of the reason they're up not. You don't usually lose a division game in overtime and feel better about what's going on. But if you're a Giants fan, you have to. That was an entertaining back-and-forth game. And the offense showed some life. Yeah, and you think for Kansas City, well, of course, they're going to bounce back against the Giants. But not so fast, my friend, as someone used to say. Oh, great Mr. Porceau. Second and nine for the Falcons. Pijon Robinson stopped by Ivan Pace. Minnesota using their timeouts here. Trying to do whatever they can to keep their hopes alive. If it was a left-handed thrower, all balls, whether they're punted or thrown, have a little fade to them. And maybe that's the reason why, but I'll bet you if I asked one of these guys, they wouldn't even know. The different rotation of the football coming out from a righty and a lefty. Third and seven. No run at Robinson. Going to bounce it. Got away from three tackles. Put his head down and got within a half yard of the first down of all of his runs tonight. There have been some impressive ones. That one may take the cake. I mean, that is 3-1. Two. One more. Three. Man. That's fun to watch. I mean, what did he gain? Six yards? But that was a lot of work. I like watching him play. Final timeout taken. by Minnesota, 143 yards now for Robinson on the night. But a quiet one for Justin Jefferson. And you just have to wonder what he's thinking. And we know he's a team player, and, you know, we've heard all this stuff from Kevin O'Connell about how good his spirit's been, but you just have to wonder if he's getting a little frustrated right now. I'm sure they all are. I think so too. Fourth and one at Minnesota. Out of timeouts. So Atlanta says, why not go for it down here. Try to get the jump. And he did. I believe. Offside they got it. Yes. And that was a really good play by Jake Matthews too. As soon as he jumped off sides, he moved. neutral zone infraction defense number 61 five yard penalty it results in a first half a lot of Jalen Redman for his play tonight but that time mistake keeps the Falcons going on offense right over here as soon as Raymond Redman is going to jump across the line of scrimmage just enough and that was a good job there by Jake Matthews to react let the official call it even if they called it on Matthews go ahead and kick the field goal just enough life right floors can't move we can't move in that situation and they did so Atlanta needed one of these leading drives done just now here the four Vikings powerless to stop it you let it just keeping it on the ground and maximizing the time off the play clock as well and closing in on their first win of this season. And I just keep thinking about what the Falcons were telling us. Zach Robinson, their offensive coordinator, said, I've never experienced anything like it. I kept having offensive linemen and our blockers coming in and apologizing. Like, we just messed it up. Don't change anything. We're good. Keep doing what you're doing. We messed it up, and they came out and answered tonight. And Algier walks into the end zone for the game's first touchdown. You know, it's interesting that they just let that happen. I think there's a strong argument to be made. Let's see how this looks. Does anybody really try? No, not at all. They let them score because now, what is it, two touchdowns does get you back in this game. If they kick, our success will be 16 points. So we are still mathematically alive, especially without timeouts. Algier had 12 touchdowns last year total. A career high. Gets one here. Extra point added. So still a two-score game for the Atlanta Falcons. Did the damage on that drive. 12 plays and 83 yards. Algier deserves some credit. Arthur Plank's happy. His team up 16 late fourth. This game without left tackle just in school. He has left the game with a concussion. Also of note, Aaron Jones. He's on the sideline. No helmet. Trying to pump guys off. But he is questionable with a hamstring injury. Some injuries to watch for this on the offensive side. In addition to the defensive injuries for the Vikings, welcome Cincinnati in here a week from today. And, of course, the Joe Burrow injury is something that everybody will be paying attention to over the next couple of days. And then the Vikings go overseas for back-to-back games. It has been a really poor second half offensively. There are the possessions for Minnesota. So, I mean, unless things drastically turn around, we have seen one good quarter, really good, and seven not good. And, you know, this is a really good team. This is a 14-win team from a season ago, and they played offense better than this. Well, that was the conversation with this Vikings team this year. They drafted J.J. McCarthy, had him here last year. Dealing with the injuries, spotting the ball back at the 30-yard line here for the moment as that kickoff setup movement cost five yards. Instead of the 35 ball, comes to the 30. Would it be an experienced quarterback around a team ready to win? Or go with McCarthy, pass incomplete as he got popped, trying to find Jordan Mason. Well, let's talk about it, Mike. I mean, Sam Darnold we know about, right? He's off to Seattle. Daniel Jones had a chance, had him here, had a chance to keep him. He's doing great in Indiana. And we've seen Kirk Cousins. He had a chance to be here as well. And don't forget Aaron Rodgers. Aaron Rodgers wanted to come here. But they really put all their eggs in one basket, right? And they really believe in J.J. McCarthy. and I guarantee you that hasn't changed because of one football game. But it does ratchet up the pressure now a bit. Cousins was here, of course, two years ago, had the Achilles tear. He was playing at an MVP level the first seven weeks of the season before getting injured at Green Bay. Hopkins in the catch. Out of bounds around the 44-yard line. That's the first one for Hopkinson. And when you had Cousins here, they had to make the decision coming off the Achilles, Are they going to give them the long-term deal? They did not. We chronicled the success last year with Sam Darnold. But you see Kirk Cousins, as you see these two teams playing, he's been an opening day starter, 21-2-3-4 for these two teams, and is now the backup for Pennix in Atlanta. We've seen a lot of great quarterbacks that didn't go so well in year one. Carthy escaping and now throwing on the run. And there's Jefferson, completes the 36-yard line. Three minutes left. Without timeout, the Vikings' lone hope would be recovering an onside kick after a score. Still alive with 2.44 to go. No pressure. He should have time. Flag is down. McCarthy taking a shot downfield. It's going to be intercepted. I mentioned the flag was down. Carter thought he had a free play. Xavier Watts was back there for the pick. But the penalty's on Minnesota. And that's going to be Watts' first NFL interception. Illegal shift. Offense. Number 19. That penalty's declined. First down Atlanta. The Falcons will take over. Third turnover in the night for Minnesota. And Atlanta's going to get out of here with a victory in all likelihood. Not a bad strategy trying to get the ball to Justin Jefferson, but, I mean, it just wasn't close. And, you know, Jefferson may have slowed down a little bit or thought he got held. He was making, gesturing something at the end of that play. But we are seeing a much improved Atlanta Falcons defense at the very, very least. Xavier Watts is they are pumped about him. They think he is going to be an all-pro. Two-time consensus. First team All-America at Notre Dame. 13 interceptions in his two years and the learning curve continues here. To work with with J.J. McCarthy. Here's the run into the 10 for Algiers. This will take us down to the Two-minute warning, and here's what happened. Little corner route here. Man underneath, there was a little tug of the jersey, and I think that's exactly what Jefferson was trying to get done. But that thing was launched over the top and just did not have a chance. And way out of nowhere, you saw Bates come flying. 11 for 21. Two picks. No fourth quarter comeback tonight, and a big night for the Atlanta Falcons, who were so close to getting four consecutive years with a quarterback and a receiver and a running back and a tight end, and they've got the folks around them. But that defense will walk away tonight, whether it was the inability of Minnesota or the improved play of this Atlanta defense. Walk away impressed with this Falcon unit, getting a road win here tonight. And they will take on the Panthers next week. Carolina 0-2 starts of the season. Then the Commanders will be at Mercedes-Benz to buy, and then they'll play the Bills, and we'll see Atlanta out in Santa Clara in Week 7 against the now 2-0 49ers. And I mentioned with Cincinnati coming in here next week, and then two international games. It says at, but the Pittsburgh game is in Dublin, and the Cleveland game will be in London. So the Vikings are packing the passport after the game next Sunday here at U.S. Bank. Has anybody ever done that? Last year, Jacksonville, I know, did. Two in a row? Back-to-back. Somebody else may have last year as well. Out here to the right. Yard short. Vikings powerless to stop it. Run it down here. So it's one of those nights, Chris, where, you know, you're going to now lean on the veterans around this team to set a tone, if you're Minnesota, of what's next. And in the league, it's relentless. It comes around quick. Yeah, and you just have to acknowledge what you are. A lot of this is going on. I kind of feel like that myself. And it's just going to take a little while. I mean, it just is. Troy Aikman, John Elway, we've seen a lot of these guys, the greatest of the great, struggle early in their careers, and yet look where they end up. And that's going to have to happen for this football team as well. They knew there was going to be a growth. They were hoping it happened all in the fourth quarter last week. But it didn't. and now the pressure's back on. Timeout taken by the Falcons as they ran the clock all the way down. They punted away here with 28 seconds. And their offensive line injuries, right, on top of that. We've seen veteran quarterbacks struggle when they don't have the protection in front of them, especially that center handling things. But it's his second start, and that's going to be the issue that they are going to deal with. Carson Wentz is the backup here. It's not time to throw everything out. But like you said, so far eight quarters, it's one yay, seven nay right now. Well, and let's give them every benefit of the doubt, right? It was Monday night, you're back late, short week, have a baby. You're back here on national television again against a really good defense that has drafted a lot of players and has a really good coordinator now. And it didn't work out. So you know what you do? You flush it. You just got to get rid of it. and then you go get ready for the next one. That's the way this league works. Coming after Bradley Pitt. Veteran just gets it out of there. 46-yard kick is muffed by Price. Recovered by the Falcons, whose special teams deserve another checkmark on the night because they've been fabulous all night long on coverage. Mike Ford Jr., who has at least two special teams tackles, recovers the muff. That ends this one. Heard a little screaming and yelling down there. A lot of times when you're the punt returner, they will do that. They'll scream and yell. I'm telling you, anything goes, you just can't hit them. I can remember Bill Parcells doing that, standing back by his punt return, just screaming at the guy, doing anything he can. It is the worst job on earth. I remember being a punt returner in college in Alabama running 17 All-Americans at me down there. That was impossible. Can I write that down as the last quote of the night? Worst job on earth. Well, probably. I know what you're saying. Those two guys just had an office right across from each other. The Shawlman-Face Super Bowl Rams team won the defensive, won the offensive coordinator. Familiarity with the staff. Respect as well. During this battle, McCarthy won the one at the College Football Playoff National Championship. This regular season meeting won between these two QBs in the NFL. Won by Michael Pettix, Jr. and the Falcons. The Chevrolet postgame. comes up right after these minutes.
