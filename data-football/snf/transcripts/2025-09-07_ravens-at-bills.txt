 The legends of Buffalo, like Andre Reid, help get the fans ready. Where else would you rather be than right here, right now, with a chicken wing around your neck? The rookie, Tyler Luke, replacing Baltimore's longtime kicker, Justin Tucker, ready for his NFL debut. Brendan Codrington is the lead return man for the Bills. He's back along with Ty Johnson. It is late October, chill in the air, 57 degrees here on the seventh night of September. Orchard Park ready for the last time in this stadium, a season opener. Off we go here from Orchard Park. From the 10, down the sideline, near midfield as Luke pushes him out of bounds. So a great start for Buffalo, terrific field position for the Bills offense. Josh Allen, Bill Pokes. James Cook, Georgia. Joshua Palmer, University of Tennessee. Kalushka, Boise State. Keon Coleman, Opelous Catholic. Dalton Cade, Vanderburg Elementary. Deion Dawkins, you already should know University. David Edwards, Wisconsin. Connor McGovern, Penn State. Osiris Torrance, St. Helena High School. Spencer Brown, Lennox, Iowa. That's the same offensive line start almost the entire season for Buffalo last year. This offense was second in points to Detroit. Josh Allen rolling from midfield. First toss is complete. Game of seven to his tight end. Dawson Knox fights for the ball with Kyle Hamilton. But it's a pickup of seven on first down for the seventh year, man. Josh Allen, as Chris mentioned at the top, MVP of the league last year. What a 12-months it's been. Married this offseason a few months after winning that MVP. taking the Bills to the AFC title game for the second time. He is always there for this team. His 119th straight start, if you include the playoffs, he begins season number eight here tonight. Second and two on the ground. James Cook. Side of the board in the Buffalo first down for Cook. A terrific season last year and has been rewarded with a big contract extension. Yeah, we talk a lot about Derrick Henry, but James Cook with the exact same number of rushing touchdowns a season ago with 16 Tied Jameer Gibbs and Henry as well so they can throw it and they certainly can run it behind this tremendous offensive line 14 might be new if you have to follow the bills in preseason Tyrell Shavers Was in motion Josh, who wants to take a hit early, gets a couple against the Baltimore defense. Naminadevike, McKay North High School. Travis Jones, Connecticut. Adafi Owe, Penn State. Roquan Smith, Georgia. Trenton Simpson, Clemson. Kyle Vannoy, Unk University. Nate Wiggins, Clemson. Marlon Humphrey, Alabama. Kyle Hamilton, Notre Dame. Malachi Starks, Georgia. Chittabet, Alizia, Emo State, Nigeria. Rick Starks there, the second to last player introduced. First round pick in the draft. He's pairing with Kyle Hamilton. And that back line, this defense got much better as the season got longer a year ago. Second and seven. Allen to the air. Scanning, coming back. And it's nearly intercepted. Almost in the hands of that aforementioned rookie Starks on the pass intended for Khalil Shakir. I think Josh may be just a little jacked up. Going to get the route right across here. And really a relatively easy throw for him. Just missed it a little high and almost cost him a pick. You can imagine, first game out, the raw emotion of playing against this team again. They picked up right where they did from the playoffs. Everybody's a little jumpy. Speaking of which, Namde Matabike moved. Spencer Brown trying to catch him while he was in the neutral zone. Carl Johnson, the line judge, is talking to John Hussey. This is on the Caps in. Defense, number 92. Five-yard penalty, third down. This Baltimore team penalized a lot last year. Now it's third and short. Once they jump into that neutral zone, then you are allowed to flinch at that point. Monday, Monday, Monday. So now third and a long two. Ty Johnson in the back. He's got it. Technically a run, but it's a good play inside the 20 to the 15-yard line. Gain a 16 and a first down for Johnson. The one thing you want to do with the Ravens defense is get them going in the wrong direction. You fake a run away, a little quick toss the other way. And the other thing it does, Mike, is it really slows this pass rush down. You get a lot of what Lamar does to you on the offensive side as well, which is a lot of linemen pulling and crossing, and it just unsettles the defense. They're not as aggressive. Blocking downfield by the receivers. Ray Davis now in it running back. From the 14, Allen Davis. Will not get to that block. Terrific play coming up from the linebacking spot by Trenton Simpson. will limit the play to no game. So anytime you're playing these guys, you're going to see these offensive linemen moving a lot. And you think back to the Tom Brady days and all the different things where they would pull one way and then throw back to Gronk across on the other side. Those kinds of plays early in the ballgame just set the tone, and it just gets you back on your heels. On second down, Allen looking at a zone. Touchdown. In the traffic, Dalton Kincaid is there for six. There was a whole lot of home baby on that one. And Doc Kincaid zipped it in front of the safeties right behind the linebackers. And it was almost as if Josh Allen on that drive came out angry in some way. I mean, that was dynamic. It was on time and some beautiful throws. 41-year-old Matt Prater is kicking because Tyler Bass is on the injured list. He adds the extra point. What is that? Did he do a hum babe on that? Yeah, he did. First one of the year. Kincaid to touchdown 7-0 Buffalo our head-to-head yet again Josh Allen came out ready to make a statement I'm pretty darn sure Lamar's gonna do the same thing well he's thinking the same thing on that sideline that drive started at the midfield mark because of a 41-yard kickoff return and thus far through week one with the adjustment and And a lot of folks anticipating more kickoff returns. We are seeing plenty more. Three of every four kickoff returns so far in week one. Matt Prater to kick it off for Buffalo. Justice Hill, Rasheen Ali, back deep to Rasheed. Ali from the nine will bring it back. He is stopped just across the 30. That's where the Baltimore offense will take over. Lamar Jackson, Louisville. Derrick Henry, Alabama. Zay Flowers, Boston College. Rashad Bateman, Minnesota. DeAndre Hopkins, Clemson. Mark Andrews, Oklahoma. Ronnie Stanley, Notre Dame. Andrew Voorhees, USC. Tyler Lenderbaum, Iowa. Daniel Favrela, Minnesota. Roger Rosengarten, University of Washington. A couple of significant names missing. Tight end Isaiah Likely is supposed to camp with a foot injury. Patrick required the fullback, but they've got that back Derek Henry Second to say block Barkley and rushing last year the pickup of five on first down Baltimore jumping into no huddle Right back to Henry inside for a yard no more Lamar Jackson when you look at the stats and Chris mentioned the tough very easily could have won his third MVP last year and it's not just the 41 and 4 it's the other numbers too and what's odd is he was the first team all-throw quarterback ahead of Josh Allen yet the same 50 voters voted Allen the MVP Jackson second that's old little motivation it's about writing a new chapter here tonight everybody up for the Buffalo Bills on defense they're crowding that line of scrimmage. Third and three for Rush out of the backfield just as ill. Big hit at the sideline. It all depends on the mark. As he's close to the first down, Christian Benford was the player over there for Buffalo. He is their number one corner and was slow to get up after that hit. They don't need that. They're missing a lot of corners out here. Dorian Strong, a rookie, is going to start opposite But Tredavious White can't play Maxwell Harrison their number one draft pick can't play in this one So we'll keep an eye on how Benford store marked as a first down at the 41 Jackson quick to mark Andrews gets it back in his hands gain of five so much made last year the playoff game The two-point would be tying conversion that answers was not able to hold on to to and that drop led to the Ravens getting knocked out by the Bills like I I had a fumble one time in the Super Bowl and you want to know when he's gonna forget about that moment his entire life that'll be with him you just have to learn to play with it and move on that's all you can do time for meeting talk more about mark as the night goes on Henry for about two yards. Derrick Henry, 31 years old. Had a remarkable season last year, Chris, that was overshadowed by what Saquon Barkley did in Philadelphia. I mean, it's unbelievable to put up those numbers and say anybody overshadowed you, especially when you're 6'3 and 250 pounds. But here we go, another third and three for Lamar Jackson. You always have to stop him first. Hill, fake Jackson keep, first down Lamar Jackson. Like you said, he's the one who can hurt you the most. And a dozen yards for Lamar and a first down for Baltimore. Always going to be one person unblocked out here, and Lamar is simply going to read him. Once he took that step down inside, Lamar knew exactly what he was going to do. But I think with both of these quarterbacks, When you're talking about red zone, when you're talking about short yardage, stop them from running first is job one. 41, Jackson will drop back. Everything coverage. He comes back to what's wide open. That's Derrick Henry for about 13 yards and a first down. Taylor Rapp over there making the stop with Dorian Williams for Buffalo. We talked a lot this week about the growth of Lamar Jackson watch him he wants to go right there Didn't like it knew immediately where his check down was maybe two or three years ago He takes off and runs with that football that is not who he is. He is a pocket passer That's what he wants to be and he's very good at it. We'll give you a few numbers before the night's up 28. Run for Hill. Four yards or so. The ball came out for a second, but Hill was down, marked down, so no big deal. See 97 there getting off the pile. Buffalo Blue, that's Joey Bosa. A new addition to this Buffalo defense. First time he's ever played a game without a lightning bolt on the side of his head. Chargers whole career. He is a very good one and not just the pass rusher either he is a hammer over there on the edge to try and slow this running game down. Bill's bringing pressure Jackson looking to take off but they trapped him in there flag is down as Jackson's down. That flag coming at the top of the screen. Greg Russo led this Buffalo team in sacks last year. Corral Jackson, however, looks like this one is on the Bills. Holding. Defense number 43. I got penalty. Automatic. First down. It's the rookie corner starting tonight. Dorian Strong. two six-round picks starting at cornerback strong out on the outside against their best and say flowers that was enough mouth guard came out the whole deal strong a rookie out of Virginia Tech pick 177 in the draft and starting a block is to be white the veteran is back with the Bills is out tonight with a groin injury. I think they saw the man coverage. Jackson flushed, chased, on the run, goes back across his body, incomplete. Trying to reel in Jake Flowers, who is running along with him, and strong covering as well. Mike, just like they did in the playoff win, the Buffalo Bills are coming back to their man coverage now and blitzing. They did not like just sitting back in that first game and watching Derrick Henry run up and down the field. So here you have Lamar Jackson, unafraid to make changes at the line of scrimmage. That's a new aspect of this offense now that hasn't been in in years past. We'll get into it as the night goes on. The Bills have a lot of youth on defense, including both defensive tackles in there are rookies out of this draft. The hand to Flowers. Trying to turn the corner. Cut inside Matt Milano. He's brought down Bob's safety. Cole Bishop. A couple shy of the first down. Another third and short on this drive for Baltimore. Probably the toughest loss for the Ravens before the playoff game a season ago was Zay Flowers was unable to play in those two playoff games. So he is the guy that is the electric part of this offense. So the more times they can get him touches of any kind the better off they are Third 33 of the drive The bill showed pressure And got Baltimore to Flitz. Full start. Offense number 70. And that's going to do. 3-9. Roger Rosengarten. Second year tackle. Got a lot going on. The crowd's going crazy. First game of the year. A lot of emotion out here. The Bills showing flitzes. You know, it's just, this is a big game. I feel late. It's a big game. The end of the year, we'll see. We'll see if this is a big game. Now third and eight. Jackson trying to get away. Trying to escape. Cannot do it. And Oliver. That may be one of the best sacks I've seen in a long time against Lamar Jackson. Watch him just wiggle his way through here. And even when he got to Lamar, this is usually not over. Pushes his way back. You've got to make that tackle off the stiff arm. Got it done. Big time. Big time play that time by Ed Oliver. And a big loss of 15. Turns the first field goal for the six-round draft pick out of Arizona. Tyler Luke into a long one. replacing Justin Tucker first NFL kick from 52 yards Luke knocks in the field goal Oliver gets to Jackson and turns the drive it's a three for Baltimore will be the name of the new one right across the parking lot more on that a bit later on but that has added extra energy to one of the most involved fan bases in the league this bouncing kickoff is fielded on the hop Johnson able to Sneak through. The 28-29. Keeps going. Gets six more. Ty Johnson. A nice return to the 35. And that's where Buffalo will start drive two with Josh Allen. Of course, we had a chance to visit with Josh. We got up here on Friday after the Thursday night opener in Philadelphia. And it's just been fun to watch the progress of Josh Allen. From when he came in, wild, throwing the ball around. Guy out of Wyoming, junior college, to where he is now. MVP of the league and the face of this franchise and married With Haley around you could tell he's just a happy guy It really has you can feel the difference with it Little difference between the two and the movies they like he likes a little more action Omaha, Jack. Second and a short two. It'll be Cook to the left. And not much there. Good pressure by a guy, Chris, who you've been watching in the offseason. Travis Jones on that front for Baltimore. Yeah, Travis Jones has really made a bit of a name for himself in just the physical presence. But the things he did at the combine, his size, strength, speed, something else. Just go quick on third down, and Baltimore is ready for it. And the second effort is stopped as well. So Cook gets stopped on third down in that Baltimore defense. Stops Buffalo on third and short with Jones doing it again. And if you're going to beat this football team, here's where you have to beat them. Right up front. Matt Abike all over that one. Who was that? I couldn't see the other one. I'm going to guess it was probably Travis Jones. Yeah. Those two guys are just very, very difficult to move, and they set the tone for the entire defense. New puncher for Buffalo. Brad Robbins. Michigan man. That hit a Raven. I think it did. The gunner waiting for it on the bounce. With Sam Franklin Jr. Can't advance it. But if it didn't back hitting Raven first, it would be Buffalo ball at the 14. The officials will discuss. It hit the ground and it seemed to bounce up on Keon Martin's arm. It hits Buffalo first. It hits the knee of the gunner, Franklin, first. And then the arm of the Ravens. It'll be Baltimore ball there. They're rolling on the field. The ball was first touched by Buffalo number 28. Therefore, it is Baltimore's ball. First down, timeout. A little bit of an exhale for the undrafted rookie, Keon Martin. second drive for the Ravens beginning at their own 15 Derrick Henry running to the right into daylight a game of 11 at first down 26 yard lock so many times with Derrick Henry you got to stay on the move to try and just beat him at different spots in the gaps but right now what we're seeing is that if they can get Derrick Henry going, everything comes off of that. So far all the pressure in this game has been on Lamar Jackson. They need to settle back into what they do, which is sort of a run first approach. Jackson has time and five hours open. Lost the ball and got back on it at the 46 yard line. Gained a 20 and a first down. Melissa Stark. Yeah, Mike, before Lamar Jackson just took the field for this drive, he was on the sideline, the athletic training staff, working on his right hand, on his throwing hand, the right thumb. It appears that he had a cut at the base of his nail. They put some sterile super glue on it. He grabbed his helmet, and he took the field, which is something to keep an eye on. He was trying to keep Oliver away from him. I would highly recommend he changes that style, taking that right hand off the ball and the stiff arm would be too valuable. And with the quarter here, running for Henry for a yard or two, the linebacker, General Bernard, will become a captain and a voice of this Buffalo defense with the tackle that will bring this opening quarter to an end. A rematch. The divisional playoff won by Buffalo. The Ravens had a blowout win. Cover zero look unless they come out, but pure one-on-one, they do come out of it. Second and eight, Jackson's underneath. Bob Fiber shot Bateman against this Buffalo defense. Greg Russo. Miami. Ed Oliver. University of Houston. Dick 1 Jones. Penn State. Joey Bosa. The Ohio State University. Matt Milano. Boston College. Terrell Bernard. Report High School. Doreen Strong. Virginia Tech. Taron Johnson. Weber State. Taylor Rapp. Washington. Cole Bishop. Utah. Christian Benford. Illinois. So changes on that back end with Buffalo, that secondary to be tested here in the early part of the season. Another third and short for the Ravens. Justice Hill in the back. And Jackson will keep it. Outrace Bosa. Outrace Bernard. And get a first down, probably a down at the 30-yard line. Pick up 17 for Lamar. You just can't do that. Here's the unblocked guy again. and you're going to get in here, and you're going to get out there. This guy has to stay outside. And Bosa's going to figure that out in a hurry. The value of Lamar Jackson, what they've done with this offense, Chris, just next level, next level. John Harbaugh telling us last night, this is almost Lamar 3.0 in the evolution over his now eight seasons as the Ravens quarterback. Henry to the secondary Henry to the end zone touchdown The power running of Derrick Henry for 30 yards puts the Ravens on top They made the switch to Cole Bishop back at the safety position And anytime you get on the back end one-on-one tackling opportunities against Derrick Henry You can just about forget about it. There really has not been anybody. He didn't even get to the legs He just got to sort of the forearm shiver that Henry gave him there and that's when he can be just so Intimidating almost forced to play too deep Mike because one guy can't Punches through the extra point that is the danger of this team back-to-back plays you see it But Mark Jackson takes off for 18. And then Derrick Henry. Get out of my way. I'm bound for the end zone. Making more NFL history. Panopy is going to mitigate the wins that have been so much a factor here. The folks in western New York have no idea what's coming their way next year. That place is going to be a palace. And no fan base deserves a palace to watch football in. more than these folks who've been out in the cold and the weather and the wind for a half century. It was a treat to get that tour. Return here for the Bills, and Conrad did spill at the 20-yard line on special teams with Jake Hummel. So Cole Bishop takes over for DeMar Hamlin, and watch what happens when you try to take on the big guy, Derrick Henry. He just sizes you up, right, and then throws that left jab. You want it from this angle? Here we go. Boop. Down and out. I mean, it's embarrassing. Honestly, he's a professional athlete. Weighs 207 pounds, and he just got tossed aside on that one. 23-yard line. Out quick and dropped by Keon Coleman, the second-year receiver. The Bills are expecting a lot of this year with his first target on the game. That touchdown, I mentioned NFL history, Chris. For Derrick Henry, he breaks the tie with the late, great Jim Brown. Now 107 rushing touchdowns, sixth alone in NFL history. Brown did it in 118 games this game, 137 for King Henry. We've seen his workout regimen. He's going to play as long as he wants to. I mean, this guy has really turned into something special, and he definitely wanted to be a part of this Ravens football team. He fits it perfectly. Bill's offense sputtering at the moment. Allen gets it complete for the new addition. Joshua Palmer, who was signed as a free agent after his time with the Chargers, it'll set up third down for Buffalo. It was one of the really big discussion points in the offseason, whether or not the Buffalo Bills were going to try and enhance the wide receiver position. They did with a couple of free agents, Elijah Moore, Josh Palmer, but not so much in the draft. And they did completely replenish the defensive line on the other side though, which they needed No battery, battery No battery No battery No battery No battery No Quick Touch the back up But then the ball comes out After the next tackle it goes out of bounds as Kincaid have it Conversation about where it is Still on the catch Bumble forward out of bounds Fourth down Kyle Hamilton over there Elvin the nugget from Kincaid. It's back-to-back three and outs for the Buffalo offense. I'll tell you, Kyle Hamilton's really been something, hasn't he? Just got paid a huge contract. But I don't know of anybody on defense that can play more positions than that guy has. What incredible value. And it was when he got moved to safety last year, this defense woke up and made their run. Robbins with the kick. 25 by the rookie Luzhante Wester tries to reverse field and is brought down. Cam Lewis continues to be a good special teamer for Buffalo makes the stop. Ravens the lead. They take over. I mentioned Chris, this is the third time in about 50 weeks these teams are playing and you see that familiarity. They're shifting to different gears against each other very early in week one. They're staying with that eight man front up there to try and get after Henry but single high leaves you in a vulnerable spot both in the past game and the one game if he has to tackle one-on-one. Five out of the pattern caught inside by Rashad Bateman to the 37-yard line, a half dozen. As the pushing goes on with Christian Bentford who made the tackle after the play. I'll tell you though, Rashad Bateman, his emergence in the last couple years has really just made such a huge difference for this team. He had three touchdowns 40-plus yards a season ago in between he and Zay Flowers, and now add in DeAndre Hopkins. They have receivers here they really haven't had in the past for Lamar. We haven't seen Hopkins yet. Finished the season with the AFC champion Chiefs last year. Now part of this Ravens outfit. Henry Cation, powerful, and taking off. Another big Derrick Henry run to the 20 and the 13-yard line. 51 on that carry for Henry. So they have to go into a 2-D because they want two bites at the apple to try and tackle this big guy. That didn't work either. There were so many times in that playoff game, Mike, that when they were able to get him on the ground, one safety would hit from one side, the other safety from the other side. Look at the blockers. They got down the field there. Roger Rosengarten, the tackle, had to be 10 yards down the field making that key block. Officially 49. He's already over 100 yards. Seven rushes, 101 yards, in addition to the 13 in the air. It's a side run for a three. He's sent you back out of Marshall. Takes him just shy of the 10-yard line. He is human. He needs to catch his breath. I don't think so. You're gonna see that both of these teams and especially at the tackle position doing a lot of pulling very few teams Do that really but these teams had four guys that can pull in any direction And it's so much a part of their offense and it makes it so hard to read those counters by Lamar going the other way Remains the back Mark Andrews through a great block and Lamar Jackson and the Ravens have scored again with a long quick drive I don't know what you do I don't have to design the defense Everybody's going this way back there and now here comes Lamar out that way And even if you do get these guys one-on-one, you can't tackle them. They're just so efficient. Jackson wasn't even touched on that play. That's the power of having Derrick Henry in your backfield, on your team. It just shakes up the defense. Tyler Luke getting used to kicking a lot of extra points. There's going to be many more of those this year. The power and speed of Henry. The speed of Lamar Jackson. The Ravens, three possessions, three scores. Up 10. Baltimore's had a game's worth of big plays on the last two drives. Mark Jackson, Derrick Henry. And then offensive line making a statement. Bouncing kick, fielded by Codrington, comes to the left side. And gets out around the 30-yard line. And this Buffalo offense, back-to-back possessions, three and out. Chris it's a different kind of pressure because of the way Jackson and the Ravens have gotten started. It really is time for the MVP now to settle everybody down. They've been trying to do some things with some really quick throws. Get it out of his hands. But we also know sometimes just like Lamar. Josh Allen can jump start an offense with his legs as well. See if we see some of that. Ty Johnson starts this drive as the back. He got a toss from the 30. He'll pick up about seven yards as he went into Kyle Hamilton, that do defensive player for the Ravens That was a good job by Ty Johnson just hanging on to the ball he that pitch almost came all the way through and Was able to pick up six Do a nice job spinning through their running backs Davis Johnson no one played over half the snaps last year. They stay fresh They're all productive Elijah Moore, the motion man, has got it. And he's got a Buffalo first down at their own 45-yard line. He came over from Cleveland, fifth-year man. Yeah, we got a chance to watch practice the other day, and it was Elijah Moore who was becoming a little bit more and more a favorite target of Josh Allen. Certainly a guy that can play a second-round pick back in 21s, bounces around a little bit with the Jets and Cleveland. but he gives them an added weapon, and Zachary Orr, he is, that guy really came on, I thought, from a defensive coordinator standpoint, really grew into the job in the second half of the season. Two coordinators, you just saw, they're both in their second year in the league, both in their 30s. Allen back, and that's deflected, it's an incomplete forward pass. The hands were in there, I think it was Broderick Washington first, who was closing in on Josh. They have just so many weapons inside to come get you. And, you know, we were talking with some of the offensive linemen, Deion Dawkins, Spencer Brown, the two tackles, and they said they don't say a word up there. There's no trash talking. They just come after you. They're just pounding on you for four quarters, and there's sort of a mutual respect here between these two teams. physical approach to this game. After the incompletion, second and ten. Check it down to Cook. Open field. The Ravens rally to the ball. Starting with Nate Wiggins, or rather Chita Bay Wuzier, beg your pardon, the corner who was over there first and who set up third and long for Buffalo. And right now, Baltimore is just forcing them to check down. They're taking away this middle part of the field. But remember, that's where they're so good. Dalton Kincaid, they're tied in. Just had a sensational rookie year. Came back the following season. Had some injury issues. Really wasn't the same after he hurt his knee, even into the playoffs. But if he could start creating some space in the middle of the field, it would really help. Real quick on third down. Allen escaping. Getting away from O.A. Throws on the run. Sideline. It is. Run in by Keon Coleman. Coleman comes over to get it at the 37-yard line. First down, Buffalo. and catch nicely done but that was Josh Allen getting out and getting on the move when he starts getting engaged like that this team's better in 17 they go quick knocks down the sideline room for Smith shoves him out of bounds first down and the Bills crowd back in this one the Ravens defense is just they violently attack everywhere they go. And so you can see what the game plan has been from Joe Brady. Let's get them looking one way, let's get them started one way, and let's quickly throw it behind them. But they're also going at a pace now where this defensive line on opening night, remember they're not in that great of shape yet, it's going to begin to wear down. We're playing at the start of the drive. We toss to the right. Off the first tackle, 13 of seven yards. You can see the speed both sides are playing with. This is a pretty good fight between these teams. Roquan Smith, the tackle. One of the guys that I think has improved almost more than anybody on this Bills team is right there, Spencer Brown, the right tackle. Watch him just hang in there. He is one of those street fighter kind of guys, And that's the kind of guy that you want when you're taking on the Baltimore Ravens Bill his entire time third round takeout of Northern Iowa Stopped a couple of times on third and short Damius Robinson On that defensive front for the Ravens with five and a half left in this first half Ordinarily who knows what the game plan is tonight, but this is all Josh Allen either He's gonna keep it. They're gonna run some power offensive lineman pulling in front of him Or some kind of bootleg and get him out on the edge But get his run threat somehow involved in this game Talking important to close Shakir who took the hand up and has the first down down to the 12-yard line Shakir who is so often on the same page with Allen They've got three chemistry Does it on the ground Watch this block coming across here by Deion Dawkins That was a very clever little play And they're executing this quick strike really well That is, they really needed this Because their defense had to have a little bit of a break They just looked like they were about to break down On the left And flip it to two-zero 0. 0. 0. From the 12. Play 10 of the drive. Allen, look at end zone. Nothing there. As Coleman was going for it. Kyle Hamilton on the defense. One of the things we saw from Josh Allen a season ago was that he got the ball out of his hands so much quicker than what he had. And because of that, the number of interceptions that he threw dropped from 18 and 23 down to 6. So I think he's trying to be efficient with the ball, efficient with the offense. Alert it, alert it, alert it. But he's still dangerous. Reboot it, reload it. Reboot it. Reboot it. Reboot it. Reboot it. Reboot it. We run it once so far tonight. Inside run with Cooper upon Smith. He's there at the 10-yard line. with their rookie linebacker, Teddy Buchanan. It was a big third down coming up before the Bills. It was interesting. James Cook, the running back, was sort of barely involved down in the red zone. Very rarely had a running touchdown. But this past year, 16 of them. So I think that he's proven that it's not all about size, that sometimes people just have a feel for it. And he's sort of one of those gliders, more than the heavy cuts. And sometimes that works in the red zone. He's out third down back time Johnson in here third Nate Company came to help The bills will go for a field goal Big-time play that time by Teddy Buchanan the rookie who is basically at least splitting time with Trenton Simpson, who was benched a year ago. But for Teddy Buchanan, if he can come in here and solidify that final linebacker spot, of course they got Roquan Smith, and I think they're hoping Teddy Buchanan can take over that other side. A few days ago, Matt Prater took a red eye from Arizona. He was kicking at a high school to stay in shape, was not in anyone's camp. and the 41-year-old veteran in his 19th year in the league. Now in as Tyler Bass is on IR for at least four weeks with an injury. Prater gets the job done. Bills drive gets three points. Back to a one-score game. Over at Canal Side, going down the Buffalo River. That was the Bills Mafia, their annual boat parade. It is all about the Bills up here. There's a great buildup, of course, this team that went to four consecutive Super Bowls back in the 90s. Jim Kelly, Thurman Thomas, Andre Reid, Mark Levy. And now this team that has been very good and very close trying to get the Bills back to the big game. And this fan base just desperate to host that Super Bowl parade one day. Will that day be in February of 2026? That's the Mafia hopes. Raiders kick. In play. So a return by Ali across the 30. Ali, nice move inside the 40. Brought that pass to 45 by Dorian Williams. All right, let's take a look at our next-gen stats. Powered by AWS, and why not King Henry? Here we go. The one thing that any professional athlete hates is getting embarrassed. And I don't know of any player in the NFL that embarrasses you more than Derrick Henry. He can simply toss people aside that are big, strong, always been the best player on their team no matter where they've been. But he is just a different breed of cat. Saw that number already. 86 in his 101 yards after contact already. And here comes Moore. Inside the 40 for the 37-yard line. So Henry lit up the bills for 199 in the regular season game last year on his way to that again. Well, here comes the tight end trap down inside here. This is what they scored a touchdown on the last time these two teams played. And right now, it is just not going well for the Buffalo Bills along this defensive line. Huge holes opening up. The new Lamar Jackson with the Ones. Sneaking in before the two-minute warning. Henry with another run. Gets the 32-yard line as the Ravens are on the move as we get inside. The two-minute warning. Baltimore scored on all three drives. Leading by seven. You're watching the NFL kickoff weekend. Presented by YouTube TV. Remind how great Sundays are, right? The NFL season. Man, it was fun. Terrific performances. Marie and the guys will have only analysis for you at the half. Here the Ravens lead by 7 at 2nd and 5. Safety wins coming. The deflection by Russo in the pass is incomplete. Greg Russo got his hands up to force 3rd and 5. Led his team in sacks a season ago with 8. And they have added a lot of depth around him at those positions. But he is still their best out on the edge. DeAndre Hopkins in the game, number 10 in white. He's played five snaps so far, no targets. Timeout Baltimore. We saw the pressure on that last play, Chris, from Cole Bishop. Bishop in with Taylor Rapp as the starters. It was DeMar Hamlin who started the playoff game against the Ravens. Hamlin's still on the team. He's the third safety for now. There he is on the sidelines, covered a couple of kicks from special teams. But Bishop, the second rounder, who they've been trying to get on the field, now in his second year becomes the starter, and Hamlin's a reserve. Well, and Cole Bishop is much more athletic. He's much faster than either DeMar Hamlin or Taylor Rapp. But I'll say this, DeMar Hamlin made some really big tackles against Derrick Henry in that playoff game. At some point, what's hurting you more? the passing game or what Derrick Henry's doing? He had eight tackles, a sack of the forced fumble in that conventional playoff win here in January. Third and five. Bills bringing four. Lamar throws in the middle and is caught. Two receivers there. Dave Flowers slides to the catch. Ravens in the red zone at the 17-yard line. And a timeout taken. Really interesting. You saw the tight end Mark Andrews trying to adjust his route, held on to the catch. Yes, he did. And Zay Flowers is that answer that when teams try to do what Buffalo has done early on here and try and play some man coverage against them, he's the one they can't cover. I mean, he really is. Melissa? Yeah, Mike, there is so much energy down here on the Ravens sideline. And we know this is a revenge game for them. But the hype, the trash-talking, the yelling, the high-fives. And Ravens fans behind the bench chanting MVP for Lamar. And John Harbaugh, after that last touchdown, went over to his offensive line and said, All you, all night. You want to send a message here right from the start. Very confident team always. But you felt that when we visited with the Ravens yesterday. That was a Buffalo timeout each team has to hit lost the football. Bosa knocked it out. He's got it back, but he's taken down for a loss of 15 yards. The linebacker Bernard goes back to make the play, but Bosa forced the fumble. Tremendous play that time by Joey Bosa, and that's what they need. They need a couple of explosive plays on defense. You can't just sit back and let Derrick Henry and Lamar Jackson and save flowers just go one play after another because they're capable of taking it 40 yards So second along coming up we are back in 30 seconds after this from AWS COA WSA I levels up the game Or in this first half Jackson had a 15-yard loss on a sack earlier Bills took the timeout. They're down to one. Second and 25. Top pass, A Flowers. Nowhere to go. They'll go right down. Cut his losses. No game. Timeout McDermott. His last. As Buffalo would like to get the ball back. Because the Ravens get it to start the second half. Yeah, and it forces some decisions as well on the part of the Ravens. Because an incomplete pass would certainly help them coming out of this too. So we were talking, getting ready for the game, about Baltimore. and the volumes of offense they have. This is a defensive coordinator nightmare when it's Ravens week for you, isn't it? It really is. And Todd Monk, and we have to give him a lot of credit. The offensive coordinator, three years here now with the Ravens and what he's done with Lamar. And we've sort of been talking about it a little bit, but he has really opened up the ability of Lamar Jackson now to make changes at the line of scrimmage. They'll have two or three play options, and Lamar can go to any one of those that he wants to. It has just been step by step by step, and Lamar has been eating it up all the way through. Play caller for those college championships in Georgia, doing a great job here in Baltimore. Todd Markman, heck of an offensive coach. Third and 24. Jackson's going to run it. Bosa out there with him. Oliver there as well. And that big loss forced by Bosa on the first play changes the tone of this drive as now Baltimore will let the clock run down to around 45 seconds. Well, it took Joey Bosa a few minutes to figure out how fast Lamar Jackson is, but he's got it wired now. No, no, no, no, no. At least make him stop his feet, and here comes the cavalry. So he burned him a couple of times early, but the old veteran got it figured out. Ravens have options here. They can use a timeout to maximize the time off the play clock, And the game clock and the Buffalo with very little on the back end Tyler loop settles in for the second field goal attempt for 49 yards Operation clean and a loop one more time Knocks it through two field goals two extra points a perfect debut 31 seconds. No timeouts for McDermott and the Bills trying to get on the board again. Sitting up good field position so far. Buffalo could use one of those here. Trying to get it from Ty Johnson. He's well covered by Baltimore. And the Bills will take over to 27 with 25 seconds left. I mean, the hard part is Baltimore is going to get the ball to start the second half. And you don't love your odds with 25 seconds and no timeouts. But I think you've got to be a little aggressive here. We haven't seen any indication yet that the Bills defense is going to be able to shut down this Ravens offense. Matt Crater, who is now kicking here, although he's only been here a couple of days, has more 50-yard field goals than anyone in NFL history. The Bills need about 38 to 40 yards in short order without timeouts. It's a deep drop. And Allen, by in time, ready to swing it downfield. And coming back to catch it is Shakir at the 46. No timeouts. Try to kill it here. And the Bills will get there and kill it with seven seconds left. So Allen's rocket arm and legs by the mashup. That was so good by Shakir. Watch him in the way Mike described it perfectly. That ball was sort of floated up, almost thrown to a spot instead of to a guy. And Shakir's just going to come flying in the picture here and make a diving catch. That is tremendous. That guy has done so much catching the ball yards after the catch. But you can tell Josh Allen just trusts him in a way he doesn't really anybody else on this offense. Baltimore's going to take a timeout here to try to set the defense after that Shakir grab. ball at the 47 so if you do some quick math and say okay can prater do it from 50 and going right to lefty to 53 in warm-ups can you get 12 yards on the sideline in six seconds that's the question right now for joe brady josh allen and company yeah it's it's tough it is tough especially when baltimore knows that they're going to take care of the sideline right yeah and the one guy that is sort of that's his area of expertise is Keon Coleman. He's coming down to the bottom of the screen here. And he is that contested catch guy on the sideline, and if you're going to try one, that's probably the guy they try. Crater back in his younger days had a 64-yarder, third longest in league history. From the 47, Allen, no rushers. Throws, and they get it and get on the bounce at the 25 with Kinkade. The clock says zero. Allen looks at John Hussey, the referee, who says, hang on a second. Josh thinks there's a second left. The Ravens are gone. Hold on, please. Hold on. Hold on. John Hussey says he's gone. Rolling on the field. Hold on, Baltimore. Hold on, please. Baltimore, hold on. The rolling on the field is we're going to put one second on the game clock. Terry McCauley, our rules analyst, explain why. Sure. When his rear end hit out of bounds, we see on our clock one second. It had not gone to zero, so the officials on the field, they can get together and decide to put one second. They can also get assists from replay on that one to help them with that one second. And it is clearly one second when he's down, out of bounds. there was even a proposal this year it didn't get to a final decision for tenths of a second on the clock but you can see there was one on the frame when he went out of bounds unbelievable against a zero man rush they completed to the sideline here's Prater from 43 yards we have seen some terrific performances at the end of a half by teams in executing that and Buffalo just did a remarkable job to make this a one score game at the half Good stuff. 20-13. Baltimore gets it to start the second half. Pretty high energy. First half here in Orchard Park. Opened in 1973. The Bills move to a new $2 billion plus stadium. The other side of the parking lot here. Next year. Baltimore up 7. They get the ball. This kick going to the end zone. And a touchback. The Ravens will get it at the 35. Melissa, I'm going to go with John Harbaugh. John, you picked up right where you left off last season with the rushing attack. How do you continue to run the ball in the second half? Well, I think we're getting the premier plays. Lamar's doing a great job of getting us in the play we want, especially in this environment with this crowd. And I think the checks are making a difference, really. And we're blocking really well. And you held last season's MVP, Josh Allen, to just one touchdown. What's working? Well, we've got to do a great job of getting him in the pocket. He gets around. He extends plays. He made a couple throws on us that we'd like to have back. So that's the biggest thing. If we can keep him in there and make him throw from the pocket a little more. Thanks, John. Thanks, Mr. John Harbaugh is feeling really good about this team. We talked to him before the flight up here to Buffalo. And, Chris, we'll get into what he said maybe as the second half goes on of Lamar getting the team into premier plays. That's a little bit of an advancement in version 3.0, as they termed it, of this Ravens offense. 123-yard half for Derrick Henry. The second half begins with a run of three to the 38-yard line. And they're going to a base defense look here. Dorian Williams, the third linebacker, is coming in there. So we are likely going to see an effort to do what they did in the playoff game, which is to sell out, do anything that you can possibly do to stop Derrick Henry. Because if you don't stop him, then you can't stop Lamar from running it. Then you can't stop them from throwing it you have to come up with something and it looks like they're loading up to try and take away Henry Second seven bring an extra rusher here and Lamar trying to escape Oliver hit him and finished off After a game of about a yard. It was Matt Milano the veteran ends up making the tackle setting up third down He was picked off on the pass rush but athletic enough to get back in on it We'll see him right here come up and have to loop back But it was a huge tackle for this defense because they have a chance now third Nate They have a chance they desperately need to get off the field right here They go quick he'll bring late pressure Jackson throws to say flowers crossing flowers accelerates and almost gets out of the way. Rapp pulls him down at the 22-yard line. Quick snap. The late pressure never got there. They had Cole Bishop blitz from the farthest I've ever seen anybody blitz from, and he had absolutely no chance. The other safety comes running over the top, Taylor Rapp, and left nothing on the other side. I don't know if they mistimed that, But that was a ridiculous blitz. That one had no chance whatsoever and gave up the big play. The Ravens on the move again at the 23. Justice Hill in with Henry. The fake to Hill. The throw to Flowers. Who got a terrific block and lose score. What a block throw by Ronnie Stanley to freeze a Flowers and extend the Baltimore lead. The two best athletes on this offensive line Ronnie Stanley and Tyler Linderbaum both of whom had great first halves Watch these two guys go out and make these blocks They're basically tight ends playing on the offensive line and when they get in space they do not miss And Zay Flowers who became Baltimore's first pro bowler ever in the 29 years of the franchise as a wide receiver gets in the end zone for the first time this year. And a loop. That's the extra points. Buffalo goes through halftime in the adjustments. And the Ravens just get to the next level of their offense. Scoring on every drive. At time, it's Zay Flowers. 27-13. Lamar and the Ravens up. 29-28, there's one of their proud alums. Joe Andreessen, known in these parts as Buffalo Joe, made the team. I've been playing college football. Across the way at UB, University of Buffalo. That ball hits shy of the landing area, the target zone. So the Bills will get the ball at the 40-yard line. The first mistake of the night for the rookie kicker, Luke. Free kick, did not make it in the landing zone. The ball he plays at the 40-yard line, first down. That helps. We've seen that a couple of times this week. A lot of the kickers are trying to get those balls that land in the target area, but target zone, but are tough to field. So, Chris, what now if you're Buffalo offensively, as Baltimore just cannot be stopped when they have the ball? Well, I think that Josh has more time than he thinks. Maybe they came in here believing they couldn't get it protected. They've been very quick, but he may have to start holding on and working it down the field top. Goes Cook for a run with five yards. Mike Green, the rookie out of Marshall, taking the second round, comes up with a tackle for Baltimore. Yeah, looking forward to watching Mike Green play. Kyle Van Noy had 12 sacks for this team a season ago. Adafi Owe had 10. But there is something about this Mike Green. We spent more than a little time watching him in college. He can go, and they think that not only can he be a factor with the pass rush, and be a factor against the run, too. Second down. To Cook inside. Three yards to the 48-yard line. Green, some thought, would be first-round level talent, but dropped in the draft in part to some off-field concerns. It was an investigation into two separate sexual assault allegations in high school and then in college at Virginia. There were no charges filed in either case. The Ravens did their due diligence and decided to take him in the second round and from what everyone with Baltimore said they think he could be a Significant pass rushing factor for this team as the season goes on Right now we need a Russian factor from Josh Allen This is a huge moment in this game Gets the first down into Baltimore territory at the 47-yard line Teddy Buchanan, the rookie brings him down. It's a Buffalo first down with Allen. Great job by these offensive linemen setting inside and creating that lane. And I'm not sure it was a designated run, but those guys know. They've been around Josh and know. It's third and two. That sucker's going to take off, and he did again. And he is one of the best at it. Ball moves there. Got that second hand back on it. Last two MVPs, one and two in the voting, and showing you why again here tonight. The 47th, Cook slipping inside, and there's Cook with a first down gain of 11. Travis Jones retracing his steps, makes the tackle. First down, Buffalo. Take a look at Spencer Brown here, right here. Watch him take his man and almost get him airborne. completely moves them completely out of spot that's Tavius Robinson big strong physical guy and that's what it's going to take I mean they're going to have to balance this thing up a little bit with this running game and be as physical as what the Ravens are on the other side of the ball Spencer Bradshaw used to being bigger than the people who plays football against he did that but he was growing up in Lenox Iowa Allen first down from the 36 and incomplete Kyle Hamilton again it's always seemingly around the football yeah and he was just sitting on that one it was for Josh he sort of got away with one there right down the middle of the field and it looked like it was thrown to Hamilton when he threw it and if Kyle had broken up just a little bit he might have gotten that one But I do like the idea that what we're seeing Josh is beginning to realize he has more time than he thinks this line's doing a good job for Well Green Bay Packer Jair Alexander's 23 left side of your screen. He checks in at corner Limited game Chittabelle Wouzia makes the tackle so Wouzia Alexander a couple of the corners that they've added to this Baltimore defense to get ready for what they hope is a Super Bowl run Yeah, we haven't even really talked about Malachi starts the rookie starting at safety now For the Ravens and they said we kind of forget he's a rookie Sometimes that he knows everything our veteran guys know Very nicely in this secondary Could be fourth down, four down territory here. Third knee. Pressure coming. Allen gets rid of it. It's caught short of the first down by four yards. With Roquan Smith making the play on Elijah Moore. And they'll go for it. So fire zone here, drop out there. So basically going to force the quick throw right here. Got a free runner in there. It's the guy Josh Allen was talking about Kyle Hamilton coming in John Hussey hit to the head no flag fourth and five Spot last year Shakir stumbles Allen looks slinging end zone. It is flag on Palmer. Alexander covering Palmer, and it looks like pass interference of the new Raven, Jair Alexander. Pass interference, defense number 23. Ball, he places fun to foul. Automatic first down. Sometimes you just love veteran receivers. Here's the case right here. That ball was thrown up, no chance, and Josh Palmer just refused to be held up on the play and comes back and made it a no-brainer call for the officials. Veterans understand if you go back through the defender, you will get the call almost every time. 27-yard penalty on fourth and five. Gives Buffalo first and goal. And Allen looking for a spot to run. Turns it up. Rickon Smith brings him down at the two. A gain of two. You know, it's like a duel. Don't you feel like that? Like, I think both these guys are so hyper-competitive. And now we're starting to see Josh get some of that going in him as well. It is really just fun. This is good football. This is not like people are playing poorly and making mistakes. This is good football and two tremendous quarterbacks going at it From the two the Bills had a habit and they get it but finishes that's the battle right there that was the battle you got the huge guy Osiris Torrance Believe that was Nnamdi Matabike But that is the inside running ability of James Cook that I think took everybody by surprise a season ago And he's doing it again Point for Prater We have a penalty marker down on this one thrown by the two officials under the uprights. That usually means it's an extra man on defense. And Sean McDermott being given the option. Do you want to move it closer and go for two? And here's John Hussey. Defense at two minute on the field. Buffalo is elected to go for a two-point try from the one-yard line. And when you have a Josh Allen, it makes sense to try those things. And when you have a Lamar Jackson, it makes sense to try and get as many points as you possibly can. And, you know, that's what's fun about this matchup to me. It's people almost understand that The impossibility of completely stopping either one of these quarterbacks like it was a huge moment in that game on the last Ravens drive that third nine they didn't get it didn't get it stopped and now you pay the price So now here they come and cut this thing down to six. We see Philadelphia these situations go with the tush push in Buffalo It's affectionately known as the snow plow Among other names spread out here from the one And the penalty on the Ravens cost them a point and makes this a six-point game Hang on one second one second. We do have a flag back here in the end zone Did he step out of bounds because there's a hat down with one of the officials in the back? There you see. Anthony Fleming, field judge, through his cap. Let's see. As Coleman's working the back line, clearly out with contact from Nate Wiggins. And here's John Hussey. the receiver went out of bounds and was the first to touch the ball before he came back inbounds. Therefore, it is an incomplete pass. The try is no good. So, mistake and mistake on the try. And we dial back to 27-19 our score. Attaboy. Come on up big guy. He got the right gene. He got the humor gene. Oh my gosh. That was great. So 27-19 is the two points come off the board. Player out of bounds. It's the return of Baltimore and Ali, and he'll bring it to the 34-yard line, Chris. All right, let's take a look at our 4K Skycam brought to you by Walmart Plus. It should be Walmart Plus, Plus, Plus, Plus, because we have one of the great centers in the game, Tyler Lindebaum. Watch number 64 and what he does. This is like ballet if you're an offensive lineman. Stays in front on the tough blocks. Watch him leap through on this next one. It has just been so much fun to watch him play the center position. Hasn't given up a sack in the last two years. Their best run blocker. What an athlete playing sevens. Great stuff. Henry inside run for about a half dozen. Marking the 38-yard line. Officially a pickup of five halfway through this third quarter. Just back to that two-point conversion real quick. Terry McCauley, can I bring you in? That was a penalty, so why wasn't it a penalty and a retry for Buffalo? Because the foul, the penalty for a player going out of bounds and coming back from the first to touch is loss of down at the previous spot. So they don't get to repeat the down. They lost it. Got it. Awesome. Thank you, Terry. Appreciate it. He's the best. Three-time Super Bowl referee. Second and five. Henry in the backfield. They get to him. Ed Oliver, who has a sack, has a big tackle for loss, and puts Baltimore in third and long. Wow. That is two career-making plays right there Out of Ed Oliver. Just watch the contact here. And he's going to take Rosengarten right back into the middle of Derrick Henry. I'm just telling you, Mike, there's some good stuff going on for the first week of the season. Great game. These guys are playing. Third and ten. They go on the first sound again. Jackson going deep for Bateman. Incomplete. Bateman was entangled briefly with Christian Benford. No flag. and Baltimore's going to punch for the first time here tonight. Christian Benford has just done this since the beginning. When he came in at 22 as a six-round pick, nobody would have ever believed the impact that he would have at the cornerback position. And I tell you, on the other side tonight, Dorian Strong, we haven't mentioned his name, but for one penalty early on in this one. Jordan Stout's first kick of the season is a good one. 50 yards, Codrington contacted, able to still hang on, down at the 17. Buffalo bench saying that he was contacted before he could catch it on the tight coverage from Keon Martin. The undrafted rookie who was down there to make the play. Long field. It's going to be like this stadium's old style. It's kind of built in the ground. The field level is well below ground level but it has seen some moments it seems some great players over the years And that's one of them Josh Allen Buffalo Bills quarterback Me and Lamar Jackson giving us everything we thought we'd see here tonight Defense with a stop Buffalo takes over at their own 16 field to limit no gain on the play Billy is just a different forward today that he was when he got in the lead 16 resets escapes takes off the open field Marlon Humphrey down the 25 yard line with a penalty flag on the field this one's coming back holding offense number 79 10 yard penalty second down That's on Spencer Brown. Just couldn't quite get in front. Sometimes when you have help on the outside, it doesn't always help. And he's working against Kyle Vannoy, who put a good move on him. The old savvy veteran went off to the Pro Bowl last year. Congratulations. I think that was his first. It was. It was his fifth team in the league. He had 12 and a half sacks at 34 years old. Super Bowl rings. It's still so effective. And the hole pushes Buffalo back to second at 18. Before Alan climbing out of the end zone. Chased down by Van Der Bell. Little flip to Shakir. First down Buffalo. Oh, he's starting to feel it now. This is turning into one heck of a duel out here between these two quarterbacks But to escape up really had no chance to get his body in that perfect throwing position just flip it out over the top They get the first down as they go for their version of the tush push Meantime the blocking with Dalton Kincaid And Chittabay Wusie went way downfield The mark of the balls at the 27 yard line and now it's a Buffalo first down. That's what was going on Sean McDermott the old wrestler would have liked that move I mean, this is what it turns into with these two teams I mean it really does this these two teams Kansas City throw in Cincinnati a little bit Maybe we're going to throw in the Chargers now. I don't know but I mean they know this game means something because at the end of the year home field advantage whatever it's gonna mean something So you live this when you were with the Bengals you guys were on good teams Every week of course you're up But when you know the other team is one you respect and one you had to do everything to knock out of the playoffs a year ago You can't help but be at max effort going into a game like this. Well, I think the Pittsburgh Steelers will tell you this, too. When you play the Ravens, it's like a challenge to your manhood. It really is. Like, you cannot back down to these guys. You've got to go out and slug it out. And I'll say this. The Bills look like they could not figure out a way to stay in this game. But here they are. Second at eight. Allen unloads the sideline. Incomplete for Palmer. with coverage from Humphrey. It'll be third and eight. I'll tell you, throw out the name Marlon Humphrey, and boy, what a difference he makes for this football team. He can play outside. He had six interceptions last year for this team. He is the savvy veteran that, along with Kyle Hamilton, makes the calls, get them in the right position. Honestly, I don't know what they'd do without Kyle Hamilton and Marlon Humphrey on this team. They run the show. See what he did last year. I was talking to Marlon on the field before the game. He said, I'm that unk status guy. I'm the uncle here. Nine years in the league, but feels great. So excited for what this team can do. Again, Allen pressure. Gets away. Free space here. He's stopping to throw. Flinging Shakir again. Broken up. No flag. Fourth down. Hamilton again. Well, that was close. That was a great escape that time by Josh. Let's take a look at the tail end of this play The question is did he grab a shoulder and turn him Terry John T. Wester the rookie back to the Brad Robbins kick in Wester battles the wind and the twisty ball for the fair catch at the 32 yard line so both teams are stopped on back-to-back drives for the first time tonight 2 42 a good one here in the third And Kyle Hamilton is going to recognize almost immediately Shakir coming across the field and end up picking him up. A little contact down at the end. We've talked to our officiating friends. They say too much, just bang, bang, so that's a legal play. But here's the news. Kyle Hamilton goes in the locker room, and if there is a position that the Ravens are very thin at, That would be the one at safety so we'll keep an eye on what happens next. And the player you can't live without. As good as it gets back there. They check on Hamilton. Lamar Jackson first down. Jay Flowers having a big game. A lot of space. Flowers in the open field. All the way to the 32-yard line. Huge first down game for Flowers. It happens so many times you get in these little tight formations and they get confused as to whose man it is going across the formation and remember this when you're in your home stadium the crowd is very loud and it impacts your defense and probably no defense communicates more at the line of scrimmage than does the Buffalo Bills. I wonder if they just missed a call because of the crowd noise. Now a career high in receiving yards at the game from Flowers. Henry for about three. Noreen Williams the tackle. Here's Melissa. Yeah, Mike, I was watching Zay Flowers in the first half, and he was talking to Lamar Jackson on the sideline. He said the corners were grabbing him, that he just couldn't get open. Well, he's not talking about that in the second half after he scored that last Ravens touchdown. He went up and down the bench saying with a huge smile, I'm here this time, even yelling it to the crowd. Remember, he missed the divisional playoff game last season with that right knee injury. He's enjoying himself down here. Got a big hug from Harbaugh right there. Big embrace, lots of smiles. He's come back. Ten pounds. Strength of strength averages. Five-foot nine frame. He is having an opening night. Lamar laying it up for Hopkins. One hit! The finger has still got it! DeAndre Hopkins touchdown! Oh, wow. I'll say this. I have had a handshake with that hand right there. It is no surprise that that ball stuck. And if DeAndre Hopkins can do anything for this football team, that's it. Those contested throws, those balls on the sideline in the end zone, he could end up being the difference for this team come playoff time. DeAndre Hopkins, 33, still chasing that ring. Those big, huge hands. John Harbaugh telling us last night what he can be for. Renshaw, middle of the field, contorting his body. That his first target as a Baltimore Raven. I'd say 1-0 is 1-for-1. D. Hop grabs another one. His 84th career touchdown. Another beauty. DeAndre Hopkins, three-time first-team All-Pro. 179th NFL game. He's had a lot of quarterbacks. He's made a lot of good plays. But how about this one? Yeah, it looks like disadvantage for Hopkins. It was actually an advantage because as all that contact was taking place, He knew he was going to catch it with one hand. Kickoff, line drive. Codrington with the return. Sideline, Brandon's right at the 35-yard line. We have a penalty marker thrown where he was trying to break through. Kyle Hamilton went into the locker room, coming back out. Looking at that left hand with another glove. John Hussey will tell us what the foul was. during the return holding receiving team number 42 that 10 yard penalty will be enforced from the spot of the foul first down one more time the touchdown and they go to celebrate and over by the fence fan hits him up on the head and then hits Lamar Jackson and after that fan It wasn't celebrating at all. Hit him. Jackson pushes the fan back. Obviously, both in the wrong there. But you can't be pushing the players if you're a fan there as well. It wasn't as though Hopkins was doing anything that he was extending himself into the crowd. And I think Lamar saw the first one and then took one himself. And I'm not excusing. I know there's no way you're allowed to go after fans in the stand almost no matter what happens, but sometimes that gets a little ridiculous too Second at six for Buffalo now down 50 Allen's protected It will be a first down with Wiggins covering Joshua Palmer. But the Bills will move the chains as this third quarter comes to an end. 14 points for the Ravens, including the highlight touchdown for Hopkins. Six points for the Bills. Ravens 34, Bills 19 as we head to the fourth quarter here in Orchard Park. You're watching NFL Kickoff Weekend, presented by YouTube TV. NFL kickoff weekend presented by The Bills were so good last year. Didn't lose. They're down 15 with 15 to go. First down, Allen. Sideline. Keon Coleman brings it in. That's another Buffalo first down. They're going to have to make up for this deficit in a hurry. Came down to that one high look which means one-on-one on the outside and of the tape I watched during the summer about this team. He throws it to Keon Coleman when that happens almost every time Kyle Hamilton comes back in and that break between the third and the fourth quarter with some padding on that left hand He's been checked out. He's been playing great. Kyle Hamilton's just had a fight. Fourth year, got a big contract. Highest paid safety league history. Burning it again. Pressure right here. Allen goes to Coleman, who has not turned around. It's incomplete. Melissa? Yeah, Mike, so we saw Kyle Hamilton leave the field. He went immediately into the x-ray room where he spent five minutes. And then when he came back out, you see him there. He was with the athletic training staff. You mentioned the padding at the base of his pointer finger. Then they put his glove back on and taped his middle finger to his pointer finger. And we'll keep an eye on it. All right. You see the tape job there. The athletic training staff. And great job by our crew. And after a long weekend, a game in Philly Thursday with the weather delay up here on Sunday. Best in the business. Back at work. I'm going to be with all of you guys. Off in time, here comes the blitz, get rid of it to Cook. If he can get past that, he's got space. And there he goes. Cook, 20, 15, 10, what a run. Cook, down at the one yard line. Sensational play to keep the touchdown from happening by Nate Wiggins. What a 52-yard game. That was all Josh Allen on that one. You heard the Lester call, which means he's going to slide the line that way. They still brought pressure away from him, so he had to throw it hot. And now you've got James Cook over there making it happen. Allen trying to run left for the touchdown. Gets thrown down aggressively by Malachi Starks, the rookie. When they get in close, Chris, you've pointed this out the last couple of years. Bills love to go to the left. Baltimore was loading up for that one. And now we have a whistle stopping play here for an injured Raven. And that is Marlon Humphrey in the end zone. Wonder if it happened on the play before. So, this audible is just so good. But he's going to go Lester, Lester, Lester, right? So we're going to go that way. And if they come from the other way as well, then he's got to throw that thing hot. They do. Van Noy comes off the edge. There's nobody left. Roquan Smith had to try to make the play and catch up because ultimately that was his responsibility. But that play and what we've seen from Lamar tonight as well, in the first week of the season, these guys are all over what defenses are trying to do to them, and they're making the adjustments to make them pay. And don't lose the back end of the play where Nate Wiggins comes all the way over across the field, gets off a block, makes the tackle of Cook, and then a loss of a yard on that rushing attempt by Allen. So it's second and goal from the two. Big bodies including the fullback, Reggie Gilliam. It's a fake. Allen looks to the back of the end zone. He'll take it himself. For the touchdown. Down nine. They're going for two. I hope everybody's enjoying this as much as I am. I mean, all the way down, every detail covered, when you see Josh Allen with that play fake, watch his head when he does that. It looks like he made the handoff and he's just staring at the running back going through there That sold the final person that had to be sold me walks in the end zone Going for two Coleman was covered Allen now ad-libbing as always. Intercepted by Hamilton. He can take it back the other way. Dangerously pitches it back to Van Noy, who will take a knee. Just because you have the interception doesn't mean the Bills can't score points. Could have the odd one point there for Buffalo. That was almost a safety. With Van Noy taking a knee. In any case, nine-point game. Stays around the area and is here on hand tonight So it's a two possession game bills go for two we've seen teams do that often Going for two the first time around especially with this much time on the clock Just so you know what you need to do the rest of the game Ali with a return and he's got a seam and he takes it across the 35 to the 36-yard line. Chris, let's go back to that two-point play and almost a boneheaded play. Yeah, let's bring in Terry because once he lateraled the ball back into the end zone, if he had taken a knee or just got tackled, that is a safety at one point, right, Terry? Absolutely, Chris. Once the entire ball gets out of the end zone, it's now on him. He puts it back in with the backward pass. Luckily, Van Nooy came into the field of play and went down on one knee rather than doing it in the end zone. The veteran figured it out. You haven't had a play like that in NFL history, but anybody can recall where it would be one point because the possession was on the defense and then back in the end zone. In any case, the pass incomplete intended for Zay Flowers. And, Chris, you mentioned a few times Zay Flowers not being in the playoff game. Just in that third quarter, 39-23 and 36-yard completions, Jackson to Flowers. Well, and the reason it was so significant is because the Buffalo Bills did a great job with their man coverage and taking that extra guy to take away Derrick Henry. And that was the reason his not being there, because he is the man-to-man specialist. He would have been a very difficult cover for this Bulls team. Huge first half for Henry. Held a check in the rushing in the second half. That ball ruled a catch for Hill. And nine yards, one shot. The first down to the 44-yard line. Naquan Jones helping to go back and make the stop. The other thing I remember about that playoff game is Justice Hill. That was down. That was down. We'll see if replay assists will take care of that. And they will. After assistance from replay, the rolling on the field is an incomplete pass. I love replay assists. 1237 degrees. 1237. Clear and obvious. So replay assist does it. Don't have to challenge. And now the challenge in the Bills fans for third attempt. Leap it a spy on Jackson who's in trouble gets away escaping got a lot of room there he goes first down the bar much more across midfield to the 46 yard line takes a half heavy hit but 19 yards. I mean I honestly don't know what to do with this guy. That is a sack for every quarterback almost that's ever played that position and not only is it not a sack it turns into one of the most spectacular plays of the weekend. He does it all the time though. I mean you want to know why these two guys are the 1-2 in the MVP voting? There you go. Dean in 19, probably right about 60 on that play. And here goes Henry. Right in the second half. Not anymore. Henry, another touchdown. He only had six yards in the second half after the huge first half. But now he's got 175 on the night and two touchdowns. Here's the problem. Taylor wraps about a 4-7 guy when he's running and Derrick Henry is faster bigger And he just simply pulls away from the Buffalo Bill safety That was part of the reason they tried to get Cole Bishop in to add a little element of speed But the play by Lamar Jackson was the back break It just took all the spirit out of the Bills defense First point of the season. That one no good for Luke. Won't be the last. It will not be. It keeps it a 15-point game. On the night up to 175 yards. So that is game 7 over 150 past age 30. And that's Derrick Henry and Walter Payton. That's it. Sweetness in the hall and King Henry will be there too. joining a lot of football greatness with some health and continued success this year. Brandon Coggington's return shy of the 30-yard line at the 28. Buffalo will take over there, down 15 with 11.35 to go. You know, and this isn't rare what Baltimore is doing. They had 29 run plays of 20-plus yards a season ago, and we just had back-to-back. I mean, they were backed up in their own zone, right? Yes. And the Morrow's running the wrong way. All of a sudden, he's out at the 50, and then, you know, Derek did the rest. And that is out of those two numbers you just saw there. That's out of 42 total plays. The Ravens are averaging almost 10 yards per play here tonight. Allen's got to go to work here with the Bills. Doing it on the sideline with Keon Coleman. Gets up very close to the first down, just shy of it, at the 37-yard line. Baltimore the first to serve up a 40-burger this year, scoring 40 points, but Chrissy, in the last year, their last four regular season games was 35, 34, 31, 35. They're just picking up where they left off. I mean, it is, it's match with Boston's two offenses. The hard part is I've seen both coordinators with the Rolodex out and just spinning up defenses and trying everything possible. Sometimes the other guys are just better. 43 The field interception let's check it replay though Automatically reviewed as it was called an INT on the field When he's laying on top of the ball there. After the review, the rolling on the field is an incomplete pass. It's just too much of the ball. Even though Terry, it's in contact with his body, he doesn't have control of it when it's against the ground, does he? No, Mike. He never got control before the ball hit the ground. Absolutely incomplete. Good play. Chris, that could be a big part and pickup of this defense this year with the veteran Owousia. I mean, if those two guys stay healthy, Jair Alexander and Owousia stay healthy and can play all the way through the season, absolutely. Nate Wiggins and Marlon Humphrey on the quarters as well. So in completion, second and ten. Allen escaping. He's got some room to run here. And Josh Allen slides down. The mark of the slide actually has him short of the first down. He knows it too. so be third one inside game rate Davis has the bounce of the flags down and Allen by sliding early didn't pick up the first down and now Buffalo's gonna be backed up to third and long Let's go back and look at the slide. It is where the ball is when the slide begins. Nope, let's look at that. He's going forward actually here on this. Let's see. Terry, that body part comes down right at the line, doesn't it? Exactly. It's the front of the football when the body part touches the ground, and it's clearly beyond the line right there. It's clearly been on the line. This should have been a first down. Missed the spot by about a yard on the field. Should have been challenged. Sorry, Terry. We had another flag thrown down here after the penalty was being walked off. Holding. Offense number 73. Ten-yard penalty from the previous spot. Third down. Okay, they were just moving the flag back to where the penalty occurred. So Deion Dawkins calls for the hole to take it back to third down. Terry, how tough is that play for the officials to spot the ball as it's going 10 yards downfield after the Allen run? It is difficult, Mike. He's following the play, but they've done this for years. They should be able to get a little bit better than a yard away from it. So now it's third and 11. And Allen in trouble, and he goes down. and is sacked for the first time. Namde Matadike, who had 8.5 last year, 6.5 I should say, gets his first of this year, and the Bills will punt. Yeah, he had 13 sacks back in 23 and really was a big sensation in the league. And you can see that kind of movement, skill, and strength to go along with it. When those defensive tackles come from inside out, Bang into the tackle and bounce right to the quarterback very difficult stop Yelling everybody get away on that short punch by Robbins Buffalo will take over at or Baltimore should take over at the 35 Buffalo gets nothing out of a drive They had to have it And they down 15 Before, we saw the week four Derrick Henry dominance against the Bills and a similar act, even more explosive runs in this one. 14 carries 175 yards. It's insane. three 30-plus yard runs in this game for the first time in his terrific career adding to it here he's built for it that's true I can remember the issue of Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry almost not here stop for a loss to state Juan Jones is there to bring up third and long we asked him yesterday about his Workouts anything changing now that you're 31 years old is enough didn't change No reason to said if anything I added more of the hills Nutrition standpoint there's an intermittent fasting that he does along the way whatever he's doing Shame on us for not following we're gonna start it next week, and I'm sure yeah, okay. What time Jim in Minnesota? And they'll kill the play. It'll be third and 13. I mean, it's almost, though. Full start. Offense number 16. Five-yard penalty. Third down. I just wonder how many teams in the AFC are sitting at home watching this game going, uh-oh. You know, I mean, seriously, this is a pretty dominant performance against one of the top teams in the league. in their place, and you could just feel the frustration of the Ravens when we were talking to them about this playoff game a season ago. You know, it was just, they ate at them for the entire offseason. And they're paying it back now. Third and 13, another flag down. And Zane Flowers is down shot. First down, let's check the marker on the far side. Six penalties Baltimore four on Buffalo. One area the Ravens need to cut down on. Little motion. Offense number four. That penalty is declined. Fourth down. So it's on Flowers. Yeah, they let you get away with a little bit, Not a lot of it. You're going to see Flowers turn up towards the line of scrimmage. Get a little jump on the route. Clearly a foul. So the Bills do get the ball back with half the quarter left at a two-score game. So still alive, but obviously needs some special stuff to happen. A good number of folks have left here at Highmark Stadium. Steve branding codrington can give the bills good field position as Jordan stout kick it here for the second time Ravens down it is the one Simpson, no, a touchback. He did get to the line. If you try to down the ball and slide into the line, that is a touchback. His number 32 slid into the end zone and touched the white line. Therefore, it's a touchback. It's a really poor play. I mean, at that point, you just have to knock it back off the line. And when you allow yourself to slide into the end zone, any part of your body or that ball touches the line, that's it. And just one glove, one finger, one glove getting there. And you just don't anticipate how far you're going to slide when you try to dive on that ball, but you've just got to tap it back. So, plus 19 yards for the Bills, and they started at 20. It makes the kids great job going up to get a game 21 That was one of those perfect throwing motions right there And that is what they can do on the outside for Josh Allen key on Coleman that is his play right there Allen trying to get out of there escapes Aces the fake at the pump to get a whole bunch of yards on the ground and get close to another first down. Mark about the 47-yard line. Let's go back and watch Josh Allen throwing to his left to Keon Coleman. This was a throw he really struggled with when he was coming out of college. Anything off to his left, he trained a long time to really open up his hips and get better at that. But the continued improvement of what he has done with his fundamentals of throwing the ball. He was not that accurate a guy when he was in college. Throw in the middle here. Joshua Palmer. That's a three-yard line. And a first down for Buffalo. 6.05 to go. Down 15. And all three timeouts. So still alive here if they can get it in the end zone. 2-0. 2-0. All right, Andy. Let's check. I mean they finally the best part about that incomplete pass it allowed those exhausted defensive linemen to get off the field I mean they were barely able to create a push and in part because that they were able to get their hands up and knock one down but as soon as that ball was knocked down they all turned and ran for the sideline. Full-fledged line change. And the Sabre season doesn't start for about a month. They were coming over the boards. Second attempt. Allen protected inside the throat. Seven-yard line with Keon Coleman. So that's catch number five tonight for the second year, man. The 29 all of last season. Still plenty of time here, and they just have to make a play. They need to score something right here and make one defensive stop before this game's over. But that has seemed to be almost impossible. Whoa, left. You got zero. Nothing. Nothing. I got you. I got you. I got you. It was on it. I learned it. I learned it. Zero, zero, zero. Come here. On the hazard. After all that, Allen's in the sideline incomplete for the flag. Right back to Coleman in front of Nate Wiggins. That 6'3 frame of Coleman factor on this drive. Pass interference. Defense number two. Ball, he placed the spot of the foul. Automatic first down. And Nate Wiggins runs a 4-2-8. He does not have to worry about Coleman going by him, which is why you're seeing him almost in a fist fight with every step of the way going down the field. He's not worried about the deep ball. He's worried about that one thrown behind him, that back shoulder. Right here, son. Alert it. Alert it. Run out, run out, run out. Right here. What's that? 29-yard line. Final coming. Harrison Kincaid. he's got a first down inside the 20. Plot stopped at 4.59. It's just a different offense it really is when Dalton Kincaid's in the lineup and healthy it was it was a little hard to watch this offense without him he could play but he wasn't the same guy that he was for the most part early in his career and early in that season. To the red zone bills it scored the prior four times For Palmer Step away I think every quarterback and every receiver will agree the hardest thing that they do Is the hesitate and go and trying to time that throw up because it's It's different, you know Everybody's used to flying off the ball and getting down the field But when you're in the red zone to go hesitate and go it's like an opportunity to throw a go around right When you don't have the space for it, it's just the timing of it is so hard And Ty Johnson with Teddy Buchanan that rookie the fourth-round pick out of Cal in coverage And you cannot throw a football better than that. It is absolutely perfect pretty good coverage to his best receiving back coming out of the backfield, and Ty Johnson's going to catch that almost every time. That is a huge miss. We'll bring up third and ten, obviously, given the scoreboard situation, four down territory for Buffalo. Run out, run out, run out. We're good, we're good, we're good. All right, Andy, we're good. Aben bringing fourth. Underneath, Palmer spinning. Very close to the first down. Keep the clock moving. Rule him. See, two yards shy. Fourth and long one, short two. I think you're going to see a spread out formation. And depending on what they do on the back end coverage, you'll either see Josh run the football here. Or if they're just one on one, he'll pick and choose who he likes. clock down to 4-12 the Bills got to have this fourth and two got to spread out two Raiders pursuing and Allen throws deflected and caught by Colvin on the tip 4-6 and the Bills remain alive I've never seen a football game like this before. Not week one. I mean, you feel like you're in an arcade or something or playing Madden. I don't even know how to describe this stuff. Balls getting tipped and flying around. Quarterbacks running around like crazy people. Nobody can catch them. Derrick Henry running up and down the field. And so this time down nine, Buffalo will go for one and try to make it a one-score game with three timeouts trying to do what's been really hard, stop the Ravens. Prater gets the extra point, and we have a one-score game here in Orchard Park. The Bills had to have Keon Coleman come up with a big year. He is the guy they drafted a season ago. He's just going to keep competing here. Gets to the back line, stays focused on it. The ball's tipped around, and he makes a diving catch. and Sean McDermott is telling us about Coleman when we visited with him on Friday. Maybe the guy who's grown the most on the team, he really had a plan when he left here. He was not up here during the offseason, but they kept getting videos of the work he was doing, and when he got here once the minicamp started, he came back with ability, maturity, and he comes up with a touchdown here to make it a one-possession game. I wonder if John Harbaugh is sitting over there going, what do we have to do to put these guys away? I'm so impressed with the Buffalo Bills. It just has never felt like they were really in the game, and yet they're hanging around, and it's an eight-point game right now. Anything can happen over here. Ali and Hildebik kicking to Ali most of the night. Takes it from the four. Runs into a wall. Brought down Shy. The 30-yard line by Dorian Williams. The guys on the top of the marquee have been as advertised. Better. Better? Better. All right, go ahead. You got it. I mean, you know, you take either one of these guys off of these two teams. And, I mean, basically, they've changed the face of the game. This is not a drop-back, throw-from-the-pocket league anymore with these two guys leading the way. And Lamar's going to take it in his own hands and slide inbounds to keep that clock turning and immediately get a first down of the 41-yard line. I mean, I want you to watch the edge player here. How many different things are presented in front of him? I mean, it simply is one guy is unblocked, and he has people going in three different directions, and there's just no way that you can keep up with what that is. Zaire Mitchell-Payden, first-year player, I should say, He's a man protecting, and Henry lost the football. And the Bills are down there. And they have it. He's having an unbelievable night, but stopped behind the line. The ball punched out, and Terrell Bernard comes up with it. Yes, Ed Oliver again going to end up making the play here, punching that thing out, and now 25,000 Bills fans are trying to get back in the stadium. He's had some kind of night, Oliver. Oh, my goodness. There are so many guys who've had a great night tonight. That Oliver's made the Pro Bowl tonight. So the Bills will take over at the 30-yard line. They've already scored 13 points in this fourth quarter. And a chance with a touch and a two to tie the game. Allen taking a shot downfield. It's hauled in. Kicked and run out the third tight end. Jackson Hawes. The rookie out of Georgia Tech. His first ever catch. Brings it to the one. Bills get right on the ball. Allen. This time tries to go right. He's furry and is stopped. Jackson Hawes, fifth round pick out of Georgia Tech. First five years he was at Yale. He's the blocker. He's the blocker in this offense. and makes the play on a second bounce. Mike, this game is nuts. This thing goes to overtime. It'll be one of the all-time all-timers. Closing in on the two-minute warning. Second and goal. Gav, Cook, left side, fighting for the goal line. Ruled short. We're short and we've got the two-minute warning. Oh, my goodness. So it will be third and goal from about a foot away. Remember, Buffalo needs a two-point conversion along with a touchdown to tie the game. After the game's first turnover in stunning fashion. I mean, the Buffalo Bills, we talked about the Detroit Lions. We've talked about grit. We're talking about hard-nosed football players. The fact that the Bills have just hung in there in this game, right, is all you can do. I mean, everything that Lamar and Derek was doing on the offensive side, there was no reason to believe. And then you hang in long enough, you get that one break finally, and here you are on the doorstep of tying this thing up. And you've got a bunch of what-ifs. The Bills took a point off the board, went for two, and Keon Coleman had a foot out of bounds and was the first to touch. They lost that. Tyler Loop doinked an extra point off the upright. So we've had both ways points that you thought were going to happen, not happen. So we sit on eight points here at the two-minute warning. Buffalo, a couple of shots to get a touchdown. Allen reaches over the pylon or the goal line for the touchdown. Broke the plane just by jumping and using that 6'5 frame. And now they go for two to try to tie this game. Everybody does the same thing on these quarterback sneaks. They try to submarine underneath, and that time Josh Allen right over the top. That's a pretty cool wrinkle to that, right? Everybody going down there. They've got some play that they have practiced almost every day in training camp, and we're about to see it. The most important play, the most practiced play that the Bills have in their R-Z. Here it is. The throw to Coleman is broken up by Nate Wiggins. Game certainly not over. Three timeouts, minute 58, multiple options on what Buffalo wants to do. But Wiggins keeps them from tying it. Remember we were talking about the battle they had down the field? Look at that. It wasn't even started, and Wiggins is looking back in the backfield. He knew the ball was coming. Those one-on-one opportunities, and he was there to make a huge play. It's not over. This is plenty of time, plenty of timeouts. And you were talking about the play you want to get to. Do you like getting to that play? I wasn't crazy about where it was thrown. I know it was a bit of a back shoulder, but you've got a big size advantage right there for Keon Coleman. And, you know, it was sort of thrown body high. Buffalo 0-3 on two-point conversions. They only tried one last year and converted it at three in this first game. Now they choose not to go for the declared onside kick here. They're going to kick it off with three timeouts. Absolutely. 1.58 to go. I think Derrick Henry is going to get a chance to make a bet. Justice Hill and Oli wait. He'll be returned again. It's Oli from the sixth. Big hit. Bounces off and stays alive. Good tough running for Gino Lee to keep this going at the 31-yard line where Baltimore will take over with 151 in all three Buffalo timeouts. Well, you know for the Buffalo Bills what they're going to do now, they're going to have to stack the line of scrimmage and take away the run and just hope somebody can make a play if, in fact, they throw the football. If they stop them with three downs, Bills can still get the ball back with about a minute 27 or so left. Crowd in the line. Henry's got it. Russo over there. You see McDermott streaking toward the official. Get the timeout at 1.45. So these multiple conversions as you go through the night, play the game out. Here they are. These all two-point tries. Yeah, I think this was Keon Coleman stepping out of the back of the end zone. That did not count. Loss of down. Wiggins again there to make that play. And then again, Allen on the move. Throws it to Kyle Hamilton who almost threw it back for one point for Buffalo because he threw it back to a teammate. And then the last one a moment ago with Coleman. Now we're up second and nine coming up. And there may be folks who left, but those who are here are being heard. Hill is there in the backfield. It's Flowers to the edge. He goes down, knowing not to go out of bounds. Matt Milano is there. Timeout Buffalo, 139 to go. Wow, they're going to have a chance. They are one play away from getting the ball back and only needing a field goal to win this football game. With a guy who just got here Thursday is Matt Prater. Crazy. This would be one of the gutsiest comebacks I think I've ever seen. Honestly. I mean, for this team, they've got to be exhausted. They've been chasing these guys up and down the field. And now here they are, one play. They need one play. The ball leaves the hands of Lamar Jackson. I think you've got to throw the ball and try to win this thing right now. Lamar Jackson has to have it in his hands, but whether he throws it or runs it. Play clock running down. Jackson with direct communication to DeAndre Hopkins. They need to get to the 41. Flowers in motion, the Bills bring a blitz And the throw is caught But stuck out of the first down On the tackle by Christian Medford Hopkins is down to the 38 And Buffalo will get the ball back Unless they decide to go for it I'm going to say You've got choices to make everywhere here Your defense hasn't exactly been stopping the Buffalo Bills either. But they're in field goal range if they get stopped here, right? I got you. But you also have three timeouts on your side, too. You do. You get the ball back. Yeah. It is fourth and three, and it is Brandon Codrington going back. Jordan Stout to kick it. Play the fake first. I'm feeling these kicks and scouts done a nice job to keep it out of his hands. The Bills will get a ball back around the 20. The whistles you hear, there's just two gunners going after each other here and blocking, but that is all cleaned up. No fouls. Here comes Josh Allen. But first, a reminder, Chevrolet postgame ahead. Melissa with the stars of the game. We'll look at it next Sunday night in Minnesota. Coming up right after the game. So, for a stadium that is seeing its 53rd and final season and has seen a lot of magical moments, this one would be right up there with any other. The Bills look down and out on this opening night. They were down 15 a short time ago, have rallied, and now a field goal would win it. All right, we're good. Josh Allen starts from the 20. Underneath, brought in for six. Michael, Shakir, Buffalo, no timeouts. Matt Prater in this direction, warming up, made a 53-yarder, so thinking about getting it another 40 yards. Allen swinging sideline brought in by Coleman. Seventh catch of the night for Keon Coleman. First down Buffalo with a minute to go. Talking about looking like an MVP right now, Josh Allen looks in complete control. Just short drive starting completions to get this thing going. Plenty of time for him. Allen gets away from the rush. He's got some space. He's going to take off and Get out of bounds. Right around the 38. Roquan Smith was there hoping to hit him before he got to the sideline. That used seven seconds. And it's a good thing that Josh Allen's as big as he is because he continued forward on the play and didn't get knocked backwards, which would have ended up stopping the clock. Receivers are Palmer, Shakir, and Coleman. Go to zero, go to zero. Go to zero. Go to zero. Go to zero. Go to zero. Hey, go prison. Go prison. I've got movement there. No running clout, so no 10-second runoff. Mike, what happened that time? Let the call be made. False start. Offense number 73. Five-yard penalty. Second down. They were up there at the line of scrimmage and making the call, and there was silence. And then Josh saw something and got excited. And he said, goal center, good. And his offensive lineman that time, Deion Dawkins, ends up jumping because of the excited nature of the way that Josh Allen made that call. So you lose five. It's back to second and 10. Right now, right now. Alert it, alert it. Come on, come on. Come on. Very good. Round one. Over her. Is it? Dawson knocks in motion. Allen unloading. Throwing. That's Palmer. Out of bounds at the 35. Third field goal range. Remarkable. Just absolutely zipped that throw in there. That was from the first quarter when he came out with that almost angry look. There's only a handful of quarterbacks in this league that could have made that throw right there. And now Baltimore has to start thinking about what they're going to do with their timeouts They get it back to try to respond if Buffalo can score Bring some pressure Timeout Ravens I tell you, that may not be all bad. Exactly. Because if he had scored on that play, it would have given Baltimore and Lamar Jackson an opportunity to get the ball back. Now you're going to get into all those discussions. Now, I got you. We've got Matt Prater, another kicker, who's not their ordinary kicker. But this isn't much of a kick at this point. do we even see the possibility of letting them score from here? And I guarantee the Buffalo Bills are over there saying, even if they do that, take a knee on the one-yard line. Don't tell them hard to shake your head, because we're all doing the same. Of course, the Bills have had remarkable comebacks in this stadium. You think back to the playoffs and Frank Reich, but the last win trailing by 15 in the fourth quarter goes all the way back. to a wild one against the Jets. So first and goal, two timeouts for Baltimore. And the Bills strategy will be interesting to watch. Do they try to score, and then does Baltimore let them? I mean, I assume they're setting up for a kick at this point. Do you want to, at the very least, get rid of those timeouts? I think they take it down as far as you can. Yeah, absolutely. Allen takes it easy. Baltimore takes a timeout. They can take another one. In, let's say, three seconds, but then they become powerless to stop the clock after that. And then, Melissa, it would turn to the veteran, Matt Prater. Yes, I talked to him right before the game during warm-ups. He, as you mentioned, took the red eye to Buffalo from Arizona on Thursday night. He told me he finally feels like himself today after catching up on sleep. We talked about if he knows any of his teammates' names yet. He said, I'm learning. And I asked how he feels kicking here. He said since he's played here several times, he is very comfortable. He has played three games here in his career. So hard to feel comfortable in this stadium. But he did kick it here week one last year against Arizona. But this is now short stuff for a guy who's attempted 487 NFL field goals coming into tonight. And add two more to that here this evening. They've been working on Spencer Brown in these timeouts. The big right tackle has been cramping, getting a lot of fluid in there as the Bills are about to run. The 77th play of the night. And it's victory formation. Harbaugh takes a final timeout. And I remember Buffalo has no timeouts. So they have to have the strategy to get their guys out there quickly if they take a knee here and be set, not for a fire drill field goal, but the closest thing to it. I don't know what to say. Of course, a two-score game when it was 40-25. Teams in it. You're one play away, and we saw the fumble happen. But even at home, it just felt like the Bills lost their energy. Would you have Josh scramble around and throw it away? But then when he throws it away, you're going to leave Baltimore 25 seconds, right? No matter how long he scrambles. Yeah, so you're just going to run the field goal team out there, yeah. Whichever he practices, but they haven't done it with Prater. So he takes a name. Now they go out there. And Matt Prater will come on for a game-winning field goal. 41-year-old who's been to the Pro Bowl a few times. He's made long ones. He's made game winners. Less than 100 hours in western New York. As the clock runs down, Prater lines up for a game. Winning field goal. From 32 yards, Freighton made it! And the Bills open their final season in this stadium with a stunning comeback win.
