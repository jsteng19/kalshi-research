[ct=0.454] [music playing]
[ct=1.390] FedEx Field.
[ct=2.641] First of all, the ways to watch.
[ct=3.990] We can tell you other ways to watch Prime Vision with Next
[ct=7.982] That broadcast on Spanish with TNF En Espanol.
[ct=11.918] Everybody's always talking about a coach on the hot seat.
[ct=14.559] You lose 14 in a row, obviously the seat is very hot.
[ct=18.554] Matt Eberflus second year, mark of 3 and 18,
[ct=23.872] trying to get into the wind column tonight.
[ct=26.551] His counterpart, Ron Rivera.
[ct=30.541] He's coaching in his fourth season
[ct=33.146] here, formerly at Carolina.
[ct=35.881] And, of course, he played for the Chicago Bears
[ct=38.930] and was part of the great Bears teams in the mid '80s.
[ct=46.940] Two quarterbacks, of course, you've
[ct=48.238] got Justin Fields, who was a first rounder,
[ct=50.938] in his third season, and this could be a season
[ct=54.917] to determine very much what his future will be as he comes
[ct=58.877] to midfield for the coin toss.
[ct=61.574] Sam Howell, a fifth round pick.
[ct=64.173] Normally, a fifth round pick is not
[ct=65.532] a guy you think is going to be a franchise quarterback.
[ct=69.502] You can only hope.
[ct=70.879] Ron Rivera after his only start a year ago as a rookie
[ct=73.487] that last game against Dallas came out in January
[ct=77.480] and said this is our guy.
[ct=78.772] We're moving forward into next year.
[ct=80.119] I a lot of people thought they may potentially
[ct=82.747] draft another quarterback.
[ct=84.103] Instead, they went with Sam Howell.
[ct=86.735] Now four games in, he showed some signs of--
[ct=90.747] Commanders fans being very excited
[ct=92.108] about his potential in this new scheme,
[ct=94.741] and we'll see how he gets off tonight out to a good start.
[ct=98.710] They had Carson Wentz.
[ct=100.057] Taylor Heinicke did a decent job.
[ct=102.701] He's gone.
[ct=104.129] So then this season, it was a matter
[ct=105.714] of whether Jacoby Brissett, who they picked up,
[ct=109.381] or Howell win the job in mid-August.
[ct=112.010] The job belongs to Howell.
[ct=114.661] Boy, he has demonstrated a lot of poise
[ct=115.973] here in his last couple of weeks.
[ct=118.643] Buffalo got after him for 9 sacks.
[ct=121.329] He bounced back against Philly and showed a lot of poise
[ct=123.965] in a loss, a close loss to the Eagles on the road.
[ct=127.985] Nice night just outside the District of Columbia.
[ct=130.592] Temperature is 70 degrees, light breeze.
[ct=135.912] Joey Slye to kick off.
[ct=137.301] Velus Jones back to receive at FedEx Field, home
[ct=143.875] of this franchise since 1997.
[ct=147.885] [cheering]
[ct=149.151] Week 5 is underway with a touchback.
[ct=154.495] So Fields coming off his best performance of his career
[ct=158.480] last week, certainly in the first half,
[ct=161.160] and then the second half a whole other story
[ct=163.818] with a very costly fumble, an interception.
[ct=166.469] But overall, there were the numbers, 4 TDs, the pick,
[ct=170.470] only 25 rushing yards for a guy who's been in triple figures
[ct=175.780] Last year, over 1,000 yards rushing.
[ct=177.070] And you know what we saw last week is
[ct=179.788] he made quick decisions.
[ct=181.057] They got him out on the edge.
[ct=182.389] They threatened with his legs and he
[ct=183.744] was able to complete his first 16 passes.
[ct=186.379] They got him in rhythm early.
[ct=187.734] Likes to line up as is the case here in the pistol.
[ct=190.374] The fake to Herbert.
[ct=191.694] Retreats, has time, goes deep, and off the hands of Darnell
[ct=198.363] Mooney, who'd beaten his man.
[ct=199.718] So Mooney got out in front.
[ct=200.965] Just couldn't handle it, and it'll be second down and 10.
[ct=204.978] Well, this offensive line, obviously like most,
[ct=207.636] performed better when they have a chance
[ct=210.293] to be first and 10 play action.
[ct=211.576] You see you get one on one opportunity, a clean pocket,
[ct=214.286] takes a shot, and just can't quite
[ct=216.917] hit his number one target a year ago, Darnell Mooney.
[ct=220.903] But this is what they're looking for, Luke Getsy.
[ct=222.266] Love the call here, taking that shot.
[ct=224.915] He had him one on one and he got behind coverage.
[ct=228.916] Beat Kendall Fuller.
[ct=231.552] Keep it on the ground.
[ct=232.866] Herbert goes nowhere.
[ct=234.201] Montez Sweat making the tackle there.
[ct=239.483] So another guy under the gun has been Luke Getsy, the Bears
[ct=244.822] offensive coordinator.
[ct=246.183] He, again, trying to in a way revamp what Fields does
[ct=250.151] and what the offense does.
[ct=252.787] Just trying to find that rhythm, keeping in mind
[ct=254.128] they've got a rookie right tackle and their two starters
[ct=256.772] on the left side over these last couple of weeks,
[ct=258.124] left guard and left tackle not playing.
[ct=260.785] So it's made it tougher to get Fields into that rhythm.
[ct=264.771] They go 3 by 1 here.
[ct=267.403] Mooney in motion.
[ct=270.079] That's a great front four for Washington,
[ct=272.697] And open and making the catch inside the 30-yard line,
[ct=276.690] DJ Moore.
[ct=278.086] So they misfire on the first one but hit the second one.
[ct=281.981] Line did its job, Fields stayed in the pocket,
[ct=284.675] 57 yards over Benjamin St-Juste.
[ct=288.666] The pocket, when the pocket is clean,
[ct=291.293] like any quarterback, Justin Fields especially,
[ct=293.969] he's growing as a pocket quarterback.
[ct=295.279] You see how clean the pocket is there.
[ct=297.941] What he does is he do a good job of reading
[ct=300.594] the safety coming down.
[ct=301.921] Once he saw the safety come down,
[ct=303.305] realized he had a one on one opportunity, St-Juste.
[ct=305.883] gets it lost in coverage, and he makes 'em pay.
[ct=309.895] 58 yards officially, longest completion of the season.
[ct=316.577] Moore came over in the trade.
[ct=317.842] Meanwhile, a timeout is taken here just a minute and a half
[ct=323.164] into the game.
[ct=325.858] So he'll go to the bench, discuss it with Getsy.
[ct=329.813] But you've got to-- hey, what do you have to lose?
[ct=333.795] You're 0 and 4, you start with a bomb, misfire,
[ct=336.481] you come back with another bomb and you hit it.
[ct=337.794] It shows the confidence that they have in him,
[ct=340.481] and this looks like a safety that's going to drop, right?
[ct=343.126] With the snap of the ball, he comes down.
[ct=345.771] Justin Fields recognizes that.
[ct=348.441] Once he starts to sink, now he knows.
[ct=351.071] He recognizes that.
[ct=352.354] Now he knows he's got exactly what he wants.
[ct=355.219] As I said, St-Juste, 25, just kind of
[ct=356.579] gets lost there in coverage.
[ct=357.846] You don't know if that's a bust or what,
[ct=360.520] but obviously he should not be running free
[ct=363.184] like that on third down.
[ct=364.519] It's a 1-2 punch.
[ct=365.825] That's right.
[ct=367.184] Fields to Moore.
[ct=368.514] Herbert the back.
[ct=372.550] [play call]
[ct=373.787] Fields under center.
[ct=376.496] Herbert, nothing.
[ct=379.123] Again, you're going up against that front four of Washington.
[ct=383.089] You got Allen, you got Payne, you got Sweat,
[ct=385.799] and you got Young, all of them number one draft choices.
[ct=389.855] Even John Ridgeway, who's out there pushing people around,
[ct=393.785] I mean, they can consume offensive linemen,
[ct=396.477] allows their linebackers to get downhill.
[ct=399.106] It really frees up the back end when
[ct=400.485] you have a dominant front like that for Jack Del
[ct=403.101] Rio, the defensive coordinator.
[ct=408.392] Second and 10 from the 16-yard line.
[ct=413.757] Fields, look out.
[ct=415.074] Under pressure.
[ct=416.500] Down he goes 21-yard line.
[ct=417.760] Montez Sweat coming in.
[ct=420.482] That's his fourth sack of the season,
[ct=424.474] setting up third and long.
[ct=425.755] You think you're going to have to chip tonight
[ct=428.451] Wright is just a rookie.
[ct=431.110] He's trying to hold on for dear life against a very
[ct=433.732] underrated defensive end.
[ct=435.101] People talk a lot about Chase Young,
[ct=437.689] Daron Payne, Jonathan Allen.
[ct=439.094] Sometimes, you overlook the game-changing ability
[ct=443.070] of Montez Sweat against the run, and here
[ct=444.364] getting that great pass rush off the edge.
[ct=449.686] 18 sacks, second most in the league.
[ct=453.698] Third and 14.
[ct=456.272] Four-man rush again.
[ct=458.988] Fields to the end zone.
[ct=460.283] Moore, touchdown.
[ct=464.270] So Fields, who had the big first half last week, 20 yards here,
[ct=469.597] down the field they go, 4 catches, 2 passes, 6 plays,
[ct=473.685] 75 yards in a little less than three minutes, and Chicago
[ct=477.622] But watch Percy Butler, the safety.
[ct=480.262] When you have a vertical receiver against two safeties
[ct=482.990] that are high, the linebackers got to be able to get vertical.
[ct=486.923] Watch the safety be influenced here,
[ct=488.262] and that creates the opening to the outside.
[ct=490.928] Again, give Justin Fields a lot of credit.
[ct=493.568] That throw should not be there if the safety is doing his job.
[ct=497.560] And again, he makes him pay on the back end.
[ct=501.579] Extra point by Cairo Santos is good,
[ct=504.183] and just like that on Thursday night Chicago, 7, Washington,
[ct=516.349] Some people just know what road to take.
[ct=518.762] Those are the people who to choose Allstate.
[ct=521.470] The surface road is faster.
[ct=525.497] Not happening.
[ct=526.731] He knows better than any GPS, and he'd point you
[ct=529.428] in Allstate's direction.
[ct=530.738] Go all the way down the road past the big gray warehouse.
[ct=533.412] You're not from around here, so you don't know the back roads.
[ct=536.059] I don't want to be late for the party.
[ct=538.712] I'm going to save us five minutes.
[ct=541.384] You're on the fastest route.
[ct=542.701] Those are the people who know safe drivers save
[ct=545.389] 40% with Allstate.
[ct=546.768] Critics everywhere agree The Creator
[ct=549.393] is the best film of the year.
[ct=550.661] Joshua, take care of it.
[ct=552.000] It's visually stunning and a cinematic masterpiece.
[ct=554.666] I promise to keep us safe.
[ct=555.990] See this film on the biggest screen possible.
[ct=558.664] The Creator, Rated PG-13 and now playing.
[ct=563.979] (RAPPING) We got London on the track.
[ct=566.587] This means I'm war-ready.
[ct=570.571] We come face to face.
[ct=571.915] So if we going to play, we going to play for keeps.
[ct=577.071] We ain't going to stop.
[ct=580.626] We're going to protect this house.
[ct=581.977] Win it out.
[ct=582.919] We protect this house.
[ct=584.612] In the trunk, we're going to protect this house.
[ct=588.572] Against the clout, we're going to protect this house.
[ct=591.228] This month, join the new Subway MVP Rewards Program
[ct=595.207] and get rewarded.
[ct=595.215] Get 50% off any footlong when you join Subway MVP Rewards.
[ct=599.200] So many all-star options.
[ct=600.725] It's just for Subway MVPs, right?
[ct=603.204] You catch on quick, Herbert.
[ct=603.441] Join now and get 50% off any footlong.
[ct=606.627] [whistle blowing]
[ct=607.212] People don't always know how to ask for help,
[ct=609.809] but I believe if we can help we should help.
[ct=615.115] OK, here we go.
[ct=615.286] I got this.
[ct=617.786] I'm good, Tim.
[ct=619.202] Keep her coming.
[ct=620.446] Nice and easy.
[ct=621.630] Hey, we're going to finish this thing, all right?
[ct=623.122] Sometimes people need help asking for help.
[ct=627.111] Righty tighty.
[ct=629.451] That's not coming off.
[ct=631.081] Hey, Tim?
[ct=632.441] Pickle jar is stuck again.
[ct=633.540] Do you need help, Barry?

[ct=649.662] God forbid we ever get booked into the Hotel Transylvania 4.
[ct=653.618] Anyway, there's your United States Capitol.
[ct=657.623] An interesting thing happened after the coin toss.
[ct=660.299] Normally, teams defer almost all the time these days.
[ct=664.265] Chicago won the toss, elected to receive.
[ct=667.021] They're going to be aggressive right from the start.
[ct=669.658] They proved that on that first drive.
[ct=671.026] They backed it up.
[ct=672.338] I mean, they really went after it,
[ct=673.639] continue to trust their quarterback, Justin Fields.
[ct=676.312] You can see why, the potential.
[ct=677.616] It's never been about his physical ability.
[ct=680.393] It's just trying to get him to fit
[ct=681.698] into this scheme and the scheme to fit into his skill set.
[ct=685.705] That's why you get excited about the potential of what
[ct=689.645] he can do.
[ct=691.037] All right, our first look right now.
[ct=692.298] Sam Howell played his college ball
[ct=694.976] at North Carolina, picked in the fifth round.
[ct=697.613] They liked him as a sophomore.
[ct=698.986] I mean, Ron Rivera telling us about how good he looked.
[ct=703.111] Comes out after his junior year.
[ct=705.757] We mentioned not often do you find a franchise quarterback
[ct=709.717] in the fifth.
[ct=711.061] Sometimes, you do find him in the sixth round out of Michigan
[ct=713.705] Yeah.
[ct=715.046] [laughter]
[ct=717.697] Start from the 25 out of the gun.
[ct=721.719] On the ground plowing ahead.
[ct=725.725] Brian Robinson their leading ground-gainer picking up 6.
[ct=729.652] It'll be second down and 4.
[ct=731.030] And Howell is an interesting story.
[ct=732.427] Those first two years at North Carolina in that system,
[ct=736.429] He had a lot of talent around him, a lot of NFL talent
[ct=740.372] They all left after his second year.
[ct=741.701] So his third year, he's breaking in a lot of new people
[ct=744.373] around him, and his production dipped down,
[ct=747.013] and that's why I think he slid down.
[ct=749.642] But this guy has a ton of ability
[ct=751.054] and plays a tremendous poise.
[ct=752.346] 92 TDs in three years with the Tar Heels, and that
[ct=756.436] should be a first down on a pass here
[ct=759.041] to the tight end, Logan Thomas.
[ct=761.695] They're going to spot it just a little bit
[ct=764.315] short of the 35-yard line.
[ct=765.716] So third down and short now.
[ct=768.333] Stevenson covering on the play.
[ct=769.669] I think with Ron Rivera, he wanted
[ct=772.290] to find a quarterback that could just
[ct=773.629] be a distributor, a guy that processes quickly
[ct=776.689] and can get the ball out to the wealth of talent
[ct=781.598] that they have on the perimeter in the backfield.
[ct=784.248] And they feel that Howell can be that guy.
[ct=788.219] Terry McLaurin is terrific.
[ct=789.616] They have Jahan Dotson, Curtis Samuel.
[ct=793.567] Thomas can catch, as he did on the last play,
[ct=796.195] and he's stuffed in the backfield.
[ct=797.544] So on third and short, Andrew Billings, number 97,
[ct=804.206] envelops Robinson.
[ct=806.859] And it's fourth down.
[ct=808.199] Nick Gates, the center, just gets dominated here
[ct=813.523] by Billings in his quickness.
[ct=814.838] He works to the left and just loses his balance.
[ct=817.487] And I tell you what, Billings does flash on film.
[ct=821.448] He's a he's an undersized guy, 311 pounds.
[ct=825.437] So he's got a great lower body strength
[ct=828.094] to be able to show a kind of quickness
[ct=830.774] he has, but he shot that gap there.
[ct=832.091] That was a heck of a play.
[ct=837.430] Fourth and 2.
[ct=838.749] Tress Way comes in.
[ct=840.045] Trent Taylor standing back at his own 20 for Chicago.
[ct=852.009] Taylor backs up, fields at the 15,
[ct=857.421] runs it back about 11 yards, and that's
[ct=860.030] where Fields will set up shop as we look at 1600 Pennsylvania
[ct=865.366] Avenue on this Thursday night outside the Nation's Capitol.

[ct=1021.005] This week of the NFL season commencing with this one.
[ct=1024.943] Mentioned Chicago deciding to take the ball, not defer.
[ct=1030.317] How often do teams defer?
[ct=1032.932] 91% of the time.
[ct=1034.328] It paid off.
[ct=1035.643] Come up for their second drive here from the 26-yard line.
[ct=1039.633] Fields is going to keep it, has blocking as well,
[ct=1043.575] and takes it about 7 yards.
[ct=1044.899] That's what they want to do is get him on the edge.
[ct=1047.520] This first drive just tuning in.
[ct=1048.897] Al mentioned it.
[ct=1050.223] An aggressive mindset.
[ct=1051.573] Number one, they take the ball after winning the toss.
[ct=1052.852] Number two, they put the ball in the hands of Justin Fields.
[ct=1056.840] Most importantly, gave him room to work.
[ct=1059.563] And Justin Fields, the quarterback, like most of them
[ct=1062.189] out there, when they feel comfortable what's
[ct=1063.626] in front of them, able to focus downfield and make
[ct=1067.583] Could not have been a better way to start this game than what
[ct=1071.499] they did that opening drive for Justin and the Bears.
[ct=1075.530] After a 7-yard gain, second down and 3.
[ct=1080.829] First down.
[ct=1082.178] Making the grab at the 40-yard line.
[ct=1083.546] Robert Tonyan, longtime Green Bay Packer,
[ct=1087.436] came over as a free agent in the offseason.
[ct=1090.132] The other thing you see, and I think
[ct=1091.435] it's a carryover from last week, you
[ct=1092.803] got to give Luke Getsy a lot of credit,
[ct=1095.415] the ball is getting out fast, much faster
[ct=1098.125] than it was earlier in this year.
[ct=1099.408] And it just tells you that they're
[ct=1102.134] building this scheme around Justin Fields where
[ct=1104.736] he's comfortable.
[ct=1106.097] When a quarterback is comfortable and he has answers,
[ct=1107.410] you could see it in the way his eyes are working
[ct=1110.073] and how quickly the ball gets out,
[ct=1111.409] and that's kind of that mode he's playing in right now.
[ct=1119.334] Line does its job again.
[ct=1120.715] The catch, though, is not made by Darnell Mooney.
[ct=1126.051] Second down and 10.
[ct=1127.323] We go to Kaylee.
[ct=1128.650] Al, nobody on this Bears team is hiding from this losing streak.
[ct=1131.293] Justin Fields understands the reality of it all.
[ct=1133.975] Darnell Mooney told me with each loss
[ct=1135.507] it seems like Fields gets even more locked in and intense,
[ct=1139.258] determined to turn this around.
[ct=1140.613] He said you can see it on the quarterback's face
[ct=1143.236] and how he communicates.
[ct=1144.617] And Mooney said no matter whether you
[ct=1145.951] have a good or a bad day at practice,
[ct=1148.570] Fields is also the guy always cheering the guys on.
[ct=1152.568] Kept a positive attitude.
[ct=1155.218] Much easier said than done.
[ct=1157.833] Ain't easy.
[ct=1159.204] Pass to the outside.
[ct=1160.526] Nice move to the inside, and then DJ Moore a little short
[ct=1165.806] of the first down.
[ct=1167.174] Remember, Chicago had the number one pick in the draft,
[ct=1169.786] traded it to Carolina.
[ct=1171.219] They wanted to get Bryce Young and they did.
[ct=1172.556] And this guy also went in as part of the trade,
[ct=1175.214] and Carolina didn't want to get rid of him obviously.
[ct=1179.207] But to make the deal, they had to get him.
[ct=1181.821] Yeah, and now he's so versatile.
[ct=1184.517] Meanwhile, third and 1, and they're
[ct=1185.807] going to try to run the tush push here as they
[ct=1189.792] got to the line in a hurry.
[ct=1191.587] And where are they going to mark this thing?
[ct=1195.117] He kept driving his legs.
[ct=1196.467] But the great thing about DJ Moore,
[ct=1197.805] it gives him a legit number one receiver.
[ct=1199.122] That's why they went out and got him,
[ct=1201.754] and this is Justin Fields using his power.
[ct=1203.110] People forget he's 6' 3," about 230 pounds.
[ct=1207.109] So he is a powerful quarterback.
[ct=1208.425] And keep an eye on him.
[ct=1209.741] He's still in the middle of this.
[ct=1211.072] Like watch him.
[ct=1212.447] Watch him continue.
[ct=1213.706] He keeps moving guys.
[ct=1215.062] See him there at the top continue that leg drive.
[ct=1217.707] It's like a Jalen Hurts style of quarterback sneak there.
[ct=1224.372] As we mentioned, I'm sure the competition committee
[ct=1225.711] and the meetings next year are going to look at that play
[ct=1228.299] because, I mean, it's the ugliest play in football.
[ct=1232.409] But it's effective.
[ct=1233.698] But to finish on Moore, he can catch those quick throws yards
[ct=1236.454] after the catch, but they're going
[ct=1237.705] to want to take shots downfield today to him as well.
[ct=1244.343] Fields, get him out of the pocket, throws.
[ct=1247.025] Grabbed by Tonyan.
[ct=1249.848] Out of bounds right there at the--
[ct=1252.480] after about a 2-yard gain, that time
[ct=1255.141] Chase Young chasing Fields.
[ct=1256.465] This is a game within a game of the ends.
[ct=1259.106] Chase Young on one side, Montez Sweat on the other.
[ct=1263.112] They're going to line up wide, and their whole goal
[ct=1264.437] is we got to keep Justin Fields in the pocket.
[ct=1267.127] Nobody knows that better than Chase Young, who
[ct=1269.724] was a teammate with Justin Fields in 2019
[ct=1272.430] at Ohio State and good friends.
[ct=1275.072] So he, of course, is going to try
[ct=1276.422] to do the best he can to harass his good friend.
[ct=1280.385] Young trying to stay healthy.
[ct=1281.724] He's been a problem the last couple of years.
[ct=1283.014] Meanwhile, big hole exploited on the right side.
[ct=1287.437] Herbert inside the 15-yard line.
[ct=1291.402] Tony Barton saved a touchdown.
[ct=1293.006] Wright and Davis, the right guard and right
[ct=1296.933] tackle, providing a huge hole.
[ct=1299.633] The motion really affects this defense,
[ct=1302.237] and they bust the gap control.
[ct=1304.897] Good job by this offensive line, not just in protection,
[ct=1307.564] but a good job of climbing up to that second level,
[ct=1310.233] and they're protecting the edges because of the threat
[ct=1312.852] of the quarterback.
[ct=1314.222] And it opens up the middle.
[ct=1316.852] Gain of 34.
[ct=1318.232] Fields just fires that one away.
[ct=1320.817] Being chased there.
[ct=1323.543] Tick under six minutes to go in the opening first quarter,
[ct=1326.153] which has been all Chicago.
[ct=1328.804] It's the short week every week on Thursday night.
[ct=1331.449] But in this short week, Ron Rivera
[ct=1334.138] knows that his defense with Jack Del Rio, they've
[ct=1336.782] got to stop the threat of Fields running.
[ct=1339.415] Anybody who defends Chicago, the first thing they talk about
[ct=1342.153] is we've got to take care of the edges.
[ct=1348.717] and Chicago knows that, and they've put together
[ct=1350.056] a nice plan there to try to take advantage
[ct=1352.715] of those edges being protected.
[ct=1356.726] Play action.
[ct=1360.911] Cole Kmet loses the ball.
[ct=1362.241] The man has scored 2 touchdowns last week, hit by Daron Payne,
[ct=1368.901] and a scramble to find out who's at the bottom of that pile.
[ct=1372.869] Daron Payne retracing, and he brought that right club
[ct=1379.557] to try to get that football away from the big tight end.
[ct=1383.485] Kmet is 6' 6," 260.
[ct=1384.830] Look at this club.
[ct=1386.149] Bang!
[ct=1387.777] It's on the ground, and Kmet very
[ct=1390.358] fortunate it just ends up right underneath him
[ct=1392.994] and he's able to secure it.
[ct=1394.348] How about that retrace by the big fella?
[ct=1397.012] Knocks that ball loose.
[ct=1401.001] Right under the right hamstring.
[ct=1402.314] Collects it.
[ct=1403.675] Keeps possession.
[ct=1404.979] Third and 9.
[ct=1413.022] They go 5 wide here.
[ct=1414.344] Pass is caught.
[ct=1415.728] And trying to get that first down backing toward the line
[ct=1419.668] to gain but a little short is Cole Kmet once again.
[ct=1424.964] So fourth down and 1.
[ct=1426.336] The Commanders do a good job of anticipating that route.
[ct=1430.337] Keep the big tight end short of the first down.
[ct=1431.650] But if you're a Bears fan, first possession you go down,
[ct=1435.627] And now, you've got a shot at a field goal to go up 10-0.
[ct=1439.641] This is a team that was up big last week
[ct=1440.906] and couldn't hold on against Denver,
[ct=1442.267] and they're getting points here early playing aggressively.
[ct=1446.240] Again, not that aggressively otherwise
[ct=1448.897] you'd be going for it right here.
[ct=1451.547] Right.
[ct=1452.850] 22-yard field goal attempt is good.
[ct=1458.222] So they gained 145 yards to 8 for Washington
[ct=1463.496] early on as the Bears hot in the first half
[ct=1466.154] again take a 10-0 advantage.
[ct=1475.418] Yo.
[ct=1476.776] It's the fine fragrance GOAT.
[ct=1486.094] Smell finer than the finest fragrances with the GOAT.
[ct=1512.634] Pause for hydration.
[ct=1515.301] Stop for nothing.
[ct=1517.909] Essentia.
[ct=1520.641] Patrick, Jake from State Farm, explain this bundling thing
[ct=1523.250] again.
[ct=1525.906] your car, right?
[ct=1527.243] Uh-huh.
[ct=1528.580] And this burger is your home.
[ct=1531.226] OK.
[ct=1532.577] It can be more affordable if you bundle them together.
[ct=1535.228] Kind of like a combo meal.
[ct=1537.844] Mmm.
[ct=1539.213] Explain it again with those nuggies.
[ct=1541.818] Bundling, just another way to save with the Personal Price
[ct=1545.803] Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[ct=1548.526] (SINGING) Only $5, Whopper Jr times two.
[ct=1551.294] Double the Jr.'s.
[ct=1552.512] That's your cue.
[ct=1553.485] One for you, one for your friend to go.
[ct=1555.822] JK, you ate them both.
[ct=1556.991] They'll never know.
[ct=1558.010] BK, it have it your way.
[ct=1562.241] You rule.
[ct=1566.398] Catch NFL+.
[ct=1568.536] I catch NFL Network, and I catch every touchdown every Sunday
[ct=1573.178] afternoon on NFL RedZone.
[ct=1574.675] Catch it all on NFL+.
[ct=1577.176] For a limited time, get 50% off a yearly--
[ct=1581.293] Well, a lot of one term quarterbacks here
[ct=1584.830] in our Nation's Captiol.
[ct=1584.881] Since 2017, Kirk Cousins was here.
[ct=1587.734] He was one of three starting quarterbacks
[ct=1589.763] that year in each of the last five seasons.
[ct=1592.820] They've used at least three starting quarterbacks.
[ct=1597.518] And now Sam Howell is the man at the podium.
[ct=1600.553] Fourth youngest active starting quarterback at 23.
[ct=1605.354] Just turned 23 last month.
[ct=1608.169] So, you know, you're always looking for that franchise guy.
[ct=1611.740] Who in the world would believe all of those seasons not only
[ct=1615.909] two starting quarterbacks, but three
[ct=1618.405] in every one of those years?
[ct=1620.266] And we were talking this morning.
[ct=1621.244] You go back to Sonny Jurgensen and Billy Kilmer and Joe
[ct=1625.243] What, they had a good 20, 25-year run
[ct=1627.685] with just three guys.
[ct=1629.002] And since then, boy, it's been a lot of different quarterback
[ct=1634.944] chances and opportunities.
[ct=1637.300] Santos will send that one through the end zone.
[ct=1643.154] Washington will start from the 25-yard line.
[ct=1647.343] Look at those names.
[ct=1649.322] Mark Rypien of course had a good run.
[ct=1650.693] Kirk Cousins was here and got things going,
[ct=1653.327] but you see after 57 games he is now in Minnesota.
[ct=1658.283] Well, over a decade ago there's Robert Griffin at the bottom.
[ct=1661.089] At one point, man, he looked like he was the guy.
[ct=1664.320] That was the answer.
[ct=1665.327] And he got hurt, Mike Shanahan was here,
[ct=1667.022] and here's Eric Bieniemy, a great story in it of himself.
[ct=1669.929] He comes over here as the offensive coordinator.
[ct=1674.402] From the 25-yard line.
[ct=1679.478] Howell surveying, looking, decides to take off.
[ct=1683.444] With Bieniemy, I mean, obviously he's
[ct=1684.846] been interviewed for a head coaching jobs all
[ct=1687.825] I don't know how many times now, but he was always
[ct=1690.060] under the shadow of Andy Reid.
[ct=1690.642] And the knock was, wait a second, Andy is the offense.
[ct=1693.426] Andy calls the plays.
[ct=1694.751] So Eric decides, hey man, I got to get out of that shadow,
[ct=1697.197] and Ron Rivera hires him.
[ct=1699.080] I think anytime you want to have an opportunity to become a head
[ct=1701.357] coach and you're an offensive-minded guy
[ct=1704.048] and you're working for an offensive head coach,
[ct=1705.419] you do have to go out and do your own thing.
[ct=1707.985] This is a huge chance here with this offense,
[ct=1710.414] and he's very optimistic about what they can do this year.
[ct=1714.387] You'll hear from Scott Novak, our referee, for the first time
[ct=1718.682] tonight.
[ct=1721.433] False start, offense, number 3.
[ct=1724.054] That's a 5-yard penalty.
[ct=1725.606] Second down.
[ct=1728.784] Byron Pringle batting himself on the helmet.
[ct=1732.440] And if you look around the quarterback position,
[ct=1734.239] we talked earlier about McLaurin and Curtis Samuel and Dotson,
[ct=1738.244] who they picked up, Dyami Brown.
[ct=1739.518] In the backfield, Brian Robinson, Antonio Gibson.
[ct=1742.552] There's a lot of skill to work with.
[ct=1745.166] The big thing is can Sam Howell deliver
[ct=1747.862] and be able to be the guy.
[ct=1749.430] Robinson, the defense does its job again.
[ct=1756.022] Stopped.
[ct=1757.366] Short gain right there.
[ct=1758.681] Yannick Ngakoue, DeMarcus Walker both there.
[ct=1761.360] It'll be third and 11.
[ct=1762.366] This is a defense that has struggled.
[ct=1766.357] This is a group that has not done a great job of getting off
[ct=1770.505] the field.
[ct=1771.835] They're dead last in third down defense.
[ct=1773.184] Not done a good job of pressuring opposing
[ct=1775.827] quarterbacks.
[ct=1777.143] Only 2 sacks.
[ct=1778.456] So right now, I don't know if they're feeling it
[ct=1779.843] because of the way their own offense is playing,
[ct=1782.425] but they're aggressive themselves.
[ct=1783.800] Well, Allen Williams was the defensive coordinator.
[ct=1786.417] He had to resign.
[ct=1787.774] So Eberflus is now calling the defense.
[ct=1790.804] Third down and 11.
[ct=1792.105] Deep drop.
[ct=1793.436] Howell is going to take off and not go very far.
[ct=1796.068] DeMarcus Walker is there again.
[ct=1798.800] So the Washington Commanders, 3 and out
[ct=1804.092] on their first two drives, still do not have a first down.
[ct=1808.041] Have been outgained 145 yards to 12.
[ct=1810.728] Bring a blitz here and the safety instead of dropping,
[ct=1813.411] he ends up coming down.
[ct=1814.713] So they're trying to confuse this young quarterback, which
[ct=1817.339] he thought they would do.
[ct=1818.685] It's a smart thing to do pre-snap
[ct=1821.330] to post-snap, giving him different looks, especially
[ct=1823.984] on third down.
[ct=1829.306] Way, his second punt.
[ct=1830.622] Trent Taylor waiting for it.
[ct=1837.314] Drifting.
[ct=1838.578] Makes the grab, avoids the first man,
[ct=1839.944] and he takes it back out to the 31-yard line.
[ct=1844.276] 1:52 remaining in the opening quarter.
[ct=1848.078] 10 to 0, Chicago.
[ct=1855.485] LeBron stands alone.
[ct=1861.107] Oh.
[ct=1862.196] 5, 4, 3, 2.
[ct=1864.888] Goal.
[ct=1866.434] Are you not entertained?
[ct=1868.572] He just brought the house down.
[ct=1872.295] What a play.
[ct=1873.131] This is March.
[ct=1876.609] Put you front row.
[ct=1877.893] Let your tongue show.
[ct=1879.560] Are you kidding me?
[ct=1884.382] This is a clustomer.
[ct=1885.991] It happens when marketers group all their customers together.
[ct=1889.683] Mailchimp uses real time behavior data
[ct=1891.354] so you can personalize email for every customer.
[ct=1894.154] Turn clustomers into customers with Intuit Mailchimp.
[ct=1898.540] Have you ever noticed how tourism commercials
[ct=1900.303] use camera angles to make things look big and exciting?
[ct=1905.366] They make you think, wow, that looks like an epic vacation.
[ct=1910.973] Is it working?
[ct=1912.604] How about now?
[ct=1914.973] You don't need to use camera magic to make
[ct=1917.667] this vacation look exciting.
[ct=1918.690] It actually is.
[ct=1921.224] This is our go big or go home trip to Texas.
[ct=1924.879] Go get your own.
[ct=1929.161] 6' 5," 324 catches, 20 carries, all the Sauce.
[ct=1938.238] In this game, numbers are everything, so call yours.
[ct=1949.197] I'm war-ready.
[ct=1954.078] So if we going to play we going to play for keeps.
[ct=1961.552] We going to protect this house.
[ct=1963.857] When it doubt, we going to protect his house.
[ct=1966.569] In the trunk, we going to protect this house.
[ct=1977.635] A week from tonight, Thursday Night Football,
[ct=1978.924] we're going to Kansas City.
[ct=1980.262] That means Patrick Mahomes against the Broncos
[ct=1984.246] with Russell Wilson.
[ct=1985.596] Broncos affecting the huge comeback against Chicago.
[ct=1988.237] I think Travis Kelce will be there.
[ct=1989.598] God knows who else next week in Kansas City.
[ct=1994.953] Meanwhile here, a couple of changes.
[ct=1997.651] Offensively, you got Tevin Jenkins comes in.
[ct=2000.280] He's been hurt and he's going to take over
[ct=2002.934] at left guard for Cody White here.
[ct=2005.587] Talking about Chase Claypool in our introduction tonight.
[ct=2009.867] Not here, of course, for the second straight game
[ct=2012.505] and told to basically stay home.
[ct=2015.325] Leshon Johnson is now in the backfield.
[ct=2019.272] Pass caught.
[ct=2020.911] Moore, great spin move to the inside.
[ct=2022.272] Off he goes again.
[ct=2023.572] What a first half for him.
[ct=2024.912] And finally, after he breaks the tackle of the rookie, Forbes,
[ct=2030.222] another long-gainer.
[ct=2031.575] And another first and 10 pass, play action pass,
[ct=2035.515] for the Bears and Luke Getsy, and it's a great job.
[ct=2038.130] You've got to beat the rookie one on one.
[ct=2039.476] One of the top receivers, nice little push off,
[ct=2042.117] Yards after the catch has got to be something
[ct=2046.133] the Bears can do tonight, and there's a great example
[ct=2048.786] of that by number 2.
[ct=2051.436] On the ground.
[ct=2052.773] Man, you've got DJ Moore on your fantasy league,
[ct=2056.783] he's already gone for 126 yards.
[ct=2063.429] Go to the caviar jar.
[ct=2064.750] That's not a bad start.
[ct=2066.032] He had a great game last week too when
[ct=2067.384] they went against Denver where he ended up having
[ct=2070.022] over 100 yards receiving.
[ct=2071.374] So he's clearly their guy.
[ct=2072.710] I'll tell you, Luke Getsy he's got
[ct=2074.014] to feel really good about this plan
[ct=2075.374] right now, mixing up formations, personnel groupings,
[ct=2078.022] pre-snap movement, and has a quarterback that's in his own.
[ct=2084.632] Second and 5.
[ct=2088.643] Another big hole.
[ct=2089.935] That's Roschon Johnson, a rookie picked in the fourth round out
[ct=2095.273] How about that offensive line?
[ct=2096.596] You mentioned Jenkins coming in.
[ct=2097.994] He gets going here early getting involved.
[ct=2102.044] You'll see the left tackle able to climb up.
[ct=2103.424] Larry Borum opens up that hole, and I love Johnson.
[ct=2107.378] Just a downhill runner, puts his foot in the ground,
[ct=2111.442] and builds up that momentum.
[ct=2112.788] And what a collision with Derek Forrest there.
[ct=2116.132] That Bears offensive line missing two starters
[ct=2119.435] Rookie right tackle dominating the line of scrimmage.
[ct=2123.537] Waning seconds of the quarter.
[ct=2132.869] Gets it away, just flings it and flings it out of bounds.
[ct=2135.529] So Chase Young almost got him, couldn't, and that's
[ct=2139.503] the way the first quarter ends.
[ct=2142.114] There is no foul for intentional grounding.
[ct=2144.856] Second down, and this is the end of the first quarter.
[ct=2148.803] They wanted international, do not get it.
[ct=2150.103] End of the quarter.
[ct=2151.447] 10 to 0, Bears, and back right after these messages.
[ct=2160.756] For 120 years at JCPenney, we believed
[ct=2163.432] if you're going to do something, do it all the way.
[ct=2167.370] We give 100% every day because it's who we are
[ct=2171.361] and who you are too.
[ct=2174.014] So seize the moment.
[ct=2175.345] Get the suit that lands the job.
[ct=2176.689] Set the table that brings you together.
[ct=2179.342] Wear the red that brightens the room.
[ct=2181.972] And give the ring that changes everything.
[ct=2184.661] Every day is a new opportunity.
[ct=2188.612] JCPenney, make it count.
[ct=2191.281] Man, I wish I was out there.
[ct=2193.928] Let's un-retire.
[ct=2195.280] Why not?
[ct=2196.607] (SINGING) Guess who's back, back again?
[ct=2201.921] Dan Marino?
[ct=2203.241] You all right?
[ct=2204.540] 22, 22.
[ct=2209.881] Delay of game, number 13.
[ct=2213.856] I'm good right here, bro.
[ct=2217.831] Don't even think about it.
[ct=2225.844] How can you tell which one's the better deal?
[ct=2228.462] Bring in dad from Sarasota.
[ct=2231.167] Dads are--
[ct=2232.431] US Marine Corps War Memorial with the Washington Monument
[ct=2236.423] in the background on this Thursday night.
[ct=2240.413] Al Michaels with Kirk Herbstreit, Kaylee Hartung.
[ct=2243.261] Our rules expert is Terry McAulay.
[ct=2245.935] We're going to weigh in a second with Terry
[ct=2247.249] on that last play of the first quarter.
[ct=2252.505] The Commanders wanted intentional grounding.
[ct=2258.166] Meanwhile, second down and 10 now.
[ct=2259.185] A little flip here to Johnson for the 10.
[ct=2261.827] Terry, what did you see on that last play?
[ct=2264.461] Well Al, he never got outside the pocket.
[ct=2265.821] So he's got to get the ball in the vicinity of receiver.
[ct=2268.465] He's contacted before he starts his throwing motion.
[ct=2272.872] So it's all on him.
[ct=2274.143] He clearly throws it away from any receiver well out
[ct=2278.153] This should have been a foul for intentional grounding.
[ct=2280.843] Chase Young looking at his former teammate
[ct=2283.456] like what the heck.
[ct=2284.829] Hey, dude.
[ct=2286.106] What's going on here?
[ct=2287.455] Ron Rivera was heated while we were at break about it as well.
[ct=2291.441] Yeah?
[ct=2292.800] Shaved a few yards.
[ct=2294.921] Third down and 6.
[ct=2302.099] Reaching up.
[ct=2303.351] Does he make the catch again?
[ct=2304.761] DJ Moore, touchdown.
[ct=2308.761] He is having a career in one night.
[ct=2312.188] Beats Kendall Fuller again.
[ct=2313.663] That's 11 yards for the touchdown.
[ct=2316.284] He's already caught 5 for 137 and 2 scores.
[ct=2318.998] How about the throw by Justin Fields?
[ct=2322.143] A little slant and go.
[ct=2323.293] Perfect placement.
[ct=2323.395] Fuller never locates the football.
[ct=2324.904] And Moore so comfortable being able to get his feet down.
[ct=2328.318] Watch this route.
[ct=2329.293] Watch Fuller bite on it man to man.
[ct=2331.786] Ooh!
[ct=2332.842] A little inside move, and the throw
[ct=2334.166] could not have been any better by Justin Fields.
[ct=2340.559] What were you saying about fantasy for DJ Moore?
[ct=2343.959] What a night in the first 16 minutes of the game.
[ct=2349.306] 17-0, and we will be back, we promise, in 30 seconds.
[ct=2367.501] (RAPPING) California on my license plate.
[ct=2370.123] Last year, they ain't even like the back.
[ct=2374.965] The wheel never trips.
[ct=2376.250] Those guys back there.
[ct=2377.564] Knowing we never choke on that bill.
[ct=2380.601] No I can't quit.
[ct=2382.589] Put me on son.
[ct=2390.741] If you're a Bears fan, if you're a half full guy, you go wow.
[ct=2396.091] Look at this, if you're a half empty guy,
[ct=2397.423] you're going we saw this last week.
[ct=2398.727] Exactly.
[ct=2399.788] How about the start of this game with what the Bears have done
[ct=2402.752] offensively and what we've not seen
[ct=2404.856] at all from the Commanders?
[ct=2407.910] You compare this total plays.
[ct=2409.247] Look at the yards, the first downs, two 3 and outs
[ct=2414.537] for the Commanders.
[ct=2414.984] That 1-2 punch, Fields to Moore.
[ct=2418.666] Washington still nary a first down begins
[ct=2423.847] this drive at the 25.
[ct=2425.687] It just feels like a game on a short week
[ct=2427.279] where one team so far has shown up
[ct=2430.702] with a chip on their shoulder, and they
[ct=2433.089] want to win a football game, and the Commanders a bit
[ct=2435.309] lethargic off to a slow start.
[ct=2437.744] They've got to find a way to regroup here and fight back
[ct=2441.045] to get back into this game.
[ct=2443.599] Sure some people thinking 0 and 4, 14 straight losses,
[ct=2446.653] it's a mess, you're a dead dog coming to town.
[ct=2449.726] It's 17 to 0.
[ct=2458.469] Toss here to the outside.
[ct=2459.812] Again, that defense does a great job.
[ct=2462.288] Robinson tackled that time by Terrell Smith,
[ct=2466.267] a rookie out of Minnesota.
[ct=2467.249] They picked him in the fifth round.
[ct=2469.833] Just to remind people that aren't familiar with it,
[ct=2470.509] the Bears are down three of their five defensive backs
[ct=2473.156] when you include the nickelback, Kyler Gordon.
[ct=2475.867] Both their corners, your corner and a safety Eddie Jackson
[ct=2480.190] So you got Terrell Smith, who just made a great play, Tyrique
[ct=2484.010] You got two rookies holding up at corner, not just
[ct=2485.706] in coverage, but also in run support right there.
[ct=2489.463] Russell Wilson able to shred them
[ct=2490.359] last week in that second half.
[ct=2492.871] Second down and 8.
[ct=2498.076] To the outside, caught, and making the tackle 2 yards shy.
[ct=2503.366] Curtis Samuel making the grab there.
[ct=2507.417] You got Stroman in on the tackle.
[ct=2511.417] They're going to spot the ball at the 33-yard line.
[ct=2516.766] That time, Sam Howell doing a better job making up his mind
[ct=2520.780] and getting the ball out.
[ct=2520.798] That's what Eric Bieniemy really wants
[ct=2522.334] to see from him as he's working.
[ct=2523.660] Again, just his sixth career start, young guy,
[ct=2525.904] but just wants to see him be decisive and work
[ct=2529.884] through his progressions.
[ct=2530.690] That time, ball out quickly to Samuel.
[ct=2534.758] Antonio Gibson is in the backfield.
[ct=2537.479] Flare him out.
[ct=2539.127] Howell throwing.
[ct=2541.799] Catch is made.
[ct=2543.608] Reaching down is Logan Thomas.
[ct=2549.185] Makes the grab, barely stays in bounds,
[ct=2552.078] and is able to pick up their initial first down of the game.
[ct=2556.066] Al, that's a heck of a catch on a third down
[ct=2559.534] to get that first first down.
[ct=2560.847] You know Sanborn's going to blow you up.
[ct=2561.939] That ball was going down.
[ct=2563.469] The spiral was going down.
[ct=2564.776] And at 6' 6," Logan Thomas has to get down there
[ct=2568.124] like he's feeling the ground ball to make that catch.
[ct=2570.749] Heck of an effort.
[ct=2572.186] A split finger.
[ct=2577.263] Gibson, the back.
[ct=2582.790] Got something going here, and maybe a little short
[ct=2588.071] Dotson, who made the grab at the end of regulation last week,
[ct=2590.423] Smith again in on the tackle.
[ct=2592.599] Nice gain there.
[ct=2593.775] Going to spot the ball a little short of the first down.
[ct=2596.589] And again Al, here they are with quicker decisions.
[ct=2599.747] And he's an athletic guy.
[ct=2601.056] They like to get him on the edge too.
[ct=2602.434] I thought Dotson, good job of staying in bounds.
[ct=2604.183] Came so close there to stepping out of bounds,
[ct=2606.881] but a nice quick easy read, ball is out,
[ct=2610.954] get the ball to these receivers against these young corners.
[ct=2615.365] Howell, 4 for his first 4.
[ct=2618.306] Second and 1.
[ct=2623.117] They pick up another first down on a 2-yard gain
[ct=2625.764] here by Robinson.
[ct=2628.685] They are working for every yard in the trenches.
[ct=2632.483] Just like you said, it goes to show you you just never know
[ct=2636.395] from one week to the next.
[ct=2637.768] This Bears defensive front for the most part
[ct=2640.402] has gotten pushed around in the interior with Justin Jones
[ct=2643.139] and Andrew Billings this year, but not the story tonight.
[ct=2647.137] This is a motivated defense that is flying around.
[ct=2650.722] The defense that's allowed 29 points per game
[ct=2653.810] over the last two years.
[ct=2655.403] Worst in the league.
[ct=2659.049] To the outside again they go.
[ct=2661.713] Short gain here, Terry McLaurin.
[ct=2663.461] He gets into the action, making his first grab of the night.
[ct=2667.296] And what the Bears are doing with those young corners,
[ct=2669.846] they're playing a lot of softer coverage.
[ct=2671.265] So you're going to have to take those easy throws and you're
[ct=2674.919] going to have to rely on receivers making plays
[ct=2677.615] after the catch.
[ct=2678.938] You'll take 6 yards.
[ct=2680.232] Eventually either set up double moves
[ct=2682.868] or you set up an opportunity where
[ct=2683.501] you're going to have to go down field and win one on one.
[ct=2688.062] That's Lucas Patrick, the center.
[ct=2692.029] So he's going to go for some attention.
[ct=2693.054] They may move Cody Whitehair, who's played a lot of center
[ct=2696.505] in his career, to that spot.
[ct=2698.311] Play action here.
[ct=2700.005] Howell fires.
[ct=2701.349] Another first down.
[ct=2702.418] And a nice run there by Thomas to pick up about 3 or 4
[ct=2706.162] more yards after contact.
[ct=2708.607] Stroman making the tackle.
[ct=2711.299] This is what Matt Eberflus is known for, this Tampa 2 look,
[ct=2714.251] meaning two high safeties.
[ct=2716.339] The backer's going to get deep, and when you get deep,
[ct=2718.978] you're taking away those shots downfield.
[ct=2720.422] And one thing you heard this week
[ct=2722.439] from Sam Howell on our call--
[ct=2723.745] hey, what's the key in going up against this style of defense?
[ct=2726.295] Well, they're going to play soft.
[ct=2727.810] We know that.
[ct=2729.101] I just got to take what they give me.
[ct=2729.874] I got to be patient, take those underneath throws.
[ct=2733.679] Again, Eberflus calling the defensive signals.
[ct=2739.147] First down at the 39-yard line.
[ct=2743.605] Howell, good protection-- he's going to go to the end zone.
[ct=2748.230] Incomplete.
[ct=2749.473] Dyami Brown was there, his former North Carolina mate.
[ct=2755.286] A little too tall, a little too far.
[ct=2758.154] Now, this is what they're waiting for.
[ct=2759.402] Safety here, safety down, opens up the middle.
[ct=2764.004] Finally a chance to be able to take a shot
[ct=2765.957] downfield, and they've got it.
[ct=2767.209] And when you have it, you got to connect.
[ct=2770.130] Ball is thrown well enough for Dyami Brown, who's a college
[ct=2773.891] teammate of Sam Howell.
[ct=2775.486] They've got great chemistry.
[ct=2776.903] He puts it right in that seam.
[ct=2778.333] Just unable to bring it down.
[ct=2781.518] Howell's first incompletion.
[ct=2785.821] Robinson started one way.
[ct=2786.595] Goes the other, and that doesn't fool Andrew Billings,
[ct=2790.692] having a nice night.
[ct=2793.388] Brown has the speed to be able to hit those seams, but just
[ct=2798.682] over the fingertips there.
[ct=2802.695] He's thinking, man, we had it.
[ct=2806.632] Got to hit it.
[ct=2825.163] Blitz coming, pressure.
[ct=2826.592] Howell backpedals.
[ct=2827.677] Howell going deep.
[ct=2828.777] Into traffic, and it's incomplete.
[ct=2832.707] Dotson almost was able to make the grab.
[ct=2835.551] We got a flag down, though.
[ct=2836.917] There's a flag on the far side of the field at the 36-yard
[ct=2840.453] line, which is 3 yards--
[ct=2841.968] --beyond scrimmage.
[ct=2843.305] Defense, number 90, lined up in the neutral zone.
[ct=2845.768] 5-yard penalty.
[ct=2847.315] Third down.
[ct=2847.548] So that's Dominique Robinson.
[ct=2850.892] A little bit of a killer there in the sense
[ct=2853.614] that was a third and 9.
[ct=2854.710] It's going to make it third down and 4.
[ct=2857.148] Remember, in the open, you said, how do they win?
[ct=2858.509] And we talked about they got to quit self-destructing.
[ct=2861.146] It's not just penalties.
[ct=2862.519] It's the time of these penalties.
[ct=2863.837] They're off the field here.
[ct=2865.114] Now it's fourth and 9, and now it's third and 4,
[ct=2869.873] and you give Howell another chance.
[ct=2871.251] Yep.
[ct=2871.385] They're off the field and maybe not even in field goal range,
[ct=2875.645] were it not for the penalty.
[ct=2876.934] Third down and 4.
[ct=2879.155] They had the all-out blitz going on the last one.
[ct=2882.094] What do they do here?
[ct=2884.911] Coming again.
[ct=2885.811] A flag is thrown.
[ct=2886.978] Tipped!
[ct=2887.382] And for the moment, dropped.
[ct=2888.534] Almost picked off, but it's dropped.
[ct=2892.431] Hit by Edmunds.
[ct=2892.726] You saw the flag come in at the snap.
[ct=2899.469] Illegal shift on the offense.
[ct=2900.824] Two players were moving the same time and did not reset.
[ct=2904.442] Penalty's declined.
[ct=2905.706] Fourth down.
[ct=2907.107] So that makes it fourth and 4.
[ct=2914.327] And Slye's going to come in for a long field goal attempt.
[ct=2925.289] Joey Slye-- fifth year out of Virginia Tech.
[ct=2928.571] 51-yard attempt, no wind to speak of.
[ct=2935.285] Tress Way to put it down.
[ct=2939.014] And Slye's kick is perfect.
[ct=2943.189] Eight and a half to go in the first half.
[ct=2947.327] Washington on the board, but trailing 17-3
[ct=2950.192] to the Chicago Bears.
[ct=2957.175] You took something that didn't belong to you.
[ct=2959.794] The Equalizer 3 comes home--
[ct=2962.277] I'm here to get it back.
[ct=2962.566] --with a 94% audience score.
[ct=2964.932] Are you warning me?
[ct=2966.201] I'm preparing you.
[ct=2968.907] The Equalizer 3.
[ct=2970.287] Buy or rent now, and in theaters, rated R.
[ct=2972.893] OK, quick and easy weeknight dinner that's not chicken
[ct=2976.698] nuggets.
[ct=2976.962] Ham-and-cheese crescent rolls are
[ct=2979.368] as easy as fill, roll, bake.
[ct=2983.067] Is there enough for seconds?
[ct=2984.400] Fill, roll, bake--
[ct=2985.735] [giggles]
[ct=2988.535] (SINGING) Hey, you, can we come together?
[ct=2995.816] Hey, you can we--
[ct=3000.982] We got now.
[ct=3002.360] We're seeing EVs more every day.
[ct=3007.447] Good to know there's one that can still make
[ct=3010.069] people say, you don't see that every day,
[ct=3016.709] because it's the only EV that's an F-150.
[ct=3024.030] The all-electric F-150 Lightning.
[ct=3030.108] [ozzy osbourne, "crazy train"]
[ct=3032.016] (SINGING) All aboard!
[ct=3032.668] [cackles] Ay!
[ct=3043.636] You're welcome, America.
[ct=3047.995] Thursday Night--
[ct=3049.318] Let's take a look at our Thursday Spotlight,
[ct=3050.850] presented by Pepsi.
[ct=3051.711] And it's Justin Fields off to a great start,
[ct=3053.883] reading, recognizing opportunities, seeing safeties
[ct=3058.103] out of position, which we've seen a lot of here
[ct=3060.718] in this first half.
[ct=3061.869] You can see his eyes just locked in on his reads.
[ct=3063.394] And of course, he has the arm strength to make those throws.
[ct=3067.200] So this first half could not have started any better.
[ct=3069.684] Of course, last week, we saw much of the same
[ct=3071.550] in the Denver game, and they are focused
[ct=3074.501] on playing for 60 minutes.
[ct=3077.131] It was the start last week.
[ct=3078.446] Yeah, last week he completed his first 16, 17.
[ct=3081.116] I think it was a long Hail Mary at the end of the half that
[ct=3084.416] fell incomplete.
[ct=3085.711] Tonight-- 9 of 13, 156.
[ct=3088.419] And of course his main man has been
[ct=3089.951] Moore, who has caught a total of five passes
[ct=3095.098] on five targets for 137.
[ct=3109.486] Joey Slye, after booting a 51-yard field goal,
[ct=3114.718] with the touchback here.
[ct=3116.958] And we go to Kaylee.
[ct=3118.289] Al, the Bears center Lucas Patrick--
[ct=3119.301] he has left the field to be evaluated for a concussion,
[ct=3122.177] so now Cody Whitehair is going to slide over to center.
[ct=3125.618] He started every game this year at left guard,
[ct=3128.352] but he does have 60 career starts at center.
[ct=3130.941] I saw him taking a couple of practice
[ct=3132.584] snaps with Justin Fields.
[ct=3134.009] He added tape to all five fingers on his right hand,
[ct=3138.341] and now he'll get a chance to slide over and see
[ct=3140.535] how this O-line can make it work without Patrick.
[ct=3143.456] Yeah, he's back.
[ct=3143.567] Once, he began his career out of Kansas State
[ct=3147.530] as a second-round pick.
[ct=3151.164] Fields lining up in the gun here.
[ct=3157.428] He'll keep it.
[ct=3160.240] It's a block there from Blasingame.
[ct=3162.413] Run out by Curl after a gain of 6.
[ct=3167.071] That's the beautiful thing when this offense is
[ct=3169.749] going the way it is with a lot of first-and-10 passing,
[ct=3172.182] and you've seen the run game tonight with Herbert.
[ct=3174.473] They can get back to their bread and butter, which is getting
[ct=3178.233] Justin Fields out on the edge.
[ct=3179.751] Look at the yardage you pick up on first and 10.
[ct=3181.391] It's almost like Washington gets lulled to sleep,
[ct=3185.111] worried about other aspects of the offense,
[ct=3186.645] and it frees him up to pick up some positive yards there.
[ct=3195.147] Second and 3.
[ct=3196.405] Fakes the give, fires over the middle.
[ct=3199.441] Making the grab there and getting
[ct=3200.785] into Washington territory is Cole Kmet, the 6' 6"
[ct=3205.023] 260-pounder.
[ct=3205.834] Two TDs last week, big gain here, 24 yards.
[ct=3209.858] That was a good job of DJ Moore clearing things out.
[ct=3212.835] And here's the big man right here.
[ct=3214.214] Just sits in the open space.
[ct=3216.771] Linebackers have to respect the play action.
[ct=3219.717] They sink in.
[ct=3219.964] Fields gets pressured late, but what a target.
[ct=3223.707] What a luxury to throw to Kmet at 6' 6"
[ct=3226.652] in the middle of that defense.
[ct=3230.191] He is a big-time target, and Justin Fields like his security
[ct=3234.348] blanket.
[ct=3234.750] From the 45.
[ct=3238.998] Herbert, behind blocking, gets about 3.
[ct=3245.507] Payne making the stop.
[ct=3247.907] Down to seven minutes to go in the half.
[ct=3250.580] 14-point Chicago lead.
[ct=3251.899] Al, you'll love this.
[ct=3253.265] Even when it's not working, it works somewhat.
[ct=3256.458] It's been that kind of night.
[ct=3257.800] Watch the left guard, Jenkins, pull around.
[ct=3260.434] They've been opening up holes here, but watch him.
[ct=3263.118] Stumbles out of the gate.
[ct=3264.426] They still get positive yards when the guard doesn't even
[ct=3267.623] pull around to pick up the linebacker.
[ct=3272.937] 72 rushing yards, 10 carries.
[ct=3276.776] That's 7 yards per tote.
[ct=3278.161] Second and 7.
[ct=3282.058] Fake toss.
[ct=3283.436] Fields buys time.
[ct=3284.757] Fields throwing that one incomplete.
[ct=3286.322] He had Mooney and Kmet both in the neighborhood.
[ct=3290.305] Payne, that time, converged with Allen.
[ct=3292.843] Third and 7.
[ct=3293.999] Much better job, not just by the front,
[ct=3296.673] but on the back end for this Ron Rivera and Jack Del Rio
[ct=3300.626] defense.
[ct=3301.950] They not falling for the misdirection.
[ct=3305.972] A little fake there to Khalil Herbert on the pitch, and then
[ct=3309.952] came back the other way, but the discipline
[ct=3312.567] and this sound defense there by Washington.
[ct=3327.175] Enough for the first down as they give it to him.
[ct=3329.956] Inside draw.
[ct=3332.563] Nate Davis helping to lead the way.
[ct=3338.554] And going no-huddle here.
[ct=3342.455] Fourth and inches is what they're going to call it now.
[ct=3346.451] And again, does he make it?
[ct=3347.798] They say nothing yet.
[ct=3353.710] Man, looked like he had the first down
[ct=3355.759] on the third-down play, but he run up
[ct=3357.126] to the line of scrimmage, spotted it a little short.
[ct=3361.098] Everybody's going to this, especially when you
[ct=3363.761] have a quarterback like a Justin Fields,
[ct=3367.737] with the size that he has.
[ct=3369.059] How about that run on the play before, on that third down,
[ct=3371.766] with Herbert?
[ct=3374.336] Almost, again, doesn't matter.
[ct=3375.702] There's been some guys rotating in.
[ct=3377.075] They're playing with some backups.
[ct=3378.323] Boy, they are climbing up to that second level
[ct=3379.662] to get into the face of those linebackers.
[ct=3387.666] Fields to the outside.
[ct=3388.999] Nothing happening there.
[ct=3390.328] Intended for Equanimeous St. Brown.
[ct=3394.284] First target of the night.
[ct=3398.277] Well, Luke Getsy is doing, again,
[ct=3400.256] a very good job of mixing up the looks
[ct=3402.913] and creating some frustration for Washington's defense,
[ct=3405.563] keeping the tight ends, from time to time, in to help out.
[ct=3409.543] That time, they did.
[ct=3410.839] Keep an extra tight end, with Marcedes Lewis
[ct=3412.194] off to the right there to affect the pass
[ct=3414.858] rush with Montez Sweat.
[ct=3416.193] So anything they can do to just try to make it look different.
[ct=3418.859] Keep the same play calls, but the presentation very
[ct=3422.819] different in this first half.
[ct=3429.454] High snap.
[ct=3432.105] Again, Herbert-- tough running.
[ct=3434.763] Close to a first.
[ct=3436.072] Khalil Herbert-- six carries, 53 yards for him.
[ct=3441.375] And you touched on it.
[ct=3442.760] Watch the right hand of Fields.
[ct=3444.032] Just a heck of an athletic play.
[ct=3445.375] Again, he's a baseball player, going back
[ct=3448.033] to his high school days.
[ct=3449.360] You see, Herbert had to hesitate.
[ct=3450.699] A lot of times, that disrupts the timing, and the play
[ct=3454.678] gets blown up.
[ct=3456.032] Good job by Herbert, waiting, and then there's
[ct=3458.663] that offensive line again, controlling things against one
[ct=3461.337] of the top fronts in the league.
[ct=3462.656] That's Whitehair again.
[ct=3463.948] Meanwhile, here we go again on a third and 1 with the push.
[ct=3470.646] Yep, one more time.
[ct=3478.763] It's like rugby, Australian rules football.
[ct=3482.751] I don't know what it is.
[ct=3484.015] Oh, man, yeah.
[ct=3485.363] Kmet and Herbert behind him.
[ct=3486.756] Herbert's 5' 9", 212, but 6' 6", 260?
[ct=3490.695] The quarterback's 230.
[ct=3492.014] Look at the black jerseys just flying in there,
[ct=3494.701] and there's nothing you can do.
[ct=3496.012] Nothing, except change the rule next year.
[ct=3499.973] Well, the way they've been going here, wouldn't be--
[ct=3503.967] into the backfield.
[ct=3505.299] Right now, an empty look.
[ct=3510.659] Fields under pressure, and nothing.
[ct=3514.608] Just has to keep it and eat it, and tackled
[ct=3518.590] to the line of scrimmage by Sweat and Young.
[ct=3521.260] This is what they like to do because of his run game,
[ct=3526.813] but watch how--
[ct=3528.198] going with Chase Young.
[ct=3529.427] The numbers are where they want it.
[ct=3530.766] Everybody's outside.
[ct=3532.109] But look at Chase Young, known as a pass-rusher,
[ct=3534.755] but a good job of anticipating.
[ct=3536.055] When the defensive front sees empty,
[ct=3537.442] they are alert to Justin Fields as a threat to run.
[ct=3542.761] It's up to them, with the numbers cleared out of there
[ct=3545.366] They've got to make plays like that.
[ct=3549.354] So four wide here.
[ct=3554.676] Caught, 19-yard line.
[ct=3556.034] Kmet-- he'll take it inside the 20.
[ct=3561.361] It'll be third down.
[ct=3563.963] A little over three minutes to go to the half,
[ct=3567.948] and this will be upcoming on this drive, the 12th play.
[ct=3574.596] Bears have run 33 plays, and Commanders just 16.
[ct=3585.244] Third and 4.
[ct=3587.877] They're 5 out of 7 on third down.
[ct=3603.863] It is Darnell Mooney.
[ct=3606.452] There's contact made.
[ct=3607.792] It'll be fourth down and no laundry.
[ct=3610.434] You got St-Juste covering on the play.
[ct=3613.168] Well, Mooney tries to use the big tight end, Kmet,
[ct=3617.117] to his outside.
[ct=3618.418] Uses him as a screen.
[ct=3619.740] Just tries to run behind him to affect the coverage,
[ct=3622.438] and it does.
[ct=3623.731] It does the job, but the ball's thrown a little bit late,
[ct=3626.365] and it allows St-Juste to be able to catch up to him
[ct=3630.373] and affect that throw.
[ct=3633.055] Terry's shaking his-- he's just shaking his head.
[ct=3635.686] Terry, what are you shaking your head for?
[ct=3638.339] Sure looked like it was early contact, not playing the ball,
[ct=3642.322] Sure did.
[ct=3643.658] 36-yard attempt here by Cairo Santos is good.
[ct=3647.889] 2:24 to the half.
[ct=3651.859] Chicago extends its lead to 20 to 3.
[ct=3662.470] This is not the first all-electric car.
[ct=3665.172] That's because no BMW sees the road until it's
[ct=3667.810] reached the ultimate standard, our own,
[ct=3670.447] a standard that demands that every BMW drives and feels
[ct=3674.437] exactly like a BMW should--
[ct=3675.763] unparalleled performance and precision handling,
[ct=3678.431] made possible by electric engineering.
[ct=3681.113] But isn't that what you'd expect from the ultimate electric
[ct=3685.081] driving machine?
[ct=3686.380] Hurry in and lease the 2024 BMW iX xDriv50 for 7--
[ct=3690.373] (SINGING) Private jetting in the night sky, my man
[ct=3693.073] hand-glide by with my fried rice.
[ct=3695.694] What could you not love about a slice
[ct=3698.336] G-R-U-B-H-U-B. Did somebody say GrubHub?
[ct=3704.996] Geico makes car insurance easy-- as easy as getting personal
[ct=3708.989] Got a new play for you, the 220 Pancake Block
[ct=3711.644] You Can't Bench 350 Super Sweep.
[ct=3714.286] But I can bench 350.
[ct=3715.652] OK, I have a play name, then.
[ct=3716.965] It's called "double pump fake, I'm stronger than you,
[ct=3719.611] I can bench 350, and I'm a good tackle."
[ct=3722.244] That's not a play name.
[ct=3723.577] With coverage for your whole lineup in the app,
[ct=3726.223] What about "red zone 120, I'm good at football,
[ct=3728.916] I'm a good football analyst, and I open
[ct=3730.233] the lane better than anybody.
[ct=3731.550] I go block, block, block, block, block, block.
[ct=3734.245] I block them there."
[ct=3735.549] [ring tone music]
[ct=3736.830] (SINGING) Ch-ch-champion.
[ct=3738.204] Travis Kelce is a champion twice.
[ct=3739.562] Dude, my new ringtone.
[ct=3742.178] Travis, zip it.
[ct=3743.553] It's your year, big guy.

[ct=3789.999] Binge all the action tonight only on Prime Video.
[ct=3796.626] So there's your new owner of the Washington Commanders,
[ct=3803.465] Josh Harris.
[ct=3804.806] Had a chance to meet him, and Kirk and I visited with him
[ct=3808.442] before the game.
[ct=3809.273] Also owns the Philadelphia 76ers.
[ct=3812.001] Owns the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League,
[ct=3814.910] so he's got hockey starting up.
[ct=3818.295] Dealing with James Harden and the 76ers,
[ct=3820.931] trying to build a new arena there,
[ct=3822.609] trying to build a new stadium here .
[ct=3828.566] Not much, but this town is ecstatic.
[ct=3837.950] I've been coming here for about 38 years, doing the NFL.
[ct=3840.018] And over the last 24, especially over the last 15,
[ct=3846.212] this was not a happy fan base, but they are thrilled.
[ct=3850.235] And Dan Snyder was here for 24 years.
[ct=3851.708] Had some early success, but not much over the course
[ct=3854.338] of a quarter century.
[ct=3855.834] And boy, they were just looking for anybody to come in.
[ct=3858.293] Only cost them was 6 billion clams.
[ct=3860.455] [laughs] Right, exactly.
[ct=3862.863] But you know what was cool is just
[ct=3863.203] to hear from the players, too, and the coaches.
[ct=3866.873] There's a real appreciation for the energy
[ct=3868.593] that he's brought in.
[ct=3870.075] And they said anything that they--
[ct=3870.679] he's like, well, how can I help?
[ct=3872.748] What do you need?
[ct=3872.852] Ron Rivera's communicated with him pretty openly,
[ct=3877.054] so you're right.
[ct=3877.160] Different energy.
[ct=3878.818] Howell throws.
[ct=3878.939] This is going to be picked off.
[ct=3881.474] Greg Stroman intercepting it on the pass right over the middle,
[ct=3887.673] and the defense goes down to celebrate
[ct=3890.263] as Howell throws the pick here, and Chicago's back in business
[ct=3894.261] Here's the matchup right here.
[ct=3895.733] But what I want you to watch is Howell works from his left,
[ct=3899.585] back to his right, and by then he's late.
[ct=3903.137] This is, again, the area that he's
[ct=3904.330] trying to work and understand, is
[ct=3906.640] the timing of his progressions.
[ct=3907.924] And as a young guy, it just takes time.
[ct=3909.062] It's examples like this of learning through this.
[ct=3912.382] Heck of a play, by the way, by the backup nickel Greg
[ct=3915.808] Stroman, who's been out most of his career
[ct=3917.641] with a lot of injuries.
[ct=3918.959] I think he had 73 snaps in the last four years
[ct=3922.213] until the injury this year to Kyler Gordon has given him
[ct=3925.585] a chance to step up.
[ct=3928.141] So he's been injured.
[ct=3928.522] He's been on practice squads--
[ct=3930.298] Washington, Buffalo, the Rams.
[ct=3931.610] Chicago now, and takes advantage of his opportunity with Gordon
[ct=3935.300] down and makes a heck of a play.
[ct=3939.801] From the 36-yard line.
[ct=3945.085] Has that knocked down.
[ct=3946.487] That time, it's Chase Young knocking it down with 2:15.
[ct=3953.579] Bears have two timeouts if they need them,
[ct=3956.329] I had a chance to see Chase on the field before the game,
[ct=3959.620] just asking him how he's feeling the last few weeks.
[ct=3962.272] Looks like he's gradually getting back to 100%
[ct=3964.606] coming off the ACL from a couple of years ago,
[ct=3967.901] and he said, watch tonight.
[ct=3968.010] He's like, this is the first time I really feel good.
[ct=3971.451] And if you've watched him, I know
[ct=3973.300] it's not a great night so far for the Commanders,
[ct=3976.045] but 99 is moving around the way you expect him to.
[ct=3980.607] [chuckles] Herbert.
[ct=3988.553] Takes a bunch to bring him down.
[ct=3992.191] Third down, 7 as we approach the two-minute warning.
[ct=3997.618] This is the two-minute warning.
[ct=3998.948] Two timeouts remaining.
[ct=3999.656] It'll be third down and 7 for Chicago when we come back.
[ct=4003.705] 20 to 3, Bears.
[ct=4013.541] [playing guitar]
[ct=4014.206] (SINGING) Tacos, tacos, tacos.
[ct=4018.323] Tacos, tacos, or some pizza, wings, or some other food
[ct=4027.079] that rhymes with pizza.
[ct=4028.916] It all goes great with football unless you
[ct=4033.932] rhymed something really weird with pizza, like fashionista.

[ct=4085.972] [screaming]
[ct=4090.518] Now that's a high-quality tackle.
[ct=4091.814] Let's run that back, JJ.
[ct=4092.670] [distorted screaming]
[ct=4095.455] I love tacos very much, and now you know that.

[ct=4111.084] features the Bills, whose Week 4 victory was highlighted
[ct=4114.451] in part by Stefon Diggs.
[ct=4115.433] Diggs caught a pass from quarterback Josh Allen,
[ct=4117.878] evaded tackles from Dolphins defenders Kader Kohou
[ct=4120.460] and Brandon Jones, and sprinted to the end zone,
[ct=4123.373] increasing the Bills' lead en route to a 48-to-20 victory.
[ct=4128.563] Inspire greatness.
[ct=4133.595] There they are, with apologies to the Michigan basketball
[ct=4136.722] team, the Fab Five.
[ct=4139.150] Charissa has rounded up the troops.
[ct=4142.655] Can't wait to hear these guys weigh in.
[ct=4145.199] On a night when you thought, Chicago's
[ct=4147.884] coming in, are they dead, or whatever, it's all Chicago,
[ct=4151.607] 20 to 3.
[ct=4152.637] State Farm halftime show coming up in a couple of minutes,
[ct=4158.807] plus.
[ct=4160.151] From the 33-yard line on third down and 7,
[ct=4163.013] Herbert fights his way inside the 25.
[ct=4166.969] Look at this.
[ct=4168.897] Cody Whitehair leading the way.
[ct=4172.205] So Moore's having a fabulous night.
[ct=4173.506] Meanwhile, here's Herbert-- eight carries, 72 yards.
[ct=4177.492] That's 9 yards a carry.
[ct=4178.802] But watch Whitehair and also the right guard, Nate Davis.
[ct=4182.859] Both of them able to climb up to that second level.
[ct=4186.660] No interior defensive lineman.
[ct=4188.594] Made it very easy for that interior
[ct=4190.164] to be able to get up and impact, again, those linebackers.
[ct=4194.016] There's just no one there.
[ct=4198.550] From the 17.
[ct=4209.210] Herbert again, behind Blasingame.
[ct=4211.403] To the outside he goes.
[ct=4214.364] And every run's a tough run for him.
[ct=4216.171] Khalil Herbert-- third year out of Virginia Tech,
[ct=4219.625] a sixth-round pick in '21.
[ct=4223.226] He's averaging almost 9 yards a carry tonight.
[ct=4225.513] And if the Bears get this going with the way they
[ct=4228.034] like their structure of their offense,
[ct=4229.813] with Fields as a threat off play action
[ct=4232.452] and him being able to run on the outside, it's a game-changer.
[ct=4235.923] It's what Luke Getsy--
[ct=4237.297] anybody wants the run game, but especially
[ct=4240.028] this system and their quarterback.
[ct=4245.512] He's now in Detroit.
[ct=4247.531] Saw him last week.
[ct=4249.231] And Herbert's now the man.
[ct=4251.600] Go five wide here.
[ct=4252.347] Fields hanging in, rolling away.
[ct=4255.030] Fields, looking for the first down,
[ct=4256.357] gets it and slides to a stop inside the 5.
[ct=4259.698] The official, for the moment, looked
[ct=4260.967] like he was going to reach for the flag, but did not.
[ct=4265.262] That's Darrick Forrest right there.
[ct=4267.708] Al, two no-nos.
[ct=4269.248] Lose the edge, man-to-man coverage on the back end,
[ct=4273.447] and against an athletic quarterback.
[ct=4275.962] If you lose the edge with Chase Young,
[ct=4277.695] there's no one left there to account
[ct=4280.289] for the most dangerous weapon the Bears have,
[ct=4283.438] and that's Justin Fields.
[ct=4284.791] I think the official, so far, is trying to get out of the way,
[ct=4288.119] First down and goal.
[ct=4292.189] Fields again, over the middle.
[ct=4294.590] Caught, Kmet!
[ct=4295.878] Touchdown.
[ct=4301.867] Cole Kmet.
[ct=4303.373] Third in two weeks, and the Commanders fans are going,
[ct=4308.210] what is going on?
[ct=4312.089] I think they are frustrated.
[ct=4313.650] And I think the Bears came into this game pretty confident
[ct=4317.340] that they could attack the backers in coverage.
[ct=4321.234] And here's the big tight end right
[ct=4322.188] here, going up against the middle linebacker, Cody Barton.
[ct=4325.581] It's a mismatch.
[ct=4326.910] He gets separation.
[ct=4328.826] Even if he doesn't get separation,
[ct=4330.138] it's an advantage, at 6' 6".
[ct=4332.425] But he shows you.
[ct=4333.947] He flexed him out.
[ct=4335.391] He is a threat out there on the perimeter.
[ct=4338.314] Santos, extra point.
[ct=4341.080] And if you're just tuning in, that is not a typo.
[ct=4346.577] 27 to 3, Bears.
[ct=4355.363] People are excited about what AI will do for them.
[ct=4358.248] We're excited about what AI will do for business.
[ct=4360.975] Introducing watsonx, a platform designed to multiply output
[ct=4366.441] by training AI with your data.
[ct=4367.900] When you watsonx your business, you
[ct=4369.211] can build AI to help coders code faster,
[ct=4372.871] customer service respond quicker,
[ct=4374.269] and employees handle repetitive tasks in less time.
[ct=4377.890] Let's create AI that transforms business with watsonx.
[ct=4384.811] Hi, mom.
[ct=4384.936] Kelly, Rita, and I just went on our Carnival Cruise.
[ct=4387.562] Hey, look, that's me there in the middle.
[ct=4389.822] And we just really found ourselves, you know?
[ct=4393.645] I got over my fear of bubbles.
[ct=4396.101] Rita took some time to reflect.
[ct=4397.496] We tried new things and new foods.
[ct=4400.030] Kelly's thinking about getting piano lessons.
[ct=4402.679] It's a good song.
[ct=4404.054] And I'm getting really good at golf.
[ct=4406.792] Anyways, next year we should all go together.
[ct=4411.853] [foghorn fanfare]
[ct=4413.188] Choose fun!
[ct=4414.702] [coughs]
[ct=4415.936] Honey.
[ct=4417.971] Honey?
[ct=4418.531] NyQuil Severe Honey, powerful cold and flu relief
[ct=4421.961] with a dreamy honey taste.
[ct=4423.400] NyQuil Honey, the nighttime, sniffling, sneezing, coughing,
[ct=4426.179] aching, fever, honeylicious, "best
[ct=4427.627] sleep with a cold" medicine.
[ct=4429.251] The Three for Me, only at Chili's, serves up
[ct=4431.776] bottomless drinks, bottomless chips and salsa,
[ct=4433.872] and a cheeseburger and fries for just $10.99.
[ct=4436.955] Hey, it's three for me, not three for us.
[ct=4439.642] This Chili's Three for Me is the--
[ct=4448.953] You look at Matt Eberflus.
[ct=4450.257] Here's a guy-- his team hasn't won a game in almost a year.
[ct=4452.582] They beat New England Week 7 last year.
[ct=4455.286] 3 and 18 is his record over a year and a quarter.
[ct=4461.515] He's been getting killed, obviously, in the press,
[ct=4464.486] in the media, and all that stuff,
[ct=4466.973] and obviously by social media as well, as usual.
[ct=4471.151] And there's even some stories out today about
[ct=4473.836] will he get fired after the game, with 10 days
[ct=4477.772] till the next game?
[ct=4477.819] Well, there's a lot of release of emotion right now.
[ct=4481.854] It's almost been a year since they won a football game.
[ct=4483.212] They're up 27 to 3.
[ct=4484.475] Of course, they had a big lead at half.
[ct=4485.466] That'll be, I'm sure, his speech at halftime.
[ct=4488.171] They were up big on Denver and ended up losing.
[ct=4489.365] But it just looks like a team that's
[ct=4492.665] ticked off and tired of it, you know what I mean?
[ct=4494.014] They're playing with a lot of emotion tonight.
[ct=4496.665] I'll tell you, the seat doesn't get any hotter
[ct=4498.887] than what he and Justin Fields are dealing with in Chicago,
[ct=4501.660] having lost 14 straight, and they're
[ct=4504.190] trying to put in, staying positive,
[ct=4506.800] and they're trying to get through the storm,
[ct=4508.601] saying the right thing.
[ct=4509.916] But you know it's eating them up,
[ct=4511.328] and this first half's been great for them.
[ct=4513.516] No doubt.
[ct=4514.622] The numbers are astonishing--
[ct=4516.010] 307 yards for Chicago, 49 for Washington.
[ct=4519.760] That is a 6-to-1 ratio.
[ct=4523.745] And he has to throw that away.
[ct=4525.227] And that Bear defense, which has obviously had a meltdown
[ct=4529.244] in the second half-- and this is a team that gives up,
[ct=4532.058] as I mentioned, 29 points per game,
[ct=4533.508] the worst in the league over the last two years--
[ct=4536.263] allowing 49 yards on 18 plays.
[ct=4541.152] It's unbelievable.
[ct=4542.550] The biggest Bears fan couldn't have expected this.
[ct=4546.164] This defense has not been able to win the line of scrimmage
[ct=4548.706] all year.
[ct=4549.952] They've not been able to apply pressure.
[ct=4551.334] You just saw Gervon Dexter come in, 99, as a rookie.
[ct=4556.066] Stroman had that interception.
[ct=4557.551] He started his career here.
[ct=4560.084] And that pass is caught, but nothing really happening
[ct=4562.714] after that.
[ct=4565.406] Even that time, rushing four, DeMarcus Walker-- he
[ct=4567.769] gets home and affects the quarterback.
[ct=4571.386] It's almost like they're putting it all into this first half.
[ct=4574.828] Shows you the potential of what this defense can
[ct=4577.852] do despite being down Eddie Jackson,
[ct=4580.391] Juwan Johnson, Kyler Gordon.
[ct=4583.192] You're missing three guys in the back end,
[ct=4585.810] but they have shown up with something to prove tonight.
[ct=4599.058] It'll be caught here.
[ct=4600.176] At least Antonio Gibson gets the first down.
[ct=4606.382] Meanwhile--
[ct=4607.887] First charged timeout.
[ct=4608.886] --one, they're going to take a timeout.
[ct=4612.144] [scattered booing]
[ct=4614.628] Even the crowd doesn't like the timeout.
[ct=4617.365] They're going, really?
[ct=4618.757] You're going to go 64 yards here in three seconds?
[ct=4622.724] Maybe you get a pass-interference penalty,
[ct=4625.445] Who knows?
[ct=4631.256] Ron Rivera hasn't had too many games like this in his career.
[ct=4637.626] This is a skunky to this point.
[ct=4641.624] 14 first downs to 4.
[ct=4644.411] Eberflus says, get all the way back there.
[ct=4646.535] Get all the way back.
[ct=4647.825] 40, 50 yards back.
[ct=4649.765] Get back over there in Bethesda.
[ct=4655.427] Final play of the half, barring a defensive foul.
[ct=4662.504] That'll pick up some meaningless yardage.
[ct=4665.445] [booing]
[ct=4666.628] And the crowd says it all.
[ct=4677.512] 27 to 3.
[ct=4681.573] Down to you, Kaylee.
[ct=4683.052] Coach, it seems like everything is working for your offense.
[ct=4686.064] Why?
[ct=4687.438] Really working hard on detail, and that's been coming.
[ct=4689.962] We saw it last week, a glimpse of that last week,
[ct=4692.900] and we're seeing it tonight.
[ct=4693.955] And we just got to finish the game the right way.
[ct=4698.084] You know no lead is safe.
[ct=4699.128] What will you tell your team at the half?
[ct=4700.816] Yeah, it's 0-0 to us.
[ct=4702.304] I know that's coach talk, but that's
[ct=4704.990] what we're going to tell them.
[ct=4705.147] And we got to focus, and we got to finish.
[ct=4707.563] Thanks, Coach.
[ct=4708.515] All right, thanks.
[ct=4710.801] Pretty much an astonishing first half.
[ct=4717.865] State Farm halftime show coming up after the break.
[ct=4725.028] We are at war.
[ct=4727.962] Captain Marvel, we need you to save the world.
[ct=4737.482] They took everything from me.
[ct=4740.245] So want to fight?
[ct=4744.985] You cannot protect your people.
[ct=4749.581] Watch me.
[ct=4750.887] The Marvels, rated PG-13, in theaters November 10.
[ct=4753.561] Tickets on sale Tuesday.
[ct=4754.917] Cam!
[ct=4755.056] How'd you spend the offseason?
[ct=4757.639] Hmm.
[ct=4759.461] Picnic!
[ct=4760.726] Sleepover!
[ct=4761.961] Movie night!
[ct=4763.386] Best offseason ever!
[ct=4764.793] Just hit the weights.
[ct=4766.261] Try the new 4-Quarter Calzony.
[ct=4767.199] It's officially delicious.
[ct=4769.708] One down, nine to go.
[ct=4771.121] Hey, what are you doing out here?
[ct=4772.024] I just had something picked up.
[ct=4773.173] Oh my gosh, I'm having something delivered.
[ct=4775.823] Carvana?
[ct=4776.016] You know Carvana?
[ct=4777.211] Bought it, scheduled it, [gasps] and here it is!
[ct=4779.296] You think Carvana's is good for buying?
[ct=4781.087] You should try selling one.
[ct=4782.483] Buy--
[ct=4782.822] Or sell.
[ct=4783.324] --your car.
[ct=4784.761] [vocalizing]
[ct=4786.473] (SINGING) Zoom in close, and I might strike a pose.
[ct=4789.196] I'm in my zone, but I'm sure that you know.
[ct=4792.049] It ain't my fault.
[ct=4793.227] [wind]
[ct=4794.688] (SINGING) It's in my wall.
[ct=4795.096] Run it like it feel great.
[ct=4795.995] Hit them with a freeze frame.
[ct=4797.310] I've been thinking about it.
[ct=4800.524] Will marry me?
[ct=4801.811] [screams]
[ct=4803.200] (SINGING) Zoom, zoom, zoom.
[ct=4805.829] Zoom in on me.
[ct=4806.725] Zoom, zoom, zoom.
[ct=4810.360] That girl can't get me.
[ct=4810.876] Room, room, room.
[ct=4812.868] I become one with the camera, focused.
[ct=4815.705] Snapshot costs like a million, golden.
[ct=4816.986] Flex so you know all my angles, easy.
[ct=4819.855] Move to the front.
[ct=4819.997] Make sure they can see me.
[ct=4822.588] [gasps] Wow.
[ct=4823.936] (SINGING) Zoom, zoom--
[ct=4826.348] (SINGING) Zoom in on me.
[ct=4830.368] Back up and give me.
[ct=4832.378] Oh!
[ct=4832.716] [excited laughter]
[ct=4834.997] [music continues]
[ct=4845.101] Sunday Morning Football is back on NFL Network with
[ct=4849.158] the must-see showdown from across the pond--
[ct=4852.773] --as Trevor Lawrence and the Jags--
[ct=4854.783] Making people miss.
[ct=4856.061] --take on Josh Allen and the Bills--
[ct=4857.413] End zone, touchdown!
[ct=4858.047] --live from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London.
[ct=4861.414] It's a special moment.
[ct=4862.912] He's got it!
[ct=4863.453] Shine.
[ct=4863.855] What a tie!
[ct=4865.198] And watch a full day of football.
[ct=4867.870] (SINGING) Hail the king.
[ct=4870.487] Sunday at 9:30 on NFL Network and NFL Plus.
[ct=4882.288] Welcome to the State Farm halftime show, and what
[ct=4885.010] a first 30 minutes from Chicago.
[ct=4886.891] They did not look like the team that
[ct=4888.216] has lost 14 straight games, as they lead the Commanders
[ct=4892.432] at the half, 27 to 3.
[ct=4894.507] Welcome in, everyone.
[ct=4895.906] I'm Charissa Thompson, alongside Tony Gonzalez,
[ct=4897.246] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Andrew Whitworth, and Richard Sherman.
[ct=4901.661] This offense is clicking on all cylinders.
[ct=4904.363] DJ Moore-- a big first half.
[ct=4904.773] What do you like so far out of the Bears?
[ct=4906.888] DJ Moore is absolutely having himself a game.
[ct=4908.400] AJ Brown, last week against this defense,
[ct=4911.001] had 175 yards, two touchdowns.
[ct=4912.480] DJ Moore said, I saw something on film,
[ct=4915.148] and I can do that, too.
[ct=4916.591] And it starts in three phases.
[ct=4917.958] First phase, right here, he gets the ball in his hands.
[ct=4919.468] Run after catch.
[ct=4920.623] Got to have this, as a receiver.
[ct=4922.039] You look at him get up the sideline
[ct=4923.445] right here with some nice, nifty moves,
[ct=4924.744] and they finally push him out of bounds.
[ct=4926.094] Then, here, it's savviness, finding that spot in the zone.
[ct=4929.989] See, he doesn't run full speed.
[ct=4931.413] Slow-choke it, and sit there, and score that touchdown.
[ct=4934.754] Then, right here, it's a double move.
[ct=4936.000] Uh-oh, bite on it, and then a great throw by Justin Fields.
[ct=4939.283] Justin Fields is playing some outstanding football.
[ct=4940.837] This whole Bears team-- they've got more energy.
[ct=4943.751] They're firing off the ball.
[ct=4944.883] They look like a really solid football team right now.
[ct=4947.693] They heard Whit's pregame speech.
[ct=4949.048] That's it, baby.
[ct=4949.223] Must have.
[ct=4950.518] They really do, and Justin Fields looks comfortable.
[ct=4952.816] You can tell.
[ct=4953.288] And what I said before the game-- in his footwork,
[ct=4955.588] you can tell the certainty that he has in his mind.
[ct=4958.391] So we're not seeing those lazy "hop back there" drops.
[ct=4961.140] This one right here was great because it just slows down
[ct=4964.316] that pass rush.
[ct=4965.067] Here we go, whipping it like a shortstop.
[ct=4967.842] And then, right here, that's certainty.
[ct=4969.232] That's having your feet in the ground,
[ct=4970.608] and he's delivering the football with a purpose.
[ct=4973.354] It's been really impressive to see.
[ct=4975.811] We really started to see it last week.
[ct=4979.992] The way that they've worked together,
[ct=4982.378] some of the things that Justin Fields said--
[ct=4983.977] this is really important for him to come out and play well
[ct=4987.031] for his coach, and he's doing it right now.
[ct=4988.557] We talked about it in the pregame.
[ct=4990.047] Washington's defense has given up
[ct=4990.494] at least 33 points in each of the last three games
[ct=4993.883] they played.
[ct=4995.066] So Sherm, take us through the Highlight Bundle,
[ct=4997.831] presented by State Farm, and what they're not doing well.
[ct=5000.394] I'm sure Jack Del Rio is incensed
[ct=5001.712] right now because his secondary is just not
[ct=5004.811] You see, right here, this is one-on-one coverage,
[ct=5006.876] man-to-man.
[ct=5008.207] He takes the inside release, then he gets up the field.
[ct=5009.623] Where's the safety?
[ct=5011.084] This is their number one receiver.
[ct=5011.506] You should have eyes on him at all times.
[ct=5013.725] But you can deal with that.
[ct=5015.136] But this you cannot deal with.
[ct=5016.472] Cover-2 safety with his back turned to the number one
[ct=5018.902] receiver, wide open.
[ct=5020.319] No help, no cover to the defense--
[ct=5023.018] that's unacceptable football.
[ct=5024.415] Here, another man-to-man stand-up route.
[ct=5027.101] Kendall Fuller decided to play the front pylon.
[ct=5029.915] They threw it to the back pylon.
[ct=5031.210] That's a mistake you can't make as a veteran corner.
[ct=5034.102] It started to frustrate me.
[ct=5035.070] I started stretching a little bit,
[ct=5036.761] because if they're playing this bad,
[ct=5038.245] I'm going to go out there in tennis shoes
[ct=5039.573] and get the job done if they're going to play like this.
[ct=5041.409] Come on, give me a few dollars.
[ct=5042.683] I'll get it done.
[ct=5043.908] Well, I'm going to tell you, Ron Rivera at halftime, I'm sure,
[ct=5045.306] is reminding his team that this is a Chicago Bears
[ct=5047.656] team that gave up a 21-point lead last week to the Broncos.
[ct=5051.287] End up losing.
[ct=5051.433] So if you're the Commanders, how do you
[ct=5052.737] get back in this thing, Whit?
[ct=5053.440] Well, I think you look at what the Broncos were able to do.
[ct=5055.528] They finally started getting the football down the field
[ct=5058.434] in the second half.
[ct=5058.826] Had some big explosive plays, and you
[ct=5061.123] got to slow this Bears offense down.
[ct=5062.358] But Justin Fields and them looked hot.
[ct=5063.861] I think, really, you look on that side of the football.
[ct=5065.446] Can Justin Fields and the Bears offense continue to run it?
[ct=5069.325] Because with a lead in these kind of games,
[ct=5071.453] you got to be able to convert, move the chains,
[ct=5074.172] and keep that clock moving, and get your own plays when
[ct=5077.029] Right, but the complaint last week with the Bears
[ct=5079.579] was they got too conservative.
[ct=5080.964] They took the ball out of Justin Fields' hands.
[ct=5082.446] So keep your foot on the gas, and keep
[ct=5085.201] going if you're Luke Getsy and Justin Fields.
[ct=5086.591] And you heard him say that to Kaylee at halftime.
[ct=5088.533] Sympathy is pouring in from around the football world
[ct=5093.084] and the NFL community as we remember the life and legacy
[ct=5095.957] of Pro Football Hall of Famer and Chicago Bear legend Dick
[ct=5100.257] Butkus, who passed away at the age of 80.
[ct=5114.233] some said, keep dreaming.
[ct=5119.377] Now we're working on an EV that has wings,
[ct=5123.644] and someday we'll turn your old Honda
[ct=5125.672] into your brand-new Honda, because we
[ct=5129.527] are a company of dreamers setting out
[ct=5131.811] to be carbon-neutral by 2050.
[ct=5141.089] Uh, I don't know, Jake from State Farm.
[ct=5143.099] But just imagine, Mahomes and MaAuto.
[ct=5147.541] Best bundle in the league, baby.
[ct=5149.184] Man, why can't Patrick change his name?
[ct=5150.705] It could be Kelce and "Kelce how much you can save
[ct=5153.334] by bundling home and auto."
[ct=5158.230] You make the letters smaller.
[ct=5163.365] Put your jersey on.
[ct=5165.033] Come on!
[ct=5166.547] --just another way to save with the Personal Price Plan.
[ct=5174.646] Next week, we're heading to Kansas City for Broncos-Chiefs.
[ct=5177.541] We don't know if Taylor Swift will be there,
[ct=5180.389] but we do TNF in the Shop will be part of the action.
[ct=5182.642] Here are LeBron, Mav, and Paul Rivera to tell you
[ct=5186.876] what to expect.
[ct=5187.774] We're back!
[ct=5190.573] Thursday Night Football in the Shop.
[ct=5192.056] [laughter, applause]
[ct=5194.972] Shout-out to Al Michaels, Kirk Herbstreit, and Amazon Prime
[ct=5199.697] for having us back.
[ct=5199.911] Thank you.
[ct=5200.538] October 12, we'll see you--
[ct=5201.864] KC and the Broncos.
[ct=5204.700] Anytime you say KC, the first thing you think about
[ct=5207.654] is Pat Mahomes, of course.
[ct=5208.907] You add Travis Kelce.
[ct=5210.320] You add the big guy calling the shots,
[ct=5211.793] and it's an Arrowhead, too, one of the craziest environments
[ct=5214.998] to play in.
[ct=5216.024] So what we got from the Broncos, though?
[ct=5217.106] You've got to find out if Russ and Sean are going to work out.
[ct=5219.720] We're going to talk about in the shop.
[ct=5222.031] You never know who's going to stop by.
[ct=5223.096] By the way, Travis, you still owe us an appearance.
[ct=5225.421] We talked about this.
[ct=5226.510] Facts.
[ct=5227.720] We'll see you on a bye week or the offseason
[ct=5229.185] after you win another Super Bowl.
[ct=5230.719] But in the meantime, we will see you October 12
[ct=5232.798] on Amazon Prime in the shop.
[ct=5235.153] Yes, sir.
[ct=5239.302] I tell you what, I'm glad we get the Shop back, huh?
[ct=5241.369] We got them.
[ct=5242.772] We got Magic Johnson.
[ct=5244.364] But I can't wait to get back out to Kansas City,
[ct=5246.619] see how they keep evolving as a team.
[ct=5248.098] I do not think they've played their best football yet.
[ct=5251.023] Going against the Broncos, going to be a great game.
[ct=5252.807] Russell Wilson played pretty well last week,
[ct=5255.433] It's going to be a good matchup.
[ct=5257.020] Yeah, Kansas City has won 15 straight against the Broncos.
[ct=5259.000] Meanwhile, the Chicago Bears looking to get their first
[ct=5263.396] win in almost a year.
[ct=5264.918] And who's happy about this halftime score?
[ct=5266.722] Lil Durk.
[ct=5267.706] Coming up after TNF Nightcap, we'll
[ct=5269.974] be taking the stage in Los Angeles
[ct=5271.562] and performing tracks from his current smash album, Almost
[ct=5275.644] Amazon Music Live, when the game ends and the music begins.
[ct=5280.164] And there were plenty of questions for the Bears
[ct=5281.551] after Sunday's loss, and they've answered them so far
[ct=5285.283] on both sides of the ball.
[ct=5285.438] Chicago leading this one 27 to 3 at the half.
[ct=5289.658] This has been the State Farm halftime show.
[ct=5291.331] The second half is next.
[ct=5292.532] We will see you postgame.
[ct=5306.247] You think life is short?
[ct=5306.753] Football is short.
[ct=5307.802] The regular season's just 18 weeks, just three days a week,

[ct=5402.946] The Chicago Bears-- everything working perfectly
[ct=5407.908] in the first half.
[ct=5409.428] You have Justin Fields, big half.
[ct=5410.952] Threw for 189 yards, three touchdowns.
[ct=5413.853] 27 to 3 is our score.
[ct=5417.391] Again, a tremendous first half for Chicago.
[ct=5423.421] He's done it now in consecutive games.
[ct=5424.332] Did it against Denver last week in the first half
[ct=5428.509] with three TD passes.
[ct=5431.765] They've been tough on the ground and in the air, and of course,
[ct=5434.644] a tremendous start tonight.
[ct=5436.991] DJ Moore, 124--
[ct=5439.549] 125 receiving yards for the TD in three consecutive games.
[ct=5444.798] 307 total yards in the first half.
[ct=5446.270] So I mean, every number, you can look anywhere you want.
[ct=5450.359] 14 to 5 in first downs.
[ct=5451.850] 307 to 84 in yardage, and some of that 84 came at the end
[ct=5457.288] and didn't mean anything in the first half.
[ct=5458.719] Yeah, pretty much every stat you can look at
[ct=5460.385] is different from what we expected when we drove up
[ct=5465.099] I mean, everything is contrary to what most people expected
[ct=5469.660] to see in this first half, but if you're Matt Eberflus,
[ct=5472.748] it's pretty easy to rallying call.
[ct=5474.210] Just remember last week, 21 to 7 at half.
[ct=5477.412] Got it all the way up to 28 to 7 on Denver
[ct=5480.354] and ended up losing the game.
[ct=5481.898] Right, 31-28.
[ct=5484.023] All right, we start with the touchback here.
[ct=5485.375] Washington at the 25 yard line, but first, to Kaylee.
[ct=5489.945] Coach, how do you contain the Bears offense?
[ct=5493.088] Well, we got 30 minutes.
[ct=5494.590] We'll find out.
[ct=5494.907] We got to find that [muted] out on the field.
[ct=5497.214] It's got to be the guys that go out
[ct=5498.343] and step up and play some football.
[ct=5500.438] What did you say to try to rally your guys during the half?
[ct=5504.555] My guys have got to do to the guys are going to go out
[ct=5507.443] on the field, so those--
[ct=5508.395] they talked about.
[ct=5510.479] They talked about doing it for each other
[ct=5511.993] more so than anything else.
[ct=5513.465] Thank you, coach.
[ct=5515.273] Direct.
[ct=5518.008] For sure.
[ct=5520.136] To the 25.
[ct=5522.940] Pass, Robinson makes the grab.
[ct=5523.828] Robinson is able to slide away from contact,
[ct=5529.213] and it's a good beginning for Washington
[ct=5530.000] to start the third quarter as he takes it
[ct=5532.824] to midfield, gain of 24 yards.
[ct=5537.591] Screens have hurt this defense all year long,
[ct=5539.314] and the timing of this is pretty good by Sam Howell.
[ct=5542.027] He looks left, kind of shows he's
[ct=5543.626] going to go to the man in motion, then comes back.
[ct=5546.109] Gets rid of it just in time and picks up some good blocks
[ct=5550.033] downfield.
[ct=5552.559] I'm surprised they're not going a little faster
[ct=5553.920] with a little bit of tempo just because Sam Howell looked
[ct=5557.540] so good last week against Philly late in that game in that
[ct=5560.571] two minute drill when he's playing with a little bit
[ct=5562.849] more urgency.
[ct=5569.163] Play-action.
[ct=5570.675] Good protection.
[ct=5572.159] That's caught.
[ct=5574.343] Gain of about six, Brian Robinson making the grab again.
[ct=5579.304] Call it a seven yard pickup, second down
[ct=5581.861] and 3 for the Commanders.
[ct=5585.020] Now, you go back to the beginning
[ct=5585.436] of this game, the plan that Ron Rivera and his staff
[ct=5589.154] came up with, with Eric Bieniemy,
[ct=5590.578] was being patient, knowing that the Bears are going to sit back
[ct=5595.034] without those three defensive backs,
[ct=5596.524] They thought they'd get a lot of zone,
[ct=5598.058] and it's just taking their time and being patient.
[ct=5601.928] Much tougher to do down 24 in the second half.
[ct=5606.338] That pass is caught for a first down,
[ct=5608.593] and then shoved out of bounds.
[ct=5611.397] That's Logan Thomas shoved out by Stevenson, so another first
[ct=5615.698] down for Washington.
[ct=5617.321] Right away, Eric Bieniemy attacking the softer coverage.
[ct=5620.116] If you're going to get easy throws to pick up first downs,
[ct=5623.187] you take it.
[ct=5624.693] This second half could come down to their ability
[ct=5627.553] You're going to move the ball between the 20s.
[ct=5630.031] What are you going to do when you get down in the red zone,
[ct=5632.903] and those windows get tighter?
[ct=5634.393] They got great length at linebacker
[ct=5636.008] with Tremaine Edmunds and DJ Edwards.
[ct=5639.043] That red zone's has been foreign territory for these guys
[ct=5642.056] to this point.
[ct=5644.322] From the 39 on first down.
[ct=5648.709] Getting round here to Gibson, and they picked up
[ct=5652.583] three first downs on the first four plays
[ct=5656.175] of the third quarter.
[ct=5656.755] Remember we talked about what Chicago's doing?
[ct=5659.279] They don't want to give up that easy, easy score.
[ct=5661.615] They don't want to give up anything downfield,
[ct=5663.640] so they're just sinking in coverage.
[ct=5665.423] And Howell knows that, and Eric Bieniemy talked to him
[ct=5669.026] about that at halftime.
[ct=5670.460] And you get the ball out to an athlete
[ct=5672.035] like Gibson, who's a former receiver in college,
[ct=5673.834] and has done it up at this level.
[ct=5676.494] Pick up again, positive yards.
[ct=5678.065] I'm telling you, it's going to come down to that red zone.
[ct=5680.751] You're going to move the ball.
[ct=5682.861] Picked up 48 yards on the first four plays on this drive.
[ct=5689.660] From the 27 now, blitz coming from the outside.
[ct=5694.327] Picked it up initially, has time,
[ct=5697.257] throws, contact, flag, pass incomplete,
[ct=5700.490] but you got Stevenson covering McLaurin,
[ct=5705.199] who's been silent tonight.
[ct=5705.704] McLaurin only one target one catch coming in three yards.
[ct=5710.401] Going to call it against Chicago.
[ct=5712.013] On the defense, number 29.
[ct=5713.193] That's a spot foul, an automatic first down.
[ct=5718.220] Well, it's a great matchup.
[ct=5718.409] The reason McLaurin's had a quiet night
[ct=5719.585] is, again, going back to the plan, you got a rookie corner.
[ct=5722.948] He's not crazy.
[ct=5724.323] You're going up against a really talented receiver.
[ct=5725.554] You're giving him space.
[ct=5726.468] That out and up doesn't fool him.
[ct=5727.770] He's going to give up anything except something downfield,
[ct=5731.550] but he ends up getting caught with hands--
[ct=5733.306] Number 78 of the offense is reporting his own--
[ct=5736.245] The ball down inside the 2 yard line.
[ct=5737.778] 25 yard penalty on a pass that might not
[ct=5742.392] have been catchable to begin with going that far out
[ct=5746.818] of bounds.
[ct=5748.711] Logan Thomas lined up in the backfield.
[ct=5750.229] Now, he goes out on the wing to the right.
[ct=5753.340] Robinson is the back.
[ct=5756.353] Fake to him, and Howell on the run.
[ct=5758.187] Howell throws to the end zone.
[ct=5761.143] It's caught.
[ct=5762.544] Thomas, touchdown Washington.
[ct=5765.686] Man, they must have had a pretty good talking to each other
[ct=5768.869] in that locker room.
[ct=5770.425] That's the way you want to start the second half.
[ct=5772.252] Actually, Elijah Hicks plays this pretty well off the ball.
[ct=5780.989] They're going to go for two.
[ct=5784.100] 27-9.
[ct=5784.261] For what it's worth, it would make it
[ct=5785.826] a two possession lead, if they get it, to make it 27 to 11.
[ct=5791.033] So going for the deuce here.
[ct=5792.544] See, Hicks initially had him covered off the line.
[ct=5794.932] He was almost expecting that play action pass.
[ct=5797.535] But then just got his eyes on a quarterback
[ct=5800.020] and lost a big tight end there in coverage.
[ct=5803.960] And that secondary minus Eddie Jackson,
[ct=5808.101] who would be their top guy, going for a pair here.
[ct=5814.805] Howell again rolling, looking, going
[ct=5817.704] to keep it himself and get in there.
[ct=5820.944] Two-point conversion is good, so the crowd comes to life.
[ct=5825.751] The Commanders come to life.
[ct=5828.954] That took three minutes to go 75 yards.
[ct=5831.908] Five plays to make it 27 to 11.
[ct=5846.513] Please, please, please, please, please.
[ct=5851.412] The all new Hyundai Kona--
[ct=5858.546] You look into a camera, and you say I hate, yada yada,
[ct=5862.204] and I love that this company doesn't have any of that.
[ct=5867.333] Do you two know what yada yada is?
[ct=5870.479] Do you have an activation fee?
[ct=5871.277] Only when you activate.
[ct=5871.597] How many people do I need to get the best price?
[ct=5874.522] Only four.
[ct=5874.709] You shouldn't yada yada that because details matter.
[ct=5877.339] Yada yada, I'm already in an ad for Visible.
[ct=5881.464] Visible has no activation fees, no need for a family plan.

[ct=5950.564] Prestigious college, Columbus, Ohio?
[ct=5953.053] Absolutely.
[ct=5953.604] Could be.
[ct=5953.966] Yeah, Tempe?
[ct=5955.819] Yes, could be.
[ct=5960.070] Meanwhile, the Washington Commanders
[ct=5961.663] must have set their alarm clock for about 9:45 PM Eastern time
[ct=5967.035] because they woke up, and they woke up in a hurry
[ct=5969.397] after that horrific first half.
[ct=5972.079] Down the field they go in exactly three minutes,
[ct=5975.137] five first downs along the way.
[ct=5978.515] Plus Ron Rivera's comment to Kaylee.
[ct=5981.703] They talked to themselves."
[ct=5983.161] Perfect.
[ct=5983.490] "Let's play for each other."
[ct=5989.006] One more touchback.
[ct=5990.274] Well, what a first half for Justin Fields and the ability
[ct=5993.406] to get the ball out of his hands quicker than we've
[ct=5997.221] seen this year.
[ct=5998.571] 3.2 is a little bit long, but he had
[ct=6000.016] time to make the read because of the offensive line here.
[ct=6002.766] Much quicker with the pressure in his face.
[ct=6006.007] Able to make another great throw downfield.
[ct=6007.662] Here, even faster, 2.1 for the tight end to the--
[ct=6011.487] touchdown to the big tight end Kmet.
[ct=6013.326] So he has been in that zone.
[ct=6014.773] He's felt good every single possession.
[ct=6018.869] Points up on the board for the Bears.
[ct=6021.666] Near perfect first half offensively
[ct=6024.793] and defensively as well.
[ct=6029.217] Second half, Fields coming back the other way.
[ct=6036.401] He turns it into about a 3 yard gain.
[ct=6040.874] A lot of excitement there, and again, we
[ct=6043.867] thought we'd see more of this, him trying to get to the edge.
[ct=6046.526] They didn't really hide this at all.
[ct=6048.468] He just got a lead blocker with Herbert,
[ct=6050.226] but good job by the corner and the safety,
[ct=6052.767] beating him to the spot.
[ct=6054.304] Instead of him just giving up on the play,
[ct=6055.908] because of his athletic ability, he
[ct=6057.279] tries to keep that play alive.
[ct=6057.487] But that's the way you want to start if you're the Commanders
[ct=6061.747] defense, containing Fields and keeping him short of picking
[ct=6066.246] up some big yards.
[ct=6067.852] Once he went down, it was spotted after only a one yard
[ct=6072.275] pickup.
[ct=6073.916] Second and 9 for the fake toss.
[ct=6077.165] Keeps it himself.
[ct=6077.389] There he goes for a first down.
[ct=6079.834] Shoved out of bounds at the 40 yard line behind a Darnell
[ct=6084.005] The right tackle and rookie out of Tennessee
[ct=6086.153] was their first round pick.
[ct=6087.755] It's a really good follow up there by Luke Getsy.
[ct=6091.529] The defense is worried about the perimeter.
[ct=6093.219] They're worried about everything going outside
[ct=6095.112] because of the success in the first half.
[ct=6097.569] Instead, he fakes it and then counters back the other way
[ct=6100.805] and got some great blocks by that offensive line.
[ct=6102.619] You're right, Darnell Wright, the rookie right tackle,
[ct=6106.142] and Cole Kmet led the way that time for the first down.
[ct=6110.062] What a threat as a runner, Justin Fields.
[ct=6114.680] 9 carries the night.
[ct=6115.215] 42 yards.
[ct=6118.922] Tipped and incomplete.
[ct=6121.398] Montez Sweat got a hand on it.
[ct=6125.931] DaRon Payne forced that issue on the rush.
[ct=6128.702] Second and 10.
[ct=6130.439] What a match up here against Nate Davis.
[ct=6133.812] This is a tough matchup to the inside.
[ct=6137.321] Sweat's going to end up getting his hand on the football,
[ct=6138.987] but reason he's able to make that play is what you see right
[ct=6143.116] there, is the big fella, Daron Payne,
[ct=6144.775] look at him shed Davis and then pick up momentum.
[ct=6148.828] Field very fortunate to even get that ball out.
[ct=6158.310] Pressure, and that's caught.
[ct=6160.059] Moore gets back into the action after that.
[ct=6163.446] Super first half.
[ct=6165.143] DJ Moore had eight catches last week.
[ct=6169.451] Tonight, after a quick five, his first one
[ct=6173.915] since early in the second.
[ct=6175.301] Six targets, six catches.
[ct=6176.872] The adjustments Jack Del Rio has made
[ct=6180.893] is more movement with that front.
[ct=6181.082] They weren't able to win in the first half.
[ct=6182.774] He's adding linebackers now and blitzing that time
[ct=6186.823] with Jamin Davis.
[ct=6199.026] Third and 5.
[ct=6200.460] Fields under pressure.
[ct=6201.337] Escapes again.
[ct=6202.768] A little bit low, and it's Herbert there.
[ct=6207.029] Does not make the grab.
[ct=6211.360] Got rid of it through a too low fourth down,
[ct=6214.358] and Herbert is down.
[ct=6217.022] He bent backwards.
[ct=6219.138] The pressure is by Chase Young out here.
[ct=6221.223] Fields does a good job of stepping up,
[ct=6222.808] away from the pressure, and then he's a threat to run.
[ct=6226.952] And it puts Davis in a tough spot.
[ct=6228.021] He takes Fields, and that's where you worry about Herbert
[ct=6231.072] there, having to bend backwards to try to make that catch.
[ct=6236.918] And still work on Fields as we take a break--
[ct=6241.929] on Herbert.
[ct=6247.822] The regular season is just 18 weeks, just three days a week.
[ct=6252.352] Sometimes, just one game a day.
[ct=6253.943] So cherish every over and under before it's over on FanDuel
[ct=6260.148] because, before you know it, a cold night at the Buffalo Bills
[ct=6267.778] Bet $5 and get $200 in bonus bets guaranteed.
[ct=6276.253] I know, Tony.
[ct=6277.899] It's like they don't even believe the NFL on CBS streams
[ct=6280.462] live on Paramount Plus.
[ct=6282.054] Higher education isn't what it used to be.
[ct=6285.010] The NFL on CBS streams live on Paramount Plus.
[ct=6289.355] The NFL on CBS streams live--
[ct=6290.863] (SPEAKING TOGETHER) The Paramount Plus.
[ct=6302.290] This is why we teach.
[ct=6306.236] I'll be there in 30 minutes, I think.
[ct=6307.705] See you there.
[ct=6311.823] [dog whining]
[ct=6314.846] [car horns honking]
[ct=6316.218] I'm moving!
[ct=6317.562] Please, please, please, please.
[ct=6318.956] Oh, thank you.
[ct=6324.156] Rerouting.
[ct=6327.803] Class leading safety and tech features
[ct=6330.493] to elevate your commute.
[ct=6331.927] The all new Hyundai Kona.
[ct=6334.566] KFC's $20 filler box.
[ct=6335.419] (SINGING) Oh, yes, it's chicken night.
[ct=6337.639] Fried chicken night.
[ct=6339.386] Oh, yes, it's chicken night.
[ct=6342.248] Make it a chicken night with free delivery every Thursday.
[ct=6346.604] (SINGING) It's finger lickin' good.
[ct=6352.190] To those who feast on ribs the same way
[ct=6354.401] they feast on the competition, plop, plop, fizz,
[ct=6358.759] fizz, ballers.
[ct=6360.094] Alka-Seltzer, amazing fast heartburn relief.
[ct=6364.781] After the game, stay tuned for TNF Nightcap presented
[ct=6368.639] by Allstate.
[ct=6368.991] It's where the biggest stars sit down with our team
[ct=6372.631] The sky's the limit for this team.
[ct=6373.850] These fans are very excited about that.
[ct=6375.592] It's TNF Nightcap presented by Allstate tonight
[ct=6378.912] after the game.
[ct=6382.778] The Lincoln Memorial here in Washington DC.
[ct=6390.485] The good news right now is that Herbert
[ct=6392.984] was able to walk off the field.
[ct=6394.685] Went to commercial.
[ct=6396.378] He was still down there for close to a minute.
[ct=6397.778] They'll put him into the medical tent.
[ct=6399.164] He got bent backwards, and here's
[ct=6400.468] Chicago's first punt of the night.
[ct=6403.202] Trenton Gil sending it skyward.
[ct=6408.198] 11 yard line, Jameson Crowder trying
[ct=6411.712] to go around the left side.
[ct=6412.526] Able to turn the corner and turn it into a decent run back.
[ct=6419.753] 9 and 1/2 left in the third, and Washington with a quick drive.
[ct=6425.741] Three minutes to score and get the two point conversion.
[ct=6429.006] Whatever the Commanders, the players, said to each other,
[ct=6432.010] obviously, Ron Rivera's got to be
[ct=6434.033] excited with the idea and the concept and the energy
[ct=6438.903] Offense goes right down the field, five plays
[ct=6441.168] and a touchdown.
[ct=6442.522] Defense gets the Bears offense off the field,
[ct=6444.373] and just like that, they got the football back.
[ct=6447.132] 9 and 1/2 minutes here to go in the third quarter.
[ct=6452.777] Got the ball out underneath screen game that last drive.
[ct=6463.437] Four-man rush.
[ct=6464.573] Gets it away.
[ct=6466.353] Pick up six or seven on that first down play.
[ct=6470.042] They go to Logan Thomas one more time.
[ct=6472.390] He's been the main man, seven targets, seven catches for 56.
[ct=6477.865] Eric Bieniemy loves what he's seeing.
[ct=6478.969] His quarterback is following the orders of, hey,
[ct=6481.948] they're going to take away everything downfield.
[ct=6484.721] Let's send those receivers downfield.
[ct=6486.887] Let's open things up for our tight ends and our
[ct=6491.164] backs out of the backfield.
[ct=6499.168] We go five wide.
[ct=6505.031] It's going to be a first down here.
[ct=6508.003] Thomas tough-- ball comes out.
[ct=6509.493] Chicago thinks they have it, and they do.
[ct=6516.827] Ruling on the field is the ball was fumbled and recovered
[ct=6521.079] by the defense.
[ct=6522.926] Terell Smith comes away with it.
[ct=6524.416] That's the ruling on the field.
[ct=6526.043] Obviously, it gets checked out, so Thomas struggling, straining
[ct=6532.583] Winds up costing him.
[ct=6533.840] Yeah, and Greg Stroman's trying to get at the ball,
[ct=6535.338] but I think it was the rookie Smith, as you said,
[ct=6538.349] not just coming up with it.
[ct=6538.536] Stroman's in there knocking it away,
[ct=6539.937] but I think it's 32, with his right hand right there,
[ct=6543.779] pulls away to get that ball dislodged, and then
[ct=6545.660] right there, presents of mind to jump on it.
[ct=6547.823] How about the rookie out of Minnesota?
[ct=6550.606] Four year starter in college.
[ct=6551.972] Presence of mind to be aware that, hey, we
[ct=6554.677] got a shot to get this football out, and they do.
[ct=6559.080] Forced fumble, fumble recovery.
[ct=6560.489] They've checked it out.
[ct=6562.292] It's kosher, and they have it at the 46 yard line.
[ct=6576.749] Go up with a tight formation here.
[ct=6579.477] Field surveys, and he's going to go in his own territory.
[ct=6584.299] That time, Jonathan Allen got there to get the sack.
[ct=6591.704] Jonathan Allen lined up on the left side
[ct=6593.011] of this offensive line, and really good work here,
[ct=6598.027] being able to not give up on the play.
[ct=6600.534] He's handled there initially, but that
[ct=6602.177] swim move gets him through, and then
[ct=6603.658] he just picks up Justin Fields, who's 230 pounds.
[ct=6607.753] Picks him up and pile drives him into the ground.
[ct=6612.866] There's so much sensitivity to the quarterback and how he gets
[ct=6615.995] touched, and here he's a ball carrier.
[ct=6617.774] But man, that was a power--
[ct=6619.710] just a pile drive into the ground.
[ct=6621.755] Yeah, normally, you got to finesse him down.
[ct=6623.655] Second and 15.
[ct=6624.824] Here they come again.
[ct=6625.511] Off his back foot, Fields throws.
[ct=6628.444] Pressure on that time.
[ct=6629.685] Blasingame was the guy in the neighborhood.
[ct=6631.406] Cody Barton, that time, was the first guy in.
[ct=6634.260] Third and 15, and you've got a flag down.
[ct=6643.368] Scott Novak sidling over to his contemporaries.
[ct=6648.986] There is no foul for an illegal shift.
[ct=6650.423] Please set the play clock to 40 seconds.
[ct=6654.119] 40 on the play clock.
[ct=6658.025] They may not have talked to the players,
[ct=6659.506] but they talked to each other about adjustments as a defense.
[ct=6664.010] And because that front four wasn't winning,
[ct=6667.064] they have dialed up-- you see the backers right there?
[ct=6670.139] They actually brought both the backers on that play.
[ct=6675.294] So third down and 15.
[ct=6685.921] There is a quintessential false start.
[ct=6691.002] False start, offense number 69.
[ct=6693.966] That's a five yard penalty.
[ct=6695.403] Larry Borom, you saw Chase Young coming across the line.
[ct=6702.705] Whitehair moves to center.
[ct=6704.746] Carter now is in at left guard.
[ct=6706.357] They've had a few different combinations
[ct=6710.038] they've been working with, and this
[ct=6711.328] is the first time the crowd has been a factor to affect
[ct=6714.042] the communication up front.
[ct=6716.199] That was actually Ja'Tyre Carter moving over along that line,
[ct=6721.416] where they keep shuffling and juggling
[ct=6723.128] with all of the injuries.
[ct=6726.049] He was called third down and 20.
[ct=6727.999] Fields throwing.
[ct=6730.760] Again, the pressure, that time, took care of it,
[ct=6734.652] and they force a quick punt.
[ct=6738.251] Yeah, Whitehair moves to center.
[ct=6740.115] Carter is now at guard, and you still
[ct=6741.805] have a backup left tackle in Larry Borom who's in no man's
[ct=6746.791] land against Chase Young.
[ct=6746.970] We mentioned Chase Young looks healthier
[ct=6749.536] and looks back to his true form.
[ct=6752.116] Outside move, then gets underneath with that length
[ct=6754.933] and speed, and that really blew the play up.
[ct=6758.157] So again, these Commanders playing
[ct=6759.670] the way we expected them to play all game long,
[ct=6762.567] but it took them a half to get warmed up
[ct=6766.486] and to bring that pressure.
[ct=6767.887] So they survive the turnover, and the punt here
[ct=6774.737] will be down just outside the 15 yard line.
[ct=6777.848] 740 to go in the third quarter.
[ct=6780.522] It's Chicago 27, Washington 11.
[ct=6789.693] My dad went EV.
[ct=6791.102] It's electric.
[ct=6791.675] Don't be shocked.
[ct=6793.503] Nice car.
[ct=6795.284] It's an "ev."
[ct=6796.623] Introducing the all electric Hyundai Ioniq 6
[ct=6799.720] with up to 360 mile range.
[ct=6801.226] When it comes to EVs, we're thinking of every mile.
[ct=6803.762] I'm the heat on the street, and I'm asking women
[ct=6806.097] one burning question.
[ct=6807.895] What's VMS?
[ct=6810.874] A k-pop band?
[ct=6812.264] I have no idea.
[ct=6813.564] I don't know.
[ct=6815.020] What if I told you it actually has to do with menopause?
[ct=6816.957] Oh, Menopause?
[ct=6817.124] Yay.
[ct=6818.360] Well, then maybe I would say--
[ct=6819.771] Malicious sweat.
[ct=6821.188] Actually VMS stands for Vasomotor Symptoms,
[ct=6823.490] which is the medical term for hot flashes and night
[ct=6825.932] sweats due to menopause.
[ct=6828.590] That's what's making me hot at night.
[ct=6828.857] More like day and night.
[ct=6829.974] If you're heated about being overheated, go to whatsvms.com
[ct=6833.820] At Firehouse Subs, every sub is stacked
[ct=6836.405] with mouthwatering meats and cheeses in every bite,
[ct=6840.147] packed with big, bold flavors to answer every craving,
[ct=6843.263] served hot on a toasted roll every time.
[ct=6846.583] Only at Firehouse Subs.
[ct=6849.024] Young lady who is mid 30s, a couple of kids,
[ct=6852.713] recently went through a divorce, so she
[ct=6854.214] had a lot of questions when she came in.
[ct=6856.949] I watched my mother go through being a single mom.
[ct=6860.228] At the end of the day, my mom raised three children,
[ct=6864.913] including myself, and so once the client
[ct=6866.072] knew that she was heard, we were able to help her move forward.
[ct=6869.922] Your client won't care how much you know until they
[ct=6873.505] know how much you care.
[ct=6879.056] The NFL is back across the pond--
[ct=6882.419] As Trevor Lawrence and the Jags take
[ct=6883.790] on Josh Allen and the Bills.
[ct=6885.238] Live from London.
[ct=6887.408] Rise, shine, and watch.
[ct=6889.678] I'm him.
[ct=6890.288] Sunday at 9:30 on--
[ct=6892.533] [audio logo]
[ct=6894.154] [musical chord]
[ct=6897.788] Time for Tonight's Journey brought to you by Hyundai.
[ct=6901.647] Fields, in that first half against second straight week,
[ct=6906.246] tremendous first 30 minutes.
[ct=6910.399] Washington scoring on the first drive of the second half,
[ct=6914.430] getting the two point conversion.
[ct=6916.395] Bears haven't won since they went to New England
[ct=6919.052] and knocked off the Patriots last October the 24th.
[ct=6923.394] Part of turning a franchise around is not just Xs and Ox.
[ct=6928.996] It's a mentality.
[ct=6929.199] It's learning how to win, and right now, that's
[ct=6933.504] what Matt Eberflus is facing.
[ct=6935.080] He's trying to get his team to not just, hey,
[ct=6937.004] we're playing great for a half.
[ct=6939.187] We want to play 60 minutes.
[ct=6940.547] We want to learn how to win football games.
[ct=6943.602] He knows all too well.
[ct=6949.300] Slipping a tackle.
[ct=6949.313] Turning it into about a six yard pickup.
[ct=6951.706] Brian Robinson, Kaylee, what do know?
[ct=6954.802] Guys, we don't have official word yet on Bears running back
[ct=6957.536] Khalil Herbert, but he has been running up and down
[ct=6959.943] the sidelines behind the Bears bench,
[ct=6961.464] testing the range of motion of that right ankle
[ct=6963.642] that you saw bend back so uncomfortably.
[ct=6966.205] But that running back group tonight, guys,
[ct=6968.107] they have had a tough go.
[ct=6969.448] Travis Homer, he is now questionable with a hamstring.
[ct=6973.105] Roschon Johnson, that rookie is out
[ct=6975.230] because of a concussion, and D'Onta Foreman, he's inactive.
[ct=6978.745] So they've had to turn to that fullback
[ct=6980.776] Khari Blasingame to get somebody on the field in their place,
[ct=6984.234] but Khalil Herbert looks like he's doing everything
[ct=6985.929] to go again.
[ct=6986.701] Yeah, we'll see what happens when they're on offense.
[ct=6988.761] Meanwhile, that pass is hauled in by Gibson.
[ct=6991.720] Takes it to the 35 yard line.
[ct=6995.167] Down the sideline goes Gibson over Brister.
[ct=6998.035] That's a gain of 41.
[ct=6999.676] And now, that's the beauty of his versatility.
[ct=7002.282] He's a running back, really, slash receiver,
[ct=7005.278] and he's matched up one on one against Brisker,
[ct=7008.023] who's a safety.
[ct=7009.871] So this is a favorable matchup.
[ct=7011.521] It's not just a running back.
[ct=7013.042] Gibson knows how to run routes.
[ct=7014.031] He knows how to track the football, and a good job
[ct=7017.092] here by Sam Howell locating that matchup.
[ct=7020.096] No safety support.
[ct=7020.860] Gets the ball out at 2.7 seconds.
[ct=7022.736] Yeah, Gibson was the number one running back for two years.
[ct=7025.826] Now, he finds himself as a backup,
[ct=7028.726] and in Memphis, he did everything.
[ct=7032.012] To the 40, 35 yard line.
[ct=7034.693] That pass is caught, and taking it to the 20, Dotson.
[ct=7040.383] Jahan Dotson, number one pick out of Penn State last season.
[ct=7047.384] Now, you'll love this.
[ct=7048.269] Eyes just on Brisker.
[ct=7049.817] Comes down, quickly knows he's got that glance route,
[ct=7052.790] and he makes the decision off of Brisker coming down.
[ct=7055.713] He would have worked to the outside if he stayed back.
[ct=7058.025] Instead, he saw him slide down after the snap there,
[ct=7060.847] trying to fool him, being as young as he is,
[ct=7063.027] but he recognized it quickly and got the ball out in a hurry.
[ct=7069.004] At the 21.
[ct=7074.536] Now, look out!
[ct=7075.370] Sack, big play Stroman, who had the interception that
[ct=7080.878] led to a touchdown at the end of the first half
[ct=7083.155] and started his career with Washington.
[ct=7087.624] And now, again, we just talked about how they're disguising,
[ct=7091.587] Look at this safety right now.
[ct=7093.088] He doesn't look like he's going to cheat down and help out.
[ct=7094.950] See how they're hiding that blitz, and eventually late,
[ct=7098.729] this blitz comes right there.
[ct=7100.184] Safety comes over to take that zone area
[ct=7103.609] and completely-- you don't see his head.
[ct=7106.137] He doesn't even look.
[ct=7106.721] They disguised it so well, he didn't even
[ct=7109.559] look to think that was a threat to his left, to the blind side.
[ct=7113.455] Nine yard sack.
[ct=7114.218] Second and 19.
[ct=7117.289] Caught inside the 30.
[ct=7119.833] Dotson to the 22.
[ct=7122.960] Third and long.
[ct=7128.689] It'll be third and 12.
[ct=7131.785] 4 and 1/2 to go in the third.
[ct=7137.469] Matt Eberflus, who has taken over not just, obviously,
[ct=7140.643] head coaching duties, he's taken over as a defensive coordinator
[ct=7143.753] these last few weeks.
[ct=7143.953] He said he's able to manage throughout the week
[ct=7146.751] and still, obviously, deal with his day
[ct=7149.351] to day job as a head coach.
[ct=7150.906] But he's in there getting his defense prepared,
[ct=7153.467] going back to his roots.
[ct=7157.029] Rush four.
[ct=7158.234] Howell steps up.
[ct=7160.180] Runs into traffic.
[ct=7160.369] Gets away and stays in bounds and comes
[ct=7167.347] close to a first down.
[ct=7168.429] What a move, avoiding tackles, almost stepped out of bounds,
[ct=7173.086] and he's going to set up a fourth down and 2.
[ct=7176.477] But the athletic ability here, we've
[ct=7179.307] talked all night about Justin Fields being a threat
[ct=7180.941] and what he can do as a runner and a scrambler and ability
[ct=7186.921] They're booing because the field goal unit's coming out,
[ct=7188.550] but I mean, this looks like he's done.
[ct=7191.295] He's sacked.
[ct=7191.916] A stunt offensive line doesn't pick it up.
[ct=7194.070] I almost think he was ready to give up on it,
[ct=7196.948] but he just keeps kind of fighting it.
[ct=7198.390] Pump fake right there.
[ct=7202.551] So a 32 yard attempt.
[ct=7205.064] Washington trying to make it a 13 point deficit.
[ct=7210.434] Slye's kick is good.
[ct=7211.921] Crowd wanted him to go for it on the fourth,
[ct=7214.443] and it would have been fourth and 3.
[ct=7216.530] And with 3:17 to go in the third, 27-14 Bears.
[ct=7230.264] I am no devil.
[ct=7237.939] Catherine?
[ct=7240.209] [inaudible]
[ct=7241.741] Rated R, only in theaters Friday.
[ct=7243.216] (SINGING) Bigfoot, Bigfoot, get out the way.
[ct=7245.304] Bussing out there I'll be messing all day.
[ct=7247.730] Bussing out bails, we were selling that hay.
[ct=7250.910] We were moving that soul--
[ct=7252.199] Your light binder's ready.
[ct=7253.615] Can you order me 400 more of these headphones?
[ct=7255.046] (SINGING) I'ma show y'all how to move.
[ct=7257.149] Hey!
[ct=7257.807] You're going to like this story because it's
[ct=7258.810] about you, you who forgot to charge your phone last night,
[ct=7261.858] you who sprints to the boarding line
[ct=7264.257] so your bag will fit, you with him.
[ct=7267.077] Until one day, you boarded a United plane
[ct=7268.619] that was designed for, well, you,
[ct=7271.776] and your phone got charged.
[ct=7273.257] So did everyone else's, but this story isn't about them.
[ct=7276.298] Your toddler didn't tantrum, and you
[ct=7277.847] got to fly happily ever after, the end.
[ct=7288.444] It's a beautiful day for football
[ct=7289.917] and a beautiful day for a Bills victory.
[ct=7292.981] Bills lose 0 to 13.
[ct=7296.018] Pitched that one down the sideline.
[ct=7298.789] Oh, Bills fumble.
[ct=7300.057] Now, Norwood trying to kick is longest ever on grass.
[ct=7303.144] Score by Flutie.
[ct=7306.242] Go, Bills.
[ct=7307.757] Go, Buffalo!
[ct=7310.437] Thank you, grandpa.
[ct=7311.605] How do I look?
[ct=7313.090] Looks terrific.
[ct=7320.572] Amazon Music Live back at midnight Eastern time.
[ct=7322.318] Chicago rapper, Lil Durk, and our main host, 2 Chainz.
[ct=7326.779] Tune in right here on Prime Video.
[ct=7328.383] When the game ends, live music will begin.
[ct=7333.144] Looking up at the Washington Monument.
[ct=7334.700] Well, Dick Butkus passed away earlier today.
[ct=7338.711] There he was with George Halas and Gale Sayers.
[ct=7341.688] Sayers and Butkus were picked in the first round in 1965.
[ct=7348.265] They had the third and fourth picks.
[ct=7349.920] Wow.
[ct=7350.358] And when those two guys got honored a number of years ago,
[ct=7352.927] on either a Sunday or Monday night game at Soldier Field,
[ct=7357.637] you had Sayers and Butkus.
[ct=7358.610] I'll never forget, one of the newspapers
[ct=7360.056] had the headline was the picture of the two, Beauty
[ct=7364.015] and the Beast.
[ct=7367.768] Gale's hair is so smooth.
[ct=7369.260] Such an incredible athlete.
[ct=7370.080] And Dick Butkus is really the measure
[ct=7372.952] of linebackers from the time he played in college
[ct=7375.629] and forced a brilliant career in Chicago.
[ct=7377.713] Everybody compared everybody to Dick Butkus.
[ct=7380.698] But a man with a great sense of humor
[ct=7385.732] turned into a pretty good acting career.
[ct=7392.579] You got Trevor Lawrence picked first,
[ct=7393.902] you got Zach Wilson picked second, Lance third,
[ct=7396.886] so Lawrence working out pretty well.
