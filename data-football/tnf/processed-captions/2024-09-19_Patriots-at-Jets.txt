CAN REMEMBER BEFORE A JETS GAME. THERE HE IS AGAIN, LEADING THE JETS. THE PATRIOTS WON THE TOSS. THE JETS WILL RECEIVE. WE WILL SEE ROGERS -- RODGERS RIGHT OFF THE BAT. THE DYNAMIC KICKOFF RESULTING IN A FEW MORE TOUCHBACKS THAN MOST PEOPLE EXPECTED. I LOOK AT METLIFE STADIUM. ADORNED IN GREEN, WE WILL BE HERE NEXT THURSDAY NIGHT WHEN IT WILL BE BLUE AS THE GIANT TAKE ON THE COWBOYS ON THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL. XAVIER GIPSON, WHO RAN A PUNT BACK AGAINST BUFFALO ON OPENING NIGHT LAST YEAR. BACK TO RECEIVE AND RODGERS AND COMPANY WILL TAKE OVER AT THE 30 YARD LINE. WE HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION, OUR MEETING WITH RODGERS, HE IS AS EXCITED AS HE HAS EVER BEEN AND SAVORING THE MOMENT AT 40 YEARS OLD. HE IS TOTALLY IMMERSED IN THE JETS AND THEIR FORTUNES THIS YEAR. KIRK: WE TALKED TO HIM FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND HE TALKED ABOUT THE PROCESS, IT IS NOT JUST THE GAME BUT HE LOVES MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY GETTING READY FOR THE GAME. AL: THE RUNNING BACK IS BREECE HALL. PLAY-ACTION, THE THROW AND IT IS CAUGHT FOR A 5 YARD GAIN. GARRETT WILSON STOP BY GONZALES. KIRK: HE MADE A BIG POINT THIS WEEK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE -- THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS AARON RODGERS TALKED ABOUT, WE HAVE TO GET HIM THE BALL EARLY. AL: THEY GO NO-HUDDLE TO QUICKEN THE PACE. AARON SURVEYING ON A SECOND DOWN AND 4. HERE COMES THE BLITZ, IT IS PICKED UP. SLIDES TO A FIRST DOWN. HE WAS PICKED UP ON THE BLOCK IN THE BACKFIELD. FIRST DOWN. KIRK: THE WHOLE STADIUM EXCITED, AND ON THE OTHER, GET DOWN, TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AFTER A YEAR AGO. AL: FROM THE 41 YARD LINE. HE BROUGHT THAT FROM GREEN BAY WITH HIM, AND THAT IS CALLED IN -- HAULED IN. MIKE WILLIAMS. THEY WILL SPOT HIM, THEY SPOTTED HIM LAST WEEK AND PROBABLY AGAIN TONIGHT. KIRK: NINE SNAPS ON THE OPENER AGAINST SAN FRANCISCO, LOOK AT THE EFFORT AND THE LENGTH HE HAS. HE COULD BE A SECRET THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF GARRETT WILSON. THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE MIKE WILLIAMS GET HEALTHY AND BE THAT THIRD OPTION. AL: SECOND AND 5, QUICK THROW OUTSIDE, ACROSS THE 50. FIRST DOWN AT THE 43 YARD LINE. MARCUS JONES GOT STIFF-ARMED. FIRST DOWN, NEW YORK. KIRK: THIS IS THE CHALLENGE AGAINST AARON RODGERS, YOU WILL SIT BACK, BE SOFT, AND GIVE HIM THE QUICK THROW, HE WILL TAKE IT. THE OFFENSIVE LINE IS RUNNING A PLAY, HE HAS THAT QUICK THROW TO LAZARD. I DON'T KNOW IF ANOTHER QUARTERBACK HAS THE FIELD PRE-SNAP BETTER THAN AARON RODGERS. AL: RODGERS LOOKING LEFT, NOW RIGHT, FLUSHED OUT. DOWNFIELD, GOING TO THE END ZONE, AND BROKEN UP IN THE END ZONE. JONATHAN JONES BREAKING IT UP. IT WAS MIKE WILLIAMS WHO COULD NOT HAUL IT IN. KIRK: MORGAN MOSES WILL BE CALLED FOR HOLDING HERE. >> HOLDING, OFFENSE #78. 10 YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN. KIRK: RODGERS GOT OUT OF THE POCKET AND MOSES STARTS TO PANIC AND LOCK UP. THAT WAS JENNINGS. FOR A GUY COMING OFF AN ACHILLES , BOUNCING AROUND AND LOOKING GOOD ON THIS OPENING DRIVE. AL: ABSOLUTELY. IT WAS A FAST REHAB. HAD THEY BEEN IN PLAYOFF CONTENTION, THE IDEA OF HIM COMING BACK. RODGERS UNDER PRESSURE, DOWN HE GOES, SACKED AT THE 41. HE IS TAKEN DOWN FOR THE SECOND. IT WILL BE SECOND AND 26. KIRK: THEY LIKE TO STUNT, MOVE AROUND FROM THE OUTSIDE IN, AND AFFECTED THE OFFENSIVE LINE. YOU HAVE THREE NEW PIECES UP FRONT. SIMPSON AND SMITH ARE STILL FEELING EACH OTHER OUT AND TRYING TO COMMUNICATE. THAT TIME THE PATRIOTS WERE ABLE TO GET THAT PRESSURE. AL: SECOND AND 26, TRIES TO PICK UP A FEW ON THE RUN. BREECE HALL. THEY BROUGHT IN TWO VETERAN TACKLES, SMITH WHO CAME WITH THE COWBOYS. AND MORGAN MOSES, HIS 11TH YEAR FOR BALTIMORE. KIRK: YOU THROW IN SIMPSON AT LEFT GUARD, AND TUCKER, THE RIGHT GUARD, A FORMER FIRST ROUNDER WENT OUT WITH AN ACHILLES HIMSELF. FOUR GUYS TRYING TO COME TOGETHER. AL: THIRD AND 19. FOUR MAN RUSH, CUTTING BACK TO THE 33 YARD LINE. IT WAS BREECE HALL. PEPPERS MAKING THE TACKLE. FOURTH AND LONG, AND THEY WILL SEND IN IN ALL LIKELIHOOD THE PUNT GROUP. THESE DAYS, WHO KNOWS. THE 58 YARD FIELD GOAL IS LIKE A CHIP SHOT THESE DAYS. MARCUS JONES SETS UP INSIDE THE 10. HE PUTS SOME BACKSPIN ON IT AND IT BOUNCES INTO THE END ZONE. MID-70'S. THERE IS THE STATUE OF LIBERTY. WE ARE BACK AT METLIFE OR THE PASS HAVE THE BALL -- THE PATS HAVE THE BALL. A PLAY FAKE, AND NO GAIN THAT TIME. WILLIAMS MADE THE TACKLE ON HENRY, WHO CAUGHT EIGHT OF THE 17 COMPLETIONS LAST WEEK IN THE GAME AGAINST SEATTLE. JACOBY BRISSETT IS A GREAT STORY. THROUGH THE YEARS PERSEVERING. HE HAS BEEN IN SOME STRANGE AND ODD PLACES. A LOOK AT HIS CAREER NUMBERS, HE WAS DRAFTED BY THE PATRIOTS OUT OF N.C. STATE IN THE THIRD ROUND IN 2016. TO THE RIGHT SIDE, ONLY A YARD GAINED BY STEPHENSON -- STEVENSON. KIRK: THIS IS AN OFFENSE THAT WANTS TO BE SMART. WITH WHERE THEY ARE WITH RESET AND WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE OFFENSIVE LINE, THEY HAVE TO STAY AHEAD OF THE CHAINS. THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO BE THIRD AND 9 AGAINST THE JETS DEFENSE. TWO ROOKIES ARE STARTING KAYDEN WALLACE MAKING HIS FIRST CAREER START AT LEFT TACKLE. AL: ALEX VAN PELT COMES OVER FROM CLEVELAND TO RUN THE OFFENSE. LOOK OUT, PRESSURE IS PUT ON. THAT TIME IT WAS QUINCY WILLIAMS COMING IN. THE QUARTERBACK WAS OUT OF THE POCKET. MAYO TOLD US IN OUR MEETING THAT THE KEY WILL BE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR FRONT BUT THAT JETS' FRONT SO FAR AS BURSTING THROUGH. KIRK: THEY ARE NOT HAVING A PITY PARTY FOR THIS INEXPERIENCED OFFENSIVE LINE. THIS OFFENSE HAS TO BE IN THOSE THIRD AND MANAGEABLE, THIRD AND 9 WILL NOT WORK WITH THIS AL: GIBSON IS BACK AND MAKES THE CATCH ALONG THE SIDELINE. PICKS UP ABOUT THREE MORE YARDS, THIS LAST YEAR WITH THE DEFENSIVE ALERTS. YOU'LL SEE THEM ON THIRD DOWNS, SOM SECOND DOWN. WHERE THE QUARTERBACK HAS TO BE AWARE OF THE ALERT OF THE PRESSURE, WHERE IT MIGHT COME FROM AND THAT TIME THE ALERTS WERE DEAD ON WITH THAT PRESSURE FROM THE JETS. AL: THE 20-YEAR-OLD ROOKIE, THE YOUNGEST PLAYER IN THE LEAGUE. YOUTH MUST BE SERVED. I'LL SAY. GAIN OF 10. IS HE WAS GREAT WEEK. TWO TOUCHDOWNS, BROKE AWAY FROM MCMILLAN THAT TIME. FIRST DOWN. KIRK: THE FIRST SERIES WE SAW A LOT OF EMPTY, THREE-RECEIVER LOOKS. THEY COME WITH THE LONE BACK AND ALONG WITH THAT THREE TIGHT ENDS IN FRONT OF HIM. SO THEY GO TO FROM SPREAD TO TRYING TO CHALLENGE YOU WITH AARON RODGERS TO THE BIG THREE TIGHT END TIGHT END. AL: THREE YEARS AT WISCONSIN FOR ALLEN. FOURTH-ROUND DRAFT CHOICE. AGAIN TAKES IT TO THE 40. A PRETTY GOOD COMBO PLATTER THEY EVER GOING WITH ALLEN CAN DO WHAT WE THINK HE CAN DO AND BREECE HALL BACK THERE. KIRK: I SAW HIM A LOT AT WISCONSIN. LIKE YOU SAID, HE IS A BIG BACK AND THEY'RE STILL LEARNING ABOUT HIS SIZE AT 235 AND A GREAT COMPLIMENT COMPLEMENT TO WHAT BREECE HALL CAN DO. SAW THAT LAST WEEK. CAN BE POWERFUL IN HIS OWN RIGHT BUT BOTH OF THESE TWO TOGETHER HEALTHY CAN BE DANGEROUS. AL: SECOND DOWN AND 5. RODGERS LOOKING, ROLLING, THROWING AND COMPLETING AND A FIRST DOWN AND FIGHTING FOR SOME EXTRA YARDAGE. NUMBER TWO TIGHT END, FIRST DOWN, NEW YORK. KIRK: THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF RUNNING THE FOOTBALL. YOU CAN AFF EYE. EVEN A DISCIPLINED DEFENSE LIKE THIS. YOU RUN THE BALL A COUPLE OF TIMES, YOU START TO GET INTO THAT BIG, POWERFUL LOOK FOR THAT DEFENSE ASSUMING THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A RUN AND NATHANIEL HACKETT ONE STEP AHEAD GOING THE OTHER WAY WITH THAT PLAY-ACTION PASS. AL: RUCKERT WAS TARGETED THREE TIMES LAST SUNDAY BUT DIDN'T HAVE A CATCH CATCH. MAKES A CATCH BUT RIGHT THERE TO THROW HIM IN THE GROUND AND THROW THAT FLAG IS JELANI THAT VIE. TAVAI WAS RIGHT THERE, RED IT BEAUTIFULLY, MADE A NICE PLAY AND THEN, TOO MUCH. KIRK: IF I'M A JETS FAN -- REFEREE: AFTER THE PLAY WAS OVER. PERSONAL FOUL, UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS, DEFENSE, NUMBER 48. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. KIRK: REMEMBER, JA'WUAN LENT JA'WUAN L BENTLEY IS THE LEADER OF THIS DEFENSE AND HE'S OUT FOR THE YEAR SO THEY TURNED TO TAVAI. HERE'S A KNEW GUY ON THE TEAM, JOHN SIMPSON COMES OVER TO DEFEND HIS GUY. HE NORTHWESTERN SAW THAT FROM THE JETS LINE LAST YEAR. NICE BY THE BIG MAN. AL: SIMPSON, FIFTH YEAR. ANOTHER GUY WHO CAME OVER FROM BALTIMORE AS DID MOSES THE RIGHT TACKLE. THE BALL STAYS IN THE BACKFIELD. KIRK: SO HE CANS IT. NEW ENGLAND ADJUSTS THEIR COVERAGE. AL: AND THE CHANGEUP. RUN THROUGH THE MIDDLE AND A NICE HOLE AND CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN IS BREECE HALL. KIRK: YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS. COMBINATION POLLACK WITH THE RIGHT GUARD. TUCKER COMES DOWN AND HELPS. THIS IS WHAT YOU LOVE TO SEE WITH A NEW OFFENSIVE LINE STILL GETTING FAMILIAR WITH ONE ANOTHER. BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE. A LOT OF DIFFERENT LOOKS FROM NEW ENGLAND. WORK TO THE SECOND LINE OF RAEKWON MCMILLAN. AL: BRISSETT ON THE SIDELINES. RODGERS HAS TIME, THROWS. ALONG THE SIDELINE, NO. OUT OF BOUNDS. GARRETT WILSON ON CHALK, COVERED BY CHRISTIAN GONZALEZ. IT WILL BE SECONDS DOWN AND 10. KIRK: THIS IS THE MATCHUP WE ALL THE WANTED TO SEE. WILSON AGAINST GONZALEZ. AARON RODGERS BRINGS HIM BACK ON THAT BACK SHOULDER. DOESN'T QUITE GET THAT SECOND FOOT DOWN. LOVED THE FACT THAT WHEN HE THREW THAT FOOTBALL HE WAS RIGHT WITH HIM. IT SHOWS YOU THE CONFIDENCE THAT RODGERS HAS IN THE RECEIVER WILSON. AL: RODGERS WAS 6-6. HISS FIRST INCOMPLETION. FIRES, CAUGHT. ANOTHER FIRST DOWN. XAVIER GIPSON MAKING THE CATCH THERE. SECOND-YEAR MAN OUT OF STEPHEN F. AUSTIN AND FIRST AND BOLE FOR THE JETS. KIRK: AMAZE KIRK: AMAZING HOW NATHANIEL HACKETT ALL OF A SUDDEN KNOWS HOW TO CALL PLAYS. SHOWING A LITTLE BIT OF MAN BECAUSE OF THAT ROUTE THAT THE JETS RAN BUT GREAT SEPARATION THERE BY GIBSON. QUICK SLOT RECEIVER. AL: BALL RIGHT ON THE 10 AND ARE A FIRST AND GOAL. QUICK THROW. GOOD MOVE AND DESPITING ON TO IT INTO THE END ZONE GOES ALLEN LAZARD. GREAT MOVE ON ALEX BOTCH THAT TIME AND THE JETS FANS, SOMETHING TO GO WILD ABOUT AFTER LAST SEASON. GREAT-LOOKING DRIVE ON THAT DRIVE. EIGHT PLAYS, 73 YARDS. THREE RUSHES, FIVE PASSES. KIRK: AND LAZARD'S EXPERIENCE UNDERSTANDING THAT AT ANY CHANCE, ANY MOMENT RODGERS WILL GET A RUN PLAY. HE COMES OUT OF IT. QUICK RELEASE, AS ALWAYS FROM AARON RODGERS AND GIVES HIM A CHANCE AFTER THE CATCH TO GET INTO THE CORNER FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. AL: GREG ZIERLEIN FOR THE EXTRA POINT AND THE NEW YORK JETS WITH 4:21 TO GO IN 11 HERE AS A VISITOR. KIRK: LAZARD DID NOT HESITATE. AS SOON AS HE GOT TO THE END ZONE HE SPRINTED OVER TO HIS MAN AARON RODGERS TO GIVE HIM THAT AL: 60% OF THE KICKOFFS SO FAR THIS SEASON HAVE GONE LIKE THAT, FOR TOUCHBACKS. SO NOW THE PATRIOTS, WHO HAVE RUN A TOTAL OF THREE PLAYS AND THE JETS HAVE RUN 15 AND HERE COMES BRISSETT. DRAFTED BY THE PATRIOTS. HE WAS GOING TO BE THE PRACTICE SQUAD QUARTERBACK BUT THAT WAS THE YEAR, 2016, BRAIDSY GOT SUSPENDED FOR FOUR GAMES. GAROPPOLO GOT HURT. BRISSETT PLAYED TWO GAMES AND THEN BRAID CAME BACK. THEY WON THE SUPER BOWL. KIRK: A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMPACT HIM. SUCH A CEREBRAL QUARTERBACK AND I THINK IT'S WHY HE CONTINUES TO GET THESE OPPORTUNITIES. AL: PASS THE CAUGHT. TRYING TO COME BACK TO THIS SIDE IS DEMARIO DOUGLAS WHO WAS FRUSTRATED IN WEEK TALKING ABOUT NOT GETTING TARGETED LAST GETS TARGETED HERE BUT NO ROOM TO ROAM, SECONDS AND LONG. KIRK: YOU'RE STARTING TWO ROOKIES UP FRONT. IT'S A GRAHAM WHERE YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO POSSESS THE FOOTBALL AND KEEP IT AWAY FROM AARON RODGERS. THAT'S NOT GOING WELL, AND YOU NEEDS TO STAY AHEAD OF THE CHAINS. AL: SECOND AND 9. HANGS IN THE POCKET. CAUGHT BUT ONLY A VERY SHORT GAIN HERE. JOELEN JOEJAYLINN JOEJAYJA'LYNN POLK, GOOD-LOOKING ROOKIE. KIRK: SURE IS. POLK HAD A GREAT THIS IS WHERE THEY? WANT TO BE, A CHANCE FOR THIS OFFENSIVE LINE ON ROAD TO TRY TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS CROWD AND IT GIVES THEM OPTIONS WITH BRISSETT OR WITH THE BIG BACK STEVENSON. AL: THIRD DOWN AND 3. TO THE LEFT SIDE. STEVENSON IS THE MAN IN MOTION. BRISSETT FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE AND INTO TRAFFIC AND TAKEN IN THERE BY HUNTER HENRY. HE CAUGHT EIGHT PASSES LAST WEEK. THEY COMPLETED A TOTAL OF 17. DIRK: AND HE'S GOT FIVE RECEIVERS OUT. HENRY IS HERE, GOING TO WORK INTO MIDDLE OF THAT DEFENSE. MOSERY IS NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT PRIMING THAT LEADERSHIP. GIVE CREDIT TO THE OFFENSIVE LINE, RIGHT, AGAINST THAT JETS PASS RUSH. GOOD JOB HOLDING UP ON THIRD TOWN. AL: FIRST DOWN HERE, STEELERS ARE LOOKING FOR ROOM. NOT MUCH. TAKEN DOWN JUST SHY OF MIDFIELD BY QUINCY WILLIAMS WITH 2:30 TO GO IN QUARTER. KIRK: STEVENSON HAS BEEN A WORKHORSE THESE FIRST COUPLE OF WEEKS. HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THEM CLOSING OUT THAT WIN ON ROAMED. 25 CARRIES, 21 LAST WEEK AGAINST SEATTLE. PHYSICAL BACK BUT REALLY ELUSIVE. AL: EARLY IN THE GAME THEY BRING IN A SIXTH LINEMAN, ZACH THOMAS. BRING A LITTLE BEEF UP FRONT. SECONDS DOWN AND 7. THE PLAY FAKE, PROTECTION IS GOOD AND THE PASS IS NO GOOD. THAT'S INTENDED FOR AUSTIN COOPER, THE TO MAKE IT THIRD AND 7. KIRK: TRYING TO GIVE THE INDICATER TO THE JETS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO RUN THE THE ONLY NEGATIVE THING IS NOW YOU HAVE THIRDS DOWN. THE JETS DON'T BLITZ A LOT. THEY RELY ON THEIR FRONT FOUR TO BE ABLE TO GET HOME AND PLAY ZONE. THEY'RE SHOWING IT. AL: HERE THEY COME. STACKED UP FRONT AND GET TO HIM. SACKED BACK AT THE 40-YARD LINE. PROTECTION BREAKS DOWN. MCDONALD WAS THERE. HE HAD THREE SACKS FLAG THROWN ON PLAY. REFEREE: ILLEGAL FORMATION, OFFENSE NUMBER 70. THAT PENALTY IS DECLINED, FOURTH AL: A PENALTY ON IT LEGAL FORMATION ON WALLACE, THE ROOKIE LEAVITT TACKLE. KIRK: THE BIG EMPHASIS THIS YEAR. THOSE TACKLES. JUST ON THAT THURSDAY DOWN, THE OFFENSIVE LINE CLAPSES ON BRISSETT. NEVER -- CHANGEUPSES ON BRISSETT. NEVER HAD A SHOT. AL: TO BARINGER WITH HIS SECONDS PUNT. XAVIER GIPSON SETS UP AT HIS OWN 10-YARD LINE. ALMOST BLOCKED. FAIR CATCH CALLED FOR AND MADE AT THE 10-YARD LINE. AL: THAT LAST SACK FOR THE JETS. HALF A SACK EACH FOR MCDONALD. GIVING HIM THREE AND A HALF NOW BETWEEN LAST SUNDAY AND TONIGHT AND MICHEAL CLEMONS. RODGERS AFTER THAT GREAT DRIVE. ONLY ONE INCOMPLETED PASS SO FAR. HE'S TARGETED SIX DIFFERENT RECEIVERS LESS THAN 14 MINUTES INTO THE GAME. START ON THE GROUND. ABOUT FOUR FOR BREECE HALL. KIRK: EARLIER IN THE YEAR A LOT OF JETS FANS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT WHO WERE GOING TO BE THE OTHER OPTIONS? LAZARD, GIBSON MAYBE AND TONIGHT WE'VE SEEN MIKE WILLIAMS GETTING AROUND. BRAYLON EDWARDS AS A POTENTIAL TARGET. THINK ABOUT THIS OFFENSE. OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. 2019, 21ST, 22ND, 29TH, 29TH AND WITH NUMBER EIGHT BACK THERE THERE'S HOPE THIS OFFENSE CAN BE PRODUCTIVE. AL: ON THE OUTSIDE, DANGEROUS THROW AND HAULEDDED IN ONE-HANDED BY HALL TO MAKE IT THIRD DOWN AND WITH A HALF A MINUTE TO GO AND A FLAG DO YOU. JOHN HUSSEY TO MAKE THE CALL. REFEREE: HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER 83. HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL, SECOND DOWN. AL: THAT'S TYLER KONG LEN. AND THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT SECOND DOWN AND 12. HALF THE DISTANCE BACK TO THE 7-YARD LINE. KIRK: THAT BALL GETS THROWN RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF HIM AND I THINK THAT LEFT HAND ON THE SHOULDER PAD COULD BE THE ONLY THING THAT YOU SEE. AL: RODGERS ALWAYS LOOKS AM NICHENT BACK THERE. THOSE EYES CHECKING OUT EVERYTHING. SECOND AND 1 IS UP TO THE 13-YARD LINE GOES BREECE HALL TAKE US TO THE ENDS OF THE QUARTER. THE HUDSON TO THE MEADOWLANDS. TO THE HEM OF THE JETS AND THE GIANTS. AL MICHAELS, KIRK HERBSTREIT, KAYLEE HARTUNG. THIRD DOWN AND 6 FOR NEW YORK AS WE START THE SECOND QUARTER. JETS ON TOP 7-0. RODGERS, PRESSURE, GETS AWAY. THROWS, CAUGHT. BREAKING AWAY IS LAZARD TO LAZARD WHO SCOREED THE TOUCHDOWN. STILL GOING. OUT TO THE 41-YARD BROKE AWAY FROM JONATHAN JONES BUT DOWN ON THE GROUND RIGHT NOW FOR THE PATRIOTS AFTER A 20-YARD GAIN IS JABRILL PEPPERS. THE FORMER NEW YORK GIANT WEARING THAT GUARDIAN HELMET AND LOOKS OFF. KIRK: RODGERS HAS SHOWN THAT ATHLETIC ABILITY. 40 YEARS OLD, MOVING AROUND VERY WELL. FEELS PRESSURE. A GOOD JOB AGAIN BY THAT OFFENSIVE LINE TAKING CARE OF HIM. AL: PEPPERS WILL GO UNDER THE BLUE TENT. AND THE JETS HAVE A FIRST DOWN AT THE RODGERS 9-10 FOR 90 PLAY-ACTION. THROWS UNDERNEATH. TO THE 45 OF NEW ANOTHER BIG GAIN. JONES MAKES THE STOP. PICKS UP 1 4. KIRK: I THINK ANYBODY WATCHING IS EXCITED TO SEE NUMBER EIGHT DO HIS THING. IT'S NOT JUST HIM, HIS WISDOM AND EXPERIENCE, IT'S HIS ACCURACY AND THEN THE YARDS AFTER THE CATCH. LAZARD ON THE TOUCHDOWN AND SOME OTHER CATCHES THAT HE'S HAD. NOW IT'S BREECE HALL SO HIS TEAMMATES REALLY HELPING HIM OUT HERE AFTER THE CATCH MAKING SOME BIG PLAYS. AL: NOTHING LIKE YAC, YARDS AFTER THE CATCH, FAR QUARTERBACK. AND A BIG HOLE HERE AS ALLEN PICKS UP 1 IS THREE PLAYS, BIG GAINS. THEY'RE ALREADY DOWN TO THE PATRIOT 35-YARD KIRK: WATCH THE RIGHT GUARD, TUCKER. OPENS IT UP VERY, VERY NICELY AND WHEN YOU GET BRAELON ALLEN RUNNING DOWNHILL FOLLOWING JEREMY RUCKERT, HE IS A HANDFUL TO BRING DOWN FOR THOSE SAFETIES. AL: ANOTHER BIG HOLE AND ANOTHER BIG GAIN. THAT TIME THEY BROUGHT BAITS PROVIDING THE LEVERAGE. GAIN OF SEVEN. SECONDS AND 3. KIRK: I'M SO FASCINATED WITH THE IMPROVEMENT OF THIS OFFENSIVE LINE. YOU AND I HAD THEM TWICE LAST YEAR AND THEY TRIED 13 DIFFERENT OFFENSIVE LINE COMBINATIONS. MOST IN THE NFL. THEY WERE DOING ANYTHING THEY COULD. THEY MADE THAT A PRIORITY IN OFF-SEASON, THEY BROUGHT IN THREE NEW FACES. THEY'RE STARTING TO REALLY COME TOGETHER AND TONIGHT OPENING UP SOME GREAT RUNNING LANES. AL: AND BUSTING THROUGH THE -- TAVAI MAKING THE PLAY FOR A LOSS OF A COUPLE SETTING UP A THIRD DOWN AND 5 3:00 INTO KIRK: NATHANIEL HACKETT FIRED UP TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THIS GROUP. CRITICIZED TWO YEARS AGO AGO AS A HEAD COACH IN DENVER. COMES TO NEW YORK, THINGS DON'T GO VERY WELL LAST YEAR. THE WHOLE AARON ROGERS INJURY. INJURIES UP FRONT. HE, OF COURSE, WAS THE SCAPEGOAT AND NOW SHOWING WHAT WE CAN DO WITH RODGERS AND A FULL COMPLEMENT AROUND HIM. AL: THAT'S CAUGHT. WILSON MAKES THE CATCH AT THE 20-YARD LINE. RODGERS LOVES HACKETT. HE SAID IF YOU EXECUTE HE'S A GREAT COACH. IF YOU DON'T, HE TAKES A LOT OF CRAP AND THAT'S TOO BAD. I LOVE HIS SCHEMES AND PHILOSOPHY. I WANT TO PLAY REALLY WELL SO HE GETS THE CREDIT HE DESERVES. KIRK: ANY OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, WHEN YOU EXECUTE THE PLAYS LOOK GREAT AND ONE OF THE THINGS AARON RODGERS LOVES TAKING THE PLAY SHEET AND BRINGING IT ALIVE THE DAY OF THE GAME AND A LOT OF TIMES IMPROVISING AND MAKING ADJUSTMENTS AT ON THE SIDELINE LIKE HE DID LAST WEEK AT TENNESSEE. AL: CAUGHT AND THIS TIME IT'S ANFERNEE JENNINGS. LOSS OF SEVEN ON SECONDS AND 17. KIRK: MIKE WILLIAMS TRIES TO MAKE BLOCK BUT HE CANNOT HANDLE SIZE AND QUICKNESS OF HE GETS INTO THAT JENNINGS WAS A GUY WAITING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY LAST MATTHEW JUDON GOES DOWN WITH THAT HE GOES FROM BEING A ROLE PLAYER TO AN OPPORTUNITY, TAKES ADVANTAGE OF IT AND NOW IS A GUY THEY'RE REALLY COUNTING ON ON THIS DEFENSE. AL: SECONDS AND 17. FIRES, CAUGHT ON MOVE. IT'S A FIRST AND TYLER CONKLIN TO THE 5-YARD LINE. AARON RODGERS WITH THAT FLICK OF THE WRIST. MAKES EITHER LOOK SO SIMPLE. KIRK: HE'S IN TOTAL CONTROL. WATCH HIS HEAD MOVE TO THE RIGHT TO TRY MOVE THIS LINEBACKER RAEKWON. HE NEEDS THAT MIDDLE TO OPEN UP SO HE MOVES MILLER, COMES BACK TO CONKLIN. THE JETS ARE SAYING WHERE'S TIGHT ENDS? QUICK RELEASE, PERFECT ACCURACY AND MORE YARDS AFTER THE CATCH. AL: 12-13, 135 FOR RODGERS. FIRST AND GOAL. ON THE GROUND TO THE OUTSIDE THEN BACK TO THE MIDDLE UP TO ABOUT 1. BREECE HALL IS STOPPED SECONDS DOWN AND GOAL. KIRK: BRAELON ALLEN IS THAT PHYSICAL BACK AT 35. REFEREE: NUMBER 95 -- KIRK: BREAKS THROUGH THE SAFETY THERE WILL, KYLE DUGGER. GOOD JOB. ACTUALLY IT'S 1, HAWKINS WHO'S IN AL: SOLOMON THOMAS, THE LINEMAN COMES IN TO LINE UP IN THE THERE HE IS AS THE FULLBACK. HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF MOTION HERE. FAKE IT TO HIM AND THEN IT'S SENT TO THE END ZONE AND INCOMPLETE. TRIED A LITTLE PASS A LITTLE LOW. CONKLIN COVERED ON SETS UP THIRD DOWN AND KIRK: REALLY GOOD DISCIPLINE FOR KYLE DUGGER TO BE IN POSITION, NOT BE FOOLED. GO TO THAT JUMBO FORMATION WITH THREE TIGHT ENDS. YOU'RE THINKING RUN AGAIN BUT IT'S A HE'S GOTT TIME BUT JUST GREAT COVERAGE BY DUGGER. RUBBING ERTZ IS THE ON GROUNDS. CAN HE GET? HE ROLLS AND THEY'RE GOING TO SAY HE'S SHORT. JENNINGS IS THERE. ATTACK ANOTHER PEEK HERE. KIRK: JENNINGS MAKES A HECK OF AN EFFORT. I THINK THAT'S A I THINK HE BROKE THE PLANE. TIKI: CROWD, OF COURSE, IS SEEING WHAT YOU ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW. TERRY MCAULEY, WHAT DO YOU SNEE TERRY: HE'S UP. THAT KNEE IS NOT DOWN WHEN THE BALL BREAKS THE PLANE. COACH'S CHALLENGE. WE'LL SEE FROM THE REPLAY ASSISTANT. KIRK: FOURTH DOWN AND REFEREE: THE NEW YORK JETS ARE CHALLENGING THE RULING ON FIELDS THAT THE RUNNER WAS SHORT OF GOAL LINE. TIME-OUT. REFEREE: AFTER REVIEW, THE RUNNER DID GET THE BALL ACROSS THE GOAL IT IS A TOUCHDOWN. RESET THE GAME CLOCK TO 8:32, PLEASE. 832. AL: CHALLENGE UPHELD. ANOTHER GREAT DRIVE. THE JETS HAVE SCORED ON BACK-TO-BACK DRIVES. 13 PLAYS, 91 YARDS. ALL OF LAST SEASON, TWICE THEY SCORED ON BACK-TO-BACK DRIVES, TOUCHDOWNS. THIS YEAR THEY'VE ALREADY DONE IT TWICE. DID IT IN TENNESSEE AND NOW TONIGHT. KIRK: THIS FIRST HALF IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS JETS TEAM WANTED TO SEE. EIGHT FIRST DOWNS IN THE FIRST QUARTER ALONE. THE MOST SINCE GOING BACK TO 2021. AARON RODGERS IN COMPLETE COMMAND. AL: FLAG IS DOWN FOR THE MOMENT ON THE EXTRA POINTS, WHICH WAS GOOD. AND IT'S AGAINST THE PATE ROTES. OK. SO YOU COULD GO FOR TWO BUT I THINK THEY WILL TET SETTLE FOR FOR ONE WITH 8:30 TO GO. HERE'S HUSSEY. CONDUCT. RECEIVING TEAM, NUMBER 23. THE NEW YORK JETS HAVE ELECTED TO PUT THAT 15-YARD PENALTY ON THE KICKOFF. AL: OK. HERE IT IS AGAIN. IT'S DUGGER. KIRK: ELEVATES, THAT'S WE'RE TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE JETS HERE. HOW CAN NEW ENGLAND? THIS GAME COULD NOT HAVE GONE THIS WAY. THEY'VE BEEN CONTROLLING KIND OF THE TEMPO OF GAMES THE GAMES. THEY BEAT CINCINNATI, AND NOW TONIGHT THE GAME IS GETTING AWAY FROM THEM. AL: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT RODGERS AND THE FACT HE LOVES THE PROCESS. HE LOVES TO BUILD THE FOUNDATION. IT'S SUCH IN CONTRAS TO BRETT FAVRE, COVERED A TON OF HIS GAMES AND TOWARD THE END OF HIS CAREER SAID I COULD PLAY UNTIL 60. I DON'T WANT TO PRACTICE, I DON'T ENJOY IT. BRETT WANTED TO PLAY AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD THEN GO OUT AND PLAY NINE HOLES. KIRK: HE'S STARTING TO LOOK AT ADJUSTMENTS THEY MIGHT NEED TO MAKE. 193 YARDS OF OFFENSE. ALMOST 17 MINUTES IN TIME OF POSSESSION. PATRIOTS HAVE 12 YARDS OF OFFENSE HERE IN THIS FIRST HALF. AL: LASTY BRINGS IT UP TO THE 24. -- HASTY BRINGS IT UP KIRK: WE'VE SEEN HACKETT FIXING UP PERSONNEL GROUPINGS. RODGERS HAS BEEN ON FIRE TONIGHT FIRE TON TONIGHT, 12-14. SHOWING THE ATHLETIC ABILITY AND THE FACT THAT THE A.C. LEAGUES HAS RECOVERED. A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING. THE YARDS AFTER THE CATCH, 113 YARDS AFTER THE CATCH OF 135 A LOT OF THAT IS HIS ACCURACY AND A LOT OF THAT IS THESE GUYS BREAKING TACKLERS FROM WOULD BE TACKLES. AND A RUN TO THE OUTSIDE. STEVENSON TACKLED THERE BY D.J. REED. TO KAYLEE. KAYLEE: YOU SAW JABRILL PEPPERS LIMP OFF THE FIELD EARLIER. HE WAS IN THE TENT PROSECUTOR 8:30 AND NOW WE'RE TOLD HE'S QUESTIONABLE TO RETURN BECAUSE OF AN ANKLE AL: THEY SURE DON'T NEED THAT THEY'RE MINUS BENTLEY ALREADY. STEVENSON NOW BREAKING A TACKLE. THERE HE GOES TOWARD MIDFIELD AND DRAGGED DOWN AT THE 47-YARD LINE AND A FLAG IS AND THE PATRIOTS ARE STARTING TO -- THEY'RE HANGING AROUND FOR A MOMENT HOPING IT'S ON DEFENSE. HOWEVER, HERE IT IS AGAIN. WELL, THERE'S THE FLAG. REFEREE: PERSONAL FOUL, FACEMASK, OFFENSE, NUMBER 3. THAT 15-YARD PENALTY WILL BE ENFORCED FROM THE SPOT OF THE FOUL, SECONDS DOWN. AL: THAT'S A PINKIE AROUND MASK. KIRK: JUST WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE YOU FINALLY, FINALLY GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A STEP FORWARD WITH IT, THEY WENT INTO THAT JUMBO LOOK WITH ZACH THOMAS AND AN EXTRA OFFENSIVE LINEMEN, WENT HEAVY TO THE RIGHT AND THEY DOUBLE-TEAMED. HE WAS PATIENT AND NOTRE DAME FOUND A HOME. NOT ONLY DOES HE GET A FACEMASK BUT NOW HE'S ON SIDELINE WITH THE TRAINERS CHECKING HIM OUT. AL: RAINING AND POURING RIGHT NOW ON OFFENSE, DEFENSE. THEY BRING MANY ANTONIO GIBSON. HAD A BIG GAME SUNDAY AT TENNESSEE. COMES IN HERE AFTER THE FACEMASK ON A SECOND DOWN AND 9. BRISSETT FIRES AND THAT WILL BE NOT CAUGHT AND ANOTHER FLAG COMES IN. AFTER THE INCOMPLETE PASS AND THIS TIME THE JETS ARE STARTING TO MOVE BACK. TWO FLAG? S, THREE FLAGS. REFEREE: UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS. KIRK: IT WAS SHERWOOD WHO WAS PLAYING A LOT TONIGHT BECAUSE MOSLEY IS OUT. LOWERS THAT HEAD AND MAKES CONTACT WILL. TWO DIFFERENT OFFICIALS CAME IN. AL: THAT'S A HARD DENY KIRK: IT IS. IT IS BANG-BANK PLAY. AS A DEFENDER YOU'RE SAYING WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO. HE LED WITH SUPPORT. AL: FLIP TO DEMARIO DOUGLAS. BRAKE A TACKLE. TO THE MIDFIELD TRIPE AND CLOSE TO A FIRST KIRK: A LITTLE MISDIRECTION. THEY USED HIM THERE TO FAKE LIKE THEY WERE GOING TO RUN IT TO THE RIGHT. A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO GET A RUNNING BACK WITH SOME SPEED OUT INTO THE OPEN SPACE. BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME PEOPLE MISS. AL: SECOND AND INCHES. AND YOU SAW THE ALERT AND THE ALERT GET TO THAT TIME IT WAS CHUCK CLARK. REFEREE: FORWARD PROGRESS IS STOPPED. THIRD DOWN. AL:: IT WAS CLARK AND DEDE COMES IN, ALMOST UNTOUCHED AND. GUARD PROGRESS -- THIRD AND. KIRK: DID A HECK OF A JOB OF SITTING WAY BACK AND DICING WHEN THAT PRESSURE WAS COMING WITH THE MOTION THAT TIME FROM HUNTER HENRY COMING FROM THE RIGHT TO THE LEFT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT FOR THE OFFENSE TO BE ABLE TO SEE THAT TO BE ABLE TO PICK THAT UP. AL: CLARK'S FIRST SACK IN THREE SEASONS. THIRD AND 9. GOING DEEP AND INCOMPLETE AND CONTACT IS THERE AND THREE MORE FLAGS COME IN. TYQUAN THORNTON THE INTENDED RECEIVER. E.J. REFED WHO MISSED LAST WEEK'S GAME. IN TENNESSEE WITH A KNEE INJURY AND THIS IS GOING TO BENEFIT THE PUTT ROSS. -- PATRIOTS. KIRK: GRABBED THAT ARM AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH THAT BUT THEN HE GOT PHYSICAL WITH BODY. THAT'S WHEN THE FLAG CAME IN. AL: THE OFFICIALS HAVE EYES EVERYWHERE. THE SECOND PENALTY IN A ROW WHERE THREE FLAGS CAME IN FOR EMPHASIS. 43-YARD PENALTY. SO THE PATRIOTS IN DIRE NEED OF A BREAK AND GOT ONE THERE. "60 MINUTES" UNTIL THE HALF. AGAIN THE ALERT. COMES IN FROM THE OTHER SIDE AS WELL AND NOTHING BUT GREEN SHIRTS ARE THERE AND WILL MCDONALD. LAST YEAR THE NUMBER ONE DRAFT CHOICE PICKED 15TH OVERALL OUT OF IOWA STATE. A HAT TRICK LAST WEEK AND ONE AND A HALF TONIGHT NOW. KIRK: WE KNOW HIS POTENTIAL. USED TO JUST BE A SPEED OUTSIDE GUY AS A ROOKIE BUT WITH JERMAINE JOHNSON DOWN HE IS STEPPING UP TONIGHT, MAKING SOME BIG PLAYS. AL: A LITTLE FLIP NO ROOM TO ROAM. GIBSON IS TACKLED. SHEWOOD MAKES THE STOP. THIRD DOWN AND 18 FOR NEW ENGLAND. DEFENSE THAT USUALLY DOESN'T BLITZ. THEY RELY ON THE FRONT BUT THEY'VE COME OUT TONIGHT AGAINST THIS INEXPERIENCED OFFENSIVELY LINE AND DECIDED TO CRANK UP THE PRESSURE AND IT'S REALLY WORKED OUT. AL: JEFF ULBRICL THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR. HE WAS IN SAN FRANCISCO PRIOR TO THIS. SPINNING HIS WAY TO THE 24-YARD LINE IS GIBSON TO SET UP WHAT BE ABOUT A 43-YARD FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT AND THERE IS THE INJURED C.J. MOSLEY. GOOD NEWS IS HE WAS THOUGHT TO BE MAYBE EVEN A GAMETIME DECISION TONIGHT. THEY'RE GOING TO REST HIM 10 GAMES BEFORE THE NEXT GAME. KIRK: THE LEADER OF THE DEFENSE. AL: JOEY SLYE, 44-YARD ATTEMPT. CARDONA, LONG-TIME SNAPPER AND THE AL: NEXT THU NIGHT WE'RE RIGHT BACK HERE AT THE MEADOWLANDS. IT'S THE DALLAS COWBOY S AND THE NEW YORK GIANTS. THE COWBOYS 1-1. THE GIANTS STARTED 0-2. THEY'RE IN CLEVELAND. KICKOFF, 8:00 P.M. EASTERN. MIGHT AS WELL PITCH A TENT. KIRK: YOU CAN JUST STAY HERE OR GO ALL THE WAY BACK THE OTHER DIRECTION. AL: TO BE DETERMINED BUT IT'S ALREADY BEEN DETERMINED. ANYWAY, BIG NIGHT FOR THE JETS FANS HERE. SEE ABOUT THE GIANTS NEXT WEEK. WITH 3:56 TO GO IN THE FIRST HALF AND THEY'RE GOING TO RUN THIS BACK. THIS IS ISAIAH DAVIS COMING BACK. BACK TO THE 25-YARD LOOK AT THIS THING KIRK: PRETTY AMAZING. YOU LOOK WHAT THEY'VE DONE TONIGHT AND COMPARE THAT TO LAST SIX FIRST DOWNS ON EACH OF THE LAST TWO LAST YEAR, SIX-PLUS FIRST DOWNS ON TWO OF 208 DRIVES. AL: AMAZING. WHAT A DIFFERENCE A GOOD ACHILLES OPERATION CAN MAKE, RIGHT? WOW. I MENTIONED BEFORE HE HAD A CHANCE TO COME BACK AT THE END OF LAST SEASON BUT THEY WERE OUT OF PLAYOFF CONTENTION AND THEY SHUT HIM DOWN. LOOK OUT. BREAKING A TACKLE IS ALLEN SO HE TURNS A LOSS INTO NO GAIN. BOUCHER HAD COULDN'T SECURE HIM. AL: THE OFFENSIVE LINE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB. HERE HE GET RUCKERT. HE'S ABLE TO USE HIS QUICKNESS, GET INSIDE OF HIM. PHYSICALITY OF BRAELON ALLEN, USING THOSE STRONG LEGS SO INSTEAD OF A MINUS THREE, PUTS HIM AT SECOND AND 9 POWERFUL. AL: HALL AND ALLEN BOTH IN THE BACKFIELD. GOES IN MOTION, ALLEN TAKES THE HAND OFF ON INSIDE, BRINGS IT OUT TO THE 30-YARD LINE, THIRD DOWN AND 4. KIRK: THIS IS A BIG THREE MINUTES LEFT IN REMEMBER, NEW ENGLAND DEFERRED ASK THEY GET THE BALL TO START THE SECOND HALF. AARON RODGERS IS POINTS. THEY'RE THINKING WE HAVE A CHANCE TO GET A STOP, MAYBE GET POINTS AND THEN GET THE BALL THE SECOND HALF. BIG SEQUENCE COMING AL: TWO FOR ONE. BIG THIRD DOWN HERE. KIRK: THIS IS WHERE HE'S SO DANGEROUS. LOOKING FOR THAT MATCHUP. HE GET THOSE FREE PLAYS. REFEREE: FALSE START, OFFENSE, NUMBER 7. FIVE-YARD PENALTY, AL: SO THE JETS HAVE GAINED 199 YARDS. THE PATRIOTS 88 AT THIS POINT. JETS ARE ABOUT READY TO RUN THEIR 31ST PLAY OF THE HALF. KIRK: SEEMS LIKE PENALTIES ARE THE ONLY THING SLOWING THE JETS AL: 28 YARDS FOR THE PATRIOTS, CORRECTION. TWO GUYS ON THE ALERT. NEITHER COMES THIS TIME AND RODGERS GOES DEEP AND FINDS THE OPEN MAN AT THE 47-YARD LINE. TYLER CONKLIN. NEEDED NINE, GOT 22. KIRK: HOW ABOUT THE EYES? HE WANTS TO TO THE MILE. HE LOOKS TO THE LEFT TO MOVE THE SAFETY IT COST THEM A YARD SO THEY BRING IT BACK, SECOND AND 2. IT ALSO REQUIRES A 10-SECOND RUNOFF UNLESS A TEAM WANTS TO CALL A TIME-OUT. NEW ENGLAND SAYS WE'LL TAKE THE 10 SECONDS OFF THE CLOCK SO THE CLOCK IS NOW AT 1:44 KIRK: YOU SEE THE JETS AND AARON RODGERS WHO HAVE BEEN IN COMMAND. STILL THE THREE TIME-OUTS. OBVIOUSLY A SHOT TO GET INTO FIELD GOAL RANGE. THEY'RE PROBABLY THINKING ABOUT TRYING TO GET ANOTHER TOUCHDOWN ON THE BOARD THE WAY THEY'VE BEEN PLAYING AND EXECUTE PLAYING AND EXECUTING. 2. RODGERS, 13-15, 157, A LOT OF YARDS AFTER THE CATCH. WHAT'S HE GOT IN MIND ON A SECOND AND A DEUCE? HARD COUNT. TO THE 42-YARD LINE GOES BREECE HALL SO GETS FIRST DOWN. KIRK: I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE CAN TELL THIS AT HOME BUT THE BALL IS COMING OUT OF AARON RODGERS' HANDS DIFFERENTLY TONIGHT THAN WE'VE ALL SEEN IN A LONG TIME. HE'S A GREAT PLAYER, WE KNOW ALL THAT BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE VELOCITY, SPIN. HE IS IN A ZONE RIGHT NOW AND THE BALL HAS BEEN RIGHT ON THE MONEY EVERY SINGLE TIME. LOOKS LIKE OLD AARON RODGERS TONIGHT. A. AL: FOR SURE. UNDER A MINUTE. GOOD MOVE BY HALL, TAKES IT TO THE 35 SO. JETS WITH3 THEY CAN RUN THE CLOCK ALL THE WAY DOWN. THEY CAN SCORE AT AL: ROUGH HALF FOR THE PATRIOTS GREAT TO HAVE THE JETS OFFENSE, 46 SECONDS. IT IS SECOND DOWN AND 2. KIRK: YOU HAVE A FEELI TAKE A SHOT. WHY NOT SECOND AND GEORGE TRY TO MAKE THAT PLAY? AL: PEPPERS WENT BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM, SO THE SECONDARY DEPLETED, AND AARON RODGERS TAKING THE SHOT. TOO FAR. ANOTHER FLAG IS DOWN AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. WILSON FREED DOWN THE SIDELINE. REFEREE: OFFENSE YARD PENALTY, SECOND DOWN. KIRK: HE GOT LAZY. THESE ARE THE THINGS WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AARON RODGERS. YOU DO THE LITTLE THINGS RIGHT, IT CAN TAKE YOU TO ANOTHER LEVEL. THE EMOTION, HE STARTS TO GO FORWARD TO BEFORE THE BALL IS SNAPPED. IF HE ENDS UP PITTING THIS FOR A TOUCHDOWN, THE PLAY COMES BACK, AND AARON IS CHALLENGING WILSON TO LEARN TO TAKE THAT STEP IS A THIRD-YEAR PLAY. RIDICULOUS TALENT AND SKILL SET, BUT HE IS CHALLENGING HIM TO DO THE MENTAL ASPECT OF THE GAME, AND AARON WILL IMPACT HIS CAREER. AL: EVERYBODY UPTIGHT THERE. ALAN FLARES MAKES THAT CATCH. BOUCHER MAKING THE STOP THERE. IT IS THIRD DOWN, AT AND 5. WE WILL TAKE A TIMEOUT. TIMEOUT. AL: ROBERT KRAFT IS IN H HE BOUGHT THIS TEAM BACK IN 1994. THERE HE IS WITH HIS SON JONATHAN KRAFT. HAS WATCH THIS TEAM GO TO 10 SUPER BALLS AND WIN SIX OF THEM. NINE SUPER BOWL'S AND SIX TOO WINS UNDER BELLA CHECK. BUT THE TEAM FOR LESS THAN $200 MILLION. YOU KNOW WHO TRIED TO BUY THE TEAM? JEFF LURIE. KRAFT WON THE BID, SO HER EAGLES. KIRK: BOTH WORKED WELL. I WAS DOWN THERE ON THE FIELD ANY COMES UP AND STARTS TALKING. DO YOU WANT TO COME SAY HELLO TO MY GUY? WE WILL HEAD UP TOGETHER? AL: HE MAKES THE ROUNDS. AT DOWN AND 5. PRESSURE, CAUGHT MIDDLE. MIKE WILLIAMS TO THE 20 YARD LINE, SO IF THIRD DOWN AND 5. NEW YORK NOW TAKES A TIMEOUT. THEIR FINAL. KIRK: VERY RISKY TO BRING THIS PRESSURE HERE, BECAUSE OF THE OPENING RIGHT HERE, AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE AARON RODGERS WANTS TO GO. BRUCE ROGERS DID A GOOD JOB OF STEPPING UP. SO GOOD TO SEE WILLIAM ZUBAC FOR THE 2023 SEASON. THEY WERE TO BACK EARLY AGAIN SAN FRANCISCO WITH THE NINE SNAPS LAST WEEK. A LOT MORE WITH 35, AND IF HE KEEPS COMING ALONG I THINK THAT IS THE THIRD OPTION ALONG WITH THE TWO BACKS IN THE BACKFIELD THEY CAN MAKE THIS OFFENSE DANGEROUS TO STOP. AL: 15.5 AVERAGE PER CATCH, SO HE IS THE HOME RUN HITTER. OUTSIDE AND INCOMPLETE, SO THE SECONDARY DOES ITS JOB DEEP. DUGGER COVERS ON THE PLAY, SECOND AND 10. KIRK: DEBATE THING WITH THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, YOU ARE GOING UP AGAINST AARON RODGERS. THE BIG THING WE HAVE TO DO IS POST SNAP MOVEMENT. IF HE KNOWS WHAT YOU ARE IN, YOU WERE DEAD. IT IS TOUGH TONIGHT BECAUSE YOU SEE AARON RODGERS IN THIS GROOVE BEING GOOD, SEEING THE FIELD WELL, BUT THAT WAS ONE OF THE FEW TIMES A NIGHT WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO DO MOVEMENT LATE, AND IT IMPACTED THE FLOW AND RHYTHM OF AARON RODGERS AND THE RECEIVERS. AL: RUSH, AARON RODGERS SURVEYS, GOING FORWARD, AND THROWS ABOUT ONE OUT OF THE BACK OF THE END THE SECONDARY MINUS PEPPERS AT THE MOMENT DOING ITS JOB, AND AARON LEADING HIS CASE WITH MUSSEY, WHY DID A PENALTY AND WILL NOT GET ONE. KIRK: I THINK HE SAW SOME CONTACT DOWNFIELD. REFEREE: THERE IS NO INTENTIONAL GROUND. THE BALL WENT OVER HIS HEAD. KIRK: AT THAT ONE TIMEOUT WITH 14 SECONDS LEFT. AL: BUT IF YOU KEEP IT IN THE FIELD OF PLAY, YOU CANNOT SPIKE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE FOURTH DOWN IF YOU DO NOT GIVE AT LEAST 10, AND NOBODY KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN AARON WHAT HE HAS TO DO, AND ZONE OR SIDELINE. EVERYTHING ELSE DANGEROUS. HE HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE. HE KNOWS. 3RD AND 10. AND NOW YOU HAVE GOT A TIMEOUT BY THE PATRIOTS. REFEREE: TIMEOUT BY NEW ENGLAND. THIS WILL BE A YEAR. NOT OPOSSUM OUT THERE IN MANHATTAN TONIGHT RUNNING AROUND WITH ALL OF THE RATS MAYOR ADAMS IS TRYING TO GET RID OF. THIRD DOWN AND 10. RODGERS TO THE OUTSIDE, AND THAT IS INCOMPLETE. SO IT IS FOURTH DOWN, AND THAT WILL BRING IN ZERO LINE -- ZURLINE TO MAKE IT AN ADVANTAGE. GREG ZUERLEIN, 13 YEARS IN THE LEAGUE. TELL YOU WHAT, HE KICKED ONE OF THE MOST CLUTCH FIELD GOALS. WITH THE RAMS IN OVERTIME, LIKE A 61 YARDER TO GIVE THEM THE ROAD TO THE SUPER BOWL. OTHERWISE NEW ORLEANS THAT DAY HAD A FIRST DOWN AND 2 AND THEY GO TO THE SUPER BOWL. GREG ZUERLEIN, AND THIS TIME HE MISSES. GREG ZUERLEIN AT THE END OF THAT DRIVE CANNOT TACK ON THREE AND THE JETS SETTLE FOR AN 11 POINT MARGIN. KIRK: HE JUST MISSES THIS. HOOKING FACT OF THE LEFT SO THE PATRIOTS CATCH A BREAK HERE. THINKING ABOUT TRYING TO STOP AARON RODGERS FROM PUTTING SIX ON THE BOARD, THEN THEY SETTLE FOR 3 AND THEY END UP GETTING OUT OF HERE 14-3. GETTING THE BALL TO START THE SECOND HALF, THAT WIN FOR NEW ENGLAND. AL: YEAH, THEY GET THE BALL TO START THE SECOND HALF. AND 7 TICKS LEFT. OF COURSE THAT IS GOING TO THROW, AND THEY WILL CALL A TIMEOUT HERE AND DO SOMETHING. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT. DEMARIO DOUGLAS MADE THE CATCH. WITHIN THE INEXPERIENCED OFFENSE KIRK: WITH THE INEXPERIENCED OFFENSE, THE JETS USUALLY RELI PRESSURE, BUT HERE IS CHUCK CLARK COMING. THEY BROUGHT A NUMBER OF EVEN THE BLITZ FROM THE LEFT FREES UP AND GETS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MCDONALD TO GET IN THERE FREE BECAUSE OF THE BRIDGE OF THE GAME FROM INSIDE, SO REALLY GOOD JOB OF CREATING SOME CONFUSION BY JEFF ALDRICH, WHO IS THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR AND CHANGING UP SOME LOOKS. ADJUSTMENTS. AL: IF THEY LAUNCH A HAIL MARY, THE JETS HAVE THREE DEFENDERS AT THE GOAL LINE. TRIES TO FIND TIME, LAUNCHES IT INTO THE ENDZONE, AND A LOT OF ACTION BACK THERE AND KNOCKED AWAY. JONI ADAMS -- TONY BETTING IT DOWN. SO THE JETS, 252 YARDS IN THE FIRST HALF, AND THE PATRIOTS WERE HELD TO 40. KAYLEE: THAT LAST DRIVE MIGHT NOT HAVE ENDED THE WAY HE WANTED TO, BUT WE HAVE SEEN AARON RODGERS EFFECTIVE INTERNET OF THE POCKET. WHAT IMPRESSED YOU MOST ABOUT YOUR OFFENSE? >> WE HAVE BEEN GETTING IN AND OUT OF THE HUDDLE, GETTING THE BALL REALLY WELL, RUNNING THIRD DOWNS. WE HAVE GOT TO KEEP THAT GOING. KAYLEE: YOU TOLD US YOU' KAYLEE: YOU TOLD US YOU'VE EXPECTED TO GUYS TO STEP UP EVEN WITH KEY DEFENSIVE INJURIES THAT YOU WOULD BEEN DOING. HOW IF THEY BEEN ABLE TO KEEP BRINGING THE PRESSURE UP FRONT? >> RELENTLESS. OUR D-LINE IS DEEP. WE SET THE STANDARD ON THE DEFENSIVE LINE TO KEEP GOING. AL:FAN, COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF WHA YOU WOULD HOPE TO SEE. CONTROL THE CLOCK. THE GAME GOT AWAY FROM THEM THE WAY AARON RODGERS HAVE BEEN PLAYING, SO YOU HAVE GOT TO GET BACK TO -- YOU LOOK AT THOSE NUMBERS AND THINK THEY ARE DONE BY THREE POSSESSIONS. IF YOU CAN PUT IT DRIVE TOGETHER HERE, PUT POINTS ON THE BOARD, YOU ARE RIGHT THERE. IT IS A MATTER OF ADJUSTING TO THE PRESSURE THE JETS HAVE DIALED UP AND GET THE OFFENSIVE LINE T THE SECOND HALF. AL: CAN THEY? START FROM THE 30. FIELD. KAYLEE: THE JETS DEFENSE IS BROUGHT PRESSURE AGAINST WERE MAKESHIFT O-LINE. >> IT IS ALL ABOUT FUNDAMENTALS. THOSE GUYS HAVE GOT TO PLAY BETTER. JUST AS A TEAM, IT GOES BACK TO FUNDAMENTALS. KAYLEE: HOW DO YOU RODGERS OUT OF HIS RHYTHM? >> DEFENSE HAS BEEN OUT THERE A LONG TIME. HE IS PINPOINT RIGHT NOW. WE JUST HAVE TO SPEND THE DIAL. AL: WE START FROM THE 30 YARD LINE. 19 YARDS, AND NOT A GOOD BEGINNING FOR THESE GUYS. MCDONALD'S IS RIGHT THERE BREAKING THROUGH. KIRK: THE PROBLEM YOU HAVE IS WHEN YOU DO NOT HAVE A THREAT DUNFIELD, THE LINEBACKERS DO NOT RESPECT ANYTHING, SO THEY ARE FLYING DOWNHILL. THERE IS NO FEAR AT ALL. IT IS SOMETHING NEW ENGLAND WILL HAVE TO GROW INTO. MCDONALD DID A GOOD JOB OF COLLAPSING DOWN TO THE RIGHT. WATCHING THESE LINEBACKERS. AROUND? NO WAY. AL: THERE IS THE DEFENSIVE ALERT , IN THE POCKET HE STANDS, AND THE BALL IS CAUGHT AT THE 36 YARD LINE BY JAILING COAL -- JAYLEN COLT, THIRD DOWN AND 5. KIRK: RESET -- BRISSETT STANDING BY TWO ROOKIES. HE WAS ON THE PRACTICE SQUAD AND THEY OPEN TO SEIZING AGAIN CINCINNATI. HE IS STARTING TO NINE FIRST CAREER STARTED LEFT TACKLE. BIRSSETT IS STANDING IN THEIR BEING A MAN KNOWING THERE IS PRESSURE. AL: HERE COMES THE BLITZ. IT PASSES INCOMPLETE. TOO MUCH PRESSURE, AND DOWN HE GOES. YOU HAVE GOT BRISSETT GOING DOWN, THE BACK UP. HE WILL IN ALL THERE QUARTERBACK IN THE FUTURE. KIRK: HERE COMES THE PRESSURE. AGAINST THIS OFFENSIVE LINE THEY ARE DIALING UP BECAUSE THERE IS NO TIME FOR THE RECEIVE THE SEPARATION ON THAT THIRD DOWN PLAY. AL: SO A REAL FAST THREE AND OUT. BARINGER'S PUNT, FIELDED, GIBSON. 20, 30. STOPPED AT THE 33 YARD LINE AND ROGERS -- AARON RODGERS, THE OLDEST ACTIVE PLAYER IN THE NFL. WILL BE 41 IN DECEMBER. CAN HE LEAD THE JETS TO THE PROMISED LAND? OR AT LEAST TO THE WILD-CARD ROUND. BACK FROM THE 34 YARD LINE. GIVE IT TO HIM. AL: WE WERE DOWN ON THE FIELD BEFORE THE GAME, KIRK, AND FROM BEHIND AARON RODGERS, IT IS SO EASY, IT IS LIKE HE FLICKS THE REST AND HE GOES. KIRK: HE DOES. I TALKED TO HIM A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HIS TECHNIQUE, AND I SENT IT IS SO STRANGE. THE HEEL OF YOUR FOOT NEVER TOUCHES THE GROUND, AND HE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE NATURALLY HAS THIS ABILITY TO BRACE HIMSELF BUT HIS WHOLE GOAL IS TO KEEP HIS BODY WEIGHT BACK. HE DOES THAT IT IS ALMOST LIKE A KICKSTART, HE PUTS THE LEFTFIELD DOWN -- THAT'S THE VELOCITY ON THE FOOTBALL. AL: INTO THE BACKFIELD, HE RELEASED A SACK, HE WILL TAKE OFF, GO TO THE SIDELINE AND FIND IT, AND THE CYCLE CROSSES THE BOUNDARY OF KEY ON WHITE. HE IS FINE. HE SHAKES HIS HEAD. KIRK: IT IS FOOTBALL. I LOVED WHAT HE SAID ABOUT BEING 40 AND GETTING HIT LIKE THIS. THERE ARE SOME OF US TO PLAY IN THE BACKYARD AT 40 WITH OUR KIDS, AND YOUR LOWER BACK HURTS. HE SAID TOM USED TO TALK ABOUT THIS. AND IT IS NOT A LATE HIT. HE SAID I'M 40 YEARS OLD, BUT I HAVE A CHEF, I TAKE CARE OF MYSELF YEAR-ROUND. I FEEL BETTER AT 40 THAN I DID NOT TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. AL: MUCH LIKE BRADY. AND HE DRINKS AR EIGHT. THROUGH THE MIDDLE TO THE 50 KIRK: HE HAS LOOKED GREAT HE IS COMPLETING PASSES, HE IS LOOKING OFF DEFENDERS. HE'S HAD HELP. THE RECEIVERS ARE RUNNING GOOD ROUNDS, GUYS ARE MAKING PLAYS AFTER THE CATCH. BUT HE' BUT HE'S USING HIS EYES, WHAT HERE' HERE'S A GREAT CHOP READ HE'S COMING BACK TO THE RIGHT THE WHOLE TIME, BUT HE MOVES THE SAFETIES WERE HE WANTS SO HE CAN CREATE THAT SPACE TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO CATCH THE BALL AND GET DOWN TO PROTECT HIMSELF. AL: SECOND DOWN. HANDOFF. BRANDON ALLEN. COMES OFF A LITTLE BIT SHY OF THE FIRST BY INCHES. THIRD DOWN COMING UP. KIRK: HE WAS EXCITED TO BE BACK HOME, TO USE THAT HARD COUNT. A LOT OF TIMES HE USES IT, LAST TIME HE WAS DOWN IN NASHVILLE, AND NOW BACK HOME, HE TRIED IT A COUPLE OF TIMES EARLIER ON THE HARD COUNT, AND LET'S SEE IF HE TRIES A HERE ON THIRD AND 1. AL: THERE ARE THREE TIGHT ENDS, ALLEN IS THE RUNNING BACK. ON THIRD AND SHORT. TO THE OUTSIDE. AND THAT IS GOING TO BE HOLDING. INBOUND BY RUCKER. GOT THE FIRST DOWN. KIRK: I JUST LOVE -- I DON'T EVEN WANT TO TALK, I JUST WANT TO WATCH THIS. THIS IS WHY THE JETS FANS WERE DEVASTATED WHEN HE WENT DOWN ON THE FOURTH PLAY LAST YEAR. IT IS ONE THING TO MAKE PLAYS IN THE POCKET, BUT WHEN HE MAKES THEM OFF PLATFORM LIKE THIS AND THROWS AN ABSOLUTE ROPE ON THE OUTSIDE SHOULDER TO RUCKER, CREATING LIKE THAT, FEELING GOOD. IT IS BEAUTIFUL. AL: ALAN IS ON THE BACKFIELD. >> PRIOR TO THE DELAY OF GAME, FIRST CHARGED TIMEOUT, NEW YORK THIS WILL BE A 32ND TIMEOUT -- 32ND TIMEOUT. AL: JETS' FANS KNOW THE HISTORY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO REPEAT IT. NO PLAYOFFS FOR 13 YEARS, EIGHT STRAIGHT LOSING SEASONS. THE NUMBER ONE GAME IN THE HISTORY OF THE JETS WAS THE 1968 SEASON, SUPER BOWL THREE, A L TIME AGO.UPER BOWL THREE, A LONG KIRK: AND IT IS WEEK THREE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET CRAZY HERE, BUT YOU WATCH A LOT OF FOOTBALL, IT IS A YEAR WHERE OFFENSES ARE STRUGGLING, NOT SEEN THE NUMBERS WE NORMALLY SEE. YOU ARE JUST GOING TO KNOCK ON WOOD AND HOPE A ABLE TO STAY HEALTHY. HE STARTING TO SEE THE PIECES AROUND HIM. THE OFFENSIVE LINE WILL ONLY GET BETTER WITH THREE NEW PIECES. WILSON ON THE OUTSIDE, LAZARD, MIKE WILLIAMS, BREECE HALL, THERE IS A LOT TO THIS OFFENSE. AL: AND HERE IS THE ROOKIE ALLEN TO THE 38TH YARD LINE. THE LAST TIME THE JETS GOT TO THE PLAYOFFS, THEY GOT TO THE AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME TWO YEARS IN A ROW. BUT HE RYAN -- >> RYAN -- RYAN, BUT HE IS POPULAR, AND THAT'S THE LAST TIME THEY GOT TO THE PLAYOFFS. KIRK: WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF BRAELON ALLEN, MISSED PLAYS, COUPLE OF TOUCHDOWNS, SEEING HIM MORE TONIGHT. LOVE WHAT AARON RODGERS SAID ABOUT HIM. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT AFTER THIS PLAY. AL: SECOND AND 7. GOOD FAKE. PRESSURE IS ON. THROWS UNDERNEATH. CHECKS IT DOWN TO ALLEN, THIRD DOWN AND 3. KIRK: YOU HAVE THE YOUNGEST PLAYERS IN THE LEAGUE. WE TALKED ABOUT HIM AT A BEFORE, AND HE SAID, I KNEW ABOUT HIM WHEN HE WAS A FRESHMAN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN. I WAS A BIG FAN, AND WE ENDED UP DRAFTING HIM. HE SAID WHAT HE REALLY LOVES ABOUT HIM AS HE SITS IN FRONT OF HIM AT THE MEETINGS, TAKING NOTES, AND HE'S VERY MATURE FOR A GUY AS YOUNG AS HE IS AT 20 YEARS OLD. HE HAS BEEN BLOWN AWAY BY THE WANT INSIDE OF HIM. HE IS NOT SURPRISED HE'S PLAYING AL: ALLEN GREW UP WATCHING HIM. AARON RODGERS KEEPS HIS EYES DOWNFIELD, FIRES, FINDS THE MAN. THIS TIME IT IS THE TIGHT END, EXTENDS THE PLAY, ON THE MOVE, THROWING ON THE MONEY. KIRK: HOW MANY PLAYS HAS HE MADE TONIGHT ON THE RUN? WATCH THE RIGHT TACKLE HELP HIM. MORGAN MOSES. AARON RODGERS STEPS UP AND THEN MOSES PINS THAT PRESSURE AND NOW HE BREAKS OUTSIDE WITH THE ABILITY TO WAIT AND FIND THAT OPEN RECEIVER, AND HE IS AS DANGEROUS AS ANYBODY OUT THERE BECAUSE OF HOW QUICK THAT BALL GETS OUT AND HOW ACCURATE HE THROWS ON THE RUN, AND HE LOOKS GOOD IN THE HAT. AL: AS GOOD AS EVER. HIS LAST YEAR AT GREEN BAY WAS NOT THAT GOOD. HE HAD GONE ALL OF LAST YEAR EXCEPT FOR FOUR PLAYS. TONIGHT, BACK TO THE FUTURE. S HAD TO TAKE A SECOND TIMEOUT TO AVOID THE DELAY OF COULD BE SIGNIFICANT DOWN THE STRETCH OF THIS GAME GETS CLOSE OR CLOSER. 16 YARD LINE. QUARTER. RODGERS TO THE OUTSIDE. AND TACKLED AT THE 10 YARD LINE. KIRK: LAST WEEK, THEY GO TO THAT SAME FORMATION, PUT BREECE HALL OUT THERE, WALKED OUT, MADE A PLEA, THIS TIME WITH SOFT COVERAGE FROM ANOTHER LINEBACKER. RUNNING THE FOOTBALL TO GET SIX, INSTEAD, LET'S RUN IT TO BREECE HALL, GET SOME POSITIVE YARDS. THAT PACKAGE WILL B TEAMS HAVE TO DEFEND EVERY WEEK WITH RODGERS ABILITY TO FIND CATCH UP. AL: SECOND AND 4, TO THE OUTSIDE. GOOD MOVE. TACKLED AT THE TWO. GARRETT WILSON TAKEN DOWN BY JONES TO SAVE THE TOUCHDOWN. FIRST AND GOAL. KIRK: YOU THINK ABOUT HIM WITH HIS BODY CONTROL DOWNFIELD TAKING PLACE, BUT WITH SOFT COVERAGE LIKE THAT, GETTING IT TO HIM IN A HURRY, HE IS JUST AS DANGEROUS AFTER THE CATCH. WE HAVE SEEN THAT THEME REPEATING. THE NEW YORK JETS RECEIVERS TAKING PLACE WITH ACCURATE THROWS FROM AARON RODGERS AND HE HAS GOT LIVE LEGS, TOUCHDOWN. AL: CHRISTIAN GONZALEZ, FIRST AND GOAL. RODGERS, A THROW, CAUGHT, STAYING INBOUND. YES, TOUCHDOWN. KIRK: THERE IS GARRETT WILSON'S FIRST TOUCHDOWN WE WILL BE SEEING A LOT OF THAT. EIGHT TO FIVE. HOW ABOUT THIS THROW? GONZALEZ ROLLS THE DICE, INKING ABOUT GETTING HIS TEAM BACK IN THE GAME. JUMPSUIT. IF HE DOES, HE MAYBE HAS A CHANCE, BUT THAT BALL IS ABOUT TO BE A BROKEN RECORD. PERFECTLY THROWN TO THE OUTSIDE, AWAY FROM THE DEFENDER AND THERE IS THAT BODY CONTROL TALKED ABOUT WITH GARRETT AL: THE POINT AFTER IS GOOD, SO AFTER THE PASS, THE JETS GO DOWNFIELD, 66 YARDS, THEY LEAD BY 18. -- HON -- HOYUNDAI. RUN FOR 16 YARDS, ERIC WILSON JUST MADE THAT TOUCHDOWN GRAB. 25 YARDS ON FOUR CATCHES. THREE POINTS, 46 TOTAL YARDS FOR THE PATS OFFENSE, AND THE JETS HAVE GAINED THE HUNDRED 18 YARDS TO 46 FOR NEW ENGLAND. 21-3 IS THE SCORE. AND THE KICK OFF. SO, FOR THE PATRIOTS,. MAYO WAS A TOP 10 PICK BACK WHEN HE CAME OUT OF COLLEGE. YOU HAVE SEEN HIM A LOT. YOUR TAKE ON MAY? KIRK: HE'S GOT A BRIGHT FUTURE. I LOVE THE FACT THAT HE'S HAD A CHANCE TO SIT AFTER GETTING THROWN INTO THE FIRE. WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF YOUNG QUARTERBACKS, ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR -- AL: GETTING OPEN THAT TIME IS DOUGLAS. I'M AERIAL DOUGLAS. PRESSURE PUT UP BY JAELON HUNG IN THERE. KIRK: A GOOD TOP BY THE ROOKIE, LEFT TACKLE. JUST GETS THAT BALL OFF. THERE IS THE SEPARATION. IT IS GOOD TO SEE DOUGLAS GET A CHANCE TO GET HIS HANDS ON A FOOTBALL, ONE OF THE MOR ELECTRIFYING THREATS THEY HAVE ON THE PERIMETER. AL: ACTION AND PRESSURE AGAIN. SETS UP THE SCREEN. LOOPER, THE TIGHT END RUMBLES ALL THE WAY INSIDE 29 YARD LINE. KIRK: IT IS GOOD TO SEE THAT SCREEN. IT IS A GREAT ANSWER TO ONE LAST THING ON DRAKE ANYBODY WHO HAS WATCHED HIM PLAY, HE HAS THAT IT FACTOR, ATHLETIC FAMILY, DAD PLAYED IN COLLEGE, CHAMPIONSHIP IN NORTH CAROLINA, A GREAT TEAMMATE, AND A GUY WHO UNDERSTANDS HIS ROLE RIGHT NOW. YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE QUARTERBACKS WHO HAD TO SIT BACK AND WAIT, AARON LOVE. AL: RODGERS KNOWS THAT ALL TOO WELL, THREE YEARS. MEANWHILE, THAT BALL IS CAUGHT AT THE 25. KAYLEE: DRAKE WAS RUNNING A SCOUT TEAM IN PRACTICE, PRACTICING, ANDREWS TOLD ME THAT HE SAW A ROOKIE AND BRACING HIS ROLE IN ASKING RIGHT QUESTIONS PER HE APPRECIATES THE EFFORT HE PUT IN, SPECIFICALLY HOW HE LEARNED THE FIELD. AL: THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE. INTENDED THAT TIME FOR THORTON. THE INTERESTING THING IS MOST QUARTERBACKS, THE NUMBER ONE GUY WILL GET 90, 95% OF THE SNAPS, THE OTHER GUY, FIVE OR 10. THEY GO 70 30, BUT MAY HAS SEEN 30%. KIRK: THAT IS THE WAY THAT THEY FEEL THAT THEY WILL ALLOW HIM TO DEVELOP, AND HE'S ALSO GETTING THOSE LIVE REPS AGAINST FIRST-TEAM DEFENSE. SO THAT ALSO HELPS THEM. A BIG THIRD DOWN HERE FOR THIS AL: A GOOD START TO THE DRIVE. HE PULLS IT DOWN, FIRING, AND THAT IS INCOMPLETE. HE HAD A FLAG DOWN HERE AS DEMARIO DOUGLAS WAS THE INTENDED RECEIVER. THERE'S ALSO A FLAG IN THE OFFENSIVE ACT FIELD, SO YOU HAVE ONE IN THE SECONDARY AND ONE IN THE OFFENSIVE BACKFIELD. >> THERE ARE TWO VOWELS ON THE PLAY, ONE BY EACH TEAM. HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER 60. PASS INTERFERENCE, DEFENSE, NUMBER 30. WE PLAY, THIRD DOWN. AL: ANDREWS ON ONE SIDE, CARTER ON THE OTHER. BACK WHERE THERE DOWN. KIRK: WILLIAMS COMES RIGHT OVER THE MIDDLE OF THIS OFFENSE, A GOOD MATCHUP. THAT IS A TOUGH ASK FOR ANDREWS. A GREAT PLAYER WHO HAS BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME. THAT TIME, A HOLDING CALL, HE GIVES INTO THE POWER. I DID NOT SEE ANY INTERFERENCE AT ALL. AL: BACK TO A THIRD AND 4. ROLLING, LAST TIME, HERE GOES ANOTHER FLAG. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT NORMALLY MEANS. YOU SEE THAT KIND OF A FLAG, IT IS ALWAYS OFFENSIVE HOLDING. KIRK: LEFT TACKLE HERE. >> HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER 70. THIRD DOWN. KIRK: FOR PEOPLE JUST TUNING IN, HE'S MAKING HIS FIRST CAREER START AGAINST THIS DEFENSE AND DOING OK, THAT TIME ON A BIG HE ENDS UP GETTING BEAT TO THE INSIDE, USING THAT RIGHT HAND TO THROW THE DEFENDER DOWN. THIS GUY HAD 40 CAREER STARTS IN COLLEGE AT PENN STATE READ THE TIME PROGRAM, GREAT PLAYER, NEVER PLAYED LEFT TACKLE, AND HERE HE IS MAKING HIS START TONIGHT, NFL, FIRST CAREER START ON THE LEFT SIDE. AL: FOUR MEN RUSH HERE. DOWN HE GOES, THE FLAG GOES DOWN. WILLIAMS GOT TO HIM, SLOAN NEEDS ASSISTANCE IN GETTING UP. AND A PENALTY TO BOOTH. THAT PENALTY IS DECLINED. FOURTH DOWN. AL: A DOUBLE. KIRK: THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BRING THE BLITZ, BUT THEY DO A NICE STUNT HERE WITH THE BIG MAN BRINGING HIM AROUND, TRYING TO CONFUSE THAT OFFENSIVE NOBODY PICKS HIM UP. AL: WILLIAMS WILL GET A SACK, AND HE WILL GET SENT DOWN. DOWN BY CONTACT. THAT MAKES IT FOURTH DOWN AND A INSTEAD OF GETTING A POTENTIAL FIELD GOAL RANGE, NOTHING DOING ON THAT COUNT RIGHT NOW. BEHRINGER WITH HIS FOURTH PUNT OF THE NIGHT. FOURTH AND 26. KIRK: THREE PLUS SACKS NOW IN EACH OF THEIR FIRST FOUR GAMES, THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1985, THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE ERA. AL: TAKEN AT THE KIRK: LET'S LOOK AT OUR STATS, POWERED BY AWS, AARON RODGERS, WE'VE SEEN HIM SITTING IN THE POCKET, MANIPULATING, LOOKING WITH HIS EYES, BUT IT HAS BEEN SO GREAT TO SEE HIM BACK ON THE FIELD TONIGHT. MOVING AROUND, FIVE FOR FIVE, JUST ON FIRE AND FEELING GOOD IN THIS OFFENSE, THAT I THINK WE ARE STARTING TO SEE MORE WEAPONS STARTING TO COME UP TONIGHT AND WITH WHAT THIS OFFENSE IS CAPABLE OF DOING. AL: AARON RODGERS, FOUR TIMES THE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER. MOST RECENTLY IN 2021. STARTING FROM THE 12 YARD LINE. ALLEN. BUNCHED UP AT THE LINE OF KIRK: HOW GREAT IS THAT, HIS FIRST HOME GAME BACK, UP 21-3 AND THE AARON RODGERS CHANCE THAT BEGAN HERE AT METLIFE. PRETTY COOL AFTER HOW HARD HE WORKED TO GET BACK, PUT HIMSELF IN A POSITION TO PLAY FOR THE JETS, 40 YEARS OLD . AL: HE'S HAD A LOT OF GAMES WITH THE JETS HERE. THE LOUDEST CROWD I EVER HEARD AT THE BEGINNING, THEY WERE AMPED UP, AS THEY WERE LAST YEAR ON OPENING NIGHT, THAT LASTED ABOUT FOUR MINUTES. SECOND AND NONE. FLICKS IT. CAUGHT. ALLEN BREAKS THE TACKLE. AND THE ROOKIE TAKES IT OUT TO THE 20 YARD LINE. KIRK: YOU BETTER COME IN AND GET LOW WHEN IT COMES TO SUPPORT WITH BRAELON ALLEN. GET 235 POUNDS, WE SAW HIM DO THIS A LOT IN COLLEGE. THIS TIME IT LOWERS THAT SHOULDER. PRETTY GOOD EFFORT TO KEEP HIM SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN MARKER. AL: TWO-POINT QUOTE -- 2:30 LEFT IN THE THIRD. JETS TRY TO GO TO TWO AND 1. AFTER AN UPSET WIN AND CINCINNATI, THERE WAS A SEATTLE. RODGERS ON THIRD AND 2. LOOKING DOWNFIELD. FIRES, CAUGHT, OPEN, 41 YARD TACKLED. KIRK: A ROUGHING PLAY. AL: YOU HAVE GOT TWO FLAGS. ONE RIGHT AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, THE OTHER ALL THE W BACK. SOMETHING IN THE BACKFIELD. SO YOU MIGHT HAVE TWO SEPARATE GOALS HERE. SO THERE IS YOUR ROUGHING. AND THEN A PENALTY AT THE LINE KIRK: SIMPSON M THE LEFT GUARD. >> THERE IS NO FOUL. HEY MEMBER OF THE OFFENSE DEALT LEGALLY, THERE IS A FOUL, UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS, THE 15 YARD PENALTY WILL BE ADDED AT THE END, AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. KIRK: YOU KNOW WHO IS REALLY PUTTING TOGETHER A NIGHT? CONKLIN. WHEN HE SCRAMBLES, THERE'S A BIG HIT, OFFICIAL RIGHT THERE MAKES THE CALL, BUT WHAT MAKES IT TOUGH WHEN HE GETS OUT HIS HE THROWS LASERS. HE DOES NOT EASE THE BALL IN, HE MAKES UP HIS MIND AND YOU JUST DON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO REACT AS A DEFENSE WHEN HE GETS OUTSIDE OF THE POCKET, AND ONCE HE MAKES UP HIS MIND TO FIND OPEN RECEIVER, THESE GUYS ARE DOING A GOOD JOB OF SCRAMBLING. THAT TIME, CONKLIN DOES A GOOD JOB, EIGHT RECEPTION ON THE NIGHT. AL: AS THEY DO IN EVERY SPORT, CHANTING HIS NAME, AARONRODGERS. COUPLE OF PRETTY GOOD ERRANDS PLAY RIGHT NOW IN NEW YORK --AARON'S PLAY RIGHT NOW IN NEW YORK. THAT IS CAUGHT. HE HAS BEEN THEIR LEADING RECEIVER TONIGHT. TARGETED SIX TIMES, CAUGHT 94 YARDS. KIRK: THAT TIME, THE DEFENSE SAT BACK IN COVERAGE, TRYING TO TAKE DOWN THE SHOTS, AND WAS LOOKING DOWNFIELD TO THE POTENTIAL OF GETTING IT TO MIKE WILLIAMS AND ACROSS TO ERIC WILSON. EVERY THING IS TAKEN AWAY, SO HE CHECKS IT DOWN AND MAKES A DECISION. AL: CONKLIN GOING SIX PASSES ALL OF LAST SEASON. TO THE 30 YARD LINE -- SORRY, HE HOOKED 61. HE DID NOT SCORE A TOUCHDOWN. ONLY SHORT SHIFTED HIM BY 55. KIRK: IT FELT LIKE THAT BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONE POSITION THAT I THINK PEOPLE WERE EXCITED TO SEE THE POTENTIAL OF THE GROWTH WITH AARON RODGERS BACK THERE. AGAIN, YOU KNOW ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER WEAPONS, BUT IF YOU GET CONKLIN GOING AND JEREMY. AL: TWO BACKS. KIRK: AND MIKE WILLIAMS, LAZARD. AL: THOSE TWO BACKS ARE HERE RIGHT NOW, ALLEN AND HOWELL. FIRES BEHIND THE INTENDED TARGET. ERIC WILSON. AND ONE MORE PIECE OF LAUNDRY. KIRK: A GOOD SHOT THEREBY SIMPSON. IT'S LIKE TRYING TO BE AGGRESSIVE. THEY HAVE GOT HIM -- >> AFTER THE PLAY WAS OVER, UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS, OFFENSE, NUMBER 76, THE 15 YARD PENALTY WILL BE ON THE PREVIOUS FIVE. KIRK: THE BALL WAS AWAY, THE PRESSURE UP TO THE TOP ON TYRON SMITH. HE'S DOING HIS JOB, AND YOU SEE SIMPSON, HE GOES ON TOP OF HIM. ONCE HE JUMPED ON TOP OF HIM IS WHERE THE PENALTY CAME IN. HE IS AGGRESSIVE. IT IS NOT GREAT THAT HE IS DOING THIS, BUT I DON'T MIND THE ENERGY. AL: THE OFFENSIVE LINE DOING THE JOB. OF COURSE, NUMBER ONE SURE, PROTECT NUMBER EIGHT AT ALL COSTS. SECOND AND 25. LOOK OUT. THEY DID NOT PROTECT HIM THAT NOW HE GOES TO THE 45 YARD LINE. BOUCHER COMING IN FOR THE SACKED, AND AN INJURED JET RIGHT NOW, STOPPING THE CLOCK AT FIVE SECONDS. YOU HAVE MORGAN ROSES -- MORGAN MOSES, CAME OVER IN A TRADE WITH THE RAVENS, THE RIGHT TACKLE, VETERAN AND IN HIS 11TH SEASON. RIGHT NOW, HE'S IN AGONY. KIRK: IT IS EVERY LINEMAN'S WORST FEAR, YOU GET PUSHED INTO THE BACK FIELD AND YOU GET ROLLED UP ON. COMING FROM BEHIND HIM AS HE IS JUST TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING HE CAN. HIS REACTION TELLS US MORE THAN ANYTHING. AL: HE'S CAUGHT, AND THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO. GREAT TO SEE MOSES GET UP. HE WAS WRITHING IN PAIN AND AGONY, HE HOBBLED OFF. HE'S BEEN A REAL IRONMAN HIS CAREER. HE'S ONLY MISSED THREE GAMES IN 11 SEASONS, 2023, PENN STATE, HE WILL COME IN WHEN WE START THE FOURTH QUARTER. WE SHOULD BE WINDING THE CLOCK HERE IN THE SECOND, TAKING AWAY THE WANING SECONDS OF THE THIRD KIRK: SO HE COMES IN TO PLAY RIGHT TACKLE. HE PLA COLLEGE. AL: ALL OVER THE PLACE, THESE GUYS. JETS ON TOP 21-3, BUT THEY ARE FACING THIRD AND 33 FROM THEIR OWN 46 YARD LINE. RODGERS SELLS FOR A LITTLE SWING PASS, JUST ACROSS THE 50, XAVIER GIPSON MAKING THE CATCH. FOR ARID -- HER RODGERS, 200 -- FOR RODGERS, 257 YARDS, RUN FOR 16 YARDS, LOOKS GREAT OUT OF THE KIRK: IT IS ONE THING TO WONDER HOW HE IS GOING TO PERFORM WITH HIS MIND. WE ALL KNOW THAT. BUT THE THING THAT HAS BEEN GREAT NEWS WE HAVE SEEN BALL COME OUT OF HIS HAND THE WAY IT USED TO. THE VELOCITY IN THAT SPAN HAS BEEN AMAZING, AND THE ACCURACY. AL: FIELDED AT THE 12 YARD LINE HERE. MARCUS JONES. PLAYING -- FLAG ON THIS PLAY, BACK AT THE 45 YARD LINE. PERSONAL FOUL. UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS, PICKING TO NUMBER 19, THE 15 YARD PENALTY WILL BE ENFORCED FROM THE END OF THE AL: CHARLES HAS BEEN A SPECIAL TEAMS HAVEN TO THESE GUYS. MOSES, AT LEAST ABLE TO WALK UNDER HIS OWN POWER, BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM. KIRK: RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE LEAD REFEREE. LIKE THE GUY IN THE WHITE HAT, YOU DO NOT WANT TO MESS AROUND. AL: TOTALLY. SURREPTITIOUS. I MEAN, PENALTIES, OVE YARDS. KIRK: ABOUT THE ONLY THING YOU CAN SAY THAT HAS NOT BEEN CLEAN FOR HIM TONIGHT. AL: FROM THE 31-YARD LINE, PASS 28 RUSHING YARDS, 8:53 PASSING TOUGH NIGHT FOR PERCENT -- TOUGH NIGHT FOR MORE STEAD -- MORSTA EAD. AND MORE ACTION HERE. MESH. KIRK: THAT IS HOW THE BALL CAME AL: MAYBE. >> FIRST DOWN. AL: RECOVERED BY THE DEFENSE, SO CHUCK CLARK, WHO HAD A BIG SACK FLOOR -- BEFORE, -- KIRK: HE NOT ONLY RECOVERS IT BUT RIPS THE BALL OUT BEFORE THE BACK IS DOWN. THEY MIGHT TAKE A PEEK AT THIS, BUT STEPHENSON TRYING TO HOLD ONTO THE FOOTBALL BUT IT LOOKED LIKE AS HE WAS GOING DOWN, CHUCK CLARK RIPS THE FOOTBALL OUT OF HIS HANDS. THAT BALL IS OUT BEFORE HE TOUGH. WHAT A PLAY. AL: THAT IS CONFIRMED. IT IS NOT ABOUT GROWING UP BUT ABOUT HIM STEPPING UP WITH WHITEHEAD MOVING TO TAMPA, GETTING MORE AND MORE REPS WITH HIS SECONDARY. WE SAW BLITZ IN A GOOD PLAY EARLIER TONIGHT ON A SACK, AND STILL PLAYING AGGRESSIVE, TYPICAL JETS DEFENSE FOOTBALL. AL: THEY'VE BEEN AROUND EIGHT YEARS, PICKED THEM UP FROM BALTIMORE. AND HE IS THERE NUMBER THREE BACK, HE'S A ROOKIE, PICKED IN THE FIFTH ROUND OUT OF SOUTH DAKOTA STATE. ONE OF THE FEW GUYS IN SOUTH DAKOTA FOOTBALL I DON'T THINK YOU COVERED LAST YEAR. KIRK: NO, THE JACKRABBITS. HOW ABOUT THAT? AL: UNBELIEVABLE. YOU ARE JOHNNY CASH, YOU HAVE BEEN EVERYWHERE. KIRK: THEY LOVE FOOTBALL OUT THERE. AL: SECOND AND 6. TRIPPED UP. DAVIS AGAIN. JENNINGS MAKES THE TACKLE. KIRK: SO HE IS GOING TO BE OK. HE PUT THAT RIGHT ARM THERE TO BRING THE BALLCARRIER DOWN. RIGHT AWAY YOU CAN SEE THAT HE WAS FEELING THAT, HE WAS GOING TO COME OFF THE FIELD HERE. HE HAS AGAIN BEEN A GREAT STORY EARLY IN HIS CAREER, TRYING TO FIND HIS WAY. LAST YEAR, TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY. MAYBE IT WAS WHEN HE CAME DOWN ON THAT SHOULDER, BUT HE HAS CHECKED OUT. AL: 50 YEAR IN THE LEAGUE. 37. RODGERS FLICKS IT. ADJUSTING, MAKING THE GRAB, MIKE WILLIAMS. TURNED AROUND, HAULS IT IN, BEAT JONATHAN JONES ON THE PL KIRK: AARON RODGERS BRINGS UP BREECE HALL WITH PROTECTION AND THIS IS WHY THEY BROUGHT WILLIAMS OVER TO NEW YORK, FOR THESE OPPORTUNITIES. COMING OFF THAT A.C.L., WONDERED HOW MUCH SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP, BUT THERE HE IS WITH PROTECTION. MIKE WILLIAMS MAKES THAT PLAY. HE HAS GOT TO COME BACK TO THE FOOTBALL OVER THE DEFENDER WITH THOSE LONG CATCH. AL: RODGERS HAS NOW THROWN FOR 273. MOVING, LOOKING, RUNNING, SLIDES TO A STOP AT THE 11 YARD LINE. KIRK: I THINK I GOTTEN OVER EVERY TIME HE HOLDS HIS BREATH, HE'S DONE IT SO MUCH TONIGHT, AND THEN YOU ARE STARTING TO GET COMFORTABLE AND SEEN HIM MAKE PLAYS, FIVE TO FIVE TONIGHT ON THE NIGHT, NATHANIEL HACKETT, AARON RODGERS FAMILIAR WITH EACH OTHER, BUT HE GETS OUT THERE, AND I THINK HE LOOKS BETTER THIS YEAR THAN HE DID HIS LAST YEAR IN GREEN BAY AS FAR AS AND MAKING PLAYS. AL: YOU MAY BE GETTING COMFORTABLE. I DON'T THINK ALL 75,000 ARE. SECOND DOWN AND EIGHTH. ALLEN, BACK TO THEM NINE YARD KAYLEE: THE JETS RIGHT TACKLE MORGAN MOSES HAS BEEN CONFIRMED TO BE A LEFT KNEE INJURY, THEY'VE TAKEN HIM TO THE X-R ROOM. ABOUT HOW YOU SAW HIM WALK OFF ON HIS OWN POWER, HE WENT INTO THE BLUE MEDICAL TENT, AND HE WALKED OFF THE FIELD ON EITHER SIDE UNTIL HE GOT TO THE TUN AND THAT HE WAS TAKEN BY A GOLF CART. AL: THERE IS WHITE. AND HE'S ALSO GOT THE EXTRA FEW DAYS BECAUSE YOU PLAY THURSDAY NIGHT, SO YOU HAVE THE EXTRA THREE DAYS, SO HE HAS DAYS TO GET READY FOR SAN FRANCISCO, THEIR NEXT STOP. KIRK: WE TALKED ABOUT THIS THIS WEEK, NATHANIEL HACKETT UNDER FIRE HERE IN NEW YORK, AND IS PART OF THE GIG. YOU KNOW WHEN THINGS ARE NOT GREAT, SOMEONE HAS TO BE THE FALL GUY. LAST YEAR HE WAS THAT GUY, BUT I REALLY LIKE TO WATCH THREE WEEKS AND, ESPECIALLY TONIGHT, STARTING TO SEE THIS PLAN AND THE VERSATILITY OF HOW THEY ARE ATTACKING. I HOPE FANS UNDERSTAND, AARON RODGERS HAD A SPECIAL NIGHT. THIS IS NOT JUST AARON RODGERS. THIS IS AN OFFENSIVE LINE SHOWING SOMETHING. RECEIVERS BESIDES GARRETT WILSON, TWO BACKS, A GREAT GROUP HACKETT PUTTING THAT PLAN AL: THEY HAVE DENVER NEXT, FRANCISCO. RODGERS AND THE END ZONE. CANNOT HOLD IT IN. MIKE WILLIAMS HAS MADE SO MANY OF THOSE CATCHES IN HIS CAREER WITH THE CHARGERS. NOT THIS TIME. 43. KIRK: JUST NOT QUITE. HE MAY HAVE MISSED TIME THA ONE. HE' HE'S SO GOOD AT GOING UP INTO THE AIR AND HIGH POINTING THE BALL WITH THESE CONTESTED CATCHES. HE WAS ACTUALLY STARTING TO COME DOWN, AND HECK OF AN EFFORT WITH JONATHAN JONES KNOCK GIVING UP, GETTING HIS HANDS ON THEIR AND DRIPPING IT AWAY FRO WILLIAMS ON THAT FADE. AL: JONES BEEN AWAY SIX INCHES. 64 AND A FIVE, 10TH DOWN. -- FOURTH DOWN. 28 YARD FIELD GOAL, TRYING TO MAKE IT 2 FIRST, HE WAS WITH THE PATRIOTS, AS YOU LOOK AT JEROD MAYO, THE CURRENT HEAD COACH. BILL WAS AN ASSISTANT IN NEW ENGLAND, THAT'S WHEN BOB KRAFT GOT TO KNOW HIM. CAME HERE TO NEW YORK AND THEN GOT THE JOB IN NEW ENGLAND. MAYO AT 38 IN HIS FIRST YEAR, AND BELICHICK, YOU LOOK AT BILL BELICHICK NOW, OF ALL THINGS TV, HE IS EVERYWHERE. HE IS THE KING OF ALL MEDIA, FROM HOWARD STERN. KIRK: AND HE'S KILLING IT. HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB. HE AND NICK SABIN BOTH DOING A GREAT JOB GOING INTO THAT ROL WE WOULD NOT EXPECT EITHER ONE OF THEM TO DO THAT. BOTH SEEM TO BE ENJOYING IT. AL: MAYO WAS DESIGNATED EARLY ON BY BOB KRAFT AS THE LIKELY SUCCESSOR, AND IT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO LIKE 2015 OR WHEN MAYO WAS PART OF THE TRIP TO ISRAEL. TAKING A LOT OF HIS CURRENT AND FORMER PLAYERS TO ISRAEL AS THE CATCH IS MADE HERE. NINE YARD GAIN FOR DOUGLAS. HE WATCHED THE WAY MAYO WAS RESPONDING TO THE OLDER GUYS, AND HOW HIS PRESENCE AND MANNER, AND BOB KRAFT THOUGHT WHEN THE TIME COMES, HE'S G GUY, AND HE WAS. KIRK: THERE IS A GREAT MESSAGE YOU THINK JEROD MAYO HAD A IDEA THAT ROBERT KRAFT WAS SITTING, WATCHING HIM AND MAKING A DECISION THAT WOULD YEARS LATER IMPACT HIS LIFE? THINK ABOUT THAT. YOU NEVER KNOW. JUST DOING THE RIGHT THING AND SHOWING WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT. AL: EXACTLY. SWINGING TO THE OUTSIDE AND TAKEN DOWN THERE IS GIBSON. SECOND DOWN. KIRK: JEROD MAYO THESE FIRST COUPLE OF GAMES HAS BEEN ABLE TO BE COMPETITIVE. I WENT TO THE G IT WAS A GAME THAT T CONTROLLED. GOOD JOB OF WINNING THE TIME OF POSSESSION, THEY WERE WINNING, THEY WERE ABLE TO CLOCK, AND THEY GOT OUT OF THERE WITH A WIN. AND THE SAME KIND OF GAME FOR SEATTLE WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO CONTROL THINGS. THEY DID NOT WIN, BUT THEY BATTLED. HERE TONIGHT, RIGHT AWAY, THE GAME GETS AWAY FROM AARON RODGERS, HAVING A NIGHT, AND IF ANYBODY YOU ABOUT THE MATCHUP, THEY KNOW JEROD MAYO'S TEAM NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO KEEP AARON RODGERS ON THE SIDELINE, SQUEEZE THE CLOCK, AND ONCE THAT DID NOT HAPPEN WITH THIS OFFENSIVE LINE AND WERE WITH WHERE THEY ARE AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME OFFENSIVELY, IT IS CHALLENGING FOR THEM TO GET PREDICTABLE PLAYCALLING. IT IS JUST OUT THERE GAME, AND IT WILL BE THAT WAY THIS YEAR. THAT IS WHY THEY WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO SIDE OF THE FOOTBALL. AL: I THINK THEY WILL HAVE FIND A TOP GUY IS A WIDE MEANWHILE, THAT LINE BREAKING DOWN AGAIN, AND HERE COME THE GANGRENE GUYS, JAVON KINLAW CAME OVER FROM SAN A SACK. KIRK: QUINCY WILSON, QUINCY WILLIAMS, RATHER, BRINGING EVEN THOUGH HE DOESN'T GET THERE, HE OCCUPIES THE BACK, FREEZE UP OTHERS TO GET THERE, AND WE ARE NOT USED TO SEEING JEFF ALDRICH DIAL IT UP, BUT HE'S WISE IN CHANGING AGAINST THIS INEXPERIENCED IT HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE. AL: FIFTH PUNT. BEHRINGER. FIELDED AT THE 10, TAKEN DOWN RIGHT AWAY IS GIBSON. KIRK: HOW GOOD IS HE? BEHRINGER GETS THE GA NEW ENGLAND. HE'S A WEAPON. AL: HE DOES. THE TACKLE IS MADE, ANDTHAT IS T THE NOTES FROM AROUND THE LEAGUE , WHEN IT COMES TO FIELD GOALS, IT IS CRAZY. 35 OF 39 FROM 50 PLUS. AND RODGERS IS GOING TO THROW TO THE OUTSIDE. CAUGHT HERE. SPUN DOWN AS GARRETT WILSON. I HAVE AN IDEA THERE. IT'S CRAZY NOW, IT'S LIKE TOO MUCH, 32-35-39, 50 PLUS, I WOULD LIKE TO DEFLATE THE CAVE ALL. KIRK: I HEARD YOU SAY THAT EARLIER. NARROWING THE UPRISE. AL: COULD DO THAT. KIRK: YOU ARE BIG ON THAT. AL: I WOULD LIKE TO GET THE TOUCH BACK AFTER THE 35 YARD KIRK: KIRK: TWO THINGS. AL: IF COMMISSIONER FOR A DAY. THANK GOD I'M NOT. SECOND AND 2. RODGERS TAKES THE PLAY CLOCK ALL THE WAY DOWN. AND ALMOST DOWN AND ONE. KIRK: JETS, THREE OFFENSIVE TOUCHDOWNS IN EACH OF THE FIRST THREE GAMES THIS YEAR. LAST TIME THEY DID THAT, 1989. SO I DO NOT WANT TO JINX THE JETS BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN A TOUGH RUN, BUT ANYBODY WATCHING THE GAME, WE SAW BUFFALO LAST AGAINST MIAMI, AND I THINK WE LEFT THAT NIGHT THINKING THAT BUFFALO HAS A CHANCE IF THEY CAN -- IF THE JETS STAY HEALTHY, IT'S GOING TO BE A FUN YEAR. HEALTH. AL: VERY INTERESTING. TAKING MORE TIME OFF THE CLOCK. OTHER NEWS AND SPORTS. SHOW A OTANI TONIGHT. THE DODGERS IN MIAMI. 6-6, THREE HOMERS, 10 RUNS BATTED IN. HE NOW HAS 51 HOMERS AND 51 STEALS. KIRK: FIRST PLAYER IN MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL HISTORY, IS THAT RIGHT? AL: THAT 50-50 CLUB. NEXT YEAR, HE'S GOING TO PITCH ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS. KIRK: I DON' KIRK: I DON'T THINK HE GETS THE LOVE THAT HE DESERVES. IT WAS BETTER WHEN HE WAS WITH THE ANGELS. AL: WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI, WEST OF COLORADO ANYWAY. 20 YARD LINE. 20 YARD GAIN HERE. CHEWING UP THE REST OF THE CLOCK. KIRK: TONIGHT IS A BIG NIGHT. WE ARE ONLY AT WEEK THREE. SUCH A LONG WAY TO GO. IT'S MORE THAN AARON RODGERS. AARON RODGERS IS LOOKING GREAT. TALKED A LOT ABOUT HIM. THE MOVEMENT, THE COMMAND OF THE OFFENSE, ALL THAT HE NORMALLY DOES. THEN THE MOVEMENT OUT OF THE WHAT'S AROUND HIM. DRAKE MAY MIGHT POTENTIALLY COME IN. THE LINE, THE PACKS, THE THE TIGHT END, CONKLIN. AL: UP THE MIDDLE. ALAN. EARLY-SEASON TRENDS. FIELD GOALS MADE. KIRK: 70 31 WEEK. AL: CRAZY. 16 GAMES. KIRK: WE TALKED ABOUT IT LAST WEEK. DEFENSE'S TREND IS PLAYING COVERAGE. IT'S NOT JUST COVERAGE. IT'S MORE OF PUTTING ATOP ON THE DEFENSE, REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE COVERAGES. OFFENSES ARE TAKING LONGER AND LONGER TO BUILD THE CHEMISTRY, TIMING, RHYTHM. I'VE HEARD A LOT OF COACHES TALKING ABOUT, THEY DON'T PRACTICE IN THE OFF-SEASON IS MUCH AS THEY USED TO. IT TAKES LONGER TIMING. AL: TRYING TO HIT WILSON. THAT WOULD HAVE PUT HIM OVER 300 YARDS BUT NO. IT DOES INDEED LOOK LIKE HE'S GOING TO MAKE HIS NFL DEBUT. KIRK: THE ONLY BALL THAT AARON RODGERS WOULD LOVE TO HAVE BACK. HE HAD AN OPENING THEIR AND JUST DIDN'T QUITE GET IT TO GARRETT THAT ONE PASS, HE'S FRUSTRATED WITH HIMSELF. HOPE THAT DOESN'T RUIN HIS NIGHT. HE'S HAD A GOOD NIGHT. AL: I DOUBT IT. THIRD PUNT OF THE NIGHT. ATTACKING THE 42 YARD LINE. AL: DRAKE MAY COME OF THE N THREE OVERALL PICK IN THE DRAFT. CALEB WILLIAMS WENT NUMBER ONE TO THE CHICAGO BEARS. THERE ARE HIS NUMBERS. IN CHAPEL HILL. THIS IS NOT QUITE THROWING HIM TO THE WOLVES HERE. IT FIGURES TO BE FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE, YOU WOULD THINK. LET'S SEE. STARTS OUT WITH THE PASS ON THE FIRST PLAY. NEARLY A PICK. THAT WOULD'VE BEEN SOMETHING. KIRK: HOW MUCH WOULD HE HAVE LOVED THAT? TO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO INTERCEPT THAT. HIS FIRST REP AS AN NFL PLAYER AND HE TELEGRAPHS IT. YOU CAN SEE THE VETERAN CARTER BAITING HIM AND STEPPING IN FRONT OF IT ALMOST COMES UP WITH THE INTERCEPTION. AL: UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE. 12-18 FOR 98 YARDS. NOW ON THE GROUND IS ANTONIO FOUR MINUTES TO PLAY IN THE FOURTH. THIRD AND 3. HE IS GOING TO TAKE OFF BUT NOT GO VERY FAR. HE IS TACKLED BY SHERWOOD AT THE 50 YARD LINE. KIRK: MAYE IS NOT A GUY THAT CAN GET AWAY FROM PRESSURE. SHERWOOD IS A FORMER SAFETY AND HAS EMERGED IN THESE LAST FOUR YEARS AS A LINEBACKER WHO IS CONTROLLING THE MIDDL WELCOMES HIM TO THE NFL. AL: THAT'S THE WELCOME. SAME THING. MEANWHILE, BREAKING TABLES AND ABLE TO PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN IS GIBSON. KIRK: JETS ROTATING SOMEBODY'S IN BUT THEY ARE NOT CHANGING THEIR PHILOSOPHY. THEY WILL BE AGGRESSIVE TO THE FINAL WHISTLE. IT'S JUST THE DNA OF THIS DEFENSE. AL: SCREEN HERE. NO BLOCKING OUT IN FRONT. HE MAKES THE TACKLE ON QUINCY. KIRK: IT MAKES YOU WONDER. AT -- ARE BOTH SIDES ABLE TO WORK THIS THING OUT? CAN YOU IMAGINE ADDING TO THIS DEFENSE WITH YOUR MAIN JOHNSON DOWN, EVENTUALLY COMES MAN. YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT WORKED OUT. AL: THE JETS SAY NO, WE ARE NOT GETTING RID OF HIM. WE ARE NOT LETTING HIM GO. KIRK: NOW THAT CHUCK CLARK IS COMING ALONG, D.J. REED, TONY ADAMS, SAUCE GARDNER, MICHAEL CARTER. THAT'S A HECK OF BACKEND. GREAT LINEBACKERS WITH WILLIAMS AND SHERWOOD AND MOSLEY. AND THEN THE FRONT IS AS GOOD AS YOU FIND. THAT'S TERRIFYING. AL: THIRD AND 2. CATCHES MADE. THE THROATED JOHNSON. JUDGE COMES IN THEIR. YOU SEE WHERE THEY SPOTTED. KIRK: -- >> THIS IS. AL: IN THE MEANTIME, THAT'S THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING. TWO MINUTES UNTIL THE JETS ARE OFFICIALLY 2-1. KIRK: NINE FOR AARON RODGERS. REALLY COMMENDED THE OFFENSE. THAT'S THE THING TONIGHT. HE GOT OUTSIDE OF THE POCKET. 5-5 ON THE RUN. WHAT A LASER FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. THIS OFFENSE WILL CONTINUE TO NATHANIEL HACKETT PUTTING THE PLAN TOGETHER, OFTEN CRITICIZED OFFENSIVE COURT NADER. HE'S A GREAT COORDINATOR. WHEN WE GO OUT AND EXECUTE. NOTHING MAKES ME HAPPIER THAN TO TRY TO GET OUT THERE AND SHOW PEOPLE WHAT KIND OF COACHING CAN BE. BIG NIGHT FOR HIM AS WELL. AL: HE REALLY WANTS TO PLAY TAKES THE HEAT AWAY FROM HACKETT. HEAT ON MAYE AND TO GET SACKED AT THE 44 YARD LINE. KIRK: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR NEXGEN STAFFS. THE PATRIOTS, 14 MISSED TACKLES. 100 -- 100 YARDS THAT THEY LOST YOU COULD EITHER LOOK AT IT ONE WAY -- T BETTER JOB AT RUNNING THE FOOTBALL AND TACKLING. THE JETS DID A HECKUVA JOB AFTER THE CATCH, ESPECIALLY EARLY IN THIS GAME. WITH ACCURATE PASSES. GIVES YOU THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. THEY DID A HECKUVA
