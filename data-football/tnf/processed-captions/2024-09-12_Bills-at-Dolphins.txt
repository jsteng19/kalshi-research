THE DYNAMIC KICKOFF, LAST YEAR, 22% OF THE KICKS WERE RETURNED. I THINK THE LEAK WANTED A LITTLE MORE, THE KICKER IS AT THE 35 IN THE KIC TEAM AT THE OTHER 40. NOBODY CAN TOUCH IT UNLESS IT LANDS IN THE LANDING ZONE. PRETTY MUCH WHAT WE SAW LAST SEASON. TAGOVAILOA, ONE OF THE HIGHEST PAID GUYS IN THE LEAGUE IN HIS FIRST YEAR. JOE BURROW WAS THE NUMBER ONE PICK AND IT CAME DOWN TO TAGOVAILOA OR HERBERT AND THEY WENT BACK TO BACK, MIAMI TOOK TUA INTO THE CHARGERS TOOK HERBERT. LAST YEAR LED THE LEAGUE IN PASSING YARDAGE. CHECKING OUT THE FIRST PLAY HERE. START FROM THE 30 OUT -- 30 YARD LINE. SHORT DROP, QUICK THROW. THREE STRAIGHT FELLS. MAKING THE TACKLE. KIRK: YESTERDAY MIKE MCDANIEL TELLING USTUA HAD A GAME CHANGING OFF-SEASON, CARING HIMSELF IN A DIFFERENT WAY SINCE JANUARY WAS A STRONG STATEMENT. YOU MENTIONED THE NUMBERS HE PUT UP BUT I THINK AS FAR AS MENTAL TOUGHNESS AND BUYING IN AND BECOMING THE GUY FOR THE FRANCHISE, HE' FRANCHISE, HE'S TAKING HUGE STRIDES COMING INTO THIS YEAR. AL: SECOND DOWN THROUGH THE MIDDLE, YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT TUA AND TYREEK HILL SAID LAST WEEK AT HALFTIME, THEY WERE DOWN BY A LOT OF POINTS. HE SAID IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD HIS HAWAIIAN ACCENT. HE SAID I WASN'T EVEN THAT WAY IN HIGH SCHOOL. KIRK: IT SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT WHAT MIKE MCDANIEL IS TALKING ABOUT, HE'S BECOME THE ALPHA AND THE LEADER OF THE OFFENSE. AL: THIRD DOWN AND ONE. FIRST DOWN. KIRK: AFTER ALL THE HYPE AND THE TALK AND THE PERCEPTION OF TUA INTO TYREEK HILL AND THE PRE-SNAP MOTION AND IF YOU TALK TO THE COACHES AND PLAYERS THEY WILL TELL YOU IT STARTS AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. THEY PRIDE THEMSELVES ON THE PHYSICALITY AND RUNNING THE BALL TO SET UP EVERY OTHER ASPECT WHERE YOU CAN GET TYREEK HILL AND OTHERS INVOLVED. AL: MOTION HERE WITH JULIAN HILL. TOSSED BACK, GREAT TACKLE IN THE BACKFIELD. THE SECOND TACKLE OF THE NIGHT FOR A LOSS THERE. KIRK: HE HAS THE BODY OF A SAFETY, HE CAME OVER LAST YEAR FROM BRADEN BAY IN LATE OCTO AND YOU CAN SEE HE IS A GUY ABLE TO GET AWAY FROM BLOCKS. GOES INSIDE, FREES UP DOUGLAS TO MAKE THAT PLAY. LOSS OF YARDAGE, VERY IMPORTANT TO MIAMI WITH THIS OFFENSIVE LINE AGAINST THE BILLS, TO STAY THE STICKS. AL: SECOND AND 13 M OF THE SAME FORMATION, SPIN AROUND, DEEP DOWNFIELD. TYREEK HILL HAD AN 80 YARD TOUCHDOWN RECEPTION LAST WEEK. CHRISTIAN BENFORD SET UP A THIRD DOWN. KIRK: THE BILLS'S CORNERS ARE THE FASTEST, THEY ARE BIGGER. HE'S ANTICIPATING THE SHOT SO HE IS SEVEN YARDS OUT IN FRONT. FIRST COUPLE PLAYS THEY HAD TWO SAFETIES BACK, THAT TIME ONLY ONE SAFETY, BUT ALSO GREAT JOB JUST IN CASE THEY TOOK THE SHOT. AL: MISSING JOHNSON, THE SAFETY, INACTIVE TONIGHT. THE DEFLECTION. THE BILLS HAVE IT FOR THE 36 YARD LINE. DEMARCUS INGRAM. INTENDED THAT TIME FOR GRANT DUBOSE. EARLY TURNOVER SETS UP THE BILLS. KIRK: DUBOSE CAME OVER RECENTLY IN THE TIMING IS OFF, HE'S NOT READY FOR THIS FOOTBALL. TUA DOES A GREAT JOB LOOKING BACK, INTO THE WINDOW AND ON THE MONEY AND I DON'T KNOW IF HE GOT A HAND ON THAT FOOTBALL ERROR -- FOOTBALL OR DEBOSE WAS NOT READY FOR IT. RIGHT OFF THE SHOULDER PAD. THE BILLS GET THE FIRST TURNOVER OF THE GAME TO GIVE JOSH PLUS TERRITORY. AL: FIRST CAREER INTERCEPTION. QUICK THROW OUTSIDE. FINDING HIS WAY IS DALTON KINCAID, THE TIGHT END. JOSH ALLEN, TWO PASSING TOUCHDOWNS, TWO BRUSHING TOUCHDOWNS -- TWO RUSHING TOUCHDOWNS LAST WEEK. HE INJURED HIS HAND, YOU CAN SEE HE IS WEARING A GLOVE. HE STAYED IN THE GAME LAST WEEK AND HE SAYS HE'S FINE. SECOND AND 1. INSIDE THE 24 YARD LINE, STOPP BY KENDALL FULLER, NOW IN HIS NINTH SEASON. KIRK: THE GLOVE AND YOU CAN S THE TWO MIDDLE FINGERS TAPED TOGETHER. WHAT SURPRISED ME IS THE SIZE OF THE GLOVE, THAT'S NOT A RECEIVER GLOVE, YOU CAN SEE THE PADDING, ALMOST LIKE A LINEBACKER WHERE THAT TYPE OF GLOVE. IT IS PROTECTED AND TAKING CARE OF. AL: GOOD THROW AGAIN, TO THE RIGHT SIDE, KINCAID WASN'T USED A LOT LAST WEEK BUT THIS IS A TEAM WITH KINCAID AND THEY ALSO HAVE AUSTIN KNOX. KIRK: A LOT OF 12 PERSONNEL WITH ONE RUNNING BACK TWO TIGHT END HE CAN GET OUT WIDE AND MAKE PLAYS. IT'S LIKE HE TOOK A KNEE TO THE HEAD AFTER HE WAS DOWN. AL: SECOND DOWN AND 2. THE FAKE, THE ROLE COME OF THE THROW INCOMPLETE. THIRD DOWN AND 2. BECCA JOSH ALLEN. I THINK EVERY WEEK WE WILL HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST PAID QUARTERBACKS IN THE LEAGUE. DAK PRESCOTT AFTER LAST WEEK. KIRK: HE'S BEEN THE FACE OF THIS FRANCHISE FOR A LONG TIME BUT WITH THE MOVES, SEAN MCDERMOTT IS LOOKING FOR HIM, ALMOST A NEW CHAPTER FOR HIM TAKING OVER. AL: THIRD DOWN, THEY BRING IN JOHNSON AS THE THIRD DOWN BACK. LOOK OUT. THAT IS DAVID LONG JUNIOR. STOPS IN THE BACKFIELD, FOURTH KIRK: LOOKS LIKE THEY WILL GO FOR THIS, A PERFECTLY TIMED BLITZ, GOOD CALL. AL: ANTHONY WEAVER IS THE NEW DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR. THE CROWD AT FULL DECIBEL RIGHT NOW AT FOURTH DOWN AND 3. AT LEAST THEY WILL LINE UP TO GO BACK IN THE BACKFIELD. CURTIS SAMUEL AS WELL. ALAN TOOK A LOOK AT THE DEFENSE AND CALLS A TIMEOUT. THAT WILL BRING IN THE FIELD GOAL. KIRK: TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH COMMAND HE HAS TAKING OVER AND HAVING TO REBUILD THE OFFENSE, BASICALLY AN ENTIRE NEW ROOM OF WIDE RECEIVERS, THE TIGHT ENDS WILL BE HEAVILY INVOLVED TONIGHT AND ALL YEAR, BUT HIS CAREER, WE TALKED ALL WEEK ABOUT WHAT HE'S DONE, NOT JUST THE WINS AND LOSSES, 11 AND 2, BUT HIS NUMBERS. THIS IS THE TEAM HE IS PROBABLY PERFORMED THE BEST AGAINST AND JOE BRADY HAS HAD AN ENTIRE OFF-SEASON, HE TOOK OVER FOR KEN DORSEY LAST YEAR AS THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, TO GET THIS OFFENSE READY TO GO THIS YEAR. AL: HE WILL LIMIT MORE JOSH ALLEN IS ALWAYS A THREAT TO RUN. BACK AND FORTH AND GETS SET. WIDE OPEN, INSIDE THE 10. JAMES COOK TAKES IT IN. WE GO FOR IT AT FOURTH DOWN, A LOT OF MOTION, FINDS WIDE-OPEN. KIRK: MIAMI WAS SOME OF THEIR OWN MEDICINE, COOK HERE GETS CAUGHT UP IN THE TRAFFIC WHAT A GREAT CALL BY JOE BRADY. ANTICIPATING IT ON FOURTH DOWN, GETS TO THAT MESH TO GET THE BACK OUT OF THE BACKFIELD, THE TWO RECEIVERS DO A GOOD JOB OF LOOKING LIKE THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING THAT PICK, TOO MUCH TRAFFIC FOR DAVID LONG TO GET THROUGH. AL: THEY GO 37 YARDS AND SIX PLAYS INTO THE END ZONE. AFTER THAT PICK GOES COOK. 7-0 BUFFALO. HOT DAY. A LOT OF RAIN YESTERDAY. THIS KICKOFF WILL RESULT IN ANOTHER TOUCHBACK. 2-2 ON TOUCHBACKS. THEY COME OUT TO THE 30 YARD KIRK: SOMETHING TO KEEP AN EYE ON. THE RED ORBS YOU SEE AS DEFENSIVE ALERTS. IT IS NOT NECESSARILY PREDICTING WHO WILL BLITZ BUT ALERTING WHO LOOKS UNUSUAL AS A THREAT TO MAYBE COME AFTER THE QUARTERBACK WITH THE HELP OF AI, WE GET IN THE MINDS OF THE QUARTERBACKS AND IDENTIFY THE POTENTIAL BLITZERS. A COOL THING. AL: AI IS GOING TO GET INTO OUR BRAINS. [LAUGHTER] PRESSURE, THROWS INTO TRAFFIC. GETTING AWAY THAT TIME IS JONNU SMITH TO THE 45 YARD LINE. DID NOT DO MUCH LAST WEEK. THEY WANT TO USE HIM MORE IF POSSIBLE. IN HIS EIGHTH YEAR. ONE CATCH LAST WEEK AGAINST JACKSONVILLE. KIRK: A GROWING TREND ACROSS THE NFL IS DEFENSES PUTTING TWO SAFETIES BACK. WE SAW THAT AGAINST PATRICK MAHOMES. HE HAD TO ADJUST. WE ARE SEEING THAT AROUND THE NFL. THAT IS WHY NUMBERS ARE DOWN FOR QUARTERBACKS. IT FORCES YOU TO BE PATIENT YOU HAVE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL. AL: YOU HAVE WADDLE ON AN END AROUND AND JAYLEN WADDLE PICKS UP FOUR. YOU TALK ABOUT HILL AND YOU PICK UP WADDLE, THAT IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS AS A 1-2 PUNCH. KIRK: YOU CAN LOOK AT A DIFFERENT STYLE, JA'MARR CHASE AND TEE HIGGINS BUT THESE TWO SET THE PACE. JAYLEN WADDLE IS THE TOP NUMBER 2 RECEIVER IN THIS LEAGUE. THEY ARE NOT MESSING AROUND WITH BUFFALO. RESPECT FOR THE SPEED. MOST OF THIS NIGHT THEY WILL MAKE THEM EARN IT AND HAVE TO DRIVE THE LENGTH OF THE FIELD. AL: A FLIP, HERE GOES TYREEK HILL IS BOUNCED OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 42 YARD LINE. A FIRST DOWN FOR THE DOLPHINS. KIRK: AGAIN, IF YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP THOSE SAFETIES BACK, WILL HAVE TO RALLY TO THE BALL AND GET AS MANY HATS THERE AS YOU CAN. HE GETS HIT AS HE IS ABOUT TO GO OUT OF BOUNDS BY THE CORNER, CHRISTIAN BENFORD. THAT IS THE ANSWER -- RUN THE FOOTBALL, SHORT PASS GAME AND THEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN IN THE RED ZONE. AL: HE HAD AN 80-YARDER LAST WEEK. WE WILL HEAR FROM BILL VINOVICH FOR THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT. REFEREE: FALSE START, OFFENSE, NUMBER 89. FIVE YARD PENALTY, STILL FIRST AL: AS HIGHLY A RESPECTED AS A REFEREE AS THERE IS, BILL VINOVICH. KIRK: WHAT IS THE OVER/UNDER ON HOW MANY GAMES YOU HAVE CALLED OF HIS? AL: A LOT. HE IS GOOD, THOUGH. CONSISTENTLY GOOD. MCDERMITT IN HIS EIGHTH SEASON, MCDANIEL IN HIS THIRD AS YOU LOOK AT THE COACHES. NOW, FIRST AND 15. FLIP BACK. ACHANE HAS ROOM, THERE HE GOES! AUSTIN JACKSON LEADING THE WAY, THE RIGHT TACKLE. ACHANE AVERAGE LAST YEAR OVER 7 YARDS PER CARRY. THIS TIME, GOOD FOR 14. KIRK: THE MOTION AND THE MISDIRECTION JUST THE LINEBACKERS TO TAKE ONE STEP IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND CREATES SPACE. AL: SECOND AND INCHES. A LITTLE MORE THAN HALFWAY THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER. HILL IN MOTION. THROUGH THE MIDDLE. BIG HOLE, ACHANE TO THE 25 YARD LINE. RAHEEM MOSTERT IS HURTS. THEY ARE 1 AND 1A KIRK: BOBBY BABICH TAKING OVER AS THE DEFENSIVE PLAY CALLER. THIS YEAR, HE IS HANDED THOSE DUTIES. YOU CAN SEE THE PLAN TONIGHT. TRY TO KEEP THE SPEED IN FRONT OF THEM BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO TACKLE WELL AGAIN SOME VERY ELUSIVE RUNN RECEIVERS. AL: SPIN-O-RAMA AGAIN. A LOT OF ACTION BUT ACHANE PICKS UP JUST ONE YARD ON THAT. SECOND AND LONG. KIRK: THE SNAP AFFECTS THE TIMING. HECKUVA PLAY BY TUA TO CATCH THE BALL AND STILL GET IT TO ACHANE AND THEN GET IT TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. IT LOOKED LIKE HE MIGHT ABORT AND GIVE UP ON HANDING IT OFF. NICE JOB BY ACHANE, WAITING FOR HIM JUST LONG ENOUGH. AL: A COUPLE OF HIGH SNAPS ALREADY FROM AARON BREWER. THIS TIME, A GOOD SNAP. GOOD THROW. INSIDE THE 20 TO THE 18 YARD LINE GOES JEFF WILSON. HE WOULD BE THE NUMBER 2 BACK IN THE ABSENCE OF MOSTERT, ACHANE NUMBER 1. THERE IS MOSTERT. 21 TOTAL TOUCHDOWNS LAST YEAR, TIED FOR MOST IN THE LEAGUE. KIRK: JEFF WILSON, MOSTERT, ACHANE, THEY ARE ALL IN THAT 4.35 THEM. AL: VON MILLER IN THE GAME FOR HE HAD A SACK LAST WEEK, SNAPPING A 14-GAME DROUGHT. TUA STEPS UP, FINDS THE OPEN MAN , INSIDE THE FIVE, TO THE 1-YARD LINE, JAYLEN WADDLE. JUST OUTSIDE THE GOAL LINE FIRST AND GOAL FROM THE 1. KIRK: WE ARE USED TO SEEING JOSH ALLEN MAKE THIS KIND OF MOVE AND NOW WE SEE IT FROM TUA. STEPS UP AND FREEZEZS CAM LEWIS. HE IS CONCERNED ABOUT TUA OFF. TUA LOOKS DOWNFIELD, DOES NOT HESITATE TO GET THE BALL TO JAYLEN WADDLE. MOVING THE BALL IN FRONT OF THOSE SAFETIES, RIGHT DOWN THE FIELD. AL: FIRST DOWN AND GOAL. ACHANE, CAN HE GET THERE? THE BALL IS OUT! HILL COMES UP WITH IT. THEY MIGHT HAVE RULED HIM DOWN. A FLAG IS THROWN. NUMBER 74. AL: THE PLAY BLOWN DEAD ANYWAY. IT LOOK LIKE LIAM EICHENBERG, THE RIGHT GUARD, WITH THE PENALTY. BACK NOW TO THE 6-YARD LINE. PRETTY CLEAR THERE. PLAY BLOWN DEAD. AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME. NOW ACHANE, SETTING UP NEXT TO TUA. GIVE IT TO ACHANE AGAIN. THREADS HIS WAY FOR A YARD, MAYBE TWO. UNDER FOUR MINUTES TO PLAY IN THE FIRST QUARTER. ED OLIVER MAKES THE TACKLE. KIRK: GO BACK TO THE STRATEGY OF BUFFALO TRYING TO MAKE THEM EARN IT. IT WILL BE THE 10TH PLAY OF THE DRIVE FOR MIKE MCDANIEL AND THE OFFENSE FOR THE DOLPHINS. YOU WILL GIVE UP YARDS IF YOU ARE BUFFALO. WHAT HAPPENS IN THE RED AREA? ARE THEY KICKING FIELD GOALS OR SCORING TOUCHDOWNS? AL: MIAMI LAST YEAR, SECOND-BEST SECOND AND GOAL. TUA UNDER PRESSURE. FLIPS IT TO THE OUTSIDE AND ACHANE IS THERE. THE DEFENDER FALLING DOWN AND ACHANE WALKS INTO THE END ZONE. CAM LEWIS FALLING DOWN. EASY ROAD TO 6. KIRK: TWO DOLPHINS OUT IN THE FLAT. SPECTER GETS LOST IN COVERAGE. HE WILL LOOK AROUND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF HE HAS A CROSSER. HE NEEDS TO GET OUT IN THE FLAT AND DEAL WITH A BACK. AL: ACHANE NOW 13 TOUCHDOWNS IN 13 CAREER GAMS. SANDERS TIES THE GAME WITH THE EXTRA POINT. PERFECT BALANCE ON THAT DRIVE. 10 PLAYS -- FIVE RUNS, FIVE PASSES. 3:21 TO GO IN THE QUARTER, 7-7. DIERDORF. DAN MARINO, ONE OF THE ALL-TIME GREATS. HALL OF FAME CLASS OF 2005. THAT GAME ENDED AT THE 1-YARD DOUG FLUTIE TRY TO HIT ANDRE REED. IT WAS A CRAZY GAME. ANOTHER TOUCHBACK HERE. KIRK: WE ALL WENT BACK AND WERE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE MEMORIES FROM THAT GAME. IT WAS FUN TO WATCH YOU RELIVE AL: THERE WERE. IT WAS A WILD-CARD GAME FOR THE AGES. JIMMY JOHNSON WAS THE HEAD COACH AND YOU HAD THE BUFFALO BILLS CLOSING IN. THIS WAS THE 1990'S. IN THE 1990'S, THEY WERE GOOD -- HERE THEY COME AGAIN WITH THE FOUR STRAIGHT SUPER BALLS, DID NOT -- SUPER BOWLS, DID NOT WIN ANY. KAYLEE: WE SAW THE BILLS ONLY OTHER CAPTAIN BESIDES JOSH ALLEN, THAT WOULD BE TERREL BERNARD, HEAD INTO THE LOCKER ROOM AFTER A QUICK VISIT IN THE BLUE TENT. HE WAS HOLDING ONTO HIS LEFT SHOULDER. KEEP AN EYE ON THAT. AL: THAT WOULD BE A VERY BIG LOSS. SECOND DOWN AND 7. ALLEN THROWS OVER THE MIDDLE. SHAKIR. THIRD AND. KIRK: A HUGE POTENTIAL LOSS WITH BERNARD. YOU HAVE TWO NEW SAFETIES. CAM LEWIS IS IN. IF YOU ARE A BILLS FAN, YOU ALREADY CONCERNED ABOUT THE INJURIES. SEEING THAT IS NOT GOOD. AL: WITHOUT QUESTION. THIRD DOWN AND 1 FOR BUFFALO. TY JOHNSON, THIRD DOWN BACK, NUMBER 26 INTO THE GAME. ALLEN DROPS IT, UNDER PRESSURE, ESCAPES, KEEPS IS EYES DOWNFIELD, FIRES, NOT AWAY. CALAIS CAMPBELL GOT HIS HANDS ON IT AT 6'8". FOURTH AND 1. KIRK: PEOPLE WILL WONDER ABOUT THE GLOVE. I THINK HE JUST DROPS IT. YOU SEE HIM TRY TO BRING THE BALL IN. WHAT A TOUGH TIME FOR THAT TO HAPPEN FOR JOSH ALLEN AND BUFFALO ON THIRD AND 1 WITH A SHOCK TO TRY TO GET THE FIRST DOWN AND KEEP THE DRIVE MOVING. AL: WENT FOR IT ON FOURTH DOWN THE LAST TIME. OF COURSE THEY WERE DEEP IN MIAMI TERRITORY. SAM MARTIN, NOW IN HIS 12TH BERRIOS BACK. MAKES THE FAI NOT ME, BABY, THEY SLEEP IS A FOREIGN CONCEPT TO SOME OF OUR FRIENDS. BALL AT THE 16-YARD LINE. COMING OUT IN THE PISTOL ABOUT HALF THE TIME. HANDS THE BALL OFF TO ACHANE, GAIN OF ONE. KIRK: IT IS FUN TO WATCH TUA -- RUN THIS OFFENSE OF MIKE MCDANIEL. THE BALL HANDLING, HOW COMFORTABLE HE IS. HE IS TRYING TO AFFECT THE DEFENSE AS MUCH AS HE CAN WITH DIFFERENT WAYS OF CARRYING OUT FAKES, USING HIS EYES, MOVEMENT WITH HIS SHOULDERS. AL: DOLPHINS RUNNING THEIR 18TH PLAY. HERE COMES HILL. TYREEK HILL. FIRST DOWN AND A COUPLE MORE BEFORE HE IS FORCED OUT OF BOUNDS BY DAMAR HAMLIN. IT IS SO GREAT TO SEE HAMLIN BACK. YOU ALL KNOW THE STORY ABOUT THE CARDIAC ARREST IN CINCINNATI AT THE END OF THE SEASON, FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE. HERE HE IS. HE STARTED LAST WEEK. IT IS GREAT. KIRK: IT REALLY IS. YOU TALK TO BUFFALO, THE COACHES AND THE PLAYERS, THEY LOOK AT DAMAR HAMLIN LIKE HE IS PLAYING SAFETY AND IN A BIG ROLE BECAUSE OF THE LOSSES OF MICAH HYDE AND JORDAN POYER. HE HAS BIG SHOES TO FILL. AL: TUA BACK. TUA HAS TIME, OVERTHROWS, INTERCEPTED AT THE 50, THAT IS BENFORD WITH THE PICK. TUA NOW WITH TWO PICKS OPENING FRAME. KIRK: THE BIGGEST CONCERN WITH ODELL BECKHAM DOWN IS FINDING THE THIRD RECEIVER. MORE OF A VERTICAL THREAT, NOT ON THE SAME PAGE. TUA LIKES TO ANTICIPATE, GET THE BALL OUT EARLY. HE AND 84 ARE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE AND AN EASY INTERCEPTION FOR BENFORD. AL: HAD A PICK LAST YEAR IN THE LAST GAME OF THE SEASON. BUFFALO WON THAT GAME. THERE IS CHOSEN. HE USED TO GO BY THE NAME ROBBIE ANDERSON WHEN HE WAS WITH THE JETS. 41 SECONDS LEFT IN THE QUARTER. THIS TIME IT IS SHAKIR. BOTH TEAMS USING THEIR NUMBER 10 ON PLAYS, RUNNING PLAYS, HILL ON ONE SIDE, SHAKIR ON THE OTHER. HOLLAND MAKES THE TACKLE. SECOND DOWN KIRK: THAT IS ONE THING TO DO AGAINST A TEAM TO HAVE DOMINATED. YOU GET TURNOVERS EARLY IN PLUS TERRITORY. AL: BUFFALO WILL LET THE CLOCK RUN OUT AND WE WILL CHANGE SIDES OF THESTART THE SECOND QUARTER. AL MICHAELS, KIRK HERBSTREIT, KAYLEE HARTUNG. TUA THE FIRST TIME IN 55 CAREER GAMES WITH TWO PICKS IN FIRST QUARTER. THE GAME IS TIED, 7-7, SECOND DOWN AND 8. THE BILLS AT THE 42-YARD LINE. ALLEN. FAKES A THROW. PEOPLE TAKE OFF AND SLIDES TO A STOP AT THE 39-YARD LINE. JALEN RAMSEY FORCED THE ISSUE. WHEN HE SEES HIS GUYS COVERED, OFF HE GOES AND WE SEE THAT GREAT FREQUENCY. KIRK: DAVID LONG SAYING IF YOU DO THAT ONE TOO MANY TIMES, WE WILL KNOCK YOU OUT, KIND OF THING. THAT PUMP FAKE IS LEGENDARY. ANTHONY WEAVER TELLING HIS GUYS TO PLAY THROUGH HIS RIGHT HAND. DO NOT GET AIRBORNE ON THOSE PUMP FAKES. EASIER SAID THAN DONE. AL: THIRD DOWN AND 5. ALLEN FIRES AND IT IS SHAKIR MAKING THE GRAB TO MOVE. THE STICKS TACKLED BY DAVID LONG. SHAKIR IS THE ONLY WIDE RECEIVER ON THE ROSTER WHO HAD EVER CAUGHT A PASS FROM ALLEN COMING INTO THIS SEASON. KIRK: BESIDES THE TIGHT ENDS, JUST TO SKILL SET. LOOK AT THAT. NICE JOB SETTLING IN THE ZONE. HOW ABOUT THE PROTECTION BY THE OFFENSIVE LINE TO MAKE SURE HE HAD A CHANCE. YOU SEE HIM WORK THROUGH THE PROGRESSIONS TO MAKE THE THROW. AL: IN THE BACKFIELD. COOK ESCAPES THE FIRST MAN AND TURNS WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOSS INTO A NICE LITTLE GAIN. GOT AWAY FROM JALEN RAMSEY, WHO OF COURSE COVERS, CAN BLITZ AND CAN USUALLY STOP YOU IN THE BACKFIELD BUT NOT THAT TIME. KIRK: JALEN RAMSEY SEES MACK HOLLINS GOING IN MOTION AND HE WILL SHOOT UNDERNEATH. ANOTHER FLORIDA STATE ALUM, KEON COLEMAN, HE GETS UNDERNEATH AND AFFECTS THE PLAY. A PRETTY GOOD EFFORT BY JAMES COOK JUST TO KEEP THE PLAY ALIVE. AL: SECOND AND 7. CURTIS SAMUEL' CURTIS SAMUEL'S HEADING OUTSIDE AT THE 30 YARD LINE. ALLEN LOOKING LEFT, ALLEN THROWING LEFT TO SAMUEL AND BROKEN UP IN THE END ZONE. CURTIS SAMUEL, ONE OF THE NEW RECEIVERS, JORDYN BROOKS ABLE TO KNOCK IT AWAY. SAMUEL COMING OVER AS A FREE AGENT FROM THE COMMANDERS. KIRK: BROOKS IS A GUY WHO HAS THIS SKILL SET BECAUSE OF THE SPEED HE HAS. HE CAN RUN. THAT IS CURTIS SAMUEL, WHO CAN GO. NEVER GETS HIS HEAD AROUND TO LOOK AT THE FOOTBALL BUT HAS GOOD POSITION AND GETS THE LEFT ARM UP AT THE LAST SECOND. AL: THIRD AND 7. FOUR-MAN RUSH. ALLEN WITH TIME. INCOMPLETE. THROWS IT LOW. TRYING TO GET IT TO TY JOHNSON THE THIRD DOWN BACK. FOURTH DOWN, IN COMES THE FIELD GOAL UNIT TO ATTEMPT ABOUT A 45- YARD, 46-YARD FIELD GOAL. KIRK: ANTHONY WEAVER CHANGING UP THE LOOKS. SETTLED BACK IN ZONE. MOVED AFTER THE SNAP. HE GOT UNCOMFORTABLE AND ALL HE COULD DO WAS THROW IT AWAY. AL: SAM MARTIN TO HOLD IT. TYLER BASS TO KICK IT. AND FROM 43, IT IS RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE. 12:41 REMAINING IN THE FIRST HALF. HARD ROCK STADIUM, MIAMI GARDENS, FLORIDA. BUFFALO ON TOP, 10-7.10-7, BUFFA FIELD GOAL. WE HAVE HAD THREE KICKOFFS, ALL RESULTING IN TOUCHBACKS. SO MUCH FOR THE DYNAMIC KICKOFF. KIRK: TIME FOR THE TI FACTOR -- IT FACTOR, FUELED BY GATORADE. THE BUFFALO DEFENSE, DOWN SOMEBODY'S. ONE GUY WHO HAS STEPPED UP HIS GREAT JOB IN COVERAGE. LOOK AT THE EYES IN ZONE. GOOD JOB OF READING TUA. THE BALL IS OVERTHROWN. BENFORD DOES A GREAT JOB OF BEING THERE. HE IS OFF TO A GREAT NOT A LOT OF MAN-TO-MAN BUT PLAYING GREAT IN ZONE. GREAT AWARENESS. AL: JAYLEN WRIGHT, A ROOKIE OUT OF TENNESSEE, FOURTH ROUND PICK, IS IN THE GAME. BEHIND TUA. THERE HE GOES. PICKS UP ABOUT FOUR. THAT BUFFALO DEFENSE, DO NOT FORGET BERNARD, OUT, AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT. 54, BAYLON SPECTOR COMES IN. KIRK: SPECTOR, OUT OF CLEMSON, HAD A GREAT CAREER. TWO NEW SAFETIES, DAMAR HAMLIN AND TAYLOR RAPP. TARON JOHNSON IS OUT SO CAM LEWIS IS IN. HAVE A BACKUP LINEBACKER A LOT OF BACKUPS PLAYING IN BUFFALO. AL: MATT MILANO ON INJURED RESERVE. THROUGH THE MIDDLE, THERE GOES THE ROOKIE. WE HAVE A FLAG DOWN IN THE OFFENSIVE BACKFIELD. THAT WILL NEGATE THAT RUN. KIRK: I THINK IT WAS A CENTER, BREWER, ON A HOLD. REFEREE: HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER 72. 10 YARD PENALTY, SECOND DOWN. KIRK: ARMSTEAD, THE LEFT TACKLE. THE CENTER DEFINITELY GOT INVOLVED IN A HOLD HIMSELF. MCDANIEL FRUSTRATED. IT LOOKS LIKE TO HAVE SOME POSITIVE STEP FORWARD AND END UP GOING BACK. 72, IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR SCREEN, SEE HIM GET UNDERNEATH THE PADS OF ALL OF HER, WHICH IS TOUGH TO DO. ED OLIVER IS ONLY 6'1", NOT A BIG INTERIOR D-LINEMAN. AL: ARMSTEAD, 12TH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE. SECOND DOWN AND 17. TUA WITH A RIGHT-HANDED FLIP. TAKING OFF AND PICKING UP GOOD YARDAGE IS JONNU SMITH, THE TIGHT END. SETTING UP A THIRD DOWN AND MANAGEABLE AFTER A SECOND DOWN AND 17. KIRK: WE JUST TALKED ABOUT TUA DOING A GOOD JOB WITH HIS BALLHANDLING. HE GIVES A LITTLE LOOK AND THEN A NO LOOK FLICK WITH THE RIGHT, UNDERNEATH TO JONNU SMITH AND HE IS ABLE TO PICK UP SOME BIG YARDS. THEY HAVE A REAL SHOT NOW TO CONVERT. SMITH COMING OVER GIVES THEM A THREAT OF THE TIGHT END POSITION WHICH THEY HAVE NOT HAD IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. AL: TUA THROWS AND INCOMPLETE. A LOT OF TRAFFIC. TYREEK HILL WAS THE INTENDED RECEIVER. IT IS A FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A HOLD HERE AS HE TRIES TO WORK TO THE INSIDE. GRABS HIM UP TOP. SHUT UP, ERB STREET, YOU DON'T KNOW -- HERBSTREIT, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU' KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. TERRY SAID GOOD CALL. AL: JAKE BAILEY DOING THE PUNTING. BRANDON CODRINGTON BACK AND MAKES A FAIR CATCH AT THE 16-YARD LINE. 10:54 TRAFFIC STOP ONTHE WAY TO' SUNDAYS GAME. THEY HAVE RELEASED BODY CAM FOOTAGE OF HILL BEING FORCED OUT OF HIS CAR. HILL ACKNOWLEDGES HE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IN THE MOMENT BUT IS PUBLICLY CALLING FOR AN OFFICER TO BE FIRED. HE SAID HE WANTS THE INCIDENT TO BE A LEARNING TOOL FOR EVERYONE. AL: THAT WAS AN AMAZING SITUATION ON SUNDAY. PULLED OUT OF THE CAR, IS ABLE TO PLAY -- I DON'T KNOW IF ADRENALINE TAKE DINNER WHAT BUT HE HAD A GREAT DAY. HE HAD AN 80-YARD TOUCHDOWN RECEPTION. KIRK: I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT. AL: THE VIDEO IS UNBELIEVABLE. RAY DAVIS IS THE RUNNING BACK. THROW TO HIM. CHASED DOWN AT THE LINE OF CHOP ROBINSON MAKING THE TACKLE. SECOND AND 11. KIRK: RAY DAVIS IS A LEGITIMATE BACK AS A ROOKIE OUT OF KENTUCKY. HE ACTUALLY WENT TO THREE SCHOOLS -- TEMPLE, VANDY, AND KENTUCKY, HE HAD 1000 YARDS AT ALL THREE STOPS. JAMES COOK AND TY JOHNSON ALSO, VERY PHYSICAL. AL: SAMUEL SETS UP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. NOW YOU HAVE THE PASS OVER THE MIDDLE AND IT IS CAUGHT IN TRAFFIC. HERE COMES A FLAG AT THE END OF THE PLAY. IT WAS SECOND AND 11. MCDANIEL OBVIOUSLY INDICATING WHICH WAY HE WANTS IT TO GO. REFEREE: PERSONAL FOUL, UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS, DEFENSE, NUMBER 21. 15 YARD PENALTY, AUTOMATIC FIRST AL: THAT IS FORMER BILL AND CURRENT DOLPHIN, JORDAN POYER. HELMET TO HELMET. IN THE FLAG AND 15. KIRK: NOT JUST A PERSONAL FOUL. DO YOU SEE ANYTHING MORE? TERRY: I DON'T. IT LOOKS LIKE FORCIBLE HELMET TO HELMET CONTACT BUT I DO NOT THINK THEY WILL EXTEND THIS TO DISQUALIFICATION. KIRK: GREAT JOB OF HOLDING ONTO THE FOOTBALL. SHAKIR IS THE REAL DEAL IN THE SLOT FOR THESE GUYS. AL: SAMUEL GOES IN MOTION. HERE GOES DAVIS. THE MAN WHO WENT TO THREE SEPARATE SCHOOLS TAKES IT TO THE 44-YARD LINE, FOLLOWING DION DAWKINS, WHO IS NO STRANGER OF GOING TO THE PRO BOWL, 73. KIRK: JOB READY DOING A GREAT JOB OF MIXING UP THE LOOKS, NOT PUTTING IT ALL ON THE SHOULDERS OF JOSH ALLEN. AL: SECOND AND 2. A DEFENSIVE ALERT. THAT PLAYER DOES COME. RAY DAVIS, DOING IT ON THE GROUND. TAKES IT TO THE 31 AND A FIRST DOWN FOR THE BILLS. KIRK: WATCHING RAY DAVIS IN COLLEGE, I THINK JOE BRADY IS VERY EXCITED WITH WHAT HE CAN BRING. JAMES COOK IS ALREADY ONE OF THE MORE UNDERRATED BACKS IN THE COUNTRY. HE WAS IN COLLEGE AT GEORGIA AND HE IS IN THE NFL. WHEN YOU COULD HAVE TWO OR THREE GUYS FIRING, ESPECIALLY ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS WITH THE HUMIDITY AS HIGH AS IT IS, IT IS GREAT. AL: TEMPERATURE IN THE MID-80'S, HUMIDITY ALSO IN THE MID-80'S. NOTHING DOING, TAKEN DOWN BY DAVID LONG, MAKING IT SECOND AND KIRK: I WAS JUST ABOUT TO LOT OF TIMES WE GET CAUGHT UP IN ALL THE QUARTERBACKS AND THE SKILL, THIS OFFENSE OF LINE ON THE ROAD DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF PASS PROTECTION, MOVING PEOPLE AROUND AN OPENING SOME HOLES. A NICE JOB BY THE DOLPHINS ON THAT PLAY BUT FOR HOLDING THEIR OWN. AL: THE BILLS ARE ONE OF THE FEW TEAMS IN THE LEAGUE THAT HAD ALL FIVE OFFENSIVE LINEMEN START ALL GAMES LAST YEAR BUT THEY HAD TO MAKE SOME CHANGES THIS YEAR. THREE FLAGS. NUMBER 79. FIVE YARD PENALTY, STILL SECOND AL: THAT IS ON SPENCER BROWN. THAT IS BUFFALO'S FIRST PENALTY. MIAMI HAS BEEN FLAGGED TIMES. KIRK: MIAMI WALKED A LOT OF PEOPLE UP THERE. NOT CROSSING INTO THE NEUTRAL ZONE BUT SHOWING ANTICIPATION THEY ARE ABOUT TO COME. SPENCER BROWN ENDS UP LOSING IT AND IT COST THEM FIVE YARDS. AL: SECOND DOWN AND 16. ALLEN FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE. SHORT PICKUP. DAVID LONG IS RIGHT THERE. SHAKIR, THE RECEIVER. GAIN OF THREE -- A HARD-EARNED THREE. THIRD AND 13. HALFWAY THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER. LOW SNAP. DANCING. LOOKING DOWNFIELD. FIRING DOWNFIELD, CAUGHT AT THE 2-YARD LINE, THEY WILL MARKET AT THE 1-YARD LINE. ALLEN EXTENDS THE PLAY. TY JOHNSON IS THE THIRD DOWN BACK, SEND HIM OUT ON A PATTERN AND FIND HIM OUT THE KIRK: ANY TIME 17 TAKES OFF, IT SEEMS LIKE HE IS ALWAYS GOING TO HIS RIGHT. TY JOHNSON NOT GIVING UP AND DOING HIS JOB, GOING DOWN THE RIGHT SIDE LINE JUST TO GIVE HIM THAT OPTION JUST IN CASE. MIAMI LOSES TY JOHNSON. JALEN RAMSEY IN COVERAGE. AL: FIRST AND GOAL FROM THE 1-YARD LINE. INTO THE END ZONE. WALKING INTO THE END ZONE, JAMES COOK, FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. SO THE BUFFALO BILLS, WHO HAVE OWNED THE DOLPHINS, 11 WINS IN THEIR LAST 12 MEETINGS, NOT READY -- NOW READY TO TAKE WHAT WOULD BE A 10-POINT LEAD WITH THE EXTRA POINT. EIGHT PLAYS, 85 YARDS IN 4:30. KIRK: JOSH ALLEN BEING JOSH SCRAMBLING ON THAT BIG THIRD DOWN TO MAKE THE THROATED TY JOHNSON. WHAT A DRIVE. AL: BASS FOR THE EXTRA POINT. AND THE BUFFALO BILLS, ON THE ROAD, HAVE A 10-POINT LEAD WITH 6:25. THAT WAS NOT THE CASE LAST YEAR WHAT WE HAVE THE JETS TWICE, NEVER SAW AARON. THE JETS AT HOME AGAINST THE PATRIOTS ON THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL NEXT WEEK. 17-7. KIRK: BACK TO BACK TRIPS. AL: WE WILL HAVE THE GIANTS AND THE COWBOYS THE FOLLOWING WEEK. BASS NOW TO KICK OFF. SO MUCH FOR THE DYNAMIC KICKOFF, WHICH HAS TOTALLY FIZZLED TONIGHT. FIVE KICKOFF, FIVE TOUCHBACKS. KIRK: FOR THOSE JUST TUNING IN, TUA HAS BEEN OFF TO A ROUGH START, NOT ABLE TO GET THE RHYTHM GOING THAT YOU TYPICALLY SEE WITH THEM, MIKE MCDANIEL AND THE RECEIVERS. BUFFALO IS DOING A GOOD JOB OF PLAYING ZONE, FORCING HIM TO GO TO OTHER OPTIONS BESIDES TYREEK HILL AND JAYLEN WADDLE. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ON THE SAME PAGE. THEY GOT A TOUCHDOWN ON A 10-PLAY DRIVE THEY HAD TO EARN. TWO INTERCEPTIONS. MIKE MCDANIEL TALKED ABOUT HIS MENTAL TOUGHNESS. IT IS BEING TESTED. AL: STARTING FROM THE 30 YARD STARTING ON THE GROUND. A GREAT GAIN BY ACHANE. FIX UP 17 OUT TO THE 47-YARD LINE, STOPPED BY HAMLIN. KIRK: GREAT BLOCK BY THE RIGHT TACKLE, AUSTIN JACKSON. ALSO, THE LEFT GUARD, ROBERT, COMING AROUND. THAT HOLE OPENED UP IN A HURRY. IT IS GOOD TO SEE ACHANE GET THE CHANCE TO HIT THE WHOLE GOING DOWNHILL IN A HURRY. AL: UNDER SIX TO PLAY IN THE FIRST HALF. FIRST DOWN AT THE 47-YARD LINE. THROUGH THE MIDDLE AGAIN. NICE TOUGH RUN ACROSS THE 50 TO THE 48-YARD LINE OF THE BILLS. SECOND DOWN. KIRK: SPECTOR INVOLVED IN THE TACKLE, HE AND WILLIAMS HOLDING IT DOWN WITH BERNARD OUT OF THE FOOTBALL GAME. SO FAR MIKE MCDANIEL AND MIAMI NOT ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. TRYING TO EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION WITH A LOT OF PRE-SNAP MOVEMENT, MAKE THE DEFENSE JUST ON THE FLIGHT, ESPECIALLY ON A SHORT WAIT BUT BUFFALO IS HOLDING UP SO FAR. AL: SECOND AND 5. AGAIN. NICE LITTLE MOVE THERE, A LITTLE SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN. MCDANIEL EACH OF THE LAST TWO YEARS -- I HAVE DONE THE NFL FOR 39 YEARS, HE IS A BIRD OF A VERY DIFFERENT FEATHER. YOU ASKED IF I COULD RELATE ANYONE TO HIM, NO, AND I THINK I HAVE KNOWN EVERY COACH IN THE LEAGUE FOR FOUR DECADES. KIRK: YOU SEE IN HIS INTERVIEWS. WE HAD HIM WITH OUR TEAM. HE DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE. AL: NO. KIRK: HE WAS ENJOYING HANGING OUT AND TALKING FOOTBALL. AL: 1000%. THIRD AND 1. TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING. THIS TIME HE GETS STUFF, INGOLD WITH A SECONDARY. THAT IS DORIAN WILLIAMS. FOURTH DOWN. FOURTH DOWN AT THE 45-YARD LINE, THAT IS A LOSS OF ONE. FOURTH AND A DEUCE. RK: BERNARD IS NOT IN THERE, WHO IS GOING TO STEP UP? DORIAN WILLIAMS, ALMOST BUILT LIKE A SAFETY BUT PLAYS LINEBACKER. HE IS LEADING THE WAY IN THE MIDDLE. AL: FOURTH AND 2. THEY LINE UP TO GO FOR IT. EMPTY THE BACKFIELD. TAGOVAILOA UNDER PRESSURE AND HE WILL BE SACKED AT THE 48-YARD ED OLIVER BURSTING THROUGH. NOT ONLY DO THEY TURN IT OVER, THEY TURN IT OVER IN THEIR OWN 3:45 UNTIL HALFTIME, THE BILLS UP BY 10 AND WITH THE BALL. ACKFIELD AND COMES UP WITH THE SACK. HE PLAYED WITH SOME FIRE AND EMOTION ON THAT FORTH AND 2 TO GET THE BILLS THE BALL BACK. AL: MIAMI HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE. FOUR DAYS AGO THEY WERE DOWN 14 AND THAT IS WHEN TUA MADE THE SPEECH IN THE LOCKER ROOM. THEY HIT THE DAILY -- SCORED AT THE END OF THE FIRST HALF AND THEN GOT THE BALL TO START THE SECOND HALF AND SCORED AGAIN. BUFFALO AT THE 49-YARD LINE. ON THE GROUND. BREAKING TACKLES, JAMES COOK! INSIDE THE 20, INSIDE THE 5, SOMERSAULTS FOR THE TOUCHDOWN! WHOA! CALL IT 49 YARDS. SO, ALL GETS THE BIG SACK, TURN IT OVER, ONE PLAY AND A TOUCHDOWN. KIRK: THIS GUY, COOK, IS A FOOTBALL PLAYER. WHAT A WAY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TURNOVER ON DOWNS. THIS PLAY -- WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THIS, AL -- TALK ABOUT ZONE BLOCKING. YOU SEE DOUBLE-TEAMS, THIS IS A TRIPLE-TEAM THAT OPENED THE HOLE UP. AL: BASS WITH THE EXTRA POINT. TAKE A LOOK. KIRK: SPENCER BROWN, TORRENCE, CONNOR MCGOVERN, THEY TAKE AWAY THE INTERIOR. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT 11, DAVID LONG IS THINKING. LOSES HIS FOOTING AND DOES NOT FIT THE GAP AT ALL. JORDAN POYER TAKES IT FOR ANGLE. THAT IS SPEED FROM JAMES ONCE HE GETS TO THE OUTSIDE, THERE IS NO ONE LEFT TO SLOW HIM WHAT A PLAYER APPEARED AL: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT COOK, PROBABLY UNDERRATED. PROBABLY A LITTLE UNDERRATED BECAUSE YOU THINK HIS BROTHER, GALVIN -- DALVIN, WAS A STAR WITH MINNESOTA AND NOW IS ON THE DALLAS PRACTICE WHAT. KIRK: HIS FAMILY IS HERE. A LOT OF EMOTION FOR HIM TO COME BACK AND BE THE GUY. THAT IS 10 POINTS OFF TURNOVERS AND SEVEN MORE ON THE TURNOVER ON DOWNS. AL: A 17-POINT BUFFALO LEAD. TYLER BASS. KICKOFF NUMBER SIX. TOUCHBACK NUMBER SIX. EASTERN ON PRIME. KIRK: I THOUGHT YOU MADE A GREAT POINT WITH WHAT MIAMI FACED A WEEK AGO. A DIFFERENT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES BUT TO BE DOWN 14. THEY TALKED ABOUT HAVING TO COME JALEN RAMSEY SAID THEY HAD EACH OTHER'S BACK. HERE THEY ARE AGAIN. 17 DOWN IN THE FIRST HALF. LET'S SEE WHAT THEY DO TO TRY TO CLIMB BACK IN THE FOOTBALL GAME. AL: BUFFALO WAS ALSO DOWN 14 LAST WEEK AT ONE POINT AND OVERCAME THAT. NO GAIN FOR WADDLE. TACKLED THERE AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE BY CAM LEWIS. SECOND AND 10. KIRK: IT FEELS LIKE FROM UP HERE THAT BUFFALO IS PLAYING WITH A CHIP ON THEIR SHOULDER WITH SOME NEW FACES. THEY DO NOT HAVE THEIR SAFETY FROM LAST YEAR, PLAYING WITH RAPP AND HAMLET. YOU SAW CAM LEWIS MAKE A PLAY. THEY SEEM LIKE THEY ARE PLAYING WITH A BIT OF AN ATTITUDE, WHIC I LOVE. AL: PLAYING WITH A SHORT DECK AND DOMINATING. BLITZ COMING, LOOK OUT. THE PASS IS CAUGHT FOR A FIRST 12 YARDS. KIRK: THEY BRING THE BLITZ. SPECTER IS COMING. WATCH TO THE OUTSIDE. THEY ARE GETTING UPFIELD, VON MILLER. HE ALMOST GETS IN THE WAY OF THIS FOOTBALL. PERFECTLY TIMED TO GET THE BALL OUT QUICKLY WITH THE MIDDLE LINEBACKER ON THE BLITZ. DOES NOT HAVE TIME TO GET TO THE LACES. WITH THE SPEED OF ACHANE, HE GETS THE FIRST DOWN. AL: FIRST DOWN. AGAIN, THEY KEEP IT ON THE GROUND UP TO THE 46. PRETTY MUCH TAKING THE CROWD OUT OF THE GAME. THERE IS NO CHANCE FOR A 2-FOR-1 FOR MIAMI. BUFFALO DEFERRED. THEY WILL GET THE BALL IN THE SECOND HALF. THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE TWO- THE BUFFALO BILLS DOMINATING IN MIAMI. ANG COMING UP AT THE BREAK. SO, LET'S SEE IF MIAMI CAN GET SOMETHING HAPPENING HERE IN THE LAST TWO MINUTES, 2ND DOWN AND SEVEN, WILL KEEP IT ON THE INTO THE 49 YARD LINE GOES ACHANE. SPECTOR TAKING THE PLACE OF BERNARD WHO GOT HURT. KIRK: SPECTOR HAS GOOD SPEED. HE PLAYED AT CLEMSON, WAS ASKED TO DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS, BLITZING, COVERING. SO, HE IS MORE THAN CAPABLE OF OWNING HIS -- OF HOLDING HIS OWN. CAN HE GET LINED UP IN THE RIGHT SPOT AND DEAL WITH THE SPEED AND THE CONFUSION THIS OFFENSE CAN CREATE? AL: THE CROWD IS GETTING A LITTLE RESTLESS WITH THE LACK OF URGENCY, DOWN BY 17. A COUPLE OF RUNS, 3RD DOWN AND 2, AND THAT WILL MOVE THE STICKS BUT IT IS JUST A SHORT GAME. SMITH MAKES THE CATCH. CROWD DOESN'T LIKE THE PLAY CALLING ON THIS DRIVE. KIRK: THEY GOT ALL THREE TIMEOUTS. THAT IS WHY YOU'RE NOT SEEING THE URGENCY BUT YOU'RE RIGHT. AND THEY NEED A TOUCHDOWN WHEN THE BILLS GET THE BALL. AL: ALMOST IF THEY ARE READING TO GET INTO THE LOCKER ROOM AND REGROUP AND TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT. ACHANE, A SHORT GAME, UNDER A MINUTE, SECOND DOWN BUT AGAIN BUFFALO WILL GET THE BALL WHEN WE START THE SECOND HALF. KIRK: WE KEEP GOING BACK TO THIS TEAM WITH BUFFALO, ON A SHORT WEEK, SITTING BACK WITH THEIR TWO SAFETY IS TRYING TO TAKE AWAY THOSE EASY SHOTS, TRYING TO AFFECT THE TIMING AND THE RHYTHM. WITH THE SHORT UNDERNEATH PASSING, GETTING AFTER THESE IT HAS BEEN WORKING SO FAR. AL: ON TEAM WITH HILL AND OF YARDS AFTER THE CATCH. THE CLOCK RUNS, SHORT. A LITTLE TOSSED BACK HERE. THAT'S GOING TO GO NOWHERE AND THAT LOOK RELATABLE A LOT OF CONSTERNATION -- THAT WILL CREATE A LOT OF CONSTERNATION IN THE AUDIENCE. 3RD DOWN AND 12. KIRK: I'M SURPRISED THESE TIMEOUTS ARE NOT BEING USED. ED ED OLIVER IN THIS MIDDLE OF THIS DEFENSE. WHETHER HE'S ON THE RIGHT SIDE OR THE LEFT SIDE, THAT TIME BEGINS I CO BEGINS I CANBERG. AL: THEY WILL USE THE TIMEOUT BUT :32, AL: KIRK, THIS IS THE COUNT -- YOU TELL ME. THIS IS THE KIND OF DRIVE THAT YOU RUN OUT THE CLOCK. KIRK: THE TWO MINUTE WARNING, NOT USING THE TIMEOUTS. I THINK EVERYONE'S KIND OF SURPRISE, NOT TO MENTION THEY HAD TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS DRIVE WITH BUFFALO GETTING THE BALL. AL: LIKE THEY' AL: LIKE THEY'RE PLAYING DEFENSE. AND IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW. AFRAID SOMETHING BAD IS GOING TO HAPPEN. TUS FL TUS A FLUSHED OUT. HE'S GOING TO KEEP IT AND RUN WITH IT AND GET THE FIRST DOWN. THE CROWD LIKES THAT BUT THAT SECONDARY DID ITS JOB. GOT HILL OUT THERE AND SMITH, A LOT OF GUYS THAT CAN REALLY BUST IT OPEN. KIRK: TYREEK HILL CHECKING OUT AND YOU HAVE GOT DEBOSE WHO MADE A MISTAKE NOT GETTING HIS HEAD TURNED AROUND AND THAT COST OF TURNOVER. THE REASON THEY GO TO THE BIGGER RECEIVERS AS THEY HAVE TO TRY TO GET THE BALL DOWNFIELD. ALSO ROBBIE CHOSEN IN AGAIN. AL: 27 SECONDS. THAT'S WILSON IN MOTION. CATCHES IT. GETS TO THE 29 YARD LINE. THEY HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS. CLOCK RUNS A COUPLE OF SECONDS FURTHER. THEN THEY CALL IT RIGHT HERE. SECOND AND 4. KIRK: REALLY, YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT YARDS AFTER THE CATCH. THE PROBLEM IS THAT BUFFALO IS DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB OF RUNNING THE FOOTBALL, TAKING AWAY SOME OF THE SPACE THEY ARE USED TO WORKING WITH UNDERNEATH THERE. DIDN' DIDN'T WE HAVE TWO QUARTERBACKS LAST WEEK THROW FOR OVER 300 YARDS? AL: THAT'S IT. TUA AND MATTHEW STAFFORD LOSING THE BATTLE AGAINST DETROIT. THAT'S INTERESTING. TWO GUYS. THERE WAS MORE RUNNING IN THE FIRST WEEK THEN THERE HAS BEEN IN YEARS AND LESS PASSING. AGAIN, THAT IS A TINY SAMPLE SIZE. KIRK: WE'LL SEE. BUT WE ARE SEEING IT AGAIN TONIGHT WITH BUFFALO'S DEFENSE. FORCING THE SHORT PASSING GAME, YARDS AFTER THE CATCH, MAKE YOU HAVE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL. AL: AND MIAMI'S RUN 36 PLAYS, 20 RUNS, 16 PASSES. 2ND AND 4. FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE. THAT'S CALL. -- THAT'S CAUGHT. HILL TACKLED AND YOU HAVE THE CLOCK STOPPING AT :16. AND YOU ARE NOW OUT OF TIMEOUTS. YOU BRING IN YOUR FIELD GOAL KICKER WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING THEY WILL NEED HERE. SANDERS HAS MADE HIS LAST SIX. HE'S A GOOD ONE. KIRK: WELL, THERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE SEEN IN THIS FIRST HALF. TO GET THE BALL OUT IN A HURRY AND YOU GET IT TO YOUR GUY, TYREEK HILL AND HIS SOON AS HE CATCHES THE BALL YOU HAVE TWO OR THREE BUFFALO DEFENDERS NOT ALLOWING HIM TO GET AN ANGLE TO GET OUT IN THE SPACE. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY DIALED UP THIS WEEK AND HOPING TO TAKE AWAY THE POTENTIAL WITH THE BIG PLAY LIKE YOU SAID IF THEY THROW IT UNDERNEATH. LET HIM TRY TO GET LOOSE. THREE WHITE JERSEYS THEIR RUNNING THE BALL. NOW HE'S GOT TO CAREFUL WITHOUT THE TIMEOUTS. GOT TO GET OUT IN A HURRY. AL: EXACTLY. HILL IS WIDE RIGHT. AND YOU HAVE A TIMEOUT TAKEN BY THE DEFENSE. SEAN MCDERMOTT. A LOT OF SUCCESS IN BUFFALO. HE SAYS, HE'S GOT TO BE OPTIMIST. BUT HE HAS BEEN IN THE PLAY OF SIX TIMES IN SEVEN SEASON AND HELPED TURN THAT FRANCHISE AROUND. KIRK: THE PREVIOUS 20 YEARS, THEY'D ONLY BEEN TO THE PLAYOFFS A COUPLE TIMES. I THINK HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB. IT IS A MATTER OF TAKING THE NEXT STEP. I LIKE THE FACT HE TALKED WITH US ABOUT GOING BACK TO BEING THE HEAD COACH AND BEING THERE FOR THE TEAM. LAST YEAR KIND OF SET THE BAR AND SHOWING THE ASSISTANTS AND SHOWING THE TEAM AS THE PLAY CALLER ON THE DEFENSE BUT IT TAKES TIME TO GET THAT READY. NOW HE IS RELYING ON BOBBY BABBAGE AND BRANDON BEANE THE GM. BUT THEY FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS TEAM. LIKE I SAID, IF THEY CAN MAINTAIN THIS COLLECTIVE CHIP THEY ARE PLAYING WITH, THERE IS A REASON FOR OPTIMISM. AL: COMING DOWN HERE ON THE ROAD, HOT NIGHT. LEADING BY 17. TUA TO THE OUTSIDE AND STEPPING OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 15 YARD LINE IS SMITH. NOW AT :12. AGAIN, WITH NO TIMEOUTS YOU HAVE TO WORK THE EDGES OR THE END ZONE. KIRK: I THINK BUFFALO AGAIN TRYING TO KEEP IT IN FRONT. THEY PROBABLY GAVE UP A FEW MORE NOW TUA POTENTIALLY HAS A COUPLE OF SHOTS INTO THE END ZONE HERE. AL: 12TH PLAY OF A DRIVE. FIVE RUNS, SIX PASSES. [WHISTLE] NOW YOU GOT ANOTHER TIMEOUT. >> FINAL TIMEOUT. AL: BUFFALO TAKES THIS ONE, AFTER THEY LOOKED AT THE ALIG NMENT. STEVE ROSS IS THE OWNER OF THE MIAMI DOLPHINS. USUALLY SUCCESSFUL IN THE REAL ESTATE WORLD AND OF COURSE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, MANAGING GENERAL PARTNER. HE'S WATCHED HIS TEAM GO TO THE PLAYOFFS LAST TWO -- LAST YEAR THEY LOST TO BUFFALO AT THE END OF THE SEASON HERE IT HAD THEY WON, THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO GO TO KANSAS CITY AND GO TO ICE STATION ZEBRA FOR THAT WILD CARD GAME. IN WHICH KANSAS CITY WON. BUT THAT WAS A VERY VERY COSTLY KIRK: I JUS KIRK: I JT FELT LIKE THE LAST THREE OR FOUR WEEKS OF THE SEASON THEY WERE LIMPING HOME. THEY DID NOT LOOK LIKE, THAT WAS A BIG EMPHASIS FOR THEM IS BEING ABLE TO BE THE SAME TEAM FOR 17 WEEKS. KIRK: LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, HOT START, NOT SO HOT FINISH. TUA TO THE OUTSIDE AND THROWS THAT ONE AWAY. THIRD DOWN. NOW YOU GOT :08. AND, OF COURSE, THE BILLS ARE TAKING THE END ZONE AWAY. AS BEST THEY CAN. THEY WILL SEND IN THE FIELD GOAL UNIT. SANDERS WON LAST WEEK'S GAME AT THE GUN. THAT WAS THE ONLY GAME IN THAT WAS THE ONLY GAME I-- THE ONLY TIME IN THE GAME THAT THE DOLPHINS HAD THE LEAD. 0:00. KICK THE 52 YARDER. THIS IS A CHIP SHOT FOR HIM. 34 YARDS. AND THE KICK IS GOOD. SO, LAST YEAR, WEEK 18, CALEBL SO, LAST YEAR, WEEK 18, CALEB WH THAT NIGHT WILL TELL YOU. WITH :04 TO GO, IT'S 14 POINT GA ME. SO AGAIN, THE DOLPHINS IN A SITUATION THAT THEY WERE IN LAST WEEK AGAINST THE JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS. SO, WILL WE SEE ANOTHER TOUCHBACK? MAYBE NOT THIS TIME. HE MAY WANT THE CLOCK TO RUN OUT WITH THE SHORT -- I HAVE AN IDEA AT THE END OF THE FIRST HALF. I HAVE TWO. NUMBER ONE, THE TOUCHBACK COMES AFTER THE 35 YARD LINE. NOT A BAD IDEA. OR MAKE THE KICKER GO BACK TO THE 30 YARD LINE. KIRK: THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. AL: THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT. KIRK: I THINK EVERYBODY, THINK ABOUT WHAT BUFFALO DEALT WITH, YOU TAKE THE 10 POINT LEAD LAST WEEK THEY THINK THEY'RE IN GOOD SHAPE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THE ANSWER IS, WE KICK IT INTO THE END ZONE AND LET THEM START THE 30. AL: ABSOLUTE. THE AVERAGE START LAST YEAR IS -- WAS AT THE 26. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE? THAT IS THE END OF THE FIRST HALF DOMINATED BY THE VISITORS. TUA HAD 13 COMPLETIONS, 18 ATTEMPTS, 97 YARDS. 24-10, AND WE GO TO KAYLEE. KAYLEE: YOUR OFFENSE LIKES TO SAY THAT EVERYBODY EATS. >> WELL, EVERYONE JUST THEIR JOB. WE GOT TO CONTINUE WITH THIS. THIS TEAM IS POTENT ON OFFENSE. AND SPECIAL TEAMS. KAYLEE: BUT ON DEFENSE EVEN WITH THE INJURIES THAT YOU HAVE, HAVE YOU BE -- HOW IF YOU BEEN ABLE TO NEUTRALIZE MIAMI'S BIG-PLAY ABILITY? >> GUYS ARE MAKING PLAYS, GETTING THE BALL MAYBE THEY CAN GET THAT IS WHAT THEY HAVE GOT TO DO. AL: BILLS WILL GET THE BALL. SANDERS TO KICK IT OFF. EVERY KICK OFF TONIGHT HAS RESULTED IN A TOUCHBACK. THIS TIME WE' THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO SEE A RUN BACK. STOP THE PRESSES, FROM THE 4 YARD LINE AND BRINGING IT BACK OUT TO THE 27 YARD LINE IS. RAY MOMENTS AGO, KAYLLE ON THE FIELD WITH MIKE MCDANIEL. KAYLEE: YOU ARE DOWN DOUBLE DIGITS FOR HIS SECOND GAME IN A ROW. >> YOU KNOW, THERE WAS CONSTRUCTIVE ENERGY. I THINK OUR FOOTBALL TEAM IS SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW. THE TURNOVER BATTLE, WE HAVE TO BE A LOT CLEANER AND HOW WE OPERATE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SOME PLAYS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BALL. AND WE DIDN'T EASY. KAYLEE: DID YOU SEE THE RESPONSE AND THE CHALLENGE FROM YOUR QUARTERBACK DURING THE HALF THAT YOU SAW LAST WEEK. >> ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THERE WAS COMFORT TO A DEGREE IN THE FACT THAT THIS IS NOT UNCHARTED TERRITORY FOR SECOND GAME. GUYS WERE PRETTY -- OFF IN THIS SITUATION. WE'LL SEE WHAT WE DO WITH IT. AL: ALL RIGHT. THAT WAS MCDANIEL MOMENTS AGO. THEY START THIS DRIVE, THE BILLS DO, TO THE OUTSIDE. STAYING IN BOUNDS. FOR EXTRA YARDAGE IS DALTON KINCAID. MIKE JUST SAID YOU ARE DOWN 3-0 IN THE TURNOVERS BUT OFFICIALLY IT IS ONLY TWO, BUT THE FOURTH DOWN THING DOES NOT COUNT AS A TURNOVER BUT IT MIGHT AS WELL. KIRK: THAT IS 17 POINTS, LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT. HE SAID WHAT WE SAID. TAKE CARE THE FOOTBALL. FIRST THING THEY GOT TO DO TACKLE. GET A STOP HERE AGAINST JOSH WHO IS AN OFFENSIVE LINE THAT HAD A -- AGAINST JOSH ALLEN WHO HAD AN OFFENSIVE LINE THAT HAD A HECK OF A FIRST HALF. AL: SECOND AND 1. GET ABOUT FIVE. JAMES COOK NOW HAVING A HECK OF A NIGHT, HAS CARRIED THE BALL SIX TIMES FOR 65 YARDS. KIRK: BIG THING THAT HE LIKES TO DO, WE SAW IT LAST YEAR WERE THEN WHAT WOULD BRING IN DAVID EDWARDS. ON THE LEFT SIDE, ALEC ANDERSON AND HIS SECOND YEAR OUT OF UCLA GIVES HIM THAT SHORT YARDAGE AND I LOVE THE PATIENCE. JAMES COOK TALKED WITH THIS COACH IS HE MISSED A FEW PLAYS LAST WEEK. THE VISION WAS NOT THERE. HE HAS SOME GOOD ONES AND BAD ONES BUT TONIGHT HE'S BEEN VERY GOOD. AL: QUICK STAR OUTSIDE. COMING BACK INSIDE, PICKING U FEW. CURTIS SAMUEL TAKES IT TO THE 50 SECOND AND 7. DAVID LONG MAKES THE STOP. THERE IS WEAVER. WEAVER AND MCDANIEL GO BACK TO THE HOUSTON TEXANS A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. KIRK: FAMILIARITY, OF COURSE. AND WE TALKED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BROADCAST HOW ANTHONY WEAVER REALLY BEING A FORMER PLAYER WITH THE RAVENS, FITS IN PERFECTLY WITH THE CULTURE THAT MIKE MCDANIEL HAS HERE. AL: 2ND AND 7 FROM MIDFIELD AND SLIPPING FROM THE LOCAL WAS JAMES COOK. JORDYN BROOKS, TOOK THE LOGO AT MIDFIELD AND IS MORE SLIPPERY THAN THE GRASS ITSELF. KIRK: HERE IS A BIG OPPORTUNITY. THIS IS WHAT I'M SURE THEY TALKED ABOUT AT HALFTIME. IF THEY ARE MIAMI, WE ARE DOWN 14. WE WERE HERE LAST WEEK. PART OF BEING ABLE TO FIGHT BACK AND WIN A FOOTBALL GAME IS IT SHOWS A NEW GROUP, HEY, WE CAN DO THIS. GET IN THERE AT HALFTIME, WE WERE HERE LAST WEEK. LET'S DO THIS. LET'S GET A STOP AND GET THE BALL BACK TO TUA. AL: TIMEOUT IS CALLED BY THE DOLPHINS. SOME OTHER THINGS YOU DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO DO DOWN BY 14 IS WASTE OR USE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT A TIMEOUT IN THE FIRST COUPLE MINUTES OF THE THIRD CORPORATE KIRK: THIRD CORPORATE K-- THE THIRD KIRK: 2 GUYS ON THE FIELD. THEY COULD NOT AFFORD THE PENALTY, SO THEY HAD TO USE THE TIMEOUT. I' I'M SURE A BIG PART OF A DIVISIONAL MATCH UP EARLY IN THE YEAR, A BIG PART OF MCDANIEL'S, SOME OF THE LEADERS ON THE TEAM, WE HAVE TO MATCH THE INTENSITY THIS BILLS TEAM SHOWED UP WITH LET'S NOT WAIT. LET'S TAKE THE FIGHT TO THEM. ON OUR TURF. WE ARE HERE IN MIAMI. DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THAT IN THE AL: MM-MM. THIRD AND 7. BRINGING THAT THIRD DOWN KIRK: GET THE ROOKIE ROBINSON UP TO THE LEFT. HE HAS GOT GREAT SPEED. AL: CAN HE GET THROUGH? ALLEN IS CHASED. ALLEN THROWS AND ALLEN THROWS UP BEHIND MARCUS SCALING. CAME OVER FROM KANSAS CITY. FULLER COVERING. PRESSURE WAS PUT ON ALAN. AND MY AND MIAMI SECOND HALF STOP. KIRK: THEY SHOWED BLITZ, AND END UP BACKING OUT, A LITTLE TWIST WITH ROBINSON. HE WOWED A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH HIS SPEED AND WHAT HE CAN DO, THE ROOKIE OUT OF PENN STATE. THAT TIME JUST RUSHING JOSH ALLEN, NOT ALLOWING HIM TO MAKE THAT ACCURATE THROW AGAINST THE DOLPHINS DEFENSE OFF THE FIELD. AL: ROBINSON THE FIRST ROUND PICK. A PUNT HERE FROM MARTIN. FAIR CATCH IS CALLED FOR AND MADE AT THE 11 YARD LINE BY BER KIRK: IT WAS A TOUGH FIRST HALF OF THE MIAMI OFFENSE. NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND WAYS TO GET TYREEK HILL THE FOOTBALL AS OFTEN AS YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY. SIMILAR TO LAST WEEK. AND A LOT OF THIS HAS BEEN, YOU SEE MAN CAVERNS BUT A LOT OF IT - -MAN COVERAGE, BUT A LOT OF IT HAS BEEN ZONE. THEY BEEN KEEPING SAFETY'S OVERTOP TO HELP THEM. REMEMBER LAST WEEK AGAINST JACKSONVILLE, JUST WHEN YOU THINK JACKSONVILLE IS DOING A GREAT JOB, BANG. ONE PLAY AND YOU SEE AN 80 YARD TOUCHDOWN BY TYREEK HILL. THAT IS WHAT MIAMI IS BANKING ON, FINDING WAYS TO GET 17 AND 10 LOOSE. AL: FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH, LESTER COTTON IS IN PLACE OF ROBERT JONES. SEE IF THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE UP FRONT. WILLIAMS MAKES THE TACKLE ON KAYLEE: GUYS, WE JUST LEARNED THAT MIAMI IS LEFT GUARD ROB JONES IS QUESTIONABLE BECAUSE OF A SHOULDER INJURY. THAT IS WHY YOU SEE LESTER COTTON. HE HAS HIS HELMET IN HIS HAND BUT IN A LONG CONVERSATION WITH A TRAINER AND WE GOT CONFIRMATION FROM THE BILLS THAT THEIR MIDDLE LINEBACKER, THEIR LEADING TACKLER BERNARD WILL NOT RETURN TO THIS GAME. BECAUSE OF A PECTORAL INT JURY. AL: HE WENT OUT WITH THAT IN THE BUT THEY HAVE WITHSTOOD ABOUT EVERYTHING ON DEFENSE. PASS -- ACHANE, HE'LL GALLOP HIS WAY FOR A FIRST DOWN PAST THE 20 YARD LINE. KIRK: SOME SPACE FINALLY FOR ONE OF THEIR SPEEDSTERS TO WORK WITH. HE LOOKS DOWN FIELD. GOOD LOOK AT HIGH SKY TO GET A FEEL FOR THE LEFT-HAND SIDE. SEE THE BILLS SINKING. THAT IS THE PLAN, YOU SAW HIM LOSE HIS FEEDING, CHRISTIAN BENFORD. EYES DOWNFIELD. CHECK IT. THAT IS BEEN A BIG EVAN:. REMEMBER ON OUR CALL WITH MIKE MCDANIEL, HE SAID WE WANT YOU TO FEEL COMFORTABLE CHECKING IT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ALWAYS THROW IT AND TUA HAS REALLY BOUGHT INTO THAT. AL: ON THE GROUND HERE LOOKING FOR SOME SPACE. FOR ACHANE. KIRK: THINK THAT IS WORTH WATCHING WITH COTTON IN FOR JONES WITH THE INJURY. BECAUSE THEIR STARTING LEFT GUARD IS ON THE PUTT, HE'S UNABLE TO PLAY. YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY DOWN ONE OF YOUR THIRD LEFT GUARD AND ED OLIVER HAD HIS WAY MANY TIMES OF ROBERT JONES IN THAT FIRST HALF. SO KEEP AN EYE ON THE INTERIOR OF THAT MIAMI OFFENSIVE LINE HE DACRON JONES AND ED OLIVER. AND YOU HAVE COME A LAMB COMING OFF THE BENCH. NUMBER 70. -- KEMBA LAMB. 2ND AND 6, ON THE GROUND TO GET UP TO THE 30 YARD LINE TO SET UP A THIRD AND MEDIUM. SO THE MIAMI DOLPHINS, 23 RUNS ALREADY. WILLIAMS MAKES THE STOP IT KIRK: YOU HEAR SOME OF THE MEMBERS IN THE BACKGROUND FOR SOME OF THE BOOING FROM THE FANS. THEY WANT MIKE MCDANIEL TO GIVE TYREEK HILL THE BALL. IT IS TOUGH TO DO WITH THOSE SAFETY'S BACK. THAT IS WHY THEY'RE RUNNING THE FOOTBALL. THEIR ANSWER IS RUN THE CREATE SPACE UNDERNEATH, AND TRY TO HAVE THAT YARDS AFTER T CATCH. A BIG THIRD DOWN. AL: 3RD AND 5. JEFF WILSON 23 IN THE GAME. TUA PRESSURED LOOKED OUT, FORCED TO THROW AND IT WILL BE DEPICT OFF ALONG THE SIDELINE! INGRAM UNTOUCHED. SO, TUA UNDER PRESSURE TRYING TO THROW IT AWAY NOT FAR ENOUGH. AND ON RUN BACK FOR A SCORE. HE PUT THE HEAT ON. LESTER COTTON COMING IT LEFT GUARD. YOU ALSO JUST HAD A BACKUP LEFT TACKLE AND NUMBER70. SO YOU HAVE TWO NEW PLAYERS TO OPEN THE DRIVE UP ON THE LEFT SIDE AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE THE PRESSURE COMES FROM. AND I THINK TUA DID EVERYTHING HE COULD TO TRY TO BE ABLE TO THROW THIS BALL AWAY. HE JUST DOESN'T GET ENOUGH ON THROWS IT UP IN THE AIR, AND THERE ONCE AGAIN IS A BUFFALO BILL. INGRAM MADE A GREAT PLAY EARLY WITH AN INTERCEPTION. THIS TIME STEPS IN FRONT AND HAS A PICK SIX. AL: PLAYED FOR THE BUFFALO BULLS, UNIVERSITY OF BUFFALO. SO, HE STAYED HOME. GETS THE TOUCHDOWN, EXTRA POINT IS GOOD. AND BUFFALO NOW WITH A THRE TOUCHDOWN ADVANTAGE. EVER BEEN ON THAT ONE? THE ONE IN SEATTLE IS VERY COOL. KIRK: I HAVE NOT. HOW ABOUT THAT? I DON'T MIX WELL WITH THE DEW POINT OVER 75. AL: IT'S WAY OVER 75. KIRK: IT'S JUST BEEN ONE OF THOSE NIGHTS FOR TUA IN THIS OFFENSE, -- TAKING AWAY HIS MAIN THREATS. HE IS TRYING TO FIND OTHER OPTIONS. DUBOSE NOT GETTING HIS HEAD TURNED AROUND, TIPPED BALL INTERCEPTION, NOT ON THE SAME BALL GOES OVER HIS HEAD, INTERCEPTION AND A COUPLE OF BACKUP OFFENSIVE LINEMAN IN THE GAME WITH KENDALL LAMM. YOU SEE LESTER COTTON AND HE LOOKS TO DARA BUBBLE AND SAYS, MAN, SHOULD HAVE THROWN IT AWAY. THERE IS TYREEK HILL SAYING, LET'S GO. LET'S GET THIS THING GOING. AL: HE WAS SHAKING HIS HEAD COMING OFF THE FIELD. HE CANNOT GET LOOSE. THEY HAVE TAKEN CARE OF HIM TUA'S ONLY THRONE FOR 109 YARDS -- THROWN FOR 109 YARDS. PASS CAUGHT BY HILL. HE GETS EIGHT. KAYLLE, WHAT YOU GOT? KAYLEE: THE DOLPHINS HAVE THEIR LEFT TACKLE BACK ON THE FIELD. HE CAME OUT BECAUSE OF THE LAST INTERCEPTION BECAUSE OF A SHOULDER ISSUE. HE IS GETTING HIS HARNESS READJUSTED. YOU CAN SEE IT. HE AND TUA HAD A CHAT BEFORE THEY HEADED BACK OUT THERE AL: THEY HAD LAMM IN AT THAT PO INT, THEY HAD ALREADY MADE THE CHANGE IT LEFT GUARD, 2ND AND 2, AND THE BILLS EXPLOITED IT. TO THE OUTSIDE. STUFFED. RIGHT AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. PUTS THE WRAP ON JAYLEN WRIGHT. MCDERMOTT, WE CAN TALK SCHEMES AND XES AND OES ALL YOU WANT, THINGS OF THE VIEWERS AT HOME OR SING, YOU'RE SEEING A DEFENSE, THE BIG EMPHASIS AGAINST ALL OF THIS SPEED WAS KEEP THE BALL IN FRONT AND FLY TO THE FOOTBALL. PLAY SMART, PLAY FAST, PLAY PHYSICAL AND WE NEED TURNOVERS. THOSE WERE THE POINTS HE BROUGHT UP TO US THIS WEEK. EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE SEEN FROM BUFFALO'S DEFENSE. AL: 3RD AND 4. 8:00 TO GO IN THE THIRD QUARTER. PRESSURE. MILLER ALMOST GOT THERE BUT HE COMPLETES THE PASS. BIG GAIN INSIDE BILLS TERRITORY COULD 43 YARD LINE. HIS BEST GAIN OF THE NIGHT. FIRST DOWN, THE GAIN OF 21. KIRK: AND MILLER ALMOST COMES UP WITH ANOTHER SACK. HE HAD HIS FIRST SACK LAST WEEK. LOOK AT THAT SPOON MOVE -- THAT SPIN MOVE. LET'S GIVE TUA A LOT OF CREDIT. HE COULD NOT STEP INTO THIS THROW. FINALLY SEE THAT GLANCE ROUTE THAT WE ALWAYS THINK ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO MIAMI'S OFFENSE. THEY STILL HIT TOO HIGH, BUT IS ABLE TO GET BETWEEN THE CORNER AND THE LINEBACKER AND THE SAFETY CLOSING IN. AL: FIRST DOWN AT THE 43. TUA OPEN, LEFT IN BOUNDS IS THE QUESTION. HILL IS THERE. IT IS NOT, SO HE'LL WAS ABLE TO TRUCK. KI-- THE CHALK. KIRK: THE LEFT FOOT LOOKED LIKE IT MIGHT'VE GOTTEN DOWN. I DO NOT THINK THE RIGHT FOOT WAS CLOSE AT ALL. THAT LEFT FOOT. LET'S SEE. WELL, THE LEFT FOOT ACTUALLY TOUCHES THE LINE. AL: MM-HMM, YEP. KIRK: BUT YOU LIKE THE ANSWER IF YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY THAT TOO HIGH LOOK, TRY TO SQUEEZE THE BALL ON THE SIDELINES BETWEEN THE CORNER AND THE SAFETY. AL: TO THE OUTSIDE. WITH SOME BLOCKING IN FRONT. NICE RUN. GOOD RUN. JAYLEN WRIGHT. ROOKIE FOURTH ROUND PICK OUT OF TENNESSEE. 3RD AND SHORT. KIRK: HOW ABOUT TYREEK HILL THIS TIME ON THE VETERAN VON MILLER TRYING TO HELP OUT, TO SET THE EDGE HERE AND WILLING TO COME DOWN AND TAKE ON THE BIG FELLA? NICE JOB, HELP THEM GET TO THE EDGE. I LIKE YOUR TONE. HEY, THAT IS A GOOD RUN. I THINK JAYLEN WRIGHT BRINGS SOME NATURAL ABILITY TO RUN THE FOOTBALL AND HAS NOT JUST QUICKNESS BUT SOME POWER. AL: HILL IN MOTION OUT OF THE BACKFIELD, FIRST DOWN. TO THE 20 YARD LINE. BEFORE HE IS TACKLE. CONVERTING ON A 3RD AND SHORT. KIRK: HE GETS A GOOD PUSH. 73 AUSTIN JACKSON DOES A GOOD JOB AND EVERYONE IS PINCHING AS AN OFFENSIVE LINE DOWN THE LOOK AT THAT QUICK CHANGE OF DIRECTION BY ACHANE. WE TALKED ABOUT JAYLEN WRIGHT HAVING SOME PHYSICALITY. YOU CAN SEE THAT ALSO, THE VERSATILITY OF ACHANE, A 4-3-2 GUY BUT RUNNING THROUGH SOME OF THOSE ARM TACKLES. AL: MEANWHILE ARMISTEAD IS BACK ON THE BENCH. HE WAS OUT, AND LAMM IS IN TO THE END ZONE. A LITTLE TOO HIGH AND OFF THE FINGERTIPS AND HAMLIN WAS THERE BUT A HIT THE GROUND, INTENDED FOR JULIAN HILL. FIRST TIME THEY HAVE GONE AFTER HIM. HE WOULD BE THE NUMBER THREE TGITH TG-- TIGHT END. KIRK: THEY ATTACKED THE SIDELINE FOR, IF THEY PLAY TOO HIGH, WHAT IS THE OTHER ANSWER? DOWN THE MIDDLE,BALL GETS UP A LITTLE BIT AWAY FROM HIM. USUALLY IF SMITH WERE IN THERE, YOU WOULD EXPECT THEM TO HIT THAT SAME ROUTE. HILL WAS A HIGH SPOKE QUARTERBACK, PLAYED SLOT IN COLLEGE. THAT TIME NOT ABLE TO BRING IT AL: INSIDE 6:00 IN THE THIRD. TUA QUICK THROW, FIGHTING HIS WAY TO THE 12 YARD LINE IS SMITH. SENDING UP ANOTHER BIG THIRD DOWN HERE. 2-2 ON THIRD DOWN AND STARTED BACK AT THE 30 YARD LINE. KIRK: YOU LOOK AT THE CLOCK, YOU LOOK AT THE SCORE, I THINK MIKE MCDANIEL KNOWS THEY NEED A WE TALKED ABOUT THE GAME WILL COME DOWN FOR MIAMI, THEY MOVE THE BALL. WHAT WILL THEY DO IN THE RED ZONE? WILL THERE BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH TOUCHDOWNS OR NOT? 1-2 SO FAR TONIGHT IN THIS AREA. THEY NEED A TOUCHDOWN ON THIS DRIVE. AL: THEY WERE GREAT LAST YEAR, SECOND IN THE LEAGUE AND THE RED ZONE, THIRD DOWN, 3. THEY PLAY HERE FOR THEM. AND HE'S STUFFED. ACHANE -- ED OLIVER IS THERE. HAD THAT BIG BREAKUP ON FOURTH DOWN THE FIRST HALF. IT'S FOURTH AND 4 NOW. KIRK: REMEMBER THE LEFT SIDE WITH LESTER COTTON AND KENDALL LAMM, THESE ARE NEW GUYS. WE'VE SEEN ED OLIVER DOING IT TO THE STARTERS AND NOW YOU SEE HIM DOING IT TO THE BACKUPS. HE IS THE ENFORCER IN THE INTERIOR WITH THE LOW, THAT LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY, 6' CENTER OF GRAVITY, 6'1", 290, GREAT QUICKNESS. AL: GOT 20 MINUTES LEFT IN REGULATION. DOWN BY 21 POINT, FOURTH AND 4. TUA STEPS UP, HE IS GOING TO RUN FOR THE FIRST DOWN. AND TAKES A SHOT AT THE SIX YARD HAMLIN HIT HIM. AND TUA DOWN. MMM. PICKED UP THE FIRST, SPLIT THE SCENE BUT PAYS THE PRICE. THE BACKUP QUARTERBACK IS SKYLER THOMPSON. MEANWHILE, THEY LOOK AT TUA. DOLPHINS TAKING A KNEE AT THE MOMENT, BACK AT THE 15 YARD LINE AS THEY ATTEND TO HIM. HERE IT IS AGAIN. TAGOVAILOA IS UP AFTER TAKING THAT HIT. ASSISTED OFF THE FIELD WITH A SLIGHT LIMPED. -- A SLIGHT LIMP. KIRK: OF COURSE WE ALL REMEMBER A FEW YEARS AGO THAT WAS A BIG CONCERN IN HIS CAREER. A FEW YEARS AGO, HE BULKED UP TO TRY TO PROTECT HIMSELF. THIS YEAR HE'S ACTUALLY DOWN 14 POUNDS, MUCH SLIMMER TO TRY TO BE ABLE TO MOVE AROUND. AL: YOU WATCHED HIM FOR YEARS, COLLEGE AND PRO AND SOMETIMES HE CAN RUN RECKLESSLY. KIRK: I FEEL LIKE HE' KIRK: I FEEL LIKE HE'S A LITTLE RECKLESS WHEN HE RUNS AND HE DOES NOT DO IT OFTEN. BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SLIDE. YOU WOULD LOVE TO SEE HIM, ESPECIALLY WITH THE SAFETY COMING TOWARDS HIM, HE ALREADY HAD THE FIRST DOWN, JUST LIKE, FEET FIRST, GET DOWN AND PROTECT YOUR BODY. ON ONE HAND, YOU ADMIRE HIM, HIS DETERMINATION. ON THE OTHER HAND, HE'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT THIS TEAM IS ABOUT AND WHO THEY ARE. YOU LOVE TO HAVE SEEN THAT SLIDE TO GET DOWN. UP TO SEE HIM WALKING OFF THE AL: RIGHT BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM. THAT WAS A FOURTH DOWN PLAY, SO HE KEEPS THE DRIVE ALIVE. SKYLAR THOMPSON WHO ACTUALLY PLAYED IN A PLAYOFF GAME BETWEEN THESE TWO TEAMS AND DIDN'T PLAY, I MEAN, HE WAS OK AND THAT GAME EVEN THOUGH THEY LOST. SEVENTH ROUND PICK. HE PLAYED IN THE WILD CARD GAME TWO YEARS AGO AGAINST THE BILLS. KIRK: CAN RUN THE BALL. AL: YES, HE CAN. THIS TIME HE GIVES IT TO ACHANE HE ACTUALLY STARTED TO STUMBLE. >> LET'S PUT THIS INTO CONTEXT. TUA DID NOT MISS A START LAST YEAR BUT DURING THE 2022 SEASON HE EXPERIENCED TWO CONCUSSIONS. HE WAS EVALUATED FOR A HEAD INJURY WE THREE BECAUSE THE BILLS BUT RETURNED TO THE GAME IN ONE GAME LATER HE EXHIBITED TEXTBOOK CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS AND WAS TAKEN OFF THE FIELD BY AN AMBULANCE PARE THE CONTROVERSY PROMPTED THE NFL TO CHANGES CONCUSSION POLICY AND IN WEEK 16 THAT 20 SEASON. AL: WE REMEMBER THAT ONE WELL. STUFFED AGAIN. NOTHING HAPPENING THERE. ACHANE HIT AS HE TRIES TO CROSS LOVE LINE, -- THE LINE KIRK: WE ARE ALL THINKING ABOUT TUA AND HOPE FOR THE BEST THERE WERE ESPECIALLY WITH THE HISTORY THAT HE HAD THAT KAYLEE JUST TALKED ABOUT BUT WITH SKYLAR THOMPSON AND MIKE MCDANIEL NOW, THEY NEED A TOUCHDOWN THIS 3:00 MINUTES TO GO IN THE THIRD VERY DIFFERENT NOW. BUFFALO DOES NOT FEAR, UNTIL THOMPSON MAKES THEM PAY FOR IT. THEY ARE NOT FEARING THE THREAT OF THE THROW. SEE IF HE CAN GET THE BALL TO AL: THOMPSON WITH THE SEVENTH ROUND PIC TWO YEARS AGO. HANGS IN THE POCKET. FLOATS ONE INTO THE END ZONE. NOT EVEN CLOSE. BERRIOS WAS CLOSEST. 4TH AND GOAL. KIRK: BERRIOS LOST HIS FITTING, MIDFIELD. WE DID HAVE SOME RAIN EARLY THIS AFTERNOON. I DO NOT KNOW HOW SLICK THAT FIELD IS BUT HE LOST HIS FOOTING AND THAT BALL NEVER HAD A CHANCE BUT THIS IS FOUR DOWN TERRITORY, 2:43 IN THE THIRD, THEY NEED A TOUCHDOWN HERE. AL: THOMPSON STARTED THAT GAME IN THE PLAYOFFS TWO YEARS AGO BECAUSE TUA WAS HURT AND TEDDY BRIDGEWATER WAS ALSO HER. THREE RECEIVER SET TO THE LEFT AND ALL KINDS OF MOVEMENT UP FRONT. >> SECOND CHARGE, TIMEOUT MIAMI. AL: MIAMI HAD TO TAKE AN EARLY NOW THEY ARE DOWN TO JUST ONE. 2:39 REMAINING IN THE THIRD. KIRK: AND SKYLAR THOMPSON IN HIS THIRD YEAR OUT OF KANSAS STATE, YOU CAN SEE THE EXPERIENCE HE HAD GOING BACK TO THE TWO YEARS AGO, WHEN HE WAS IN THE WILD CARD GAME BECAUSE OF THE INJURY TO TUA. SO, HE DOES HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE IN SOME BIG GAMES. LIKE I SAID, HE CAN CREATE IF HE GETS PRESCIENT, HE'S THE ATHLETIC ABILITY TO PULL AWAY FROM PRESSURE. THE QUESTION IS, CAN THEY GET SEPARATION? THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE KNOWN FOR, IS THEIR ABILITY TO SEPARATE FROM TIGHT COVERAGE WHETHER IT IS WADDLED OR TYREEK HILL. BILLS TRYING TO TAKE THOSE AWAY. MAKES YOU WONDER IF SMITH, THE T IGHT END THAT CAME OVER THIS YEAR, IF THEY CAN GET HIM IT WITH HIS SIZE, 6'3", 250, TRY TO GIVE HIM THE FOOTBALL. AL: MIAMI PLAYING WITH THE NEW QUARTERBACK AND A NEW LEFT TACKLE AND A NEW LEFT GUARD. YOU THINK YOU GOT PROBLEMS? SO DO WE. THOMPSON, HE SLIPS AND DOWN HE GOES. 15 YARD LINE AND VON MILLER, AFTER THAT 14 GAME DROUGHT IN HIS 14TH YEAR, AT THE AGE OF 35, NOW HAS SACKS IN BACK TO BACK GAMES WITH 2:40 TO GO IN THE THIRD. 31-10, BILLS. LOOK NOW AT TONIGHT'S JOURNEY AS PRESENTED BY CONDE. FIRST HALF, 82 TOTAL YARDS, TWO TOUCHDOWNS, ONE ON THE GROUND AND ONE IN THE AIR. BILLS DEFENSE, 17 POINTS OFF THREE TURNOVERS AND ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT THERE GOES TUA BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM OFF THE LAST SERIES. THEY TURNED IT OVER ON DOWNS. A LONG NIGHT FOR MIKE MCDANIEL AT THIS POINT DOWN BY 21. IN THE BILLS HAVE THE BALL. -- AND THE BILLS HAVE THE BALL FROM THE 15 YARD LINE. THEY ARE STARTING TO USE SOME OF THE CLOCK. THE GOOD RUN GAME CONTINUES. KIRK: LET'S GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE SACK. VON MILLER SAID NOW I GO WITH GET OFF. I DON'T WANT TO WRESTLE AT 35 YEARS OLD WITH THESE BIG GUYS BUT THAT TIME IT WAS JUST SPEED AROUND THE EDGE OF THE RIGHT TACKLE, AUSTIN JACKSON, ON THE FOURTH DOWN PLAY. GREAT TO SEE HIM WITHOUT MOTOR AND INTENSITY. ONE OF THE GREAT GUYS IN THE LEAGUE FOR A LONG TIME. AL: WON THE SUPER BOWL M.V.P. AWARD WITH DENVER AND WON ANOTHER RING WITH THE RAMS TWO CONCLUDING HIS CAREER POSSIBLY AT BUFFALO. WE SPOKE WITH MILLER YESTERDAY. LOOKING UP SOME OF THE THINGS ABOUT HIS LIFE AND I SAID, WAIT A MINUTE, YOU MAJORED IN POULTRY SCIENCE AT TEXAS A&M. WHAT GOT YOU INTO POULTRY SCIENCE? HE SAID, I NEEDED TO GET MY GPA UP AND I LOOKED AT THAT CLASS AND THE AVERAGE GRADE WAS A MINUS. AND HE GOT TO LIKE IT A LOT. KIRK: YOU SURE DID. I THINK IT HAS BECOME A THING FOR HIM TO THIS DAY. HE LOVES IT. BREAKING DOWN DIFFERENT CHICKEN AL: KENTUCKY FRIED, POPEYES, CHIK-FILA. A GAIN OF ONE. KAYLEE: THE DOLPHINS TELL US TUA TAGOVAILOA WILL NOT RETURN TO THE GAME. HE HAS BEEN RULED OUT WITH A CONCUSSION. THEY DETERMINED THAT SIX MINUTES AFTER HE LEFT THE FIELD AND WENT TO THE LOCKER ROOM. AL: A LITTLE IRONY THERE THAT HE WAS HIT BY DAMAR HAMLIN, AND YOU KNOW THAT HISTORY. IT WAS LEGAL. IT WAS UNFORTUNATE. THE ONLY GOOD THING FOR THE DOLPHINS IS YOU GET A MINUTE BY WEEK SO THEY DON'T HAVE A NAME FOR 10 DAYS. GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO PASS THE PROTOCOL. SECOND DOWN AND 9. BREAKING A TACKLE, FIGHTING HIS WAY AND GETTING THE YARDAGE IS DALTON KINCAID. THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER. KIRK: I THINK WE ARE GETTING A REAL FEEL FOR WHO BUFFALO WILL BE THIS YEAR. PLAYING WITH GREAT INTENSITY ON JOSH ALLEN IS NOT FORCING THE BALL. DIGGS IS 12 OF 17. THEY ARE I'M GOING TO COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA. AL: NEITHER IS THE OWNER OF THE TEAM AND THE GENERAL MANAGER. MEANWHILE, NICE LITTLE RUN FOR THE PEGULA FAMILY. THERE IS TERRY. HIS DAUGHTER WAS SENSATIONAL IN THE U.S. OPEN GETTING TO THE FINAL. A TREMENDOUS RUN FOR HER, JESSICA. PRETTY GOOD. HE HAS THE BILLS ON THEIR WAY TO BEING 2-0. TO HIS DAUGHTER GOES TO THE FINALS OF THE U.S. OPEN. AND HE HAS THE NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE. KIRK: A PRETTY GOOD RUN HE HE HAS TO BE PLEASED. THERE WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS FOOTBALL TEAM WITH FACES. HERE THEY ARE UP 21 ON THE ROAD IN WEEK NUMBER TWO AGAINST A DIVISIONAL OPPONENT. AL: SAM MARTIN SENDS IT SKYWARD. THEY LET IT BOUNCE. IT GOES INTO THE END ZONE. EARLY FOURTH QUARTER. BACK IN 30 SECONDS. AL: THE DOLPHINS HAVE IT DOWN ALREADY 1-10. SKYLAR THOMPSON IN FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT. HE WAS INACTIVE IN EVERY GAME LAST SEASON. HE PLAYED IN THE WILDCARD GAME IN 2022 AND HASN'T PLAYED SINCE. HE GOT SACKED ON THE FOURTH DOWN PLAY THE LAST TIME THEY HAD THE HE STARTS FROM THE 20 YARD LINE. DOWN FIELD. OFF TO THE SIDE. A MINIMUM GAIN. KIRK: THEY CALLED THAT PLAY EARLIER IN THE RED ZONE AND SCORED A TOUCHDOWN BUT THIS TIME BUFFALO IS IN A BETTER POSITION TO DEFEND THAT. REMEMBER, MY REMEMBER, MIAMI IS NOT ONLY PLAYING WITH A BACKUP QUARTERBACK BUT ALSO A BACKUP GUARD AND TACKLE. DOWN BY 20 ONE IN OBVIOUS PASSING SITUATIONS. AL: HE HAS NOT PLAYED SINCE 2022 AT THE HELM. CAUGHT. A BUSY NIGHT FOR ETIENNE. HE HAS CARRIED THE BALL 21 TIMES AND CAUGHT FIVE. JOSH ALLEN CAN SMILE. A GOOD ENOUGH NIGHT FOR HIM. THE NUMBERS WON'T LINE HIM UP BUT THE DEFENSE HAS BEEN SENSATIONAL. AL: ABOUT TWO AL: ABOUT TTO GO 12-1 AGAINST THIS TEAM AND HIS CAREER. JOSH IN HIS SEVENTH YEAR AND SHOULD BE IN THE PRIME OF HIS CAREER. THOMPSON, HANGS IN THE POCKET. THROWS. GOOD COVERAGE. ALAN, -- ALLEN WE TALKED TO HIM LAST NIGHT. HE GREW UP IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA IN A TOWN WITH A THOUSAND PEOPLE AND KNOWN AS THE CANTALOUPE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. HE HAS NEVER BEEN THE GRAND MARSHALL. KIRK: WE WERE ASKING HIM ABOUT GETTING UP AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING AS THE SON OF A FARMER. HIS DAD SAID THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE NOT GETTING UP EARLY TO HELP ME OUT IS IF YOU ARE PLAYING SPORTS. SO HE SAID, ME AND MY BROTHER PLAYED EVERY SPORT WE COULD FIND. AL: CAUGHT AT THE 40. KIRK: HE SAID HE HAS GRADUATED FROM CONTRIBUTING AND HELPING OUT. AL: HE OWNS THE FARM. THIRD AND 4. THAT WAS TOO HIGH AND INCOMPLETE GOOD WHAT CAN I TELL YOU -- IF WE ARE SHOWING THE FARM, YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS. 31-10 BALLGAME. KIRK: LET'S GO BACK TO VON HIS PRESENCE THERE -- SOMETIMES IT IS NOT ABOUT THE STOCK BUT MAY MAKING THE QUARTERBACK FEEL YOU. HE SAW HIM GET OFF QUICKLY AND HE HAD TO GET THE BALL OFF HURRY. I THINK HE AFFECTED THE QUARTERBACK AND THE ACCURACY OF THE THROW. AL: FOURTH AND 4. THEY HAVE TO GO FOR IT AND WE HAVE A WHISTLE HERE. AL: EI ESPECIALLY IN MIAMI. AL: FOURTH AND 9 BUT THEY WILL STILL GO FOR IT. A DEEP, DEEP DROP. EVERYBODY COVERED. RUNNING AROUND. GOING FOR THE FIRST DOWN BUT WILL NOT GET THERE. AND HE IS TACKLED BY ROUSSEAU WHO COMES OFF A THREE SACK GAME LAST WEEK. KIRK: NOT ONLY ARE THEY KEEPING THE SAFETIES BACK, THEY ARE PLAYING MAN COVERAGE UNDERNEATH THAT ALLOWING THEM TO DISRUPT THE TIMING. IT HAS BEEN A GREAT NIGHT FOR BUFFALO IN EVERY PHASE OF THE GAME HERE IN MIAMI, WEEK POWERED JAMES COOK HAS DONE WHAT HE HAS NEEDED AVERAGING SEVEN YARDS PER CARRY. YOU CAN SEE 39 YARDS FROM WHAT THEY EXPECTED OF HIM. TACKLES AND HIS ABILITY TO SHAKE THESE MIAMI DEFENDERS. A HOMECOMING OF SORTS COOK. HE GREW UP IN THIS AREA. HE WENT TO GEORGIA FOR COLLEGE. HIS OLDER BROTHER AND MOM ARE WATCHING SO A BIG NIGHT FOR JAMES COOK AND HIS BILLS TEAM. AL: THEY BUILT THE BIG LEAD THE THIRD TIME BUFFALO HAS STARTED A DRIVE AFTER STOPPING MIAMI ON AND TRYING TO USE THE CLOCK HERE MOVING FORWARD, A GAIN OF ABOUT 4 YARDS. KAYLEE: AFTER SEEING A DOLPHIN LEFT TACKLE IN AND OUT OF THE GAME, HE IS NOW IN THE DOLPHINS LOCKER ROOM HEADING INTO THE X-RAY ROOM. BEFORE HE DID HE GAVE TUA TAGOVAILOA'S BROTHER A HUG AS HE SITS OUTSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM WAITING FOR THE QUARTERBACK TO EMERGE. EVERYTHING IS GOING WRONG FOR MIAMI ON A NIGHT WHERE THEY WERE FAVORED BY A COUPLE OF POINTS. BUT IT HAS BEEN ALL BUFFALO. AND IT ALL HAS TO DO WITH THE DEFENSE, CLEARLY. A 32ND TIMEOUT. KIRK: THE BILLS HAVE HAD THEIR WAY AND HAVE NOT HAD TO RELY ON THIS NEW ROOM OF WIDE RECEIVERS WITH DAVIS NO LONGER HERE AND STEFON DIGGS NO LONGER HERE. AT SOME POINT THEY ARE GOING TO GO INTO A GAME AND JOSH ALLEN IS GOING TO HAVE TO RELY ON THIS GROUP. YOU SEE SHAKIRA WITH 39 RECEPTIONS BUT EVERYONE ELSE IS GONE. IT IS A NEW GROUP. SHAKIR COMES BACK. MACK HOLLINS SETTING THE TONE IN THE ROOM. CURTIS SAMUEL CAN DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. MARQUEZ VALDES-SCANTLING HAS PLAYED SO MANY BIG GAMES. KIND OF EXCITED TO SEE WHAT THEY CAN BECOME ALONG WITH THE TWO TIGHT ENDS. AL: THEY HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO SHOW THEIR STUFF YET. THEY PICKED COLEMAN IN THE SECOND ROUND. THEY TRADE IT DOWN WITH KANSAS CITY TO LET KANSAS CITY PICK IN FRONT OF THEM. A LOT OF GOOD RECEIVERS AND KANSAS CITY WENT FOR ONE OF THEM AS ONE. A PRETTY GOOD OPENING NIGHT FOR THEM AS WELL. KIRK: I THOUGHT MIAMI OF ALL TEAMS WHEN YOU GO BACK TO THAT DRAFT -- WOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN INTERESTING IF XANDER WERE ORTHY HAD GONE. AL: THEY WENT FOR THE BIG 6'4" ROOKIE OUT OF FLORIDA STATE. SHAKIR, THE ONLY GUY WHO CAUGHT A PASS FROM ALLEN COMING INTO THE SEASON AS WE TICK DOWN TO 10 MINUTES. KIRK: THEY BROUGHT IN BROOKS AND DAVID LONG. THE FIRST TIME JOSH ALLEN HAS FELT ANY PRESSURE. HE DID A GOOD SENSE OF -- HE HAD THE GOOD SENSE TO FALL BACK AND FIND THE OPEN RECEIVER. THESE GUYS ARE PIECES THAT FIT TOGETHER LIKE A JIGSAW PUZZLE. I THINK SHAKIR WILL HAVE A YEAR WITH JOSH ALLEN THIS YEAR. AL: RAY DAVIS. YOU THINK ABOUT THE MOVE THEY MADE IN THE OFF-SEASON. IT IS NOT OFTEN YOU TRADE AWAY SOMEONE OF HIS CALIBER. YOU LOOK AT THAT PERIOD, MOST COMPLETIONS IN THE LEAGUE, MOST RECEIVING YARDS AND TIED FOR THE MOST TOUCHDOWNS. THEY SENT HIM TO HOUSTON. AND DAVIS, AS YOU SEE THE GM, THE ARCHITECT OF THE DEALS, DAVIS LEAVES TOWN AND THE FANS ARE THINKING -- WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE? KIRK: LOOK AT WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IN THE PLAYOFFS, THEY NEEDED TO SHAKE THINGS UP. I THINK THE IDEA AROUND THIS IS WHEN YOU LET GO OF A SUPERSTAR LIKE THAT, THERE IS A TENDENCY TO ALWAYS FIND WAYS TO GIVE THAT SUPERSTAR THE BALL. WHEN YOU LOSE THAT ELEMENT, NOW YOU HAVE JOE BRADY AS THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR WHO CAN SAY, WE ARE NOT GOING TO RELY ON ONE GUY. WE ARE GOING TO READ THE COVERAGE AND LET THE DEFENSE DICTATE WHERE THE BALL GOES. ONE GAME YOU MIGHT HAVE ONE CATCH AND ANOTHER GAME YOU HAVE 10. IT IS HOW THE DEFENSE PLAYS WILL DICTATE THE READ FOR JOSH ALLEN. AND THEN THEY BECOME MORE RELIANT ON THE TIGHT ENDS. AL: TALKING TO 10 DIFFERENT GUYS, IT REMINDS ME AS WE HAVE A TIMEOUT CALLED BY BUFFALO BEFORE THE DELAY. YOU TRADE AWAY A MEGASTAR. IT IS WHAT KANSAS CITY DID WHEN THEY GOT RID OF TYREEK HILL. YOU HAVE MAHOMES COMING INTO HIS PRIME. YOU HAVE THE FASTEST GUY IN THE IT WORKED OUT PRETTY WELL FOR KANSAS CITY. KIRK: AND I THINK IT FREES UP THIS OFFENSE. STEFON DIGGS IS A GENERATIONAL TALENT, A SUPERSTAR AND I'M SURE HE WILL DO GREAT THINGS IN HOUSTON BUT IT IS ABOUT TRYING TO SEE WHERE THEY WILL GO AS A I THINK THE POTENTIAL -- I THINK YOU WILL SEE THEM RELY MORE ON THE RUNNING GAME. HOW ABOUT THE JOB BY THE OFFENSIVE LINE ON THE ROAD. THEY TOOK PRESSURE OFF JOSH ALLEN AND THE RECEIVERS. THEY WON THE TURNOVER GAME. I THINK IT IS A SEAN MCDERMOTT KIND OF TEAM. JOSH ALLEN NOT FEELING LIKE HE HAS TO BE THE HERO. THERE WILL BE THOSE MOMENTS BUT NOT EVERY WEEK. AL: THIRD AND 11. ALLEN IS ABLE TO THROW. THE PASS INTENDED FOR COLEMAN. THE ROOKIE NUMBER ONE PICK -- THAT IS FOURTH AND 11. KIRK: JOSH ALLEN IS FORTUNATE HE ALWAYS SEEMS TO RUN TO HIS RIGHT AND GETS RID OF THE BALL RIGHT BEFORE HE GETS TO THE SIDELINE. UP AND OVER. THE ATHLETIC ABILITY TO GET UP AND OVER THE BENCH. THE BIG FELLA CAN CLIMB THE LADDER. AL: TYLER BASS -- NO GOOD. THE NEXGEN STATS POWERED BY AWS. FOUR PRESSURES, 2.1 AVERAGE TIME TO PRESSURE, FASTEST GOING BACK TO 2021 BEFORE THE ACL. HE TRIED TO PLAY LAST YEAR. NOT THE SAME SINCE THAT INJURY BUT NOW HE LOOKS LIKE HIS OLD SELF. REFEREE: FALSE START. KIRK: THIS IS GOING TO BE A GAME ON SO MANY LEVELS THAT MIAMI IS GOING TO WANT TO PUT BEHIND THEM AND MOVE ON. OBVIOUSLY, WE THINK ABOUT TUA AND HIS HEALTH AND WHERE THEY WILL GO FROM HERE. FARMSTEAD IS OUTCOME OF THE LEFT TACKLE, WITH AN INJURY. YOU HAVE A BACKUP LEFT TACKLE, BACKUP QUARTERBACK. AL: AND EIGHT PENALTIES AGAINST THE DOLPHINS TONIGHT AND ONLY ONE AGAINST BUFFALO. KIRK: THE STORY TONIGHT BESIDES THE INJURIES IS OTHER TEAMS IN THE DIVISION ARE SEEING WHAT JACKSONVILLE DID LAST WEEK, THEY ARE SEEING WHAT BUFFALO DID TONIGHT AND THEY ARE SAYING, OK, HERE IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO WHEN WE GO AGAINST THIS MIAMI WE ARE GOING TO KEEP EVERYBODY IN FRONT. WE ARE GOING TO PLAY MAN UNDER WITH TWO SAFETIES DEEP. MAKE THEM FIND SOMEBODY ELSE OTHER THAN HILL AND W MAKE THEM RUN THE FOOTBALL. AL: TOOS TO THE OUT -- TOSS TO THE OUTSIDE AND OUT OF GOES JAYLEN WRIGHT. LET'S LOOK AT THE MIAMI SCHEDULE. TUA IN THE CONCUSSION PROTOCOL. THEY HAVE 10 DAYS. THEY GO FROM MIAMI TO SEATTLE. THEY COME BACK AND PLAY TENNESSEE HERE AND THEN AT NEW ENGLAND. LOOKING AT THE TWO BEST TEAMS IN THE DIVISION COMING INTO THE THEY HAVE THE JETS AND NEW ENGLAND -- WHO KNOWS. A BYE WEEK COMES IN WEEK SIX. THOMPSON HAS TO START AND IF TUA CANNOT COME BACK, TIM BOYLE WHO WE SAW LAST YEAR WITH THE JETS IS ON THE PRACTICE SQUAD SO HE WOULD BE THE BACKUP. UNLESS MARINO COMES OUT OF RETIREMENT. AL: 40 YARD LINE. STAYING AT HIS FEET. NICE NUMBERS TONIGHT. HE HAS 53 YARDS, AND THAT IS A 16 YARD GAME TO GO W THE GROUND. KIRK: I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS A BIGGER DEAL THAN IT IS. IT IS 31-10. THE OFFENSES IS ON THE FIELD. -- THE OFFENSE IS ON THE FIELD. THERE ARE 15 MORE GAMES TO GO. YOU WOULD LOVE TO SEE THEM UP WATCHING AND INVOLVED. TONIGHT IS NOT JUST ABOUT X'S AND O'S. BUFFALO SHOWED UP AND PLAYED AS A TEAM. THEY SHOWED THE LEAGUE THAT WITHOUT STEPHAN DIGGS THIS WILL BE THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD. THEY HAVE JOSH ALLEN AND A BUNCH OF GUYS AND THEY TOLD THE FIELD. THEY LOST ONE OF THEIR STARTERS TO AN INJURY AND ALREADY DID NOT HAVE JOHNSON. AND THEY PLAYED WITH A MASSIVE CHIP ON THEIR SHOULDER AS A GROUP AND THEN YOU SEE TYREEK HILL AND WADDLE TO GO WITH FIVE MINUTES LEFT IN THE GAME AND IT IS A DIFFERENT VIBE FROM WHAT YOU SEE ON THE OTHER SIDELINE. AL: IT IS ALSO THE LOOK OF A TEAM DOWN BY 21 POINTS AND CAN'T DO ANYTHING AND HAS A QUARTERBACK IN CONCUSSION THROWING OFF HIS BACK FOOT. HIS BIG NIGHT CONTINUES AT LEAST ON THE STAT SHEET FOR HIM AND THAT IS A FIRST DOWN. A STATEMENT GAME IS USED TO TO MUCH. BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, BUFFALO IS MAKING AN EARLY STATEMENT -- AN EARLY SEASON STATEMENT WITH A BOWL HORN KIRK: JOSH ALLEN HAS DOMINATED MIAMI BUT IT IS EARLY SEPTEMBER AND IT IS HOT. CAN BUFFALO COME DOWN HERE AND WIN THIS GAME? FROM THE WORD "GO" THEY BEAT THEM AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. WE DON'T TALK A LOT ABOUT THE OFFENSE, IT WAS REALLY ABOUT THE DEFENSE, THERE TURNOVERS AND GOING BACK TO THAT COLLECTIVE ATTITUDE THAT THEY PLAY WITH. AL:NS PLAYED IN THE OLD ORANGE BOWL AND MOVED IN HERE IN 1987. THIS IS WHERE THE MARLINS. THE EXPANSION FRANCHISE BEFORE THEY BUILT THEIR OWN STADIUM. THEY DID WIN A WORLD SERIES IN THIS BALLPARK. KIRK: WHO IS THE SECOND BASEMAN? CRAIG COUNSEL. AL: NOW A MANAGER WITH THE CUBS. NO. WHO DOES HE MANAGE? KIRK: BREWERS? AL: WE ARE AT THAT POINT, SORRY FOLKS. GEORGE HILL. KIRK: AFTER THE HIP SURGERY, LOOKING GREAT. DARREN IS BACK, TONY IS BACK. AL: 3:00 LEFT IN THE FOURTH. YOU HAVE FOUR RECEIVERS BUNCHED TO THE RIGHT SIDE, TOP SIMMER FIRE TO THE END ZONE, ALMOST, JULIAN HILL TRIED TO MAKE THE KIRK: A GOOD THROW BY THOMPSON IN BETWEEN THREE DEFENDERS. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT SEEM ROUND, I THINK OF JONNU SMITH, BUT THE SECOND TIME THEY HAVE TRIED TO GET THE BALL TO JULIAN HE ALMOST CAME DOWN WITH THAT ONE. HE GAVE THEM A CHANCE. THE SPLIT SAFETIES IS WHERE YOU ATTACK. HE CAME CLOSE TO GETTING THAT AL: SECOND AND 10. IT IS CAUGHT AT THE 15. ONE WAY TO KEEP AN AUDIENCE IN A BLOWOUT GAME LIKE THIS, THERE IS SOMETHING IN PLAY. KIRK: ONE THING IS NOT. AL: HOWEVER, AT 41 POINTS, A FEW HEARTS WERE BEATING RAPIDLY WHEN THAT PASS WAS DROPPED IN THE END THIRD AND 2. THOMPSON FIRES, BROKEN UP AT THE GOAL LINE. KIRK: THESE CORNERS HAVE PLAYED GREAT FOOTBALL TONIGHT. BENFORD IS 6' BENFORD IS 6'1", OUT OF VILLANOVA. BENFORD LAST YEAR BECAME THE GUY AND CONTINUES THIS YEAR. I'LL GIVE ASIDE, DOUGLAS, BOTH GUYS HAVE PLAYED WELL. THOMPSON PRESSURED, THROWS, INTENDED FOR ROBBIE CHOSEN, THEY WILL TURN IT OVER ON DOWNS. KIRK: THIS ROOKIE OUT OF UTAH, COLE BISHOP, MAKES A GREAT PLAY ON THE FOOTBALL. HE GIVES HIM A LITTLE BIT OF A CUSHION. HE LOCATES THE FOOTBALL EARLY AND IT ALLOWS HIM TO TIME IT TO HE IS A BALL HAWK. HE IS OUT OF A GREAT, AGGRESSIVE PROGRAM. AL: THEY LOST BOTH SAFETIES. MICAH HYDE HAS NOT BEEN SIGNED. ONE OF THE THINGS IN THE DRAFT, THEY NOT ONLY NEED A RECEIVER BUT LOOKING FOR A SAFETY AND WOUND UP WITH BISHOP. KIRK: IT IS A BIG WIN FOR IT IS A DIVISION MATCHUP, AND WAS MORE OF A CHALLENGE TO COME JOSH TOLD US LAST NIGHT, I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT MIAMI BUT I PLAY WITH A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE. AL: 1:57 TO GO. THE WILL BE WITH THE PLAYER THE BILLS TAKE OVER ON A SECOND AND 9. TRYING TO TAKE IT TO THE FINISH. KAYLEE, WHAT DO YOU KNOW? KAYLEE: TUA IS IN THE DOLPHINS LOCKER ROOM, WE HAVE SEEN HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AND HIS BROTHER, HE IS CONSCIOUS, AWAKE AND ALERT AS HE WAS WHEN YOU SAW HIM WALKING OFF THE FIELD UNDER HIS OWN POWER. HE HAS FULL MOVEMENT IN HIS EXTREMITIES. AL: THAT IS THE GOOD NEWS, WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS DOWN THE WE HAVE SEEN ENOUGH, WHEN HE GETS HER AND WHAT THAT MEANT A COUPLE YEARS AGO. WE WERE IN CINCINNATI THAT NIGHT. UNBELIEVABLE HE CAME BACK. A LITTLE VICTORY FORMATION, AND THE BUFFALO BILLS HAVE OWNED THE LOOK AT THIS, THE LAST 12 GAMES COMING IN, 11-1, THEY WIN POINT DIFFERENTIAL PER GAME, ON A HOT AND STICKY NIGHT LIKE TONIGHT. TONIGHT IT IS LIKE, FORGET ABOUT IT, IT IS ALL BUFFALO. KIRK: THIS IS A LOT ABOUT WHAT IS RIGHT WITH BUFFALO. WEEK 2, A LONG WAY TO GO BUT THERE IS A LOT TO LIKE ABOUT THIS BUFFALO BILL'S TEAM. AL: THE GANG IS LOOKING TO GET AN EXTRA THREE DAYS OFF. FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY MAKE THE LONG TRIP TO SEATTLE A WEEK FROM SUNDAY. VON MILLER, SACKS IN BACK TO BACK GAMES TO START THIS SEASON. BUFFALO WINS HANDILY WITH A BIG LEAD AT THE HALF. 24-10.
