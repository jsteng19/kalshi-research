COUSINS. KAYLEE: WHAT HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF YOUR TRANSITION? KIRK: IF YOU TAKE ONE STEP BACK AND TRY TO TAKE TWO STEPS FORWARD. WE TRY TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE EACH WEEK. KAYLEE: WHY HASN'T THIS OFFENSE PRODUCED THE LEVEL OF TALENT IN THE FIRST FOUR GAMES? KIRK: WE ARE BUILDING SOMETHING AND IT TAKES TIME AND SO MANY PIECES HAVE TO COME TOGETHER. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TONIGHT TO DO THAT. >> THERE IS THE TRAIN MORNING AND THOSE BOYS ARE THE TWIN SONS OF MATT RYAN AND THERE IS THAT. LONGTIME FALCONS QUARTERBACK, WENT TO THE SUPER BOWL IN 2016 AND HE WILL BE HONORED AT HALFTIME TONIGHT. HERE IN THE STANDINGS, TAMPA BAY COMES IN 3-1 IN ATLANTA 2-1. CAROLINA WITH ONE WIN OVER VEGAS. TRENTON GILL WILL KICKOFF. ATLANTA WON THE TOSS AND THEY WILL RECEIVE. TODD BOWLES WITH THE BUCS, AND THE TAMPA BAY COACH MANY YEARS AGO, MOST RECENTLY THE RAMS DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR. HERE FOR THE FIRST YEAR. THEY START AT THE 30 YARD LINE. KIRK COUSINS. WASHINGTON INTO THE MINNESOTA, FOUR TOUCHDOWNS, FOUR PICKS. THE STATISTICS DON'T SAY MUCH. HE DID LEAD THEM TO THE COME-FROM-BEHIND WIN AGAINST FOR BELLA -- AGAINST PHILADELPHIA. >> THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND THEMSELVES, WE MENTIONED THAT IN THE OPEN, IT'S A BIG OPPORTUNITY TONIGHT AGAINST A VERY AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE. >> START FROM THE PISTOL, ROBINSON IS THE BACK AND GETS A COUPLE. COUSINS COMES UP WITH WASHINGTON, HE CAME UP AT A TIME WHEN ROBERT GRIFFIN HAD A SPECTACULAR ROOKIE SEASON, IT LOOKED LIKE HE WOULD BE THE FRANCHISE QUARTERBACK FOR A MILLION YEARS. EVENTUALLY IT WAS COUSINS, AND HE GOES TO MINNESOTA AND NOW HIS FIRST SEASON IN FALCONS UNIFORM. SECOND AND 8. WIDE OPEN AT THE 50 YARD LINE, KYLE PITTS TO THE 35. EVERYBODY IS WONDERING WHERE HAS HE BEEN? NO CATCHES LAST WEEK, SELDOM USED SO FAR THIS SEASON AND THEY GET HIM IN THE ACTION EARLY. >> TAMPA BAY WALKS UP WITH A LOT OF PRESSURE. THERE HE IS, RIGHT BETWEEN THE SAFETY AND THE CORNER. I LOVE THIS HURRY UP. >> 32 YARD GAIN, TO THE OUTSIDE GOES ROBINSON. WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SHORT LOSS INTO A SMALL GAIN, SECOND DOWN. >> SACK ROBINSON WITH A REALLY SMART, GOOD INDICATOR OF WHAT THEY WILL TRY TO DO TONIGHT. TODD BOWLES IS KNOWN THROUGH THE LEAGUE, A LOT OF DEFENSIVE COACHES LIKE TO FRAME THINGS UP AND HE STILL CALLS THE PLACE. SACK ROBINSON VERY AWARE OF WHAT HE CAN DO. MIXING IN JUST TO CHANGE THE TEMPO, TO KEEP THEM ON THEIR HEELS. >> THAT COME OUT OF THEIR FIRST HUDDLE OF THE NIGHT. SECOND DOWN AND 7. GOOD POCKET, THROWS A LITTLE SHORT. THAT IS DARNELL MOONEY. HE WAS PICKED UP FROM CHICAGO. THAT IS THIRD DOWN AND 7. >> THE DECISION BUT HE DOESN' >> THE DECISION BUT HE DOESN'T THROW IT TO THE OUTSIDE, AND BY BRINGING IT INSIDE IT ALLOWS DEANS TO MAKE A PLAY ON THE FOOTBALL. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE TIMING OF LITTLE THINGS. THEY MIGHT GET OVERLOOKED AND THAT IS ON THE OUTSIDE SHOULDER INTO COMPLETION. >> 7 THIRD AND -- THIRD AND 7. THE FALCONS ON THE MOVE, MUCH AS THE BUCS WERE AGAINST PHILADELPHIA LAST WEEK. >> DRAKE LONDON WILL BE ALL OVER THE PLACE, GOOD SIZE, DOWN IN THE ZONE, MAKES IT EASY FOR COUSINS WHO HAD TIME TO THROW THE FOOTBALL LOOK OVER THE MIDDLE OF THE DEFENSE. WHERE THEY LIKE TO ATTACK, INPUTTED ON THE MONEY. >> GAIN OF 15. HANDS THIS TO ROBINSON AND HE GOES NOWHERE. INTO THE BACKFIELD, MAKING THE STOP, THE BUCS SECOND DOWN AND 10. THE ROOKIE OUT OF GEORGIA MAKES THE TACKLE. >> DOING A GOOD JOB GETTING A LOT OF DIFFERENT HANDS ON THE FOOTBALL, MIXING UP FORMATIONS, IT'S NOT JUST GETTING INTO DRAKE LONDON, IT'S NOT JUST REALLY, THEY'VE TRIED BOTH OF THEM. AS A COLLEGE FOOTBALL GUY, FITS IS ABOUT AS DOMINATING AS I'VE SEEN THE LAST FIVE OR 10 YEARS AND I LOVE SEEING HIM GET HIS HANDS ON THE FOOTBALL EARLY. >> OVER THE MIDDLE, IT IS CAUGHT. DRAKE LONDON FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. THEY MAKE IT LOOK VERY EASY. ONLY TAKES THREE MINUTES AND SIX SECONDS, SEVEN PLAYS, 70 YARDS AND SIX POINTS. >> SEURAT CA -- DENNIS IS OUT OF THE GAME. TAPPED ON THE OPENING DRIVE, QUITE A BIT OVER THE MIDDLE AGAINST THOSE LINEBACKERS. >> THE EXTRA POINT. THE FALCONS LAST WEEK WON AGAINST NEW ORLEANS AND DID NOT SCORE AN OFFENSIVE TOUCHDOWN. TONIGHT IT TAKES A LITTLE OVER THREE MINUTES IN ATLANTA IS UP 7-0. SOFI NBA PLAY. FIRST OFFENSIVE TD IN THE LAST SEVEN DRIVES, THIS IS A RETURN KICK. FIELDED AT THE FOUR YARD LINE BY TUCKER. DOWN THE SIDELINE HE GOES FOR A NICE RUN PAST THE 35 YARD LINE. IF YOU'RE MAYFIELD, QUITE THE JOURNEY, WHAT AN ODYSSEY. NUMBER ONE OVERALL PICK BY CLEVELAND, HE WAS GOING TO BE THE GUY. GOOD START AND THAT FIZZLED AT THE END. DESHAUN WATSON LET HIM OUT THE DOOR, HE GOES TO CAROLINA, AND THEN WINDS UP WITH THE RAMS AND RESETS HIS CAREER ON THAT THURSDAY NIGHT A COUPLE YEARS AGO, LEADING A DRIVE AT THE END OF THE GAME. SIGNED TO TAMPA LAST YEAR, DOES WELL ENOUGH WITH A THREE YEAR, $100 MILLION CONTRACT. WHITE IN THE BACKFIELD AT THE 37 YARD LINE. FIRES, CAUGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 50 YARD LINE. MIKE EVANS, GOING INTO LAST WEEK'S GAME, HE WASN'T LOOKING ENOUGH AND THEY HAD A MAMA FOR TO PASS OF THE GAME LAST WEEK. >> ONE WAY TO CLOSE IN ON THREE TARGETS AGAINST DENVER LAST WEEK AND HERE HE IS. ANYBODY CHEERING FOR A COMEBACK STORY, HE WOULD BE THE FIRST ONES WITH MID HE HAS A LOT TO LEARN. HE LOOKS AT THINGS THROUGH DIFFERENT WINS NOW. -- DIFFERENT LENS NOW. >> LITTLE RUN HEREBY WHITE. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THEY'VE HAD HIS RUNNING. THE BALL WE WILL ALSO SEE A LOT OF BUCKY IRVING TONIGHT. >> THIS LINE I THINK IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. THEY ARE REALLY BUILT, IF YOU GO BACK TO TOM BRADY, LEARNING HOW TO BECOME MORE PHYSICAL AND HOW TO RUN THE FOOTBALL. >> NEARLY PICKED OFF. EVANS WAS THE INTENDED RECEIVER. THROWN OUT IN FRONT. MAYFIELD IS LOOKING FOR A PLAYER WANTS TO KNOW WHY HIS RECEIVER WAS HELD UP. >> GOOD MATCHUP TONIGHT, TERREL A LOT OF TIMES WILL SHADOW THE RECEIVER. I THINK THAT'S WHAT BAKER WAS ASKING FOR, IT IMPACTED HIM TRYING TO WORK INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD. TERRY WAVING IT OFF AND SAY NO INTERFERENCE. HE IS HELPING US EVERY THURSDAY NIGHT. >> THANK GOD. [LAUGHTER] MAYFIELD FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC AND THAT IS PULLED IN. THAT IS EVANS, FORWARD PROGRESS WILL NET HIM A FIRST DOWN. EVANS COULD BE A FIRST BALLOT HALL OF FAMER. EVERY YEAR, OVER 1000 YARDS, HAS TO COME OUT FOR A SECOND. >> A GREAT JOB OF GETTING THE BALL OUT, WATCH THE SAFETY, HE IS FEELING THE 13 AND EVANS WILL GET THIS FOOTBALL. BECAUSE HE GOT TO AN EARLY ENOUGH, HE COULD SECURE THE FOOTBALL AND TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF BEFORE BATES COULD DISLODGE THE BALL. DECISIVE DECISION. >> ROOKIE OUT OF BARTON COMES TOSS BACK. WHITE WILL BE SHOT DOWN AFTER A GAIN OF ONE, MAKING IT SECOND AND 9 FOR THE BUCS. >> YOU MENTIONED BUCKY IRVING, I THINK THE PRESENCE OF HAS PUSHED WHITE TO RUN TOUGHER. >> KAMERON JOHNSON JUST CAME INTO THE GAME WHEN EVANS HAD TO GO OUT, SO HE WOULD BE IN CLOSED THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE IS ABOUT A DATE. -- TEMPERATURE IS ABOUT 80. SECOND DOWN AND NINE. THE RUNNING GAME, THEY ARE HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING ANYTHING GOING AND THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE FOR THE LAST TWO RUNS, THIRD DOWN AND NINE. KIRK: THE DEFENSE FROM ATLANTA IS TROY ANDERSEN. HE IS OUT WITH A KNEE. SO A ROOKIE OUT OF NOTRE DAME IS BOTH LINEBACKERS GETTING DOWNHILL IN A HURRY. THEY WILL MISS ANDERSON TONIGHT. AL: PICK SIX ALSO. THIRD AND NINE. CAUGHT. HE GOES TO THE TIGHT END. BUT IS CADE OTTON. TACKLED BY JD BERTRAND. KIRK: HE WAS USING HIS EYES TO MOVE THE SAFETIES TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE AT THAT NEXT LEVEL. SECOND DOWN. GREAT TIME TO GO TO THIS CALL. BAKER MAYFIELD WAS LOOKING LEFT, LOOKING LEFT. HE LOOKED AT THE SAFETY, BATES. A NICELY EXECUTED PLAY. AL: HE GOT THE GAME-WINNING TOUCHDOWN BETWEEN THE BUCS AND THE FALCONS LAST YEAR. IT IS A FIRST DOWN AND GOAL. CHRIS GODWIN MAKING THE GRAB. WE KNOW HE IS A GREAT RECEIVER BUT WHEN YOU PLAY WITH MIKE EVANS, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE THE SECOND GUY. KIRK: WE TALKED ABOUT THIS THIS MORNING. HE GETS OVERLOOKED. HE IS AS CONSISTENT AND DURABLE AS YOU CAN ASK FOR. NOT CONCERNED AT ALL ABOUT TAKING THE HIT. HE HOLDS ONTO THE FOOTBALL. BOTH OF THESE QUARTERBACKS ARE COMING OUT ON FIRE AND THROWING THE FOOTBALL WITH GREAT ACCURACY. AL: AND THERE IS KAMERON JOHNSON TRYING TO WORK IT OUT ALONG THE SIDELINE. AND YOU HAVE THE INJURED FALCON AT THE 2 YARD LINE AND IT WILL BE FIRST AND GOAL WHEN PLAY RESUMES. ALFORD IS A DEFENSIVE BACK AND HE HAS TO COME OUT OF THE GAME BEFORE THE FIRST AND GOAL. THIS IS THE NINTH PLAY OF THE DRIVE THAT BEGAN AT THEIR OWN 37 IF YOU ARE JUST TUNING IN, THE FALCONS WENT DOWN THE FIELD ON THEIR FIRST DRIVE. KIRK: THEY BRING IN THE ROOKIE, BUCKY IRVING, TO THE BACKFIELD HERE EARLY IN HIS CAREER. A VERY PHYSICAL RUNNER WHO IS UNDERSIZED, 5'10" BUT HE RUNS TOUGH. IT MAKES SENSE THEY WOULD BRING HIM IN AND WHITE IS STILL IN THERE WITH HIM. YOU SEE THEM MOVE HIM OUT TO THE RIGHT. AL: PICKTON THE FOURTH ROUND GOT PICKE -- PICKED IN THE FOURTH ROUND. FIG TOSS -- FAKE TOSS. EVANS COMES BACK INTO THE GAME AND SCORES. EACH TEAM WITH A BEAUTIFULLY EXECUTED OPENING DRIVE. KIRK: LIAM COHEN, THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, TAKING A PAGE OUT OF THE ANDY REID BOOK. HE COMES BACK AND NO ONE PICKS HIM UP. YOU CAN SEE TERREL, THEY ARE CONFUSED BECAUSE OF THE MOVEMENT HALF OF THE DEFENSE IS PLAYING MAN. NO ONE PICKS HIM UP. AL: MCLAUGHLIN FOR THE EXTRA POINT. WHEN YOU GET MIKE EVANS THAT OPEN, IT HAS TO BE A BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED PLAY, OR A BUST OR BOTH. 7-7. TAMPA. 43-28. MATT RYAN, FOUR TOUCHDOWNS. THERE HE IS. HE WILL BE HONORED AT HALFTIME AND OUR TONY GONZALES WILL BE THERE. HE IS GOING INTO THE RING OF HONOR. KIRK: WHAT A GREAT CAREER. AL: A TOUCHBACK. THIS IS GIL KICKING OFF. KIRK: BOTH OF THE QUARTERBACKS PLAYING VERY WELL IN THEIR OPENING DRIVES. THE FALCONS FIGHTING PITS -- FINDING PITTS. THERE IS WANDA DRAKE LONDON AND THEN OFF TO THE LEFT HE GETS THE LINEBACKER. READING THE EYES. HE SHOWS A LITTLE POWER THERE AFTER THE CATCH GETTING INTO THE END ZONE. THE OPENING DRIVE -- PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THE 34-YEAR-OLD WHO CAME OVER. THE TIMING LOOKS VERY GOOD SO FAR TONIGHT. AL: OFF THE FAKE. A TON OF TIME. RIGHT ON THE MONEY! MOONEY, MAKING THE GRAB. KIRK: NICE PLAY-ACTION. WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE TIMING. THEY GO HEAVY, THE LINEBACKERS ARE DOWNHILL. THAT IS A MISMATCH WITH MOODY'S SPEED. THE BALL WAS OUT IN FRONT GIVING HIM A CHANCE. AL: AGAIN OF 20 -- A GAIN OF 20. THE RUNNING BACK GOES ON THE PATTERN AND TAKES THE PASS. THE TACKLE IS MADE BY YAYA THE ABI. KIRK: A LOT OF TEAMS HAVE TWO BACKS IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE LEAGUE BUT I THINK YOU COULD MAKE A STRONG ARGUMENT THAT IF ROBINSON LIVES UP TO HIS POTENTIAL AS A THREE DOWN BACK AND YOU PUT TYLER ALGIERS IN THERE TOGETHER, WHAT A COMBO. THAT PUTS SOME POP ON THE DEFENSE. AL: TYLER ALGIERS TOUCHES IT BACK. NICE RUN FOR A GAIN OF 9. YOU HAVE A NICE YING AND YANG KIRK: ALGIERS HAS A NATURAL FIT. HE READS THIS BETTER THAN ROBINSON AT THIS STAGE OF HIS CAREER. DO YOU SEE THE STEP, THE RIGHT STEP RIGHT THERE -- HE READS IT AND FEELS IT AND IS ABLE TO GET NORTH AND SOUTH. WHEN HE BUILDS THAT MOMENTUM AND ACCELERATES THROUGH THE HOLE, HE HAS A HANDFUL FOR THE SAFETIES TO COME UP AND TACKLE. AL: THE PASS WILL GET CAUGHT ALONG THE SIDELINE. GETTING FREE AGAIN IS MCLEOD. HE BEATS TYKEE SMITH, THE ROOKIE FOR A GAIN OF 15. KIRK: THEY CONTINUE TO MIX THINGS UP NICELY. A LOT MORE THROWING ON FIRST AND 10 AND NOT JUST PLAY-ACTION. THAT TIME THEY DROPPED BACK AND GOT MCLEOD INVOLVED. THAT IS 10.5 YARDS PER PLAY THAT ATLANTA IS AVERAGING IN THESE FIRST TWO DRIVES. AL: COUSINS, 102. HERE COMES MOODY. MOODY IS GOING TO THROW BUT NO ONE IS HOME AND HE THROWS IT AWAY. IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND 10. KIRK: ANYTIME A GUY HAS TO REVERSE, HE IS LOSING GROUND. ZACH ROBINSON, HE CALLED SOMETHING IN THESE FIRST -- THE ONLY TIME ZACH ROBINSON CALLED SOMETHING THAT DIDN' SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T WORK. AL: THERE IS TIME BOWLES ON THE OTHER SIDE WHO LOVES TO BLITZ FROM HIS YEARS IN TAMPA BAY. HE BLITZ IS ON 47% OF THE RUNNING PLAYS AND THE NFL AVERAGE IS LESS THAN 30% OR RIGHT AROUND THAT MARK, ANYWAY. SECOND DOWN AND 10. TO THE OUTSIDE. THE RUN TO THE 19 YARD LINE IS DRAKE LONDON AND THAT WILL SET UP THIRD AND 5 FOR ATLANTA. B JON ROBINSON COMES BACK INTO KIRK: IN THESE SITUATIONS WITH PITTS AT 6'6" AND LONDON AT 6'4", THOSE ARE SOME BIG TARGETS TO TRY TO FIND. AL: FLIPS TO THE LEFT SIDE. THIRD AND FIVE. UNDER PRESSURE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND DOWN HE GOES! SOONER OR LATER, THE SACK. THE BULLMOOSE AT 347 POUNDS. HOW DO YOU KEEP HIM OUT? KIRK: TODD BOWLES HAS SEVEN OUT TIGHT AND THEN THEY DROP AND IT CONFUSES THE OFFENSIVE LINE ENOUGH. THAT IS VITA VEA BEING -- ROBINSON IS KNOWN FOR HIS ABILITY TO PICK UP THE BLITZ BUT HE IS NOT PICKING UP THE BIG FELLA COMING IN AT 350 POUNDS. AL: VITA VEA BUSTING THROUGH. KOO GOT THE 58 YARD ONE IN THE WIND TO WIN THE GAME. THE KICK FOR THE MOMENT IS NO GOOD. THE PENALTY IS INDICATED AGAINST AND IT WAS A FOURTH AND 14. RONALD TORBERT MAKES HIS FIRST CALL OF THE NIGHT. KAYLEE: OFFSIDE REFEREE: OFFSIDE, DEFENSE, NUMBER 32. AL: JOSH HAYESAL: TO THE CONSTERNATION OF THE BUCS' CONSTERNATION OF THE BUCS' HEAD COACH. KIRK: LINED UP THERE OFFSIDES. AL: SO NOW IT IS A 41 YARD ATTEMPT FOR KOO/ AND THIS ONE --HE MISSES THAT ONE! ALMOST AN INSTANT REPLAY -- OF ALL THINGS. 58 TO WIN LAST WEEK. KAYLEE: BACK IN ATLANTA WHERE THE BUCCANEERS CAME INTO TOWN WITH FIVE RECEIVERS AVAILABLE AND NOW THEY ARE DOWN TO FOUR. KAMERON JOHNSON IS ON THE BIKE. HE IS QUESTIONABLE TO RETURN. AND DEE ALFORD IS IN THEIR LOCKER ROOM BEING EVALUATED FOR A CONCUSSION WITH THE NEURO- TRAUMA CONSULTANT. AL: THE PASS IS CAUGHT AND OFF TO THE RACES GOES GODWIN PICKING UP THE FIRST DRIVE OF THE FIRST PLAY -- THE FIRST DOWN OF THE FIRST PLAY OF THIS DRIVE. KIRK: HE GOT THE REDO, KOO. BAKER, THE BIG THING THEY WANT TO SEE FROM BAKER MAYFIELD IS LET'S STACK WEEKS TOGETHER. LET'S BE CONSISTENT. HE LOOKED GREAT LAST WEEK, DECISIVE AND TONIGHT, HE IS DOING WELL. AL: A GOOD RUN, BREAKING TACKLES GOES BUCKY IRVING PROVIDING A SPARK FOR THE RUNNING GAME AT 5'10", 195. KIRK: GOT THE POLE AROUND THE GUARD. YOU GET SOME GOOD LOCKS. GOD WENT -- HE MISSED BUT HE IS ABLE TO GET IN THE WAY AND YOU THE QUICKNESS OF BUCKY IRVING WHO CAN ACCELERATE AT A VERY DIFFERENT LEVEL. HE RUNS WITH A CHIP ON HER SHOULDER. HE WAS AT MINNESOTA. MOST PEOPLE REMEMBER WHAT HE DID LAST YEAR AT YEAR. AL: BAKER MAYFIELD WITH THE FAKE AIR PROTECTION IS GOOD. INCOMPLETE! INTENDED FOR STERLING SHEPARD. STERLING SHEPARD HAD BEEN ON THE PRACTICE SQUAD AND PLAYED WITH THE GIANTS, EIGHTH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE. IT LOOKED LIKE HIS CAREER WAS OVER BUT HE AND MAYFIELD WERE TOGETHER AT OKLAHOMA. KIRK: IT IS GOOD TO SEE HIM GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING ENERGY TO THE TEAM LAST WEEK. MAYFIELD HAD THE SAFETY WRITING UP. THEY HAD THAT. THEY HAD OWENS SETTING IT UP BECAUSE MIKE EVANS IS GETTING SO MUCH ATTENTION. HE BROUGHT JUSTIN SIMMONS DOWN. MY GREED JUST MISSES -- MIKE REED JUST MISSES THE THROW. AL: JUST A LITTLE SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN, CHRIS GODWIN AND JUSTIN SIMMONS MAKING THE STOP. THAT IS AS GOOD A PAIR OF RECEIVERS AS YOU WILL SEE IN THE LEAGUE, EVANS AND GODWIN. KIRK: AND I WHOEVER IRVING AND WHITE TOGETHER. ATLANTA IS PERPLEXING. THEY WILL BLITZ ESPECIALLY ON A THIRD DOWN MORE THAN ANYONE IN THE LEAK AND YET THEY ARE NOT GETTING HOME. THEY ARE TRYING TO SEE IT THEY CAN AFFECT THE TIMING AND RHYTHM TONIGHT OF NUMBER SIX, BAKER MAYFIELD. AL: THE BACK IS WHITE. A GOOD PASS. AND THEY SAY THE PAST IS INCOMPLETE GOING BEHIND GODWIN. MIKE HUGHES COVERING ON THE PLAY, A FORMER FIRST-ROUND PICK OF THE MINNESOTA VIKINGS. AND IT IS FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: IT GOES INTO THE BOUNDARY TO HIS GUY GODWIN. HUGHES IS SOFT. HE IS GOOD ON THIRD DOWN BUT HE DOESN'T THROW THE BALL IN FRONT OF HIM TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO MAKE THAT CATCH AND THERE IS NOTHING GODWIN CAN DO. AL: A 53 YARD FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT FOR CHASE GODWIN. THEY GET THE 11TH GUY BACK ON THE FIELD IN A HURRY AND FROM 53. 53 MCLAUGHLIN SENT IT RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE. 1:22 REMAINING IN THE QUARTER. AL: TODD BOWLES TOOK OVER WHEN BRUCE ARIANS RETIRED. BRUCE ARIANS WINNING THE SUPER BOWL TITLE WITH BRADY. TODD WAS THE HEAD COACH OF THE NEW YORK JETS FOR FOUR YEARS. GOT OFF TO A GOOD START. BUT THEN -- BUT THEN -- AND IT HAPPENS TO EVERYBODY. HE BOUNCED AROUND SINCE THEN GETTING ON THE STAFF ARE BRUCE ARIANS AS HIS DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR AND THEN HE ASCENDED TO THE TOP SPOT AND HAS TAKEN THE TEAM TO THE PLAYOFFS IN HIS TWO YEARS AT THE HELM. TRENTON GILL TO KICK OFF. AND THE NEXT PLAY WILL EMANATE FROM THE 30. KIRK: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AARON RODGERS COMING BACK FROM A TORN ACHILLES AND KIRK COUSINS, THE SAME THING. THAT RIGHT FOOT, PUSHING OFF IT AND 11 MONTHS LATER AFTER THE SURGERY, HE IS STILL TRYING TO GET THE CONFIDENCE IN HIS BACK FOOT. YOU CAN SEE THAT HE'LL COMING UP OFF THE GROUND WHICH AFFECTS THE VELOCITY. THE BALL IS DYING ON HIM A LITTLE IF HE IS THROWING IT 20, 30, 40 YARDS DOWN THE PLAY. A WORK IN PROGRESS TRYING TO GET CONFIDENCE IN THE ACHILLES AND WORKING WITH NEW RECEIVERS. AL: ROBINSON -- HE AVOIDS A TACKLE AND PICKS UP ABOUT SIX. LONDON THROUGH A NICE BLOCK TO SPRING HIM FOR A SIX YARD GAIN. SECOND DOWN AND FOUR. KIRK: 34 YEARS OLD, YOU COME INTO A NEW SYSTEM AND PEOPLE ASSUME IT IS GOING TO COME TOGETHER. TONIGHT HE LOOKS GREAT. BUT SOMETIMES IT TAKES TIME TO DEVELOP THAT ESPECIALLY COMING OFF THAT INJURY. AL: A NEW SYSTEM, NO OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR -- A NEW OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. LOOKING FOR WOO. NOT MUCH THERE. KAYLEE: MATTHEW JUDON JUNE, A SURPRISING COMPARISON. HE SAYS HE HAS NOT LIKE LAMAR JACKSON, KIRK COUSINS BUT HE IS LIKE LAMAR IS IN BALTIMORE. AL: HE HAS ALWAYS HAD THAT REPUTATION. HE THROWS HERE TO MOODY TO THE 44 YARD LINE AND THAT WILL SET UP A FIRST DOWN AND PERHAPS THE LAST PLAY OF THE COURTS ARE. THEY COULD LET IT RUN DOWN. INSIDE 10. THEY COME UP TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE TRYING TO DRAW TAMPA BAY OFFSIDE IF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT IS THE END OF THE QUARTER. A GOOD SPIRITED FIRST QUARTER ON THURSDAY NIGHT. AL: RED PANDA -- LOOK AT THIS! ON THE UNICYCLE. SHE MUST HAVE BEEN PHENOMENAL ON THE BALANCE BEAM AT ONE POINT. A VERY POPULAR FIGURE CURED AL MICHAELS WITH KIRK HERBSTREIT AND KAYLEE HARTUNG. WE ARE STARTING THE SECOND QUARTER. FROM THE 43 YARD LINE. BEING CHASED, ON THE MOVE AND THROWING IT AWAY. KAYLEE: MATTHEW JUDON TOLD ME THAT KIRK COUSINS DOESN'T STAY HIDDEN. HE IS IN THE LOCKER ROOM HANGING OUT LIKE ONE OF THE D LINEMAN. HIS AGE STILL SHOWS. DO DON SAYS COUSINS WILL START TO TALK ABOUT OLD STUFF. HE WILL REMIND HIM, THAT HAPPENED FOREVER AGO. AL: THE CROWD IS BOOING BECAUSE THEY FELT IT SHOULD'VE BEEN A PERSONAL FOUL ON COUSINS. FIRED OVER THE MIDDLE INDO TRAFFIC. -- FIRED OVER THE MIDDLE AND INTO TRAFFIC. IT WAS INTENDED FOR LONDON. AND WE HAVE A FLAG. THE SECOND PENALTY OF THE GAME. EITHER AN DOCKED THE FIRST WAS AN OFFSIDE ON A FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT. REFEREE: PERSONAL FOUL. UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS, DEFENSE, NUMBER 52. AL: IT IS ON K.J. BRITT. HERE IT IS. RIGHT THERE. KIRK: A SHOULDERED THE HEAD. THIS WAS THE PREVIOUS PLAY WHERE LOGAN HALL, AFTER HE THROWS IT ACTUALLY PULLS BACK. ANYTIME A QUARTERBACK GOES DOWN EVERYONE IS ALWAYS LEERY WONDERING IF A FLAG WILL COME AL: ESPECIALLY THE HOME CROWD. TO THE OUTSIDE, ALGIERS PICKS UP -- ANOTHER FLAG. WE ARE 17 SECONDS IN. KIRK:AL HI -- AL HIGH-FIVED ME AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER SAYING, ONLY ONE FLAG. REFEREE: HOLDING, OFFENSE, 10 YARD PENALTY. IT WILL BE FIRST DOWN. AL: THE CENTER. KIRK: HIS HANDS ARE FULL TONIGHT. AGAINST GAINES AND VITA VEA. GREG GAINES IS A BACKUP CENTER. 301 POUNDS. THEY ARE RUNNING THE OUTSIDE ZONE AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GET THESE GUYS TO GOAD LATERALLY. IT IS EASY TO LOCK UP ON HIM IF LOSE LEVERAGE. AL: THAT IS A FIRST DOWN IN 20. TO THE OUTSIDE QUICKLY. LOOKING FOR A BLOCK. AND WORKING HIS WAY IS RAY-RAY MCCLOUD, SEVEN YEARS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO AT ONE POINT. THEY PICKED HIM UP FROM THE 49ERS. KIRK: HE HAS BEEN MORE OF A RETURN MAN, SPECIAL TEAMS GUY. I KERLEY YARD -- IKE HILLYARD WAS ADAMANT. WE HAVE ROBINSON AND TYLER ALGIERS SO WE NEED THAT POSITION AND THEY WANTED TO GIVE RAY-RAY MCCLOUD A CHANCE. AL: PRESSURE COMING. END OF THE POCKET. WIDE OPEN. HE SECURES THE BALL AT THE 20. AND THEY GO TO HODGE, HIS FIRST CATCH OF THE NIGHT. THEY HAVE ALREADY INVOLVED SIX DIFFERENT RECEIVERS. THAT IS A GAIN OF 22. KIRK: LOGAN HALL -- ONCE AGAIN THEY ARE PICKING ON THE INTERIOR OF THE TAMPA BAY DEFENSE WHETHER WE HAVE SEEN BRITT BACK THERE, AND OUTSIDE LINEBACKER DROPPING BACK IN COVERAGE. THEY ARE TRYING TO GO AFTER THE INTERIOR FOR THE TAMPA DEFENSE. AL: THANKS THE TOSS AND THEN DOES THROW IT. COMING BACK THIS WAY AND A NICE TACKLE BUT A IN AT THE END. ROBINSON MAKES A GRAB. THE PENALTY MARKER IS AT THE 18 YARD LINE JUST PAST THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. REFEREE: HOLDING. OFFENSE, NUMBER EIGHT. 10 YARD PENALTY. KIRK: YOU CALLED IT. THIS IS AFTER THE COMPLETION. BIJAN ROBINSON WORKS HIS WAY BACK TOWARDS PITTS AND THAT IS WHERE HE GRABS A HOLD OF THE DEFENDER THAT TIME, TYKEE THAT IS THE ONE THING THAT HURT ATLANTA LAST WEEK. THEY WOULD GET INTO PLUS TERRITORY AND THEN SELF INFLICTING A LOT OF PENALTIES WHICH IS WHY THEY DID NOT HAVE AN OFFENSIVE TOUCHDOWN LAST WEEK. PRETTY FLAWLESS THE FIRST FEW DRIVES. AL: FIRST AND 20. THE PASS IS CAUGHT BUT FOR A SHORT AGAIN. -- A SHORT GAIN. MACCALLUM IS ASCENDING TO THE STARTING ROLE. KIRK: HE HAS BEEN THERE AS THE THIRD CORNER BEHIND DAVIS. HE WORKED HIS WAY INTO THAT SPOT. AL: THAT PASS IS INCOMPLETE. IT IS LAMONTE DAVID WHO MAKES HIS PRESENCE FELT AS HE HAS SO MANY TIMES OVER 13 SEASONS IN THE LEAGUE. BREAKING IT OUT. THIRD AND 14. KIRK: IT IS AMAZING TO WATCH HIM PLAY AT 34 YEARS OLD AND HIS GREATEST INSTINCT -- AND HIS GREATEST STRENGTH IS HIS INSTINCT AND SAVVY. AND HIS ABILITY TO COVERED. LOOK AT THE RIGHT HAND AND ARM EXTEND KNOCK THE BALL AWAY. USING HIS EYES ON THE QUARTERBACK TO KNOW WHEN THE BALL IS COMING. AL: OVER THE MIDDLE. MOONEY IS IN THERE, TOUCHDOWN! FIRED IN TO TRAFFIC FROM 25 YARDS OUT ON A THIRD AND 14. AND ATLANTA RETAKES THE LEAD. KIRK: BECAUSE OF THEIR SUCCESS THROWING INTO THE MIDDLE, THEY MOVED MCCOLLUM TO TAKE AWAY THE POTENTIAL OF ANY RECEIVER THAT WILL WORK IN THEIR. YOU HAVE A CORNER WORKING IN THEIR. BY THE TIME HE TURNS AROUND BECAUSE COUSINS THREW IT ON THE LINE HE DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO ADJUST TO THE BALL AND TALK ABOUT ADJUSTMENT, WHAT A JOB BY DARNELL MOONEY TO MAKE THAT CATCH UP IN THE AIR. AL: AND THEY GO "KOO" FOR THE EXTRA POINT. COUSINS HAS ALREADY THROWN FOR 176 YARDS AL: THE SEASON FINALE OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS: RINGS OF POWER PREMIERING TONIGHT ONLY ON CRIME. STAY TUNED FOR THE CONCLUSION OF ONE OF THE BEST TV SHOWS OF THE SPEAKING OF RINGS, THE OLYMPIC RINGS. CHECKING OUT LONDON ON THE DRAKE LONDON BEING CHECKED OUT ON THE ATLANTA BENCH. HE JOGS BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM. THIS IS A LINE DRIVE KICK THAT WILL BE RETURNED FROM THE 4 YARD LINE. TUCKER WORKS HIS WAY OUT PAST THE 30. HE IS STILL ON HIS FEET. THERE HE GOES AND FINALLY TACKLED BY THE LAST MAN THAT CAN GET HIM. SEAN TUCKER, SECOND YEAR GUY OUT OF SYRACUSE AND MIKE ABERNATHY, THE LAST GUY DOWN THERE WAS ABLE TO SAVE IT AT THE ATLANTA 44 KIRK: THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR. EVERY TIME YOU WATCH AND NFL GAME YOU WANT TO SEE A BIG RETURN. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 MS. TACKLES AND GOOD HARD RUNNING BY THE BACK OUT OF SYRACUSE IN HIS SECOND AL: HE RAN INTO A COUPLE OF HIS OWN GUYS OVER THERE. HERE IS MAYFIELD THROWING ON THE RUN. CAUGHT AT THE 40 YARD LINE. BREAKING TACKLES ALL OVER THE PLACE. INSIDE THE 25 HE GOES FOR A GAIN OF 22. KIRK: AND THIS WAS THE BAKER MAYFIELD AND OFFENSE LAST WEEK AGAINST PHILLY. A LOT OF LEVELS CONCEPTS HERE. GET THE BALL OUT, GET IT TO OTTEN. A BIG GUY. HE SHOWS HIS LENGTH TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE CATCH AND THEN HE DOES NOT GO OUT OF BOUNDS. AL: MAYFIELD, A GAIN OF 11. OTTEN SCORED TWO. AND STUFFED IT AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE IS ROCHON WHITE BY SMITH WILLIAMS. KIRK: THEY ARE TRYING TO GET THE RUNNING GAME GOING. YOU MENTIONED IT EARLY IN THE GAME AND WITHOUT THEIR RIGHT TACKLE, GOEDEKE, IT HAS BEEN HARD TO GET IT GOING. LOOK AT THAT, LAST 22, 23, 24, IT HAS BEEN TOUGH AND THIS OFFENSIVE LINE IS BUILT TO BE BETTER AT PASS PROTECTING THEN DRIVING PEOPLE OFF THE BALL. THEY WANT TO TRY TO EMPHASIZE IT AND MAKE SOMETHING TEAMS HAVE TO RESPECT. AL: WIDE OPEN! EVANS, TOUCHDOWN! 23 YARDS -- IT IS THE 100TH TOUCHDOWN OF HIS CAREER ON 99 RECEPTIONS. KIRK: BAKER LOVES THAT THROW -- ANY TIME HE CAN GET THE CORNER ROUTE ESPECIALLY TO HIS GUY EVANS. HE IS READING THE SAFETY AND NOW HE HAS THE ONE-ON-ONE OPPORTUNITY. THAT IS A MISMATCH AGAINST THE BACKUP NICKEL. WHAT A TOUGH ASK FOR HAMILTON TO BE ABLE TO STAY WITH MIKE EVANS ON THAT OUTSIDE ROUTE. AL: 99 RECEIVING TOUCHDOWNS AND ONE FUMBLE RECOVERY SO THERE IS THE 100TH FOR EVANS. EVANS WITH THE SECOND TOUCHDOWN PASS OF THE NIGHT FROM BAKER A 53 YARD KICKOFF RETURN STARTED IT. AND HE GIV AL: ONE WEEK FROM TONIGHT ON THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, OFF WE GO TO THE WEST COAST TO SEATTLE. THE SEAHAWKS AND THE 49ERS ON THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL FOR WHAT HAS BECOME ONE OF THE GREAT RIVALRIES IN THE NFL. SAN FRANCISCO AND SEATTLE NEXT 17-14, TAMPA BAY IS ON TOP. TRENTON GILL SENDS IT SKYWARD. FIVE YARDS INTO THE END ZONE. A TOUCHBACK. KAYLEE: MIKE EVANS KEEPS GIVING AWAY PIECES OF BUCS HISTORY TO GUYS WEARING 13 -- NUMBER 13 JERSEYS. HE SAID HE DID NOT THINK ABOUT KEEPING THAT LAST ONE BECAUSE HE IS ONLY THINKING ABOUT GETTING AND KEEPING THE 100TH BALL. THAT IS HIS 100TH TOUCHDOWN BUT HE HAS HIS EYE ON A CAREER MILESTONE FOR THE TOUCHDOWN CATCH. THE NEXT BALL IS THE ONE HE'S GOING TO KEEP. WE HOPE. KIRK: GO DOWN AND TAPPED HIM ON THE SHOULDER AND REMIND HIM. AL: AND WHAT ABOUT THE FUMBLE RECOVERY? YOU KEEP THROWING. DURING THE COMMERCIAL WE WERE WATCHING THE GUYS THROWING THE BALL AROUND AND THAT BALL IS GOING TO BE ON EBAY. KIRK: I CANNOT BELIEVE IT CAME BACK TO THE ORIGINAL OWNER. HE IS FIRED UP. I'VE NEVER SEEN A GUY SO EXCITED ABOUT GETTING A FOOTBALL. HE IS READY TO GO. LET'S SEE IF THE DEFENSE CAN MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS AND GET THE QUARTERBACKS OUT OF RHYTHM. BOTH OF THESE GUYS ARE PLAYING GREAT FOOTBALL. AL: GOOD PROTECTION. OPEN, THE CATCH IS MADE. OFF TO THE RACES. A GAIN OF 19 FOR THE TIGHT END. HE HAS TWO CATCHES AND 50 YARDS. KIRK: THEY MOVED HIM FROM IN-LINE TO OUT WIDE BEFORE THE SNAP. IT IS ZONE SO HE GETS UNDERNEATH HIM. AT 6'6" IT IS NOT HARD TO GOOD HARD THROW GIVES HIM A CHANCE TO GET BETWEEN THE LINEBACKER AND THE SAFETY AFTER THE CATCH. IT IS GREAT TO SEE NUMBER EIGHT GET HIS HANDS ON THE FOOTBALL FOR ATLANTA. AL: NOTHING HAPPENING HERE BUT THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, BREAKING TACKLES AGAIN IS BIJAN ROBINSON WHO TURNS NO GAIN YARDS. KIRK: HE IS LOCKING HIM UP AND HAS HIM DOWN BUT IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF HOW TOUGH AND PHYSICAL BIJAN ROBINSON IS. AL: SECOND AND FOUR. FIRED. BLOOD IS GOING TO BE HAULED -- THAT IS GOING TO BE HAULED IN AT THE 38 YARD LINE. FIRST DOWN. KIRK: IT IS REALLY NICE TO SEE COZZENS GET HIM THE BALL -- COUSINS GET HIM THE BALL. HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIS THIRD OR FOURTH OPTION. HE CAME BACK TO GET THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD WHERE HE IS FEASTING ON THE DEFENSE AND HE IS NOW 10 OF 11. IT IS EARLY IN THE GAME. 156 YARDS AND TWO TOUCHDOWNS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD. AL: 202 YARDS IN A QUARTER AND A HALF FOR COUSINS. THE BALL IS LOOSE. THERE IS A SCRAMBLE FOR IT. JORDAN WHITEHEAD COMES IN. BUCS SAY THEY HAVE IT AND THERE IS A FLAG. KIRK: INTENTIONAL GROUNDING. HE GOT THE BALL OUT BUT WAS THROWING IT TO NOBODY. I THINK HE WAS WILLING TO TAKE THE INTENTIONAL GROUNDING TO AVOID GETTING THE BALL KNOCKED LOOSE. AL: THAT WAS A FIRST END 10. REFEREE: THE RULING ON THE FIELD IS THAT THE QUARTERBACK THREW A FORWARD PASS BUT THERE WAS NO RECEIVER IN THE AREA. IT IS INTENTIONAL GROUNDING BY THE OFFENSE, NUMBER 18. A10 YARD PENALTY. LOSS OF A DOWN. KIRK: THE LAST DRIVE THEY HAD THEY OVERCAME SOME PENALTIES AND THERE WAS A FIRST DOWN 20. WATCH THE RIGHT HAND. HE FLIPS IT. HE KNEW WHAT IT WOULD COST HIM BUT HE DID NOT WANT THE POTENTIAL OF LOSING THE FOOTBALL SO HE GOT RID OF IT. AL: MAKING SURE THE ARM COMES IT MAKES IT SECOND DOWN AND 20. AND A STOPPAGE HERE. A TAMPA CHALLENGE ON THAT PLAY. TAMPA WILL NOW PROBABLY CHALLENGE AND CONTEND THAT IT WAS A FUMBLE. REFEREE: TAMPA BAY HAS CHALLENGED THE RULING ON THE FIELD WITH THE QUARTERBACKS FORWARD PASS AND THE PREVIOUS PLAY IS UNDER REVIEW. TIMEOUT ON THE FIELD. KIRK: ATLANTA RECOVERED IT SO IF IT IS A FUMBLE, THE FALCONS GOT ON TOP OF THE BALL. AL: EXACTLY. REFEREE: AFTER REVIEWING THE PLAY, THE RULING STANDS AS CALLED. TAMPA WILL BE CHARGED. KIRK: IT IS VERY CLEAR YOU COULD SEE THE RIGHT HAND COMING WE SAID HE WAS GETTING RID OF THE BALL UNDERSTANDING HE WOULD GET THE FLAG ANYWAYS. AL: DRAKE LONDON COMES BACK FROM THE LOCKER ROOM. ROBINSON TAKES IT TO THE 40 YARD KAYLEE: DRAKE LUND AND HAS BEEN CLEARED TO GO BACK INTO THE GAME AFTER BEING EVALUATED FOR A CONCUSSION. YOU SAW THAT VIDEO EARLIER WHERE DRAKE WAS GRABBED ON THE SIDELINE AND TAKEN TO THE LOCKER ROOM. THE FALCONS DEFENSIVE BACK HAS BEEN RULED OUT BECAUSE HE DOES HAVE A CONCUSSION. AL: TYKEE SMITH WAS HEARD ON THE LAST PLAY, THE ROOKIE THIRD ROUND PICK OUT OF GEORGIA. HE NEEDS THE ATTENTION BEFORE THIRD DOWN AND 14 WHEN PLAY KIRK: I THINK HE FELT HIS OWN PLAYER, K.J. BRITT WHO WAS RUNNING AND CHASING THE BALL AND ENDED UP HITTING HIS OWN MAN. JUST TOWARDS THE END OF THE PLAY. IT IS GOOD TO SEE HIM UP. K.J. BRITT BRINGS IT. 52, RIGHT THERE WITH THE HELMET BUT SMITH IS UP AND OFF TO THE AL: HE GOES BACK TO THE BENCH. THEY ARE ALREADY MINUS ANTOINE WINFIELD WHO HAS BEEN OUT WITH THE LAST -- FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS WITH A FOOT INJURY. THOMAS COMES IN ON A THIRD AND 14 FROM THE 42. IN THE POCKET. HE FLARES IT OUT. DOWN YEAR'S -- -- ALGIERS AND HE GETS TAKEN OUT AT THE 36 BY LAMONTE DAVID. FOURTH DOWN AND IT LOOKS LIKE KOO IS GOING TO COME IN AFTER HE MISSED A 41 YARDER EARLIER. IF YOUR NAME IS KOO, YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE CHANTING YOUR NAME OR, MISSING A 41 YARD FIELD GOAL -- KIRK: IT IS TOUGH. I'M FEELING THIS ONE. HE IS GOING TO HIT THIS. AL: 54? AND -- YOU FELT IT RIGHT. INSIDE THE LEFT UPRIGHT. 50 YARD FIELD GOALS IN THE NFL ARE A DIME A DOZEN THIS YEAR. 6:17 TO THE HALF AND WE ARE LOCKED AT 17-17. KIRK: HE JUST NEEDED TO MOVE BACK A LITTLE BIT TO FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE. AL: LIKE LAST WEEK IN DALLAS. KIRK: I WATCH THESE KICKERS WARMING UP FROM 50 LIKE IT IS 35 AND I'M ALWAYS ENAMORED HOW THESE GUYS ARE HANGING THESE 55 AND 60 YARDS. AL: WE DID NOT KNOW THIS OR SEE THIS. THIS IS KAYLEE HARTUNG, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ABOUT A WEEK AGO. KIRK: SHE IS CRAZY. AL: WE KNEW THAT ALREADY. KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE SHE IS ENJOYING HERSELF YOU ARE CRAZY. KAYLEE: IT WAS A BLAST. WIND AND DONE -- THAT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. THERE MIGHT'VE BEEN DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT I WOULD TRY THAT TONIGHT LIVE. LET'S ROLL THE TAPE AND GET AS MUCH BANG FOR OUR BUCK AS WE CAN. IT IS A LITTLE CRAZY LOOKING UP AT IT DOWN HERE TONIGHT. KIRK: AND THEY SAID AL'S NEXT WEEK. AL: AL JEROME. KAYLEE DID NOT EVEN GET ANY LESSONS FROM TOM CRUISE. THIS WAS TWO YEARS AGO ON A BAKER MAYFIELD FLIES INTO LOS ANGELES ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON. HE IS WITH SEAN MCVAY. FOR 48 HOURS. NO SLEEP. HE LEARNS THE PLAYBOOK AND COMES END OF THE GAME AND LEADS THEM ON THE 98 YARD DRIVE AT THE END OF THE GAME TO WIN IT. KIRK: NO TIMEOUTS, HE HAD BEEN THERE FOR TWO DAYS -- HOW THE HECK DID THAT HAPPEN? AL: HE KNEW THE PLAYBOOK AS WELL AS HE NEEDED TO. AND BEFORE THE GAME TONIGHT, HE WAS GETTING HIMSELF ALL HEPPED UP BY LOOKING A VIDEOS IN HIS LOCKER. KIRK: NAME A QUARTERBACK IN THE NFL THAT TO GET HIS MIND RIGHT WOULD WATCH MIKE TYSON. I COULD UNDERSTAND A SAFETY OR A PASS RUSHER BUT THIS IS A QUARTERBACK AND IT TELLS YOU HOW HE PLAYS THE GAME. AL: HE WAS HEADBUTTING GUYS AT CAROLINA WITH THEIR HELMETS AND HIS BARE HEAD. FIRST DOWN FROM THE 29 YARD WHITE, STILL MOVING! WHITE, INSIDE THE 30 AND TAKEN DOWN AT THE 10 YARD LINE BY TERRELL. HE EXPLODES FOR 56. KIRK: ABLE TO RUN THE COUNTERPLAY, THE PLAYS SIDE HAS TO DO A GOOD JOB OF ESTABLISHING THAT TO OPEN UP THE GUARD AND COME AROUND. ATHLETIC AS HECK. HE GETS A NICE BLOCK. AND EDDIE MAKE SIMMONS, MISSES. THIS IS WHAT TAMPA BAY FANS HAVE BEEN WAITING TO SEE OUT OF WHITE. AL: HELMET TO HELMET. FROM THE 15. THE TOSS. NICE MOVE. TO THE 5 GOES BUCKY IRVING. HE IS TAKEN DOWN WILLIAMS. KIRK: LOOK AT THE PIECES. IT IS NOT JUST MY GAVIN OR CHRIS BODDEN -- CHRIS GODWIN. THEY HAVE PIECES AND THEN THROW BAKER MAYFIELD INTO THE MIX AND WHAT HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE THE BALL AND NOT LOCK INTO JUST ONE GUY. IT IS A LOT TO DEAL WITH IN THIS LEAGUE: OFFENSIVE -- LIAM COHEN 'S OFFENSIVE STRATEGY THIS YEAR. AL: A HARD TO HIT THEIR IRVING FROM GETTING INTO THE END ZONE. THIS TEAM HAS A TON OF TALENT. A GOOD VETERAN MIX WITH A LOT OF GOOD YOUNG PLAYERS WITH BAKER MAYFIELD P HIS GAME NOW. KIRK: AND I THINK BAKER MAYFIELD, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE FUN WITH THE MIKE TYSON END THE HEADBUTTING IN CAROLINA BUT I THINK HE IS A DEFERENT -- DIFFERENT GUY FROM THE ONE IN L.A. NOW HE HAS BECOME MORE OF A VETERAN THAT THEY COUNT ON FOR LEADERSHIP AND GUIDANCE. AL: FROM THE 2. DID HE GET IN? HE CANNOT. IRVING IS STUFFED AT THE 1 A SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. JUST OVER THREE MINUTES TO PLAY. KIRK: THIS DEFENSIVE LINE, THEY DON'T HAVE THE GAME WRECKERS UPFRONT. THAT IS WHY IT IS TOUGH TO RUN THE INTERIOR WITH THE FRONT THREE THEY HAVE WITH THEIR SIZE. AL: SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. KIRK: BAKER IS ALWAYS A THREAT. HE CAN RUN THE BALL HIMSELF. WHITE GETS TACKLED AT THE 4-YARD LINE BY CLARK PHILLIPS. THAT SAVES A TOUCHDOWN. THIRD AND GOAL. PHILLIPS DOES A NICE JOB COMING OFF OF GODWIN. HE WAS OUT THERE GIVES UP ON GODWIN. GREAT AWARENESS THAT TIME NOT TO BE LURED INTO THE INSIDE. THOSE THREE RECEIVERS WERE STACKED UP TO THE OUTSIDE. THEY ALL WENT TO THE INSIDE. WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY FOR PHILLIPS TO FOLLOW THEM. INSTEAD, EYES ON BAKER MAYFIELD COMES OFF OF HE'S IN GREAT POSITION TO MAKE THAT TACKLE. AL: TO THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING ON "THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL." TAMPA BAY 17, ATLANTA 17.WHILE, BIG PLAY HERE, THIRD DOWN AND GOAL. FROM THE 3-YARD LINE. RUNNING BACK IS WHITE. SPLIT LEFT. GODWIN TO THE RIGHT. THROWS TO THE CORNER, THAT'S CAUGHT. STERLING SHEPHERD COMES UP WITH IT. SO THE TWO GUYS WHO CONNECTED IN OKLAHOMA YEARS AGO, SHEPHERD OFF THE PRACTICE SQUAD, A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. PULLS IT IN FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. TAMPA BAY TAKES THE LEAD AGAIN. KIRK: WOW, WAS THAT A TROPE? TALK ABOUT THE CHEMISTRY GOING BACK TO 2015 IN NORMAN, OKLAHOMA. HE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE HE WANTED TO GO WITH THIS A DRAKE ROUTE BY SHEPHERD, PUTS RIGHT ON THE MONEY. WASN'T BAD COVERAGE AT ALL. HAMILTON PRETTY CLOSE IN COVERAGE. HE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH ROOM TO GET THAT IN THERE. BUT HE SOMEHOW THREADED THE NEEDLE. LIP MCLAUGHLIN TACKS ON ANOTHER ONE. KIRK: HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE HE WANTS TO GO, BACK TO THAT CORNER. BEFORE HE RELEASES THE BALL, LOOK THAIT COVERAGE HERE. THAT'S PRETTY TIGHT. LOOK WHERE HE PUTS THE BALL. THAT'S AN OUTSTANDING THROW BY BAKER YOU SEE SHEPHERD WORK INSIDE, KIND OF HESITATE. PICKS UP, SWITCH OF COVERAGE, THEN GETS AWAY FROM HAMILTON THERE WITH AN OUTSTANDING THROW. AGAIN, THAT'S A GREAT LOOK AT IT RIGHT THERE. HE COULD NOT HAVE HANDED THAT FOOTBALL ANY BETTER TEAMMATE. AL: WE'VE HAD A FEW BLOWOUTS ON THURSDAY NIGHT BUT THIS IS A BEAUTY SO FAR. KIRK: THIS IS GREAT. WHAT A WAY TO START THE WEEKEND IN FOOTBALL. AL: WEEK FIVE, FIRST GAME OF OCTOBER. COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, SHEPHERD THOUGHT HIS CAREER WAS OVER. MAYFIELD AS HAPPY AS HE'S EVER BEEN. HE INDICATED THAT THE OTHER DAY IN OUR ZOOM CALL. KICKOFF HERE WILL GO THROUGH THE END ZONE FOR KIRK: BAKER HAS BEEN ON FIRE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB. HE'S 12-15. WHAT I LIKE IS TALKING ABOUT HIM BEING DECISIVE LAST WEEK AGAINST PHILLY. DIELG UP PLAY, GETTING HIM A CHANCE TO GET THE BALL, AND HE'S MIXING IT IT'S MIKE EVANS, CHRIS GODWIN, WE SAW SHEPHERD MAKE A NICE TOUCHDOWN WITH A PERFECTLY THROWN SO HE WAS IN THE ZONE A WEEK AGO AND THAT HAS CONTINUED, WHICH IS -- WHICH THEY WANT TO SEE, CONSISTENCY WEEK IN AND WEEK OUT. A GREAT FIRST HALF SO FAR FROM TAMPA. AL: COUSINS HAS BEEN AS HOT AS MAYFIELD. THAT'S OVER THE MIDDLE FOR RAYRAY MCCLOUD. KIRK: IMPORTANT MINUTE 51 FOR ATLANTA, DOWN SEVEN. THEY'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO STOP BAKER IN THIS OFFENSE. BUCS HAVE THREE TOUCHDOWN DRIVES AN A FIELD GOAL, THEY HAVE MOVED THE BALL AT WAS. AL: KEAMP WILL GET THE BALL TO START THE SECOND HALF. COUSINS FIRES. CAUGHT A LITTLE SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN. WAS HIS KNEE DOWN? THAT'S THE QUESTION. DRAKE LONDON TAKING THE CATCH. THEY GIVE HIM THE FIRST DOWN AS HE CROSSES THE 40-YARD LINE. KIRK: HECK OF AN EFFORT JUST SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN THE BALL BROUGHT HIM BACK. MIGHT BE A YARD SHORT BUT HIS KNEE DID NOT TOUCH. AL: THEY'RE GOING TO REVIEW IT. NO COACHES' CHALLENGES IN THE LAST TWO MINUTES. WAS ANYTHING HIT? DON'T SEE ANYTHING. KIRK: THAT'S CLEAN. DRAKE LONDON, 6'4", 213, HE'S TOUGH, GREAT CATCH RADIUS. BUT IT'S WHAT HE JUST SHOWED RIGHT THERE. YOU DON'T TYPICALLY SEE THAT FROM RECEIVERS WITH GREAT LENGTH. THEY DON'T HAVE THATTABLE TO FIGHT LIKE THAT. AND I THINK THAT TELLS YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HIS PERSONALITY, HIS THIRD YEAR OUT OF U.S.C. REFEREE: AFTER FURTHER REVIEW THE RULING ON THE FIELD STANDS AS CALLED. AL: SO 1:31. THE FALCONS HAVE ALL THEIR TIME-OUTS. FOUR-MAN RUSH. SAW IT ON THE -- CAUGHT ON THE OUTSIDE. GOES BACK TO LONDON. TACKLE THERE BY SMITH. KIRK: COUSINS IS A VETERAN WHO HAS BEEN IN THESE SITUATIONS MANY, MANY TIMES IN HIS PASS THROWN BEHIND. MAKING THE MOST OF IT, MAKING THE CATCH IS ROBINSON. GOT AWAY FROM DAVIDS WITH EXACTLY 60 SECONDS. FIRST DOWN ON THE BUCCANEER'S SIDE OF THE FIELD. KIRK: THAT'S SOMETHING HE MAY MISS, MORE IMPORTANTLY HE PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN AND CROSSES MIDFIELD. YOU THINK DAVID WILL MAKE THE TACKLE BUT ROBINSON PRIDES HIMSELF ON THE FIRST GUY MISSING. THAT TIME HE SHOWED QUICKNESS AND POWER TO GET OUT OF THAT. AL: DAVIDS HAS ONLY MADE 150RBGZ 0 TACKLES IN HIS CAREER BUT NOT THERE. OPEN TO THE 39-YARD LINE RAY-RAY MCCLOUD, SECOND DUNN AND 2. KIRK: GOOD DECISION QUICK BY COUSINS. CHECK IT DUNN. TAKE THE POSITIVE AL: KEEP IT ROLLING. NO HUDDLE TO THE PASS IS CAUGHT. LONDON. CONTINUES HIS BIG THAT'LL STOP THE CLOCK WITH 34 SECONDS. LONDON IS 6-64 YARDS. COUSINS IS ON A 500-YARD PACE. KIRK: WHEN KIRK COUSINS SIGN WITH ATLANTA, EVERYBODY WAS PICTURING WHAT HE COULD BE FOR THIS OFFENSE. IN THE FIRST COUPLE OF GAMES WE'VE SEEN INCONSISTENCIES BUT TONIGHT WE'RE SEEING THE KIRK COUSINS WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT SEE. AL: FIRED OVER THE MIDDLE, TIPPED, INCOMPLETE. TRYING TO GET THAT ONE TO LONDON. WHITEHEAD WAS THERE TO BREAK UP THE PLAY. KIRK: THESE SAFETIES HAVE BEEN DROPPING ON THIS DRIVE. THIS TIME THE VETERAN, WHITEHEAD, DOES A GOOD JOB SINKING, COMING UNDERNEATH. I THINK HE SURPRISED COUSINS BY COMING DUNN INSTEAD OF DROPPING BACK ON THE HASH. HE CAME DOWN. AND ALMOST MADE A PLAY AL: SECOND AND 10. PRACTICING THE HOLD. LOOK OUT. BIG, BIG SACK. LOGAN HALL GETS IN NUMBER 90. THAT'LL BE A TIME-OUT TAKEN HERE, THEIR FIRST. THEY STILL HAVE TWO. THIRD AND 18 FORTHCOMING. KIRK: 76, MCCARRY, IS -- MCGARY IS PUSHING THRU AN INJURY. SEE THAT KNEE BANDAGED UP THERE. PEOPLE WAITING FOR HIM TO HAVE A BREAKOUT GAME, A SECOND ROUND PICK A FEW YEARS AGO. AS THE LENGTH AND QUICKNESS. THAT TIME GETS INSIDE OF MCGARY AND PICKS UP THAT SACK. A GREAT TIME FOR THIS TAMPA DEFENSE. AL: PLAYED HIS COLLEGE BALL IN HOUSTON. HE WAS THE FIRST PICK OF THE SECOND ROUND THAT THIRD DOWN AND 18 NOW. GOOD PROTECTION THIS TIME THAT. PASS IS OUT OF RANGE. FOR DARNELL MOONEY. YOU'VE GOT FOURTH DOWN. YOU'VE GOT A 56-YARD KIRK: GIVE IT A SHOT. -- A SHOT. AL: THESE DAYS. KIRK: IT'S AMAZING. THEY WERE MOVING THE THEN THIS INCOMPLETION WITH WHITEHEAD COMES UP WITH THAT BRACKET COVERAGE, THE SACK, THEN THEY LOSE ALL THEIR MOMENTUM ON THIS DRIVE. AL: MEANWHILE THEY'RE GOING TO BRING, THEY'RE GOING TO SEND PINION IN NOW TO PUNT. FIRST PUNT OF THE GAME. CAMERON JOHNSON BACK TO RECEIVE. MADE AT THE 4-YARD KIRK: SHOWS THE RESPECT THEY HAVE FOR BAKER IF THEY MISS AL: WHILE WE WERE IN COMMERCIAL, THE FALCONS WERE LEAVING THE FIELD. REFEREE: 12 SECONDS THEN GAME CLOCK. THE CLOCK WILL START ON AL: IT WENT TO ZERO, THEY THOUGHT THE HALF WAS OVER. THEY WERE LIKE, THE HALF IS NOT OVER, COME ON KIRK: I DON'T THINK THEY OFFICIALLY SET THE REFEREE: 25 SECONDS ON THE PLAY CLOCK. AL: SO THEY'LL HAVE A 96-YARD TOUCHDOWN PASS. OR WON'T. KIRK: ARE WE GOOD HERE? AL: CLOCK RUNNING DOWN. ATLANTA COULD TAKE A TIME-OUT. FINALLY. KIRK: THERE WE GO, BOYS. AL: FINALLY AND OFFICIALLY. BUCCANEERS GET THE SECOND HALF KICKOFF. BUCCANEERS TRYING TO GO TO 4-1. ATLANTA TRYING TO AVOID GOING UNDER .500. COUSINS CHECKING UP, WHAT'S GOING ON? AND WE WILL GO DOWN TO KAYLEE. KAYLEE: I KNOW THAT LAST DRIVE DIDN'T END THE WAY YOU WANED IT TOO BUT OTHERWISE WHAT ENABLED YOUR AFNS TO TAKE OFF? >> THE OFFENSE HAS BEEN GOING, THEY'VE BEEN IMPROVING EVERY WEEK, SO NOT A SURPRISE TO ME. THEY ARE EXPLOSIVE, THEIR OFFENSE IS GOING, WE GOT TO COME OUT AND FIGHT OUR BUTTS OFF IN THE SECOND HALF. KAYLEE: THANKS, COACH. AL: COMING UP AFTER THE BREAK THE STATE THIS OFFENSE OUT OF RHYTHM? THE BIGGEST THING THEY CAN DO, ROLL COVERAGE UP, TRY TO GET HIM TO HOLD THE BALL INSTEAD OF ALLOWING EASY ACCESS THROWS WHERE HE'S GETTING IT OUT PRETTY QUICKLY. AL: HE'S GOOD PROTECTION HE'S GOING TO GET THE MEANWHILE FROM A YARD INTO THE END ZONE, BUCKY IRVING IS STILL ON HIS SPEEDOUT PASS AT 35. MOMENTS AGO KAYLEE WAS WITH TODD BOLZ. KAYLEE: THE FALCON'S OFFENSE HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE THROUGH THE AIR. HOW DO YOU ADJUST TO STOP THAT? >> GOT TO PLAY BETTER UNDERNEATH COVERAGE AND TACKLE BETTER. WE'LL MAKE ADJUSTMENTS THIS HALF, WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO TACKLE. GUYS HAVE TO SETTLE DOWN, WE HAVE TO PLAY OUR KIND OF FOOTBALL. KAYLEE: WHAT DO YOU EXPOSE IN THE FALL KEENS DEFENSE? >> WE OPENED UP SOME THINGS IN THE PASSING GAME AND BAKER HAS BEEN SHARP. AL: BAKER HAS BEEN THREE T.D.'S. FAKE TO THE OUTSIDE. GET THE BALL OFF TO RASHARD AT THE END OF THE LONG RUN AT THE END OF THE FIRST HALF. KIRK: THERE'S JARRETT, HE LOOKS LIKE HE GOT HIS HANDS ON IT THERE. THEY SAY THAT'S ATLANTA'S BALL. AL: HE SAID BALL COMING OUT AFTER CONTACT WITH THE GROUND. KIRK: THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN EXCITED TO SEE COME BACK TO HIS GAME THAT. QUICKNESS HE HAS, THE ABILITY TO USE HIS HANDS AND GET AWAY FROM THE OFFENSIVE LINEMEN COMING OFF THAT A.C.L. WEEK EIGHT LAST YEAR AGAINST TENNESSEE. INTO THAT BACKFIELD. AND SAID HE'S DOWN. BUT JUST GOOD QUICKNESS THAT TIME. AL: CLOSE BUT NO CHALLENGE. SECOND DOWN AND 8. FLUSHED OUT. THROWS. FLAG IS DOWN. BALL UP AT THE 46-YARD LINE ON THAT CATCH BY GODWIN. BUT -- KIRK: GOT IN THERE AND HELD HIM. JUDON KNEW RIGHT AWAY. LIKE CAN I GET SOME HELP HERE? OFFENSE NUMBER 77. AL: TOOK HIM TO SCHOOL. NEVER MIND. KIRK: BULL RUSH HERE WITH THE WIG MAN, NINTH FORMER PATRIOT. USING THAT POWER. WATCH HIM LOOK OVER HIS SHOULDER LIKE, CAN I GET SOME HELP? HE GOT THE CALL. EVANS ON THE SIDELINE. AL: CLUTCHING THE LEFT ARM FOR AT LEAST THIS WHITE MIGHT HAVE HAD ROOM TO ROAM. INSTEAD SLIPS DOWN. WHITE TAKEN DOWN. LOSS OF TWO ON THE COMES BACK IN. THIRD DOWN AND 20. AL: PRETTY GOOD CATCH BY -- KIRK: PRETTY GOOD CATCH BY BAKER. TRYING TO SET UP THE SCREEN, THAT CAN MESS UP THE TIMING WHILE THAT DEFENSE, THEY SAW RIGHT GOOD JOB BY THE ATLANTA FINALLY GETTING THIS OFFENSE WAY BEHIND THE STICKS AFTER THAT AND THEN RALLYING THERE ON THAT SCREEN. AL: THIRD DOWN AND 20. HAVE TO GET TO THE 47. MAYFIELD LOOKING LATERAL FOR A MOMENT. GETS BANGED OUT OF BOUNDS. IS THERE A FLAG AT THE END OF THAT PLAY? THERE IS. THAT'S ANTONIO HAMILTON. KIRK: YOU TALK ABOUT A MENTAL ERROR. I MEAN, YOU FINALLY GET PRESSURE. THEIR FIRST PRESSURE OF LET UP. EVEN IF IT'S A GRAY AREA, GOT TO LET UP. AL: THEY HAD 24 YARDS TO GO. KIRK: TO ME IT'S GREAT THEY WAVED IT OFF. YOU COULD SEE HE WAS JUST STARTING TO GO OUT OF BOUNDS. IT'S GREAT. BUT ON THIRD AND FOREVER WHAT'S THE POINT? WHAT'S THE POINT IN HITTING HIM RIGHT HERE? GREAT THAT THE OFFICIALS WERE ABLE TO CONVERSE AND ABLE TO GET THIS, MAKE THIS THE RIGHT BUT 33 HAMILTON JUST CAUGHT A HUGE BREAK. AL: TRENTON GILL WILL PUNT. JAKE HAS BEEN THEIR PUNTER BUT HE'S BEEN STRUGGLING SO THEY BRING GILL IN. WHO HAS BEEN KICKING OFF TONIGHT AND HE'LL PUNT HERE. BUCCANEER'S FIRST PUNT WILLIAMS BACK TO RECEIVE THAT STORM ROARED UP THROUGH TAMPA AND DEZ MATED WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA. DONATE IF YOU CAN. BACK TO MERCEDES-BENZ STADIUM. ATLANTA AT THE 20-YARD THEY START THIS DRIVE. PLAY FAKE. THROWING. ALMOST PICKED. GOOD COVERAGE THAT TIME. DEAN WITH THE PLAY ON MOONEY. KIRK: SECONDTIME HE'S GONE BACK SHOULDER. DEAN LOOKS BACK, LOCATES THE BALL, THERE'S SOME CONTACT THERE. BUT NO FOUL. AL: BACK TO A SECOND. THE LONGTIME OWNER OF THE ATLANTA FALCONS WATCHING HIS MAN COUSINS GO DEEP DOWNFIELD. GOING TO BE CAUGHT AT THE 50-YARD LINE. HAULED IN BY DRAKE HIS HUGE NIGHT CONTINUING. COUSINS UNDER PRESSURE THAT'S A GAIN OF 31. KIRK IS NOW 284 THROUGH THE AIR. AL: HOW ABOUT DAVONTAE DAVID HERE. HE'LL INITIALLY RUN AND THEN GIVE LONDON OFF TO WHITEHEAD. WHEN WHITEHEAD COMES OVER TO TRY HELP OUT THERE'S NO CHANCE OF HIM LOCATING THE FOOTBALL. AT THAT TIME HE PLACED IT PERFECTLY TO LONDON. AL: TOSSBACK HERE FROM THE 49-YARD LINE. TO THE 44-YARD LINE GOES TYLER ALGEAR. KAYLEE: HE'S DIVISION RIVALS ARE UNITED IN THEIR COMMITMENT TO HELPING THOSE DEAF TATED BY HURRICANE HELENE. KIRK COUSINS AND BAKER MAYFIELD ARE DONATED A COMBINED $100,000 TO THE RELIEF EFFORTS ORGANIZED BY TEAM RUBICON. THAT'S IN ADDITION TO CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE FALCONS' ARTHUR BLANK FAMILY FOUNDATION WHICH GAVE $500,000 TO THIS ORGANIZATION AND $2 MILLION TO THE WORLD CENTRAL KITCHEN. THE BUCKS BLAZER FAMILY DONATED $2 MILLION TO NONPROFITS HELPING THE VICTIM. AL: AND DAVID AND NICOLE TEPOR OF THE PANTHERS WITH A $3 MILLION DONATION. YOU'VE GOT LA DAVID IS DOWN. HE'S BEEN THE IRON MAN. 13 YEARS IN THE LEAGUE. A GUY WHO PLAYED ALMOST EVERY SNAP LAST WEEK. THE HEAT INDEX WAS LIKE 108 IN TEARP. KIRK: THE RIGHT GUARD, CHRIS LID IS STROM, GOT UP THERE AND MADE THAT BLOCK. WE TALKED ABOUT, HOW DO YOU PLAY THAT MANY SNAPS WITH THAT KIND OF HEAT? HE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE WAS CONSTANTLY WORKING TO TRY TO GET HIMSELF USED TO THAT WEATHER YEAR-AROUND. NO ONE CAN GET USED TO AL: I SAID YOU MUST BE ON THE PROGRAM WITH THE GUYS IN TAMPA. SECOND AND 5. REFEREE: FALSE START, OFFENSE, NUMBER 65. FIVE-YARD PENALTY. AL: MATTHEW BERGERON, THE LEFT GUARD. KIRK: KEEP IN MIND ON THIS DEFENSE, NOT ONLY IS ANTOINE WINFIELD JR., YOU SEE LA VONTAE DAVID, K.J. BRITT IN THE MIDDLE, J.J. RUSSELL, IT'S BEEN A REAL CONCERN, THE MIDDLE OF THE DEFENSE IS WHERE COUSINS HAS DONE A LOT OF DAMAGE. AL: RUSSELL IN FOR DAVID. HE'S NUMBER 51. SECOND DOWN AND10. EXTRA MAN COMES. COUSINS FIRES IN THE OFFSIDE. NEARLY PICKED THERE. AND THAT TIME IT WAS MCCOLLUM ALMOST HAD THE PICK. MOONEY TURNING INTO PRETTY MUCH THE DEFENSIVE BACK INSTEAD OF THE RECEIVER ON THAT KIRK: HE'S SITTING THERE WAITING FOR THIS. I HEAR HE DOES -- RIGHT HERE HE DOES A GOOD JOB PUSHING THE BIG LEFT TACKLE, JAKE MATTHEWS, INTO THE QUARTERBACK. HURRY UP AGAIN HERE THIRD DOWN. AL: THIRD AND 10. SHORT OF THE FIRST THEY'RE AT THE 43-YARD SEVEN-POINT GAME. EARLY THIRD. LINING UP TO GO FOR IT ON A FOURTH DOWN AND 3. AWAY THEY GO. BIG THROW. THE PASS, OPEN, CAUGHT, 30-YARD LINE, SPINNING AROUND, THROWN OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 28 YIRLD IS MOONEY. FOURTH DOWN AND 3, A GAIN OF 14. KIRK: YOU KNOW ON FOURTH DOWN, THIS OFFENSIVE LINE, THERE'S NO BLITZ. THERE'S FOUR GUYS ABLE TO COME HERE. WATCH THE OFFENSIVE THEY'RE HOLDING ON. THE DEFENSE IS DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO AFFECT COUSINS. THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HIT HIM BUT THEY AFFECT HE'S FALLING OFF THAT THROW. STILL HAS ENOUGH ON IT TO GET THAT BALL THROWN TO MOONEY. LOOKS RIGHT. COMES BACK. DOESN'T WANT TO COME BACK ON THAT FOURTH DOWN DOESN'T HAVE A LOT ON IT BUT ENOUGH TO GET IT OUT AL: COUSINS HAS THROWN FOR 300 YARDS. BACKWARD PASS. MOONEY STOPPED OFF A MINIMAL GAIN. KIRK: I LOVE HOW ZACH ROBINSON AND KIRK COUSINS ARE MIXING UP THE TEMPO. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS HE TALKED ABOUT, I SAID WITH SEAN MCVAY BEING A QUARTERBACK COACH FOR SO MANY YEAR HE TALKED ABOUT KEEPING THEM ON THEIR HEELS. GOING UP AGAINST AN THAT'S ONE THING YOU HAVE TO DO. ESPECIALLY ON THIRD AND LONG, SECOND AND LONG. TRYING TO GO FAST TEMPOS, NOT ALLOW THEM TO DEGREE THEIR CLEATS IN AND COME AFTER YOU. AL: SECOND AND 8 PRESSURE AGAIN. SHOULD BE A FIRST DOWN. HE HAD NO CATCHES. LAST WEEK. TONIGHT VERY MUCH A PART OF THE PROCESS. FIVE GRABS FOR 74 PRESSURE PUT ON THAT TIME BY WHITEHEAD. KIRK: DOUBLE-A MUG LOOK. BRING THE SAFETY ON TOP OF THAT. NOT ENOUGH GUYS TO BE ABLE TO PICK HIM UP. GREAT JOB FEELING THAT. KNOWING THE CLOCK IS TICKING. BARELY GETS THE SECOND HITCH OFF. LOOK AT THE ACCURACY TONIGHT BY 18. HE'S THROWING THE BALL SO WELL. AL: FROM THE 18. START HERE. A NICE TACKLE. A FLAG. WE'LL HEAR FROM RON TORVOR IN A MOMENT. KIRK: FIVE BLACK ON A HOLD. AL: YEAH. IT'S LONDON. KIRK: KIND OF A REPEATING THEME FOR THIS MOVE, MOVE, MOVE, AND THEN PENALTIES AND SELF-DESTRUCTING. REFEREE: TWO FOULS DURING PLAY. BOTH BY THE OFFENSE. INELIGIBLE PLAYER ILLEGALLY DOWNFIELD, NUMBER 70. PENALTY DECLINED. PASS INTERFERENCE. NUMBER 12. THAT PENALTY WILL BE ACCEPTED. 10-YARD PENALTY. EXCUSE ME. AL: YOU'RE RIGHT. FINISHING -- LAST YEAR, THIS TEAM WAS 29TH IN THE RED ZONE. KIRK: YEAH. THAT'S HUGE PROBLEM FOR THEM THESE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. YOU COULD SEE HODGE WITH THE INTERFERENCE. SAW THE HOLD BY LONDON. RED ZONE THIS YEAR. YOU MENTIONED 29TH LAST 29TH THIS YEAR. HAD THEIR OPPORTUNITIES, SEE IF THEY CAN FINISH THE DRIVE OFF AFTER A MISCUE. AL: FIRST AND 20 FROM THE 28-YARD LINE. TO THE 22 GOES BIJOHN RONSON. HIS EIGHTH CARRY OF THE ONLY 24 YARDS. THREE YARDS PER TOTE. FALCONS HAVE RUSHED ONLY 10 TIMES TONIGHT. THROWN 38. SECOND AND 14. GOT HIM BY THE SHIRT COLLAR. DOWN HE GOES. ANTHONY NELSON WILL GET THAT SACK. NELSON MAKING HIS FIRST BIG PLAY OF THE NIGHT TO MAKE IT THIRD DOWN AND 22. KIRK: HE HAS TREMENDOUS LENGTH, GOOD EFFORT. IT'S THE COVERAGE DOWNFIELD THAT ALLOWS HIM TO GET HOME. THE DOUBLE MOVE BY HIS EYES ON THAT QUARTERBACK. THERE'S NO CHANCE THAT HE'S GOING TO FALL FOR YOU CAN SEE THAT STUTTER AND GO. HE'S RIGHT THERE. THAT'S WHY COUSINS JUST ATE IT. AL: BACKED UP AGAIN. THIRD AND 22. REACHING DOWN, TRIED TO GET IT TO DARNELL MOONEY. THROW IS LOW. FOURTH AND 22. IN COMES THE FIELD GOAL UNIT. KIRK: WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT LAST YEAR BEFORE THE ACHILLES AND THEN AFTER THIS YEAR COMING BACK 11 MONTHS. COUSINS JUST SOMETIMES DOESN'T QUITE -- THAT BALL COULD HAVE BEEN SOMETIMES WE CAN'T QUITE DRIVE OFF THAT BACK THE BALL TENDS TO DROP ON HIM NEAR THE END. IT DID THAT TIME. MOONEY COULD HAVE MADE THE CATCH BUT THE BALL DOWN LOW. AL: ILLUSTRATED THAT PERFECTLY BEFORE. TRYING TO PLANT THAT BACK FOOT. KOO. IS GOOD. 6:21 TO PLAY IN THE THIRD QUARTER. LOOK AT THE LAST PASS WHICH WAS DROPPED, 24-20. LUDACRIS ON HAND SWINGING AND ROCKING TO THE MUSIC. WHATEVER. AND THE KICKOFF HERE. INTO THE END ZONE. TIME NOW FOR TONIGHT'S JOURNEY, IT'S BROUGHT TO YOU BY HYUNDAI. YOU'VE GOT KIRK COUSINS, TREMENDOUS NIGHT. 315 YARDS, TWO TOUCHDOWNS. BAKER MAYFIELD. THREE TOUCHDOWN PASSES MIKE EVANS. 4-49. TWO T.D.'S. 100 NOW FOR HIS SPECTACULAR CAREER. THE TWO HEAD COACHES, WELL-ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER THROUGH THE YEARS. THE BALL IS OUT. DOES HE GET IT? DOES HE SAVE THE DAY? HE DOES. GODWIN HAD IT PUNCHED OUT THAT TIME BY BATES. EVANS IS RIGHT THERE. KIRK: BALL GOES OUT. ANYBODY'S FOOTBALL. BOY DID THAT PLAY OPEN UP A LITTLE PLAY ACTION MOVE TO THE RIGHT. LINEBACKERS FLOWED. FOR BAKER. AL: A GAIN OF 21. THE BALL INTO FALCON TERRITORY. ON THE MOVE. CAUGHT TO THE 40-YARD CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN GOES GODWIN. AL: LET'S LOOK AT OUR -- KIRK: LET'S LOOK AT OUR NEXT GENERAL STATS POWERED BY AWS. ATLANTA IS NOT BLITZ. THE PROBLEM IS THEY UP BLITZES. THESE LAST FOUR YEARS THEY HAVE REALLY STRUGGLED. THINK ABOUT THE LAST GREAT PASS RUSHER, WE WERE TALKING, VIC BEASLEY, JOHN ABRAHAM, WHO HAVE THEY REALLY HAD? A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED WHEN THEY DIDN'T PICK ONE THIS WENT WITH PENIX WHO I THINK WILL BE A GREAT AL: THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY, WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT WHEN THEY HAVE THE BALL. STOP AT THE LINE OF KIRK: JIMMY LAKE WHO HAS BEEN AROUND THE NFL AND COLLEGE. I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING. DEFENSIVE GUY. LAST YEAR GOES AND WORKS WITH THE RAMS AND WAS WORKING ON THE OFFENSIVE SIDE. HE'S IN THE MEETINGS WITH MATTHEW STAFFORD AND SEAN AND S SEAN MCVAY. AS A DEFENSIVE COACH HE'S HELPING THEM. NOW HE GETS A CHANCE TO BE A DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR AFTER THAT EXPERIENCE HE UNDERSTANDS OFFENSES THAT MUCH BETTER. AL: MAYFIELD ESCAPES, HE'S GOING TO RUN, BANG HIS WAY CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN TO THE 29-YARD GOT A SPOT AT THE 29. SEE IF THEY GIVE HIM THE FIRST OR NOT. ARE THEY -- WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO PUT IT? KIRK: THEY'RE GOING FASTER ON THIRD DOWN AND SHORT TO GET PRESSURE ON GRAHAM. AL: INSTEAD, SWEEP IT TO THE OUTSIDE AND GO TO FLAG IS THROWN AT THE END OF THAT PLAY. BERTRAND WAS THERE. HE LOOKS UP AT THE BOARD WHICH IS A MILE HIGH HERE IN ATLANTA. NEED NECK SURGERY AFTER LOOKING AT THIS THING. KIRK: HOW ABOUT GODWIN. HE THROWS SHEPHERD HE'S DOARMD GET THE REFEREE: AFTER THE PLAY WAS OVER, PERSONAL FOUL. UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS. NUMBER 40. KIRK: I'M NOT SURE SHEPHERD DIDN'T TAKE THE WORST OF THAT. HE GOT DRILLED BY HIS FELLOW RECEIVER. FIRST DUNN AND THEN 15 ON TOP OF IT. AL: FRIENDLY FIRE. BERTRAND IS BACK PLAYING TONIGHT IN PLACE OF TROY ANDERSON WHO HAD THAT SPECTACULAR GAME ON SUNDAY. KIRK: DON'T OVERLOOK THAT THIRD DOWN SCRAMBLE BY BAKER MAYFIELD, THAT SCRAMBLE TO GET HIM TO THIRD AND SHORT. THAT'S X FACTOR THAT BAKER BRINGS. THEY DON'T WANT HIM TO ALWAYS RELY ON THAT. BUT HERE AND THERE, WHEN HE REALLY OPENS UP, YOU TAKE IT WHICH HE DID. ON THAT OCCASION. AL: 3:40 TO GO IN THE FIRST DOWN AT THE 14. STOPPED AT THE LINE OF IRVING TAKEN DOWN THERE BY JARRETT. KIRK: WHAT A PLAY BY JARRETT. GETS AROUND BARTON TO CENTER. WATCH THE CENTER TRYING TO COME BACK AND PICK UP THAT BLOCK. BUT THAT IS A TOUGH ASSIGNMENT FOR A ROOKIE FOR ANY CENTER. OUTSIDE SHADE. THEN JUST TRYING TO GET BACK TO HIM. SUCH A QUICK FIRST STEP. HE'S IN THE BACKFIELD BEFORE BARTON CAN EVEN TURN TO TRY TO GET HIM BLOCKED. SEAL HIM OFF, CHASING THAT PLAY. AL: BARTON PLAYED AT DUKE, 26TH OVERALL. OVER THE MIDDLE THAT. THAT'S TAUGHT. COUPLE OF YARDS SHY OF THE FIRST. BERTRAND MAKING THIS -- MAKES THE TACKLE. THIRD AND 2. KIRK: PART OF ATLANTA'S DEFENSIVE SCHEME THAT THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH WITH JIMMY LAKE AND MORRIS IS YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP THINGS IN FRONT OF YOU. LIKE A LOT OF DEFENSES IN THE NFL THESE DAYS. THEN YOU GET TEAM INTO THE RED ZONE AND YOU SQUEEZE THEM. TRY TO GET THEM TO FORCE THE FIELD GOALS. DON'T GIVE UP HERE'S A CHANCE ON THIRD AL: WHITE. BREAKS DOWN, SACKED AT THE 15-YARD LINE. MAYFIELD IS SHAKING HIS LEG AS HE GETS UP. KIRK: THEY WALKED UP FIVE, SIX GUYS. THEN END UP RUSHING THREE AND DROPPING EIGHT. JUST TRYING TO CONFUSE THE OFFENSIVE LINE. AND IT'S A HECK OF A BAKER MAYFIELD, I THINK, ANTICIPATING SOME THEY END UP THROWING HIM A CURVEBALL THERE BY DROPPING IN COVERAGE. AL: HE GETS TWISTED AS WELL. MCLAUGHLIN. 32-YARD FIELD GOAL EASY PICKINGS. WITH ONE 1:17 REMAINING IN THE THIRD, BAKER TAKES A SEAT ON THE BENCH. THEY'LL LOOK AT HIM. 27-20.IN 1976. SERVED THROUGH JANUARY OF 1981. WHAT A LIFE THAT MAN HAS LIVED. INCREDIBLE WHAT HE'S DONE OVER THE LAST 44 YEARS. BUILDING HOMES. A LIFE WELL LIVED. WELL LIVED. TAMPA BAY ON TOP. THE FALCONS START AT THE 30 YARD ATLANTA PLAYING THESE VERY CLOSE GAMES. AGAIN, 01 POSITION GAME. YOU CAN'T MAKE TOO MUCH OF AN EARLY-SEASON GAME. BUT EITHER ATLANTA COULD TIE TAMPA BAY AT THE TOP OR THEY WILL BE TWO GAMES BACK AFTER FIVE WEEKS. KIRK: THEY PLAY IN FIVE WEEKS ANYTIME YOU GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY A DIVISION RIVAL, YOU WANT TO TAKE A STEP FORWARD BECAUSE IT MATTERS SO MUCH WHEN YOU GET TO THE END. YOU CAN FEEL THAT. YOU CAN FEEL THE INTENSITY. THE WEIGHT EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT A SHORT WEEK AND THE DEFENSE HAVING AN ADVANTAGE. TONIGHT, WE'VE SEEN TWO QUARTERBACKS THAT HAVE PLAYED BOTH INCREDIBLY WELL PREPARED. DOING A GREAT JOB WITH ATTACKING THE DEFENSE. CHARISSA: THIS WILL FLARE OUT. MOONEY, SHORT. DOWN TO KAYLEE. >> YOU SAW BAKER MAYFIELD HOBBLING ON HIS RIGHT KNEE. SINCE THEN HE'S BEEN BACK ON THE HE HAS HAD HIS HEAD IN THE IPAD. HE JUST STOOD UP FOR THE FIRST HE WAVED OFF ANY MEDICAL ATTENTION. TAKING A FEW STEPS RIGHT NOW. IT DOESN'T LOOK AS SERIOUS AS IT LOOKED LIKE IT COULD HAVE BEEN WHEN HE FIRST GOT HIT. AL: SURE. THE BACKUP QUARTERBACK WILL BE KYLE TRASK. FAKE AND THE PASS INCOMPLETE. WELL CONTESTED. THIRD DOWN AND 8. KIRK: THE EMPHASIS ON THE HIT DROP TACKLE THIS YEAR. THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T SEE A PENALTY COMING IN ON THE TACKLE BY THE FALCONS DEFENSE. WE'VE GOT A THIRD DOWN. COUSINS WHEN HE'S HAD TIME HAS BEEN ABLE TO WORK THROUGH HIS PROGRESSIONS AND FIND AN OPEN TARGET. GREAT TARGET TONIGHT. GREAT TO SEE HE'S OFF TO THE LEFT. THREE BY ONE BY HIMSELF. AL: HE'S CAUGHT FIVE SIX TARGETS. STRAIGHT OVER THE MIDDLE. IT WILL HIT THE LARD LINE. RAY-RAY MCCLOUD. BIG FIRST DOWN ON THE CONVERSION. KIRK: BECAUSE OF THAT FORMATION, WATCH HOW QUICKLY LAMONTE DAVID CLEARS OUT. WATCH KIRK COUSINS ANTICIPATE THIS THROW. RIGHT THERE, WIDE-OPEN, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DEFENSE FROM TAMPA BAY. COUSINS HAS REALLY FELT THE RHYTHM, THE TIMING SO MUCH BETTER TONIGHT THEN HE HAS AT ANY POINT THIS YEAR. AL: WANING SECONDS OF THE BIG PULL, LEFT SIDE. BREAKING THE TACKLE. INSIDE THE 30. BE JON ROBINSON. HIS BIGGEST RUN OF THE NIGHT. THAT TAKES US TO THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER, AFTER A 29 YARD GALLUP. GOOD GAME. TAMPA BAY ON TOP BY A SCORE OF 27-20 AS WE HAD TO THE FOURTH ON THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL. SEAHAWKS NEXT THURSDAY. THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL FROM THE NORTHWEST. FIRST DOWN AT THE 18 YARD LINE. ROBINSON SPLITS THE NICE LITTLE HOLE THERE. THRUSTING FORWARD. GETS THE MOST OUT OF THAT RUN. KIRK: STARTING TO SEE THE OFFENSIVE LINE DO SOME WORK. THIS IS RIGHT BEFORE THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER. WATCH THE CENTER AND RIGHT NICE JOB GETTING UP TO THE BACKER. DOES A NICE JOB TURNING. THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT BE JON ROBINSON CAN DO HERE. FEELS THE ZONE AND BREAK THE TACKLE. HAS AN ABILITY TO BE MUCH MORE PHYSICAL THAN MOST PEOPLE REALIZE. VERY ELUSIVE BUT HE CAN GET BEHIND HIS PADS AS WELL. AL: SECOND AND 4. A LITTLE SHORT. IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 2. KIRK: IN TEXAS IN COLLEGE, HE WAS A GUY THAT RAN INSIDE ZONE AND MORE DUO. IT'S A DIFFERENT FEEL THAN THE OUTSIDE ZONES THAT THE ATLANTA FALCONS ARE RUNNING. HE'S GETTING A BETTER VISION AND PATIENTS WITH IT EVERY WEEK. AL: JORDAN WHITEHEAD SLOW TO RISE. HAD BEEN WITH TAMPA AND THEN WENT AWAY THE -- TO THE JETS DECIDED TO COME BACK TO THE BETTER WEATHER. AMONG OTHER THINGS. HE WILL HAVE TO COME OUT FOR AT LEAST ONE PLAY. THAT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 2 FOR THE FALCONS. ATLANTA THIS SEASON, 4.5 GAMES INTO THE SEASON AND THEY HAVE NEVER TRAILED OR LED BY MORE THAN ONE POSSESSION. AT ANY POINT. KIRK: FORTUNATE TO BE WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW WITH A RECORD OUT THAT'S WHERE THE POWER BACK COMES IN. DENNIS STARTING MIDDLE GOOD TO SEE HIM BACK. HE GOT HURT IN THE SECOND WEEK. A.C.L. SPRAIN. CAME BACK LAST WEEK. AL: THIRD DOWN AND 2. HE STARTS TO STUMBLE AND GETS TANGLED. THE COLUMN COMES UP TO MAKE THE NOW YOU ARE DOWN BY SEVEN. YOU'VE GOT A FOURTH DOWN AND 4. KIRK: THEY ARE GOING TO HURRY TRY TO SLOW DOWN TAMPA. AL: NO SUBSTITUTIONS. THE PASS IS CAUGHT. KIRK: GOOD JOB THERE. HAVING THE LUXURY OF A VETERAN QUARTERBACK, HURRY UP, TAKE THEM OUT OF THE AGGRESSIVE MINDSET. RAY-RAY MCCLOUD SETS THE SCREEN. MOODY GETS IN BEHIND HIM. MADE IT TOUGH ON THE DEFENDER TO STAY WITH HIM. GOOD SHAKE TO THE INSIDE PULLS AWAY FROM SMITH AND INTO THE END ZONE FOR THAT TOUCHDOWN. AL: THE EXTRA POINT IS GOOD. BEST THURSDAY NIGHT GAME OF THE SEASON. 27-27. THERE HE WAS IN THE TAMPA BAY UNIFORM. AT THAT TIME, WASHINGTON AGAINST DENVER. AFTER THE 87 CAMPAIGN. TOUCHBACK HERE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS FIRST. THEN WE WILL GET BACK TO DOUG AND A SECOND KIRK: -- IN A KIRK: SECOND. NEXGEN STATS. THE FIRST HALF, ZERO PRESSURE. THE ONLY TEAM IN THE NFL WITH ZERO PRESSURES IN THE FIRST IN THE SECOND HALF, THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO DIAL IT UP MORE. PRETTY GOOD COVERAGE DOWNFIELD. GIVING HIM A CHANCE TO GET AFTER NUMBER SIX AND TRY TO SLOW HIM BETTER JOB OF GET THAT RHYTHM. AL: THEY FILLED IN THE POCKET. FIRES OVER THE EVANS MAKING THAT GRAB THERE. TONIGHT, FIVE CATCHES. WE WERE TALKING TO TODD BOWLES. TALKING ABOUT THAT DOUG WILLIAMS GAME. 42-DAN. -- 42-10. THEY ARE SAYING HE GOT BLAMED FOR GIVING UP A TOUCHDOWN TO REGINA TEAL. IT TURNS OUT IT WAS NOT COVERAGE ON THE PLAY. KIRK: HE WANTED KNEW THAT. AL: I SAID, DON'T BLAME ME. HE SAID, IT WASN'T YOU. I CAN'T GIVE AWAY WHO IT WAS. 43 YARD LINE. MAYFIELD STEPPING UP. GOING TO RUN WITH IT. FIRST DOWN AND SEVERAL MORE. MAYFIELD SHOWING NO EFFECTS OF THE TWISTED LEG ON THE LAST HE WAS IN BEFORE THE SERIES. KIRK: WATCH W CHRIS GODWIN WHEN HE COMES INTO WORK. SAFETY THERE. NOW HE WILL TAKE A LINEBACKERS AND SAFETIES WITH HIM. THERE'S NO ONE LEFT. EVERYBODY CLEARED UP. WONDERING HOW HE MIGHT FEEL. THIS IS USUALLY THE GAME OR BAKER MAYFIELD WILL TAKE OVER. NICE THROW. NICE SCRAMBLE. FOURTH QUARTER. TIE GAME. AL: HANDS IT OFF ON FIRST DOWN BESIDES THE ONE RUN, WHITE HAS DONE BASICALLY NOTHING TO GET CAME IN WITH LESS THAN A THREE YARD AVERAGE CARRY. BUT THAT WENT WAY UP WHEN HE RAN FOR 56. KIRK: EVEN THOUGH IT'S WEEK FIVE, THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO. THESE ARE THE KIND OF GAMES, YOU FIGHT WITH 11 COLEY'S TO GO. MAKE NO MISTAKE HOW YOU CAN USE THIS AS A GAME WHERE YOU CAN REALLY RALLY TOGETHER. SO A LOT ON THE LINE FOR BOTH THESE TEAMS IN THE L 11 MINUTES. AL: OUT OF THE RANGE. KIRK: THE GUY THAT'S GETTING SOME PRESSURE HERE IN THE SECOND HALF, WE JUST SHOWED YOU THE NEXGEN STATS. YOU SEE HIM WITH THE REDS. MOST RECOGNIZABLE NAME ON THE DEFENSE AS FAR AS THE ABILITY TO GET OUT TO THE QUARTERBACK. BAKER MAYFIELD HAS BEEN WORKING INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE DEFENSE. OBVIOUS TARGET WOULD BE MIKE DEVENS. CHRIS GODWIN ON THIRD DOWN ALWAYS AN OPTION FOR HIM AS >> TIMEOUT, TAMPA BAY. AL: THE BOX WILL TAKE A TIMEOUT PRIOR TO A THIRD DOWN AND 9. WHAT'S AT STAKE AT THE MOMENT, FOR GAMES INTO THE SEASON. ALMOST A QUARTER OF THE WAY THROUGH. 17 GAME CAMPAIGN. TAMPA BAY 3-1. SAINTS AT 2-2. WE WILL SEE THEM IN A COUPLE WEEKS IN NEW ORLEANS AGAINST BRINGS SHOT -- SEAN PAYTON BACK TO THE BIG AS A -- BIG EASY. 1-3. I'M LOOKING AT MORRIS. GO BACK TO THAT WASHINGTON STAFF BACK IN 2012. COUSINS WAS THERE. SEAN MCVAY'S FIN ALL OVER THE COACHING STAFF THESE DAYS AT 38 YEARS OLD. IT'S AMAZING. KIRK: ATLANTA WAS IN THE QUARTERBACK ROOM LAST YEAR. AL: THIRD DOWN AND 9. AVOIDS THE SACK. TAKES OFF BUT IS STOPPED AT THE 34 YARD LINE. IT WILL BE FOURTH DOWN, PRAISE IT -- PRESSURED BY KADEN ELLISS WHO HAS PLAYED EVERY DEFENSIVE STAT THIS SEASON FOR THE BUCCANEERS. KIRK: THAT'S BECAUSE OF WHAT HE CAN DO ONE THIRD DOWNS. HE WILL BRING HIM OFF THE EDGE. THIS TIME HE WRITES -- GOES RIGHT THROUGH RACHAAD WHITE. THEY ARE DIALING UP THE PRESSURE AL: 53 YARD ATTEMPT. 30-27, BOX ON TOP. YOU ARE UP HERE DOING THE SWAG. KIRK: YOU ARE LUDICROUS. AL: ME AND LUDICROUS. YOU SEE THIS LIKE EVERY WEEK. SOMETHING IS GOING ON. MY FAVORITE IS THE WISCONSIN JUMP AROUND AT THE END OF THE KIRK: ALABAMA WAS CRANKED UP AL: WHAT A GAME. WHAT A GAME. PRETTY GOOD ONE HERE TONIGHT AS FALCONS AT THE 30. KIRK: KIRK COUSINS HAS HAD A GREAT GAME TONIGHT. REALLY FELT IT. TALKED ABOUT HIS TIMING BEING OFF A TONIGHT, THAT HASN'T BEEN THE CASE. EVEN WHEN HE'S BEEN PRESSURE, HE'S HAD CONFIDENCE TO BE ABLE TO TRUST LONDON. MOONEY HAS HAD A LOT OF DIFFERENT GUYS INVOLVED TONIGHT. WHAT I CATCH THERE ON THE THIS MOVEMENT AROUND HIM WITH LONDON AND MOONEY AND PITTS AND BE JOHN. THEY HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THIS ATTACK AGAINST THE BUCCANEERS PRETTY GOOD NIGHT. AL: 351 -- 3:51. UNDER PRESSURE. BACKSIDE SCREEN. MISSED THE BACKFIELD. DANA FIVE HERE FOR BE JON KIRK: JORDAN WHITEHEAD IS QUESTIONABLE RETURN BECAUSE OF THE GROIN INJURY. ANTOINE WINFIELD THIS IS NOT WHERE ANYBODY WANTS TO SEE THESE GUYS. AL: NOT AT THIS POINT. MERIWETHER COMES IN TO TAKE WHITEHEAD'S SPOT. HE'S ALSO WENT ON THE OTHER SECOND DOWN AND 5. ROBINSON GETS STUCK THERE AFTER A GAIN OF ONE. 9.5 TO GO IN REGULATION. THREE POINT GAME. RIGHT NOW, YOU'VE GOT -- WHO IS DOWN ON THE TURF. REALLY COMING INTO HIS OWN. THEY LOVE HIM. THIRD ROUND PICK OUT OF LOUISVILLE LAST YEAR. BACK AFTK. EIGHT FIELD GOALS, NO WE DID ONE OF THOSE GAMES LAST A BARNBURNER HERE TONIGHT. 30-27. THIRD DOWN AND 4. COUSINS IS BACK UNDER PRESSURE. THERE'S THE FLAG. CONTACT AT THE 42 YARD LINE. COVERING DARNELL MOONEY. KIRK: AT THE TOP OF THE ROUTE, THERE'S CONTACT BY DAVID. REALLY GOOD COVERAGE LINEBACKER. BUT HE JUST WRAPS UP MOONEY BEFORE HE CAN EVEN FINISH HIS ROUTE. MAKES BIG CONTACT. WATCH 54 RIGHT HERE. I THOUGHT HE MIGHT WORK TO HI HE LOOKED THAT WAY. THERE'S THE CONTACT RIGHT THERE. >> PASS INTERFERENCE. DEFENSE TO THE 54. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. KIRK: THEY WERE TRYING TO SET THAT UP WITH THE MOTION BY PITTS TO OPEN UP THE OUTSIDE TO DRAKE LONDON TO THE LEFT. HE CAME OFF OF IT BECAUSE OF THE TRIED TO GET IT IN THERE TO WOULD HAVE HAD A CHANCE BUT OBVIOUSLY THE PASS INTERFERENCE THERE SO THEY GOT A FIRST DOWN. AL: BARKING HIS DISPLEASURE AT THE OFFICIALS. FIRST DOWN AT THE 43 YARD LINE. 9:19 LEFT IN REGULATION. ALGAE ARE, SHORT AGAIN. KIRK: YOU TALKED ABOUT SEAN MCVAY HIS COACHING TREE. IF HE'S WATCHING, HE IS WATCHING OR HEARING ABOUT IT. YOU HAVE TO BE IMPRESSED ZAC ROBINSON. THIS GUY HAS BEEN A QUARTERBACK NOT LIKE HE WAS OUT THERE IS A COURT NADIR CALLING PLAYS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HE'S HAD THE CHANCE. TO CALL HERE HE IS. HIS WITH GAME. HE'S IN A BATTLE AGAINST TODD GOLDMAN IN THE SCHEME THAT HE HAS PUT TOGETHER TONIGHT. AL: SEAN IS WATCHING AND LOOKING AT FILM. THE BABY IS NOT TOO OLD FOR HIM TO DO THE 2:00 FEEDING. KIRK: ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF COUSINS SHOWING HIS EXPERIENCE. WATCH HIM LOOK LIKE -- RIGHT, THINGS ABOUT IT. HE'S BEEN DOING THIS OVERNIGHT -- ALL NIGHT. HE MAKES A GOOD DECISION. AL: THAT HE GO? HURRY UP HERE. NOCA -- HUDDLE. PEOPLE GET WRESTLED DOWN AND HOGTIED BY ANT SECOND DOWN AND A FLAG. KIRK: ANOTHER PENALTY FOR ATLANTA'S OFFENSE. >> NUMBER 63. REPEAT FIRST DOWN. AL: CHRIS LINDSTROM. HE AND GARY GARDEN BOTH PICKED IN THE FIRST ROUND IN 2019. KIRK: HOOKS A OUTSIDE ZONE GOING THE OTHER TRYING TO AVOID THE PENETRATION. RIGHT HOOK RIGHT THERE. PULLS HIM TO THE GROUND. TALKED ABOUT THAT BEING A PROBLEM. SOME POSITIVE YARDS. TWO STEPS FORWARD. ONE STEP BACK. AL: BACK THEY GO TO THE FIRST AND 20. SWING TO THE OUTSIDE. THE CLOUD WILL GO NEXT TO NOWHERE. BACK OVER THERE. SECOND AND 1 UPCOMING. SECOND DOWN TO THE HALFWAY MARK OF THE FOURTH QUARTER. RESET THE PLAY CLOCK TO 25. TACKLED AT ABOUT THE 37. THAT SETS UP A THIRD AND MEDIUM. THIRD DOWN AND 6. KIRK: GOOD TO SEE PITTS GETTING SOME YARDS AFTER THE CATCH. NOW THEY HAVE A MUCH MORE REASONABLE SHOT AT THIRD DOWN AND 6. AL: TO THE 30. FIRED WIDE OPEN AND DROPPED. OPEN BY A MILE. FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: WHAT INCREDIBLE ANTICIPATION HEREBY KIRK HE THROWS THE BALL WELL BEFORE MOONEY EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT TURNING AROUND. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS WHAT AFFECTED HIM YOUR OR NOT. WATCH COUSINS WHEN HE THROWS THE THERE IS YOUR RECEIVER ALL THE WAY UP AT THE TOP. I THINK THE BALL MAY BE PASSED HALFWAY. MAYBE HE JUST LOST SIGHT OF IT. THE BALL HITS HIM AGAIN IN THE CHEST AREA AL: RIGHT THERE. HERE'S A 54 YARD ATTEMPT. THIS WOULD TIE YET. WHAT? SO HE MISSED ONE. HAD THAT ONE BLOCKED. LOOKED LIKE COFFEE OR THOMAS JOSH -- JAVIER THOMAS KNOCKS IT 6:30 TO GO IN THE FOURTH. A REMAINS 30-27 TAMPA BAY. AL: -- NJOKU -- KIRK: IT'S NOT JUST A FIRST DOWN. HE WILL WALK AROUND HIM IN THE GO-AHEAD SCORE. THAT'S A TOUCHDOWN AND A MISSED OPPORTUNITY BY MOONEY. AL: AND THEN THE BLOCKED FIELD GOAL AT THE 44 YARD LINE. AFTER THE THOMAS BLOCK. MEANWHILE, THAT IS KNOCKED DOWN. MATTHEW JUDON, SECOND DOWN. KIRK: ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT STOOD OUT TO ME, LOVE TO SEE THE BACKS. BE JON ROBINSON GAINING A HELMETS OFF. LOOK AT HIM FIGHTING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT BLOCK. THERE'S THE DROP AGAIN THAT WOULD HAVE EVENTUALLY LED TO A HERE'S TEAR THOMAS GETTING A CLEAN ON THE RIGHT SIDE. ABLE TO BLOCK THAT AND KEEP THE THREE POINT LEAD. WHITE, DECENT GAIN HERE. COMES UP ABOUT A COUPLE OF YARDS SHY. KIRK: WHITE AT 215 POUNDS. WE'VE SEEN HIM A COUPLE TIMES. HAD A CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO BREAK THROUGH TACKLES. THAT WAS A BIG ONE THERE. AL: UNDER SIX TO PLAY. ESCAPES AGAIN. SLIDES TO A STOP AT THE 41 YARD WHEN HE NEEDS TO TAKE OFF, HE'S BEEN DOING THAT ALL YEAR LONG. KIRK: YEP. YOU KNOW THAT ATLANTA, THE BOOK ON THEM, THEY ARE THE HIGHEST BLITZING THIRD DOWN -- THIRD DOWN TEAM. SEE SOME NO PROBLEM. I WILL TAKE THAT ALL GOOD AWARENESS. KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE HE NEEDS TO EASY PASS TO THE THIRD DOWN MARKER. AL: FROM THE 43 NOW. UP BY THREE. KEEP IT ON THE GROUND. BUCKY IRVING. KIRK: THAT'S A HECKUVA SURGE THERE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE OFFENSIVE LINE. YOU KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO RUN. YOU ARE TRYING TO WORK THE CLOCK THAT ATLANTA DEFENSE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. WATCH THIS PUSH. THIS OFFENSIVE LINE IS STILL TRYING TO GROW. WORK THE DOUBLE-TEAMED. GET BACK TO THE LINEBACKER. GOOD PUSH UP FRONT TO GIVE IRVING PLENTY OF ROOM TO GET POSITIVE YARDS ON FIRST AND 10. AL: TAMPA BAY PROBLEMS. 153 YARDS ON THE GROUND. SECOND AND FIVE. PLAY-ACTION. IRVING, LOOK AT THOSE MOVES. ABOUT A YARD SHY OF THE FIRST CLOCK TICKING DOWN EVERY THIRD DOWN, THAT BECOMES HUGE. KIRK: THAT WAS A GUTSY CALL BY TAMPA TO THROW THE FOOTBALL. HE GETS IT IN THEIR. REALLY TIGHT. FORTUNATE FOR TAMPA TO GET POSITIVE YARDS. ANOTHER THIRD DOWN AND SHORT. ATLANTA BRINGING IN SOME BIG BODIES. AL: TAMPA AS WELL WITH THREE TIGHT ENDS HERE. SPLIT EVANS OFF TO THE LEFT. FIGHTING HIS WAY FOR HIS LIFE. THREE YARDS A CARRY. THAT WAS A BIG TIME THREE KIRK: IT WAS. SOMETIMES THE THREE YARD CARRY ON THIRD DOWN AND 3, FIRE A TEAM UP MORE THAN ANYTHING. GOOD JOB GETTING UP HE GETS MET EASILY. SHORT WITH GRADY JARRETT. THE LIKE DRIVE IS NOT SOMETHING WHITE IS KNOWN FOR. TOUGH YARD GREAT JOB. AL: UNDER THREE TO NOW. IRVING IS THE BACK. HE HAS IT. THE BALL IS OUT! THE FALCONS SAY THEY HAVE IT. SO TO THE OFFICIALS. KADEN ELLISS RECOVERS IT HERE GET THERE HE IS, COMING AWAY WITH THE BALL. KIRK: JESSE BASED. THE SAFETY COMES UP YOU TRUST THE ROOKIE, HE GIVES YOU TOUGH FLOODING. YOU BRING HIM IN FOR WHITE. WATCH NUMBER THREE COMING IN RIGHT HERE TO DISLODGE THE ELLIS IS RIGHT THERE TO POUNCE ATLANTA CATCHES THE BREAK THAT THEY NEEDED. CONFIRMED. AL: SECOND FORCED FUMBLE FOR BATES TONIGHT. SEVERAL YEARS AND CINCINNATI. CAME OVER HERE IS A FREE AGENT LAST YEAR. BIG TIME PLAYER. IRVING, WHO COULD HAVE COME CLOSE TO HELPING TO STEAL THE THEY WERE USING THE CLOCK PERFECTLY. NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN 2:50. A TON OF TIME FOR ATLANTA. ALGIERS, SMACKED AS HE CROSSES THE LINE. KIRK: ALSO ABLE TO GET INSIDE JAKE MATTHEWS INITIALLY BLEW THE PLAY UP. FORCED ALGERIAN SIDE. AL: NO-HUDDLE ON THE SECOND DOWN AND 12. NOW HE GOES. ALL KINDS OF HEAT THROUGH THE MIDDLE. THAT'S LOGAN HALL FLEXING HIS MUSCLES. KIRK: LOGAN HALL HAS JUST LOOKED LIKE A GUY WHO CAN TAKE THE GAME OVER ANY TIME THAT HE WANTS. SUCH LINKS. HE GETS THROUGH THE LEFT GUARD THAT TIME AND ALSO THE BACK. WHAT A RUSH. AL: LAST PLAY BEFORE THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING. CAN ONLY GET UP TO THE 20 NOW YOU'VE GOT A FOURTH DOWN. FOURTH AND 16. YOU ARE ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING WITH 1:52 AT LEAST THEY HAVE ALL THEIR TIMEOUTS. YOU WOULD THINK A LIKELY PUNT HAVE TO USE THEIR TIMEOUTS WHEN TAMPA HAS THE BALL. KIRK: THEY ARE DISCUSSING THAT RIGHT NOW. LONG WAY TO GO AGAINST A DEFENSE THAT LIKES TO DIE LET PRESSURE IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. I'M WITH YOU WITH THOSE THREE AL: AFTER THE GAME, STAY TUNED FOR THE JCPENNEY POST GAME SHOW. EXCLUSIVELY ON PRIME VIDEO. KAYLEE WILL HAVE THE STAR OF THE GAME CARISSA AND STURM AND TONY. THE GANG'S ALL HERE. KIRK: THEY'VE GOT A LOT TO TALK ABOUT. AL: PLENTY. PLENTY. KIRK: A SHOOTOUT BETWEEN THESE TWO QUARTERBACKS. IT STARTED FAST. OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOME BIG PLAYS IN THE FIRST HALF. BAKER MAYFIELD MATCHING HIM. GREAT PLAYS BY THESE RECEIVERS DOWNFIELD. HE WAS IN THE ZONE LIKE HE WAS LOOK AT THAT THROW RIGHT THERE. TO HIS COLLEGE TEAMMATE. MOONEY HAS HAD A COUPLE DROPS BUT HE'S MADE A COUPLE BIG PLAYS AS WELL FOR ATLANTA. NOW IT'S DECISION TIME HERE. AL: YOU'VE GOT A FOURTH AND 15. THEY DID CONVERTED A THIRD AND 14 EARLIER. I'M GOING TO SEE OF TODD BOWLES WILL SIT BACK OR IF HE CAN RELY ON THE FRONT TO GET HOME. AL: HAS TO GET TO THE 35. GOING FOR IT. FIRED OVER THE MIDDLE. INTERCEPTED AT THE 35 YARD LINE. THE HEART AND SOUL OF THE DEFENSE COMES UP WITH THE PLAY. KIRK: HOW FITTING. DAVID IN HIS 13TH YEAR, IN THE PLAY OF THE GAME. JUST IT'S BACK AT CENTER. WATCH HIM READ KIRK. SITS BACK. HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE HE NEEDS WAITING FOR THE POTENTIAL THROW. STEPS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THAT TO MAKE THE INTERCEPTION. GOOD JOB ON THE PASS RUSH, COMING AROUND TO GET INTO THE FACE. FORCES THE BALL OUT BY COUSINS. AL: DAVID WITH OVER 1500 TACKLES. THAT'S HIS FIRST PICK IN FOUR SEASONS. WHITE GOES NOWHERE. SLUNG DOWN. ATLANTA WILL NOW HAVE TO TAKE ALL OF ITS TIMEOUTS. KIRK: YOU AND I WERE TALKING BEFORE. YOU THOUGHT YOU WOULD SEE HIM USE THE TIMEOUTS AND GET THE BALL BACK AFTER TAMPA WOULD RUN THE FOOTBALL. AND NOW, STILL WITH THREE TIMEOUTS, NOW THEY HAVE TO STILL POTENTIALLY DO THE SAME THING. THEY HAVE TO HOLD HIM TO A FIELD GOAL AND THEN THEY'VE GOT TO DRIVE THE LENGTH OF THE FIELD. MAYBE DOWN SIX POINTS. TRY TO GET THE TOUCHDOWN TO WIN AL: FOURTH AND 15. THAT'S TOUGH. VERY TOUGH. THE PASS WAS INTENDED FOR IF TAMPA HOLDS ON, THEY WILL BEFORE-ONE. FALCONS WILL GO TO 2-3. KIRK: THEY PUT BUCKY IRVING BACK OUT THERE EVEN AFTER THE FUM TO SHOW THE CONFIDENCE THEY STILL HAVEN'T HIM AS A ROOKIE. AL: GIVE IT TO HIM. SECURES AT THIS TIME. THE FLAG IS DOWN. STOP THE CLOCK. MIGHT HAVE A FACEMASK HERE. NUMBER 62. AL: THAT'S THE CENTER, BARTON. DID THEY MISS A FACEMASK HERE? LET'S TAKE A PEEK. KIRK: SURE LOOKS LIKE IT. BARTON WAS DEFINITELY OFFSETTING ON GRADY JARRETT. GRABS ONTO THE JERSEY AS HE AL: STEADY ON SECOND AND 23. BACK AT THE 41-YARD LINE. 1:33 ON THE CLOCK. KIRK: STILL HAVE THE TWO AL: GOING TO THROWS A BACKSIDE SCREEN AGAIN. WANTS TO MAKE SURE HE STAYS IN BOUNDS AND HE DOES. KIRK: I KNOW IT'S A GUTSY CALL. I JUST HAPPEN TO BE LOOKING AT HIM LIVE. MIKE EVANS SNUCK OFF. THEY WANT TO BE CONSERVATIVE WHEN HE THINKS, OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS. EVERYBODY THINKING, RUN. AL: THIRD DOWN, 25. FALCONS ARE DOWN TO THEIR LAST TIMEOUT. FALCONS GO TO CAROLINA NEXT WEEK THEN SEATTLE COMES HERE. AND THEN AT TAMPA BAY. TAMPA BAY GOES TO NEW ORLEANS NEXT WEEK AND THEN BALTIMORE COMES TO TAMPA. KIRK: DO YOU RUN HERE OR GO HIGH PERCENTAGE PASS JUST TO MAKE HIM USE THAT TIMEOUT? THE LAST TIMEOUT. AL: KEEP IT ON THE GROUND. MAKE HIM USE THAT TIMEOUT. IRVING STOPPED AT THE LINE OF THE FINAL TIMEOUT TAKEN WITH 1:21. THE JETS ARE IN LONDON WITH MINNESOTA. YOU WILL SEE THAT ON THE NFL NETWORK. GREEN BAY AT THE RAMS. THEY ONE ON SUNDAY. CBS, ABC. DALLAS AT PITTSBURGH. MONDAY NIGHT, THE SAINTS GO TO KANSAS CITY. THE CHIEFS AGAINST NEW ORLEANS. KIRK: GOOD GAMES. AL: AND A GOOD ONE FO KIRK: COUSINS HAS DONE THIS AND DELIVERED MANY TIMES IN HIS ALL THEY NEED IS A FIELD GOAL. AL: TO SEND IT TO OVERTIME. HE LED THE DRIVE AT THE END OF THE PHILADELPHIA GAME TO WIN IT BACK IN WEEK TWO. GETTING LOOSE. TRENTON GO FOR THE PUNT. PUT SOME BACKSPIN ON IT. BOUNCES AND TAKES A GOOD BOUNCE ROLES INTO THE END ZONE. SO THE FALCONS, EVERY GAME HAS BEEN A ONE POSSESSION GAME. THEY LOST TO THE STEELERS IN WEEK ONE. ONE POINT WIN. THERE IT WAS. AGAINST THE EAGLES, LOSING BY FIVE IN A TIGHT ONE AGAINST LAST WEEK, 58 YARD. DIDN'T SCORE AN OFFENSIVE TOUCHDOWN BUT STILL ONE THE KIRK: SURPRISING THING IS THEY'VE BEEN GETTING PRESSURED THE LAST COUPLE SERIES WITHOUT DIALING UP A LOT OF BLITZES. THEY'VE BEEN RELYING ON THE FRONT END IS BEEN WORKING OUT FOR THEM. AL: COUSINS THROWS. BEHIND HIM. HE MAKES THE GRAB. THAT'S FIXED. TACKLE OUT OF BOUNDS WITH 1:08. COUSINS IS 394 YARDS. KIRK: SEVEN RECEPTIONS ON THE AL: LONDON THOMPSON, EIGHT. MOONEY ALSO HAS EIGHT. COUSINS FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE. OPEN AIR. PASS THE 40 YARD LINE. THAT'S MOONEY. KIRK: GOOD JOB BETWEEN THE TWO LINEBACKERS BY MOONEY. GOES RIGHT BACK TO HIM AFTER THE DROP. THAT TIME, LOW THROW. HOLD ONTO IT. AL: 411 YARD NIGHT FOR KIRK FIRES. COP. OUT OF BOUNDS AND THEN LOSES THE BALL OUT OF BOUNDS. THEY RETAIN POSITION -- POSSESSION. SINCE HE GOT TACKLED IN BOUNDS AND THRUST OUT OF BOUNDS, THE CLOCK KEEPS RUNNING. KIRK: HE THOUGHT ABOUT POTENTIALLY -- HE LOSES THE AL: RIGHT. HE HAS TO SPIKE IT WITH 21 HE WAS GOING TO GET TACKLED IN WAS TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE THE CLOCK KEEPS RUNNING. KIRK: KIRK COUSINS ON THE LAST TALK ABOUT SEEING A QUARTERBACK THAT'S TOUGH IN THESE SITUATIONS. THIS GUY IS AS TOUGH AS THEY COME. LOGAN HALL. LOOK AT THIS HIT. HE GETS HIGH. LOOK AT THE THROW TO MCLEOD WHO HASN'T HAD MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE PLAYS. HE DIALS THEM UP THERE WITH THE GAME ON THE LINE. AL: 30 CAREER GAME-WINNING IN HIS YEARS WITH WASHINGTON AND TO ALREADY THIS YEAR. THIRD AND 1. GETTING OUT OF BOUNDS. THE CROWD WANTS THE LAKE FLAG -- THE LATE FLAG. 17 SECONDS. KIRK: GOOD RECOGNITION. TAKE THE EASY OUT CUT TO LONDON. PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN. CLOSER AND CLOSER TO GIVING HIM A SHOT TO TIE THE GAME UP. AL: YOU WOULD BE LOOKING AT A 61 YARD FIELD GOAL IF THEY DON'T GET ANOTHER YARD. DROPPED. THAT TIME IT'S MCLEOD. GOOD TIGHT COVERAGE THAT TIME. KIRK: MCCOLLUM LOOKED LIKE HE MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN THE HAND DAN. THE BALL WAS THROWN WELL. A LITTLE BIT BEHIND HIM. HE MAY HAVE GOTTEN THE LEFT-HAND IN THERE TO KNOCK THE FOOTBALL THERE IT IS. GOOD PLAY. REFEREE: TIMEOUT ON THE FIELD. TAMPA BAY WILL BE CHARGED WITH A AL: MARKEES WATTS. IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO THE CLOCK. JUST COST HIM A TIMEOUT. 58 LAST WEEK. HE MIGHT HAVE TO DO IT FROM EVEN FURTHER THIS WEEK. KIRK: 12 SECONDS. NO TIMEOUTS. CAME IN TONIGHT FEELING GOOD. HIS SECOND ATTEMPT. THERE HE IS FROM 54. AL: THOMAS WITH THE BLOCK. KIRK: CAREER LONG LAST WEEK FROM 58. AL: IT'S A LITTLE DICEY. YOU CAN'T GET TACKLED A AT THIS POINT. KIRK: THAT'S THE TRICKY PART. HE'S HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS AGAINST THE ZONES WITH THE UNDERNEATH THROWS. GET UP TO THE BALL AND FIRE TO YOU'RE LOOKING AT FIVE TO EIGHT IT'S GOT TO BE REALLY FAST. AL: IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, GET TO THE BOUNDARY. THEY SPREAD IT OUT HERE. THEY ARE GOING TO GO OVER 28 YARD LINE. CAN THEY GET IT SPIKED? THEY CAN. ONE SECOND. THEY GOT THE EXTRA YARDAGE. KIRK: THAT'S CRAZY. HE'S FIRED UP ABOUT WHAT HIS QUARTERBACK DID. I THOUGHT THEY GOT THE BALL DOWN TOO FAR. I THOUGHT LONDON MIGHT TAKE A KNEE. HE KEPT RUNNING. THE CLOCK KEPT RUNNING. GIVE THE OFFENSE A LOT OF CREDIT. WELL SCHOOLED. THEY SPREAD INTO THE LINE. COUSINS FIRES IT WITH ONE SECOND REMAINING. AL: TREMENDOUS. THIS WILL BE A 47 YARD ATTEMPT. HE'S HAD BETTER NIGHTS BUT HE CAN SALVAGE IT HERE AND SEND IT TO OVERTIME. FROM 47. KIRK: DELAY OF GAME. THEY ARE CALLING IT A DELAY OF AL: THEY ARE. REFEREE: DELAY OF GAME BY THE FIVE YARD PENALTY. AL: THE PLAY CLOCK. THE LAST THING ABOUT IS THE PLAY CLOCK. KIRK: THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD GET A RESET. WHY WOULD THEY BE THINKING ABOUT A RESET? >> I DON'T SEE ANY REASON TO. THEY GOT THE BALL DOWN. PLENTY OF TIME TO GET THERE FIELD BALL -- WEIRD GOAL TEAM OUT. NOW WE'VE GOT A TIMEOUT HERE FROM TAMPA. REFEREE: TIMEOUT TAMPA BAY. THIS IS A 32ND TIMEOUT. AL: NOW YOU GO FROM 47 TO 52. HE IS MADE TO TONIGHT FROM 54 AND 48. MIST FROM 41 AND 54. DO WE GO TO OVERTIME OR DO HOME? KIRK: I'M STILL IN SHOCK HERE. THAT THEY WOULD PICK UP A BIG PLAY BY DRAKE LONDON AND THEY ARE CELEBRATING. EVERYONE IS EXCITED THINKING, WE WE FIRE THE BALL INTO THE GROUND. WE ARE ALL HIGH-FIVING OTHER. MEANWHILE, THE PLAY CLOCK HAS ALREADY STARTED. THERE'S NO RESET. THERE'S NO REASON TO RESET. HERE WE GO. EXACTLY. EXCITED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. THE FINAL PLAY OF REGULATION, BARRING A DEFENSIVE SOW. -- FOUL. 52 YARDS. AND -- OVERTIME! 3030 AT THE END OF REGULATION. KIRK: THIS IS A GREAT SHOT HERE. TWO WEEKS IN A ROW WITH THE GAME ON THE LINE. ONE TIME HE WINS IT, THE NEXT TIME HE SENDS IT INTO OVERTIME. RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE CLUTCH. MAY HAVE MISSED EARLIER. WHEN IT MATTERED, HE STEPS UP. LET'S NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE DECISION TO GO FOR IT ON FOURTH AND 15. IT WORKS OUT FOR MAURICE. THEY HAVE THEIR THREE TIMEOUTS. THEY USE THEM. THEY END UP GETTING THE BALL NO TIMEOUTS STILL DOWN THREE. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID. REFEREE: WE WILL PLAY ONE OVERTIME PERIOD OF UP TO 10 EACH TEAM WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO POSSESS THE BALL UNLESS THE TEAM THAT POSSESSES AL: OFF WE GO TO OT. THE KICK OFF THROUGH THE END WHEN TAMPA BAY HAD THE BALL AT THE END AND IN FIELD GOAL RANGE, YOU HAD THE HOLDING CALL, THEY MISS DAY FACEMASK -- THEY MISSED A FACEMASK CALL. KIRK: YOU CAN GO BACK AND LOOK AT THIS, THERE ARE BIG PLAYS THAT GAVE ATLANTA THE SHOT THEY NEEDED TO GET THIS INTO OVERTIME. NOW COUSINS IS THINKING TOUCHDOWN, LET' TOUCHDOWN, LET'S GET OUT OF AL: 440 YARDS, 39-55. THE RUNNING BACK IS ALLGEIER. THEY START WITH HIM. ABOUT A YARD, SECOND AND 9. KIRK: THE BIG THEME IS WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE PASSING, WHY ARE THE NUMBERS DOWN? COUSINS WITH THE PASSING YARDS. AL: SECOND AND9 AL: SECOND AND 9. UP TO THE 38 YARD LINE. COUSINS HAD THAT GAME WHERE THEY WERE DOWN 33-0, BEHIND. THIRD AND 3. CAUGHT AT THE 45 YARD LINE. LONDON IS SHAKEN UP. HE HAS NOW CAUGHT 12 TONIGHT, 13 TARGETS FOR 154. INJURY TIMEOUT. KIRK: IT IS KIND OF AN OPTION ROUTE AND UP TO HIM TO FIND THE SOFT SPOT. HE DOES A PERFECT JOB OF BEING PATIENT. HE IS FEELING SOME PAIN, AND HE AND COUSINS, IT IS THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR WE HAVE SEEN HIM IN SYNC AND ON TIME WITH HIS RECEIVERS. AL: A CAREER-HIGH IN PASSING YARDS, PASSES, 57 WITH COUSINS TONIGHT BUT HE WILL LOSE LONDON FOR AT LEAST ONE PLAY. MOONEY HAS CUT NINE, PITTS, KIRK: THIS IS WHAT FALCONS FANS ENVISIONED AND NFL FANS ENVISIONED WHEN THEY BROUGHT MOONEY OVER, LONDON, ROBINSON. JUST TAKING SOME TIME TO WORK INTO THIS RHYTHM. AL: HAJJ, #12, COMES INTO REPLACE LONDON FOR THE MOMENT. ROBINSON IS THE BACK. MOONEY MOVING. IT IS FIRED AND CAUGHT, AND THAT IS HODGE, AND HE WILL TAKE IT TO THE END ZONE. A MOST IMPROBABLE WIN FOR THE FALCONS. GO FIGURE. LONDON GETS HURT AND HAS TO COME OUT OF THE GAME. HODGE HAS NOT PLAYED MUCH TONIGHT, COMES IN AND SCORES. KIRK: OH MY GOSH, WHAT A NIGHT. WHAT A NIGHT FOR THESE ATLANTA WHAT A NIGHT FOR KIRK COUSINS. THAT IS 509 YARDS AND FOUR AL: 509 YARDS IS A FALCONS RECORD. KIRK: HE SPENT SOME TIME IN L.A. A COUPLE YEARS AGO FOR THOSE FIVE WEEKS, THEY WILL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN IN THREE WEEKS. WHAT A NIGHT TO BE HERE AND BE HONORED. THERE HE GOES. HIS ALTER EGO. A LITTLE SWAG
