INDIANAPOLIS COLTS AND THE TEAMS WITH SIX NS. DENVER WON THE TOSS. THEY DEFER. THE KICKOFF WILL BE INTO THE END ZONE AND BACK WE'LL COME TO THE 30 YARD LINE TO BEGIN THINGS ON THIS THURSDAY NIGHT. OPENING GAME OF THE 16th WEEK. JUSTIN HERBERT, 16 TOUCHDOWNS, ONLY TWO INTERCEPTIONS. ONE OF THEM CAME IN WEEK 2 AGAINST CAROLINA. THE OTHER CAME IN THE GAME LAST WEEK AGAINST THE TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS. SO THE CHARGERS COMING OFF WITHOUT QUESTION THEIR WORST GAME OF THE SEASON. HOW WILL THEY REBOUND? WAS LAST WEEK AN ABERRATION OR A HARBINGER? WE'LL FIND OUT TONIGHT. FROM THE 30 YARD LINE TO BEGIN. ON THE GROUND. WITH A GAIN OF ABOUT 4 YARDS, GUS EDWARDS, THE FORMER BALTIMORE RAVEN TAKES IT OUT THERE. HE'S MINUS HIS MATE, J.K. DOBBINS WHO WILL BE THEIR NUMBER ONE BACK. HE'S BEEN OUT FOR THE LAST FOUR WEEKS. THEY HOPE TO HAVE HIM BACK NEXT WEEK AT NEW ZEALAND. DIFFERENT OFFENSE WITHOUT HIM IN THERE. WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY'VE DONE. THEY MIXED THE JUICE, THE QUICKNESS THAT HE PROVIDED TO THAT RUNNING GAME. MUCH MORE PHYSICAL DOWNHILL WITH EDWARDS IN THERE. >> Al: YEAH, DOBBINS AVERAGING 4.8. AND EDWARDS AVERAGING 3.4. TAKES THE SWING PASS AND IS OUT OF BOUNDS. IT'LL BE 3rd DOWN AND RUN OUT THERE BY BRANDON JONES. >> Kirk: YEAH, YOU'LL SEE THIS OFFENSE GREG ROMAN IS THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. HE AND JIM HARBAUGH HAVE A LOT OF HISTORY OVER THE YEARS TOGETHER IN COLLEGE AND IN PRO. THERE HE IS. OF COURSE WAS IN BALTIMORE WITH HIS BROTHER, JOHN, FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. SO FAMILIAR WITH THE CULTURE AND WHAT THEY WANT TO DO, BUT TONIGHT, YOU KNOW, A BIT SHORT-HANDED WITHOUT DOBBINS. THE BATTLE IN THE TRENCHES, ESPECIALLY IN THE INTERIOR IS KEY. >> Al: THREE TIGHT ENDS WILL COME THE OTHER WAY AND GET STOPPED AT THE 35, BUT THERE IS A FLAG. CODY BARTON MADE THE TACKLE. WE SAW HIM AGAINST NEW ORLEANS THURSDAY NIGHT EARLIER THIS YEAR. HE WAS TREMENDOUS. PENALTY WILL BE DECLINED. PENALTY IS ON RASHAWN SLATER. SO IT'S A VERY FAST THREE AND OUT FOR THE CHARGERS. >> Kirk: THE HOLDING CALL ON THE LEFT TACKLE, SLATER YOU MENTIONED, HE'S GOING TO PULL AROUND, AND ONCE HE GETS HERE, HE GETS LOCKED UP. LOOK AT THE JERSEYS FLYING TO THE FOOTBALL. KNOWING THIS OFFENSE IS TRYING TO FIND PLAY MAKERS, AND A BIT, AGAIN, A LITTLE BIT PREDICTABLE WITH THAT PLAY CALLING HERE, JUST KIND OF FEELING THINGS OUT. >> Al: J.K. SENDING IT DOWN. AND MAKES A FAIR CATCH AT THE 20 YARD LINE. SO BO NIX, FIRST-ROUND PICK, SIXTH QUARTERBACK PICK. BEEN A GEM SO FAR. 20 TOUCHDOWNS, 11 COMING OFF A GAME IN WHICH HE HAD THREE TOUCHDOWNS AND THREE INTERCEPTIONS, BUT THEY FOUND A WAY TO WIN LAST WEEK AGAINST INDIANAPOLIS. >> Kirk: YOU KNOW, I THINK AS A ROOKIE A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOKED AT THAT AS THE WAY HE RESPONDED TO YEAH, HE MADE SOME BAD DECISIONS, THREW THE BALL INTO COVERAGE. BUT IT'S HOW YOU RESPOND. THAT'S WHAT HIS COACHES AND HIS TEAMMATES WERE REALLY HAPPY TO SEE. >> Al: McLAUGHLIN IS OUT TONIGHT, ONE OF THEIR RUNNING BACKS. START ON THE OUTSIDE, NICE GAIN BY JAVONTE WILLIAMS. TAKEN DOWN BY HENLEY WHO LEADS IN TACKLES. >> Kirk: IF DENVER'S SERIOUS ABOUT THAT, THEY'RE GOING TO GET BETTER. AND SEAN PAYTON WILL BE THE ONE TO TELL YOU IT'S BEEN BIG IN DENVER, THE LACK OF THAT RUNNING GAME. AND I THINK ESTIME IS GOING TO GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW WHAT HE CAN DO, THE ROOKIE OUT OF NOTRE DAME. >> Al: AGAIN ON THE GROUND. AND TRYING TO WORK HIS WAY FOR A FIRST DOWN IS JAVOPT A.I. WILLIAMS, AND HE HE HAS IT. UTE AT THE 40 YARD LINE. >> Kirk: NICE HOLD OPENS UP. JAVONTE WILLIAMS THERE WAS A LOT OF BIG EXPECTATIONS WHAT HE COULD DO. OF COURSE HAD SOME INJURIES. WAITING FOR HIM TO COME BACK AND BE THAT TYPE OF BACK RIGHT THERE WHERE HE FIGHTS FOR THAT SECOND AND THIRD EFFORT TO GET IT HE DID IT THERE. >> Al: MARVIN MIMS LINES UP IN THE BACK FIELD NOW. THE WIDE RECEIVER. THEY TOSS IT TO HIM, LOT OF SPEED, GETS AROUND A CORNER, BUT THEN FORCED OUT OF BOUNDS. BOSA IS RIGHT THERE TO FORCE HIM OUT AFTER A SHORT GAIN OF 2. 2nd DOWN AND 8. HAS COME OUT AND SAID RECENTLY ABOUT WE'VE GOT TO FIND WAYS TO GET 19 THE FOOTBALL. WE SEE WHAT HE CAN DO AS A RETURNER, AND RIGHT AWAY LINING UP IN THE BACK FIELD, ANOTHER WAY TO TRY TO GET HIS HANDS ON A BALL AND TRY TO GET HIM IN THE CORNER AND PICK UP SOME POSITIVES YARDS THERE ON A 1st AND 10 PLAY. >> Al: TRYING TO GET HIM ON A DEBOE SAMUEL ROLL. FOUR-MAN RUSH, GREAT PROTECTION. FIRED OVER THE MIDDLE AND A COUPLE OF YARDS SHY OF THE FIRST DOWN IS MICHAEL BURTON, FULL BACK. SO 3rd DOWN AND 2 FOR DENVER. >> Kirk: A NICE DECISION, A SIMPLE DECISION, YOU WOULD THINK, BY THE ROOKIE QUARTERBACK. BUT HE'S A DIFFERENT GUY THAN THIS CHARGERS TEAM MET IN WEEK 6, WHERE REALLY THIS DENVER OFFENSE STRUGGLED MIGHTILY IN THAT -- IN THAT FIRST MATCHUP. AND HE'S A DIFFERENT GUY THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE, THE UPS, THE DOWNS, AND THAT WAS AN EXAMPLE. PUTS THEM IN A BETTER POSITION HERE ON THAT THIRD DOWN BY JUST HITTING THAT CHECK >> Al: WILLIAMS BACK IN AS THE RUNNING MIMS IN MOTION, CIRCLING. GIVE IT TO WILLIAMS. WILLIAMS FOR A FIRST AND ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE CHARGER 38 YARD TACKLE THERE BY TONY JEFFERSON. GAIN OF 14. >> Kirk: IT'S A REALLY NICE JOB BY THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE OFFENSIVE WATCH THE RIGHT GUARD, 77 HELPS AND THEN CLIMBS UP TO THE LINEBACKER THERE. GETS HIS HANDS ON DENZEL PERRYMAN. AND I THOUGHT DENVER COULDN'T RUN THE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IN THIS OPENING DRIVE? THEY'RE MOVING PEOPLE OFF THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, AND THESE BACKS ARE RUNNING WITH AUTHORITY. LOOKS GOOD HERE ON THIS OPENING DRIVE. >> Al: NOW, BLAKE WATSON, THEY JUST BROUGHT HIM UP. HE IS THE RUNNING PLAYED AT MEMPHIS, FREE AGENT PICKUP. PLAY ACTION, UNDER PRESSURE. HE GETS IT AWAY. HERE AND PICKUPED UP AT THE FIRST DOWN. THEY GO TO NATE ADKINS, ONE OF THEIR TIGHT ENDS. ADKINS WITH A TOUCHDOWN LAST WEEK. SO DERWIN JAMES BUT THE PRESSURE UP, BUT NIX RIGHT THERE TO GET RID OF IT. >> Kirk: WATCH THE HEAD. RIGHT AWAY TURNS IT. SO THAT MEANS IN CASE HE GETS PRESSURE, HE'S GOT AN ANSWER. THAT'S REALLY GOOD JOB. OFFENSE THAT HE RAN SIMILAR TO WHAT HE DIZ SIMILAR TO WHAT HE DID IN COLLEGE. HEAD TURNED, NOT SURPRISED BY DERWIN JAMES THERE GETTING IN HIS FACE IN A HURRY. >> Al: THE NEW RUNNING BACK IS AUDRIC ESTIME. GIVE IT TO HIM, LITTLE HESITATION. YOU'VE GOT WILLIAMS, ESTIME, MIMS IN THE THEY ALREADY HAVE FOUR GUYS ON RUNNING BACK >> Kirk: THEY'RE SEARCHING. JESSE MANIPULATOR HAS HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS. WE'LL SEE HOW THEY'RE ABLE TO HOLD UP. THEY'RE PROTECTING THEIR CORNERS TONIGHT HAVING TO KEEP SAFETIES BACK. AND RIGHT NOW THE BRONCOS ARE MAKING THEM PAY FOR THAT, TRYING TO GET THEM OUT OF THAT LOOK WHERE THEY CAN THROW THE FOOTBALL MORE. >> Al: 2nd DOWN AND 7. WATSON EXPLOITS THAT HOLE. THROWS TO A FIRST DOWN HERE. BRONCOS ON THE MOVE AFTER THE CHARGERS STARTED THE GAME WITH A 3 AND OUT. >> Kirk: WATCH THIS. YOU KNOW, COACH WARNED -- SEAN PAYTON WARNED US ABOUT THIS YOUNG BACK, AND WATCH THIS CUT RIGHT WHEN HE GETS THIS FOOTBALL. THIS CUT BACK RIGHT HERE, THAT'S GREAT VISION. THAT'S REALLY A STRENGTH OF HIS IS TO FEEL THE DEFENSE. THEY'RE OVERFLOWING, PLAY'S DESIGNED TO GO RIGHT. FEELS THE BLOCK IN, CUTS IT BACK, AND GETS THOSE GREAT YARDS. ALMOST 7 YARDS A CARRY >> Al: YEAH, HE HAD ALMOST 100 YARDS LAST YEAR AT MEMPHIS. JAVOPT A.I. WILLIAMS BACK IN. COME UP TO THE PISTOL FOR THE FIRST TIME. PLAY CLOCK GOES TO ZERO, ACTION UP FRONT, PLAY WHISTLE DEAD. CLAY MARTIN TELLS US ITS BEEN POWERS TO MAKE IT A 1st AND 15. CLAY MARTIN, IT'S THE THIRD TIME IN OUR LAST FOUR GAMES HE'S TRAVELING WITH US. >> Kirk: EVERY WEEK. EVERY WEEK HE'S WITH US. >> Al: SEEMS TO BE. PAYTON CALLING IN THIS PLAY. THIS WOULD BE THE NINTH PLAY OF THE DRIVE. ONLY TWO PASSES SO FAR, SIX RUNS. >> Kirk: THESE GUYS RAN FOR 49 YARDS FOR THE ENTIRE GAME AGAINST THE COLTS LAST WEEK, RIGHT? >> Al: AGAINST A CHARGER DEFENSE THAT WAS SHREDDED BY TAMPA BAY. OFF THE FAKE, GOING CATCH IS MADE, GOOD BLOCKING, DOWN THE SIDELINE. THAT'S BLAKE WATSON. FLAG COMES IN AT THE END. SO THAT WAS A 1st AND 15. PICKED UP 13 YARDS. WE'LL SEE ABOUT THE CALL BY MARTIN AS HE GATHERS THE OFFICIALS. NEED A TEAM MOVING IN OTHER DIRECTION RIGHT NOW. SO TONY JEFFERSON GETTING THE START TONIGHT BECAUSE ELIJAH MOLDEN IS DOWN. >> Kirk: AGAIN, THIS OFFENSIVE LINE AND THESE YOUNG BACKS LOOK TO BRING TERRY IN. AND TERRY, WHAT DO YOU SEE THERE? >> KIRK, IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A NORMAL SHOULDER TO SHOULDER HIT. THERE'S SOME CONTACT TO THE HELMET. I DON'T SEE HIM LOWER HIS HEAD OR INITIATE OR MAKE FORCIBLE CONTACT TO THE OPPONENT. I REALLY DON'T SEE A FOUL THERE. >> Al: IT'S ABOUT A 3-YARD PENALTY AS IT TURNS OUT, HALF THE DISTANCE. ESTIME IS THE RUNNING THEY GIVE IT TO HIM, AND HE GOES IN FOR A TOUCHDOWN, IN BEHIND VAN POWERS. SO THAT DRIVE CONSUMES ALMOST 6 MINUTES, AND THE CHARGERS WHO WERE BURNED FOR ALMOST 500 YARDS LAST SUNDAY BY TAMPA BAY START THE SAME WAY TONIGHT. EXACTLY RIGHT. ALL THEY TALKED ALL WEEK ABOUT WAS HAVING A CHANCE TO AVENGE LAST WEEK'S GAME. LOOK AT THAT JOB, AGAIN, BY MINERS, THE RIGHT GUARD. A TEAM THAT'S HEARD ALL YEAR WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR RUNNING GAME. THEY OPEN IT UP ON THIS OPENING DRIVE, THAT'S A HECK OF A >> Al: ESTIME WITH HIS FIRST NFL AUDIBLE. >> Al: COULD YOU COULDN'T. >> Kirk: WE SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW. >> Al: ONE OF THE GREATS OF ALL-TIME. FORMER PARTNER OF MINE BACK IN 2000, 2001. MR. DAN FOUTS. SO WILL LUTZ TO KICK OFF AFTER THE BRONCOS GO 72 YARDS. AND THE CHARGERS WHO WERE 3 AND OUT OPPORTUNITY TAKE OVER AT THE 30. >> Kirk: WELL, LET'S SEE HOW THIS CHARGERS OFFENSE ANSWERS. THIS IS A GAME THEY DO NOT WANT TO GET AWAY FROM THEM. REPEATEDLY HOW LAST WEEK FINISHED, THAT SECOND HALF AGAINST TAMPA AND HOW BOTH SIDES OF THE FOOTBALL, THEY WERE FRUSTRATED. BUT AS A FIRST-YEAR HEAD COACH THEY TALKED ABOUT, GUYS, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE WEEKS LIKE THIS. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT, AND HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO IT? THEY'RE DOWN 7-0 AFTER ONE POSSESSION. >> Al: THE CHARGERS AFTER LAST WEEK GIVEN UP 37 POINTS WITHOUT SCORING. HERBERT PLAY ACTION, SWINGS IT OUT. LOOKING FOR ROOM, FINDS SOME IN THE INSIDE. NICE MOVE TO THE 41 GOES SCOTT MATLOCK. MUCH LIKE PATRICK RASHAD IN BALTIMORE HE PLAYS OFFENSE AND DEFENSE, ALL OVER THE PLACE. >> Kirk: HOW MUCH FUN IS IT TO WATCH A 300 POUNDER IN THE BACK FIELD. HOUPT HOW ABOUT THE NIFTY MOVES THERE BY THE 300 POUNDER? BY THE WAY, THIS GUY'S PLAYED DEFENSIVE MOVES HIS ENTIRE LIFE AND MOVED HIM SECOND DEFENSIVE GAME TO FULL HE'S GETTING A BETTER FEEL EVERY SINGLE WEEK AND ROMAN AND HARBAUGH ALWAYS HAVE THAT KIND OF GUY IN THEIR OFFENSE. >> Al: SIXTH ROUND PICK OUT OF BOISE STATE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. AND MEANWHILE THAT IS GUS EDWARDS, SHORT GAIN. TO KAYLEE WE GO. >> AS THE CHARGERS OFFENSE TRIES TO FIGURE THINGS OUT, THEIR SECONDARY IS, TOO. NOW ANOTHER, MARCUS MAYE WHO YOU SAW GO DOWN ON THAT LAST DRIVE, HE'S NOW IN THE X-RAY ROOM. WE'RE TOLD HE'S QUESTIONABLE TO RETURN WITH AN ANKLE INJURY. >> Al: CAM HART, HE'S OUT OF THE GAME. >> Kirk: GILMAN IS OUT. >> Al: NEEDS 3, GETS A LOT MORE THAN THAT. OFF TO THE RACES. TRIPPED UP INSIDE THE 40 YARD LINE GOES THE ROOKIE OUT OF TROY, SIXTH ROUND DRAFT PICK. >> Kirk: WELL, WE SAW MATLOCK HAS A NICE CATCH. NOW HE GOES BACK TO DOING WHAT HE SHOULD DO, AND THAT'S LEADING THE WAY FOR THE RUNNING BACK. AND VIDAL GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE JUICE. HE'S GOT A LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY. HE CAN GET YOU UP FIELD A LOT QUICKER THAN EDWARDS. THIS IS MATLOCK AGAIN. OPENS UP THAT LEFT SIDE. >> Al: VIDAL, 5'8" AND 215. BRING EDWARDS BACK IN. EDWARDS PICKS UP ABOUT >> Kirk: WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO TO THIS DENVER DEFENSE IS NOT EASILY DONE. VANCE JOSEPH REALLY SWITCHED THINGS AROUND AS A COORDINATOR WITH HIS DEFENSE IN YEAR TWO. IN THE PAST NOT TO BE TOO TECHNICAL. MEANING THE DEFENSIVE LINE WOULD GET THEIR HANDS ON THE OFFENSIVE LINE AND KIND OF LOOK INTO THE BACKFIELD, FREE UP THE LINE BACKERS TO MAKE ALL THE TACKLES. NOW IT'S MORE PIN THEIR EARS AND GET UPFIELD. AND WITH THE ADDITION OF JOHN FRANKLIN-MYERS AND MALCOLM ROACH, IT'S A VERY, VERY DIFFICULT DEFENSE TO RUN ON. >> Al: 2nd AND 8. HERBERT, GOOD PROTECTION, WIDE OPEN, MAKING THE GRAB, BUT TAKEN DOWN A COUPLE OF YARDS SHY OF THE FIRST DOWN IS QUENTIN JOHNSON. WE SHOULD POINT OUT BOTH OF THESE TEAMS AND ALONG WITH THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLE, LEAD THE LEAGUE IN FEWEST POINTS ALLOWED COMING INTO THIS GAME. >> Kirk: YEAH, THEY ARE DOING A GOOD JOB NOT JUST AGAINST THE RUN, BUT I THINK THEY'RE PLAYING WITH A LOT MORE CONFIDENCE IN WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO IN THIS ATTACK. YOU KNOW, VANCE JOSEPH, BEEN AROUND THE NFL FOR A LONG TIME, AND I THINK THE GUYS REALLY ARE FEEDING OFF OF HIS POSITIVITY AND HIS ENERGY MUCH BETTER THIS YEAR. >> Al: QUICK PACE DENVER ALMOST OFFSIDE. MEANWHILE THE CATCH IS MADE. TO THE 3 YARD LINE GOES JOSHUA PALMER. FOURTH YEAR, STEADY. MEANWHILE, THERE WAS A FLAG FOR OFFSIDE. THOUGHT DENVER WERE OFFSIDE, AND THEY WERE. >> Kirk: YEAH, GOT A FREE PLAY THERE WITH BONITTO JUMPING. >> Al: SO WITH 4:06 TO PLAY IN THE QUARTER, A GAIN OF 24 YARDS AND A 1st AND GOAL FOR LOS ANGELES. DEFENSE, EYES IN THE BACKFIELD OFF THIS PLAY ACTION GAME, AND BECAUSE OF THAT THERE'S A NICE OPENING BEHIND THE LINE BACKERS AND THE SAFETY 6, P.J. LOCKE AND THIS IS A PLAY, JUSTIN HERBERT IS AS GOOD AS ANYBODY IN THAT THE TIMING AND THE RHYTHM. HE PUTS IT RIGHT ON THE MONEY. >> Al: HE'S 4 FOR 4 OVER 43 YARDS. ON THE GROUND, TO THE MIDDLE, TO THE 1. GUS EDWARDS TO MAKE IT 2nd DOWN AND GOAL. THIS IS THE EIGHTH PLAY OF THIS DRIVE UPCOMING. >> Kirk: THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT DRIVE AND A GREAT ANSWER. SEE IF THEY CAN FINISH THIS OFF. NOW, THIS DENVER DEFENSE SECOND IN THE ENTIRE LEAGUE IN DEFENDING TEAMS IN THIS RED ZONE AREA, PREVENTING THEM FROM PUTTING TOUCHDOWNS ON THE BOARD. BUT RIGHT NOW THIS CHARGERS OFFENSE HAS A LOT OF MOMENTUM. >> Al: ELWARDS THE RUNNING BACK, FIRST IN MOTION. GOT A LOT OF LEVERAGE COMING OUT OF THAT BACKFIELD. AND CAN HE LEAN INTO THE TOUCHDOWN? YES, HE CAN! GUS EDWARDS STOPPED JUST OUTSIDE THE GOAL LINE, THEN THAT LITTLE LEAN WITH THE SHOULDER, AND IN HE GOES. >> Kirk: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I WAS SHOCKED THAT HE WAS ABLE TO USE HIS POWER. JIM HARBAUGH'S GOT TO BE FIRED UP. CODY BARTON HITS HIM AT ABOUT THE 2 YARD THIS GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE STRENGTH OF EDWARDS. HE GETS HIT RIGHT THERE, 2 OR 3 YARD LINE, BUT KEEPS HIS BALANCE, KEEPS MOVING THOSE LEGS AND GETS ACROSS THE GOAL LINE FOR ITTHE TOUCH DOWN. WATCH 55 GOES DOWN, CLEAN, GOOD LEVERAGE. I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO CHECK TO MAKE SURE THE BALL BROKE THE PLANE, AND LOOKED LIKE IT DID. >> Al: IT'S CONFIRMED, MATLOCK WAS ALSO INVOLVED IN THAT ACTION. CAMERON DICKER FOR THE EXTRA POINT TO TIE IT UP. AND AFTER GIVING UP THE LAST 37 POINTS OVER TWO WEEKS, THE CHARGERS NEEDED THAT MR. BEAST HIMSELF, JIMMY DONALDSON FROM NORTH CAROLINA GEARING UP FOR THE TWO-EPISODE PREMIER FOLLOWING THE GAME TONIGHT. >> Kirk: WOW, TONIGHT. IS IT COOL? >> Al: IT'S VERY COOL. >> Kirk: THAT'S THE MOST EXCITED YOU'VE BEEN IN THREE YEARS. >> Al: KIRK, IT SAYS PROMOS COMING UP. >> Kirk: YOU'RE FIRED EVEN IN THE MEETING YOU'RE LIKE -- >> Al: I KNOW THIS GUY. >> Kirk: ALL OVER THAT >> Al: HE'S BECOME A MAJOR ENTERPRISE. >> Kirk: I'M GOING TO DO A LITTLE RESEARCH. BY NEXT YEAR I'M GOING TO BE READY FOR CHICAGO. IF YOU'RE JUST TUNING IN WHAT A GREAT DRIVE BY THE DENVER BRONCOS. THIS IS A TEAM THAT'S BEEN CRITICIZED ABOUT THEIR INABILITY TO RUN THE FOOTBALL. SEAN PAYTON A LOT OF PERSONNEL. SOME SCREENS, BUT REALLY IT WAS THE CONTROLLING THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. THEY KNOW ABOUT JIM HARBAUGH'S REPUTATION. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE THEY LIKE TO PRIDE THEMSELVES ON WINNING AND BEING PHYSICAL AS WELL, AND THEY SURE WERE ON THAT OPENING DRIVE TO KIND OF SET A TONE. >> Al: NIX, DEEP DROP. SWINGS IT OUT, TACKLE'S MADE JUST AFTER THE CATCH IS MADE BY WILLIAMS. KRISTIAN FULTON COMES UP THERE TO STOP HIM AFTER A GAIN OF 2. >> Kirk: SAMUEL IS OUT, CAM HART IS OUT TONIGHT PLAYING ROOKIE, AND TARHEEB HILL. HE LIKES TO PLAY MAN-TO-MAN BUT PLAYING MORE ZONE BECAUSE OF THE CORNERS AND GOT TO PROTECT HIM. THAT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF THE SAFETIES BACK OFF HIM. I THINK HOW WILL ATTACK BECAUSE OF THAT BECOMES INTERESTING. NOT TO MENTION THEY WANT TO DISGUISE AND CONFUSE BO NIX. >> Al: EXTRA PRESSURE. BLOCK IS MADE UP FRONT. THE PASS IS A LITTLE BIT LOW. INTENDED THERE FOR TROY FRANKLIN, NIX'S TEAMMATE AT OREGON AND INCOMPLETE. 3rd DOWN AND 9. >> Kirk: THE OTHER THING TO THINK ABOUT IS DERWIN JAMES THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER HE PLAYS NICKEL, HE PLAYS SAFETY, HE PLAYS LINEBACKER. HE IS EVERYWHERE. WITH JESSE MINTER, IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC. HE AND DERWIN JAMES MEET ALL WEEK. WHAT HIS ROLE IS VARIES ON THE TONIGHT HE'S PLAYING A LITTLE BIT MORE SAFETY BECAUSE OF THE AND NOW WITH MAYE DOWN, HE'LL DEFINITELY HAVE TO PLAY BACK MORE THAN HE WOULD NORMALLY PLAY UPTIGHT. >> Al: THERE HE IS, 8 YARDS FROM THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. GOING TO KEEP IT AFTER FAKING A TOSS. AND PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN WITH HIS LEGS AFTER AT THE 43 YARD >> Kirk: JUST TALKING ABOUT DERWIN JAMES, AND YOU'RE RIGHT HE STARTED TO SNEAK DOWN AFTER THIS PLAY. WATCH THE PUMP FAKE BY THIS IS WHERE HE'S SO DANGEROUS. HE'S ELUSIVE. HE'S PAST THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, PUMP FAKE. AND THE VETERAN, AND THE VETERAN DERWIN JAMES FALLS FOR IT. JUST PLAYING THAT LITTLE BASKETBALL ON GRASS, RIGHT? HE GIVES HIM A LITTLE PUMP FAKE, HEAD FAKE AND ENOUGH TO GET THAT FIRST DOWN, NICE PLAY. >> Al: 1:40 IN THE QUARTER. NICE MOVE ZIGGING AND ZAGGING AND FINDING AN OPEN SPOT. ESTIME SCORED THE TOUCHDOWN. PICK UP THERE AT 9. >> Kirk: I THINK THIS GUY CAN BE A GREAT PRO IF YOU WATCHED HIM IN COLLEGE AT NOER DAME YOU KNOW HE'S GOT THE SIZE AND VISION. HE FEELS THAT, PUTS THE BRAKES ON THAT BLOCK, AND GOES UNDER THE BLOCK THAT'S ON KHALIL MACK. THAT'S GREAT PATIENCE, GREAT VISION. AND A LOT OF TIMES RUNNING BACKS, ROOKIES MAKE UP THEIR MIND AND THEY RUN. THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF HIM BEING PATIENT, LETTING THE BLOCKS ESTABLISH THEMSELVES AND GETTING BEHIND TO THE LEVERAGE AT HIS ADVANTAGE. >> Al: HAD 18 RUSHING TOUCHDOWNS IN SOUTH BEND LAST YEAR. BLAKE WATSON IN THE GAME, CARRYING THROUGH THE MIDDLE. THE BRONCOS WERE TO USE FOUR DIFFERENT RUNNING BACKS TONIGHT. ESTIME'S CARRIES FOUR TIMES, AND WILLIAMS AND WATSON EACH, AND MIMS HIMSELF. ACTUALLY FIVE GUYS HAVE CARRIED THE BALL ALREADY. >> Kirk: WE'VE SEEN MIMS IN THAT ROLE THE LAST THREE OR FOUR WEEKS WHERE HE'S HAD OPPORTUNITY TO GET IN THAT BACK FIELD. I'M WITH YOU, IT'S A REVOLVING DOOR RIGHT ONE THING THAT'S CONSTANT IS THAT OFFENSIVE LINE AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. >> Al: I LIKE MIKE TOMLIN, DISTRIBUTION OF LABOR. WHERE THAT PASS IS, KHALIL MACK GOT HIS HANDS ON IT. SO MACK BEEN AROUND 11 YEARS, NOW NO STRANGER TO THE PRO BOWL, KNOCKS IT DOWN. >> Kirk: YEAH, HE DOES A GOOD JOB OF JUST OUTSIDE, AND THERE'S THE ATHLETIC ABILITY. AGAIN, TALKING TO JESSE MINTER, I FOUND IT REALLY COOL TO HEAR THAT HE SAID KHALIL MACK AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, 11th YEAR, HE STILL APPROACHES EVERY DAY WITH A CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER. NOT HEAVILY RECRUITED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL, WENT TO BUFFALO. AND WITH ALL THE SUCCESS, STILL SHOWS UP EVERY DAY AT PRACTICE WITH SOMETHING TO PROVE. >> Al: 2nd AND 10. WANING SECONDS OF THE THAT'S CAUGHT. THAT'S A FIRST DOWN. AND THAT IS VELE, THE ROOKIE OUT OF UTAH, SEVENTH ROUND PICK. KNOCKS HIM OUT OF BOUNDS AND THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE SECOND END OF ONE IN SEAHAWKS AND RAMS TO WIN THE NFC WEST. ON THURSDAY NIGHT >> Kirk: CAN YOU BELIEVE, LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE STARTING TO BELIEVE. >> Al: SO AS PLAY RESUMES SECOND QUARTER, AL MICHAELS, KIRK HERBSTREIT, KAYLEE HARTUNG. ON FIRST FAKED. PASS IS CAUGHT BY COURTLAND SUTTON. THEIR LEADING RECEIVER, TACKLE THERE BY FULTON AFTER A 4-YARD PICKUP. >> Kirk: HERE'S AN EXAMPLE TRYING TO DISGUZ A FULL BO NIX. THEY START OUT A TOO HIGH SAFETY LOOK FROM JAMES. AND SNAP OF THE BALL THEY GO THERE AND THEY GO THERE. HE THINKS THE CORNER IS GOING TO DROP, AND IN REALITY HE REALLY DOESN'T. THEY TRY TO GIVE HIM A LOOK TO THINK HE WOULD HAVE AN EASY ACCESS THROW TO THE FLAG AND FULTON A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER. AGAIN, TRYING TO GET INTO THE HEAD NIX. >> Al: ROLLING, LOOKING, THROWING, CAUGHT AT THE 11 YARD SO HE GOES BACK TO BACK TO COURTLAND SUTTON, TRYING TO GET TO 1,000 YARDS THIS SEASON. MAKES THE STOP. FIRST DOWN. >> Kirk: YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF GUYS TRYING TO FILL IN INJURIES. LOOK AT ALL LOT OF THESE JERSEYS. EYES IN THE BACKFIELD. THERE'S NOBODY ON THAT FLAT HOLDING THEM. LOOK TO THE RIGHT. YOU BACK GETS IN LATE, BUT NICE JOB FINDING THE OPENING, AND HE IS SO GOOD ON THE RUN. >> Al: 100 RECEIVING YARDS TO THIS POINT THIS SEASON. SPINNING, STILL SPINNING. WORKING TO THE 3 YARD LINE GOES ESTIME. >> Kirk: WHAT A JOB HERE BY COURTLAND SUTTON WHO JUST MADE A BIG CATCH. THIS TIME HE HELPS OUT, THAT'S HIM ON THE FAR RIGHT, MAKES THAT BLOCK. DOESN'T HIT THE DEFENDER IN THE BACK, AND THEN TOUGH RUNNING. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FROM ESTIME. JUST WOULD NOT BE DENIED. LOOK AT THAT. LAST 3-PLUS QUARTERS THIS DEFENSE TALKED ABOUT HAVING A CHANCE TO COME OUT WITH SOME ENERGY AND JUST NOT SEEING IT YET. >> Al: 2nd DOWN AND 1. DENVER ALREADY 73 RUSHING YARDS. TO THE OUTSIDE. THE PASS IS CAUGHT AND TAKEN DOWN JUST ABOUT MARKER. VERY, VERY CLOSE. AS THEY CHECK IT OUT, IT WILL BE A FIRST MIMS MAKES THE GRAB. FULTON WITH THE STOP. >> Kirk: YEAH, THAT'S A HECK OF AN EFFORT THERE BY FULTON BECAUSE WELL-DESIGNED BY SEAN PAYTON. USES THE MOTION, TRYING TO CREATE THE REMEMBER YOU'VE GOT TWO BLOCKERS ON THE OTHER SIDE. FULTON KNOWS HE'S GOT TO MAKE THAT PLAY. HE'S GOT TO BEAT HIM TO THE CORNER. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THAT MOTION, HE KNEW IT WAS A FOOTRACE TO THE CORNER TO THE OTHER SIDE, AND HE GETS HIS HELMET ACROSS TO KEEP HIM OUT OF THE END ZONE. GREAT PLAY THERE BY 7. >> Al: 12th PLAY OF THE DRIVE. BURTON THE FULL BACK. WILLIAMS IS THE FAKE TO JAVONTE, NIX ROLLING, LOOKING, CAUGHT, TOUCHDOWN. MICHAEL BURTON, THE >> Kirk: SEAN PAYTON'S GOT THE HEATER WORKING HE'S GOT IT GOING AND YOU GIVE SEAN PAYTON AN OFFENSIVE LINE THAT'S PLAYING THE WAY THEY ARE, EVERYTHING OPENS UP. BURTON IS GOING TO WORK OUT TO THE FLAT. LOVE THE CALL. NOW IT'S A FOOTRACE, YOU KNOW, AND YOU BAIT BE ABLE TO MAKE AN EASY THROW TO THE FULL BACK FOR THAT EVERYTHING IS WORKING FOR THIS DENVER OFFENSE, A THING OF BEAUTY, REALLY. MAKE IT 14-7, WHICH HE DOES. EVERY COACH WANTS PERFECT BALANCE. SEAN WANTS TO RUN, BUT HE'S RUN 11 TIMES, HE'S THROWN 11 TIMES, AND HE HAS A 7-POINT LEAD.HE CHARGERS OVER THESE BRONCOS IN THEIR FIRST MEETING THIS SEASON, GUYS. >> Al: KAYLEE, ONE OF THESE TEAMS WILL HAVE A 2-5 RECORD AFTER >> Kirk: THAT'S RIGHT. >> Al: THEY HAVE TO. >> Kirk: I LOVE WATCHING BO NIX DURING TV TIMEOUTS. THE GUY IS INVOLVED. NO QUESTION WHO THE LEADER OF THIS IS. >> Al: DAVIS TAKES A KNEE. BALL COMES DOWN TO THE 30. LOOK AT HERBERT. >> Kirk: LOOK AT HERBERT. THIS IS WHEN HE'S HEALTHY, 100% HEALTHY AGAINST THE BENGALS, WEEK 11. LEFT ANKLE'S FINE, ABLE TO WORK THROUGH IT. THIS IS TONIGHT. SEE THAT BIG BRACE THAT KAYLEE TALKED ABOUT ON THAT LEFT ANKLE? SEE HOW WHEN YOU HAVE AN ANKLE LIKE THAT ON THAT LEFT FOOT, YOU JUST CANNOT DRIVE AND THROW WITH THE SAME AUTHORITY WITH YOU LOWER BODY. VELOCITY AND THE ACCURACY SO MUCH. NOW, HE IS 4-4 TONIGHT, SO HE'S OVERCOMING IT. TOUGH GUY. >> Al: HE'S NOW 5 OF 5, AND THAT IS LADD McCONKEY, THE GREAT LOOKING ROOKIE OUT OF GEORGIA WHO TAKES THAT ONE INTO BRONCO TERRITORY. A GAIN OF 27. TIGHT FORMATION HERE. WATCH THE DEFENSIVE BACK JUST KIND OF STARE. HE'S NOT REAL SURE WHO'S GOING TO PICK BOTH THOSE CROSSERS UP, AND A LITTLE BIT OF A MISCOMMUNICATION THAT WAS BRANDON JONES, THE SAFETY WHO'S DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB THIS YEAR COMING OVER FROM MIAMI. IN FACT, LEADS THE TEAM IN TACKLES. BUT THAT TIME JUST A BUST ON THE BACK END. >> Al: VIDAL IS THE RUNNING BACK HERE. DAVIS IN MOTION AND A GAIN OF ABOUT 2 TO THE 40 YARD LINE BY THE KIMANI VIDAL, AGAIN THE ROOKIE OUT OF TROY. >> Kirk: VIDAL AND EDWARDS BOTH COMING IN AND GETTING A CHANCE TO SHOW WHAT THEY CAN DO. WITHOUT J.K. DOBBINS, KIND OF SEARCHING A BIT IN THAT BACKFIELD. >> Al: THOSE GUYS ARE SEARCHING RIGHT NOW. ARE. >> Al: SAYING WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? BRONCOS RUNNING ROUGH SHOT. PICK UP THE BLITZER, AND THEN HERBERT HAS TO SLIDE TO A STOP. HADN'T BEEN AN EASY YEAR FOR JUSTIN. HE STARTED IN TRAINING CAMP. HE HAD PLANTAR FASCITIS AND THE INITIAL REPORTS WERE NOT VERY GOOD, BUT HE WAS READY BY OPENING DAY. 3rd AND 5. THEY GO NO HUDDLE >> Kirk: A LITTLE TEMPO, YEP. >> Al: FOUR-MAN RUSH. THROWS, CAUGHT. FIRST DOWN, AND THAT IS STONE SMART, TIGHT SO STONE SMART ASSUMING THE ROLE AS THE NUMBER ONE TIGHT AND HERBERT NOW HAS COMPLETED SIX PASSES TO SIX DIFFERENT RECEIVERS. >> Kirk: YEP. MESH CONCEPT. COUPLE OF RECEIVERS CROSSING. NOBODY PICKS HIM UP. THE REASON YOU SAW TEMPO, THAT'S TO PREVENT THE BRONCOS FROM GETTING THEIR NICKEL OR THEIR DIME PACKAGE IN. SO THEY HAD TO STICK WITH THEIR BASE THAT'S AN ADVANTAGE FOR THE CHARGERS AND A GOOD JOB THERE BY GREG ROMAN GOING WITH THAT TEMPO LOOK. >> Al: OUT OF THE PISTOL THIS TIME. EDWARDS IS THE RUNNING GIVE IT TO HIM. TRIES TO CUT IT BACK, TAKES IT TO THE 23. ELLIS, 52, AND LOOK AT GREG ROMAN. >> Kirk: GREG ROMAN WELL RESPECTED. DOES A GOOD JOB. LIKE I SAID HE GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO JIM HARBAUGH. STANFORD DAYS WHEN LOCKE WAS A QUARTERBACK AND IN SAN FRANCISCO HAD GREAT YEARS THERE AND NOW BACK WITH HIM NOW THAT HARBAUGH IS BACK IN THE NFL LEADING THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. >> Al: NOW YOU'VE GOT HASSAN HASKENS IN THE BACKFIELD FOR THE FIRST TIME. A LITTLE SIDE ARM THROW. SMART AGAIN TRYING TO WORK HIS WAY FOR A VERY CLOSE. >> Kirk: I DON'T KNOW THERE'S ANYBODY AS GOOD. I MEAN THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT QUARTERBACKS OUT THERE, BUT THIS GUY ON PLAY ACTION AND THE SCREEN GAME, WATCH THE MECHANICS, AND WATCH HIM SELL THIS. LOOKING RIGHT, LOOKING RIGHT, AND THEN SLIPS LIKE YOU SAID KIND OF THAT -- CHANGES THE ARM ANGLE, SIDE ARM AROUND THE DEFENDER. KNOWS HE'S COMING THE WHOLE TIME. JUST FLIPS IT RIGHT AROUND HIM, AND THERE'S AGAIN SMART LOOKING FOR A CHANCE TO GET HIS HANDS ON >> Al: 9:30 LEFT IN THE FIRST HALF. THIRD DOWN AND INCHES. MATLOCK STEPS UP. IN THE SLOT, GOES HAND THE BALL TO EDWARDS, AND HE IS STOPPED IN THE SO THEY HAD LEVERAGE THERE, BUT ZACH ALLEN SAID YOU AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE. >> Kirk: WOW. THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE. I MEAN, THAT'S JUST ANTICIPATING THE SNAP COUNT. GOOD JOB OF DEALING WITH THAT JUMBO LOOK. LOOK AT THE SIZE. AND HERE'S ALLEN RIGHT HE JUST GOT OFF THE BALL A LOT QUICKER THAN ANYBODY ELSE, JUST WANTED THE LINE BUT GET OFF SALYER, COMPLETELY SURPRISED. AND SET THE EDGE ON THE OTHER SIDE, NOWHERE TO GO. REALLY GOOD DEFENSE >> Al: HAVE TO SETTLE FOR A 37 YARD FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT BY CAMERON DICKER. SO THEY WENT PICKS. HE AND SEAN PAYTON START TO REALIZE WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO WELL, WHAT HE'S SAYING. LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE IN HOW HE'S BEEN ABLE TO PLAY, AND EVEN TONIGHT, JUST THE COMMAND OF THIS OFFENSE, JUST THE CONFIDENCE THAT HE EXUDES. I MEAN, IT'S -- IT'S PRETTY SPECIAL WHEN YOU SEE A ROOKIE QUARTERBACK PLAY THE WAY THIS GUY IS. >> Al: PLAYED FIVE YEARS IN COLLEGE, THREE IN AUBURN, TWO AT OREGON AFTER THAT. WHAT, 61 GAMES HE PLAYED IN COLLEGE? >> Kirk: YEAH, I THINK THAT EXPERIENCE REALLY HELPS HIM. HE'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF ADVERSITY. HIS THREE YEARS AT AUBURN, IT WAS HIS DREAM SCHOOL. HE BASICALLY LEFT THERE AND SAID I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS AND WENT OUT TO EUGENE, OREGON, AND CHANGED HIS ENTIRE CAREER WHEN HE WENT OUT TO PLAY FOR THE DUCKS AND GAVE HIM THIS OPPORTUNITY WHERE HE'S NOW A FIRST ROUND DRAFT PICK AND PLAYING FOR SEAN PAYTON IN DENVER. MAN, THIS GUY JUST GREW UP WITH THE GAME. IN THE LOCKER ROOM WITH HIS DAD SINCE PROBABLY HE WAS 5 YEARS OLD. JUST A COACH'S SON, THE EPITOME OF THAT. >> Al: WILLIAMS IS THE RUNNING BACK, AS THEY BEGIN THIS DRIVE. BRONCOS TWO LONG TOUCHDOWN DRIVES START WILLIAMS LOOKING FOR A BLOCK, GETS IT. PICKS UP ABOUT 4. TART MAKING THE WE GO TO KAYLEE. >> GUYS, FROM THE DAY COURTLAND SUTTON MET BO NIX HE'S FELT HE'S MATURE FOR A ROOKIE. SUTTON TOLD ME IT'S IMPRESSED HIM TO WATCH KNICKS'S STYLE OF LEADERSHIP. KNICKS HAS STAYED TRUE TO WHO HE IS. HE'S CONFIDENT, COMPETITIVE, NOT AFRAID TO SPEAK HIS MIND AND THAT'S ALLOWED HIM TO TAKE CONTROL OF THIS LOCKER ROOM AND THAT SIDLINE AS YOU'VE SEEN ALL >> Al: YOU CAN SEE THAT VISUALLY. LET'S GO BACK TO DON'T FORGET RUSSELL WILSON CAME IN FOR TWO YEARS, OKAY? TREMENDOUS TRADE, THE WHOLE THING DID NOT WORK OUT. SO NOW THEY HAD TO GO TO THE DRAFT. MEANWHILE, YOU HAD JARRETT STIDHAM WHO BACKED UP IN NEW ENGLAND. YOU HAD ZACK WILSON WHO WAS A STARTER AND JETS CHOICE A FEW YEARS BACK, AND IT WAS A COMPETITION. BUT EARLY ON IN THE COMPETITION YOU COULD FEEL IT. AND SEAN PAYTON TOLD US I KIND OF KNEW I KIND OF KNEW IT, AND THEN I HAD TO WAIT LATER IN TRAINING CAMP, LATER IN FREE SEASON TO MAKE THE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT. AND MEANWHILE, MIMS WAS THERE. POONA FORD HAVING A FINE SEASON, KNOCKING IT DOWN. GOING TO BE 3rd DOWN AND 11. >> Kirk: I THINK SEAN PAYTON SAW IT AND FELT IT, BUT I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY THE VETERANS ON THE TEAM WERE TALKING TO SEAN PAYTON AND VANCE JOSEPH AND SAYING AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS OF OTA'S PRIVATELY, HEY, MAN, WE'VE GOT A AND SO LONG WAY TO GO, GREAT GAMES. 14-10, BUT HE'S AN IMPRESSIVE PLAYER. WE'LL SEE HOW THIS CHARGERS DEFENSE LOOKING FOR A BREAK, LOOKING TO GET OFF THE FIELD AND GET A STOP. >> Al: 3rd AND 11. DEEP DROP. CHECKS IT DOWN. AND FINAL THRUST HAS NETTED THE FIRST DOWN FOR JAVONTE WILLIAMS. STILL MAKING THE NEEDED 11, GOT IT. >> Kirk: BO NIX HADN'T BEEN TOUCHED TONIGHT. HE'S A GUY PRETTY DECISIVE, HAS GOOD FEET. THIS TIME MACK IS DOUBLE-TEAMED. ADKINS HELPING OUT. HE HAS TIME TO SELL IT DOWNFIELD, CHECKS IT DOWN, ANOTHER SMART AND WHAT A JOB THERE BY WILLIAMS OF GETTING NORTH AND SOUTH AFTER THAT CATCH AND KNOWING EXACTLY WHERE HE NEEDED TO GO FOR THAT >> Al: YOU'RE RIGHT, CHARGERS WITH NO RUSH LAST WEEK. AND BAKER MAYFIELD BARELY HAD A SHOWER AFTER THAT SECOND HALF. MEANWHILE, IT'S MIMES DOWN THE SIDELINE. MIMS STAYS INBOUNDS, BEING CHASED ALL THE WAY TO THE 3 YARD LINE BY DERWIN JAMES. FINALLY STOPS HIM. 55 -- 55 YARDS. >> Kirk: REALLY GOOD THERE'S MIMS AGAIN IN THE BACK FIELD, KIND OF THAT LOOK. THAT'S A GREAT ANGLE THAT ALLOWS MIMES TO GET OUTSIDE AND PICK UP ALL THOSE YARDS, AND EVENTUALLY DERWIN JAMES PICKS HIM UP, PLAYS DIFFERENT SPOTS. YOU SEE HOW HE CAME UNDERNEATH, MAYBE UNDERESTIMATED THE SPEED AND BURST THERE OF MIMS, BUT MIMS GOT TO THAT CORNER, AND HE WAS ABLE TO GET BIG YARDS DOWN THE >> Al: TACKLED BY THE PASS IS THROUGH THE HANDS. THAT TIME OF JAVOPT A.I. WILLIAMS. 2nd AND GOAL WITH 6:30 MINUTES LEFT IN UNTIL THE HALF. >> Kirk: HE PUTS IT OUT THERE. ONE THING ABOUT BO NIX, HE'S GOT SO MUCH COMPETITIVE ENERGY. SOMETIMES IT EFFECTS HOW HE GOES THROUGH PROGRESSIONS, STOOSOMETIMES ON A THROW HE PUTS A LITTLE TOUCH ON IT. HE THROWS THAT 90 MILE AN HOUR FAST BALL, AND IT GOES THROUGH THE HANDS OF WILLIAMS. >> Al: ESTIME IN THE ALREADY HAS A TOUCHDOWN TONIGHT. 2nd AND GOAL. HE KEEPS, HE THROWS. VELE, AND THE FLAG IS >> Kirk: IT'S CHARGERS OFF SIDES. THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE TO ME. THEY WALKED BACK A DEFENSIVE BACK. LOOKED LIKE HE WAS STARTING TO JUMP AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. MAYBE A MAN DOWNFIELD. >> Al: SO THE OFFICIAL PUT A HAND THE TOP OF HIS HEAD, WHICH IS THAT INDICATION. OFFSETTING. >> Referee: THERE'S NO FOUL ON THE PLAY FOR AN INELIGIBLE MAN DOWNFIELD AS NUMBER 77 WAS ENGAGED BLOCKING. RESULT OF THE PLAY IS A TOUCHDOWN. >> Al: THEY SAY MEINERZ WAS ENGAGED IN BLOCKING. IT WAS MARTIN'S CALL. AFTER THE FLAG WAS THROWN. HE'S DOING TONIGHT ON MEINERZ RIGHT HERE, THAT'S A NEW RULE FOR ME. I DIDN'T REALIZE, I MEAN LOOK HOW FAR HE IS DOWN. I MEAN HE'S 4, 5 YARDS DOWNFIELD, BUT HE'S ENGAGED IN A BLOCK. TERRY, I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT CALL. >> Al: THREE DRIVES, THREE TOUCHDOWNS. WIL LUTZ WITH THE EXTRA POINT. AND THE DENVER BRONCOS >> Al: ALL RIGHT, BACK TO THE TOUCHDOWN. TERRY, COME ON IN HERE AND TELL US EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAW IN THIS >> YEAH, AL. IT'S LEGAL FOR AN OFFENSIVE LINEMAN TO ENGAGE A DEFENSIVE LINEMAN ON HIS INITIAL CHARGE AND DRIVE HIM DOWNFIELD. BUT HERE 77 CHIPS AND THEN GOES DOWNFIELD ON HIS OWN, WELL BEYOND 1 YARD. THEY SHOULD HAVE LEFT THE FLAG DOWN FOR AN INELIGIBLE DOWNFIELD. THIS IS A FOUL. >> Al: YEP. WELL, YOU SAW A PENALTY MARKER. YOU SAW THE OFFICIAL PUT HIS HAND ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD, AND YOU CAN SEE WHERE JIM HARBAUGH IS THINKING ABOUT AS THEY GIVE HIM THE EXPLANATION. SO THEY GET AWAY WITH ONE. THEY HAVE AN 11-POINT LEAD TO THE BRONCOS. AND THE CHARGERS WILL GET IT WITH 6:22 REMAINING IN THE FIRST WELL, THE CHARGERS -- RIGHT NOW THE CHARGERS, PHILLY, AND DENVER GIVING UP THE FEWEST POINTS IN THE LEAGUE. BUT OVER THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS -- LAST TWO QUARTERS IN THE TAMPA BAY GAME ON SUNDAY, 517 TOTAL YARDS AND 48 POINTS. >> Kirk: YEAH, AND YOU COULD -- YOU COULD LOOK AT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS. ELIJAH MOULTON IS NOT PLAYING TONIGHT, GILMAN, CAM HART OUT, MARCUS MAYE OUT. KHALIL MACK, BOSA, YOU DON'T FEEL THEIR PREZ NSZ OUT ON THE FIELD AT ALL. PROBABLY PLAYING THROUGH INJURIES, ESPECIALLY BOSA. >> Al: TACKLE BY D.J. JONES. LITTLE EXTRA STUFF GOING ON WITH HURST AND ONE OF THE BRONCOS. >> Kirk: TRYING TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS. I THINK THE BIGGEST THING WE SEE FROM UP HERE WITH A LOT OF NEW FACES, JUST WANT TO SEE MORE ENERGY, MORE, YOU KNOW, GUYS FLYING TO THE FOOTBALL. THERE'S GUS EDWARDS. >> Al: THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN OBVIOUSLY WITH DOBBINS HURT. VIDAL IS GOING TO BE THE BACK RIGHT NOW. THEY SEND HIM HERBERT COMES TO THE RIGHT SIDE, AND IT'S CAUGHT BY JOSHUA PALMER FOR A VERY SHORT GAIN AND A THIRD DOWN COMING UP. >> Kirk: HELPS TO HAVE EXPERIENCE FOR JUSTIN HERBERT WHEN YOU GET INTO A GAME LIKE THIS AND THE DEFENSE IS SEARCHING, AND THEY HAVEN'T COME UP WITH STOPS AS A DEFENSE. IT PUTS A LITTLE PRESSURE ON THAT QUARTERBACK AND THAT OFFENSE TO TRY TO KEEP PACE WITH WHAT BO NIX AND DENVER IS DOING. THE TIME YOU CAN PRESS, YOU CAN FEEL THAT URGENCY TO HAVE TO MAKE A PLAY. HERBERT'S GOING TO HAVE TO AVOID THAT. >> Al: 3rd DOWN AND 3. HERBERT HANGING IN THE POCKET, FIRES, AND NOT CAUGHT THAT TIME. COVERAGE GOOD. PALMER PASSED A LITTLE BIT BEHIND HIM. BRANDON JONES COVERING ON THE PLAY, AND IT'S FOURTH DOWN, AND AN L.A. PUNT FORTHCOMING. >> Kirk: THAT IS A TIGHT WINDOW TO GO BETWEEN SURTAIN IN YOU'VE GOT TO THROW IT OVER TOP OF SURTAIN THIS TIME ZONE, AND GET IN THERE BEFORE JONES CAN COME IN AND SEPARATE PALMER FROM PUTS IT ON A LINE BUT JUST BEHIND HIM A BIT. TOUCH CATCH THERE FOR PALMER. >> Al: FIRST INCOMPLETION FOR HE'S NOW 8 OUT OF 9. SKY HIGH PUNT. FAIR CATCH MADE CALL. EXACTLY 5 MINUTES LEFT IN THE OPENING HALF. IN THE OPENING GAME LOOK DOWN HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD ON THIS BRONCOS THREE POSSESSIONS, THREE TOUCHDOWNS. THEY'VE ALREADY RUN 28 PLAYS FOR 219 YARDS. RUNNING BACK IS THE ROOKIE BLAKE WATSON. JUST CALLED UP, ACTIVE DUTY. FAKE TOSS. NIX ON THE RUN, CHASED BY BOSA. PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN AND A FEW MORE YARDS. SO FOR THE SECOND TIME TONIGHT NIX TAKES OFF. HE'S GAINED 15 AND 10 ON THE TWO CARRIES. >> Kirk: THAT'S A GREAT CALL AGAIN BY SEAN PAYTON. YOU'VE GOT BOSA NOT 100%, GUTTING IT OUT SO YOU GO BOOT BACK THE OTHER WAY. WHAT A CHALLENGE, HE'S CHASING AND NOW THE OTHER DIRECTION. HE'S HAD A HIP INJURY MOST OF THE YEAR, TRYING TO GET THROUGH AND YOU'VE GOT TO CATCH UP TO THIS GUY WHO'S RUNNING AND HE CAN GO NOW AS A AND GOOD CALL THERE ON 1st AND 10. >> Al: YOU'RE SO RIGHT, THAT HIP INJURY. I MEAN HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HE HAS TOSSED IN THE PAST. 1st AND 20. NIX UNDER PRESSURE AND THEY FINALLY GET TO THE CHARGERS HAVE PUT NO PRESSURE ON MAYFIELD LAST WEEK FOR MOST OF THE GAME, FINALLY GET A SECK AND BOSA. >> Kirk: THERE'S BOSA. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GUTTING IT. THIS TIME RIGHT OFF THE BALL. LOOK AT THE HANDS. YOU KNOW, HE'S GOT THE SIZE AND THE POWER, BUT HE'S A TECHNICIAN. GOOD JOB WITH A HAND. HE GETS OFF A BLOCK AND JUST CLOSES IN ON THE POCKET. THEY HAD APPRECIATION FOR BO NIX'S ABILITY, SO THEY WANT TO SQUEEZE THE POCKET. YOU SEE THE BLITZ THERE BY DERWIN JAMES, SO THEY DIAL-UP THE GOOD CALL BY MANIPULATOR AND MANIPUL MINTER TO GET IN THERE. >> Al: HE SAYS WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, FIFTH SACK OF THE SEASON. SECOND TIMEOUT TAKEN 30-SECOND TIMEOUT. TALKED ABOUT KHALIL MACK AND BOSA. FOR THIS TEAM TO NOT ONLY BE COMPETITIVE TONIGHT BUT FOR THIS TEAM TO MAKE A RUN, ALPHAS. THEY NEED THEIR GUYS TO BE AS EFFECTIVE AND AS DOMINANT AS THEY CAN BE AT CRUNCH TIME. AND YOU CAN SEE, I MEAN MACK IS A GUY THAT IN HIS 11th YEAR STILL HAS THE JUICE, STILL CAN MAKE PLAYS. BOSA, AS I INDICATED, HAS BEEN BATTLING THROUGH SOME INJURIES. GREAT TO SEE HIM OUT THERE FIGHTING THROUGH THAT TIME HE'S ABLE TO COME UP RIGHT AFTER THAT BOOT THAT WENT AROUND HIM THE VERY NEXT PLAY, THEY DIAL-UP THE PRESSURE, AND BOSA WINS THAT ONE-ON-ONE MATCHUP WITH McGLINCHEY ON THAT RIGHT SIDE. >> Al: 2nd AND 18. VERY IMPORTANT DRIVE FOR THE CHARGERS TO STOP THEM HERE. HALF WINDING DOWN, AND THE BRONCO'S GOING TO GET THE BALL TO START THE THIRD QUARTER. 2nd AND 18 AFTER DENVER TOOK THAT LAST TIMEOUT. EXTRA PRESSURE. JAMES COMING THROUGH, CATCH IS MADE UP PAST THE 40 YARD LINE, TAKEN DOWN IS STOP THEREAFTER STOP THEREAF AFTER A GAIN OF 12 TO MAKE IT 3rd DOWN AND 6. >> Kirk: YOU BRING JAMES AGAIN DIALING UP PRESSURE NOW. 33 THE BACK, WILLIAMS SEES IT BUT HE ACTUALLY MISSES. BO NIX DOES A GOOD JOB KEEPING FOCUS FOUND THE MATCHUP HE WANTED AND GETS THE BALL TO SUTTON FOR BIG YARDS THERE. THEY GET INTO THE HOLE AFTER THE SACK AND THE CALL THERE AND THE EXECUTION. NOW THEY'VE GOT A REAL SHOT HERE ON THIRD >> Al: DENVER'S CONVERTED ALL THREE THIRD DOWNS. A CHARGER CAN'T GET OFF THE FIELD. PLAY CLOCK AT ONE. EXTRA MAN COMES, PASS IS BROKEN UP. VELE WAS THE INTENDED RECEIVER, AND SO FINALLY THE CHARGERS ARE ABLE TO STOP THEM AND WILL GET THE BALL GET HIM BEHIND THE STICKS. AND JESSE MINTER, NOW, HE'S A DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR. HE'S ABLE TO DICTATE THINGS. THEY WALK SEVEN LINES UP TO THE LINE OF THEY END SEVEN BUT DROPPING YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S COMING. ABLE TO EFFECT BO NIX. HE'S ABLE TO KNOCK THAT BALL AWAY ON A PRETTY WELL THROWN BALL. >> Al: RILEY DIXON, HIS FIRST PUNT OF THE NIGHT. WAITING FOR IT AT THE 9, DERIUS DAVIS. AND DAVIS WRIGGLES HIS WAY UP TO THE 25 YARD 2:34 TO HALFTIME, AND WE'RE BACK >> Al: NIX AND SUTTON GOING OVER THE LAST ROUTE, AS THE CHARGERS TAKE OVER HERE AT THEIR OWN 25 YARD 2:34 AND THE CHARGERS HAVE ALL THREE TIMEOUTS. PLENTY OF TIME. PASS COMES OUT INTO THE FLAT HERE. DERIUS DAVIS WHOSE SPEED JUST RAN THAT KICK BACK. PICKS UP 12, TACKLED BY BRANDON JONES. HASKINS OUT IN FRONT. GOOD DRIVE, GOOD WAY TO GET A PLAYOFF BEFORE THE 2 MINUTE WARNING. >> Al: BACKING HIS WAY FOR ANOTHER COUPLE IS HASKINS. PLAYED IN MICHIGAN. 2-MINUTE WARNING WITH THE DENVER BRONCOS UP BY 11. LEFT. >> Al: THAT MAN RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. HE KNOWS THE AREA. HE'S A SOCAL GUY. 2 MINUTES TO HALFTIME. 2nd DOWN AND 5. PLAY ACTION. PASS IS CAUGHT. WIDE OPEN. McCONKEY TAKEN DOWN INSIDE THE 40 AT THE 37 YARD LINE. BRANDON JONES MADE THAT TACKLE, A GAIN OF 21. >> Kirk: COUPLE THINGS YOU GET STRNAD ON A BLITZ AND HERBERT. >> Al: HERBERT 11 OUT OF 12, FIRES NEXT WITH ONLY HIS SECOND INCOMPLETION. HE'S HIT EIGHT DIFFERENT RECEIVERS >> Kirk: WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO THE PREVIOUS PLAY. THERE'S THE BLITZ, AND HERE'S THAT DEEP CROSSER THAT McCONKEY IS SO GOOD AT. LOOK AT HIM THROW RIGHT THROUGH THAT HELPS BEING 6'6" TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT DIDN'T GET A WHOLE LOT ON IT, BUT LOOK AT THE ACCURACY. I'LL TELL YOU, THIS KID IS PLAYING THROUGH AN ANKLE PAIN, GETTING HIT, DEALING WITH IT, AND JUST BATTLING >> Al: 90 SECONDS TO HERE'S THE BLITZ. THEY BEAT WITH A PASS TO McCONKEY WHO HAS TAKEN THAT JUST ABOUT AT THE LINE TO GAIN AND SHOULD BE A FIRST LOCKE AND JONES MAKE THE TACKLE. THEY ALL ALL THE TIMEOUTS LEFT. >> Kirk: YOU MAY WANT TO KEEP AN EYE ON 15. IT'S THE SECOND TIME ON THE LAST FEW PLAYS McCONKEY'S HAD NOBODY ON HIM WITH THESE BLITZES. >> Al: GOING TO RESPOT >> Kirk: LOOKS LIKE REVIEW THE SPOT. >> Al: YEAH. JUST INSIDE THE 27 YARD LINE. SO 107. PREMATURELY MOVE THOSE CHAINS. >> Al: TAKING A LOOK AT THE REPLAY ASSIST. THAT'S 10 AND AN 8 EVENTUALLY. >> Kirk: THEY HAVEN'T BLITZED A LOT IN THIS ENTIRE FIRST HALF, AND THEY'VE BLITZED HERE A FEW TIMES WITH THOSE LINE BACKERS, AND IT'S OPENED UP THAT SECOND LEVEL. AND THEY FOUND McCONKEY A COUPLE TIMES. YEAH, HE LOOKS ABOUT A HALF YARD SHORT. >> Al: SO LET'S -- GOING TO MOVE THE CHAINS BACK. THE CHAINS HAVE BEEN MOVED. SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FIRST DOWN, AND NOW APPARENTLY WITH SOME REPLAY ASSIST UP TOP, NO CHALLENGES IN THE LAST 2 MINUTES. >> Referee: AFTER REVIEW, THE RUNNER WAS SHORT OF THE LINE TO IT'LL BE 3rd DOWN AT THAT SPOT. BY RULE THIS REVERSAL DOES REQUIRE A 10-SECOND RUNOFF. PLEASE SET THE GAME CLOCK TO 1:25, RUN 10 SECONDS DOWN TO 1:15 AND THE CLOCKS WILL START ON MY SIGNAL. 1:15 ON THE GAME CLOCK PLEASE. >> Al: ADVANCED IMPRESSIVE THING IS HE SAID THAT WITH SOME >> Al: NO QUESTION. >> Kirk: WELL, THEY GOT THE CLOCK RIGHT. WE'RE READY TO PLAY BALL HERE. >> Al: WE THINK. SO THAT MAKES IT 3rd DOWN AND INCHES. >> Kirk: GUS EDWARDS, BY THE WAY, LIMPED HE'S BEEN OUT THERE. >> Al: HERBERT'S GOING TO KEEP IT HIMSELF, AND THAT WILL BE A SO 26 YARD LINE. CLOCK CONTINUES TO RUN. TAKEN IT DOWN TO 60 SECONDS, AND INSIDE A MINUTE. >> Kirk: SO IF DENVER KEEPS BLITZING OR IF THEY PULL BACK A LITTLE BIT, VERY GOOD RED ZONE DEFENSE. >> Al: 1st AND 10 FROM THE 26. HERBERT DANCES IN THE INTERCEPTED AT THE GOAL LINE! KRIS ABRAMS-DRAINE WHO HAD A GREAT GAME SUNDAY LAST WEEK OUT AT INDIANAPOLIS AND MISSOURI WITH A GIANT PLAY HERE. >> Kirk: HE'S PLAYING OFF COVERAGE AND HOW GREAT IS THAT? WE TALKED ABOUT THE ROOKIE ON THE OTHER SIDE FOR THE BRONCOS, BO NIX. BUT HOW GREAT IS IT TO BE ABLE TO SEE A ROOKIE WITH YOUR STARTING CORNER RILEY MOSS DOWN, YOU'VE GOT TO TURN TO A ROOKIE. AND WATCH HIS EYES PLAY IN ZONE THE WHOLE TIME, READING THE QUARTERBACK, AND THAT'S WHAT ALLOWS HIM TO GET A JUMP ON THAT HE HAD POSITIONED HIMSELF PERFECTLY, SEE THE FUMBLE, BUT HE HAS PLENTY OF TIME TO GET THE GRIP ON THE BALL. PUTS IT ON THE MONEY, BUT THAT'S ALL ON ABRAMS-DRAINE. READING THE QUARTERBACK, PUTTING HIS BODY IN COMES UP WITH A PICK. HE'S GETTING MORE AND MORE CONFIDENT EVERY SINGLE WEEK HE GETS A CHANCE TO BE OUT >> Al: MADE HIS FIRST START LAST WEEK. AND THAT'S A KILLER FOR THE CHARGERS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE 11 POINTS OR MORE AT THE HALF IF DENVER CAN DO SOMETHING AND THE BRONCOS ARE GOING TO NIX THROWS UNDERNEATH, LOOKING FOR ROOM. THERE IS NONE. TACKLED TO THE 15 YARD CATCH MADE THERE BY JAVONTE WILLIAMS. >> Kirk: YEAH, BRAG ON HIM ABOUT HOW HE DOESN'T TURN THE BALL OVER. YOU MENTIONED IT EARLY IN THE BROADCAST. WHAT, IT WAS WEEK 2 HIS FIRST PICK OF THE YEAR? AND THEN LAST WEEK HE THREW HIS SECOND, AND NOW TONIGHT A BIG ONE. >> Al: AND DENVER PRETTY CONTENT TO LET THAT CLOCK RUN ALL THE WAY DOWN. A COUPLE OF SHORT THROWS HERE. WILLIAMS THE INTENDED RECEIVER, 13 SECONDS. 3rd DOWN AND 13. SO NIX IN THE HALF. 15 OF 21. 155 YARDS THROWN FOR A COUPLE OF TOUCHDOWNS UNLESS SOMEONE TAKES A THAT'S GOING TO TAKE US TO -- >> Kirk: JIM HARBAUGH IS GOING TO CALL A TIMEOUT BECAUSE OF THAT INCOMPLETION. HE MOVED DOWN JUST IN CASE THEY DID. LITTLE BIT SURPRISE. FELT DENVER WAS TRYING TO WORK THE CLOCK WITH A COUPLE EASY PASSES. FIGURED WHY NOT, MAYBE WE'LL BLOCK A KICK, MAYBE WE'LL GET A RUN >> Kirk: YEAH, HE'S RIGHT THERE READY TO GO. HE SEES THE RUN, ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME THAT >> Al: HEY, CRAZIER THINGS HAVE HAPPENED. >> Kirk: NO DOUBT. >> Al: SO YOU'VE GOT DIXON IN FOR THE PUNT. DERIUS DAVIS, WHO'S DANGEROUS, IS BACK. CHARGERS TRY TO SETUP A RETURN. FAIR CATCH IS CALLED FOR. HE GOES DOWN, BALL IS LOOSE. WHATEVER HAPPENS HERE WITH THE FLAG DOWN, THE CLOCK GOES TO TRIPLE ZEROS. AND THE BRONCOS THINK -- >> Kirk: THEY SHOULD GET AN UNTIMED DOWN THE GUNNER RAN INTO THE RETURNER. >> Al: AND IF SO -- WE'LL HEAR MARTIN'S CALL HERE IN A SECOND. GIVE IT TO DENVER AN UNTIMED DOWN, YOU GET A CHANCE AT A FIELD GOAL. >> Kirk: YEAH, I MEAN, 15 YARDS HERE. >> Al: TERRY, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING HERE? >> IT IS FAIR CATCH INTERFERENCE, AND IT'S A 15-YARD PENIMENT. WE'LL GET AN UNTIMED DOWN, AND L.A. WILL HAVE TWO OPTIONS. THEY CAN EITHER SNAP THE BALL OR THEY CAN DO A FREE KICK FOR A FIELD GOAL, WHICH WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN FOREVER. >> Kirk: WE JUST SAID CRAZY THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN HERE. >> Al: AND YOU'RE RIGHT, WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT FREE KICK IN YEARS. SO ARE THEY GOING TO MOVE THE BALL, THEY'RE ON THE MARCH RIGHT >> Kirk: HERBERT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING OUT >> Al: PENALTY WAS ON TRE'MON SMITH. THE BALL IS GOING TO BE SPOTTED AT THE 47. YOU'LL BE LOOKING AT IT, IF YOU WANTED TO KICK A FIELD GOAL, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE 65 >> Kirk: YEAH. THE OFFENSE IS OUT THERE, AND YOU THINK OF YOUR -- >> Referee: OUT BY THE 30 SECONDS. >> Al: SO, OF COURSE, YOU'VE GOT THE PICKET FENCE BACK THERE FOR DENVER AT THE GOAL SO YOUR OPTION IS HAIL MARY OR A FREE KICK. TERRY, WHAT ARE YOU >> YES. SO IF THEY DO A FAIR CATCH KICK, THEY'RE GOING TO KICK FROM WHERE THE BALL IS RIGHT NOW, FROM THE 47 TO MAKE IT A 57-YARD KICK. AND THEY'LL LINE UP JUST AS THEY WOULD ON A FREE KICK. CAN'T BE BLOCKED, BUT THEY CAN CERTAINLY KICK FROM WHERE IT IS RIGHT NOW. >> Kirk: YOU THINK JIM HARBAUGH KNOWS THAT? SOMEBODY BETTER TAP HIM ON HIS SHOULDER. I THINK HE'S GETTING THAT EXPLANATION RIGHT YOU JUST DON'T SEE THIS HAPPEN, LIKE YOU SAID, VERY OFTEN. >> Al: NO. >> Kirk: I WAS WITH YOU, I'D ASSUME THE BALL RIGHT THERE. >> Al: I'VE OMSEEN ONE RIGHT THERE. >> Kirk: GOOD CALL, TERRY. >> Al: DICKER, THIS WITH WITHIN HIS HIS LONG IS 59. ESPECIALLY ON A FREE KICK SITUATION. >> Kirk: NOW, IT CAN BE RETURNED. AND IF THE BALL'S LIVE ONCE IT GOES UP IN THE AIR. >> Al: THE LAST TIME ONE OF THESE WAS SUCCESSFUL WAS 1976. >> Kirk: IT WAS YOUR FIRST YEAR ON MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, WASN'T IT? >> Al: 1986. COME ON. YOU'RE MAKING ME OLDER THAN I AM. I SAW THE GAME ON TELEVISION. YOU DID, TOO, FROM YOUR BASSINET. BRONCOS HAVE NOW CALLED A TIMEOUT. >> Kirk: THIS IS COOL. LOOK AT THIS. YOU'RE RIGHT. >> Al: SO IN 1976 RAY WERSHING WAS KICKING FOR ALL OF TEAMS THE CHARGERS AND IT WAS AGAINST BUFFALO AND IT ENDED THE FIRST HALF. >> Kirk: HERE WE GO AGAIN. >> Al: RIGHT. EVERY HALF A CENTURY THIS COMES INTO PLAY. >> Kirk: I MEAN AS MUCH AS THESE COACHES DO PREP IN OTAs, IN CAMP, HOW MANY COACHES PRACTICE THIS? I MEAN HOW OFTEN DOES THIS EVEN COME UP IN CONVERSATION? >> Al: EVERY 50 YEARS YOU PRACTICE THIS THING. >> Kirk: WATCH HIM PUT THIS THROUGH. THIS WOULD BE A BIG -- >> Al: HE'S 8 OF 9. >> Kirk: LET'S GO PUT IT THROUGH. >> Al: SO J.K. SCOTT'S GOING TO HOLD IT. AND THIS WOULD MAKE IT 21-13 AT THE HALF IF IT'S GOOD. >> Kirk: I MEAN, HE TAKES ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD. THIS IS LIKE WARMUPS. >> Al: MEANWHILE, MARVIN MIMS IS ALL THE WAY BACK IN CASE IT'S SHORT AND HE WANTS TO RUN IT BACK. SO DICKER, THREE YEARS NOW SOLVING CHARGER KICKING WOES FOR SEVEN YEARS PRIOR TO THAT. CAN HE BANG IT THROUGH? ON ITS WAY. IT IS -- YEP! >> Kirk: MADE HISTORY >> Al: YES. >> Kirk: THERE YOU GO. >> Al: TERRY, GREAT PICK UP 3. SEAN PAYTON GOING WHAT DID I DO. AND IT'S 21-13. TRE'MON SMITH WAS THE GUY WITH THE FAIR CATCH INTERFERENCE SETTING THIS BABY UP. AND IT'S AN 8-POINT HALFTIME LEAD FOR THE KAYLEE? >> SEAN, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING AS THAT LAST PLAY UNFOLDED? >> WELL, IT'S A FAIR CATCH FREE KICK SITUATION. WE PRACTICE IT. HE'S GOT THE LEG, AND I THINK, LOOK, THE PENALTY PUT HIM IN RANGE. >> YOUR OFFENSE, HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN WHAT'S ALLOWED IT TO BE SO PRODUCT INTENSIVE. >> WELL, WE'VE HAD PRETTY GOOD BAL BALANCE. OUR THIRD DOWN NUMBERS ARE GOOD. WE STALLED ON THAT LAST DRIVE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE'RE READY TO RUN THE >> THANKS, COACH. WE CAN SEE IT ON YOUR PLAY SHEET. YOU'VE REMINDING YOURSELF. >> Kirk: THEY DO PRACTICE IT. >> Al: I GUESS. 21-13. COMING UP AFTER THE BREAK THE STATE FAR BO NIX IS THROWING THE BALL WELL ESPECIALLY ON THE MOVE. BUT I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THEY GO BACK IN A SECOND HALF TO RELYING ON THAT -- THAT OFFENSIVE LINE AND THE ROTATION OF THE RUNNING BACKS WHERE THEY WERE REALLY DOMINATING THE LINE OF >> Al: TOUCH BACK. DENVER STARTS AT THE >> Kirk: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR STATS POWERED BY AWS. HE LEADS THE NFL IN COMPLETIONS IN YARDS THROWING ON THE RUN HE'S 5 OF 6 ON THE RUN, 6-7 ON THE TWO THE SMILE ON THE SAYS IT ALL. JUST FEELING GOOD, KIND OF IN THAT ZONE. LET'S SEE IF HE CAN KEEP THAT GOING HERE AGAINST THE CHARGERS ON THE OTHER HAND, THE CHARGERS ARE TRYING TO FIND A SPARK TO GET THEIR DAUBERS UP, START FLYING AROUND A BIT MORE. >> Al: START FLYING ON THE GROUND. ONE THINK ABOUT NIX WITH ESMAY PICKING UP 7, BODY LANGUAGE. SOMETIMES WE MAKE TOO MUCH OF IT, BUT YOU SEE NIX AND HE LOOKS LIKE A GUY IN HIS EIGHTH YEAR WHO'S BEEN TO THE SUPER BOWL ONCE OR TWICE. HE JUST HAS THAT LOOK ABOUT HIM. >> Kirk: I STILL GO BACK TO THAT POSITION AS MANY OF THESE COLLEGE QUARTERBACKS THE LAST 30 YEARS, THEY'RE ALL IN A SPRINT TO LEAVE COLLEGE AND GET TO THE NFL. AND YET HERE'S A GUY WHO PLAYED 61 -- HE HAD 61 STARTS IN FIVE AND I THINK THAT EXPERIENCE ALLOWS HIM TO PLAY THE WAY HE IS IN THE NFL. >> Al: STOPPED A YARD SHY. WELL, WITH NIL, THEY'RE NOT IN THAT MUCH OF A SPRINT ANYMORE. >> Kirk: A DISASTER. WHY DON'T WE JOIN THE STUDIO TEAM AND DO A POST GAME? WE CAN DO A COUPLE OF HOURS ON THAT. ALTHOUGH WE'VE GOT MR. BEAST AFTER. >> Al: THE WHOLE >> Kirk: YEAH, WE CAN'T DO THAT. WELL, OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR THE CHARGERS. BIG STOP THERE ON SECOND DOWN. THEY'VE GOT A SHOT HERE ON 3rd DOWN AND SHORT. >> Al: BALL UP AT THE 39 YARD LINE. 3rd AND A LONG YARD. MIMS IS IN THE NIX, CLEAN POCKET. THROWS A STRIKE AND ALL THE WAY TO THE 42 YARD LINE GOES TROY FRANKLIN. SO THE OREGONIANS PLAYED WITH THE DUCKS. >> Kirk: TROYE, 85, CLEARS IT UP. AND NICE OPENING LINE THAT'S THE ROOKIE COLSON OUT NIX SURVEYING, TIMING AND RHYTHM, AGAIN ON POINT. AND THERE'S THAT SMILE >> Al: HE IS HAVING FUN. MIMS AGAIN IN THE TOSS, DROPS IT, PICKS IT UP. IT'S DRAKEN DOWN JUST ABOUT AT THE LINE OF IT'LL BE SECOND DOWN. JUST. EVEN THOUGH HE'S BEEN BACK THERE A HANDFUL OF TIMES THE LAST THREE OR FOUR WEEKS THAT'S JUST A GUY EXCITED TO MAKE A PLAY, TOOK HIS EYE OFF THE FOOTBALL, STARTED TO LOOK WHERE HE WAS GOING TO GO BEFORE HE -- BEFORE HE BROUGHT IT IN. THEY'VE BEEN PRETTY FLAWLESS FOR MOST OF THEIR EXECUTION. LOOK AT THE HEAD RIGHT HE JUST ASSUMED HE WOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT BALL. AND NORMALLY HE WAS. HE HAS GREAT HANDS, BUT JUST GOT AWAY FROM >> Al: ON 2nd AND 12. FLEAFLICKER, MIMS, BACK TO NIX. CAUGHT AT THE 41 YARD LINE IT'S TRAUTMAN. ADAM TRAUTMAN PLAYED WITH SEAN PAYTON FOR HIM AT NEW ORLEANS. SHORT GAIN THERE. >> Kirk: GOOD JOB BY TONY JEFFERSON AND DERWIN JAMES. REMEMBER, THESE GUYS, JAMES HAS PLAYED A LOT OF FOOTBALL. BUT THIS IS JUST TESTING THE DISCIPLINE OF THOSE SAFETIES. THEY TAKE AWAY A LOT OF SHOTS DOWNFIELD, SO NIX'S ONLY CHOICE IS TO CHECK IT COUNSEL. GOOD JOB AGAIN. TONY JEFFERSON WAS IN THE SCOUTING DEPARTMENT LAST YEAR, RETIRED FROM FOOTBALL. AND CAME BACK THIS YEAR AND WITH THE INJURIES HE'S OUT THERE PLAYING. >> Al: TENTH SEASON IN THE NFL. 3rd DOWN AND 7. EXTRA PRESSURE, PASS IS CAUGHT, BUT HE CANNOT PICK UP THE SO ADKINS MADE THAT GRAB. IT'S 4th DOWN. MAKING THE TACKLE IT'LL BE 4th AND 2. >> Kirk: SEE THE SEAN PAYTON DECIDES TO GET AGGRESSIVE, KIND OF IN THAT AREA WHERE A LOT OF TIMES YOU'LL SEE COACHES WITH THE ANALYTICS AT IT THAT 35, 40 YARD LINE. ESPECIALLY THE CONFIDENCE THEY HAVE RIGHT NOW IN THEIR SCHEME, HE IS GOING TO GO FOR IT. >> Al: AT LEAST LINE UP TO. IT WOULD BE A 53-YARD FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT. DO THEY GO? THREE RECEIVERS SET TO THE RIGHT. PLAY CLOCK AT 2. PASS IS CAUGHT, AND TO THE 30 YARD LINE GOES COURTLAND SUTTON. >> Kirk: HE KNEW WANTED TO GO WITH THAT HE MOTIONS 45, ADKINS, IN THERE TO GIVE HIM THAT EXTRA BLOCKER, AND THERE HE IS ALREADY IN POSITION. NOW YOU JUST GET BEHIND IT. I LOVE THAT HE DIDN'T HESITATE. HE GOT RID OF THAT FOOTBALL IN A HURRY, KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED. QUICKLY GOT THE BALL OUT THERE, AND PRETTY EASY FOR COURTLAND SUTTON WITH THE ADVANTAGE THEY HAD WITH THE BIG FULLBACK AND THE TIGHT END OUT IN FRONT. >> Al: GREAT DESIGN ON A 4th AND 2. BURTON THE FALL BACK, ESTIME BEHIND THE LINE THERE TART MAKES A TACKLE THERE. PICK UP AT 90. >> Kirk: THERE'S OUR DEFENSIVE ALERT. ANY TIME YOU SEE JAMES COME AROUND THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, THIS A GUY THAT COULD BE COMING. IN THIS CASE HE DID COME, AND LOOK AT THE ATHLETIC ABILITY OF HE IS SO GOOD. THAT'S WHERE HE MAKES AN IMPACT OCHBN THE GAME. THAT TIME THEY WALKED HIM UP AND ON FIRST DOWN HE MAKES A DIFFERENCE. >> Al: SUTTON ONE NIX DANCING, NIX THROWING, AND MIMS WAS DOWN THERE, BUT THE COVERAGE WAS TARHEEB STILL COVERING ON THE PLAY. STILL 3rd AND 11 NOW. >> Kirk: IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED END OF FIRST HALF AND NOW THE SECOND HALF THE ANSWER MIMS HAS COME UP WITH IS MORE PRESSURE. HE'S BEEN BLITZING THAT TIME JUST TAYLOR THAT CAME ON THE BLITZ. TRYING TO GET HIM OUT OF THIS RHYTHM HE'S IN. THERE'S JAMES WALKING UP AGAIN. HE'S UP HERE. >> Al: E. YG THE BACK FIELD, GOES FIVE WIDE. HERE'S MIMS, AND MIMS IS TAKEN DOWN AT THE 23 YARD LINE. SO IT'S TONY JEFFERSON AGAIN MAKING THAT YOU'VE GOT A 4th DOWN AND 3. GOING TO KICK IT THIS TIME. >> Al: IN COMES THE FIELD GOAL GROUP. >> Kirk: MAYBE GET THE POINTS BACK THAT THEY LOST THE END OF THE FIRST HALF. REALLY THEIR OWN PLAY CALLING OPENED UP THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CHARGERS READY TO GO IN AT HALF. AND THEN WITH THAT INCOMPLETE PASS, STOP THE CLOCK AND USE A >> Al: HARBAUGH CALLED A TIMEOUT AND SAID WHY NOT, WHAT DO WE HAVE TO LOSE? BLOCK, A RUN BACK, MAYBE A FREE KICK EVERY 50 YEARS. THIS KICK BY LUTZ IS U DON'T MEET COACHES AS ENTHUSED ABOUT THE SPORT AS HARBAUGH >> Al: YEAH, HE'S USED TO THESE RECLAMATION PROJECTS. REMINDS ME A LOT OF LARRY BROWN IN BASKETBALL. EVERYWHERE LARRY WENT, HE TURNED IT AROUND. COLLEGE, PRO. >> Al: AND THIS ONE IS A TOUCH BACK. SO WHAT'S AT STAKE IN THIS GAME TONIGHT? IF DENVER WINS, THEY'RE IN THE PLAYOFFS. FIRST PLAYOFF THEY'VE WON SINCE THE SUPER BOWL BACK IN '15 WITH PEYTON MANNING AND COMPANY. CHARGERS WIN THEY DON'T MATHEMATICALLY CLENCH BUT 97% CHANCE. EVEN WITH A LOSS WITH A TWO-GAME ADVANTAGE WITH THE TEAMS OUT OF THE WILD CARD PICTURE RIGHT NOW, STILL THREE QUARTERS OF A CHANCE, 74% TO GET TO POST-SEASON. HERBERT THROWS. SO HERE'S A STORY. DAN FOUSER'S WATCHING THE GAME. WE TALKED ABOUT DAN BEFORE. HE CALLS OUR INFORMATION GURE INFORMATION GURUIN THE TRUCK AND SAID THAT KICK IN '76 HE HAD TO CONVINCE TOMMY, THE COACH IN '76. IT WAS LEGAL. DAN FOUCH, WE ASSUME DAN IS NOT FIBBING TO GETS CREDIT FOR IT. THAT? WE KEEP TAKING THAT STORY -- TAKING IT FORWARD A LITTLE BIT. >> Al: JUST EMBELLISH IT LIKE CRAZY. THERE YOU GO, DAN. 2nd AND 4. FROM THE 36. OFF THE FAKE. HERBERT DANCING, LOOK AT HIM GO! TO THE 45 YARD LINE. BAD WHEEL AND ALL 20 >> Kirk: BUT WE KNOW HOW ATHLETIC HE IS WHEN HE'S HEALTHY. THIS IS JUST DETERMINATION AND TOUGHNESS. THERE'S NOBODY -- NOBODY OPEN DOWNFIELD. CHECK DOWN'S NOT THERE, SO HIS INSTINCTS TAKE OVER. CODY BARTON TRYING TO SWIPE AT THE FOOTBALL, BUT THIS GUY IS -- HE'S A BIG MAN. WHEN HE TAKES OFF, HE'S 6'6", 235 POUNDS AND CAN GO. >> Al: CDIT HIM WITH AN 18-YARD SCAMPER. NO HOLD THERE FOR VIDAL AS HE'S TAKEN DOWN A COUPLE OF YARDS PAST THE LINE OF 2nd AND 8. IT'S ONE THING TO GET THROUGH THE WEEK OF PRACTICE AND THE ANKLE'S NOT FEELING GOOD, BUT YOU GET OUT HERE, YOU GET THE COMPETITIVE JUICES GOING. YOU'RE DOWN AT 11, CLOCK'S TICKING DOWN YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE A THIS IS WHY HIS TEAM RESPECTS HIM SO MUCH AND WHY JIM HARBAUGH TALKS SO GLOWLY ABOUT IT'S NOT JUST HIS PHYSICAL ABILITY. >> Al: RUNNING BACK. McCONKEY INSIDE. OFF THE FAKE, FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE. CAUGHT AND FINDING HIS WAY FOR THE FIRST DOWN, TUCKER FISK, ONE OF THE THREE TIGHT ENDS ACTIVE TONIGHT. SO HE MAKES HIS FIRST GRAB OF THE NIGHT. AND HERBERT IS REALLY SPRINTING AROUND. THAT'S NINE DIFFERENT RECEIVERS, NINE. LINE BACKERS AND THE SAFETIES. LOOK HOW THEY JUST SINK. THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE ANY THREATS AWAY DOWNFIELD, KIND OF PUTTING A SHELL ON THE AND WE'VE SEEN BO NIX WITH A LOT OF THESE MOVES. ZACH ALLEN JUST MAKING SURE. JUST A LITTLE FRIENDLY TAP THERE ON THE FOLLOW THROUGH. BUT WE'VE SEEN BO NIX DO IT. AND NOW WE'VE SEEN HERBERT WITH CHECK DOWNS FOR FIRST DOWN YARDAGE. >> Al: VIDAL, HE'S GOING TO BE TAKEN DOWN FROM BEHIND FROM BE BEHIND. THAT'S ZAC ALLEN REACHING AROUND, STOPPING HIM IN HIS TRACKS. GUY IS ONE OF THE UNDERRATED PLAYERS IN THE ENTIRE NFL. WATCH THE GET OFF. WE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE PLAYED WITH J.J. ALLEN WHEN THEY WERE WITH THE CARDINALS TOGETHER. HE LEARNED A LOT I THINK THE ADDITION OF MALCOLM ROACH, JOHN FRANKLIN-MYERS HAS REALLY HELPED HIM WITH D.J. JONES. YOU LOOK AT THE YEAR HE'S HAD. HE'S SECOND ON DEFENSIVE TACK LDS WITH PASS RUSHING BUT HE'S JUST AS GOOD AGAINST THE RUN. >> Al: TAKING MORE SNAPS, 804, COMING INTO THE GAME THAN ANY OTHER IN THE NFL. TAKING IT TO THE 14. THEY GO TO STONE SMARTT, THE TIGHT END. UNDER 5 TO GO IN THE THIS AT 15. >> Kirk: THIS A GREAT JOB OF IMPROVISING BY ONCE HE ROLLS OUT, I THOUGHT HE MIGHT LOOK TO GET THE BALL TO McCONKEY. BUT McKAUPGY BUT McKACONKEY TAKES A COUPLE OF DEFENDERS WITH HIM AND OPENS IT UP TO SMARTT. >> Al: GOOD CHOICE OF WORDS FROM SMARTLY TO SMARTT. LOOK OUT, HERBERT, DOWN HE GOES. BIG SACK. TILLMAN RIGHT THERE. TILLMAN WITH A SACK. 2nd AND 20. IS WHAT HE LOVES ABOUT THE PRESSURE, THE DEPTH THAT HE HAS. THAT'S THE FOURTH SACK THIS YEAR BY BIG NUMBER 92. BONITTO AND COOPER AND ELLISS GET A LOT OF ATTENTION. BUT HE'S GOT FOUR GUYS WHO CAN PRESSURE THE QUARTERBACKS. >> Al: THEY LEAD THE LEAGUE IN SACKS. HERBERT THROWS, CAUGHT, SPINNING, AND YOU'VE GOT FIVE WHITE SHIRTS TAKING CARE OF McCONKEY AT THAT SPOT AT THE 19 3rd AND 14. >> Kirk: THERE'S VANCE JOSEPH, DEFENSIVE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT A BIT TONIGHT, ONE OF THE BEST IN THE EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT THAT GAME IN MIAMI. SINCE THAT MIAMI GAME, THIS DEFENSE HAS TURNED THE CORNER AND HAS PLAYED LIKE A DIFFERENT OUT FIELD, WITH CONFIDENCE ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR. STEPPING UP, AWAY FROM HERE HE GOES AGAIN. GETS HIT AT THE END OF THE PLAY, AND THERE'S THE FLAG. JUSTIN STRNAD CAME IN LATE. THETS FIRST DOWN. >> Kirk: IT'S NOT HOW PHYSICAL, HOW AGGRESSIVE IT IS. STRAND STRNAD HE GIVES HIMSELF UP. >> Al: THEY'RE GOING TO DISCUSS WHETHER THEY WANT TO PICK THE FLAG UP OR NOT. THEY DON'T. >> Kirk: I DON'T THINK ANY TIME -- THIS IS A BETTER LOOK AT IT RIGHT HERE. ANY TIME YOU SEE A QUARTERBACK, AGAIN, GIVE HIMSELF UP LIKE THAT, STRNAD, HE'S FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THEY HIT HIM THAT HARD, BUT HE WAS DOWN, KNEE WAS DOWN. YOU FOLLOW THROUGH LIKE THAT, THAT'S A PENALTY. >> Al: TRYING NOT TO, YEAH. YOU'RE IN NO-MAN'S-LAND AT THAT >> Kirk: BY THE WAY, THAT WAS GOING TO BE FOURTH DOWN. INSTEAD 1st AND GOAL. EDWARDS IN IS IN EDWARDS FINDS SPACE. TOUCHDOWN, CHARGERS. 24-19, HARBAUGH SAYING LET'S GO FOR 2 TO MAKE IT A 3-POINT GAME. SO A HUGE PERSONAL FOUL CALLED, SETS HIM INSTEAD OF GOING FOR 3, THEY'RE GOING TO GET 7. GREAT BLOCK BY PIPKINS, FISK LEADING REALLY NICE JOB ADJUSTING BY THE BRONCOS DEFENSE. BOTH THOSE GUYS HAD GOOD BLOCKING ANGLES AND A GOOD READ BY EDWARDS TO GET IT INTO THE END ZONE. >> Al: EDWARDS THE BACK, JAUNSSON TO THE LEFT, PALMER TO THE RIGHT, McCONKEY IN THE LEFT SLOT TO THE EDWARDS IN MOTION. KEEP IT. AND DOES HE GET TO THE GOAL LINE? HE DOES NOT! NIK BONITTO IS RIGHT THERE HAVING A TREMENDOUS SEASON AND MAKES A BIG, BIG PLAY. >> Kirk: YOU'RE RIGHT. BONITTO IS THE PASS RUSHER, RIGHT? THIS GUY GETS OFF OF A BLOCK BY ONE OF THESE BIG FULL BACKS, 42, FISK, AND GETS DOWN AND MAKES THE PLAY. STARTS NEXT OCTOBER. SoFi STADIUM OPENED IN 2000. DID THE FIRST GAME HERE WITH CHRIS COLLINSWORTH. NO FANS, COVID YEAR. RAMS AND THE DALLAS COWBOYS. $1.5 BILLION STADIUM. MEANWHILE, IF THE SEASON ENDED RIGHT NOW, AND IT WON'T JUST IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING HERE'S HOW THE WILD CARD MATCH WOULD. BRONCOS GO TO PITTSBURGH TO PLAY STEELERS AND RAVE RNZ WOULD PLAY THE TEXANS IN THE MATCHUP. A LOT CAN HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW AND THEN, BUT THE BRONCOS CAN CLENCH A SPOT TONIGHT. YOU'VE GOT BALTIMORE AND PITTSBURGH GOING BACK AND FORTH, YOU KNOW, AND -- AND DOES KANSAS CITY KEEP THE NUMBER ONE SEED. >> Kirk: WHETS YOUR APPETITE AND GETS YOU EXCITED WHAT COULD BE HERE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. >> Al: FROM THE 30 START THIS DRIVE WITH A LOSS BEHIND THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AS BLAKE WATSON GOES NOWHERE. TO THE FIELD TO KAYLEE. >> GUYS, JUSTIN HERBERT WAS GETTING A CUT ON HIS RIGHT ELBOW TENDED TO. HE'S TREATING IT LIKE IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN A PAPER CUT, I WOULD SAY. THE BIGGER PROBLEM FOR THE CHARGERS DEFENSE, THOUGH, IS THAT LINEBACKER DENZEL PERRYMAN IS RETURN. WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE HE WENT INTO THE LOCKER ROOM DURING HALF TIME. TONIGHT WAS HIS FIRST GAME BACK AFTER MISSING FOUR GAMES WITH A GROIN INJURY. IT'S ACTING UP AGAIN. >> Al: YEAH, HADN'T ONCE TONIGHT WHEN HE WAS OUT THERE. LITTLE SWING PASS, AND 3rd AND 8 COMING >> Kirk: NOW THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE FLYING AROUND A LITTLE BIT, PLAYING WITH A DIFFERENT ENERGY, BIG OPPORTUNITY. THE CROWD'S BACK INTO KIND OF 50-50 SPLIT OF THE CROWD, BY THE WAY. IT'S ALWAYS A BIG STORY ANY TIME THERE'S A HOME GAME FOR THE A LOT OF BRONCOS FANS HERE IN TOWN. BUT RIGHT NOW THESE CHARGERS FANS ARE MAKING A LOT OF NOISE ON THIS THIRD DOWN. AND RAMS ALL PRACTICE SILENT COUNTS FOR HOME GAMES. 3rd AND 8. NIX THROWING, CONTESTED, AND WHO'S GOT IT? A FIGHT FOR THE BALL. YOU'VE GOT JAMES, YOU'VE GOT WILLIAMS. CHARGERS THINK THEY HAVE IT. DERWIN JAMES CAME UP WITH THAT. AS THEY HIT THE GROUND, HE WAS TAKING THAT FOOTBALL >> Al: CLAY MARTIN IS WHAT'S HE GOING TO TELL US? WHO'S GOT IT? MARTIN, HE PATS JAMES. >> Kirk: BUT HE GAVE THAT TO THE BRONCOS. I'LL TELL YOU, WHEN THEY HIT THE GROUND, IT SURE LOOK LIKE LIVE THAT HE DID A GOOD JOB OF STEALING THAT FOOTBALL, FIGHTING FOR LET'S SEE. HERE'S A GOOD LOOK AT THAT. SEE THAT, WELL, MAYBE WILLIAMS STILL HAD IT. MAYBE HE USED HIS STRENGTH TO KEEP IT AWAY FROM HIM. >> Al: TIE GOES TO THE RUNNER. RILEY DIXON. PLOPS IT OUT OF BOUNDS JUST AROUND THE 20 SO 45 SECONDS ARE LEFT IN THE PENULTIMATE QUARTER, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS NEXT TO LAST. AND IT'S 24-19. SEASON. TAKE A LOOK, AL, AT OUR NEXT GEN STATS JUSTIN HERBERT, HE'S SECOND IN THE ENTIRE LEAGUE WHEN IT COMES TO PLAY ACTION. YOU CAN SEE 10-10 ENTERING THIS DRIVE UTILIZING PLAY ACTION AND GETTING INTO THAT RHYTHM THAT HE FINDS WITH THAT LOOK. >> Al: OFF THE FAKE, DANCING, THROWING, CAUGHT ON THE RUN. THAT'S JOSHUA PALMER. WE HAD A LOOK AT THAT ARM, THAT ELBOW. KAYLEE CALLED IT A BRUSH BURN. SO THE ANKLE SEEMS TO BE FINE AND THE ELBOW SEEMS TO BE FINE AT LEAST RIGHT NOW ON THIS FIRST PASS. >> Kirk: AND SO DOES THE PASS PROTECTION. HE WORKED THROUGH HIS PROGRESSTIONS. IT WAS ALMOST LIKE WATCHING A VIDEO GAME. YOU'RE WATCHING HIM SIT BACK THERE AND JUST THREW AN ABSOLUTE LASER RIGHT ON THE MONEY. NOW 11-11 OFF OF THAT PLAY ACTION LOOK. >> Al: AND 17 OF 20 WHICH IS 89% ON THE NIGHT FOR 184 YARDS. SECONDS OF THE QUARTER AND TAKE THE BALL OUT TO THE 39 YARD LINE AND THAT'S WHERE WE'LL START THE FOURTH QUARTER ON THIS THURSDAY NIGHT WITH >> Al: NO MATTER THE OUTCOME OF THIS ONE THOSE THREE TEAMS AT THE TOP, RANGERS, BRONCOS, CHARGERS IN GREAT SHAPE TO GET TO MEANWHILE COLTS, DOLPHINS, AND BENGALS SITTING ON THE OUTSIDE NEEDING A LOT OF HELP. >> Kirk: KANSAS CITY YOU NEVER KNOW WITH MUHOLD IF THEY MIGHT REST HIM. STILL YOU RATHER TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS >> Al: SURE, AL MICHAELS, KIRK HERBSTREIT, KAYLEE HARTUNG. HERE WE GO ON A FOURTH QUARTER ON 2nd AND 6 AS THE CHARGERS HAVE THE BALL ON THEIR 38 ADKINS, THROWING, THERE'S A FLAG DOWN. JONATHAN COOPER CAME CLAY MARTIN WAS RIGHT >> Kirk: THEY GOT HIM WITH A HORSE COLLAR COOPER CHASING FROM BEHIND. >> Referee: PERSONAL FOUL HORSE COLLAR TACKLE, DEFENSE NUMBER 0. 15-YARD PENALTY. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. >> Kirk: ANY TIME YOU'RE CHASING FROM BEHIND AND YOU REACH UP HIGH, YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING YOU CAN NOT TO GRAB HOLD OF THAT JERSEY AND PULL THAT GUY DOWN, BUT THAT'S WHAT HE DID. THAT IS A BIG FIRST THEY'RE CROSS MIDNLD NOW AFTER THAT >> Al: BIG PENALTY AT THE END OF THE HALF TO SETUP THAT FREE KICK. NOW THIS ONE MOVES THE BALL TO THE DENVER SIDE OF THE 50-YARD THE 47 YARD LINE. FIVE PENALTIES AGAINST DENVER TONIGHT, ONLY ONE ACCEPTED AGAINST THE CHARGERS. FROM THE PISTOL. OFF THE FAKE, STEPPING UP, THROW'S UNDERNEATH. KNOCKED DOWN TO THE HERBERT HAS A LOT OF PASSES BATTED DOWN. >> Kirk: YEAH, YEAH. I WAS GOING TO SAY WE'VE TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT DENVER'S OFFENSIVE LINE. YOU KNOW, THE BRONCOS, YOU SAID EARLIER THEY LEAD THE NFL IN SACKS. ONLY ONE SACK TONIGHT. FOR THE MOST PART HE'S BEEN PRETTY CLEAN AND THAT'S BEEN SUCH AN EMPHASIS FROM GREG ROMAN. IT'S, LISTEN, WE HAVE ONE OF THE BEST QUARTERBACKS IN THE HE NEEDS TIME AND HE NEEDS SPACE, AND THEY'VE GIVEN IT TO HIM TONIGHT. AGAIN UNDER PRESSURE, GETS THE PASS AWAY. THERE'S A FLAG AS WE SEE ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE FIELD. VIDAL TACKLED THERE BY CODY BARTON. THAT WAS A 2nd AND 10 CHARGERS ARE FOR THE MOMENT SEEMING TO BACK BUT, NO, IT'S GOING TO BE OFFSIDE. NOW HE WANTS TO KNOW -- DEFENSE NUMBER 99. >> Kirk: ZACH ALLEN IS BEING CLOSE. SOMETIMES YOU SEE THIS OFFENSIVE TACKLES, THEY GET AWAY WITH IT. ZACH ALLEN HAS GOTTEN OFF WITH ONE OR TWO. HE HAD SUCH GOOD GET OFF, THAT TIME MAYBE A LITTLE BIT PREMATURE. >> Al: SO THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT A 2nd AND 5 WITH THE BALL AT THE 42 YARD LINE. VIDAL. RUNS INTO THE ZONE AND MATLOCK. DENVER WITH GOOD PRESSURE THAT TIME STOPPING HIM, GOOD RUN, STOPPAGE AT THE 5. >> Kirk: HE'S BEEN WHAT VANCE JOSEPH WOULD TELL YOU ONE OF THE BIG SURPRISES GREG ROMAN AND HIS OFFENSE HAS HAD TO DEAL WITH. VANCE JOSEPH SAYING, LISTEN, WHEN WE LOST SINGLETON WE WERE TERRIFIED. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS DEFENSE AND HOW WE'VE IMPROVED, NUMBER 40 HAS MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR US. MADE A GREAT PLAY >> Al: HASKINS COMES IN AS THE THIRD DOWN BRONCOS LOOK LIKE THEY'RE COMING. EIGHT GUYS UP AT THE HERE THEY COME. PASS IS THROWN AND CAUGHT, AND A FLAG IS DOWN AT THE 43 YARD >> Kirk: I ALWAYS WONDER IF THEY LINED UP IN THE NEUTRAL ZONE AS A DEFENSE. THEY HAD EVERYBODY UP >> Al: THEY DID. CATCH MADE BY JOHNSTON. >> Referee: OFFSIDE, DEFENSE NUMBER 92 LINING UP IN THE NEUTRAL ZONE. PENALTY IS DECLINED. >> Kirk: THINK THESE MISTAKES THAT ARE COSTING THIS BRONCOS TEAM. END OF THE FIRST HALF THEY GAVE THE 3 POINTS, DECLINED THIS BUT STILL, YOU'D LIKE TO AVOID HELPING THE CHARGERS OUT. THEY GOT THE MOMENTUM >> Al: THAT ONE WAS CALLED ON TILLMAN. HE HAD THE PERSONAL FOUL EARLIER ON COOPER. 1:30 INTO THE FOURTH. CLEAN POCKET. THROW IS CAUGHT. McCONKEY, PUNTS IT BACK TO THE 23 YARD LADD McCONKEY WHAT A DIFFERENCE HE'S HAD THIS CAREER. TRADED KEENAN ALLEN. McCONKEY COMES IN AS THE NUMBER ONE GUY. >> Kirk: THEY LOSE THE MESH CONCEPT AND DELAY BY McCONKEY. GREG ROLLIN' AND HIS OFFENSIVE STAFF THEY DON'T HAVE A TON OF WEAPONS ON THE OFFENSIVE SIDE, BUT THEY'RE COMING UP WITH CREATIVE WAYS TO MAKE SPACE TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO NOT ONLY MAKE CATCHES BUT TO HAVE A CHANCE TO RUN AFTER THE CATCH. >> Al: EIGHT STRAIGHT WITH 50 OR MORE RECEIVING YARDS. THROW'S, CAUGHT! TOUCHDOWN, DERIUS DAVIS. AND THE CHARGERS TAKE THE LEAD ON A 19-YARD TOUCHDOWN PASS. >> Kirk: AL, I JUST TALKED ABOUT GREG ROMAN COMING UP WITH WAYS TO FIND MATCHUPS. AND HERE'S THE MOTION WATCH THE DEFENSE REACT LATE. EVENTUALLY 6, P.J. LOCKE COMES DOWN, BUT THIS IS ALL JUSTIN WITH THAT GIMPY ANKLE I THINK HE WAS THINKING ABOUT FINDING THE BALL LAST MINUTE. HE LOCATES HIS OPEN RECEIVER AND MAKES THE THROW TO DERIUS DAVIS. WHAT A GUTTAE EFFORT AGAIN BY THE QUARTERBACK HERBERT. >> Al: DAVIS WITH HIS FIRST CAREER RECEIVING TOUCH DOWN HAD ONE ON A PUNT RETURN, SECOND YEAR OUT OF TCU. HASKINS IN THE FAKE TO HIM. HERBERT STEPS UP, THROWS, AND IS IT ONE-HANDED CAUGHT? YES, IT IS. JOSHUA PALMER WITH AN AMAZING CATCH. GO DANCE ALONG THE BACK LINE, REACH UP ONE HAND, HAULS IT IN. >> Kirk: HOW ABOUT HE BATS THE BALL UP TO HIMSELF. HE'S BEEN WAITING TO HAVE A CHANCE TO HAVE AN IMPACT AND MAKE A PLAY TO HELP THESE GUYS OUT. THERE'S JIM HARBAUGH GIVING HIM A HUG. LOOK, TAPS, LEANS, GETS HIS FEET DOWN. >> Al: AMAZING. 3-POINT L.A. LEAD. >> Al: HERE IT IS IT'S HERBERT. HE'S GOING TO GET IT TIPPED AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE BARELY. >> Kirk: THAT'S GREAT EFFORT BUT THIS AMAZING CONCENTRATION. LOOK AT THIS BALL, TIPPED BY STRNAD. MAKES THAT MUCH MORE IMPRESSIVE AND THE CONCENTRATION AND 2-POINTER BY PALMER. >> Al: ALMOST EVERY WEEK AND EVERY GAME WE SEE AMAZING CATCHES. ODELL BECKHAM, HE BROKE THE SEAL ON ALL THIS STUFF BACK IN 2014. >>> BACK AT SoFi STADIUM. 12:23 LEFT IN THE FOURTH. CHARGERS ON TOP 27-24. DENVER TRYING TO CLENCH A PLAYOFF SPOT. CHARGERS TRYING TO MAKE IT A 97% PROBABILITY WITH A VICTORY. DRIVE STARTING FROM THE 30 YARD LINE. BACK IN THIS TO 5. ESTIME SECOND DOWN. >> Kirk: WE TALKED ABOUT THE DEFENSE AND WHERE'S THE ENERGY. IT'S TWO WEEKS IN A ROW THEY'VE BEEN A LITTLE SLUGGISH. BOY, THEY'VE TURNED THINGS AROUND THE SECOND HALF. THINK ABOUT THE FIRST HALF TO SECOND HALF. LOOK AT THE YARDS. THE DRIVE CHART. DENVER STARTED THIS GAME THEIR FIRST THREE POSSESSIONS TOUCHDOWN, TOUCHDOWN, TOUCHDOWN. SINCE THEN IT'S PUNT, PUNT, FIELD GOAL, AND PUNT. SO THE ADJUSTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE. THE ENERGY IN THIS DEFENSE IS FLYING AROUND HERE THESE LAST FEW POSSESSIONS. >> Al: 2nd AND 5. AND DOWN HE GOES. HE GETS IT AWAY, THE PRESSURE PUT ON BY PRESSURE PUT ON . 3rd DOWN AND 5. >> Kirk: TELL YOU WHAT'S BEEN INTERESTING HERE IS BO NIX HAS NOT BEEN GETTING THE BALL DOWNFIELD AT ALL IN FACT, IF YOU LOOK AT THE AVERAGE DISTANCE TONIGHT, 2.6 AIR YARDS. THAT'S THE SHORTEST BY ANY QUARTERBACK THE ENTIRE YEAR. >> Al: 3rd DOWN AND 5. ONLY A THREE-MAN RUSH. NIX DUMPS IT OFF, CAUGHT, AND TAKING IT OUT TO ALMOST MIDFIELD IS MICHAEL BURTON. SO THE SAFETY. MAKES THE PLAY, PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN. >> Kirk: HENLEY ACTUALLY HAS BURTON OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. DELAY, DELAY. HE LETS HIM GO. JUST FREE RELEASE AND A GOOD JOB BY BO NIX, ALL THIS PRESSURE, LOUD AS THIS STADIUM HAS BEEN ALL NIGHT, AND HE FINDS THAT CHECK DOWN ONCE AGAIN WHO GETS AWAY FROM HENLEY WHO LOST HIS THAT TIME LOOKING FOR NIX AS A THREAT TO POTENTIALLY SCRAMBLE FOR THE FIRST DOWN. >> Al: ROOKIE WATSON IN THE BACKFIELD. PLAY FAKE. GOING DEEP! HAS A MAN, AND IT'S GOING TO BE BROKEN UP AT THE VERY END. INTENDED FOR MIMS. TARHEEB STILL WAS ABLE TO GET BACK THERE. HIGH FLOATER GAVE STILL ENOUGH TIME TO GET BACK AND MAKE THE >> Kirk: YEAH, JUST TALKED ABOUT HOW IT'S BEEN A LOT OF SHORT PROS. THEY'RE SAVING THESE DEEPER SHOTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER, OUT AND UP. AND THE ROOKIE FELL FOR IT. THE BALL IS LATE. IT WAS HIGH IN THE AIR BUT IT WAS LATE, AND THAT'S WHY THE BALL WAS UNDERTHROWN. THAT'S A TOUCHDOWN IF HE SEES IT AND GETS THE BALL OUT EARLY. BECAUSE IT'S LATE, IT GIVES STILL A CHANCE TO CATCH UP ON IT, AND SAYS THAT ONE'S ON ME. NEEDED TO GET IT OUT EARLIER. NEEDED ABOUT 3 OR 4 MORE YARDS ON IT AS WELL. 2nd DOWN AND 10. LEFT SIDE, WILLIAMS STOPPED JUST SHY OF THE 50 YARD LINE BY TULI TUIPOLOTU. >> Kirk: TUIPOLOTU NICE JOB SETTING THAT EDGE. REMEMBER THESE GUYS WERE PUSHED AROUND IN THE RUN GAME IN THE IT'S AMAZING WHEN YOU PLAY THIS GAME WITH ENERGY ON THAT DEFENSIVE SIDE. >> Al: 3rd AND 8. RUSH FIVE. TAKES HIM OUT, THROWS WATSON AND THE WILL GET THE BALL BACK AFTER A 4th AND 8 FOR >> Kirk: DEFENSE KEEP DOING THEIR JOB. TALKING THERE ABOUT AN ADJUSTMENT MAYBE WITHIN A ROUTE WITH BUT NONETHELESS, MAN, THE CHARGERS PLAYING, IT'S SEEING THINGS AND WINNING THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, WHICH THEY COULD NOT DO IN THAT >> Al: NO, THEY MAN HANDLED. DENVER'S HAD NO RUNNING GAME ALL IN THE SECOND HALF. MEANWHILE, DIXON SENDS IT WILL BE CAUGHT BY THE BRONCOS, AND DOWN TO THE 4 YARD LINE. TRE'MON SMITH GOT DOWN NICE PLAY BY HIM. CHARGERS DEEP IN THEIR OWN TERRITORY WITH 9:48 LEFT IN REGULATION INSIDE THE GAME PRESENTED BY PEPSI. PENALTIES, THIS DENVER TEAM HAS BEEN PLAYING SO WELL. THAT'S THE END OF THE FIRST HALF LED TO THE THREE POINTS AND FREE HE SCRAMBLED, HE'S SHORT, BUT A LATE HIT ALLOWS HIM TO KEEP THAT DRIVE ALIVE. THAT WAS A TOUCHDOWN. OHORSE COLLAR, THAT LED TO EVENTUALLY A TOUCHDOWN BY GUS SO SEAN PAYTON'S TEAM WAS IN COMMAND. TWICE THEY HAD AN 11-POINT LEAD. 21-10, 20-13, BUT THEY LOST CONTROL THE END OF THE FIRST HALF AND REALLY A MAJORITY OF THIS SECOND HALF. >> Al: THAT MARINE LAYER COMING IN. SoFi STADIUM HOME OF THE CHARGERS, HOME OF THE RAMS. HOME OF SUPER BOWL 21. HASKINS IS IN THE BACKFIELD AS THE SEND MATLOCK OVER THE
