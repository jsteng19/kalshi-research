PHILADELPHIA. THE EAGLES ARE GOING TO GET THE KICKOFF. AUSTIN SCOTT IS BACK FOR JOSEPH. THE SENDING SKYWARD! -- SKYWARD. AND WE DO IS UNDERWAY IN PHILADELPHIA WITH A TOUCHBACK. OUT OF THE 25 YARD LINE, THE EAGLES. DALEN HURTS SECOND IN THE MBP VOTING LAST YEAR BEHIND ONLY PATRICK MAHOMES. LAST WEEK THOSE WERE HIS NUMBERS IN NEW ENGLAND. THE ONE TOUCHDOWN PASS TO SMITH. HE RAN NINE TIMES. A LOSING CAUSE AT THE SUPER BOWL PERFORMANCE. SWIFT WILL START AT RUNNING BACK. KENNETH STARTED LAST WEEK BUT HE IS AN ACTIVE TONIGHT WITH A INJURY. THEY START WITH A SWIFT, THE FORMER LION, GOING BACK AND FORTH. AND HURTS TO THROW TO THE OUTSIDE. THE 30 -- THE 31 YARD LINE FOR A GAIN OF SIX. NICK SIRIANNI IS IN HIS WORD SEASON AS A PHILADELPHIA HEAD COACH. TOOK THEM TO THE PLAYOFFS IN HIS FIRST YEAR LOSING THE WILD CARD GAME TO TAMPA BAY. AND ALL THE WAY TO THE NFC CHAMPIONSHIP LAST YEAR LOS THREE TO KANSAS CITY IN THE SUPER BOWL. SECOND DOWN AND THREE. PRESSURE. SCRAMBLES AWAY. CAN ONLY GET BACK JUST ABOUT TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN. THIRD DOWN, LET'S CALL IT FOUR. KIRK: THE ROOKIE IS STORY. WE WILL KEEP OUR EYE ON HIM. HE HAS A CHANCE TO HAVE A BIG IMPACT. UNDRAFTED. WE SEE EACH WEEK THESE PLA THAT PLAY WITH A CHIP ON THEIR SHOULDER. THE ROOKIE OUT OF CINCINNATI. THERE IS THAT LOOK, WASTE ALL THAT LAST WEEK FROM THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR. AL: UNDER PRESSURE. CHASING. TAKING DOWN THE -- CLOSING IN ON THE FIRST DOWN. STAYING IN BOUNDS. HUNTER CHASED HIM ALL THE WAY AROUND AND OUT OF THE BACKFIELD BUT HE PICKED UP THE FIRST DOWN. KIRK: LAST WEEK AGAINST TAMPA THEY SHOWED THIS LOOK ON THIRD DOWN. THEY DROPPED OUT AND PLAYED ZONE. THEY PLAY ZONE BEHIND IT THIS TIME BUT THEY ARE PLAYING WITH HE IS ABLE TO GET AWAY AND FIGHT WITH HIS ATHLETIC ABILITY TO GET THAT FIRST DOWN. HUNTER HAD A CHANCE TO BRING HIM DOWN ON THAT THIRD DOWN PLAY. AL: A TIMEOUT IS TAKEN HERE. MEANWHILE, WHAT THEY DID IS THEY TOOK ELLIS OFF THE FIELD. JOSH COMES OFF THE FIELD. THE OFFICIALS CAN STOP THE GAME WHEN THEY SEE THAT SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE REMOVED. WORD IS COMING DOWN ABOUT THAT FROM UPSTAIRS. FROM THE 37 YARD LINE, FIRST QUICK THROW. THEY ONLY THROUGH TO HIM LAST TIME. A MUCH UTILIZED TIGHT END IN THE PAST MAKES COUPLE. KIRK: NICK SIRIANNI AND THE RES OF THE PHILADELPHIA COACHES SAID ENOUGH NOISE IN PHILADELPHIA. GOEDERT DID NOT CATCH A BALL NOR DID SWIFT. RIGHT AWAY THEY WANTED TO GET HIM THE BALL. THE FACT HE HAS THE ABILITY TO PLAY IN LINE AND SPREAD OUT. YOU SAW HIM PLAY OUT IN SPACE BUT THAT WAS GREAT DEFENSE FROM THE VIKINGS. AL: SECOND DOWN AND 11. PLAY-ACTION. GOING DEEP! MAKING THAT CATCH IS DEVONTA SMITH! JACKSON HAD TO ADJUST. SMITH STILL MAKES A GRAB. KIRK: WATCH MURPHY PASS SMITH OFF TO JACKSON WHO JUST CAME IN AND RIGHT AWAY PHILADELPHIA DOWNFIELD. YOU CAN SEE THE SPEED OF SMITH. HE GOES RIGHT BY HIM. HE IS IN FOR A COUPLE PLAYS AND GREAT JOB BY BRI TEST HIM. AL: BROWN. IN AMONGST A BUNCH OF TRAFFIC. JACKSON MAKES THE CAT -- MAKES THE STOP. YOU PAY A PENALTY WHEN YOU MAKE THE SUPER BOWL. BOTH OF YOUR COORDINATORS ARE GONE. BRIAN JOHNSON TAKES OVER AS THEY OFFENSIVE -- AS THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. AND A CHANGE ON THE DEFENSIVE SIDE FOR MINNESOTA, BRIAN FLOREZ COMES IN AS DEFENSIVE SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. SWIFT. DOWN AND GOAL. A GAIN OF ONE. THIRD DOWN AND GOAL. HARRISON PHILLIPS, 97 MIDDLE, MAKES THE STOP. KIRK: BRIAN JOHNSON. HE AND JALEN HURTS TELLING US EARLIER THIS WEEK THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO FIND THEIR RHYTHM. LAST WEEK WAS A TOUGH START ON THE ROAD. OFF THAT LEAD. IT WAS HARD FOR THE THAT ATTACKING STYLE THAT YOU ARE USED TO SEEING. ON THIS FIRST DRIVE YOU CAN SEE THEY WANT TO GET THE DOWNFIELD AND BE AGGRESSIVE. AL: HURTS WILL KEEP IT. HE CUTS TO THE INSIDE AND GETS STYMIED AT THE NUMBER SIX YARD LINE. JUST LIKE LAST WEEK, DEEP DOWNFIELD THEY SETTLE FOR A FIELD GOAL AND JAKE ELLIOTT KICKED FOUR OF THEM LAST SUNDAY. KIRK: IN A GAME LIKE THIS WHERE YOU ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND THE IDENTITY, YOU SEE HURTS WITH HIS ABILITY. BUT TO THE CREDIT OF THE VIKINGS THEY DID NOT LOSE THEIR EDGE. AL: JAKE ELLIOTT MISSED THE EXTRA POINT LAST WEEK BUT HE WAS THE NFC SPECIAL TEAMS PLAYER OF THE WEEK WITH FOUR FIELD GOALS. FROM 24 OUT, DOWN THE MIDDLE. SET UP BY THE LONG PASS TO DAVON TASTE SMITH. le anything! YESTERDAY. IT IS AN INTERESTING STORY. JALEN HURTS GOES TO THE SIDELINE AND HE BROUGHT IT UP IN OUR MEETING YESTERDAY. HE SAID WHEN BRIAN JOHNSON WAS THE QUARTERBACK COACH I COULD TALK TO HIM. NOW WE SEE HIM BACK ON THE SIDELINE TALKING TO JOHNSON AGAIN. AL: HERE COME THE VIKINGS. KIRK COUSINS IN HIS SIXTH SEASON. KIRK: A VETERAN GUY GIVING THEM CONFIDENCE TO COME OFF THE LOSS AGAINST TAMPA BAY. HE HAD THREE TURNOVERS EARLY IN THAT GAME. HE IS THE FIRST GUY TO TELL YOU THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. 35 YEARS OLD. 12TH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE AND NINTH YEAR AS A STARTER. WE WILL SEE HOW THEY TRY TO GUYS OUT. AL: SIX WITH MINNESOTA AND BEFORE THAT, SIX WITH WASHINGTON. THE POCKET IS CLEAN AND THE PAST IS GOOD UP TO THE 40 1-YARD LINE AND JUSTIN JEFFERSON COMING OFF A PHENOMENAL SEASON. THE NFL'S OFFENSIVE PLA THE YEAR. WRITE UP THAT MATCHUP -- RIGHT OFF THE BAT IT IS THE JEFFERSON-SLAY MATCHUP. KIRK: A LOT OF TIMES IT IS JEFFERSON'S ROUTES. THE DEEP CROSSERS. AND THE FIRST PLAY, PLAY ACTION, THEY GIVE HIM ONE WINS THE MATCHUP. AL: HE HAD A FIRST HALF AGAINST TAMPA LAST SUNDAY AND ALMOST NOTHING IN THE SECOND HALF. SLAY IS RIGHT THERE TO TAKEN DOWN AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. KEVIN O'CONNELL IS THE SECOND YOUNGEST COACH IN THE NFL. ONLY SEAN MCVAY IS A YOUNGER. AND HE COMES OFF THE STAFF OF SEAN MCVAY. KIRK: HE WANTS TO GET BIGGER WITH SOME OF HIS GROUPINGS. LAST YEAR THEY HAD A ONE TIGHT END GROUP LOOKUP. HE FEELS HE HAS MORE VERSATILITY MADE. AL: SECOND AND NINE. THE PRESSURE BEGAN TO DEVELOP. INTENDED FOR ALEXANDER MADSEN ALEXANDER MATTISON. THE OFFENSIVE LINE FOR MINNESOTA IS A MAKESHIFT LINE. KIRK: LOOK HOW QUICK YOU SEE SWIFT GET OFF THE BALL. SUCH A GAME CHANGER. THINK ABOUT AN EDGE WORKING AROUND THE TACKLES. THAT BLITZ ALLOWS SWIFT TO GO BACK INSIDE. AL: GOD IS A TERRIFIC AND -- THAT IS A TERRIFIC DEFENSIVE LINE AND DEEP. THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE. THE PASS WAS INTENDED FOR OSBORN, FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: THE PROBLEM IS YOU LEAVE JORDAN DAVIS ALL ALONE ONE-ON-ONE AGAINST CLEVELAND. HE IS BIG BUT REALLY QUICK ESPECIALLY WHEN HE KNOWS IT IS A PASSING DOWN. THE BIG FELLA GETS THERE IN A HURRY. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE THAT THROW WITH 345 POUNDS COMING AT YOU THAT FAST? AL: BRIAN RIGHT -- HIS POND. -- HIS PUNT. DRIFTING. LOSES THE BALL BUT THE ARE RIGHT THERE TO RECOVER AT THE 10 YARD LINE. A FUMBLE. PHILADELPHIA ABLE TO RECOVER AT THE 10 WHICH IS WHERE THEY WILL BEGIN AT THEIR SECOND DRIVE OF THE NIGHT. 3-0 EAGLESLET'S GO DOWNSTAIRS TO KAYLEE: WE HAVE LEARNED VIKINGS DEFENSIVE BACK JOSH METELLUS QUESTIONABLE TO RETURN. AL: HE JUST SIGNED A CONTRACT EXTENSION AND STARTED AGAINST TAMPA BAY. MEANWHILE, THAT PUNT FUMBLE WAS. RECOVERED BY KEELEY RINGO. PHILADELPHIA MAINTAINS POSSESSION. THE PASS TO THE OUTSIDE IS INCOMPLETE. GOEDERT WAS ONLY TARGETED ONE TIME LAST WEEK IN NEW ENGLAND. KIRK: RIGHT AWAY TRYING TO GET HIM INVOLVED. BRIAN FLOREZ TELLING US THAT METELLUS IS A CHESS PIECE BECAUSE HE CAN DO SO MANY THINGS. THEY BROUGHT OVER BRIAN MURPHY FROM ARIZONA BUT THEY ARE STILL FINDING THAT TO BECOME A STRENGTH. IN THE MEANTIME, THE SAFETIES HAVE TO STEP UP. AL: THEY GO TO GOEDERT AGAIN. THREE TIMES, TWO CATCHES. THE DEFENSE IS PROBLEMATIC. THE HAD TO MAKE CHANGES. WORST DEFENSE IN THE LEAGUE. KIRK: THE LAST THREE YEARS HAVE BEEN A TOUGH ASPECT OF THIS FOOTBALL TEAM. I THINK BRIAN FLOREZ BRINGS A MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH WITH HIS BACKGROUND IN NEW ENGLAND. YOU SAW THAT IN THE OPENER AGAINST TAMPA BAY AND YOU WILL SEE THAT TONIGHT. AL: BOSTON SCOTT COMES INTO THE BACKFIELD. REFEREE: FALSE START, OFFENSE, NUMBER 65. FIVE YARD PENALTY, THIRD DOWN. AL: THE FIRST PENALTY CALL OF THE GAME HALFWAY THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER. LANE JOHNSON, THE RIGHT TACKLE. KIRK: BRIAN FLORES HAS A BACKGROUND OF BEING INCREDIBLY CREATIVE, TRIES TO GIVE YOU A LOT OF DIFFERENT LOOKS. HE WANTS TO CONFUSE THE OFFENSIVE LINE. WITHOUT HAVING THOSE GREAT CORNERS, THEY WILL PLAY ZONE. AL: BUNCH THREE RECEIVERS TO THE RIGHT SIDE, HURTS LOOKS THAT WAY, TAKES OFF. HE TAKES A HARD HIT AT THE 14 YARD LINE FROM JORDAN HICKS. IT IS FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: HE IS ABLE TO -- HE HAS A THREE MAN RUSH, IT IS THIRD AND LONG, LET'S TAKE AWAY EVERYTHING RUSHING THREE, LOOK AT ALL THOSE DEFENDERS AND EVERYTHING IS TAKEN AWAY. AS ATHLETIC AS HURTS IS, YOU ARE ABLE TO GIVE THAT UP. A GOOD JOB BY MINNESOTA'S DEFENSE. AL: PUNTING FROM THE GOAL LINE. POWELL COLLECTS AT THE 46 YARD INTO EAGLES TERRITORY. A GOOD RUNBACK BUT HE COUGHS THE BALL UP AND THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES, WAY WITH THE BALL! NICHOLAS MORROW COMES UP THE RECOVERY. KIRK: THAT LOOKED LIKE A HUGE RETURN. A GREAT EFFORT BY EVANS TO GET THE BALL OUT. HOW ABOUT THE HEADS UP PLAY BY MORROW, HE JUMPS RIGHT ON TOP OF IT TO GIVE THE EAGLES THE BALL RIGHT BACK. AL: MINNESOTA DONE IN BY TURNOVERS LAST WEEK, GIVE IT AWAY RIGHT HERE WITH 6:09 LEFT IN THE QUARTER AND THE EAGLES UP, 3-0. KIRK: THEY WERE ABOUT TO START THE DRIVE IN PLUS TERRITORY AT THEY COUGH IT UP. AL: SWIFT IS THE RUNNING BACK. THEY GIVE IT TO HIM. HE PLAYED WITH DETROIT LAST YEAR. TO THE 34 HE HARRISON SMITH. KIRK: WITH KENNY GAIN WEALTH OUT OF THE LINEUP, SWIFT GETS HIS OPPORTUNITY. A LOCAL PRODUCT FROM A GREAT HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAM. AL: AGAIN, SWIFT. THEY LET MILES SANDERS GO, HE GAINED OVER 1000 YARDS AND HE IS NOW WITH CAROLINA. I PREFER WHAT MIKE TOMLIN DISTRIBUTION OF LABOR. KIRK: [LAUGHTER] THEY STILL HAVE THAT. THEY HAVE FOUR DIFFERENT GUYS WHO CAN CARRY THE BALL, WITH GAINWELL OUT, THEY ARE DOWN TO THREE. IT IS NICE. AL: FROM THE 38 YARD LINE. THEY CALL HIS NUMBER AGAIN. SWIFT, A GAIN OF 13 AND A FIRST TACKLED BY HARRISON SMITH. KIRK: THIS PLAY IS DESIGNED TO GO UP HERE BUT A GOOD JOB BY MINNESOTA CLOGGING THAT AND HE IS ABLE TO BOUNCE THIS. LANE JOHNSON TO THE RIGHT. MINNESOTA THINKS THE BALL GOING INSIDE. A NICE JOB WITH THE VISION OF SMITH. HE REALLY CREATED THAT PLAY ON HIS OWN. AL: THE BALL RIGHT ON THE MIDFIELD STRIPE. FOUR CARRIES FOR 24 YARDS FOR THE FIRST YEAR EAGLE. HURTS TAKEN DOWN BY A BEVY OF WHITE SHIRTS. LED BY DANIELLE HUNTER. KIRK: THEY WERE NOT SURPRISED AT ALL, FIRST AND 10 PLAY ACTION. THE ROOKIE LINEBACKER, PACE, WALKED UP TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND AFFECTED THE COMMUNICATION. HUNTER DID A GOOD JOB OF PUTTING PRESSURE OFF THE EDGE. A GROUP EFFORT. BRIAN FLORES DIALING IT UP. NOT FOOLED AT ALL AFTER A COUPLE NICE RUNS BY SWIFT. OFFGUARD. AL: SEVEN YARD SACK. BOSTON SCOTT IN THE BACKFIELD ON A SECOND AND 17. THEY SET UP A SCREEN. NOTHING HAPPENING. GOEDERT MAKES THE CATCH AND THE VIKINGS ARE ON TOP OF HIM. THIRD AND 16 UPCOMING. KIRK: IF YOU ARE A VIKINGS FAN, IT IS ONLY YOUR SECOND TIME TO SEE THIS DEFENSE THIS YEAR. IT IS SUCH A DIFFERENT UNIT WITH BRIAN FLORES AS THE DEFENSIVE IT WAS MORE OF A BEND BUT DON'T BREAK DEFENSE A YEAR AGO AND IT DID NOT WORK OUT. THEY WANTED TO SEE SOMETHING MORE AGGRESSIVE AND THEY BROUGHT IN FLORES. WE ARE GETTING AN IDEA OF WHAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF DOING. AL: THIRD AND 16. HEY THANH OF TIME AND THEN IT IS PICKED OFF BY THE VIKINGS! THAT IS JACKSON. HE GETS UP AND RUNS IT BACK FOR A FEW YARDS, OUT TO THE 42 YARD JACKSON GOT BEAT BY THE LONG PASS TO SMITH, HE ATONES FOR THAT. 3-0 IN THE OPENING QUARTER IN T WEEK, THE MUG LINEBACKER LOOK, JOHNSON IN FOR METELLUS. SHOWING THE PRESSURE. REMEMBER, IT IS THIRD AND 15, THIRD AND FOREVER, AND THIS IS A MISTAKE BY JALEN HURTS. HE DID NOT EVEN SEE HIM. HE PREDETERMINED WHERE TO GO WITH THE FOOTBALL AND IT IS A NICE JOB OF SITTING AND READING THE EYES BY THEO JACKSON. THE FREE SAFETY BYNUM, IF THAT IS NOT PICKED UP BY JACKSON, BYNUM MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE. AL: HURTS WITH ONLY SIX INTERCEPTIONS ALL SEASON LONG LAST YEAR. TWO TICKS UNDER THREE MINUTES TO GO IN THE OPENING FRAME. ALEXANDER MATTISON IS THE RUNNING BACK. FROM THE 35 YARD LINE. AND MATTISON TAKES OVER FOR DELVING COOK AND THE BALL IS OUT! EAGLES THINK THEY HAVE IT. AND -- WE ARE WAITING FOR THE SIGNAL FROM THE OFFICIALS --AND IT IS PHILADELPHIA BALL! RIGHT OFF THE BAT, TWO TURNOVERS. JUSTIN EVANS COMES AWAY WITH IT. KIRK: IT LOOKED LIKE AVONTE MADDOX MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN HIS HAND IN THEIR. IT IS MADDOX WHO GOT HIS HAND ON THE FOOTBALL. EVERYONE WILL WANT TO SEE THIS, TAKE A GOOD, CLOSE LOOK. YES, THE BALL IS OUT. PHILADELPHIA GETS A SECOND TURNOVER. THREE LAST WEEK IN THE FIRST HALF AGAINST TAMPA, TWO ON THE ROAD AGAINST PHILADELPHIA. THEY ARE GIVING THE BALL RIGHT BACK TO THE EAGLES OFFENSE. AL: FIVE IN THE FIRST FIVE QUARTERS OF THE SEASON. A SHORT FIELD NOW. 11 TURNOVERS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OVER THE LAST TWO SEASONS, WORST IN THE LEAGUE. 39 YARD LINE. PHILLY BEGINS THIS DRIVE. HURTS, NOWHERE TO GO. KIRK: WHEN YOU DEFEND THIS OFFENSE, YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE EDGES TO THE DEFENSE. THIS IS A GREAT PLAY. WATCH JORDAN HICKS. YOU CAN WORRY ABOUT THE TIGHT END IN THE FLAT. HE AND HARRISON SMITH, WELL-SCHOOLED IN A SHORT WEEK TO ANTICIPATE THE EXTRA HAT. QUARTERBACK RUN GAME. BOTH ARE IN POSITION TO FORCE HIM BACK INSIDE. AL: ONLY A THREE-MAN RUSH, EIGHT DROPBACK. AJAY BROWN IN THE TRADE OF THE HE HAD A SPECTACULAR SEASON. ABOUT AS GOOD AS IT GETS, BETWEEN BROWN AND JEFFERSON, TWO OF THE ELITE RECEIVERS IN THE LEAGUE. KIRK: THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO HIT THEIR SHOTS DOWN THE FIELD. WE ALREADY SAW DEVONTA SMITH. BACK TO ANOTHER THIRD DOWN FOR THIS PHILADELPHIA OFFENSE. AL: JEFFERSON ON THE OTHER SIDE. I AM JUST SAYING IN THIS GAME. YOU ARE RIGHT AS FAR AS THE TANDEM IS CONCERNED. THIRD AND 5. THE VIKINGS ARE RIGHT THERE JORDAN HICKS MAKES THE STOP. IT IS A RATHER INPATIENT CROWD. KIRK: OBVIOUSLY -- [LAUGHTER] NO MATTER WHAT THE SPORT IS, THIS TEAM WENT TO THE SUPER BOWL LAST SEASON, WE ARE IN WEEK 2 AND THEY ARE ALREADY LETTING THEM KNOW. THEY ARE OFF NOW. THE EXECUTION IS OFF. THIS DEFENSE DESERVES A LOT OF CREDIT. GOOD TO SEE METELLUS BACK IN THERE. TRYING TO RUN A QUARTERBACK COUNTER. AL: 55-YARD ATTEMPT FOR ELLIOTT. THIS ONE IS OFF TO THE RIGHT AND NO GOOD. THEY CANNOT CASH IN AND THE CROWD SAYS, "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FOR ME LATELY?" 42THAT IS OUR GAME, GIANTS-49ERS KIRK: GREAT TO SEE BROCK PURDY BACK AND PLAYING WELL. YOU WOULD NOT EVEN KNOW HE SUFFERED THAT INJURY. AL: ELBOW INJURY. MEANWHILE, COUSINS IS LUCKY HE HANGS ONTO THAT. JOSH OLIVER COLLIDED WITH HIM, THE TIGHT END. MAN, OH, MAN, THEY ARE HAVING A ROUGH TIME GETTING STARTED. KIRK: THEY SURE ARE. THE INTERIOR GOT PUSHED RIGHT BACK INTO COUSINS. AL: SECOND AND 15. THEY MOVE HOCKENSON, THE TIGHT END, INTO THE SLOT. A FLAG IS THROWN, A FREE PLAY. GOING DEEP DOWNFIELD, NOTHING TO LOSE, IT IS INCOMPLETE. THEY HAD SLAY THERE. FLETCHER COX WAS ALMOST INTO THE KIRK: WHY NOT THROW IT UP TO 18? FREE PLAY. AL: THIS WILL TAKE US TO THE END OF THE QUARTER. HERE IS CLAY MARTIN. REFEREE: OFFSIDE, DEFENSE, NUMBER 91. FIVE YARD PENALTY, REMAINS SECOND DOWN. THIS IS THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER. AL: SECOND AND 12 WHEN WE COME HERBSTREIT, KAYLEE HARTUNG. WE START THE SECOND QUARTER AFTER A VERY STRANGE OPENING SECOND DOWN AND 12 AS COUSINS QUICKLY GETS TO THE OUTSIDE. TACKLED AT MIDFIELD BY ADDISON, THE ROOKIE. IT WILL BE THIRD AND 3. KIRK: THAT IS MORE OF WHAT WE EXPECTED TO SEE FROM THIS OFFENSE, BEING ABLE TO GET THE BALL OUT IN A HURRY. ONE OF THE CONCERNS YOU HAVE WITH THIS OFFENSIVE LINE, YOU HAVE A BACKUP LEFT TACKLE, A BACKUP CENTER AND A COUPLE GUARDS STILL TRYING TO FIND THEIR WAY AGAINST ARGUABLY ONE OF THE TOP DEFENSIVE LINES, IF NOT THE TOP, IN THE LEAGUE. AL: PRESSURE ON ALMOST EVERY PLAY. THE LINE DOES A GOOD JOB HERE AND THE PASS IS CAUGHT, THIS TIME BY K.J. OSBORN. IT WAS SECOND AND 17 AND THEY TURNED IT INTO A FIRST DOWN, ONLY THE SECOND OF THE GAME. THEY COME UP NO-HUDDLE. KIRK: YOU ARE GOING TO SEE KEVIN O'CONNELL TRY TO MIX THINGS UP. ANYTHING HE CAN DO TO GET THE DEFENSIVE LINE ON THEIR HEELS AND CREATE TEMPO. AL: MATTISON, NOTHING. THAT IS JALEN CARTER, THEIR NUMBER 1 PICK OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA, WHO MADE HIS PRESENCE FELT LAST WEEK AND AGAIN TONIGHT. KIRK: THE BACKUP CENTER IN FOR BRADBERRY SAYING, FIRST IT WAS JORDAN DAVIS OUT OF GEORGIA AND NOW I GET THE ROOKIE, JALEN CARTER? EVERYONE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT JALEN CARTER SINCE HE WAS SIGNED, INCREDIBLE CAMP, VERY HUMBLE ATTITUDE. FIT IN PERFECT IN THE DEFENSIVE LINE ROOM. AL: ROTATING HIM IN AND OUT. THE PASS CAUGHT FOR A SHORT GAIN. THAT IS T.J. HOCKENSON, CAME OVER FROM A TRADE WITH DETROIT KIRK: YOUR ONLY CHANCE IS YOU HAVE TO MOVE THE POCKET AND YOU HAVE TO GET THE BALL OUT FAST. KIRK COUSINS IS AS GOOD AS ANYONE BECAUSE OF HIS EXPERIENCE AND INCREDIBLE PREP TO BE ABLE TO DECIPHER DEFENSES AND MAKE QUICK DECISIONS. PHILLY'S ANSWER WILL BE TO TIGHTEN COVERAGES AND NOT GIVE AWAY EASY THROWS. AL: THIRD AND 9. C.J. HAM COMES INTO THE PASS OVER THE MIDDLE, CAUGHT, HOCKENSON, ON THE RUN. FIGHTS HIS WAY TO THE 17 YARD LINE, WHERE EVANS MAKES THE TACKLE. KIRK: GOOD JOB STACKING HIM. IT GAVE HIM SOME SPACE AND HE CAN WIN AGAINST A SAFETY. EVANS HAS TO PLAYOFF. TIGHT COVERAGE ON THE RECEIVER, OSBORNE. HE IS STACKED BEHIND HER RECEIVER. YOU CAN SEE KIRK COUSINS WITH THE ENTIRE OFF-SEASON TO WORK WITH HOCKENSON, A NICE THROW ON THIRD DOWN. AL: 24 YARD GAIN. MATTISON, HE HAS BACKED UP DELVING COOK. HE IS WITH THE JETS RIGHT NOW. MATTISON HAS BEEN THE BACKUP. HE WILL NOT BE DELVING COOK BUT HOW GOOD CAN HE BE? KIRK: HE IS A PHYSICAL BACK. I THINK HE RUNS TOUGH, HE RUNS PHYSICAL. TY CHANDLER IS BACKING HIM UP. IN THIS ERA OF NFL RUNNING BACKS TALKING ABOUT, WHY ARE WE NOT GETTING PAID. MINNESOTA IS AN EXAMPLE OF RELYING ON THE PASS GAME. AL: AVONTE MADDOX WAS COMING OUT AND HOLDING HIS SHOULDER. FIRST DOWN AND GOAL. KIRK: YOU MOVE HIM AROUND, A LOT OF TIMES HE IS OUT WIDE. A GOOD JOB ON FIRST AND 10. USING HIM TO WORK ACROSS. GOOD ACTION. RAN THE FOOTBALL, COME RIGHT GOOD JOB BY COUSINS SELLING IT. AND THEN YOU SLIDE HIM OUT TO THE RIGHT. IT IS TOUGH FOR THE DEFENSE TO COME ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE FIELD AND MAKE THAT PLAY. THIS TIME, ONE OF THE MORE ELECTRIFYING RECEIVERS OUT IN SPACE. AL: THREE CATCHES FOR JJ, 23 YARDS. THE FAKE TO MATTISON, THE PASS IS CAUGHT AND HOCKENSON BANGS HIS WAY INTO THE END ZONE ZONE FOR A TOUCHDOWN! THE VIKINGS, WHO HAD DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING UNTIL THAT DRIVE, HAVE THE BALL FOR FIVE MINUTES AND GO FROM THEIR OWN 45 AND IN. KIRK: WATCH THE DEFENSE OF AND, DEREK BARNETT, WATCH THE BACKERS REACT. AS KEVIN O'CONNELL SAID, JUST BE EFFICIENT. WHEN YOU ARE EFFICIENT RUNNING THE FOOTBALL, YOU GET PLAYERS OUT OF POSITION ON FIRST AND 10. ANTICIPATING RUN, EASY FOR HIM TO GET THE BALL TO THE OUTSIDE AND TO HOCKENSON FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. AL: GREG, JUST BARELY BOOTS THAT ONE THROUGH. WITH 10:39 NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK TONIGHT'S FAST START, POWERED BY FAST TWITCH ENERGY DRINK. KIRK: THIS MINNESOTA DEFENSE IS SETTING THE EDGES, NOT GIVING UP THE BIG PLAY TO JALEN HURTS. THE DIFFERENT LOOKS BRIAN HURTS IS COMING UP WITH. THIS IS A MISS READ BY JALEN HURTS AND MINNESOTA ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT. AL:O'CONNELL, TEMPO, DIFFERENT PERSONNEL GROUPINGS, BOOTLEGS, DOING THEIR BEST TO SLOW DOWN THE PHILADELPHIA DEFENSE. AL: FROM THE 25 YARD LINE. BIG HOLE THROUGH THE MIDDLE, GAIN OF 8. D'ANDRE SWIFT SETS UP A SECOND AND 2. KAYLEE: I AM WATCHING QUEZ WATKINS BEHIND THE EAGLES BENCH. HE HAS BEEN WORKING OUT HIS RIGHT HAMSTRING. OTHERWISE, HE HAS BEEN STRETCHING AND HE DOES NOT LOOK LIKE HE WILL BE BACK IN THIS GAME ANYTIME SOON. WE JUST SAW CORNERBACK AVONTE MADDOX, THEY WERE LOOKING AT HIS LEFT SHOULDER. AL: SWIFT PICKS UP THE FIRST KIRK: GOOD TO SEE SWIFT GET HIS HANDS ON THE FOOTBALL. HE IS A BACK THAT HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL IN HIS FOURTH YEAR, COMING OVER FROM DETROIT. REALLY KNOWN EARLY IN HIS CAREER THAT CAN BE A CHANGE OF PACE BACK, CATCH THE BALL OUT OF THE WATCHING HIM OUT OF GEORGIA, YOU KNEW HE HAD PLENTY OF ABILITY TO RUN THE FOOTBALL. AL: FROM THE 35. HURTS, CHECKS IT DOWN. CATCH MADE BY SWIFT. KIRK: I THINK IT IS WORTH TALKING RIGHT NOW ABOUT JALEN HURTS. HE TOLD US YESTERDAY IN OUR PRODUCTION MEETING, LAST YEAR IS OVER. WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A NEW IDENTITY. WE HAVE A NEW OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, A LOT OF THE SAME BODIERS THAT WERE HERE LAST YEAR -- BODIES THAT WERE HERE LAST DOES NT FEEL A LITTLE BIT HESITANT? HE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE PLAYING IN THAT COMFORTABLE, CONFIDENT WAY HE WAS A YEAR AGO. AL: MEANWHILE, THE EAGLES GAINED 54 YARDS ON THAT LONG PASS TO DEVONTA SMITH. ON THE NEXT 22 PLAYS -- THE OTHER 22 PLAYS -- THEY GAIN A TOTAL OF 54 YARDS. KIRK: WOW. AL: THIRD AND 3. SWIFT PICKS UP THE FIRST. KIRK: IT FEELS LIKE THEY ARE GOING BACK TO THE RUNNING GAME RIGHT NOW. WHEN THEY GET SWIFT GOING -- THERE IS SOME GOOD PUSH HERE. THEY ARE TRYING TO GET BEHIND THE BIG FELLAS. NICE JOB BY LANDON DICKERSON OPENING THAT UP. AN EASY FIRST DOWN. THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT BRIAN FLORES IS THROWING AT THEM. THEY HAVE TO TAKE SOME SHOTS AND CREATE SOME ONE-ON-ONE CHANCES. YOU HAVE THE RECEIVERS TO GO AL: AGAIN, THEY CALLED HIS NUMBER. REMEMBER, SANDERS, THEY LET HIM GO TO CAROLINA. GAINWELL, THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE THE NUMBER 1 BACK, HE STARTED LAST WEEK BUT HAS A RIB INJURY. THEY BRING IN SWIFT, BRING IN RESHOT PENNY, WHO LOOK GOOD SO MANY TIMES BUT COULD NOT STAY HEALTHY. KIRK: AND THEY HAVE BOSTON SCOTT. IT IS A REVOLVING DOOR. AL: SECOND AND 7. THIS TIME THEY GIVE IT TO SCOTT. SCOTT PICKED UP A FIRST DOWN. BOSTON SCOTT, HE HAS BEEN WITH THE TEAM FOR FIVE YEARS. PRACTICE SQUAD IN 2018. 5' 5'6", 203. KIRK: AL, I THINK YOU WOULD AGREE IN THIS FIRST HALF, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET CUTE, WE WILL GET BEHIND THE OFFENSIVE LINE AND CONTROL THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND ROTATE OUR BACKS. AL: DO IT AGAIN. SCOTT, PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN. KIRK: THAT IS ONE WAY TO COMBAT A TEAM THAT IS THROWING A LOT OF GIMMICKS AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT LOOKS. YOU SIMPLIFY THINGS UP FRONT, GET AHAT ON AHAT AND GET A NICE PUSH. THIS IS A VETERAN OFFENSIVE CAM JURGENS IS IN. THE ONLY CHANGE THEY HAD AT RIGHT GUARD. OTHER THAN THAT, GREAT A DRIVE LIKE THIS CAN OPEN UP YOUR WHOLE OFFENSE. AL: GOOD NEWS FOR THE VIKINGS, JOSH METELLUS IS BACK IN THE GAME. HURTS WILL TAKE IT HIMSELF, TURNS THE CORNER AND PICKS UP 8 BEFORE HE SCRAMBLES OUT OF BOUNDS. THEY HAVE ALREADY RUN THE BALL 17 TIMES IN THE HALF. KIRK: WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THEM KEEPING THE EDGE. THIS TIME, THE CORNER, MURPHY, INSTEAD OF JUMPING INSIDE, HE TRIES TO USE HIS SPEED AGAINST GOEDERT. HE HAS TO GET TO THE SIDELINE, RACE JALEN HURTS TO THE BOUNDARY AND CANNOT LET HIM GET AROUND THE CORNER OR HE WILL PICK UP BIG YARDS. AL: SECOND AND A COUPLE. AGAIN, WHY NOT? BOSTON SCOTT. THAT IS SEVEN RUNS IN A ROW, 18 IN THE HALF. KIRK: NICE JOB BY THE VETERAN JASON KELSEY. THEY BROUGHT A BLITZ FROM IVAN PACE. ONE BEARCAT TO ANOTHER, HE HANDLES THAT. NICE JOB OPENING UP THE RIGHT SIDE. SEVEN STRAIGHT RUNS. AL: YEAH. 10 PLAYS ON THIS DRIVE, NINE RUNS, ONE PASS. SWIFT BACK IN THERE. MOVING AROUND ON DEFENSE. HURTS, OFF HIS BACK FOOT, THROWS IT AROUND, INTENDED FOR A.J. BROWN. SECOND DOWN AND 10. KIRK: BRIAN HURTS TELLING US WHEN JALEN HURTS CHECKS, WE WILL CHECK. THAT TIME, THAT WAS A WIN FOR FLORES AND THE VIKINGS. NICE ADJUSTMENT. NOTHING HURTS COULD DO AFTER THAT CHECK. AL: PRESSURE THIS TIME. WIDE OPEN, A.J. BROWN. AND A FIRST DOWN TO THE 17 YARD TACKLE BY CAMRYN BYNUM. KIRK: MINNESOTA BRINGS PRESSURE BUT THEN THEY SINK. THEY DO NOT WANT TO GET ANYTHING UP OVER THE TOP FOR A TOUCHDOWN SO THEY ARE WILLING TO GIVE UP ROUTES UNDERNEATH. THE PROBLEM IS WHO YOU ARE ALLOWING TO CATCH THE BALL. A.J. BROWN KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH THE BALL IN HIS HANDS. THEY DROP IN COVERAGE. JALEN HURTS SAID JUST WANT TO GET THE BALL IN THE HANDS OF MY ATHLETES AND MAKE THEM HAVE TO TACKLE GUYS IN SPACE. AL: FROM THE 17 YARD LINE. YOU TALK ABOUT A.J. BROWN, YOU GO TO AN EAGLES PRACTICE, WHICH WE WERE AT YESTERDAY, HE DOES NOT HAVE A UNIFORM, YOU THINK THIS GUY IS AN EDGE RUSHER. WOW. YOU SEE HIM NEXT TO DEVONTA SMITH, HE IS THE OTHER EXTREME. AL: 6'1", 226 AND BROAD. TO THE OUTSIDE. A FIRST AND GOAL FOR D'ANDRE JORDAN HICKS MAKES THE TACKLE. 14 PLAYS ON THE DRIVE, 11 RUNS. KIRK: GREAT JOB HERE, AGAIN, IT IS THE VISION. THIS PLAY IS DESIGNED TO GO INSIDE. HE BOUNCES IT BACK OUTSIDE FOR THAT IS 11 CARRIES FOR 59 YARDS. QUITE A HOMECOMING SO FAR FOR D'ANDRE SWIFT. AL: SWIFT. CLOSE. STOPPED AT THE 1. YOU KNOW WHO IS LOVING THIS IF HE IS LOOKING DOWN FROM ABOVE? WOODY HAYES. KIRK: OLD SCHOOL. AL: THEY GO NO-HUDDLE. KIRK: HERE THEY GO WITH THE SNEAK. AL: ARE THEY GOING TO PUSH HIM IN? THEY DO THAT ALL THE TIME. THIS TIME A WHISTLE SOUNDS, NO CLAY MARTIN CHECKING. THEY CALLED A TIMEOUT. REFEREE: PRIOR TO THE BALL BEING SNAPPED, TIMEOUT, MINNESOTA. THEIR FIRST. 30-SECOND TIMEOUT. DOMINATE THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND THEY ARE ABOUT TO PUNCH IT IN. AL: YOU HAVE TAKEN ALMOST EIGHT MINUTES OFF THE CLOCK. SECOND AND GOAL. ARE THEY GOING TO PUSH HIM IN? THEY ARE LINED UP TO DO THAT. YEP. IN THERE, TOUCHDOWN. [LAUGHTER] THEY HAVE RUN THAT PLAY A FEW TIMES, HAVEN'T THEY? KIRK: YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO YOUR EARLIER DAYS ON MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL THE LAST TIME YOU SAW A DRIVE LIKE THAT. AL: FOR SURE. KIRK: LIKE YOU SAID, THAT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU SAY IN TODAY'S AT ALL ONCE THEY GET TO SHORT YARDAGE, SO OFTEN THEY GO TO THE SNEAK WITH THE PUSH FROM BEHIND. AL: THE COMPETITION COMMITTEE LOOKED AT THAT, IT IS AN UGLY PLAY, THEY THOUGHT ABOUT TAKING IT OUT. THEY WILL LOOK AT IT AGAIN NEXT IT IS UGLY -- UNLESS YOU ARE AN EAGLES FAN, THEN IT IS BEAUTIFUL. PHILADELPHIATHIS IS A GREAT NIGH FOOTBALL. KIRK: 67 DEGREES AND WE SAW A DRIVE WERE ALL THEY DID WAS RUN THE BALL DOWN THE FIELD. AL: 10-7, IN FAVOR OF THE HOME CLUB. KAYLEE: JALEN CARTER ENTERED THIS YEAR' THIS YEAR'S NFL COMBINE AS THE PROJECTED NUMBER 1 OVERALL PICK IN THE NEWS BROKE A MORANT WAS OUT FOR HIS ARREST. IN JANUARY, CARTER ALLEGEDLY DROVE IN A STREET RACE THAT LED TO ANOTHER CAR CRASHING THAT KILLED HIS TEAMMATE AND A GEORGIA STAFF MEMBER. CARTER PLEADED NO CONTEST TO STREET RACING AND RECKLESS DRIVING. HE RECEIVED 12 MONTHS PROBATION AND STILL HAS TWO PENDING LAWSUITS AND THAT HELP EXPLAIN WHY HE DROPPED TO THE NUMBER 9 PICK AND ENDED UP HERE IN PHILLY. AL: THE CATCH IS MADE AND A 14 YARD GAIN FOR JOSH OLIVER. HE CAME OVER FROM THE RAVENS AS A FREE AGENT. KIRK: WE CONTINUE TO SEE DIFFERENT FORMATIONS, BOOTLEGS, THE BALL OUT QUICKLY. REALLY NICE JOB BY KEVIN O'CONNELL, GETTING AWAY FROM THE DEFENSIVE LINE. WE JUST SAW JALEN CARTER. SO MANY TALENTED PLAYERS UPFRONT. AL: A HANDOFF HERE. MATTISON WILL FIGHT HIS WAY TO THE 42 YARD LINE. CLOCK TICKING DOWN TO THE 2- MINUTE WARNING. THE CLOCK WILL REACH THELIKE CAR THERE SHE IS, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. KIRK: WHERE WOULD THEY BE WITHOUT HER? AL: SECOND DOWN AND 6 AT THE 2-MINUTE WARNING. COUSINS THROWS AND IT IS CAUGHT A LITTLE SHORT OF A FIRST DOWN BY HOCKENSON. KIRK: HOCKENSON HAVING A NICE NIGHT TONIGHT. YOU HAVE SOME BACKUPS IN AT SAFETY AND LINEBACKER WITH THIS PHILADELPHIA DEFENSE. AL: THIRD AND 1. COUSINS, 10-12 FOR 88 YARDS. MOST EVERYTHING HAS BEEN PRETTY SHORT EXCEPT THAT 124-YARDER -- EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE 24-YARDER TO HOCKENSON. THE PASTOR THE OUTSIDE IS CAUGHT. THAT IS JEFFERSON TO THE 50-YARD CLOCK TICKING DOWN TO ONE MINUTE. KIRK: IT IS FUN TO WATCH KIRK COUSINS, A VETERAN, ON BIG CALLS. YOU CAN SEE HIM MOVE JUSTIN JEFFERSON OUT BECAUSE OF THE SOFT COVERAGE. EASY THROW. AL: VIKINGS HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS. SLIDING TO HIS LEFT, THE PASS IS MATTISON COMING OUT OF THE COVERED BY BRANDON GRAHAM, IN HIS 14TH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE. KIRK: YOU HAVE BRANDON GRAHAM, FLETCHER COX AND A LOT OF YOUNG PLAYERS. NAKOBE DEAN WAS EXPECTED TO STEP IN, HE IS OUT WITH A FOOT INJURY SO NICHOLAS MORROW IS IN. A LOT OF INJURIES IN THE BACK END. MARIO GOODRICH IS IN FOR AVONTE MADDOX. THIS IS NOT THE SAME TEAM THAT PLAYED THE CHIEFS IN THE SUPER BOWL. AL: REED BLANKENSHIP IS IN. MEANWHILE, A TIMEOUT IS TAKEN WITH 52 SECONDS. RATE, MEANING THEY WERE ABLE TO STAY ON SCHEDULE AND KEEP THE OFFENSE GOING. AL: SO MINNESOTA DOWN TO ITS FINAL TIMEOUT. 52 SECONDS. WIDE, WIDE OPEN AND TURNING IT INTO A NICE GAME IS K.J. OSBORN. SOME ATTENTION BEING PAID TO JEFFERSON AND MATTISON, THEY FORGET ABOUT THIS GUY. KIRK: GOODRICH IS IN FOR AVONTE MADDOX AND HE IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL PASS TO THE THE REST OF THE EAGLES DEFENSE IS PLAYING MAN. OSBORN GOES TO THE OUTSIDE AND THAT IS A GREAT READ BY COUSINS. EASY READ, THROW INTO THE FLAT AND GET INTO FIELD GOAL RANGE. AL: JEFFERSON, TOP OF THE SCREEN. SLAY ON HIM. COUSINS GOING DEEP, LEFT SIDE AND THAT IS INCOMPLETE, INTENDED FOR JORDAN ADDISON, THEIR NUMBER 1 DRAFT PICK. HE STARTED HIS CAREER AT PITT AND ENDED UP AT USC. KIRK: SEAN DESAI TELLING US MY TWO ALPHA LEADERS ARE REED BLANKENSHIP AND NAKOBE DEAN. NEITHER ONE OF THEM ARE OUT HERE. I CAN RELY ON AVONTE MADDOX BUT NOW HE IS DONE. THOSE ARE ALL STARTERS. YOU ARE GOING UP AGAINST AN OFFENSE THAT CAN BE COMPLEX WITH DIFFERENT LOOKS AND IT AFFECTS AL: COUSINS, DEEP AND IT IS HAULED IN AND THE BALL COMES OUT. HE IS OUT OF BOUNDS -- THEY DROP IT, THE BEANBAG, AT THE HALF-YARD LINE. TWO OFFICIALS CONFERRING ONE MORE TIME. KIRK: I WONDER IF THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE A TOUCHBACK. REACHING FOR THE PYLON, THAT BALL CAME OUT. DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY DETERMINE THE BALL IS. THAT COULD EASILY BE A TOUCHBACK. REFEREE: THE RULING IS IT WAS A CATCH FOLLOWED BY A FUMBLE OUTSIDE OF THE GOAL LINE. THE BALL WILL BE PLACED IN THAT SPOT. AL: WHAT ARE YOU SEEING HERE? TERRY: IT APPEARS TO ME THE BALL GOES OVER THE PYLON, WHICH WOULD PUT IT OUT OF BOUNDS IN THE END IT MIGHT NOT BE DEFINITIVE. WE WILL GET SOME MORE LOOKS. THEY SAY IT WENT OUTSIDE THE PYLON, I DO NOT SEE THAT. I THINK IT IS OVER THE PYLON WHICH SHOULD MAKE THIS A REFEREE: THE PREVIOUS PLAY IS UNDER FURTHER REVIEW. AL: I THINK THIS MIGHT COME BACK BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU SAID. YOU CAN SEE PRETTY CLEARLY THAT THE BALL IS OVER THE GOAL LINE. IT JUST HAS TO GET TO THE GOAL >> AFTER REVIEW, THE FUMBLE WENT OVER THE PYLON. AL: INTERESTING POINT HERE. YOU HAVE TO HAVE POSSESSION OF THE BALL AS IT CROSSES OVER THE GOAL LINE. KIRK: FOR IT TO BE A TOUCHDOWN, CERTAINLY, BUT HE CLEARLY LOSES CONTROL BEFORE THE GOAL LINE. IT DOES INDEED GO OVER THE PYLON AS WE HEARD THE REFEREE ANNOUNCED. FOR A TOUCHDOWN. AL: WHETHER HE HAS IT IN THE GRASS OR NOT, DOESN'T MATTER. KIRK: YES. IF HE' IF HE'S LOST CONTROL, IT'S A TOUCHDOWN -- AL: SO IT' AL: SO IT'S -- PLAY CLOCK AT 25 AND GAME CLOCK AT 34. THE EAGLES TAKE OVER AT THEIR OWN 20 YARD LINE. KIRK: THINK ABOUT THE TURNOVERS IN THE FIRST HALF. THIRD ONE NOW. TWO OF THEM DEEP IN PHILADELPHIA TERRITORY. AL: THE EAGLES LOOK CONTENT TO GO IN THE LOCKER ROOM. UP 10-7. KIRK: THEY JUST TOOK A TIMEOUT. SECOND DOWN AND 3. WE WILL SEE. JUST KILLING THEM ON THE GROUND. SO I GAME OF -- GAIN OF 18 21 SECONDS TRYING TO GET INTO FIELD GOAL RANGE. WITH 21 SECOND KIRK: I'M WITH YOU. I THINK THEY WERE CONTENT TO KILL THE CLOCK AND POP OFF BIG RUNS AND NOW THEY ARE THINKING FIELD GOAL. AL: RIGHT. THE 20, 25 YARD GAIN. AND YOU ARE IN BUSINESS ESPECIALLY WITH ELLIOTT. HE' HE'S OUT OF BOUNDS WITH 12 SECONDS. THAT'S 125 GROUND YARDS FOR PHILADELPHIA IN THE FIRST HALF. KIRK: AVERAGING FIVE YARDS A CARRY. THEY CAN'T GET THE PASSING GAME GOING. CAN' CAN'T GET THE RHYTHM DESPITE HAVING JALEN HURTS AND THESE RECEIVERS. DEFINITELY CONTROLLING THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE THE LAST TWO SERIES. THAT PLAY TOOK A LOT OF TIME OFF THE CLOCK. AL: SECOND AND SIX. RUSHED THREE, DROPPED EIGHT. OUT OF BOUNDS, SEVEN SECONDS. KIRK: JUST NOTHING DOWNFIELD, ESPECIALLY ON THE EDGES. BRIAN FLOREZ DROPPING, WILLING TO CONCEDE ON THE SHORT, UNDERNEATH THROWS. KEEPING THE EYES ON THE THREAT, THE QUARTERBACK TAKING OFF AND RUNNING. AL: CAN YOU RUN A 12 OR 13 YARD OUT IN SEVEN SECONDS AND SET UP A 60 YARD FIELD GOAL? HE GOES EMPTY -- FORGET ABOUT IT. JUST GOING TO PAD THE STATS FOR THE FIRST HALF. THEY WIND UP WITH 133 RUSHING AND THEY TAKE ANOTHER TIMEOUT. NOW THEY BRING ELLIOTT IN FOR A LONG FIELD GOAL. YOU ARE LOOKING AT 61 YARDS. THEY WILL MARK IT AT HIS OWN 41 YARD LINE. HE CAN DO IT. KIRK: WATCHING HIM IN PREGAME, HE DEFINITELY HAS THE LEG. AL: CAREER LONG 61 YARDER AGAINST THE GIANTS, WHEN HE WAS A ROOKIE IN 2017. THE NEXGEN STATS TELL US HE'S GOT ABOUT A ONE IN SEVEN CHANCE OF MAKING THIS AT 16%. THAT' THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE NEXGEN STATS POWERED BY AWS. KIRK: DID YOU SEE WHAT JEFFERSON DID, THE FIRST THING HE DID, PAT HIMSELF ON THE CHEST AND SAY THAT'S ON ME? IT TELLS YOU A LOT ABOUT THE MATURITY. INSTEAD OF ARGUING OR DEBATING THINGS, HE JUST SAID, I WILL OWN THAT ONE. FRUSTRATED WITH HIMSELF. AL: YOU CAN HAVE THE PRESENCE OF MIND, BUT ON A PLAY LIKE THAT, HOW CAN YOU BLAME HIM? 61 YARDER ON ITS WAY, AND IT IS GOOD! HE DID IT. ELLIOTT, A COUPLE OF FIELD GOALS. THEY RUN, RUN, RUN, SET UP THE 61 YARDER AND SET UP A SIX POINT LEAD. KIRK: THAT IS YOUR DRIVER RIGHT LOW M INTO THE WIND. THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO RELY ON OLD RELIABLE, JASON KELCE AND THE ROTATION OF BACKS TO BE PHYSICAL AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. THAT'S BEEN THE ADJUSTMENT AS WELL. AL: ELLIOTT TO KICK OFF. THE 61 YARDER AT THE END OF THE THIS DRIVE WILL START AT 25. KAYLEE: BOTH COACHES ACKNOWLEDGE THEY TRADED ADJUSTMENTS IN THE FIRST HALF. FIRST IT WAS THE VIKINGS DEFENSE AND IN THE END, THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES OFFENSE FIGURED OUT HOW TO RUN THE BALL DOWN THE FIELD. NICK SIRIANNI SAID OUR GUYS WORK THEIR BUTTS OFF, BUT DID ACKNOWLEDGE THE VIKINGS GET THEMSELVES IN DIFFICULT SITUATIONS. HE SAID MINNESOTA CONTROLLED ALL OF THOSE MOMENTS, THE SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS. HE SAID, WE'VE GOT TO CLEAN IT UP. NOW HE WANTS HIS DEFENSE TO CREATE AND GET THE BALL THEMSELVES. AL: REPLAY OF THE FIRST HALF LAST WEEK THAT BEGAN ON THE GROUND. NOTHING DOING HERE FOR ALEXANDER MATTISON AFTER A GAIN OF A YARD. KIRK: SOMETIMES, IT'S THE OVER LOOKED AT ASPECT OF THE GAME. IF YOU ARE AN EAGLES FAN THE FIRST COUPLE WEEKS, YOU HAVE TO BE PRETTY HAPPY. GREAT PUNTING. WEEK TWO, WE'VE SEEN THE FUMBLE ON THE PUNT. AL: COUSINS LOSES THE BALL! IT IS PICKED UP. AND DOWN TO THE 7-YARD LINE GO THE EAGLES. KIRK: CHRISTIAN DARRISAW TRYING HIS BEST TO FIGHT THROUGH THE ENTRY ON THE LEFT SIDE, GOING AGAINST JOSH SWEAT WHO HAS A LOT OF SPEED OFF THE EDGE. NOT ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE GOOD HANDS. CLOSED FAST WITH THE CLUB OVER THE SHOULDER TO KNOCK THE BALL LOOSE. AL: IT WAS JOSH SWEAT. THEY ARE SO DEEP AND SO GOOD ALONG THE DEFENSIVE FRONT. FOUR TURNOVERS. SEVEN ON THE SEASON. FIRST AND GOAL FOR PHILADELPHIA. ON THE GROUND. THAT DID NOT TAKE LONG. ONLY TO THE HALF YARD LINE. KIRK: DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE TITANS. THAT WAS CLOSE. AL: HERE WE GO, THE PUSH, THE JALEN HURTS TAKES IT IN. THAT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP. KIRK: YOU KNOW IT'S COMING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS SQUATTING THESE DAYS, BUT HE HAS AS STRONG A LEGS AS ANYONE. IT'S NOT LIKE THEY NEED SWIFT TO PUSH JALEN HURTS FROM BEHIND. THAT OFFENSIVE LINE IS HAVING A NIGHT. AL: THE TURNOVER, COSTLY. ELLIOTT FOR THE EXTRA POINT. AND EAGLES GO ON TOP BY A SCORE OF 20-7. 1:07 INTO THE SECOND HALF. THE VIKINGS HAVE THE CHARGERS AT HOME NEXT WEEK. PHILADELPHIA GOES DOWN TO TAMPA BAY. THAT SCOOTS THROUGH THE END KIRK: WE WERE HOPING TO SEE JUSTIN JEFFERSON AGAINST DARIUS SLAY. ABLE TO GET GREAT SEPARATION. A CHANCE TO PICK UP THE FIR WE SEE THE ADJUSTMENT HERE. SLEIGH SO LOCKED IN. DOES A GREAT JOB OF PREPPING AND SUCH A SMART GAME. I HAVE A FEELING NOW THAT MINNESOTA IS DOWN 13, YOU WILL SEE MORE OF THE MATTER THAN WE'VE SEEN UP TO THIS POINT. AL: YOU CAN ONLY HOPE. TOP OF THE SCREEN, PLAY ACTION, PRESSURE ON. READ PERFECTLY. ZACH CUNNINGHAM, SIGNED AS A FREE AGENT LAST YEAR IN TENNESSEE AND BEFORE THAT WITH HOUSTON. KIRK: WATCH THE OFFENSIVE LINE IN THE INTERIOR. I FEEL LIKE THEY GAVE THIS A WAY TO ALLOW CUNNINGHAM TO READ HE NEVER HAD A CHANCE BECAUSE READING THE GUARDS LED HIM TO ANTICIPATE THE SCREEN BEING THROWN. AL: LOSS OF FIVE. SECOND AND 15. THAT GOES NOWHERE. MADDISON BACK IN THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. LAST YEAR, THIS WAS A TEAM, MINNESOTA, 11-0 IN ONE POSITION GAMES. THIS IS CALLED REVERTING TO THE MEAN RIGHT NOW. KIRK: ABSOLUTELY. THEY ALWAYS SEEMED TO FIND A WAY, BUT THEY PLAY CLEAN FOOTBALL FOR THE MOST PART. COUSINS THREW SOME PIX, BUT TONIGHT IT'S BEEN A DISASTER WITH TURNOVERS LIKE IN WEEK ONE. AL: THIRD AND 15. COUSINS FIRES DOWN THE SIDELINE, REMEMBER, THIS IS STILL A TEAM THAT WAS DOWN 33-0 LAST YEAR SO DON'T TOUCH THAT DIAL JUST YET. KIRK: THAT PHILADELPHIA DEFENSE AFTER THE SUDDEN CHANGE, GREAT JOB. YOU THINK MINNESOTA WILL TRY TO PUT A DRIVE TOGETHER AND INSTEAD THEY GET A THREE AND OUT. AL: COUSINS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, HE HAD, WHAT, RIGHT COMEBACKS BETWEEN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND OVERTIME? AL: HE DID. HERTZ GOING TO TAKE OFF AND NOT GO VERY FAR. HE IS DOWN AFTER AGAIN OF ONE. KIRK: JUST NOTHING DOWNFIELD. BRIAN FLORES DROPPING FIVE DEFENSIVE BACKS, DETERMINED NOT TO GIVE THE BIG PLAYS UP TO DEVONTA SMITH AND A.J. BROWN. AGAIN, YOU'RE EITHER GOING TO CHECK IT DOWN OR HAVE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL AND SCRAMBLE AND CREATE FOR JALEN HURTS. AS MUCH AS THEY WANT TO TRY AND ATTACK DOWNFIELD I THINK THEY HAVE TO HIT SOME CROSSERS NOTHING RIGHT NOW VERTICALLY. HIS GOOD NIGHT CONTINUES. HE TAKES IT TO THE 37 YARD LINE. HE HAS CARRIED THE BALL 14 TIMES FOR 73 YARDS. KIRK: IF YOU ARE WATCHING HIM FOR A PHILADELPHIA FAN, DETROIT, A LOT OF TIMES HE IS CATCHING THE BALL IN THE BACKFIELD. WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS VISION AND PATIENCE. EVEN ON THAT RUN, TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE OF THIRD AND 4. INSTEAD OF PANICKING AND POWERING THROUGH, HE WAITED PATIENTLY, CUT BACK, AND FOUND SOME POSITIVE YARDS. AL: THIRD AND 4. WIDE OPEN! IT IS SMITH AGAIN, ALL THE WAY FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. JORDAN HICKS PUT THE PRESSURE ON, BUT HE GOT IT AWAY. 63 YARDS AND THE EAGLES GO UP 26-7. KIRK: GREAT JOB HERE BY JALEN HE GETS PRESSURE RIGHT HERE AND GETS INTO HIS FACE. I JUST TALKED ABOUT HOW THESE SAFETIES ARE GETTING THE. HARRISON SMITH KIND OF HOLDS HIS GROUND, OPENS UP THE BACK END, AND THERE IS THE HOME RUNCELEBRA SCORES TWO TOUCHDOWNS TONIGHT ON 63 AND 34 YARD CATCHES. THE 63 YARDER WAS THE TD. 54 ONLY TOOK HIM TJUST TALKING A HE SAID, I CAN' HE SAID, I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW HARD IT IS TO SCORE TOUCHDOWNS. IN COLLEGE IT IS PRETTY EASY. HE SAID HE AND AJAY GO BACK AND FORTH ABOUT HOW TOUGH IT IS. HE GETS TWO TONIGHT. AL: THREE ON THE SEASON. KAYLEE: A.J. HAS TWO KIDS OF HIS OWN AND HE HAS GIVEN DEVONTA SOME ADVICE, SAYING SLEEP WHEN BABY GIRL SLEEPS. HE TURNS THE LIGHTS ON IN THE EAGLES FACILITY. A.J. SAID, YEAH, WE WILL SEE IF THAT CONTINUES. AL: IT'S ABOUT AS GOOD AS IT GETS, A ONE-TWO PUNCH. FIRST DOWN, FORWARD PROGRESS TO JUSTIN JEFFERSON WHO HAULS IN HIS SIXTH CATCH OF THE NIGHT FOR 69 YARDS. KIRK: GIVING HIM SOME SOFT COVERAGE. WITH THIS LEAD HE IS COMFORTABLE IN DOING THAT. GOOD JOB BY KIRK COUSINS. LOOKED LIKE HE WAS LOOKING OUT TO C.J. HAM AND. FOUND THE MATCHUP HE WANTED. AL: PRESSURE. HENNESSEY THROWS IT AWAY. GETS IT AWAY, ANYWAY, TO JOSH OLIVER FOR NO GAIN. NICHOLAS MORROW CAME FLYING THROUGH. KIRK: GOOD WELL-TIMED THE BLITZ AND IT AFFECTS THE TIMING. MORROW IN FOR DEAN, AND HE COMES FREE. OFFENSIVE LINE TO THEIR LEFT, FR EED UP THAT RIGHT SIDE. MORROW VERY CLOSE TO GETTING TO COUSINS, AND THAT IS WHERE THAT EXPERIENCE, SMART ENOUGH TO GET THE BALL OUT OF HIS HANDS. AL: COUSINS FIRES. AND JEFFERSON CAN' AND JEFFERSON CAN'T HANDLE IT. BROKEN UP BY BIG NUMBER 2, DARIUS SLAY. KIRK: HE WAS FRUSTRATED RIGHT WHEN HE CAME UP. THIS TIME'S LEG GETS UP A LOT TIGHTER. RIGHT AT THE BREAK HE GRABBED ONTO THE JERSEY. THAT IS THE CALL I THINK HE WANTED. YOU AGREE WITH THAT? IT LOOKED LIKE A HOLE THERE. >> IT DID. SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEFENSIVE HOLDING. AL: NOTHING GOING RIGHT FOR THE MINNESOTA VIKINGS TONIGHT. DOWN BY 20. CROWD ROARING AGAIN. THIRD AND 10. PRESSURE ON COUSINS. STEPS UP, THROWS, CAUGHT! THAT'S THE RICKY ADDISON WITH A JOSH JOBE COVERING ON THE PLAY. FOR THE SECOND GAME IN A ROW, ADDISON IS IN FOR A SCORE. KIRK: THIS IS THE EXPERIENCE OF COUSINS. HE IS LOOKING LEFT THE ENTIRE WAY. WANTS TO BE ABLE TO THROW, AND THEN YOU GET A ONE-ON-ONE MATCHUP HERE. WATCH KIRK COUSINS, HIS EYES. AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT AFTER HE STEPS UP, HE MOVES HIS SAFETY THERE AND THEN SEES THE ONE-ON-ONE MATCHUP. KEVIN MANGANO SAID WE NEED TO FIND A GUY WHO CAN WIN ONE-ON-ONE AND THEY FOUND ADDISON. AL: THAT WAS TEXTBOOK. GREAT DESCRIPTION OF THAT. THE KICK IS GOOD BY JOSEPH. SO, MINNESOTA TRYING TO HANG IN JOSEPH TO KICK OFF. A 13 POINT GAME AFTER THE 62 YARD TOUCHDOWN ON A THIRD DOWN AND 10. KIRK: THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT MINNESOTA OBVIOUSLY NEEDED, WAS A BIG PLAY. YOU HAVE TO GIVE KIRK COUSINS A LOT OF CREDIT FOR NOT PANICKING, NOT LOSING HIS COOL. HE KNOWS THERE IS STILL A LONG WAY TO GO AND THEY ARE ABLE TO CLIMB BACK INTO THIS GAME. THEIR DEFENSE HAS BEEN PLAYING ONE OF THE FEW TIMES WE SAW MAN-TO-MAN COVERAGE, JALEN HURTS MADE HIM PAY FOR IT WITH THAT BIG THROW TO DEVONTA SMITH. WE WILL SEE WHAT BRIAN FLORES ADJUSTS BACK NOW TO DEFENSIVELY. AL: HURTS, 11 OF 14 FOR 147. OF COURSE THOSE TWO BOMBS TO SMITH, MOST OF IT. PASS IS CAUGHT, GAIN OF 9. KAYLEE: RIGHT TACKLE LANE JOHNSON WAS JUST DOING SOME RELEASE WORK ON HIS LEFT GROIN. HE HAD ISSUES WITH IT LAST YEAR AND MISSED TIME BECAUSE OF IT. THE EAGLES ARE WITHOUT RUNNING BACK BOSTON SCOTT. HE IS BEING EVALUATED IN CONCUSSION PROTOCOL. WATKINS THE RECEIVER IS OUT. ON DEFENSE, THE VON TO MINIX IS OUT AS WELL. AL: WE SAW PENNY ON THE KICK SWIFT BREAKS ONE AND A NICE TACKLE TO AVOID A LONGER GAME THERE BY CAMRYN BYNUM. THE FLAG IS DOWN. KIRK: LANDON DICKERSON ON A HOLD >> HOLDING, OFFENSE NUMBER 69. KIRK: ONE OF THE FEW MISTAKES WE HAVE SEEN BY THIS OFFENSIVE LEFT GUARD LOCKS UP DEAN LOWRY. ANY TIME YOU SEE A BALL BOUNCE, DEFENDER TRYING TO WORK OUT, YOU CAN SEE THEM GRAB ONTO THAT JERSEY. GOOD CALL BY THE OFFICIAL. THIS IS WHAT PHILADELPHIA DEALT WITH LAST WEEK. MAKING SOME MISTAKES, GETTING BEYOND THE STICKS. THE RUN GAME COORDINATOR, ONE OF THE TOP OFFENSIVE LINE COACHES IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. IN THE NFL. AL: SECOND DOWN AND 11, BALL AT THE 23 YARD LINE. RUSH ONLY 3. SEND IT OUT TO SWIFT, GOOD TACKLE ON THE OUTSIDE BY BYRON MURPHY. SO THIRD DOWN AND 6 COMING UP. CLOCK UNDER EIGHT MINUTES TO GO IN THE THIRD. KIRK: COUSINS SAYS JUST GET ME THE FOOTBALL BACK. WE WANT TO GET WITHIN A POSSESSION, HAVE A CHANCE AGAIN TO KEEP THAT MAGIC GOING FROM LAST YEAR, THOSE FOURTH-QUARTER COMEBACKS THAT HE HAD. ONE THING YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IS YOU DO IT THAT OFTEN, YOU DO BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN DO IT. AL: YOU ARE DOWN 33-0, YOU BELIEVE IN ANYTHING. KIRK: NO DOUBT. >> FALSE START, OFFENSE NUMBER 0. 5 YARD PENALTY. AL: SWIFT OVERANXIOUS. KIRK: TRIED TO SELL IT, ANYWAY. LOST HIS BALANCE. HE JUMPS AND THEN ASK LIKE HE MEANT TO DO IT. NO, NO, WATCH THE BLITZ. [LAUGHS] AL: VIKINGS WITHOUT A PENALTY TONIGHT. BUT FOUR TURNOVERS. THIRD AND 11. AGAIN, JUST RUSHING 3, DROPPING 8. SEEN A LOT OF ACTION TONIGHT, NEXT TO NO ACTION LAST WEEK. AND THAT WILL MAKE IT FOURTH KIRK: MINNESOTA CAPITALIZING ON A FEW MISCUES HERE BY PHILADELPHIA WITHOUT HOLDING CALL, THE FALSE START. PHILADELPHIA GOES BACKWARDS AND THE VIKINGS DO THEIR JOB. GET KIRK COUSINS THE BALL BACK, NOW DOWN 13. AL: BRANDON POWELL, FORMER RAM, SETS UP INSIDE HIS OWN 30. ARRYN SIPOSS SENDS IT HIS WAY ON AN ANGLE. LET'S IT BOUNCE, AND AN EAGLE IS THE FIRST TO TOUCH IT, SO IT WILL BE DOWN AT THAT SPOT. 6:19 REMAINING NOW IN THE THIRD BEGINNING OF WEEK TWO OF THE 2023 NFL SEASON. PHILLY UP 27-14. CLARA, THE GIANTS AND THE 49ERS ON THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL. MEANWHILE, COUSINS AND THE VIKINGS TRYING TO GET ALL THE WAY BACK IN IT, AS MEDICINE PICKS UP FOUR. KIRK: ALL THINGS CONSIDERED UPFRONT FOR MINNESOTA, THEY HAVE HAD AN UPHILL BATTLE AGAINST THIS PHILADELPHIA DEFENSIVE DOING A GOOD JOB OF TRYING TO MIX THIS PLAYCALLING UP. AL: ROLLING, HAS TIME, THROWS, CAUGHT, BUT WELL SHORT OF A FIRST DOWN. JORDAN ADDISON MAKING THE GRAB THERE, THIRD AND SHORT. KIRK: WHEN THEY HAVE GOTTEN THE EAGLES ON THEIR HEELS IT HAS BEEN A MIX OF CHANGE OF TEMPO, MOVING COUSINS AROUND, ANYTHING TO SLOW DOWN THAT FRONT. COUSINS HANGS IN THE POCKET, PASS IS INCOMPLETE, COVERAGE WAS GREAT. THAT WAS JEFFERSON OVER THE MIDDLE AND HE WAS COVERED BY THE LINEBACKER ZACH CUNNINGHAM. KIRK: AL IT, LOOKED LIKE FLESHER COX MAY HAVE GOTTEN HIS HAND ON HIS SHOULDER AS HE RELEASES THE BALL. RIGHT THERE, IT LOOKS LIKE HE GOT A GOOD PUSH ON HIM. REMEMBER, COUSINS GETS HIT MORE THAN ANYBODY. GREAT COVERAGE BY THE LINEBACKER CUNNINGHAM. IF YOU CAN GET A LINEBACKER ON JEFFERSON YOU WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT IF YOU CAN. RYAN WRIGHT. GOING TO LET IT BOUNCE, AND SO WILL THE VIKINGS. ALL THE WAY TO THE 8 YARD LINE. KIRK: DEVONTA SMITH IS THAT A -- HAS HAD A COUPLE CHANCES TO GET OUT. LOOKED LIKE HE MIGHT SCORE A ABLE TO CLIMB UP AND MAKE A GREAT PLAY. THIS IS WHERE HE GOT MAN-TO-MAN, WENT RIGHT BY EVANS. THAT IS WHERE JALEN HURTS GOT PRESSURED. THAT WAS A NICE 70 YARDER. WHEN HE GETS ONE-ON-ONE, HE IS AS GOOD AS ANYBODY AT CREATING THOSE FAVORABLE MATCHUP' THOSE FAVORABLE MATCHUP'S AND GETTING THE SEPARATION. AL: 57-YARD KICK. SPOT THE BALL AT THE 7-YARD THROUGH THE MIDDLE. WORKING HIS WAY OUT TO THE 11-YARD LINE. GAIN OF FOUR, AS THAT RUN GAME CONTINUES FOR SWIFT. 15 CARRIES, 77 YARDS. KIRK: REALLY IMPRESSIVE TO JUST WATCH HIM TONIGHT. IT'S ONE THING, WITH THE WAY GAIN WILL PLAYED LAST WEEK YOU THINK HE WILL BECOME THE GUY MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT SWIFT WOULD COME IN AND HAVE A ROLE. BUT MANY WONDERED WHAT IT WOULD BE. THEY HAVE ASKED HIM TO CARRY THE LOAD AND HE HAS HAD A HECKUVA NIGHT WITH THE OFFENSE OF LINE PAVING THE WAY. AL: BREAKS TACKLES, TO THE 20-YARD LINE HE GOES. A BLOCK BY THE LEFT TACKLE, KIRK: YOU CAN SEE IT PUTS A LOT OF PRESSURE. LOOK AT THAT HOLE. THE SAFETY IS COLLAPSING DOWN IN A HURRY, WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN DOING AGAINST HIS RUN GAME. BUT HE HAD SUCH GOOD BALANCE, PHYSICAL LOWER HALF, ABLE TO STAY OFF AND BOUNCE OFF THOSE SAFETIES. AL: FROM THE 20. HURTS, THROWS, CAUGHT. BUT AGAIN, ONLY A SHORT GAIN. THIS TIME IT IS GOTHARD AGAIN MAKING THE CATCH. HE'S COUGHT SIX TONIGHT BUT FOR ONLY 21 TOTAL YARDS. KIRK: YEAH, A QUIET NIGHT. IT HAS REALLY BEEN MORE ABOUT THIS RUNNING GAME, AND YOU CANNOT BLAME THEM. AL: I MEAN, FOR A LEAGUE WHICH IS ABOUT 60/40 PASS/RUN, PHILLY HAS RUN THE BALL 32 TIMES AND THROWN ONLY 20. SECOND ANF 5. RUN NUMBER 33. EFFECTIVE AGAIN. TACKLED UP AT THE 36 YARD LINE, THE ANDRE SWIFT. KIRK: AGAIN, YOU GO TO WHAT IS WORKING ON THAT NIGHT. SOME NIGHTS IT IS THROWING THE FOOTBALL, OTHER NIGHTS IT IS THE OFFENSIVE LINE HOLDING THINGS. THESE ARE BIG HOLES HE IS RUNNING THROUGH. YOU ARE ASKING LINEBACKERS AND THE SAFETIES TO COME DOWN AND MAKE PLAYS. THIS GUY IS 5'9", 215 POUNDS. IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY THAT HE HAS. AL: AGAIN, HE'S OVER 100. CLOSE TO A FIRST, ON HIS 18TH CARRY OF THE NIGHT. HIS LONGEST GAIN IS ONLY 12 YARDS BUT HE HAS PICKED UP 106 TOTAL YARDS. KIRK: WATCH THIS OFFENSIVE LINE. HELP OUT, GET UP TO THAT LINEBACKER. AGAIN, THAT'S TWO UC BEARCATS GOING HEAD TO HEAD. THE HOLES ARE CONTINUING TO OPEN AS YOU WEAR DOWN THE DEFENSE INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER, THE HOLES CONTINUE TO GET BIGGER AND BIGGER. DEFENSE -- AL: SOONER OR LATER YOU KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO SEE RASHAD PENNY, AND IT'S SOONER, THERE HE IS. FIRST CARRY IS AN EAGLE. TAKES IT ACROSS THE 50 FOR A UNDER TWO MINUTES TO GO NOW INTO THIRD. KIRK: THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS WITH THIS LEAD, THEY ARE UP 13. BUT IF YOU ARE A SAFETY IN THESE HOLES ARE OPENING UP, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU ARE GETTING DOWNHILL IN A IF THIS GAME WERE CLOSER, IT WOULD BE A PERFECT TIME FOR BRIAN JOHNSON TO PUT THE BALL INTO THE BELLY OF THE BACK, HOLE IT OUT, AND CREATE A ONE-ON-ONE MATCHUP ON THE OUTSIDE WERE YOU COULD HIT A HOMERUN. BECAUSE THOSE SAFETIES RIGHT NOW ARE SENSING THEY HAVE TO GET DOWNHILL. AL: CAUGHT ON THE OUTSIDE IS PEN NY. PENY CAN STAY HEALTHY. WE HAVE SEEN HIM HAVE SOME BIG GAMES WITH THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS. BUT THE PROBLEM IS HE IS OFTEN INJURED. KIRK: YOU GO BACK TO 2021, JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO, HE LED THE ENTIRE NFL IN YARDS PER CARRY. YOU ARE RIGHT, IT HAS BEEN MORE ABOUT JUST TRYING TO STAY HEALTHY AND BE THAT BACK WE ALL KNOW HE CAN BE. IN HIS 6TH YOU NOW OUT OF SAN DIEGO STATE. AL: SECOND AND 5. PENNY AGAIN. HALF A MINUTE TO GO. GOING TO LET THE CLOCK RUN DOWN ALL THE WAY TO THE FOURTH. GOING TO BE THIRD DOWN AND 3 AT THE RESUMPTION OF PLAY. IN THE MEANTIME, THE EAGLES AT LEAST KNOWING THE LINEUP, MAYBE TO TRY AND DRAW THEM OFFSIDE, MAYBE RUN A PLAY. AND THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THAT. IT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY PULLED OFF. HARRISON PHILLIPS CAME ACROSS THE LINE. YEAH, THEY WERE READY TO LET THE CLOCK RUN DOWN. KIRK: YOU CALLED IT, TRYING TO DRAW THEM OFF, AND IT WORKED. >> DEFENSE, FIVE YARD PENALTY, RESULTS IN A FIRST DOWN. AL: WHEN YOU OVER DRAMATIZE COMING UP TO THE LINE IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT AND EVERYBODY IS MOVING AROUND A LITTLE BIT, SOMETHING IS COMING. THAT IS THE FIRST VIKINGS PENALTY OF THE NIGHT. AND YOU CAN WIND THE CLOCK, AND IT WILL TAKE US TO THE FOURTH. WE HAVE PLAYED THREE. INLOST THE GAME. HE SAID HE WILL CONVEY THAT TO HIS TEAMMATES. AL: FIRST AND 10. AS PER HERTZ THROWS TO THE F ANYONE CAN WALK HIM BACK -- WE ARE POUNDING THE BALL, IT IS WHAT IT IS. AL: YOU WILL HAVE YOUR NIGHTS. WHO'SE OX IS GETTING GORED? KIRK: IF ANYONE WANTS TO PAT ME ON THE BACK FOR THE SUPER BOWL, IF WE HAD WON I WOULD BE HAPPY. I THOUGHT IT WAS NEAT THAT HE WOULD TELL THAT TO HIS TEAM. JUST FOR NIGHT AL: SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO BE THE BABYSITTER FOR YOUR RECEIVERS. KIRK: IT IS THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT AND FIRE THAT MAKES THEM SO GOOD. AL: THIRD AND NINE. RUSHING MOST OF THE NIGHT. THIS PASS IS CAUGHT BUT A LITTLE SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN. SMITH TACKLED BY JACKSON. THEY WILL MARK IT AT THE 27 AND MAKE IT FORTH AND ONE. KIRK: HE HAS A COUPLE TOUCHDOWN PASSES BUT THIS IS A GREAT JOB. THE TIMING, RHYTHMIC, THROW. AL: PUSHING. FIRST DOWN! AND YOU RUN THAT PUSH PLAY AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AND JALEN HURTS HAS BEEN FANTASTIC. KIRK: I SAW A GRAPHIC THIS MORNING AND I THINK HE MISSED IT ONE TIME. ON THE ONE TIME HE DID NOT MAKE IT ON FOR THAN ONE. I THINK BACK TO LAST YEAR, LOOK AT POOR HARRISON SMITH JUMPING ON TOP OF THE PILE AND GOING FOR A RIDE. AL: FOURTH AND ONE. LAST YEAR, 10 RUSHES AND NINE FIRST DOWNS. 1-1 TONIGHT. TWO MINUTES INTO THE FOURTH FROM THE 29 YARD LINE. NICE BLOCKING IN FRANCE. THE PASS TO BROWN FOR THE TOUCHDOWN BUT THE FLAG IS DOWN AT THE 33 YARD LINE. KIRK: THEY WILL GIVE PENNY WHO PICKED UP THE BLITZ. >> HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER 23. AL: IT COMES BACK. KIRK: THE BLITZ COMES UP THE IT MAY HAVE CAUGHT HIM BY SURPRISE. A GOOD EFFORT BY THE ROOKIE PACE JUNIOR TO GET AROUND HIM WHICH CAUSED THE HOLD AND THE PENALTY WHICH NEGATES THE TOUCHDOWN. AL: THE EGOS HAVE NOT SEEN THAT IN A WHILE. THE VIKINGS ARE RUSHING A LOT OF PASS PLAYS. KIRK: MINNESOTA DOING THE BEST JOB THEY CAN TO ROTATE BODIES. NOT A TON OF DEPTH WITH TIME OF NOT A STATISTIC YOU THINK OF IN A NFL GAME BUT TIME OF POSSESSION IS LIKE 33 MINUTES TO 13 FAVORING PHILADELPHIA. THEY ARE KEEPING THE BALL AWAY FROM KIRK COUSINS. AL: HE WAS A LITTLE SLOW IN GETTING UP. FIRST AND 20 OFF THE FATE. GOING DEEP AGAIN FOR BROWN! CANNOT MAKE THE CATCH. BROWN LOOKING FOR A FLAG, NO. HE GETS NINE. EVANS COVERING ON THE PLAY GOT HURT EARLIER. KIRK: TALKING ABOUT BROWN AND HE WALKS OVER TO THE SIDELINE WITH A LITTLE SLANT ANDIS A FRAME OR TWO EARLY BUT IN REAL-TIME THE BALL IS COMING IN AS THE CONTACT OCCURS. THEY DON' THEY DON'T CALL THAT AS PASS INTERFERENCE BECAUSE IN REAL TIME IT IS BANG BANG. KIRK: EVANS GETTING WORKED ON. AL: SECOND AND 20 FROM THE 35 JALEN HURTS WITH A TON OF TIME. SURVEYING. FLUSHED OUT. THE SECONDARY DID ITS JOB. HUNTER WHO HAD A BIG RUSH EARLY ON AND HAS BEEN QUIET SINCE THEN THOUGH THEY REALLY HAVE BEEN ONLY RUSHING THREE. KIRK: LOOK AT THE TOP OF YOUR SCREEN, FIVE DEFENDERS BACK THEY TAKE AWAY THE UNDERNEATH. EVENTUALLY A RECEIVER BUT JALEN HURTS IS RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE. IN THE PREVIOUS PLAY THEY WERE LOOKING AT, IT WAS A CLOSE CALL. A RARE MAN-TO-MAN OPPORTUNITY FOR BROWN THAT HE JUST MISSED AL: THIRD AND 23. JALEN HURTS. THERE IS A HUNTER AGAIN AND THIS TIME HE TAKES HIM DOWN BACK BY THE 50 YARD LINE. NEIL HUNTER, OUT OF -- KIRK: LAST YEAR 10.5 SACKS. EASING HIS WAY UP RESPECTFUL OF THE SPEED OF JALEN HURTS. HE DOES NOT GRAB THE FACEMASK. GOOD JOB BY COVERAGE TO FREE HIM AL: A 12 YARD SACK TAKING HIM OUT OF JAKE ELLIOTT' OUT OF JAKE ELLIOTT'S FIELD GOAL RANGE. FAIL CATCH -- FAIR CATCH MADE. 11:19 LEFT IN THE FOURTH. THE EAGLES, 2-0, LEADING THE : VIKINGS TRYING TO CLIMB INTO IT AND HANG IN. HUNTER WITH THE SACK HAS THREE IN THE GAME. AND ONE LAST WEEK. FOUR ON THE SEASON. IT IS MATTESON -- MATTISON WHO TAKES THE TOSS AFTER A GAIN OF EIGHT YARDS. KIRK: IT FEELS LIKE THE GAME IS OVER BUT THEY ARE A TOUCHDOWN AWAY FROM THIS BEING A ONE POSSESSION GAME. THERE ARE 11 MINUTES TO GO. THAT WAS A POTENTIAL KNOCKOUT PUNCH DRIVE FOR PHILADELPHIA AND THEY MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY AND GIVE THE BALL BACK TO COUSINS. AL: AND YOU HAVE JEFFERSON, AND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. SECOND AND THREE. COUSINS FIRE IS. IT IS CAUGHT AND DROPPED AT THE 40 YARD LINE. K.J. OSBORN LOOKING UPFIELD BEFORE HE BROUGHT IT IN. KIRK: JUSTIN JEFFERSON WITH A NICE SAIL ROUTE. THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD IS WIDE OPEN RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM. ONE-ON-ONE AGAINST THE SAFETY, EDMONDS. I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF HIM BUT HE LOSES HIS FOCUS. AL: THIRD AND THREE. COUSINS FLOATS IT. JEFFERSON WIGGLES HIS WAY OUT TO THE 45 YARD LINE. JOSH SWEAT CAME IN AND BURIED COUSINS AS HE THREW IT BUT A BIG MEANWHILE YOU HAVE AN INJURED VIKING, THE RIGHT TACKLE. INJURY TIMEOUT. HIS REPLACEMENT COMES IN, SIXTH COMING OVER FROM BUFFALO. MATTISON. NICE RUN. HE TAKES US TO THE 50 YARD LINE. A GAIN OF SIX. DOWN TO 10 MINUTES TO GO IN REGULATION. KIRK: WHEN THE DRIVE STARTED PHILADELPHIA'S OFFENSE MISSES AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT THIS GAME OUT OF REACH. AL: OFF THE FAKE. FIRES. CAUGHT IN TRAFFIC. JEFFERSON COVERED WELL TAKES IT DOWN TO T 28 YARD LINE FOR A VIKING FIRST DOWN. KIRK: GOOD JOB PLAY ACTION. GO BACK TO PLAY-ACTION. DECENT COVERAGE FROM SLATE. -- FROM SLAY. RIGHT CONCENTRATION FROM JUSTIN JEFFERSON. THERE HE SHOWS YOU STRONG HANDS AND CONCENTRATION. AL: EIGHT CATCHES, 115 YARDS. AT THE 28. SLIPS IT AWAY. -- FLIPS IT AWAY. JOSH SWEAT, HE FORCED A FUMBLE EARLIER. KIRK: YOU DON'T REALIZE HOW BIG SWEAT IS. 6' 6'5", 265. TRYING TO HOPE THE TREND WILL CONTINUE THIS YEAR STARTING AL: MINNESOTA, DESPITE THE WINS LAST YEAR, 13, GAVE UP MORE POINTS THAN THEY SCORED. SECOND AND 10. SLINGING IT OUT HERE. NICE MOVE ALL THE WAY TO THE 24 YARD LINE GOES TY CHANDLER, THE SECOND YEAR MAN OUT OF NORTH CAROLINA. KIRK: THINKING ABOUT FOUR DOWN AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME, DOWN 13, YOU OPEN UP THE PLAYBOOK. THEY HAVE JEFFERSON, I CAN SEND AND HOCKENSON. AL: THIRD DOWN AND SIX. JEFFERSON COMES IN MOTION. OUT OF THE SLOT ON THE LEFT COUSINS HANGS IN THERE AND THROWS. CAUGHT AT THE 10 YARD LINE. JEFFERSON, THEY CANNOT STOP HIM. MARIO GOODRICH COVERING ON THE KIRK: LATE IN ADJUSTING. THIS IS JEFFERSON. WHERE IS THE ADJUSTMENT? LINEBACKERS ARE CALLING HIM TO COME OVER THAT IS STEALING FOR KIRK COUSINS. AL: JEFFERSON IS HAPPY TO GET AWAY FROM SLAY AND TAKES IT TO THE 10 SO IT IS A FIRST AND GOAL. LOOK OUT FROM BEHIND. WIDE OPEN IS K.J. OSBORN FOR THE TOUCHDOWN! JOSH SWEAT CAME IN AND GOT THERE TOO LATE. OSBORN FOR THE SECOND TIME TONIGHT TOOK IT OUT IN OUTER KIRK: HERE IS JOSH JOBE. REMEMBER THE BACKUPS BECAUSE OF THE INJURIES. WATCH HIM ON THE CROSS OR AND THE HESITATION. AND THAT IS WHY THERE IS A BUST. YOU ARE PLAYING A LOT OF GUYS THAT HAVE NOT PLAYED A LOT OF JOBE IN FOR BRADBERRY. NOBODY PICKS THEM UP ON THE OTHER SIDE. AL: THE OTHER POINT FOR JOSEPH. IT IS A ONE POSSESSION GAME HALFWAY THROUGH THE FOURTH A GOOD ONE IN COUSINS AND COMPAN TURN IT INTO A ONE POSSESSION GAME AND IT IS NERVOUS TIME IN PHILADELPHIA RIGHT NOW. 27-21. EAGLES TO GET THE BALL. 7:41 LEFT IN REGULATION. JOSEPH TO SEND IT DOWN TO PE NNY. THE EAGLES RUNNING GAME HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS TONIGHT. KIRK: THEY HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB. AT THE BOX ARE GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION. -- THE BACKS ARE GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION. IT IS BEEN THE OFFENSIVE LINE THOUGH. GREAT PUSH. GREAT COMMUNICATION BECAUSE MINNESOTA IS MOVING AROUND SO MUCH. BUT NOW WE HAVE A SIX-POINT GAME AND THIS WILL BE A DIFFERENT ENERGY FROM THE VIKING DEFENSE. AL: WE START WITH A SEVEN YARD RUN. THE LAST DRIVE, PHILADELPHIA, 15 PLAYS FOR 44 TODO YARDS. NINE MINUTES AND NO POINTS. THEY HAD A FIRST AND 10 AT THE MINNESOTA 25 AND ENDED UP HUNTING AT THE 45. -- AND ENDED UP PUNTING AT THE 45. KIRK: WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT WOODY HAYES EARLIER? IT IS LIKE A GAME FROM THE 50'S OR 60'S. AL: FROM THE 30 SIX YARD LINE. HARRISON PHILLIPS MAKES THE KIRK: JOHNSON STICKING WITH THE RUN GAME. CONSISTENT. OLD RELIABLE. WORKING THE CLOCK. VIKINGS LINEBACKERS AND SAFETIES WILL HAVE TO KEEP WORKING TO OUTNUMBER THEM UPFRONT AND STOP THE RUN GAME. AL: TO THE OUTSIDE, SWIFT. IS HELD DOWN THERE BY JOSH. THE 41ST RUN OF THE NIGHT. THEY HAVE RUN FOR 205 YARDS. TIME OF POSSESSION, ALREADY SIX MINUTES TO 17. THAT IS WHAT THE RUN GAME DOES FOR YOU. KIRK: ONE BACK AND TWO TITANS. PHILADELPHIA LAST YEAR WAS THE TEAM THAT WOULD MIX THINGS UP. WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF TWO TIGHT END LOOKS TO GIVE THEM THAT EXTRA GAP. AL: SECOND DOWN. SWIFT FOR A COUPLE. TAKING AS MUCH TIME OFF THE PLAY CLOCK AS THEY CAN ALONG THE WAY KIRK: INTERESTING CALL FROM BRIAN JOHNSON. THE TEAM THAT LAST YEAR WOULD OFTEN GO FOR IT ON FOURTH AND SHORT. AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME, SIX, IF THEY DON'T MAKE IT HERE AND COME UP SHORT -- LET'S SEE WHAT THEY DO. AL: THIRD DOWN AND FIVE. LET THE PLAY CLOCK RUN DOWN TO SIX. JALEN HURTS THROWS. CAUGHT, BRO KIRK: NICE TIMING. JALEN HURTS THE LAST FEW TIMES HE HAS THROWN THE FOOTBALL, WATCH ON THE LEFT AND WATCH HOW HE WORKS OFF THE LEVERAGE OF THE IT IS ACTUALLY A BIG DEFENSIVE END OUT OF POSITION. YOU WILL TAKE THAT ALL DAY. HE DOES NOT HAVE A GOOD FEEL FOR SPACE OUT THERE AND ON THIRD DOWN, IT MAKES IT VERY EASY FOR JALEN HURTS TO GO TO ONE OF HIS FAVORITE TARGETS. AL: RUN THE PLAY CLOCK DOWN TO SEVEN AGAIN. SWIFT, FIRST DOWN AND A LOT MORE! INSIDE THE 20. INSIDE THE 10. OUT OF BOUNDS. KIRK: THE LEFT GUARD, DICKERSON. WATCH THE PUSH. HE GETS UP AND OPENS UP THE PLAY A CONTINUATION OF WHAT WE HAVE SEEN. SWIFT, WHO HAS BEEN AT TIMES HESITANT WAITING PATIENTLY. THIS TIME HE SHOWS HOW QUICKLY HE CAN ACCELERATE. THIS GUY IS A GOOD LOOKING BACK IN A CROWDED BACKFIELD BACK IN PHILADELPHIA WHERE HE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL. HE HAS TO BE FIRED OUT. AL: 165 ON THE NIGHT AND 43 ON FIRST AND GOAL. THE VIKINGS IN NO MAN'S LAND. THEY HAVE TIMEOUTS. WHAT DO YOU DO? THEY HAVE ALL THREE. THEY WILL TAKE A TIMEOUT HERE. W PEOPLE WILL BE COMPLAINING. BUT THEY WENT WITH WHAT WORKED IF THEY PUNCH IT IN, YOU ARE LOOKING AT A VICTORY. KIRK: SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. YOU HAVE TO WIN AND BE TAXI -- YOU. AL: TO THE OUTSIDE, TOUCHDOWN THEY TOOK THE BALL AT THEIR OWN 25 YARD LINE AND IT TOOK THEM ONLY ATE PLAYS, THREE AND A HALF MINUTES TO MAKE IT A TWO SCORE 169 YARDS FOR SWIFT. IF YOU HAVE HIM IN YOUR FANTASY LEAGUE, YOU ARE THRILLED. ELLIOT FOR THE POINT AFTER. KIRK: IT IS ONLY FITTING THAT THE YOUNG MAN WHO GREW UP AND WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL HERE AT SAINT JOE PREP IS HAVING THIS KIND OF NIGHT. HOW GREAT IS THAT RUN? IT SHOWS WHAT HE HAS DONE ALL THAT PLAY IS DESIGNED TO GO BEHIND JASON KELSEY. THIS KID IS SHOWING YOU THE VISION AND PATIENCE HE HAS. HE IS NOT JUST A GUY THAT WILL CATCH THE BALL IN THE BACKFIELD. HE IS SHOWING YOU DIFFERENT WAYS. HE HAS HAD A HECKUVA NIGHT. GOOD FOR HIM. AL: OK. ALL RIGHT, YEAH. HOW DID THAT WORK OUT BY THE WAY, HE DID THE SURGERY. KIRK: YOU ARE IN GOOD HANDS. AL: THAT IS DROPPED. THAT CREATED SUCH CONSTERNATION IN BOSTON. TOM BRADY SAID, I HAVE THIS YOUNG GUY IN LOS ANGELES AND I'M GOING TO HIM. AND WHEN KOBE BRYANT TORE HIS ACHILLES WITH THE LAKERS, KOBE BRYANT AT 11:00 THAT NIGHT CALLED THE DOCTOR AND SAID, YOU HAVE TO DO ME TOMORROW. KIRK: THAT IS GREAT BACKGROUND INFORMATION. WE ARE ALL PULLING FOR AARON RODGERS. WE CANNOT WAIT TO SEE HIM FIGHT BACK TO GET READY FOR NEXT YEAR. WHAT A CATCH. AL: TAKING IT AWAY FROM SLAY WHO CAN HARDLY BELIEVE HE GAVE UP THE COMPLETION. KIRK: PRETTY GOOD CONCENTRATION. THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN GOING BACK AND FORTH. COUSINS WITH A GREAT THROW. AL: COUSINS, A SHOULDER SHAKE. MATTISON MAKES THE CATCH. HE STAYS IN. IT WOULD HELP IF HE GOT OUT OF THERE IS A FLAG ON THE PLAY. >> HOLDING. OFFENSE, NUMBER 75. 10 YARD PENALTY. REPLAY FIRST DOWN. KIRK: THIS OFFENSIVE LINE HAS HAD ITS HANDS FIRST -- HANDS FULL ON THE RIGHT. FIRST TIME WE HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO CALL HIS NAME, GRAHAM. DID HE LIGHT OF THE ROOM WHEN HE WALKED INTO THE PRODUCTION MEETING YESTERDAY AFTERNOON? AL: ALWAYS DOES. KIRK: HE TOLD A GREAT STORY ABOUT THE ACHILLES INJURY HE HAD IN 2021. HIS FIGHT BACK AND HOW DETERMINED HE WAS TO BE A PART OF THIS FRANCHISE AND HOW GRATEFUL HE IS TO BE A P THIS. AL: ON THE FIRST AND 20. TY CHANDLER. SECOND AND LONG. ZACH CUNNINGHAM IN ON THE YOU HAVE THE PHILLIES SPECIAL, THE SUPER BOWL AGAINST NEW ENGLAND AND ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAD THE STRIP SACK OF TOM BRADY FROM GRAHAM TO CEMENT THE GAME LATE. THERE IS A STATUE OUTSIDE THE STADIUM. KIRK: HE APPRECIATED YOU TALKING ABOUT THAT. AL: COUSINS THROWS INTO THE HANDS OF MATTISON, THIRD AND 15. KIRK: BIG DROP. FLETCHER COX STILL PLAYING. SPEAKING OF VETERANS. THAT IS WHAT MAKES THIS PHILADELPHIA TEAM SO DANGEROUS. THE BALL GOES THROUGH HIS HANDS. YOU HAVE THESE VETERANS WITH SO MANY YOUNG PLAYERS. LIKE JALEN CARTER. CAUGHT AT THE 35 YARD LINE. THREE YARDS SHY OF THE FIRST DOWN IS TJ HOCKENSON. VIKINGS UP TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND COUSINS IS TRYING TO GET THE PLAY CALLED. THEY STILL HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS PLUS THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING. THEY WILL HAVE TO CONVERT HERE, HE GOES TO THE TIGHT END, HOCKENSON TO KEEP IT GOING. MORROW MAKES THE STOP. KIRK: COUSINS TRYING TO GET THE SNAP OFF BEFORE THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING AND GET AN EXTRA AL: 3, 2, HE GETS IT OFF. MATTISON, NICE MOVE TO THE 30 YARD LINE AND THAT IS WHERE THEY WILL PICK UPKIRK: TUA'S PERFORMA AND THAT FIREPOWER. MAC JONES AND PHIL O'BRIEN. COMPETITIVE. I THINK MAC JONES WILL FIT WITH WHAT BILLY O'BRIEN WANTS TO DO. IT IS A FORGOTTEN TEAM IN THAT DIVISION. AL: LAST YEAR, MATT PATRICIA IS NOW HERE AT PHILADELPHIA AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT. I'M SURE HE HAD A FEW WORDS OF WISDOM GOING INTO LAST WEEK'S KIRK: THAT WAS A HECK OF A HECKUVA GAME, ACTUALLY. AL: IT WAS. TWO TIME OUTS LEFT FOR MINNESOTA. KIRK: OFF TO HIS RIGHT. JUSTIN JEFFERSON. THE SAFETY OVER TOP TO HELP OUT, TO PROTECT. AL: FLAG. MATTISON LOOKS AND LOSES THE BALL AND THE EAGLES HAVE IT FOR THE MOMENT. PENDING THE CALL HERE, JUSTIN EVANS WINDS UP AT THE BOTTOM. THE FLAG IS DOWN AT THE LINE OF ABOUT. KIRK: I DON'T KNOW IF PHILADELPHIA LINED UP OFFSIDES. I THINK THAT MAY HAVE BEEN A AL: YEP. NO FUMBLE. >> OFFSIDE, DEFENSE. NUMBER 97 LINING UP IN THE NEUTRAL ZONE. AL: TALKING ABOUT GUYS LINING UP IN THE NEUTRAL ZONE. MORE OF A POINT OF EMPHASIS THAN IT USED TO BE. >> THEY REALLY WANT THEM TO START THE PLAY LEGALLY. HE IS CLEARLY IN THE NEUTRAL I THINK THE RIGHT TACKLE IS BACK A LITTLE. MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE OFFSET THOSE. AL: A LITTLE YING AND YANG. COUSINS OVER THE MIDDLE. IT IS BROKEN UP AT THE TWO YARD AND TAKING A SHOT THERE WAS HOCKENSON WITH JUSTIN EVANS. KIRK: EVANS, A QUICK REACTION. IF YOU ARE A VIKINGS FAN YOU'RE WONDERING IF IT WAS TOO QUICK OF AN ACTION TRYING TO HIT THE SEAM BETWEEN THE TWO SAFETIES. AL: HERE IS THE BANG BANG PLAY THAT TERRY WAS TALKING ABOUT FROM BEFORE. KIRK: TERRY IS GIVING IT A THUMBS UP AND IT IS CLEAN. OK. AL: SECOND DOWN AND FIVE. COUSINS, A SHOULDER SHAKE. HE THROWS. JEFFERSON, FIRST DOWN AND GOAL. RACING TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE SAVING THEIR TIMEOUTS AND THE CLOCK IS UNDER A MINUTE AND A KIRK: IT WAS NOT PLAYING MAN. COUSINS HAD TO PUT IT ON A ROPE AND HE GETS IT OVER SLAY AND IN FRONT OF THE SAFETY. AL: BLITZ,. INTO THE END ZONE FOR THE TJ HOCKENSON. WHAT A DRIVE CONVERTED A FOURTH DOWN ALONG THE WAY AND GOES 75 KIRK: THIS GAME MAY END AND PHILLY MAY WIN BUT IF I AM A VIKINGS FAN, YOU MAY BE DISAPPOINTED POTENTIALLY IF THEY LOSE THE GAME BUT I LOVE THEIR FIGHTING ALL THE WAY TO THE END TRYING TO DO ANYTHING THEY CAN TO GET BACK INTO THE GAME. AL: AND TRYING TO WITHSTAND FOUR TURNOVERS TONIGHT. JOSEPH. WE HAVE A SIX-POINT GAME. YOU LINE AND LET'S FACE IT COUSINS IS ON HIS THIRD LEFT HE IS SHOWING HIS LEADERSHIP. AL: HOW RARE AND ONSIDE KICK IS AND HOW RARE IT IS FOR THE KICKING TEAM TO RECOVER THAT ONSIDE KICK. IN A WAY YOU HAVE TO DO IT BECAUSE OF THE TWO TIMEOUTS. BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO GIVE UP ALMOST 40 SECONDS ON THE PLAY CLOCK AT SOME POINT. YOU COULD CALL TWO QUICK TIMEOUTS AND RUN IT DOWN TO 20 SECONDS OR LESS. AL: PHILADELPHIA WANTED TO SEE WHAT THE ALIGNMENT WAS WITH THE TIMEOUT. KIRK: MAYBE THIS IS COMMON WITH KICKERS. THEY SEE A TEE. IT IS PROPPED UP UNUSUALLY FOR AN ONSIDE KICK. I KNOW YOU ARE A SCRATCH GOLFER. IT IS LIKE GOING BACK TO THE GOLF GAME. AL: THESE DAYS I AM A HEALTHY SCRATCH. WHAT CAN I TELL YOU. KIRK: HONESTLY, HOW MANY DAYS OF GOLF DO YOU PLAY? AL: THESE DAYS? LIKE YOU, I'M WORKING TOO HARD. I'M NOT DOING 1800 GAMES. BUT ANYWAY, LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS AND WHICH WAY HE WILL GO WITH THE KICK. THE NEW RULES ARE THAT YOU HAVE TO LINED UP AN EVEN NUMBER OF GUYS ON BOTH SIDE. FIVE ON HIS LEFT AND FIVE ON HIS RIGHT. THE EAGLES HAVE SIX GUYS AT THE 45 YARD LINE. NINE IN YOUR PICTURE RIGHT JOSEPH COMES FORWARD WITH A HOP AND A SKIP. HE IS COVERED BY THE EAGLES AT THE 49 YARD LINE. THAT IS DEVONTA SMITH. YOU PUT THE GOOD HANDS PLAYER -- THE GOOD HANDS PEOPLE OUT ON THAT PLAY. KIRK: USUALLY YOU WAIT FOR THE THIRD BOUNCE AND IT POPS UP INTO THE AIR. THAT WAS MORE OF A TRYING TO USE THE SPIN TO MAKE THE BALL TAKE AN UNUSUAL BOUNCE. IT DOES NOT WORK OUT. AL: SO HERE NOW THE VIKINGS CAN TAKE THEIR TWO TIMEOUTS BUT BY THE TIME THEY GET THE BALL BACK, PHILLY HAS TO GIVE IT UP WITH ALMOST NO TIME LEFT ON THE CLOCK. AT THAT POINT, THE FORMATION -- SWIFT TAKES IT. A HUGE NIGHT. HIS HUGE NIGHT CONTINUES. 173 ON THE GROUND. IT FEEL LIKE THEY ARE PLAYING C+ TURNOVE FOUR TONIGHT. AL: THIRD AND SIX. THEY CANNOT STOP THE CLOCK. THE VIKINGS CANNOT. FOURTH DOWN. YOU CAN TAKE THE PLAY CLOCK DOWN TO ABOUT 15 SECONDS. AND LEAVE THE VIKINGS WITH NEXT TO NOTHING. I WILL SAY ONE THING -- I WANTED TO MENTION THIS EARLIER WITH HE HAS THE ALBATROSS ON HIS NECK , CANNOT WIN IN PRIME TIME. IF YOU SAW THE QUARTERBACK SERIES, IF YOU DON'T KNOW HIM YOU HAD TO COME AWAY ADMIRING AND LIKING THE GUY. HE AND PATRICK MAHOMES AND MARY YADA -- MARY YADA -- MARIOTTA DID THAT. >> FALSE START, OFFENSE, NUMBER 88. FIVE YARD PENALTY, FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: BECAUSE OF WHAT COUSINS GOES THROUGH IT HIS AGE AND HE WAS HIT MORE THAN ANY QUARTERBACK LAST YEAR, YOU CAN SEE HOW HE PUTS HIMSELF BACK TOGETHER AND IT IS PRETTY REMARKABLE. YOU SEE GOATHERD -- YOU SEE GOEDERT AND THEY PUNT THE FOOTBALL RIGHT AT MIDFIELD. AL: LOOKS OVER TOWARD THE BENCH -- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO WITH THIS? TAKE IT OUT OF BOUNDS? POOCH PUNT IT? THE EAGLES DON' THE EAGLES DON'T WANT THIS GAME TO END THE WAY A PREVIOUS GAME DID WHEN IT WENT TO OVERTIME. EVERYONE LOOKING AROUND GOING -- >> MINNESOTA DID DECLINE THE 10 SECOND RUNOFF. AL: YOU ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO ROLL OUT THAT 10 SECOND RUNOFF IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION. BRANDON POWELL IS BACK TO GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING WITH HE WILL. AND HE CANNOT GO VERY FAR. TACKLED AT THE 17 WITH SEVEN RINGO MAKES THE TACKLE. ONE DESPERATE PRAYER. WHICH THEY HAD ANSWERED WHEN THEY PLAYED IN BUFFALO LAST REMEMBER THAT GAME? KIRK: YOU KNOW JUSTIN JEFFERSON WILL GET ALL OF THE ATTENTION OF THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PLAYS WHERE YOU ARE SETTING UP THE DIFFERENT LAT RULES TO KEEP THE PL ALIVE. AL: THEY WILL ACTIVATE CASE CADE HIM FROM THE MINNESOTA MIRACLE LIKELY THE FINAL PLAY OF THE GAME BARRING A DEFENSE OF FOUL. BUT BEFORE THAT -- >> TIMEOUT, PHILADELPHIA. AL: THIS IS LIKE THE NBA. THE LAST TWO MINUTES IS LIKE A HALF HOUR. [WHISTLES] AL: I THINK THE STANFORD BAND IS OUT ON THE FIELD. KIRK: LET'S SEE WHAT H HIM. AL: A ONE-MAN RUSH. AS FAR AS HE CAN THROW IT. KNOCKED AWAY. JEFFERSON IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND THAT IS GOING TO DO IT. NOT PRETTY AS YOU SAY. THEY CAN PLAY BETTER AND THEY WILL BUT FOR THE MOMENT, THAT TEAM FOR NICK SORIANO HE IS 2-0 AND THE MINNESOTA VIKINGS ARE 0-2 AS WE BEGIN WEEK NUMBER TWO OF THE NFL SEASON. HANG IN THERE. THE GANG IS ALL SET TO WRAP THINGS UP FROM PHILADELPHIA. THE POST GAME SHOW COMING YOUR WAY ON
