FINGER ON HIS THROWING HAND. HE SAID HE SAW A LOOK IN HIS TEAM'S EYES. THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE IN HIM BECAUSE THEY SAY HE'S BEEN BUILDING IT THROUGH THESE FIVE YEARS, GOING UP AGAINST THE CHARGERS FIRST-TEAM DEFENSE. AUSTIN EKELER CALLDR. STICK BECAUSE HE GETS SURGICAL AND PRACTICE WITH HIS BALL PLACEMENT, MAKING SUPERSTAR THROWS. WE WILL SEE IF HE CAN DO IT ON THE PRIMETIME STAGE TONIGHT. AL: HIS MOMENT HAS ARRIVED. JUSTIN HERBERT HAS BEEN AN IRONMAN SINCE SHE WAS DRAFTED -- HE WAS DRAFTED IN 2020. HE WILL MISS THE REST OF THE SEASON. BRONCOS ARE RED-HOT. CHARGERS AND RAIDERS ARE EACH 5-8. RAIDERS WON THE TOSS. THEY WILL DEFER. CHARGERS TO RECEIVE. DANIEL CARLSON TO PUT IT IN THE AIR. AWAY WE GO FROM VEGAS. CAUGHT AT THE FIVE YARD LINE BY DAVIS. OUT OF TCU. DECENT RUN BACK TO THE 29 YARD LINE FOR THE ROOKIE. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT EASTON STICK. TALKED TO HIM A LOT IN THE PREGAME SHOW. NORTH DAKOTA STATE FOR FOUR YEARS. HE WAS THERE WHEN CARSON WENTZ WAS THERE. WHEN HE SHOWED UP AT SCHOOL, HE SLEPT ON A COUCH BASEMENTS. TREY LANCE SHOWED UP AS STICK WITH LEAVING. NORTH DAKOTA STATE WITH A LOT OF SUCCESS IN THE SUBDIVISION. ECKLER IS THE RUNNING BACK. HE GETS IT. PICKS UP ABOUT FIVE. DIABLO IN ON THE TACKLE. KIRK: THE GOOD THING FOR THE CHARGERS, IT'S BEEN A BENEFIT -- DIFFICULT PART OF THE YEAR, RUNNING THE FOOTBALL. A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOKED AT AUSTIN EKELER. HE LED THE NFL IN RUSHING LAST A LOT OF IT HAS BEEN THE OFFENSIVE LINE. YOU CAN SPECIFICALLY LOOK OUT ON THE EDGES OF THE TIGHT ENDS. THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO A BETTER JOB TONIGHT RUNNING THE FOOTBALL AND TAKING THE PRESSURE OFF OF STICK. AL: STICK SETS IT UP HERE. ECKLER WILL TAKE IT UP TO THE 38 YARD LINE. THIRD DOWN AND SHORT. YOU WILL SEE THAT MANNING IN YOUR FRAME A LOT TONIGHT. MAX DRAW IS NUMBER 98. KIRK: ALL OF US LOVE THIS ABOUT HIM. WATCH THE EFFORT. RECOGNITION. THE BALL IS OUT. LOOK IN HIS EYES. LOOK AT THE CLOSING SPEED. NEVER TAKES THE PLAYOFF. MAYBE -- WHETHER IT'S THE RUN OR THE PASS, HE DOES IT ALL. AL: THIRD AND 3. OVER THE METAL -- MIDDLE. INCOMPLETE. TRIED TO GET IT INTO GERALD EVERETT. THE CHARGERS BEGIN WITH A THREE AND OUT. ANTONIO PIERCE IS THE INTERIM HEAD COACH. TOOK OVER WHEN JOSH MCDANIELS GOT FIRED HALFWAY THROUGH THE HE WON THE FIRST TWO GAMES BUT HAS LOST HIS LAST THREE. KIRK: THIS WEEK, HE TALKED ABOUT, EMBARRASSED AND DISAPPOINTED. HE SAID, THESE GUYS ARE PROS. IT HAS REALLY HELPED GET THROUGH SOME OF THESE BUMPY MOMENTS AL: JK SCOTT IN TO PUNT. DEANDRE CARTER BACK TO RECEIVE. STANDING INSIDE HIS OWN 15 YARD LINE. FAIR CATCH CALLED FOR. AND THEN THE CONTACT IS A FLAG. ANOTHER FLAG. RUNNING INTO HIM WAS JOSHUA TAYLOR. SO TAYLOR, NOT GIVING HIM THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE FAIR CATCH. THAT WILL COST HIM. RONALD TORBERT IS THE REFEREE TONIGHT. >> FAIR CATCH INTERFERENCE. NUMBER 36. 10 YARD PENALTY. LAS VEGAS'S BALL. FIRST AND 10. AL: SO THE RAIDERS NOW -- HERE IS AIDAN O'CONNELL. THIS HAS TO BE A BIT OF A NIGHTMARE FOR HIM. HE STARTED AGAINST THE CHARGERS IN L.A. WEEK FOUR. WHAT HAPPENED? HE GOT SACKED SEVEN TIMES IN THE GAME. SIX TIMES BY THAT MAN KHALIL MACK. THIS IS A NIGHTMARE. KIRK: HIS FIRST START IS AGAINST KHALIL MACK. SIX SACKS AND HERE WE ARE AGAIN. AL: JOSH JACOBS, BACK. HE'S OUT TONIGHT. HE WILL START HERE WITH A RUN TO THE 40 YARD LINE. HE WILL BE THE MAIN GUY SECOND-YEAR GUY OUT OF GEORGIA, YEAR. KIRK: HE'S VERY DIFFERENT STYLE. JOSH JACOBS OBVIOUSLY HAD SOME SHAKE SIDE TO SIDE JUMP CUTS. HE'S A DOWNHILL RUNNER. ONE CUT AND GET NORTH AND SOUTH. YOU SAW THAT THERE ON CARRY. GREAT BLOCK UPFRONT BY JAKOB JOHNSON. AL: DAVE DROP. DEEP THROW. KNOWING DEEP DOWN. COVERAGE IS THERE. MICHAEL DAVIS COVERING ON THE PLAY. COVERING FOR THE OUT OF CINCINNATI. THIRD DOWN AND 2. KIRK: THEY FELT THEY HAD SOME OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE SPEED OF TUCKER. THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD GO TO IT EARLY. HE WINS AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. HE HAS A CHANCE TO PUT A BIG PLAY UP ON THE BOARD. THE BALL BRINGS HIM BACK. DAVIS CATCHES THE BREAK. THREE RECEIVERS TO THE FIELD. ONE BACK TO THE BOUNDARY TO CREATE THAT ONE-ON-ONE MATCHUP. THEY MISSE THERE. KIRK: THIRD DOWN -- AL: THIRD DOWN AND 2. DOWN OF THE GAME. KEEPING THOSE THE -- LEGS MOVING. WITHOUT JACOBS, THAT'S A BIG LOSS. IT'S AMEER ABDULLAH. HE AND WHITE CARRY THE TONIGHT ON THE GROUND. KIRK: KNOWN FOR HIS ABILITY TO CATCH THE BALL. THE ROCK. AL: FIRST DOWN. TO THE OUTSIDE. THAT'S BROKEN UP. INTENDED FOR DAVANTE ADAMS. HE CAME HERE LAST YEAR AND WANTED TO REUNITE WITH DEREK CARR. IT'S BEEN A TOUGH SEA RIGHT NOW. KIRK: IT SURE HAS. HE'S BEEN FRUSTRATED FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. HERE, JUST REALLY GOOD COVERAGE BY SAMUEL. THE RAIDERS THROUGH SECOND SHORT. THEY TAKE THE SHOT DOWNFIELD. FIRST AND 10 BOTH TIMES. HE HAD TIME TO THROW. AL: WHY NOT TAKE SOME CHANCES AT THIS POINT OF THE SEASON? FIRED OVER THE MIDDLE. THAT'S CAUGHT. TAKING INTO THE 47 YARD LINE. ADAMS MAKING THE GRAB AFTER SOME STELLAR YEARS WITH AARON RODGERS AT GREEN BAY. NOW IN HIS SECOND SEASON HERE. KIRK: THEY MOVE HIM AROUND. THEY DO A GOOD JOB OF DOING THAT. THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO CREATE MATCH UPS AND PREVENT TEAMS FROM LOADING UP ON HIM AND ROLLING COVERAGE TOWARD HIM. HE'S HAD A BRILLIANT CAREER. ONE THING ABOUT HIM IS THAT THEY GAVE HIM SO MUCH FREEDOM AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. WORKING THE OTHER WAY. AL: THIRD AND 2. NICE RUN HERE. ERIC KENDRICKS MAKES THE TACKLE FOR THE CHARGERS. KIRK: HE DOESN'T NICE JOB. SHOWS THAT IT'S A DRAW SETS UP. NICE KICK OUT BLOCK ON JOSEPH DAY. THE TIGHT END COMING AROUND MICHAEL MAYER. JUST LIKE THAT, THE OFFENSIVE LINE OPENING UP SOME ROOM FOR THESE BACKS. AL: ON THE GROUND. NOTHING HAPPENING THERE. HE'S -- THIS IS HIS 11TH SEASON IN THE LEAGUE. MOST OF THEM WITH NEW ENGLAND. OWNS A COUPLE OF RINGS. KIRK: ONE OF THE REOCCURRING THEMES WE SEE IN THE NFL IS RESHUFFLING OFFENSIVE LINEMAN. THAT'S WHAT THE RAIDERS HAVE TO DO TONIGHT. THEY HAVE SOME INJURIES TO THEIR STARTING CENTER. MILLER IS OUT. YOU CAN SEE THEY'VE HAD TO RESHUFFLE THE DECK. EVEN THE RIGHT TACKLE WAS HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN PLAYING TONIGHT EITHER. AL: FIRST CARRY OF THE YEAR. THEY'VE ALREADY USED THREE RUNNING BACKS. HUNTER RENFROW MAKING THAT. WOULD HAVE BEEN A SEVEN YARD GAIN. BRANDON STALEY IN HIS THIRD PENALTY -- PENALTY WILL BE AGAINST LOS ANGELES. >> OUTSIDE. DEFENSE NUMBER THREE. FIVE YARD PENALTY. AL: BRANDON STALEY TOOK OVER IN THE 2021 SEASON. ANY TIME YOU HAVE A DISAPPOINTING SEASON LIKE THIS WERE SO MUCH AS EXPECTED, THE COACH WILL BE ON THE HOT SEAT. THEY WILL ASSESS AT THE END OF THE SEASON AND WE WILL FIND OUT ABOUT HIS FUTURE OF A LOT OF OTHER GUYS. KIRK: THINK ABOUT THIS. AUSTIN EKELER, KEENAN ALLEN, MIKE WILLIAMS. THREE OF THEIR STARS. THEY FALL BEEN AT THE -- ON THE FIELD AT THE SAME TIME ONLY 9% OF THE TIME. AL: ALAN IS OUT TONIGHT. CAUGHT. MISS THE WALK-THROUGH YESTERDAY WITH AN ILLNESS. LOOKING SHARP KIRK: THEY BRING THE LINEBACKERS AND THAT GAVE HIM ROOM TO IN THE MIDDLE. PRESSURE HERE. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO WIN THIS. NOBODY IS GOING TO STOP HIM AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. LOOK AT THE ROOM BECAUSE OF THE LINEBACKER BLADES. GREAT RECOGNITION TO GET THE BALL OUT OF HIS HANDS QUICKLY WITH THAT FAVORABLE MATCH UP TO GUY. AL: GAIN OF 23. CHARGERS WITH THREE OF THAT. MEANWHILE, VEGAS NOW RUNNING THE NINTH PLAY OF THEIR OPENING DRIVE. FOR RUNS, FOUR PASSES. HERE'S PASS NUMBER FIVE. INCOMPLETE TO THE OUTSIDE. ONCE THE FLAG. DON'T GET IT. JACOBY MYERS, SECOND DOWN. KIRK: DAVIS AND SAN BOTH SITTING ON THE SHORT ROUTES. THE SCOUTING REPORT ON O'CONNELL IS THAT THEY DON'T GET THE BALL DOWNFIELD A LOT. A LOT OF IT IS UNDERNEATH. BECAUSE OF THAT, THEY ARE JUMPING THE ROUTES. THE OFFICIAL TAKING A CLOSE LOOK. IT LOOKS LIKE HE GOT THERE EARLY BUT IT'S NO CALL ON THE FIELD. THAT'S WHY THEY TOOK THE SHOT TO TUCKER ON THE SECOND PLAY OF THE AL: SECOND AND 10. BATTED AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. HE GOT HIS HANDS ON IT, TRYING TO FLIP IT TO THE OUTSIDE. IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 10. MAC LEADING THE LEAGUE IN SACKS. CROSBY IS ONLY 1.5 BEHIND HIM. A LITTLE INDIVIDUAL DUAL KIRK: YOU KNOW HOW FIRED UP HE GETS ANYTIME HAS A CHANCE TO GO UP AGAINST HIS FORMER TEAM. IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME HE HAS A BIG GAME AGAINST THIS THIS OFFENSE. AL: HAVING A GREAT SERIES. THIRD DOWN AND 10. O'CONNELL FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE. THAT IS CAUGHT. FIRST DOWN. MICHAEL MAYER, THE ROOKIE OUT OF NOTRE DAME, THEY PICKED HIM IN THE SECOND ROUND, SETS UP A FIRST DOWN AND RAIDERS. KIRK: THE MOTION BY JACOBY MYERS WIDENS THE BACKER AND OPENS UP THE THROW. WATCH THE MOTION COME AND WATCH THE BACKER RESPOND TO IT. HE WILL END UP FLOATING OUT. ONCE HE WIDENS, THERE'S THE TIGHT END. NICE JOB OF TAKING THAT SPACE. GOOD JOB BY THE OFFENSIVE LINE KEEPING KHALIL MACK OUT. MUMFORD ON THE LEFT SIDE, GETTING A LITTLE INSIDE THERE. INTO THE END ZONE FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. THE RAIDERS WHO WERE BLANKED ON SUNDAY AND COULDN'T SCORE FOR THE LAST THREE QUARTERS OF THEIR GAME BEFORE THAT, ALL OF A SUDDEN LOOK LIKE A JUGGERNAUT. 68 YARDS. BEAUTIFULLY EXECUTED. KIRK: SEE HIM SAYING, NICE JOB. THAT'S EXACTLY WHY THEY TALKED ABOUT GETTING SHUT OUT. THEY JUST WANTED TO GET BACK ON THE FIELD AND HAVE A CHANCE TO PUT POINTS UP ON THE BOARD. THEY DO IT ON THE FLAWLESS OPENING DRIVE. AL: HIS SECOND YEAR OUT THAT'S HIS FIRST CAREER DANIEL CARLSON FOR THE POINT AFTER. AJ COLE IS THE HOLDER. SO THE RAIDERS HAVE THE BALL FOR ALMOST FIVE MINUTES. BEAUTIFULLY EXECUTED DRIVE. LAS VEGAS LEADS 7-0. DEFENSIVE LINE, THE O WHEREVER YOU NEED HIM. KIRK: WHAT A DRIVE. AL: FIRST TIME SINCE THE SEC QUARTER AGAINST KANSAS CITY THREE WEEKS AGO. HE HAD A BYE WEEK IN BETWEEN AS WELL. COMING UP IN THE END ZONE IS DERRIUS KINGS. 21 YARD LINE. SOME NOTES ABOUT HIM. 49-3 WAS HIS RECORD AT NORTH DAKOTA STATE. FOUR-TIME FCS NATIONAL CHAMPION. TWO AS A STARTER AND TWO AS A STARTER AND TO AS A BACKUP. PICKED IN THE FIFTH ROUND IN 2019. TONIGHT IS HIS FIRST CAREER START. CAN YOU IMAGINE, YOU DON'T COME INTO A GAME FOR ALMOST FIVE THE CATCH IS MADE ON THE OUTSIDE. KIRK: I'M WITH YOU. THINK ABOUT THIS. HIS FIRST FOUR YEARS WITH CHASE DANIEL, THEY WERE THE BACKUP QUARTERBACK TO JUSTIN HERBERT. HE'S BASICALLY THE THIRD GUY. NEVER ACTIVE. NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT. AND THEN HE KEEPS IN THE SHADOWS , WORKING TO GET BETTER AS A PASSER. HE'S REALLY ATHLETIC, INTELLIGENT. IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WERE READY TO MAKE HIM THE BACKUP THIS YEAR. AL: RUNNING BACK IS JOSHUA KELLEY. HE CAN GETS OUT OF BOUNDS AFTER HE PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN. KEPT PICKS UP THE FIRST. KIRK: TO A CERTAIN DEGREE, YOU WILL HAVE TO HAVE BACKYARD FOOTBALL TONIGHT BY STAKE. IT'S HIS FIRST CAREER START. HE'S BEEN IN THE LEAGUE FOR FIVE HERE COMES THE RUSH. NOW YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE IMPROVISE. INSTEAD OF THROWING IT AWAY, HE KEEPS HIS EYES UPFIELD AND FINDS THE TIGHT END. AL: FROM THE 48. ON THE GROUND. STUFFED. KELLY RIGHT THERE. DIABLO MAKING THE TACKLE. KIRK: WE DID OUR ZOOM THIS WEEK WITH EASTON STICK. KAYLEE ASKED HIM A QUESTION. BESIDE YOUR PARENTS, WHO HAS HELPED YOU THE MOST? HE BROUGHT UP HIS COLLEGE COATS -- COACH WHO IS THE KANSAS STATE ACTUALLY GOT EMOTIONAL AND APOLOGIZED. HE SAID HE INSTILLED CONFIDENCE IN ME AS A FRESHMAN WHEN I REALLY NEEDED IT. I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT. IT'S COO ALL THESE YEARS LATER. THAT BALL IS OUT. 42 YARD LINE. RAIDERS THINK THEY HAVE IT AND THEY DO. MALCOLM KOONCE COMES IN AND GETS THE SACK, FORCES THE FUMBLE. LAS VEGAS TAKES OVER. TYREE WILSON, ROOKIE OUT OF TEXAS TECH, WITH THE RECOVERY. KIRK: 41 ON THE BLITZ. THAT CREATES THE ONE-O OPPORTUNITY. GETTING BETTER AND BETTER ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF MAXX CROSBY. A LOT OF PEOPLE ABOUT -- WORRY ABOUT PUTTING TWO BLOCKERS ON CROSBY FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. NOW HAS THREE SACKS ON THE YEAR. FOUR TACKLES FOR A LOSS. HE HAS BETTER TECHNIQUE. ALWAYS BEEN ATHLETIC. PATRICK GRAHAM SAID, HE BOUGHT INTO THE TECHNICAL AT -- OF BEING A PASS RUSHER IT'S PAYING OFF. AL: HE WENT TO THE SAME SCHOOL THAT PRODUCED KHALIL MACK BUFFALO. KIRK: NOT BAD. AL: MORE THERE HE IS. FORCES THE TURNOVER. MEANWHILE, AFTER THAT PERFECT FIRST DRIVE, O'CONNELL COMES BACK IN. PICKED HIM IN THE FOURTH ROUND. IT WAS GOING TO BE JIMMY GARROTTE BELOW WHO HE WAS GOING TO COME TO TOWN AND BE THE GUY. ZAMIR WHITE IS THE RUNNING BACK. TWO YARD GAIN. KIRK: MICHAEL MAYOR JUST GOT INTRODUCED TO MACK AND HOW QUICK HE IS. IT'S ONE THING TO STUDY AND HEAR ABOUT IT. NOW YOU HAVE TO TRY TO BLOCK HIM AND HE'S GONE. YOU CAN'T EVEN GET YOUR HANDS ON KHALIL MACK, I THINK HE'S HAVING ONE OF HIS BEST YEARS HE'S HAD IN HIS ENTIRE CAREER. THINK ABOUT GETT 10TH YEAR. 32 YEARS OLD. PEOPLE START TO THINK THAT YOU LOSE A LITTLE BIT. IN KHALIL MACK'S CASE IT'S THE HE'S GOTTEN BETTER. AL: PLAYING AGAINST THE TEAM THAT DRAFTED HIM. THAT PASS IS INCOMPLETE. MICHAEL DAVIS IS IN AND OUT OF THE LINEUP. ADAMS LOOKING FOR A FLAG. DOESN'T GET IT. DAVIS IS A START BEEN INVOLVED IN ACTION ALREADY. KIRK: HE'S HAVING A FEW WORDS WITH ADAMS. ADAMS WAS WORKING THE OFFICIAL. HE SAID, YOU HAVE TO BEAT ME. DAVIS HAS THE LENGTH TO BE ABLE TO TRY TO STAY WITH HIM. THAT WAS TIGHT COVERAGE ON THE BACK SHOULDER FADE. HE WAS RIGHT THERE STRIDE FOR STRIDE. AL: THIRD AND 8. THE CROWD BOOING AS THEY WATCH THE REPLAY. THIRD AND EIGHT. THAT PASS IS CAUGHT. FIRST DOWN AT THE 30 YARD LINE. MICHAEL MAYOR. KIRK: RIGHT BACK TO HIM. HE GOT IT EARLIER ON A CRITICAL THIRD DOWN. HE COMES RIGHT BACK TO HIM. A GREAT MATCH AGAINST ERIC KENDRICKS. YOU FEEL THE COVERAGE. WORKS FROM THE OUTSIDE BACK TO THE INSIDE. THE TIMING I LET'S NOT FORGET TO GIVE THE OFFENSIVE LINE CREDIT ON THOSE THIRD DOWNS, GIVING THEM ENOUGH TIME TO EVALUATE THAT COVERAGE AND MAKE THE THROW. AL: GOOD PROTECTION. GOING FOR THE END ZONE. OPEN. TREY TUCKER WITH A TOUCHDOWN. KIRK: HOW ABOUT THAT? ANYTIME YOU HAVE A DEEP CROSSER YOU NEED PROTECTION. THE OFFENSIVE LINE DELIVERS TUCKER WAS KNOWN FOR HIS SPEED IN COLLEGE AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI. HE GETS ACROSS AND HE'S ABLE TO PULL AWAY. HE'S LEAVING HIM. ALL OF IT BECAUSE OF THE OFFENSIVE LINE, GIVING HIM ENOUGH TIME THAT HE BOBBLED IT. HE DID ONCE. GETS THE FOOT DOWN. WOW. CLOSE. AL: IT' AL: IT'S GOOD. TREY TUCKER, THE ROOKIE. KIRK: THERE'S KHALIL MACK WITH A LITTLE EXTRA ATTENTION THERE. HELPING OUT THE RIGHT TACKLE. AL: TUCKER GETS HIS FIRST CAREER KIRK: GREAT LOOK AT IT. A LITTLE BOBBLE. IT'S LIKE THE RIGHT FOOT STILL BE DOWN. FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. AL: THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE DELAY ON THE EXTRA POINT. WAITING FOR CONFIRMATION. KIRK: IT'S ALL ABOUT THE RIGHT FOOT STILL BEING DOWN. DID HE LOSE POSSESSION OR REGAIN IT? >> IT IS UNDER REVIEW. IT. OK. ALL RIGHT. BACK WITH THE VERDICT AFTER THIS. THE RULING >> ON THE FIELD >> STANDS AS CALLED -- >> THE CALLED. AL: IT'S ABOUT AS CLOSE AS IT GETS TO GETTING CONTROL, GETTING THE RIGHT TOE DOWN. THE LEFT FOOT CLEARLY AND. THE CALL ON THE FIELD STANDS. SO, TWO TOUCHDOWN DRIVES ALREADY FOR THE RAIDERS. KIRK: THAT'S ONE YOU ARE GLAD YOU ARE NOT AT THE REPLAY BOOTH. THAT WAS AS CLOSE A I'VE SEEN IT. AL: EXTRA POINT. THAT MAKES IT 14-0. TAKE US THROUGH THE TOUCHDOWN HERE. >> IT'S WHEN THAT CLEAR AND OBVIOUS STANDARD COMES IN. WHEN HE GAINS FOUL CONTROL, IT HAS TO BE CLEAR AND OBVIOUS THAT THE RIGHT TO IS UP. IT JUST ISN'T. IT'S THERE. PROBABLY NOT. IT'S NOT CLEAR AND OBVIOUS THAT IT'S NOT A TOUCHDOWN HAS RULED ON THE FIELD. AL: WHEN IS THE LAST TIME WE SAW ANYTHING THAT WAS CLEAR AND OBVIOUS? TOE CLEARLY AND. KIRK: THE CHARGERS DEFENSE ALLOWED SIX POINTS ALL YEAR ON JUST OPENING DRIVES. THAT'S THE BEST IN THE NFL. THEY ARE DOWN 14-0 WITH STICK MAKING HIS FIRST WITH MAXX CROSBY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BALL. AL: WITH THAT DEFENSE, HE CAME FROM THE RAMS WHERE HE RAN THE DEFENSE UNDER SEAN MCVAY. 29TH AND YARDS, 29TH AND PASSING. LAST WEEK, 12 POSSESSIONS, NO POINTS TONIGHT, TO POSSESSIONS FOR THE TEAM. HOLE. THEY WILL BEGIN THIS NEXT DRIVE FROM THE 25 YARD LINE. KIRK: WITH STICK AT THIS POINT, YOU HAVE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS ATHLETIC ABILITY. RUN HIM -- AT HIM INTO THE RUN JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE THE DEFENSE AWARE OF IT. BOOTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WERE HE'S REALLY COMFORTABLE. IT'S NOT JUST SITTING IN THE POCKET AND RELYING ON THE RUNNING GAME. YOU CAN DEFINITELY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS YOUNG MAN'S LEGS. AL: STARTED ON THE GROUND. TO THE 30 YARD LINE. THAT BALL IS OUT AS WELL. RAIDERS THINK THEY HAVE IT. HERE COME THE OFFICIALS. OH BOY. JERRY TILLERY. ONE TIME CHARGER COMES UP WITH HE SAW A NIGHTMARE BEGINNING FOR THE CHARGERS. KIRK: HE GOT HIS LEFT HAND GOT IT LOSE. AS HE WAS GOING DOWN, THE BALL FALLS OUT OF KELLY. THEY FELT LIKE ISAIAH SPILLER MIGHT BE MOVING CLOSER TO BECOMING THAT SECOND BACK THIS NOW WITH KELLY GETTING THE OPPORTUNITY, THE BALL IS ON THE GROUND. THEY WENT RIGHT FOR THE CHARGERS HERE EARLY. >> -- AL: TWO TURNOVERS IN THE FIRST 10 AND A HALF MINUTES. WHITE BEHIND THE FULLBACK HERE. THE DRIVE STARTING FROM THE 31 THE WHISTLE BEFORE THE SNAP. >> FALSE START. OFFENSE. NUMBER 16. AL: THE BEST THING T HAPPENED TO THE CHARGERS SO FAR JACOBY MYERS, FALSE START. I RAN INTO JIM PLUNKETT BEFORE THE GAME. IT LOOKS LIKE HE WILL PICK UP RAIDERS OF YOUR. KIRK: THIS IS A TEAM THAT DIDN'T SCORE LAST WEEK. 29 YARD LINE. TUCKER JUST SCORED THE TOUCHDOWN, MAKING THE GRAB HERE. KIRK: WHAT YOU ARE SEEING FROM O'CONNELL, WHEN HE HAS TIME TO THROW AND HIS FEET ARE SET AND THINGS ARE CLEAN, THE BALL C OUT. IT'S ACCURATE. HERE'S A GUY THAT DIDN'T START UNTIL HIS SENIOR YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND/OR NINTH STRING. HERE HE IS AS A ROOKIE. AL: IT'S BEEN SIX YEARS. HE HAD ONE HEAD COACH. COMES HERE. FIRES THE HEAD COACH HALFWAY THROUGH THE SEASON. LOUISVILLE. 28 STARTS. HE TALKED ABOUT ALL THOSE REPS HE RECEIVED. ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES. THEY THREW THE BALL 40 TIMES AGAIN. REALLY ALLOWED HIM TO TRANSITION INTO THIS NFL SYSTEM. OBVIOUSLY MOVING FAST. HE IS STILL LEARNING ABOUT THE NFL WINDOW. MUCH BETTER. A SHOT OF JIMMY GARROTTE BELOW ON THE SIDELINE. THIRD DOWN AND TWO. THE BLITZ IS COMING. REACHED FOR AND PULLED INTO THE THREE PLAYS, 31 YARDS, CASHING IN ON ANOTHER TURNOVER. THREE TOUCHDOWN LEAD FOR VEGAS. KIRK: ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE CATCH BY MYERS. WHEN HE GETS HIS FEET SET, YOU GIVE YOUR RECEIVER A CHANCE. MICHAEL DAVIS HAS BEEN PICKED ON A LOT THIS YEAR. WATCH HIM PEEK BACK. LOOKING OVER HIS RIGHT SHOULDER RIGHT THERE. THAT'S WHERE HE LOST THE PLAY. MYERS GOES RIGHT BY HIM. HE MADE THAT MISTAKE AND IT COST AL: COMES OVER FROM NEW ENGLAND. FIRST YEAR HERE. SEVENTH TOUCHDOWN OF THE SEASON. WHO ARE THESE GUYS? WHO ARE THESE GUYS RIGHT NOW? 21-0. HERE IS THE THURSDAY SPOTLIGHT PRESENTED BY PEPSI. SAC FUMBLE HERE. VEGAS TAKES OVER. GOES TO THE END ZONE. YOU HAVE A FUMBLE HERE BY KELLY. THIRD DOWN AND ONE. INTO THE END ZONE. GREAT CATCH BY THE FORMER PATRIOT JACOBY MYERS. KIRK: THAT'S WHY THEY PLAYS -- PLAY THESE GAMES. THE RAIDERS HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS AT -10. THOSE TURNOVERS H POINTS. WE GO TO KAYLEE. KAYLEE: MYERS TOLD ME THAT WHEN HE SAW THE THROWS IN CAMP, HE KNEW THE ROOKIE WAS DO. HE FIGURED IT WAS A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE HE'D GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW IT. HE SAYS, O'CONNELL HAS SHOWN HOW MENTALLY STRONG HE IS AS HE'S BEEN THRUST INTO A NEW SITUATION MYERS SMILES AS HE TOLD ME, I'M PROU THINGS. AL: IT'S A DREAM GETTING FOR H A NIGHTMARES AS FAR FOR T CHARGERS. STARTING FROM THE 27 YARD LINE. ECKLER IN THE BACKFIELD. GAVE IT TO HIM. REVERSES HIS DIRECTION. 31. YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY DRAFT O'CONNELL -- FLAG DOWN HERE. OFFENSIVE BACKFIELD. PICKED IN THE FOURTH ROUND OUT OF PURDUE. >> HOLDING. NUMBER 77. AL: WHEN THEY DRAFTED HIM, GARROTTE BELOW WILL BE THE GUY. THEY ALREADY DEALT CAR TO NEW ORLEANS. GARROTTE BELOW, THEY GET HIM FROM SAN FRANCISCO. BRIAN HOYER IS GOING TO BE THE BACKUP. THERE'S GARROTTE BELOW. KIRK: HE GOES FROM THREE TO GETTING A START WEEK FOR WHICH I THINK SHOCKED HIM. THEN HE GOES BACK TO BEING THREE. THEN EVENTUALLY WORKS HIS TO BEING A BACKUP. THEY FIRE JOSH MCDANIELS AND HE TAKES OVER. AL: TONIGHT HE'S ON FIRE. EVERETT MAKES THE GRAB. THE BALL IS OUT AGAIN. THIS TIME, FORTUNATELY FOR THE CHARGERS, THEY RECOVER. KIRK: I THINK HE WAS DOWN. ATTACKING THE FOOTBALL. AL: THEY CALLED IT A FUMBLE. THAT'S WHAT TORBERT JUST SAID. KIRK: LET'S TAKE A PEEK OF THAT. AL: EITHER WAY, THEY KEEP POSSESSION. HE'S HAD A GREAT SEASON. SECOND DOWN AND 10. HERE'S EVERETT. HE'S GOT BLOCKING IN FRONT. GOOD STEP. HE PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN. FRUSTRATION. KIRK: YOU CAN SENSE THAT. HE ENDED UP THROWING A ROBERTSON -- THROWING ROBERTSON. THE HELMET AND ARM. ALL THE MOMENTUM. JUST OVERPOWERS HIM. THAT GAVE HIM THE FIRST DOWN. IT'S BEEN THAT KIND OF YOUR FOR A LOT OF FRUSTRATION. AL: GOING TO HIS LEFT. HE THROWS. SHAKES IT OFF UNDERNEATH. BANGED OUT OF BOUNDS. SO SMART. SECOND-YEAR GUY OUT OF OLD DOMINION. KIRK: THE OFFENSIVE COURT NADER WHO CAME OVER FROM DALLAS, YOU SAW THE SCREEN TO EVERETT. GET THE BALL OUT, TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PASS RUSH OF CROSBY AND COMPANY. THIS TIME, THEY USE HIS ATHLETIC ABILITY TO GET YOU DON'T WANT HIM SITTING BACK IN THE POCKET. HE' HE'S A SITTING DUCK. AL: CHOKING AHEAD FOR YARD AND A HALF AND SETTING UP A THIRD DOWN IS AUSTIN EKELER. KIRK: LET'S SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO HERE ON THE THIRD DOWN. HIS LEGS COULD BE A FACTOR HERE AS FAR AS MOBILITY AND HIS ABILITY TO IMPROVISE. WHEN A QUARTERBACK IS MAKING HIS FIRST START, YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN AND YOU HAVE TO JUST STICK WITH WHAT YOU SAW MIGHT BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY. YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THESE PASSING GAMES. AL: INTO THE CORNER APPROACHING THIRD AND 5. LOOK OUT. SAC. THAT'S THE WAY THE FIRST QUARTER WILL AND, ON A SACK. 21-0 RAIDERS AFTER ONE. NOW A SPECIAL LOOK AT DOOM PART TWO. AL: BACK IN VEGAS ON THURSDAY NIGHT. THE RAIDERS HAVE NOT DONE MUCH WINNING OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES BUT THEY LOOK FANTASTIC MEMORIAL BROWN DAVIS FROM OAKLAND IN 2020. MARK DAVIS RUNNING THE OPERATION. A PUNT OFF THE FOOT OF JK SCOTT AND CARTER BACK TO THE RECEIVING SIDE OF THE 15 YARD LINE. FAIR CATCH CALLED FOR, MADE AT THE 17 YARD LINE. KIRK: WE WONDERED HOW THE OFFENSIVE LINE WOULD HOLD UP WITHOUT JOSH JACOBS ABLE TO RUN THE BALL WITH THEY HOLD UP PASS PROTECTION? THEY HAD SEVEN SACKS, SIX BY MAC ALONE AND THEY ARE GIVING TIME TO GO DOWN FIELD, THEY'VE HIT BIG PLAYS DOWNFIELD. SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN MISSING FOR THE OFFENSE. AL: 21 IN THE FIRST QUARTER AND STARTING AT THE 18 YARD LINE THEY'VE HAD EIGHT FIRST DOWNS AND 141 YARDS. NOT MUCH THERE. MAKING THE TACKLE ON WHITE. KIRK: FIRST TIME IN HIS CAREER AS A COACH. IMAGINE MIDSEASON TRYING TO PICK THAT UP. HE SAID THE GREATEST THING WITH O'CONNELL IS HE HANDLES EVERYTHING AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND HE CALLED UP MIKE AND THE DEFENSE MOVES AROUND. HE IS IN COMMAND AND THAT HELPS THE OFFENSIVE LINE. IN COMMAND, HELPING OUT. AL: JAMES. LOOK OUT FROM BEHIND, MACK ALMOST HAD THE SACK. MCDANIELS THE HEAD COACH, THEY FIRED HIM. THEY FIRED MCCLUNG VARDY. HE HAS BEEN CALLING PLAYS FROM THE FIELD AND IS UPSTAIRS FOR I THINK HE WILL STAY THERE. KIRK: I ASKED HIM LAST NIGHT DO YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE? HE SAID I LEARNED ON THE FLY, I'M LEARNING SOMETHING NEW EVERY WEEK AND SO FAR I HAVE NOT RUN OUT OF TIME. THE RHYTHM HAS GONE WELL AND IT HELPS HAVING A CEREBRAL GUY EVEN THOUGH HE IS A ROOKIE. AL: VEGAS TAKES A TIMEOUT, SO O'CONNELL -- TAKE A LOOK AT HIS STORY FROM OMAHA, NEBRASKA. HE WAS A WALK AT PURDUE, STARTED 32 GAMES OVER SIX SEASONS. GREW UP IN CHICAGO, SEVENTH CAREER START TONIGHT. IN AND OUT OF THE STARTING LINEUP. FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON AND BE THE GUY ALL THE WAY TO THE END. KIRK: HE WAS LOOKING TENTATIVE LAST WEEK, UNSURE. TONIGHT HE HAS A GUNSLINGER MENTALITY. HE'S GOT THE RIGHT MINDSET FOR A YOUNG QUARTERBACK TO DEAL WITH ADVERSITY SAYS A LOT ABOUT HIM. AL: THIRD AND 10 DEEP IN THE POCKET, CAUGHT AND SHORT OF THE FOURTH AND TO AND THEY SEND IN THE PUNT GROUP. KIRK: WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT TO THE RAIDERS HAVE TO DO AND I SAID MAXX CROSBY AND COMPANY HAVE TO HAVE THEIR OWN OFFENSE AND NOW YOU ARE SEEING THEM HAVING TO WORK FROM DEEP IN THEIR OWN TERRITORY. CHARGERS SHOULD HAVE DECENT FIELD POSITION. AL: AJAY'S NET AVERAGE IS THE BEST IN THE LEAGUE AT WEEK 15. THROWING HAND. HE BROKE THE BONE OF HIS INDEX FINGER, THE MOST IMPORTANT FINGER FOR A QUARTERBACK. HE HAD PINS INSERTED TO STABILIZE IT. BRANDON DALEY SAID THERE IS NO WILL TAKE SIX WEEKS. AL: THEY NEED HIM, THE FRANCHISE QUARTERBACK AT THE END OF HIS ROOKIE CONTRACT. FOR 20 MINUTES HE WAS THE HIGHEST-PAID GUY IN THE LEAGUE. HE IS DONE FOR THE SEASON. ISAIAH SPILLER IS THE RUNNING BACK, FIRST TIME YOU'VE SEEN THERE IS A FLAG. >> INFRACTION DEFENSE, FIVE YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN. AL: HERBERT CAME ON AS A ROOKIE IN 2020. TAYLOR WAS GOING TO BE THE HE DID NOT MISS ANY GAMES. FRACTURED HIS FINGER ON HIS NON-THROWING HAND. FIRST AND FIVE, THAT IS ISAIAH SPILLER OUT OF TEXAS A AND M. KIRK: YOU BUILD YOUR FRANCHISE AROUND HIM AND YOU SEE SOME MOVES THAT THE FRANCHISE MAKES, WHAT THEY DO TO TRY TO HELP HIM. THE PLAYERS AROUND HIM, YOU'VE GOT DECISIONS TO MAKE. HERBERT IS A GREAT PLAYER BUT THE OFFENSE HAS STRUGGLED. THEY CANNOT RUN THE BALL. ECKLER HURT HIS ANKLE, THE GENERAL MANAGER IS LOOKING ON. THEY ARE 0-13 ON THIRD DOWN. AL: CAN HE GET THE FIRST DOWN? YES HE CAN. KIRK: THE LAST THING I WILL SAY, HE IS 30-32 AS A STARTING QUARTERBACK SO THE CHARGERS HAVE NOT CAPITALIZED IN THE FIRST FIVE-YEAR YEAR WINDOW WITH HIM AND THEY'VE GOT TO MAKE DECISIONS AROUND HIM TO GET BETTER UP FRONT AND BETTER SKILLS WISE TO BUILD FOR THE FUTURE. THE MIDDLE PART OF HIS CAREER AND BEYOND. AL: THE CHARGERS HAVE A LOT OF DECISIONS WHEN THE SEASON ENDS. A TIMEOUT IS CALLED HERE. THE NARRATIVE HAS BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE BOUGHT THIS TEAM HAD A CHANCE TO GO TO THE SUPER BOWL THIS YEAR. THEY LOST THEIR FIRST TWO GAMES, WHEN THE NEXT TWO, THEN LOSE, THEN WHEN SO THEY ARE 4-4 AT THE HALFWAY MARK OF THE SEASON. KIRK: FIVE LOSSES, THINK HOW DIFFERENT THE SEASON COULD BE, FIVE LOSSES WITH THREE POINTS OR LESS. THEY'VE GOT TO WONDER HOW DO WE KEEP LOSING GAMES? THEY ARE PLAYING WELL ENOUGH TO WIN BUT IN THE FOURTH THE BALL BOUNCES THE WRONG WAY AND THEY FIND THEMSELVES 5-8. WINS. AL: THEY'VE LOST MORE GUT WRENCHING GAMES AND ANY TEAM OVER THE PAST TWO AND A HALF DECADES. A WHOLE LITANY. DECADES, EXACTLY RIGHT AND I MEANT THAT. FROM THE 33. CUTTING TO THE OUTSIDE. ISAIAH SPILLER. TO LOSE IN HEARTBREAKING FASHION WOULD BE THE DEFINITION OF THAT IN WEBSTER'S. 31 GAMES DECIDED BY EIGHT OR FEWER POINTS IN THE RECORD WAS 15-16. SINCE 2020 16 GAMES DECIDED BY THREE POINTS OR LESS AND WE COULD GO ON BUT WE WON'T. SECOND DOWN AND SEVEN. SMITH FIRES, INCOMPLETE. ALEX ERICKSON, FIRST TIME THEY'VE LOOKED HIS WAY TONIGHT. HOBBS IS COVERING. KIRK: HOBBS WHEN HE IS HEALTHY IS ONE OF THE MORE TALENTED SPOT CORNERS. HE IS PHYSICAL, TOUGH. YOU CAN COVER HIM THE WAY YOU JUST SAW. THE TOTAL PACKAGE RAIDERS DEFENSE. AL: GREAT JOB OUT OF THE SLOT, THIRD DOWN AND SEVEN. STICK, LOOK OUT. UNDER PRESSURE, OUT OF THE WAY. THEY ALREADY HAVE A SACK TONIGHT, P ON FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: THEY'RE GOING UP AGAINST LATER ON LEFT TACKLE WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE ONE OF THE BETTER IN PASS PROTECTION. HERE COMES CROSBY AROUND BUT IT IS ONE-ON-ONE BECAUSE YOU TRUST SLATER TO WIN. YOU'VE GOT TO WIN THE MATCHUP AND YOU LOSE ON THIRD DOWN. AL: JK SCOTT, HIS THIRD PUNT OF THE NIGHT. CARTER BACK, TAKES IT ON THE RUN AT THE 17 YARDO. FAMILIAR SHOT IN LAS VEGAS. KIRK: WE HAD AN ELVIS IMPERSONATOR THIS MORNING. HOW MANY ARE THERE IN VEGAS? AL: 6412. FROM THE 30 YARD LINE ON FIRST DOWN, O'CONNELL FIRES, INCOMPLETE AT THE 40 YARD LINE. ADAMS COVERED BY SAMUELS IN A ONE-ON-ONE MATCHUP. KIRK: IN MAN COVERAGE HE HAS OUTSIDE LEVERAGE. HE KEEPS GETTING BETTER. YOU SEE THE PATIENTS BY DAVANTE ADAMS ON THAT ROUTE, A GOOD JOB BY SAMUEL WORKING AROUND HIS BODY AND USING THEIR RIGHT HAND TO KNOCK THE BALL AWAY. HECK OF A MATCHUP WITH ADAMS, EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT HIM. AL: BIG-TIME TIME PLAYER, SECOND DOWN AND 10. AT THE FIVE IS WHITE, THIRD DOWN. TO THIS POINT, 154 TOTAL YARDS FOR VEGAS, 61 FOR THE CHARGERS. KIRK: THEY TOLD US THEY WANTED TO GET BACK ON THE FIELD BUT THEY HAVE NOT LOOKED THIS GOOD IN A LONG TIME. FIRST TWO GAMES THEY GOT WINS, EVERYONE'S EXCITED, THEN THEY LOSE A FEW. THEY HAVE NOT EXECUTED LIKE THIS AL: THIRD AND FIVE. SEND AN EXTRA MAN, THE PASS IS NOT DOWN. CHARGERS DEFENSE RESPONDING WITH ANTONIO PIERCE, INTERIM COACH. HE WAS THE LINEBACKER COACH. HOW OFTEN DOES THE LINEBACKER COACH GET THAT JOB? KIRK: TIME WILL TELL BUT I WAS TALKING TO JOSH JACOBS BEFORE THE GAME AND A LOT OF OWNERS HAVE BIG DECISIONS BUT JOSH SAID WE LOVE THAT HE'S BEEN THERE AS A PLAYER AND WE RESPECT HIM AS A COACH. AL: THAT BALL IS OUT AND AGAIN A TURNOVER! AJAY TURNER COMES ALONG WITH IT. >> FUMBLE BY THE RECEIVING TEAM. KIRK: AJ RIPPED IT AWAY FROM IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE SAW IT COMING AND THERE'S NO WAY IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN WITH ANOTHER TURNOVER BUT SURE ENOUGH HE RIPPED THE BALL AND RECOVERS NOW THEY GIVE O' NOW THEY GIVE O'CONNELL THE BALL. EVERYTHING GOING RIGHT FOR THE RAIDERS, A DISASTER FOR THE AL: COMPLETE NIGHTMARE FOR THE O'CONNELL AT 50%, 23 YARDS, TWO TOUCHDOWNS OVER THE LEFT SIDE. A COUPLE FOR ZAMEER WHITE, SECOND AND EIGHT. KIRK: THE RED ZONE HAS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT THE RAIDERS STRUGGLED WITH. AL: KENNETH MURRAY IS INJURED SO A TIMEOUT WHILE THEY TEND TO HIM WITH NINE AND A HALF TO GO IN THE THE CHARGERS HAVE GIVEN IT AWAY THREE TIMES TONIGHT, THE FIRST ONE RIGHT HERE. SACK, FUMBLED, RECOVERED. KELLY, FUMBLE RECOVERED BY LAS VEGAS. THEN MOMENTS AGO ON THE PUNT RETURN. MURRAY WALKED OFF UNDER HIS OWN POWER. KIRK: PLUS 32, PLUS 31 AND NOW THEY ARE IN PLUS 13. AL: SECOND AND SEVEN. PLAY ACTION, WIDE OPEN THE NOTRE DAME ROOKIE, A QUICK NIGHT FOR HIM. 11 YARDS FOR A TOUCHDOWN. KIRK: GOOD JOB BY THE PLAY CALLER GETTING A BETTER VIEW. THE TIGHT END IS RIGHT HERE, WATCH HIM SELL THIS TO THE POINT THAT HUMAN KEEPS HIS EYES OFF OF EASY TOUCHDOWN WITH A GOOD PLAY CALL. AL: FOR THE SECOND WEEK IN A ROW WE DID NOT THINK WE WOULD SEE THAT MANY POINTS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE 28 ON THE BOARD. NINE MINUTES 15 AL: AIDAN O'CONNELL GETTING STARTED AFTER GETTING SHUT OUT LAST WEEK. MICHAEL MAYER HAS BEEN ON THE MARK. 9-17. BEAUTIFUL RIGHT THERE OUT OF THE POCKET. IF YOU ARE THE CHARGERS YOU DRAW INSPIRATION FROM THE FACT THAT THEY HAD A 27-LEAD AND THEN BLEW TEAMS COME FROM BEHIND. KIRK: IT'S NOT WHAT COMES TO MIND WHEN I LOOK AT CHARGERS OF GOT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU BUT I LOVE THE IDEA, THE CONCEPT. AL: WHATEVER IT TAKES, I'M TELLING YOU. AT THIS POINT. FROM THE THREE, DAVIS. TAKING IT TO THE 25 YARD LINE. GET TO SEE THE OTHER L.A. TEAM NEXT WEEK ON THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL WHEN THE RAMS WILL BE HOSTING THE SAINTS AND DEREK CARR IN HIS FIRST YEAR KICKOFF STARTS AT 7:00. SAINTS AND RAMS NEXT THURSDAY. KIRK: WE TALKED ABOUT HERBERT AND STICK MAKING THEIR CAREER STARTS. THIS KID IS TRYING TO DO THIS WITHOUT HIS GO TO TARGET, KEENAN ALLEN. A LOT OF RECEIVERS TRY TO FIND OUT WHO WILL BE THE GUY WHO WILL STAND OUT. HE HAS NOT GOTTEN A TOUCH YET. AL: TRICKERY DOES NOT WORK EITHER. DAVIS AT THE INSIDE WITH A FLIP. CROSBY IS QUITE A STORY OBVIOUSLY. HUGE ISSUES, HE HAS PLAYED 97% OF SNAP SWITCHES UNHEARD OF FOR A DEFENSIVE LINEMAN. KIRK: I LOVE WATCHING HIM PLAY. ANYONE WHO LOVES FOOTBALL WATCHES HIS ENTHUSIASM. THIS GUY DOES EVERYTHING. HE IS TRYING TO GAIN AN EDGE. AL: STICKING WITH CHASE. WE'VE GOT A FLAG. >> HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER 79. AL: RIGHT TACKLE. MAD MAX, 51 SACKS SINCE 2019. PLAYED OVER 4300 SNAPS, 300 MORE THAN ANY DEFENSIVE LINEMAN. 97%. IF YOU FOLLOW THE RAIDERS YOU KNOW WHEN HE WAS BORN HE WAS 11 POUNDS NINE AND SAID -- OUNCES, SO THEY NEEDED ANOTHER X FOR EXTRA-LARGE. KIRK: HE WATCHED ALL 10 EPISODES. AL: THE PASS IS CAUGHT AND GANG TACKLED. JOHNSTON MAKES HIS FIRST CATCH AND WE GO TO KAYLEE. KAYLEE: TWO ANYONE SUGGESTED CROSBY SHUT HIS SEASON DOWN HE SAYS YOU DO NOT KNOW ME. FOR FIVE YEARS HE HAS NEVER MISSED A GAME AND NO MATTER THE RECORD HE WILL KEEP DOING HIS THING. HERE IS A HOSPITALIZED ON THANKSGIVING WITH AN INFECTION. THE PAIN WAS UNBEARABLE BUT HE WAS PLAYING THREE DAYS LATER. AL: HE CAN'T BE STOPPED. THIRD DOWN AND FIVE, PICKED UP 17 ON THE LAST PLAY, GAVE UP 22. ROLLING AND THROWING, IT IS FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: THIS OFFENSIVE LINE DOUBLES HIM, THEY GET PRESSURE FROM THE OTHER SIDE WHICH GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT HE FACES. THAT IMAGE KAYLEE SHOWED OF THE NEED AND HOW IT WAS SWOLLEN, THEN HE ENDS UP NOT MISSING ONE GAME, THAT TELLS YOU A LOT ABOUT HIS APPROACH. HE SAID IT CAME DOWN TO IT CAME TIME DECISION AND HE SAID YOU'RE NOT KEEPING OUT OF THIS GAME. AL: NOTHING STOPS HIM. LINE DRIVE KICK TO DEANDRE CARTER WHO MAKES IT BACK TO THE 36 YARD LINE WITH SEVEN MINUTES 21 SECONDS INFROM THE 35 YARD LI NIGHT FOR THE HOME CROWD. FLANKED ON SUNDAY AND 28 POINTS A THREE YARD PICKUP HERE. TALKING ABOUT ANTONIO PIERCE WHO TAKES OVER AND WINS. HE WAS A LINEBACKER WITH THE GIANTS, HAD GREAT GAMES IN THE 2007 SUPER BOWL, GREW UP IN COMPTON CALIFORNIA. HE SAID I WAS BORN TO BE A GREATER AND THAT WILL BE DETERMINED AFTER THIS SEASON. KIRK: THE WAY IT STARTED THERE WAS A TON OF MOMENTUM. THEY LOST GAMES. YOU WILL HAVE A FEW MORE GAMES AHEAD OF THEM. ALL YOU CAN DO IS COMPETE. IT'S AN AUDITION FOR HIM AND FOR A LOT OF THESE PLAYERS. I LIKE THAT THE SKY HAS COACHING EXPERIENCE. HE'S BEEN AROUND A LOT OF TOP ATHLETES, BROUGHT THEM AROUND THE TEAM, USED THE WISDOM THEY PROVIDE AND SAID WE HAD A TO SEE MARTIN LEWIS ON THE FIELD. HE SAID I RELY ON THESE GUYS, I'VE GOT GOOD STAFF, I WANT TO EMPOWER THEM TO SAY THIS TEAM, LET'S TAKE IT ONE WEEK AT A TIME. THREE-NOTHING LAST WEEK AND LOOK AT HIM. AL: THAT'S CAUGHT, FIRST DOWN AND IT A LOT MORE.DAVANTE ADAMS , DAVIS RUNS HIM DOWN AND ADAMS PICKS UP 24 YARDS T KIRK: PRESSURE FROM THE LEFT CREATES A ONE-ON-ONE ANYTIME YOU GET A ONE-ON-ONE OPPORTUNITY A IS THE MATCHUP THERE LOOKING FOR. THE LINE GIVES HIM TIME, HIS FEET ARE SET AND HE IS AN ACCURATE PASSER AS HE DEMONSTRATES TONIGHT. KIRK: 163 YARDS FOR O'CONNELL AT THIS POINT, THREE CATCHES FOR ADAMS. THEY THROW IT. MYERS, CAUGHT. ADAMS HAS DONE THAT BEFORE. BEFORE HE EVER SCORED A TOUCHDOWN AS A RECEIVER MYERS THROUGH TWO TOUCHDOWN PASSES WITH NEW ENGLAND. SECOND AND ONE. KIRK: YOU CAN TELL IT WILL BE A PASS WHEN HE IS IN MOTION. WATCH TO THE RIGHT AND THE EFFORT, ADAMS IS WAITING ON THE DEFENDER. WAITING TO FEEL WHAT IS SAMUEL DOING. I'LL TAKE THE FIRST DOWN AND SETTLE RIGHT THERE. GOOD THROW BY MILOS -- THEY DID NOT GET THE FIRST DOWN. AL: SECOND AND 1, 4 AND A HALF TO GO. THEY GIVE IT TO TUCKER WHO LOSES ONE. KAYLEE: A CONVERSATION ABOUT ANTONIO PIERCE, JACOBY MYERS SAID PLAYERS WHERE WALKING ON EGGSHELLS UNDER THE PREVIOUS REGIME BECAUSE OF THE EXPECTATIONS BUT THAT WEIGHT WAS LIFTED WHEN PIERCE BECAME HEAD COACH READ ROBERT SAYS HE WANTS PIERCE TO KEEP THE JOB AND HE HAS SEEN HIS GROWTH IN THESE SIX THE PLAYERS. AL: WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT IT HAS BEEN LIKE AND HE SAID A TORNADO AND A HURRICANE. NOW TAKING THE SNAP WILL BE BRANDON BOLDEN, HE WILL KEEP IT. HE WILL RUN ALL THE WAY TO THE END ZONE. BRANDON BOLDEN, WHO HAD NOT CARRIED THE BALL ONE TIME ALL SEASON HAS CARRIED TWICE INTO THE END ZONE. HE GOES 26 YARDS. KIRK: A GUY WHO IS HAVING ON NIGHT IS THE OFFENSES PLAY CALLER, EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE WORKING. NOT GREAT EFFORT ON THAT PLAY ESPECIALLY WITH THE TACKLING. THE CHARGERS LOOKED DEFEATED WITH THREE MINUTES 50 SECONDS TO GO IN THE FIRST HALF. AL: ABSOLUTELY. CARLSON FOR THE POINT AFTER. FOR THE SECOND WEEK IN A ROW WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE THE FIR HALF. KIRK: JACOBY MYERS ON THE EDGE, YOU WILL SEE HIM WITH A CRACKED BLOCK AT THE TOP. LOOK AT THESE LINEMAN FROM DOWNFIELD. JORDAN MEREDITH DOWNFIELD, AND NICE BLOCK ON MACK. GET HIM TO THE EDGE AND A POOR JOB FROM THE CHARGERS NOT GETTING OFF OF BLOCKS. DAVIS, LAME ARM TACKLE. AND BOLDEN WAS RUNNING HARD. THIS OFFENSE IS WITHOUT JOSH JACOBS. YOU'VE SEEN WHITE, ABDULLAH AND BOLDEN GETTING THEIR CHANCES, ALL THREE OF THEM GETTING CHANCES TO PUT YARDS ON THE BOARD. AL: YOU'RE RIGHT. WITHOUT JOSH JACOBS TO LEAD THE LEAGUE IN RUSHING, YOU'VE GOT WHITE, ABDULLAH, BOLDEN, THAT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT. AND KHALIL MACK. THE CHARGERS, WHAT CAN I TELL YOU? THEY JUST LOOKED DEFEATED RIGHT NOW. KIRK: I'M NOT INTO PILING ON A GUY BUT BRANDON WAS ON THE HOT SEAT WHEN THE SEASON STARTED, HE'S TRENDING ON TWITTER BECAUSE OF THE WAY THIS GAME IS GOING. AL: WHAT IS IT TRENDING ON TWITTER? KIRK: LET'S LOOK AT NEXGEN STATS BY AWS. MATCHED UP AGAINST MAXX CROSBY IS A TOUGH ASSIGNMENT. YOU CAN SEE THE PRESSURES, HE'S HAD SOME HELP WITH THE TIGHT ENDS BUT HE'S BEEN ON AN ISLAND SO FAR. KEEPING CROSBY OFF THE YOUNG QUARTERBACK. AL: STICK IS 9-13 BUT SPILLER IS THE RUNNING BACK. ROBERTSON GOT A FLAG. BACK AT THE 20 YARD LINE. KIRK: GOING TO CALL THAT ON ROBINSON. >> TAUNTING, DEFENSE, NUMBER 21. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN, UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT PENALTY. KIRK: STEPS OVER TOP OF HIM, HAS A FEW WORDS. THE OFFICIAL CALLS THE PENALTY AND PATRICK GRAHAM TAKES HIM OFF AL: PROBABLY SAID HAVEN'T WE SUFFERED ENOUGH. KIRK: 35-0, LET'S PLAY SMART. AL: THAT LEAVE US ALONE. FROM THE 40. SPILLER FOR A GAIN OF ONE WITH THREE AND A HALF TO GO IN THE OPENING HALF. KIRK: PIERCE HAS TO BE HAPPY WITH THE WAY PATRICK AND HIS DEFENSE IS PLAYING. THE CHARGERS HAVE SIX POSSESSIONS. PUNT, FUMBLE, FUMBLE, PUNT AND A POINT. AL: TONIGHT IT IS COMPLETELY ON SPILLER A YARDER TO SHY. KIRK: SPILLER WAS AT TEXAS A&M IN COLLEGE. I THINK YOU WILL GET MORE CHANCES TONIGHT OR THE REST OF THEIR SEASON TO FEEL HIM OUT. HAVING A GREAT YEAR, OPENING A LOT OF HOLES. AL: THIRD DOWN AND ONE, NOT GOING TO GET IT. JONES COMES OVER TO MAKE THE TACKLE, FOURTH DOWN, TWO AND A HALF TO GO TO THE HALF. KIRK: HE RAN INTO A WALL, NOWHERE TO GO. ACROSS-THE-BOARD THE OFFENSIVE LINE LOSES. CROSBY IS A GREAT DEFENDER. AL: FOURTH DOWN, THEY GET TO THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING BEFORE THE PLAY CLOCK RUNS OUT AND THEY ARE HAPPY TO DO THAT, TRUST ME. TWO MINUTES TILL THE HALF. AL: IF YOU ARE JUST TUNING IN, NOT A TYPO. ALL RAIDERS ALL NIGHT, FOURTH DOWN AND ONE FOR THE CHARGERS. FROM THEIR OWN 49 YARD LINE. ERICKSON GOES TO THE OUTSIDE ON THE LEFT, KEEP IT ON THE GROUND AND WITH A FLAG DOWN, THAT IS ECKLER SO HE DID NOT GET THERE TO GET THE CALL HERE. KIRK: THE CHARGERS LINED UP OFFSIDES AND WE SAW A CONTROVERSIAL CALL. >> OFFSIDES, OFFENSE, NUMBER SEVEN. PENALTY IS DECLINED, FIRST DOWN LAS VEGAS. AL: I'M TRYING TO THINK OF A SILVER LINING, THIS HAS BEEN THE BIG STORY ALL WEEK AND THERE IT IS CLEARLY, EVERETT LINING UP OFFSIDES, THERE GOES THE FLAG. IF THERE IS A SILVER LINING THE FLIGHT HOME IS ONLY 45 MINUTES. IMAGINE DOING COAST TO COAST AFTER THIS. KIRK: THAT WOULD BE BRUTAL. ME ON THE OTHER HAND -- AL: FLYING FROM VIRGINIA EVERY OTHER WEEKEND BUT YOU ARE OFF THIS WEEK. CONGRATULATIONS. LOOKING FOR MORE, ADAMS WEAVING OUT OF THE 40 YARD LINE, TACKLED BY DAVIS. KIRK: I KEEP BRINGING UP HIS NAME AS A PLAY CALLER BECAUSE HE'S NEVER DONE IT AND NO ONE EXPECTED THIS PERFORMANCE BUT HE CONTINUES TO PERFECTLY. AL: FIRST DOWN, INSIDE THE 35. ZAMIR WHITE. KIRK: I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR THE POINTS THAT IT NOT PUT UP LAST WEEK TONIGHT. THEY ARE IN ATTACK MODE TRYING TO GET TO 42. I DON'T THINK THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT A FIELD GOAL. AL: FILLING SOME MERCY AT THIS POINT AND NOT CALLING A TIMEOUT. FROM THE 34, INCOMPLETE. AND AS FATE WOULD HAVE IT WHO GETS THE BALL START OF THE SECOND HALF? KIRK: THE RAIDERS GET THE BALL. THINK ABOUT THIS, BEING IN THE MINDSET OF THE CHARGERS, THERE 5-8, THEY'VE HAD FIVE GAMES SLIP THROUGH THEIR FINGERS. THEY SHOW UP IN A BIG DIVISIONAL MATCHUP ON THURSDAY NIGHT ON NATIONAL TV AND YOU HAVE THREE TURNOVERS IN YOUR OWN TERRITORY, FOR YOUR DEFENSE IN A TOUGH SPOT YOUR DOWN 35. YOU HAVE TO GO PLAY SOME DEFENSE. AL: A GIGANTIC HEADACHE. ABDULLAH TRIED TO GET THE FIRST DOWN, KEPT ON GOING. GETTING UNTANGLED HERE. KIRK: I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE MARK OF A TEAM THAT IS GOING TO SHUT THINGS DOWN, IT SHOWS UP IN THEIR TACKLING AND HERE IS A TACKLE BY JAMES. LOOK AT THE EFFORT BY THE RAIDERS TO KEEP COMING, ANO THREE OR FOUR YARDS TO GET THE AL: THERE IS THE GANG. YOU GUYS ALREADY? KIRK: YOU'VE GOT THE SECOND HALF, BOYS. THE WHOLE SECOND HALF. COMING UP. KIRK: WERE GOING TO ROTATE AND THEY CAN COME UP HERE EVERY THIRD SERIES. AL: WE WILL GIVE YOU CAVIAR TO DINE OUT ON EVERY WEEK. IT IS SECOND DOWN. AS IT TURNS OUT IT IS SECOND AND >> CORRECTION, THIRD DOWN. AL: MAKE IT THIRD AND DOWN AS HE MAKES THAT CORRECTION. THE VISUALS SAY IT ALL EVERY TIME. TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE. UP THE MIDDLE, THAT IS A FIRST DOWN, ABDULLAH TO THE 19 YARD LINE AND THE RAIDERS ARE GOING TO FOR THE MOMENT TAKE A TIMEOUT BUT HE IS SAYING BASSI IS THE INJURED CHARGER, SO IT IS AN INJURY TIMEOUT. OF ALL THINGS. KIRK: HATE TO SEE IT ANYTIME A DEFENDER LOWERS HIS HEAD, THAT IS THE BIG FEAR OF POTENTIAL INJURY TO THE. AL: KAYLEE, DOWN TO YOU. KAYLEE: MURRAY HAS BEEN BACK ON THE FIELD. HE WAS IN THE TENT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES WITH THE NEUROTRAUMA CONSULTANT AND STAFF. HE HAS BEEN ON THE INJURY REPORT FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS. THEY TAPED HIM UP AND HE IS BACK OUT THERE. AL: LOOK AT HIM ALONGSIDE MAC. MURRAY LEADING THE TEAM IN TACKLES, MEANWHILE THE GOOD NEWS IS BASSI IS ABLE TO WALK OFF THE FIELD UNDER HIS OWN POWER. AND WITH 36 SECONDS, THE RAIDERS ARE LOOKING FOR MORE. WHAT SONG ARE YOU GOING TO SING IN THE SECOND HALF FOR US? KIRK: WE'VE GOT TO BRING ELVIS UP HERE. AL: FIRST DOWN FROM THE 20 YARD O'CONNELL, END ZONE, TOUCHDOWN, TREY TUCKER, HIS SECOND OF THE KIRK: WITH THE MOTION OF CARTER, THE DEFENDER RUNNING WITH HIM, O'CONNELL KNEW RIGHT AWAY HE HAD WHAT HE WANTED WITH MAN TO MAN COVERAGE. HIS FASTEST RECEIVER IN TUCKER AND LOOK AT THE CELEBRATION. ALL OFFENSIVE LINE DOES THEIR JOB, GIVING HIM ENOUGH TIME TO GET TO THE TOP OF THE ROUTE, PULLING AWAY FROM DAVIS AND HERE IS MACK ONE-ON-ONE, NOT ENOUGH TIME BUT COMFREY DOES A NICE JOB. AL: HOLDS HIM IN CHECK. AL: THEY WOULD STOP THE GAME, RIGHT? WE ARE IN VEGAS, THOUGH REFEREE STOPS THE CONTEST. KIRK: RAIDERS TEAM HISTORY. AL: TRYING TO SEE THE LAST TIME ANY TEAM LED BY 42 POINTS IN THE FIRST HALF. 2014, THE PACKERS AGAINST THE BEARS I'M TOLD WAS THE LAST TIME IT WAS 42-0. WE ARE NOT DONE YET. KIRK: TOUGH, MAN. WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THESE TURNOVERS AND WE ARE EXCITED TO SEE EASTON STICK GET HIS CHANCE TO MAKE HIS FIRST CAREER START IN FOR JUSTIN HERBERT. FROM THE FIRST SERIES ON, THIS KID HAS NOT NO WEIGHT CHARGERS WITH THREE TURNOVERS IN 21 POINTS. AL: MIGHT AS WELL JUST SHUT IT DOWN HERE. ISAIAH SPILLER GAINS A COUPLE. HERE COME THE CHARGERS. THE RAIDERS WILL DO ALL OF THE CELEBRATING AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE GOING. END OF THE FIRST HALF. RAIDERS STARTED HOT, HAS BEEN HOT. LET'S GO TO KAYLEE. HALF? >> THAT WAS NOT US OUT THERE. WE DID NOT COME READY TO PLAY. SECOND HALF WE GOT TO PLAY IT FOR PRIDE. WE'VE GOT TO REGROUP AND PLAY A BETTER SECOND HALF. >> WE TRAIN ALL YEAR ROUND. >> OH BOY. NIGHTMARE BEGINNING FOR THE >> THE EXECUTING. >> TO THE END ZONE. TREY TUCKER. ALL IN FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. JACOBY MYERS. CASHING IN ON ANOTHER TURNOVER. >> EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE >> WHO ARE THESE GUYS? AL: HALFTIME 42-0. KAYLEE: SUNDAY, YOU WERE SHUT FOUR DAYS LATER, 42 POINTS ON THE BOARD AFTER THE FIRST HALF. WHAT IGNITED THE OFFENSE? >> THAT'S WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING FOR ALL SEASON. KAYLEE: WHAT DID YOU TELL YOUR TEAM ABOUT HOW THEY APPROACH THE >> PRESS THE GAS PEDAL EVEN HARDER. AL: SO IT'S 42-0. THE RAIDERS ARE GOING TO GET THE BALL TO START. 283 YARDS FOR VEGAS IN THE FIRST ONLY 89 FOR L.A. SECOND HALF STARTS WITH THE TOUCHBACK. NOW IT'S TIME FOR TONIGHT'S JOURNEY, PRESENTED BY HYUNDAI. 42 POINT LEAD, LARGEST RAIDERS HALFTIME LEAD. SECOND LARGEST IN NFL HISTORY. NO SACKS TONIGHT FOR THE CHARGERS WHO HAD SEVEN AGAINST O'CONNELL IN THE FIRST GAME OF WEEK FOUR. 14 PASSES IN THE FIRST HALF, MOST BY ANY PLAYER THIS SEASON. HE STARTS HERE WITH A HANDOFF. ABOUT A TWO YARD GAIN THAT TURNS INTO A FIVE YARD GAIN. KIRK: THE THING THAT STOOD OUT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF WITHIN THE PLAY OF THE OFFENSIVE LINE, I THINK JOSH JACOBS IS DOWN TONIGHT. ANDRE JAMES IS THE COLTON MILLER IS THE LEFT TACKLE. THEY RESHUFFLED THINGS UP FRONT. KHALIL MACK AND THE CHARGERS YOU ARE WORRIED, ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO RUN THE BALL? MAX COMING AFTER HIM AGAIN. COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY. AL: SECOND AND 6 -- 6. PLAY ACTION. UP TO THE 47 YARD LINE. THE HEADLINE STORY IN THE SPORTS SECTION OF THE JOURNAL OF VEGAS TODAY WAS, WHO WILL BE THE QUARTERBACK IN TONIGHT'S GAME? PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GARROTTE BELOW. KIRK: WHEN YOU COME OFF A GAME WHERE YOU GET SHUT OUT, THEY'VE LOST THREE IN A ROW. THE OFFENSE HAS BEEN REELING. IT'S ONLY NATURAL TO ASSUME, ARE THEY GOING TO GO BACK TO HIM? GIVE THE OFFENSIVE STAFF A LOT OF CREDIT. A LOT OF NEW PLAYERS BEING ASKED TO DO FROM THINGS. GIVE THEM CREDIT. THEY PUT TOGETHER A GOOD PLAN. THEY EXECUTED. AL: PERFECT SO FAR. ALL THE WAY TO THE 38 YARD LINE GOES ZAMIR WHITE. KIRK: THE OFFENSIVE LINE CONTINUING TO DO A GOOD JOB. WHITE WHO I AM FAMILIAR WITH BECAUSE OF HIS DAYS AT GEO PULLS AROUND. NICE BLOCK. YOU ALSO HAVE TO ADD THAT THE CHARGERS ARE JUST NOT GETTING OFF OF BLOCKS. THAT STARTED TO BECOME SOMETHING WE SAW FROM ABOUT THE EARLY PART OF THE SECOND QUARTER ON. CLEARLY CONTINUING HERE INTO THE SECOND HALF. AL: PLAY-ACTION. MOVING TO HIS LEFT, BUYING TIME. PASS INCOMPLETE. COVERED THAT KIRK: HE WAS SACKED SEVEN TIMES. SIX TIMES ALONE BY KHALIL MACK. FIRST TIME THEY MATCHED UP. THIS TIME, MAC ENDS UP GOING INSIDE INSTEAD OF OUTSIDE. THAT ALLOWED HIM TO HAVE THE HALF ROLLAWAY. GOOD JOB NOT ONLY BY JOHNSON ALSO GETTING INVOLVED. THE WHOLE KEY IS TO KEEP 52 OUT, IT'S WORKED. HE IS HAD ALL KINDS OF TIME. AL: GREAT TIME OF THAT TONIGHT ON EVERY LEVEL. DROPPED BY AUSTIN HOOPER. KIRK: AFTER THOSE SIX SACKS IN THE FIRST MATCH UP, YOU THOUGHT, MUNFORD HASN'T PLAYED A TON. HE'S MOVED AROUND FROM THE RIGHT SIDE TO THE LEFT SIDE. MUNFORD HAS DONE A HECKUVA JOB OUT OF OHIO STATE. HASN'T HAD A LOT OF HELP. I THINK THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF HAVE HIM THROWING THE BALL IN SUM LEE DOWNS. REALLY SMART. IT' IT'S BEEN A NICE PLAN. AIDAN O'CONNELL LOOKS LIKE HE'S VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE ATTACK AL: THIRD AND 10. 33 YARD LINE. THE FLAG COMING IN AT THE END OF THE PLAY. A LITTLE DRAWING GOING ON WITH DAVIS AND ABDULLAH. KIRK: HE CAME FACEMASK. THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE. JUSTIN HOLLINS. AL: THAT'S THE DISCUSSION RIGHT YOU CAN SEE THE MOTION BY THE OFFICIALS. TORPOR DISCUSSING IT. >> PERSONAL FOUL. NUMBER 56. PENALTY, 15 YARDS. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. RECALL. RECALL ON A. -- EIGHT. CORRECTION, IT'S NUMBER 58. AL: THERE YOU GO. YEAH. THAT MOVES THE BALL TO THE 18 SO WITH THAT -- WITHOUT JACOBS TONIGHT, THE RAIDERS HAVE RUSHED FOR 100 YARDS. A LITTLE FAKE TO THE RIGHT SIDE. IT GOES TO MYERS. THAT WILL SET UP A FIRST DOWN AND GOAL AT THE SEVEN YARD LINE. KIRK: THIS IS THE WORST RUSHING OFFENSE IN THE NFL. THEY ARE AT OVER 100 YARDS RUNNING A BALL AGAINST THE CHARGERS DEFENSE. WHEN YOU RUN THE FOOTBALL, IT ALLOWS O'CONNELL TO HAVE THE PLAY-ACTION OPPORTUNITIES AND CONTINUE TO TRY TO MIX IT UP INTO DO A GOOD JOB ON FIRST AND 10 AND TRY TO GET THE BALL OUT. AL: THE WORST RUSHING SITUATION. AND WITHOUT JACOBS. FIRST AND GOAL. O'CONNELL, CAUGHT. THAT WILL TAKE IT TO ZAMIR WHITE MAKES THE CATCH. SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. KIRK: ANTONIO PIERCE, IN HIS MIND IT IS 00. HE'S LOOKING AT THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOWCASE WHAT HE CAN DO AS A HEAD COACH, KEEP HIS TEAM GOING, STAYING AGGRESSIVE. REALLY TESTING AS A PRO. YOU FIND OUT WHAT YOU ARE OUT OF. IT'S A TOUGH SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE CHARGERS TO CONTINUE TO GO OUT THERE LIKE AL: SECOND AND GOAL. MYERS IS GOING TO THROW. DAVANTE ADAMS HAULS IT IN. JACOBY MYERS, NO STRANGER TO THROWING THE BALL. HIGH SCHOOL QUARTERBACK. DID IT VERY OFTEN AND WITH GREAT SUCCESS IN NEW ENGLAND. TOUCHDOWN NUMBER SEVEN F KIRK: HE WENT ON THAT MOTION EARLIER WHEN HE CAME FROM THE LEFT. THIS TIME HE COMES FROM THE RIGHT. I LOVE TO WATCH THE JOB DAVANTE ADAMS DID IN SELLING YOU ARE RIGHT. HE LOOKED SO COMFORTABLE. HIS BACKGROUND OF BEING A DOESN'T PANIC, DOESN'T HURRY. BAITED THE DEFENDER. MADE HIM COME TO HIM. FELT THREATENED AND PULLED THE DEFENDER TO HIM. ADAMS IS ALL OVER IT. UP 42. AL: I KNOW. I KNOW. RAIDERS, WHAT CAN I TELL YOU.RAI CHARGERS GET THE BALL. KAYLEE: WE WERE SURPRISED WHEN WE SHOWED UP TO RAIDERS PRACTICE AND DAVANTE ADAMS WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. HE COULDN'T GET OUT OF BED YET -- UNTIL AFTER 6:00 P.M. HE SAID HIS TWO DAUGHTERS WHO WERE BOTH UNDER FOUR JUST GOT OVER HAVING THE FLU AND IT HIT HIM NEXT. HE SAID IT TOOK IVS, VITAMINS, HYDRATION, ALL OF IT TO GET HIM BACK ON THE FIELD TONIGHT. YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW BY THE WAY HE'S BEEN PLAYING TONIGHT. AL: SEVEN CATCHES AND 94 YARDS. MEANWHILE, GETTING FREE IS JOSHUA PALMER. FINALLY SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENS TO THE CHARGERS. JOSH PALMER, 79 YARDS. AFTER MISSING FIVE GAMES AND HANGING HIS HEAD IS ROBERTSON. KIRK: WELL, ROBERTSON SHAKING HIS HEAD. IT DOES LOOK LIKE HE AND HIS SAFETY ARE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE. HERE'S THE CORNER RIGHT HERE. YOU SEE FIVE MOTIONING OUT. I THINK THAT CREATES CONFUSION, BY MOTIONING HIM TO THE OUTSIDE. STEVE ROBERTSON LOOKING INTO THE INSIDE, WONDERING WHERE THE SAFETY SUPPORT MIGHT BE. FOR THE FIRST TIME ALL NIGHT, THE CHARGERS ARE ABLE TO MAKE A BIG PLAY OFFENSIVELY. AL: SECOND TOUCHDOWN PASS. MEANWHILE, THE EXTRA POINT IS JUST BARELY GOOD. OFF THE FOOT OF CAMERON DICKER. 49-7. THE RAIDERS, WHAT HAS IT BEEN LIKE SINCE 2003? THEY WENT TO THE SUPER BOWL AFTER THE LOSS TO TAMPA BAY. THE DREW BS AT THE END. THEY CHANGED COACHES IN MIDSEASON FOUR TIMES. 23 STARTING QUARTERBACKS OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES. TIED FOR FOURTH MOST IN THE LEAGUE. THERE'S THE INTERNAL FLAME OF SORTS. KIRK: DEREK CARR WAS HERE NINE I HAD FORGOTTEN, YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO RICH GANNON WHEN IT COMES TO QUARTERBACK PLAY WHEN THE RAIDERS HAD SUCCESS. THAT'S 20 YEARS AGO. AL: AND IT WAS THE M.V.P. OF THE REGULAR SEASON THAT YEAR. GOES TO THE PLAYOFFS, GETS TO THE SUPER BOWL. PLAYED IN SAN DIEGO. THAT'S THE YEAR THAT JOHN GRUDEN WAS TRADED TO TAMPA BAY. BILL CALLAHAN TAKES OVER. CALLAHAN GETS THE T SUPER BOWL. WHAT HAPPENS? THEY FACE TAMPA BAY AND THEY LIVE THE PARTY TROPHY. MEANWHILE, IN TERMS OF THE DRAFT AS WELL, IT'S BEEN TOUGH. SINCE 16, YOU HAD JOE FOR -- JOSEPH AND CONNOLLY OUT OF THE RUGS AND OUR NET OUT OF THE NFL. WILSON IS A ROOKIE SO NOT A LOT OF SUCCESS WHEN IT COMES TO FIRST ROUND PICKS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL SEASONS. KIRK: NO. IT'S BEEN A DISASTER. A LOT OF THESE GUYS, IT'S NOT THAT THEY ARE ON DIFFERENT TEAMS. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT NOT MID-ROUND OR LATE ROUND PICKS. GOING BACK SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AGO. AL: FROM THE 25. PICKING UP ABOUT FOUR YARDS. KIRK: I THINK IT'S BECAUSE WHEN I SEE THAT RAIDERS UNIFORM, I STILL THINK ABOUT JOHN MADDEN AND SOME OF THE GREAT TEAMS WITH MARCUS ALLEN. WHEN I LOOKED AND SAW THAT THEY'VE BEEN INTO PLAYOFF GAMES SINCE THAT SUPER BOWL, THINK OF SOME OF THOSE GREAT TEAMS. IT'S REMARKABLE TO THINK THAT THAT IS ALL THEY'VE HAD. APPEARANCES. AL: FRED BILETNIKOFF. NICE CHAT WITH THE GREAT WIDE RECEIVER BEFORE THE GAME SECOND DOWN AND 6 SAKE! -- YEAR -- HERE. DARRELL AND MONICA. KIRK: I THINK OF WESTERN HAYES. THAT WAS GREAT. AT THAT TIME, IN THAT ERA. AL: HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT TOOK LESTER HAYES TO CLEAN UP AFTER A GAME? IT WAS AN TO WASH OFF. THIRD DOWN AND 4. THIS IS THE FRANCHISE THAT STARTED THE NFL IN 1960, MOVED TO L.A., BACK TO OAKLAND, AND NOW HERE. THIRD AND 4. STEPPING UP. TAKEN DOWN FINALLY IN THE BACKFIELD IS ERIC KENDRICKS. ABLE TO KNOCK HIM DOWN AS HE TRIED TO ESCAPE. IT'S FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: THIS IS SET UP BY KENT MURRAY. WATCH WHAT HE DOES. ALMOST LIKE SETTING A PICK ON THIS PASS PROTECTION. IT ALLOWS KENDRICKS TO COME OFF OF HIS GUY AND EVENTUALLY GET THAT'S PARTNERS WORKING TOGETHER, BRINGING LINEBACKERS, OCCUPYING THE LEFT GUARD, AND GETTING THE SACK. AL: LINE DRIVE KICK. BOUNCING. PICKED UP INSIDE THE 10 YARD SMOTHERED. 8:13 REMAINING IN THE THIRD. I'M TERRIBLE BUT I LIKE TO AL: YOU DON'T HIT ON LIKE 19. KIRK: NO NO. I KNOW WHEN TO GET UP AND GO TO BED. I'M GOOD AT THAT. AL: AS SOON AS WE GET THE HOTEL. FROM THE 10 YARD LINE. NO PLACE TO REALLY GO. SECOND DOWN. KIRK: DAVIS HAD A RUT -- ROUGH THE ROOKIE HAD THE FUMBLE DEEP IN HIS OWN TERRITORY. THIS TIME, HE PUTS THEM IN A TOUGH SPOT HERE. AL: THE LAST PUNT BY COAL. LEADS THE LEAGUE. 65 YARDS. 83 YARD SECOND DOWN AND 6. THIRD DOWN AND 5. KIRK: LET'S LOCK IN ON 98 HERE. THEY WILL MOVE HIM AROUND. A LOT OF TIMES, HE IS SET UP TO THE RIGHT, COMING OFF THE EDGE. LET'S SEE IF THE CHARGERS WILL DOUBLE-TEAM HIM OR LEAVE HIM ON AN ISLAND. AL: HALFWAY MARK OF THE THIRD. THE THROW IS CAUGHT BUT SHORT. CANNOT GET FREE. TACKLED BY JACK JONES. KIRK: WATCH THIS MOVE TO THE INSIDE AND THEN THE SPIN MOVE OFF OF THAT. IT'S JUST UNFAIR. DIPS INSIDE, GETS THE BIG TACKLE , 320 POUNDS INSIDE, OFF BALANCE. THEN SPINS OUT OF THAT. HE FORCES THE BALL OUT QUICK. JUST AS USEFUL. THAT GUY IS GREAT. AL: SCOTT WITH HIS FIFTH PUNT OF HI, BOOMING KICK. FAIR CATCH. 6:30 TO GO IN THE THIRD. 60 YARDS. 49ERS AND RAVENS CONTROL HALF OF THE TOP CONFERENCE. THOSE TWO TEAMS WILL MEET ON CHRISTMAS DAY. KIRK: RAVENS HAVE MIAMI AND SAN FRANCISCO. AL: EAGLES CONTROLLING THE PATH TO THE DIVISION TITLE. ONLY TWO OF 32 TEAMS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED FROM CONTENTION. PATRIOTS AND PANTHERS. THESE TWO TEAMS STILL MATHEMATICALLY ALIVE. 30 TEAMS STILL MATHEMATICALLY ALIVE. THE PLAYOFF PICTURE AS IT LOOKS RIGHT NOW IN THE AMERICAN BALTIMORE, MIAMI, KANSAS CITY, AND JACKSONVILLE. DIVISION LEADERS IF THE SEASON STOP RIGHT NOW. INDIANAPOLIS WOULD BE AN AS WILDCARDS. ONLY THE TOP SEED GETS A BUY. KIRK: WHAT A RACE TO SEE WHO WILL GET THE NUMBER ONE OVERALL SEED IN THE NFC. DON'T FORGET MIAMI AND BALTIMORE PLAY EACH OTHER. KANSAS CITY, THERE'S A GAMES. AL: GOOD. MET -- PRESSURE. IN THE OTHER CONFERENCE, -- THAT TIME THE PRESSURE WAS PUT ON BY AUSTIN JOHNSON. NFC, YOU HAVE SAN FRANCISCO AND DALLAS RIGHT NOW. DETROIT AND TAMPA BAY DESPITE A 6-7 MARK. YOU HAVE THE EAGLES, VIKINGS, THE PACKERS GOING TO KIRK: NFC SOUTH, EVERY YEAR IT IS LIKE THAT. WE HAVE THE SAINTS NEXT WEEK IN LOS ANGELES. AL: RAMS HAVE WASHINGTON AT HOME. IT'S CAUGHT. MICHAEL MAYER, TOUCHDOWN EARLIER. MAKES HIS FOURTH CATCH OF THE KIRK: EVEN AS A FRESHMAN IN COLLEGE, HE LOOKED LIKE THAT. HE SHOWED UP ABOUT 250 POUNDS. JUST ONE OF THOSE GUYS THAT FOR THREE YEARS IN SOUTH BEND, YOU THOUGHT, WHERE IS HE GOING TO GO IN THE NFL? NOW THAT HE'S HAD A CHANCE TO GET USED TO THIS SYSTEM AND SPEED AND THE COMPLEXITY OF NFL DEFENSES, SEEMS TO BE TRENDING IN A GREAT DIRECTION WITHIN THE OFFENSIVE STRUCTURE. HE'S A REAL WEAPON IN THE MIDDLE. AL: O'CONNELL ROLLING. KEEPS HIS EYES DOWNFIELD. I SEE A GUY WEARING NUMBER 87 DAVE CASPER. THE GHOST. GHOST TO THE POST. THE HOLY ROLLER. THESE TWO TEAMS THROUGH THE YEARS, WHAT TOOK YOU GUYS SO LONG? INTO THE GAME AGAINST SAN DIEGO. KIRK: WERE YOU GAME? AL: NO. THE BALL IS MOVED FORWARD. WINDS UP IN THE HANDS OF CASPER CREATED A RULES CHANGE. KIRK: HE KICK THAT BALL ABOUT 10 YARDS. AL: LEAVE IT TO THE RAIDERS IN THOSE YEARS. THAT STOP THE FORWARD FUMBLE. BEGINNING OF THAT PLAY. AL: IT DID. KIRK: THE WHOLE CREW. AL: WE'VE SEEN A FEW. BUT NOT THAT ONE. THIRD AND 8. KIRK: GOD, THIS KID FOR A ROOKIE, SUCH GREAT COMMAND. AL: LOOKING SHARP. SHORT FIRST DOWN. AMEER ABDULLAH MAKES THAT. KIRK: THEY ARE GOING TO PUNTED AWAY WHICH IS FINE. AT THIS POINT, IT'S MEANINGLESS. YOU GO BACK TO THE DEVELOPING OF THIS YOUNG GUY. ANTONIO PURCHASED -- TELLING US, HE NEEDS TO LEARN TO PULL THE TRIGGER. YOU HAVE TO CHECK IT DOWN. DON'T TAKE THE SACK. DON'T WORRY ABOUT ALWAYS HAVING TO MAKE A PLAY. THE ONLY WAY YOU LEARN THAT IS YOU GO THROUGH THAT AS A YOUNG I THINK THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT NIGHT FOR NUMBER FOUR. AL: THE PUNT. BOUNCING OUT OF BOUNDS. >> MCCONNELL HAS HAD A BIG NIGHT BECAUSE HE'S GONE AFTER NUMBER 43 MICHAEL DAVIS ON THE OTHER SIDE. NOT JUST TRYING TO MAKE HIM MAKE TACKLES. THEY'VE GOTTEN BEHIND HIM. JACOBY MYERS WITH A HECK CATCH. NICE THROW. CROSSING AROUND TO THE ROOKIE TREY TUCKER FOR A TOUCHDOWN. YOU CAN SEE HIM FRUSTRATED AT TIMES. YOU SEE THESE NUMBERS. SIX RECEPTIONS, 105 YARDS, JUST IN THE FIRST HALF TONIGHT. AL: ON THE OUTSIDE. ISAIAH SPILLER SHUTTING IT DOWN. EACH TEAM COMING IN WITH FIVE WINS, EIGHT LOSSES. THE CHARGERS THOUGHT BOWL CONTENDERS. THE RAIDERS NOT QUITE THOUGHT THAT HIGHLY OF. THEY HAD JACOBS. BUT NOT TO BE. SECOND DOWN AND 5. THE THROW IS CAUGHT. TRIES TO GET FREE. YOU SEE WHERE THEY SPOTTED IT. IT'S TO BE SHORT. KIRK: YOU SEE THAT BODY LANGUAGE? PLAYERS WHO ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THE SEASON, WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. YOU COULD SEE IT FROM SPILLER, FROM EVERETT THERE. AL: ONE FOR 25 ON THIRD AND FOURTH DOWN THE LAST FEW GAMES. FINALLY, FINALLY. MOVE THOSE STICKS QUICKLY. NO FLAGS. TWO MINUTES LEFT IN THE THIRD. THAT'S ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE. DEAN SPANOS HAS HAD SOME GOOD TIMES AND SOME VERY FRUSTRATING TONIGHT OBVIOUSLY IS OF THE LATTER CATEGORY. FROM THE 31. BREAKS THE TACKLE. TURNS IT INTO A NICE RUN. THAT SHOULD BE FIRST DOWN BEFORE HE'S TACKLED BY KHALIL NICHOLS. KIRK: PATRICK GRAHAM TOLD ME ABOUT THE MATCH UP. HE HAD GOTTEN THE NEWS THAT KEENAN A HE SAID, WHEN I THOUGHT KEENAN ALLEN WAS IN THE GAME, EVERYTHING WILL RUN THROUGH HIM. THEN THEY FIND OUT KEENAN ALLEN IS OUT AND HE SAID, ECKLER HASN'T HAD A GREAT YEAR BUT NOW WE HAVE TO LOCK IN ON 30. NOT SO MUCH IN RUNNING GAME BUT CATCHING THE BACKFIELD. WE HAVEN'T SEEN A TON OF IT TONIGHT BUT THAT WAS THE FOCUS. AL: THEY HAVE LOCKED IN ON HIM. STICK DOWNFIELD. TWO DEEP AND INCOMPLETE. THERE WAS QUENTIN JOHNSTON. HE WAS THE NUMBER ONE PICK, THE ROOKIE OUT OF TCU. HE HASN'T HAD A GOOD YEAR TO THIS POINT. KIRK: IF YOU LOOK AT HIS RECEIVERS, THERE'S JUST NOT A LOT OF PRODUCTION TONIGHT. I KNOW YOU HAVE A YOUNG YOU GET DOWN EARLY BECOMES OBVIOUS WHAT THE PLAYCALLING IS. I KNOW PALMER HAD THE BIG TOUCHDOWN PLAY. WITHOUT KEENAN ALLEN, THERE'S NO ONE REALLY TO TURN TO ON THE MIKE WILLIAMS WENT DOWN EARLIER IN THE YEAR. AL: VERY EARLY IN THE SEASON. EVERY TEAM HAS HAD THEIR SHARE OF INJURIES. KELLY IS BANGED INTO THE BENCH. TAKES A COUPLE OF THE CHAIN GANG GUYS WITH HIM. JOEY BOSA IS ANOTHER HAVEN'T SEEN ON THE DEFENSIVE WILLIAMS, JUSTIN HERBERT. NO SYMPATHY FROM ANY OTHER TEAM THOUGH. EVERYBODY IS BANGED UP. TOTALLY AT THIS POINT. FINAL MINUTE. THAT WILL BE A FIRST DOWN. AFTER THEY WERE ONE FOR 25, THEY KICK -- PICK UP BACK-TO-BACK TO BACK THIRD DOWN CONVERSIONS. KIRK: THAT TIME, YOU SAW STICK GET BACK. HE HAD A GOOD IDEA BASED ON THE COVERAGE HE QUICKLY. AL: LITTLE HUDDLE HERE. STICK LOOKING. LOOK OUT FROM BEHIND. IT'S GOING TO BE RULED -- ALIVE AND GOING TO THE END ZONE IT'S RULED A TOUCHDOWN. JOHN JENKINS. HE WAS CAUGHT BY MALCOLM KOONCE WHO HAS HAD A GIGANTIC NIGHT. THAT WILL END THE QUARTER. OBVIOUSLY ALL SCORING PLAYS REVIEWED. KIRK: THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT KOONZ CONTINUES TO GIVE THE LEFT TACKLE RASHAWN SLATER A TOUGH AGAIN, I THINK ALL THE ATTENTION IS ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH MAXX CROSBY. INSTEAD, IT'S THE EFFORT OF NOT GIVING UP ON THAT PLAY. HE COMES UP WITH THAT BIG SECOND GET STICK TRIES TO AVOID CROSBY AND DOESN'T EVEN SEE HIM WHO COMES ALL THE WAY AROUND TO KNOCK THE BALL LOOSE. HOW ABOUT THE BIG FELLA JENKINS? COMING UP WITH THE TOUCHDOWN. AL: IN THE BACK DOOR. JENKINS, 34-YEAR-OLD DEFENSIVE TACKLE, 11TH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE. AL: JENKINS IS LISTED AT 6'3", 327 POUNDS. AWAY HE GOES. KIRK: ANTONIO PIERCE HAVING FUN WITH THE BIG FELLA. HE'S ALSO 34 YEARS OLD. NOT ONLY IS HE A BIG DEFENSIVE TACKLE -- I WONDER HOW MANY TIMES IN HIS WHOLE CAREER HE'S PICKED UP A FUMBLE AND HAD A CHANCE TO RUN IT TH HE IS STILL TICKLED DOWN THERE. AL: FIRST SEASON AS A RATER. THE LAST TWO YEARS WITH THE DOLPHINS. CHECK HIM OUT AGAIN HERE. KIRK: THIS IS GRE WILL SHOW THE SPEED OF WHAT HE'S CROSBY FORCES STICK TO STEP UP. ENDS UP DISLODGING THE BALL. HERE'S THE BIG MAN RIGHT HERE. HE GETS HIS HANDS ON IT. HE SEES A GOAL LINE I UP TO 17 MILES PER OUR. JUST TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE. I KNOW, -- TYREE GALE GOES 22 OR 23. HE'S GOING THROUGH THE WHOLE STORY OF WHAT HE DID. PUT YOUR TREADMILL AT 70 MILES PER HOUR AND YOU CAN APPRECIATE WHAT BIG JOHN JENKINS DUSTED. AL: FASTER THAN BENNY HILL. BUTLER MAKES THAT TACKLE. KAYLEE: I THINK EVERYBODY IN A RATER'S UNIFORM HAS MADE THEIR WAY OVER TO JENKINS TO LOVE HIM AND HELP THEM CELEBRATE THAT MOMENT. A COUPLE OF THE GUYS WERE YELLING, WE HAVE TO CHECK THE GPS. YOU HAD TO BE GOI THEY WILL BE DISAPPOINTED WHEN I TELL THEM HE DIDN' TELL THEM HE DIDN'T HIT 20 MILES PER HOUR. THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE. KIRK: 17 ISN'T TERRIBLE. AL: AND DIDN'T NEED A PITSTOP. WILL CLAPP THE CENTER IS NOW DOWN IN AN INJURY TIMEOUT. >> THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL ON IT'S ON. >> THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL IS ON. NEXT WEEK, T THE RAMS. STREAM THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL ONLY ON PRIME. TONIGHT ON TNF NIGHT CAP, OUR TEAM CAPS OFF THE GAME WITH FUN, FANS, AND FOOTBALL'S BEST. TNF NIGHT CAP, ALLSTATE AFTER THE GAME. AL: WELL, THIS AGONIZING NIGHT FOR THE CHARGERS CONTINUES AS WILL CLAPP NEEDS TO BE ASSISTED OFF THE FIELD ON THE CART. CORY LESLIE WAS THERE STARTING CENTER EARLY IN THE SEASON. HE WENT ON IR. CLAPP HAS COME INTO START 10. NOW YOU HAVE BRENDEN JAIMES, NUMBER 64. HE COMES IN TO TAKE THAT SPOT. KIRK: THAT WAS A BIG LOSS FOR LESLIE, ONE OF THE TOP CENTERS OUT AFTER THREE GAMES. AL: SECOND DOWN OH BABY. UNBELIEVABLE. JACK JONES. HE'LL DO IT AGAIN. I MEAN, THERE ARE BAD DREAMS AND THEN THERE ARE CRAZY BAD DREAMS. FOR THE CHARGERS, IT'S BEEN THAT KIND OF A NIGHT. KIRK: I'LL TELL YOU, JACK JONES WHO PLAYS A LOT MORE MAN, HE JUST READ THIS. WHEN ECKLER WENT IN MOTION, HE MUST HAVE SEEN THIS AND HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS COMING. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. IT'S LIKE HE WAS IN THE HUDDLE. HE REACTS QUICKER THAN ANYBODY FROM THE OFFENSE. IT'S LIKE HE KNEW THAT THIS WAS THE PLAY THEY RUN TO GET HIM TO 30 AND HE SAID, NOT ON MY WATCH. HE STEPPED RIGHT IN FRONT OF IT ONE-HANDED AND WALKS INTO THE AL: MOST POINTS THE RAIDERS HAVE EVER SCORED. 63. YOU HAVE 14:30 LEFT IN THE GAME. MOST POINTS THE CHARGERS HAVE EVER GIVEN UP. KIRK: JACK JONES, HE'S A GUY THAT HAS HAD TO BATTLE THROUGH. HE WAS LET GO BY THE PATS. PICKED UP BY ANTONIO PIE COACHED HIM AT HIGH SCHOOL AND AT ARIZONA STATE. BELIEVES IN ANOTHER CHANCE AND ANOTHER NOTHING HE COULD DO THERE. AS SOON AS HE READ THAT, SAW THE FORMATION, GOOD INDICATOR FOR HIM TO JUMP. AL: HERBERT IS HE PUT STAKE IN. HE WAS THE BACKUP? MAX DUGGAN. RICKY OUT OF TCU WHO IS SECOND TO CALEB WILLIAMS AND THE HEISMAN BALLOTING LAST YEAR. HE HASN'T PLAYED A LOT. KIRK: JUST NOT A LOT OF OPTIONS FOR THIS CHARGERS TEAM. OTHER THAN JUST GETTING REPS, IT OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T MATTER. AL: 63 POINTS, THE MOST EVER IN RAIDERS HISTORY. KIRK: ALL THEY NEED IS 10 MORE FOR THE NFL RECORD. ONLY 10. AL: NO PROBLEM. A TEAM THAT WAS SHUT OUT LAST WEEK. TONIGHT, A VERY DIFFERENT STORY. AL: THE CHARGERS WITH FIVE TURNOVERS AND BURNED AFTER EVERY ONE OF THEM. REMEMBER MILLS REFEREE? KIRK: SURE D. AL: HE WOULD WAIVE IT OFF RIGHT SECOND AND 9. KIRK: DIABLO IS DOWN. AL: DIVINE DEABLO. KIRK: THAT' KIRK: THAT'S TAKING ADVANTAGE. THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD PERCENTAGE. FIVE TAKEAWAYS, FIVE TOUCHDOWNS. SO YOU GO FROM ONE GAME WHERE YOU JUST WANT UP HIGH FROM EVERYBODY TO THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE END OF THE SPECTRUM IF YOU ARE THE RAIDERS. NOW IT'S THE CHARGERS. AL: AS WE SAID GOING TO COMMERCIAL, IT'S THE NFL WHERE ANYTHING HAPPENS. KIRK: THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE ALL THESE BIG BUILDERS OUT HERE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AL: AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH. >> FIRST TIME OUT OF THE HALF. KIRK: NEXT WEEK, HOME GAME. AL: HOW ABOUT THAT? THE SAINTS AND THE RAMS. THEY ARE IN THE PLAYOFF HUNT THEY BEAT WASHINGTON THIS WEEK. WE WILL TAKE IT OFF NEXT WEEK WITH PREGAME AT 7:00 EASTERN FROM SOPHIA. -- SOFI. ALLEGIANT STADIUM. VEGAS HAS BECOME A SPORTS MECCA. REMEMBER, THIS IS THE HOME OF THE STANLEY CUP CHAMPIONS. KIRK: AND THEY'VE BEEN GOOD PRETTY MUCH FROM THE JUMP. AL: FROM THE GET-GO. BENEFICIARIES OF A VERY LUCRATIVE DRAFT. SPEAKING OF THAT, YOU HAVE A GOLDEN NIGHTS. THIS TOWN LOVES THEIR CHAMPIONS. YOU HAVE THE RAIDERS REBUILDING THEIR STADIUM. THE ACES OWNED BY CHAMPIONSHIPS. THE SUPER BOWL WILL BE PLAYED HERE IN FEBRUARY. THE STADIUM OPENED IN 2028. I GUARANTEE ON THE NBA OUTLOOK. THEY AND SEATTLE WOULD BE THE NEXT EXPANSION FRANCHISES. STICK THROWS, IT IS CAUGHT. KIRK:3 KIRK: ISN'T IT AMAZING HOW FAR SPORTS HAS COME IN THIS CITY? YOU DID NOT WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT, SPORTS GAMBLING AND PROFESSIONAL SPORTS, EVERYTHIN ASSOCIATED WITH IT, YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE ENVISIONED FRANCHISES NOW, EVERYBODY IS COMING IN. MOVING AHEAD IS JOSHUA KELLEY. THE CHARGERS WILL GO HOME. THEIR NEXT GAME IS SATURDAY AGAINST BUFFALO. THEN THEY GO TO DENVER. THEN AT HOME AGAINST KANSAS CITY. NOT EASY. WHAT A NIGHT FOR THAT GUY. 241 YARDS, FOUR TOUCHDOWNS. I THINK HE HAS SECURED THE STARTING SPOT. REVERSING DIRECTIONS. UP TO THE 41. THE REMAINING SCHEDULES. THE RAIDERS GO TO KANSAS CITY, GO TO INDIANAPOLIS, AND WITH DENVER HERE. KIRK: THIS IS A GREAT NIGHT, BUT THEY WILL HAVE TO SWEEP THE THREE REMAINING GAMES THEY HAVE AND NEED SOME HELP SITTING AT 9-8. AL: STICK. HE GETS OUT, RUNS. SLIDES TO A STOP AT THE 48 FOR A KIRK: I TOLD YOU HIS L BE A FACTOR. AL: EVENTUALLY. IT ONLY TOOK 48 MINUTES. KIRK: THAT IS WHAT I THOUGHT WE WOULD SEE TONIGHT, HIS ABILITY TO IMPROVISE AND SCRAMBLE, TRY TO GET FIRST DOWNS. VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU ARE USED TO SEEING WITH JUSTIN HERBERT. THIS GAME GOT AWAY FROM HIM AND THIS TEAM IN A HURRY. DOWN 21-0 IN THE FIRST QUARTER. AL: STICK SHOOT SET OUT. -- SHOOTS IT OUT. THIS CROWD SMELLS BLOOD. KIRK: THEY ARE NOT LETTING UP, JUST LIKE THE RAIDERS. AL: IT IS LIKE THE ROMAN COLISEUM RIGHT NOW. SECOND AND 10. HE GETS TO THE FIRST DOWN. THE BACKUP QUARTERBACKS HAVING A SUPER NIGHT, YOU GO BACK TO TENNESSEE. KIRK: IT LOOKED LIKE CINCINNATI WAS DOWN AFTER JOE BURROW WAS DONE, THEN THE BIG GAME IN JACKSONVILLE AND FOLLOWS IT UP WITH ANOTHER WIN LAST WEEK. I THINK THERE IS A PREMIUM ON DEPTH ON OFFENSIVE LINE PLAY, AND THAT BACKUP QUARTERBACK. AL: NO GAIN. SPILLER. THE INJURY BUG HAS HIT ABOUT EVERYBODY. AARON RODGERS, FOURTH PLAY OF THE SEASON. COUSINS AND JONES AND WATSON AND BURROW AND PICKETT AND HERBERT. KIRK: WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS AN OFFENSIVE LINE, I THINK IT IS A COMBINATION OF BACKUP QUARTERBACK PLAY AND JUST SEEING OFFENSIVE LINE DECIMATED IT SEEMS EVERY WEEK. AL: THE THROW, AND IT IS PALMER. JOSHUA PALMER PULLS IT IN. KIRK: ZONE COVERAGE, YOU HAVE TO GET THAT BALL OVER THE TOP OF THE LINEBACKERS. WHAT A GREAT JOB OF SHOWING WHAT HE IS CAPABLE OF THROWING THIS FOOTBALL. THIS IS THE AREA HE HAS IMPROVED THE MOST IN FIVE YEARS. HE CAME IN AS A GOOD ATHLETE AND PLAYMAKER. HE WOULD BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH HE HAS WORKED ON THAT ASPECT OF HIS GAME. ONE OF THE FIRST CHANCES WE HAVE SEEN HIM THROWING IT DOWN FIELD IT HAD TO BE IT WAS. AL: STICK TO THE END ZONE, AND THAT IS A TOUCHDOWN. ALEX ERICKSON. YOU LOOK AT STICK'S NUMBERS, PRETTY GOOD, 240 YARDS, TWO TOUCHDOWNS. KIRK: WHENEVER IT COMES OVER, YOU GET MOTION HERE, WATCH THE SAFETY COME DOWN. THAT CHANGES THE COVERAGE. HE HAS TO SEE THAT AS THE BALL IS SNAPPED SO IT OPENS UP THE SKINNY POST FOR A TOUCHDOWN. GOOD JOB OF SEEING THAT AFTER THE MOTION. TOUGH TO DO FOR A GUY WITHOUT A LOT OF EXPERIENCE. AL: EXTRA POINT IS GOOD. 8:30 TO GO IN THE FOURTH. 63-14 KIRK: WE WI CROSBY WHO ALWAYS GIVES TREMENDOUS EFFORT NO MATTER WHAT HE IS FACING. HERE IS THAT SPIN MOVE WHERE HE ALMOST GETS STICK TO FORCE THE BALL OUT. I LOVE TO WATCH HIM PLAY. EVEN WHEN HE DOES NOT MAKE THE PLAY, HE HELPS FORCE THE PLAY. THERE IS THE BIG FELLA, JENKINS. HE GOT UP TO 70 MPH. -- 17 MPH. AL: THAT IS LIKE FORMULA ONE. CARTER. HE TAKES IT BACK TO THE 24. KIRK: IT HAS BEEN AN UNUSUAL NIGHT AS FAR AS THESE BOLDEN TAKES THIS INTO THE ENDZONE. THIS WAS FOR A TOUCHDOWN, THIS WITH A SACK BY KOONTZ. UNBELIEVABLE JOB ONE-HANDED. GOOD JOB RECOGNIZING THAT. MARK DAVIS CANNOT BELIEVE SOME OF THESE TOUCHDOWNS HE HAS SEEN. AL: HE IS GOING, WHERE WAS SOME OF THIS LAST WEEK? UP TO THE 29 YARD LINE, DAVANTE IN THE NFL CHAMPIONSHIP GAME, 1940, THEY WON 73-0. WASHINGTON, 72 AGAINST THE GIANTS IN 1966. THE DOLPHINS THIS YEAR AGAINST DENVER. THE RAMS BACK IN 1970, 70 SECOND AND 3. BUYING TIME, THROWING, BROKEN UP. THIRD AND 3. KIRK: DAVANTE ADAMS ON AN OPTION ROUTE BUT THE CHARGERS TOOK HIM AWAY. TWO DIFFERENT DEFENDERS ON THE OUTSIDE AND INSIDE. HE IS NOT THE MOST NIMBLE. HE IS NOT A STATUE BUT HE IS ABLE TO GET AWAY FROM PRESSURE. JUST A NICE PLAY BY JAMES. AL: THEY STOP HIM SHORT OF THE THAT IS ABDULLAH, MAKING IT FOURTH DOWN AND 1. EVEN THOUGH THE CROWD WANTS THEM TO GO FOR IT, THEY WILL NOT. KIRK: THERE IS NO WAY THEY ARE BOOING. AL: THEY WANT TO SEE 70. KIRK: THERE IS STILL A LITTLE OVER SEVEN MINUTES TO GO. WITH ALL THESE UNUSUAL TOUCHDOWNS, YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW THEY WILL SCORE. AL: YOU CAN ERASE A 49 POINT DEFICIT IN SIX MINUTES. CAUGHT AT THE 18. HE HAS ONE MAN TO BEAT, AND HE WILL TAKE IT TO THE END ZONE BUT RAIDERS ARE SIGNALING I AGAINST THE CHARGERS. >> HOLDING ON THE RETURN TEAM. 10 YARDS FROM THE SPOT OF THE FOUL. LOS ANGELES KEEPS THE BALL, THAT NEGATES WHAT WOULD BE A TOUCHDOWN RETURN. 6:53 REMAINING. KIRK: YOU WERE THERE THE FIRST OR SECOND NIGHT. AL: SECOND NIGHT, UNBELIEVABLE, LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN. BALL AT THE 45 YARD LINE. KIRK: IS IT HOW HIGH IT GOES UP? AL: THE VISUALS. U2 WAS PLAYING, AND THEY LOOK TINY COMPARED TO THE REST OF IT. IT IS HARD TO EXPLAIN. KIRK: HOW WERE YOUR SEATS? AL: VERY GOOD. [LAUGHTER] THERE ARE NO BAD SEATS BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE ACTION IS ABOVE YOU. BAND? AL: I DON'T KNOW, IT IS A GOOD QUESTION. IT IS AMAZING. THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF STUFF GOING ON, A BIG EYEBALL THAT LOOKS AT YOU. IT IS CRAZY, MAN. BUT IT IS VEGAS, TOO. JUST A BLOCK AND A HALF OFF THE STRIP. GOOD LUCK PARKING. CAUGHT FOR A FIRST DOWN. MAKING THAT GRAB IS JOSHUA PALMER, TACKLED BY TYLER HALL. KIRK: THE COMBINATION OF MAXX CROSBY AND A LOT OF STARTERS UPFRONT BEING OUT, AND SOFTER COVERAGE HAS GIVEN STICK A CHANCE TO OPERATE BETTER AND WITH MORE TIME, SOFTER COVERAGE, HE IS HITTING A LOT OF SLANTS AND UNDERNEATH ROUTES. AL: IN A GAME LIKE THIS SPEND SOME TIME ON THE BENCH. KIRK: HE IS PROBABLY BUMMED OUT AL: HE PLAYED 97% OF THE SNAPS, AND TONIGHT IT IS IN T RANGE. JOSHUA KELLEY TAKING IT INSIDE THE 40. KIRK: EVERYBODY IN THE NFL WORKS HARD BUT YOU TELL ME TALK TO HIM, I AM ALWAYS TAKEN BACK ON THE COMMITMENT HE MAKES. HE TALKED ABOUT HOW IT IS TOUGH TO GO ON VACATION BECAUSE HE HAS TO HAVE HIS FOOD PREPPED AND IT IS HARD TO DO ON VACATION. HE IS EXCESSIVE. HE STARTS AROUND JANUARY 30. HE CRANKS FROM THERE. AL: FROM THE OUTSIDE AROUND THE EDGE PICKING UP THE FIRST DOWN. JOSHUA KELLEY. >> I ASKED AROUND TRYING TO FIND THE BEST DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IT IS LIKE TO FACE MAXX CROSBY ON AUSTIN EKELER SAID, IMAGINE A FEROCIOUS WEREWOLF TRYING TO STALK ITS PREY, NONSTOP UNTIL THE WHISTLE BLOWS. THAT IS WHAT CROSBY IS, RELENTLESS. EKELER DID CREDIT HIS FORMER OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR FOR POINTING THAT OUT TO HIM, A WEREWOLF. AL: FIRST DOWN HERE. KIRK: GOING BACK TO HIS FIRST FEW YEARS, HE SAID, -- I STUDY WHO I AM GOING UP AGAINST BUT I AM TOO BUSY STUDYING MYSELF. WHETHER IT IS PRACTICE OR GAMES, ALMOST TRYING TO LOOK AT WHERE IS A WEAKNESS OR STRENGTH, WHERE CAN I GET BETTER, AND HE REFERENCED ROD MARINELLI AS HELPING TEACH HIM THAT EARLY IN HIS CAREER. AL: HE IS VERY OPEN ABOUT ALL THE PROBLEMS HE HAS HAD. HE HAS COMPLETELY COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE. A FLAG HERE. >> NEUTRAL ZONE INFRACTION. DEFENSE #97 JUMPED INTO THE NEUTRAL ZONE AND BECAUSE THE OFFENSIVE PLAYER TO MOVE. STILL SECOND DOWN. KIRK: THEY ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT ROBINSON, AND THE ROOKIE, WILSON. THEY THINK MAXX CROSBY GETS A LOT OF ATTENTION FROM THE YOU HAVE THREE OTHER GUYS THEY FEEL CAN WIN ONE-ON-ONE. AL: A LITTLE FLIP HERE. AND HE IS SLUNG DOWN. THE ROOKIE OUT OF FLORIDA, SIXTH ROUND PICK, MADE THAT TACKLE. UNDER 4:00 TO GO. SOME ROOM INSIDE THE 10. SPILLER TO THE SIX YARD LINE. KIRK: HE WILL SHOW YOU GREAT PATIENCE. HE IS MORE OF AN OUTSIDE ZONE RUNNER, SO HE HAS SHOWN THAT ABILITY TO PRESS LATE AND FIND THAT CREE SAND HIT IT. -- FIND THAT CREASE AND HIT IT. AL: TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TIMEOUT TO SHOW YOU THE PLAYOFF PICTURE ONE MORE TIME. RAVENS RIGHT NOW WOULD HAVE THE ONE SEED AND THE BYE. JACKSONVILLE WOULD HOST A GAME IN THE WILD-CARD ROUND. TEXANS, BRONCOS, BENGALS, BILLS. NFC, 49ERS ARE ALREADY IN THE PLAYOFFS. DALLAS, DETROIT, TAMPA BAY WOULD HOST A PLAYOFF GAME. KIRK: DID YOU SEE THE SHOT OF ANTONIO PIERCE? HE IS STILL DOWN THERE, WHICH OF COURSE YOU WILL SEE, BUT YOU DO NOT ALWAYS SEE HEAD COACHES SHOWING THAT KIND OF PASSION. HE IS CHALLENGING THESE BACKUPS TO JUST GIVE UP AND LET THEM SCORE. HE WANTS TO SEE THEM FIGHT AND COMPETE. AL: SECOND AND 3. CANNOT GET OUTSIDE. SPILLER IS STOPPED. KIRK: YOU THINK ABOUT ANTONIO PIERCE, AS A PLAYER WHAT HE WAS ABLE TO DO. HE PLAYED WITH FIRE. THAT IS THE ASPECT HE BRINGS AS A COACH, THIS TEAM, THIS DEFENSE FEEDS OFF OF, THE GUY HAS BEEN THERE AND KNOWS WHAT IT TAKES. I LIKE HOW HE CHALLENGES THEM. AL: THIRD AND THREE. HE GOES THE OTHER WAY, MAKING THAT GRAB IS QUENTIN JOHNSTON. STICK HIT JOHNSON FOR A TOUCHDOWN LAST WEEK, GOES BACK TO THE ROOKIE AGAIN. THE ROOKIE OUT OF TCU, AND THIS IS THEIR THIRD TOUCHDOWN OF THE KIRK: STICK WORKING WITH MOTION WITH PALMER. HE WANTS TO GO TO 82, GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE LEFT. THREE ON THE BACKSIDE FOR THAT AL: HE HAD A TD AGAINST DETROIT EARLIER IN THE SEASON BUT THAT LONG GAME LAST WEEK IN THE LOSS AT HOME TO DENVER. THE EXTRA POINT IS GOOD. 2:30KIRK: AT LEAST THE CHARGERS OF SHUT IT DOWN IN THE FIRST THE OFFENSE HAS BEEN ABLE TO PUT SOME POINTS UP. 42-0 AT HALFTIME, THEY PUT 21 UP IN THE SECOND HALF. THAT IS A GREAT NUMBER, THE LAST FOUR GAMES. AL: TOUCHBACK. NEXT THURSDAY, SOPHIA STADIUM, THE SAINTS IN TOWN. THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL. LAST TIME I DID A GAME IN THIS STADIUM WAS THE LAST GAME OF THE 2021 SEASON. THE RAIDERS AND THE CHARGERS WERE MEETING. THE WINNER WAS GOING TO GO TO THE PLAYOFFS UNLESS THEY WOUND UP IN A TIE, AND BOTH TEAMS -- WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF THAT? KIRK: AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME YOU WERE THINKING THE STEELERS NEED A TIE, THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN. AL: CHRIS COLLINSWORTH AND I WERE DRIVING OUT HERE, AND HE SAID, WHAT IF THERE IS A TIE? I SAID, GET OUT OF HERE. THE COACH WAS READY TO PLAY FOR THE TIME COME ON GET THEM BOTH INTO THE PLAYOFFS. THEN CARLSON KICKED THE FIELD GOAL THAT SENT PITTSBURGH TO THE PLAYOFFS AND THE CHARGERS HOME. KIRK: YOU HAVE CALLED SO MANY BIG GAMES, SUPER BOWLS -- THAT IS A MEMORABLE GAME BECAUSE IT IS SUCH AN UNLIKELY OUTCOME. AL: HERBERT WAS PHENOMENAL,TEELE ANOTHER UNBELIEVABLY AGONIZING DEFEAT, ALMOST SELF-INFLICTED THAT NIGHT FOR THE CHARGERS. 2:00 UNTIL THE RAIDERS CAN CELEBRATE. THE CHARGERS, THE ONLY GOOD NEWS IS THE FLIGHT HOME IS ABOUT 45 MINUTES. THIS STARTS WEEK 15. SOME OF THE OTHER GAMES ON THE SCHEDULE, MINNESOTA GOES TO THEN IN EARLY GAME, DALLAS AND BUFFALO SUNDAY. BALTIMORE AGAINST JACKSONVILLE ON SUNDAY NIGHT. THE MONDAY NIGHTER IS PHILADELPHIA GOING TO SEATTLE. THAT WILL MAKE IT FOURTH DOWN WHITE GETS STOPPED. EIGHT DIFFERENT PLAYERS SCORING A TD IN THIS GAME, FIRST TIME SINCE 1950 WHEN THE RAMS DID IT. THEY SEND IN THE PUNT GROUP. WHAT A NIGHT FOR THAT MAN. 20-34, 248 YARDS AND FOUR THAT ONE WILL SKIP OUT OF BOUNDS AROUND THE 20 YARD LINE. :31 LEFT. KIRK: IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE AIDAN O'CONNELL IS IN HIS DEVELOPMENT AND IN HIS CAREER, GOING THROUGH WHAT HE WENT THROUGH LAST WEEK AND SOME OF THE MURMURS AROUND TOWN WONDERING. THE MEDIA SAID, IS THIS TOO MUCH FOR YOU? HE HAD TO SIT THERE AND TAKE IT, AND IT IS PART OF GROWING UP. I THINK HIS RESPONSE TO THE DIVERSITY SAYS A LOT ABOUT HIM AND WHAT THIS OFFENSE IS CAPABLE OF DOING WITH HIM AT THE HELM. AL: A FEW MORE HERE FOR THE GUY DOWNSTAIRS CALLING THE GAME UPSTAIRS NOW. HE IS PROBABLY ON HIS WAY TO THE LOCKER ROOM TO CELEBRATE. THAT WILL WRAP IT UP. UNBELIEVABLY, A TEAM THAT GETS SHUT OUT FOUR DAYS AGO AND LAYS 63 ON THE CHARGERS. 63-21. THE RAIDERS GO TO 6-8. THE CHARGERS GO TO 5-9. THE RAIDERS GET READY FOR THEIR FINAL THREE GAMES OF THE SEASON WITH STILL A CHANCE -- A CHANCE
