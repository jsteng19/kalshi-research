RELY ON MITCH TRUBISKY. AL: THERE IS PICKETT WATCHING FROM A BOX UPSTAIRS. BILL BELICHICK HAS BEEN THE COACH OF THE PATRIOTS SINCE 2000. MIKE TOMLIN TOOK OVER IN 2007. THE TWO LONG-TENURED COACHES MEETING FOR THE 13TH TIME, COUNTING POSTSEASON GAMES, WITH BELICHICK WINNING NINE AND TOMLIN THREE. STEELERS DEFER. TY MONTGOMERY IS BACK TO RECEIVE. A TOUCHBACK BEGINS THINGS WITH BAILEY ZAPPE LEADING HIS OUT TO THE 25 YARD LINE. ZAPPE TOOK OVER FOR MAC JONES LAST WEEK. NOT TOO OFTEN DOES A GUY GET SHUT OUT AND WIND UP WITH ANOTHER START BUT HERE WE ARE, THE SECOND WEEK IN A ROW FOR HIM. KIRK: THAT IS WHERE WE ARE IN 2023 WITH THE PATRIOTS. THEY ARE LOOKING FOR CONSISTENCY AND EFFICIENT PLAY FROM THE QUARTERBACK POSITION. LET'S SEE IF BAILEY ZAPPE CAN DO THAT. AL: LONGTIME COWBOYS ZEKE ELLIOTT IS NOW THE PRIMARY RUNNING BACK, RHAMONDRE STEVENSON WAS HURT LAST WEEK. HE GOES NOWHERE. MINKAH FITZPATRICK, WHO HIMSELF MISSED SEVERAL GAMES. YOU HAVE AN INJURED PLAYER, THAT IS T.J. WATT. OH, BOY. HE GOT HURT LAST WEEK. ON THE VERY FIRST PLAY OF THE GAME, FITZPATRICK MAKES THE PLAY. WATT, FORTUNATELY, GETTING UP ON HIS FEET. KIRK: HE TOOK A BLOW FROM ELLIOTT. WATCH HIM FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE KNEE INTO THE CHEST AREA OF T.J. WATT. INTO THE FACE, ACTUALLY. ALL HIS MOMENTUM. HE IS A BIG MAN AT 235 POUNDS. AL: HE GOES TO THE SIDELINE, DOES WATT. THAT MEANS NUMBER 51 WILL COME IN FOR AT LEAST ONE PLAY. SECOND DOWN, 10. ZAPPE'S FIRST PASS IS A FLOATER. IT IS CAUGHT. ELLIOTT WITH A NICE MOVE. ZEKE, PICKING UP THE FIRST DOWN. ELLIOTT WAS PICKED UP IN THE OFF-SEASON. DALLAS LEAD HIM GO. TONY POLLARD TOOK OVER. RHAMONDRE STEVENSON HAS BEEN THE NUMBER 1 BACK, BUT UNTIL STEVENSON COMES BACK, IT WILL BE ZEKE. KIRK: REALLY GOOD DESIGN BY BILL O' O'BRIEN. RIGHT AS A SUBSTITUTE COMES IN FOR T.J. WATT, HE TESTS HIM AS A PASS DEFENDER IN THE FLAT. AL: ZAPPE IN THE POCKET. ZAPPE, DEEP DOWN FIELD AND THAT IS PULLED IN BY JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER, THE FORMER STEELER WHO COMES HOME, AND A BIG GAINER THERE, 37 YARDS. COVERED WELL BUT THE PAST IS RIGHT THERE. KIRK: KAZEE NEVER LOCATES THE FOOTBALL. ONE AN EFFORT BY JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER TO COME BACK TO THE FOOTBALL AND SHOW HIS STRENGTH. THAT IS WHAT HE HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR, STRONG HANDS. AL: WATT COMES BACK IN. SMITH-SCHUSTER LAST TWO KANSAS CITY, WON A RING. ALEX HIGHSMITH MAKES THE STOP ON SECOND AND 9. KIRK: GOOD TO SEE T.J. WATT BACK OUT ON THE FIELD FOR PITTSBURGH. HE HAD TO RECALIBRATE, GET HIMSELF READY. HOW ABOUT THE START FOR NEW ENGLAND? THIS IS AN OFFENSE THAT HAS NOT HAD A LOT OF GOOD THINGS GOING. WE EXPECTED THEM TO RUN ON THE FOOTBALL AND LEAN ON ZEKE BILL O'BRIEN COMES OUT TESTING THE STEELERS ONE-ON-ONE DOWNFIELD. AL: WHY NOT? DEVANTE PARKER IS OUT TONIGHT, THEIR NUMBER ONE RECEIVER. ZAPPE THROWS THAT ONE AWAY. THIRD DOWN AND 9. KIRK: ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT THROWING ON EARLY DOWNS, BILL O'BRIEN KNOWS IT WILL HELP HIS OFFENSIVE LINE. THERE IS A MAJOR CONCERN WITH ALEX HIGHSMITH ON ONE SIDE AND T.J. WATT ON THE OTHER TO AVOID THESE SITUATIONS, THIRD AND LONG, WHERE WATT AND HIGHSMITH CAN COME AFTER YOU. AL: THEY ARE ALSO AN OFFENSIVE LINE THAT HAS BEEN A TROUBLE SPOT FOR NEW ENGLAND. ZAPPE. COMING OUT OF THE SIDE DOOR AND HE WILL PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN AS HE SCOOTS OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 14 YARD LINE. KIRK: WHAT A GREAT JOB OF STEPPING UP. WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE EDGE PRESSURE. WHEN YOU GET EDGE PRESSURE HERE AND HERE, YOU HAVE TO STEP UP IN THE POCKET. HE CLIMBS AND DOES A GOOD JOB OF PUTTING LEVI WALLACE IN A TOUGH SPOT. HE CAN STOP THE QUARTERBACK AND GIVE UP THE THROW OR SIT IN COVERAGE AND LET ZAPPE USE HIS ATHLETIC ABILITY TO PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN. AL: GOT 11 ON A THIRD DOWN AND 9. BALL AT THE 14. ELLIOTT AGAIN. SHOWING SOME SHIFTING THIS. TWO-TIME RUSHING CHAMPION. SECOND DOWN. KIRK: RHAMONDRE STEVENSON GOES DOWN WITH A HIGH ANKLE. TALKING TO BILL O' TALKING TO BILL O'BRIEN THIS WEEK, AT THIS STAGE OF HIS CAREER, ELLIOTT MIGHT BE DOWN A STEP OR TWO BUT HE WORKS HARD DURING PRACTICE AND HAS A GREAT ATTITUDE. WE HAVE REALLY BEEN IMPRESSED WITH WHAT HE HAS BROUGHT. THE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO GIVING HIM THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE WHAT HE CAN DO TONIGHT. AL: PATRIOTS IN FOREIGN TERRITORY. THEY DID NOT GET INSIDE E CHARGER 30 LAST WEEK. FLOATS A PASS TO ZEKE, DIVES, TOUCHDOWN. I MEAN, GO FIGURE. THEY PLAY 60 MINUTES AT HOME LAST WEEK, DO NOT COME CLOSE TO SCORING. JUST LIKE THAT, OFF THE BAT, 75 YARDS IN A PLACE TO TAKE THE LEAD. KIRK: WITH THE INJURIES THE STEELERS HAVE AT IT LINEBACKER, THE BIG QUESTION THESE LINEBACKERS DO AGAINST TIGHT ANDS AND RUNNING BACKS? A PICK. IT ALLOWS FOR A NICE EASY READ AND THROW FOR ZAPPE. JUST LIKE THAT, THE PATRIOTS LOOK GOOD ON THIS OPENING DRIVE. AL: FOURTH ROUND PICK OUT OF MARYLAND BOOTS THAT ONE THROUGH. THAT ONE TOOK ONLY 3:48. A STUNNING BEGINNING FOR THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS AND WHAT FIGURES TO BE A LOW-SCORING GAME. 7-0. HEADS ON PRIME VIDEO. -- HOLIDAY HITS ON PRIME VIDEO. WATCH FAVORITES. HOLIDAY HAPPY PLACE ON PRIME MEANWHILE, THEY ARE STILL WORKING ON WATT. HE TOOK A SHOT AND CAME BACK INTO THE GAME. MEANWHILE, PITTSBURGH WILL GET THE BALL AND GODWIN IGWEBUIKE WILL TAKE THIS ONE BACK. BREAKS A TACKLE AT THE 20 AND GETS RUN DOWN AT THE 31 BY JONATHAN JONES. AND NOW MITCH TRUBISKY COMES IN. NO STRANGER TO STARTING. HE WAS WITH CHICAGO STARTING IN 2017. NUMBER 2 OVERALL PICK IN THE DRAFT. HE WAS GOING TO BE THE NEXT SID LUCKMAN, SOMETHING CHICAGO HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR FROM ABOUT THE 17TH CENTURY. HE HAD A GOOD ROOKIE YEAR AND A GOOD SECOND YEAR, AND THEN HE ENDED UP IN BUFFALO AND THEN HERE LAST YEAR. NAJEE HARRIS IS THE RUNNING BACK. PLAY ACTION. GOOD PROTECTION. NOW HE HAS TO SCRAMBLE. HE CAN RUN! TRUBISKY WILL PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN ON HIS FIRST PLAY OF THE AN OVERLOOKED PART OF HIS GAME, THE FACT HE IS A DECENT RUNNER. KIRK: HE REALLY IS. HE BRINGS THAT ELEMENT. WHEN COVERAGE IS GOOD, THE LINEBACKERS SINK BACK IN COVERAGE, HE MAKES A GOOD DECISION TO PULL IT DOWN AND USE HIS FEET AND GET THE FIRST DOWN. HE WILL PLAY WELL BUT CAN HE AVOID THAT CRITICAL MISTAKE? PUTTING THE BALL INTO COVERAGE, ESPECIALLY IN A GAME LIKE THIS THAT YOU THINK WOULD BE LOW-SCORING? AL: AFTER A 15 YARD GAIN, THEY GIVE IT TO THE RUNNING BACK, HARRIS, WHO GETS OUT TO THE 47 YARD LINE. KIRK: I THINK A BIG QUESTION COMING INTO TONIGHT FOR MITCH IS CAN THE RUNNING GAME GET THE YARDS THEY NEED TO GET AGAINST THIS DEFENSE OF THE PATRIOTS? ONE THING THE GETS LOST IS HOW WELL THEY HAVE PLAYED ON THAT SIDE OF THE FOOTBALL. THEY ARE TOUGH TO RUN THE BALL AGAINST. 3.2 YARDS PER CARRY, BEST IN THE NFL. FOR A PITTSBURGH TEAM THAT WANTS TO ESTABLISH THE RUN, IT WILL BE A TOUGH THING TO DO AGAINST THE PATRIOTS. AL: OVERALL, THEIR RUSHING DEFENSE, FOURTH IN THE LEAGUE. KIRK JUST MENTIONED A VERY LOW AVERAGE AGAIN. THEY RELY ON THE FRONT AND THE LINEBACKERS. IT IS SECOND DOWN AND 9. THEY WILL GET TO THE 50 YARD LINE. THAT WAS NAJEE HARRIS AGAIN. IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND LET'S CALL IT 6. KIRK: THE DEFENSIVE LINEMEN, ALLOWING THE LINEBACKERS TO GET DOWNHILL. THIS IS WHAT NEW ENGLAND WANTS TO DO. LET' LET'S PUT TRUBISKY IN THESE THIRD-AND-OBVIOUS SITUATIONS AND THEN BILL BELICHICK AND THE DEFENSIVE STAFF CAN GIVE THE LOOKS THEY WANT TO TO CONFUSE TRUBISKY TO SEE IF HE WILL THROW IT INTO COVERAGE. AL: JALEN MOORING COMING IN FOR A THIRD DOWN AND 6 -- JAYLEN WARREN COMING IN FOR A THIRD DOWN AND 6. TRUBISKY FIRES AND INTERCEPTED! J.C. JACKSON. A FLAG IS DOWN. JACKSON LEFT, WENT TO THE CHARGERS. TRUBISKY SAID IT WILL BE A HOLD ON NEW ENGLAND AND THAT APPEARS TO BE THE HOLD. REFEREE: PASS INTERFERENCE, DEFENSE, NUMBER 29. THIS IS A SPOT FOUL AND AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. KIRK: IT IS HOW HE CAUGHT UP AND WAS ABLE TO MAKE THE INTERCEPTION. PICKENS WAS GETTING AWAY FROM HIM AND HE TRIED TO PULL A VETERAN MOVE AND SEE IF HE COULD GET AWAY WITH IT. RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. NICE JOB OF CROSSING OVER. MAKING THE DEFENSE HAVE TO COMMUNICATE. RIGHT THERE, HE GRABS ON. REFEREE: THE BALL HAS BEEN MOVED TO THE 39 YARD LINE. AL: THAT IS AN 11 YARD PENALTY. FIRST FLAG OF THE NIGHT. COMING OFF LAST WEEK, THAT IS A TREAT, SIX MINUTES INTO THE TRUBISKY, CAN' TRUBISKY, CAN'T AND THEN SPUN OUT OF BOUNDS IS GEORGE PICKENS. JONATHAN JONES COVERING ON THE KIRK: THIS IS THE THIRD GAME THEY MADE THIS MOVE WITH MATT CANADA BEING LET GO IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR. EDDIE FAULKNER TAKES OVER AS THE INTERIM OC. ON THE LEFT IS THE PLAY CALLER. HE CALLED PLAYS WITH THE NEW YORK GIANTS. THAT EXPERIENCE PUTS HIM IN THE MIDDLE TO TRY TO RUN A CLEAN OPERATION. AL: ROBINSON SETS UP ON THE RIGHT SIDE. TOSS. WARREN. NOTHING. JENNINGS IS RIGHT THERE TO STOP HIM IN HIS TRACKS. KIRK: WITH JUDON GOING DOWN, JENNINGS WENT FROM BEING A ROLE PLAYER TO A FEATURE PLAYER. LOOK AT HOW HE USES HIS HANDS AND THROWS HIM. JENNINGS IS A GUY WHO SETS THE EDGE AND HE CAN PROVIDE SOME PASS RUSH. HE IS EXCELLING IN HIS FOURTH YEAR OUT OF ALABAMA. AL: JUDON IS PROBABLY THEIR BEST DEFENSIVE PLAYER, TORN BICEPS, GONE FOR THE SEASON. LOW SNAP, HANDLES IT. HE WILL TAKE OFF AND GO NOWHERE. STOPPED AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. TACKLE MADE BY MACK WILSON SR.. KIRK: REMEMBER THE FIRST PLAY OF THE GAME, HE STEPPED UP AND PICKED UP YARDS. THIS TIME, MACK WILSON ALMOST ANTICIPATING THE POTENTIAL THREAT. EVEN THOUGH HE RUSHED OFF THE EDGE, TO ME, HE IS ALMOST USED AS A SPY. NOW I WILL GET UNDERNEATH. ALMOST BAITED HIM TO STEP UP. AL: THAT MEANS CHRIS BOSWELL, NINTH YEAR WITH THE STEELERS, SIGNED AS A FREE AGENT OUT OF RICE IN 2015. 56 YARD ATTEMPT AND BOSWELL BANGS THAT ONE THROUGH. AL: T.J. WATT, A ROUGH OPENING SALVO. KIRK: FIRST PLAY OF THE GAME, LOOK AT THAT, KNEE TO THE FACE. THAT IS A LOT OF IMPACT THAT HE ENDURES. AND THEN HE TAKES A HEEL FROM ZEKE ELLIOTT IN THE FACE. A ROUGH FIRST DRIVE. NOT ONLY 7 POINTS, BUT YOUR STAR PLAYER GETS SOME SHOTS. AL: MILESTONE NIGHT FOR HIM, PLAYING IN HIS 100TH GAME. T.J. WATT THROUGH 100 GAMES, MIKE TOMLIN CALLING HIM THE BEST DEFENSIVE PLAYER ON THE PLANET. 91.5 SACKS, RECOVERED 10 FUMBLES, SEVEN PICKS AND HE IS IN A GROUP OF ONLY THREE, JARED ALLEN AND HIS BROTHER. KIRK: SINCE HIS DAYS AT WISCONSIN, THE PASSION AND ENERGY HE PLAYS WITH EVERY SINGLE DOWN, EVERY SINGLE WEEK. AL: ZAPPE RETREATS. ZAPPE THROWS DOWNFIELD INTO DOUBLE COVERAGE AND THAT IS INCOMPLETE, INTENDED FOR TYQUAN THORNTON. KAYLEE: WHILE PITTSBURGH'S DEFENSE WAS ON THE SIDELINES, T.J. WATT WAS ATTENDED TO. A DOCTOR ACTUALLY REACHED INSIDE HIS MOUTH AND EVALUATED THAT JAW JOINT. NO OTHER ATTENTION WAS PAID TO HIM AFTER THAT. AL: YOU COULD SEE HIM GOING THROUGH THAT RIGHT THERE ON THE BENCH. NUMBER 90. RAIN, SNOW, NOTHING WILL KEEP HIM FROM HIS APPOINTED ROUNDS. SPEAKING OF THE WEATHER, IT IS 45 DEGREES. VERY NICE. UP THE MIDDLE, ZEKE ELLIOTT PICKS UP 3. THIRD DOWN AND 7. KIRK: T.J. WATT HAS BEEN CHALLENGED THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER. I LOVE THAT HE IS ABLE TO DEFEND THE RUN. HE IS NOT JUST ABOUT BEING A PASS RUSHER. I THINK HE TAKES A LOT OF PRIDE IN BEING A COMPLETE PLAYER. HE WORKS AT HIS GAME 12 MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR. WE ALL GET EXCITED FOR THESE OPPORTUNITIES ON THIRD DOWN. IF YOU STUDY HIM, IT IS IN EVERYTHING DOWN THING FOR NUMBER 90. AL: SIX MINUTES LEFT IN THE OPENING QUARTER. ZAPPE, DOWNFIELD, IT WILL BE CAUGHT OUTSIDE THE 40 YARD LINE AND THEN A FLAG COMES IN AT THE END OF THE PLAY. HUNTER HENRY, THE TIGHT END. THE STEELERS INDICATING IT IS AGAINST THE PATRIOTS. OFFENSE, NUMBER 85. 10 YARD PENALTY FROM THE PREVIOUS SPOT, THIRD DOWN. AL: THAT IS HOW HUNTER GOT FREE. KIRK: AT THE TOP OF THE ROUTE, HE PUSHED OFF. I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT ZAPPE SITTING IN THERE ON A THIRD AND LONG. THE PUSH IS RIGHT THERE. GOOD CALL BY THE OFFICIAL. THAT IS HOW SEPARATING AND GETTING OPEN. AL: THIRD DOWN AND 17. BELICHICK ARGUING THE CALL. THEY HAVE TO GET TO THE 35. THROWS UNDERNEATH. ELLIOTT HAS A BLOCKER AND THE DEFENSE CLOSES QUICKLY ON HIM. MINKAH FITZPATRICK IS THERE AND THE PATRIOTS SCENTED IN THE PUNT UNIT. KIRK: IF YOU ARE A PATRIOTS FAN, THAT IS WHAT HAS BOTHERED YOU THE MOST, THE MISCUES. THE RED ZONE HAS BEEN A PROBLEM AND TURNOVERS. INTERCEPTIONS AND PENALTIES THAT GET YOU BEHIND THE STICKS. AL: BRYCE BERINGER, A ROOKIE OUT OF MICHIGAN STATE IS THE PUNTER. CALVIN AUSTIN BACK TO ACCEPT IT AT HIS 25 YARD LINE. BACKING UP A LITTLE BIT. CATCHES THE BALL AT THE 17. NOWHERE TO ROAM. STOP AT THE 21 YARD T.J. WATT JU BLUE MEDICAL TENT. WE WILL GET A REPORT ON THAT. MEANWHILE, IN TERMS OF INJURIES, THERE IS KENNY PICKETT. HE IS OUT FOR TWO TO FOUR WEEKS. THE STEELERS HAVE A QUESTION THEY NEED TO BE ANSWERED. IS HE THE FUTURE? HE HAD ANKLE SURGERY THIS WEEK. WE WILL GET WORD ON THAT WHEN WE COME BACK. IS HE THE GUY FOR THE FUTURE? WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED. TRUBISKY BACK TO PASS, THROWS AND IS DROPPED AT THE 26 YARD KAYLEE: LESS THAN 24 HOURS AFTER PICKETT LIMPED OFF THE FIELD WITH A SPRAINED RIGHT ANKLE, HE WAS IN SURGERY ON MONDAY. HOLES ARE DRILLED INTO THE TWO BONES OF THE LOWER LEG AND SUTURES PULLED THE BONES TOGETHER AND STABILIZE THE INJURED LOWER SHIN. PICKETT HAD THE SAME PROCEDURE DONE ON HIS LEFT ANKLE IN COLLEGE AND HE RETURNED TO PLAY 26 DAYS LATER. AL: THANK YOU, DR. HARTUNG. YOU ARE GETTING VERY GOOD AT THOSE ANIMATIONS. SECOND DOWN AND 10. HERE IS HARRIS. THEY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF HE IS THE GUY FOR THE FUTURE. THEY PICKED HIM IN THE FIRST ROUND LAST YEAR. OFF AND ON THIS YEAR, NOTHING GREAT. LOOKING AHEAD TO NEXT YEAR, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? KIRK: THAT IS THE BIG DECISION THEY WILL HAVE TO MAKE. SECOND YEAR OUT OF PITT. MATT CANADA TOOK A LOTTO BLAME FOR THE OFFENSIVE STRUGGLES. CAN PICKETT BE THE GUY? YOU LOOK AT THE RECEIVERS, THE TIGHT END, THE RUNNING BACKS, ALL YOU NEED IS CONSISTENCY FROM THE QUARTERBACK POSITION AND THIS OFFENSE COULD BE UP TO THE LEVEL YOU EXPECTED TO BE. AL: THIRD AND 6. TRUBISKY GOING DEEP DOWNFIELD AND TOO DEEP. INTENDED FOR ALLEN ROBINSON. QUICKLY, THREE AND OUT. KIRK: THAT IS WHAT THEY WILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IN THE IS KENNY PICKETT THE GUY WHO CAN GIVE YOU THE CONSISTENCY THAT THIS OFFENSE NEEDS? ONLY THEY KNOW THAT DECISION. AL: WHEN YOU FLIP IT AROUND, WITH NEW ENGLAND, IT IS ALMOST THE SAME THING WITH MAC JONES, EVEN THOUGH JONES HAS BEEN IN THE LEAGUE A YEAR LONGER. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THEIR FUTURE AT QUARTERBACK? KIRK: THAT IS A BIG ONE. I DO NOT THINK THEY HAVE THE WEAPONS AROUND THAT POSITION LIKE THIS FOR DOES. AL: FAIR CATCH MADE BY MYLES BRYANT, OFF THE FOOT OF PRESSLEY HARVIN. A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT ZAPPE. HE WAS A NOTHING, NO-STAR RECRUIT. ATTENDED HOUSTON BAPTIST UNIVERSITY FOR THREE YEARS AND THEN TRANSFERRED TO WESTERN KENTUCKY WITH ONE OF HIS COACHES AND SET THE ALL-TIME SINGLE SEASON YARDAGE IN -- ALL-TIME SINGLE SEASON PASSING YARDAGE RECORD. MAKING HIS FOURTH CAREER START TONIGHT. KIRK: HE HAS NO PROBLEM BEING ABLE TO EVALUATE COVERAGE, MAKE THROWS. I THINK IT IS MORE ABOUT BEING DECISIVE TONIGHT. QUARTERBACKS WHO HAVE HAD A LOT OF GAMES UNDER THEIR BELT, IT IS A LOT EASY TO PROCESS THE INFORMATION. WITH A YOUNG GUY LIKE THIS, THEY ARE TRYING TO SIMPLIFY IT AND GET IT OUT QUICK. AL: A CATCH IS MADE BY TYQUAN THORNTON, SECOND YEAR RECEIVER OUT OF BAYLOR. KIRK: I THINK WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO, BILL O'BRIEN TRYING TO GO BACK TO THAT FIRST POSSESSION WHERE THEY JUST WENT DOWN THE FIELD. A LOT OF THROWS WERE ON EARLY DOWNS. THEY GOT HIM INTO A RHYTHM. THAT WAS THEIR FIRST TOUCHDOWN ON AN OPENING DRIVE OF THE ENTIRE SEASON AND THEY EXECUTED PERFECTLY. AL: WATT OUT OF THE TENT, LOOKING LIKE HE IS READY TO COME BACK IN. FIRST DOWN AT THE 38 YARD LINE. PLAY-ACTION. ESCAPES THE SACK, FIRES AND THAT WILL BE HAULED IN AT THE 46 YARD LINE BY JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER. ALEX HIGHSMITH WITH THE PRESSURE ON ZAPPE, WHO IS ABLE TO GET AWAY AND FIND HIS MEN. KIRK: HERE IS HIGHSMITH AND HERE IS CONNOR MCDERMOTT. LOOK AT HIM CLIMB. HE FELT THE PRESSURE. THAT IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. ABILITY TO KEEP HIS VISION DOWNFIELD DESPITE ALL THE NOISE AROUND HIM. THAT IS THE EXPERIENCE AND WHAT HE SHOWED AT WESTERN KENTUCKY FOR THAT ONE YEAR, THE ABILITY TO THROW THE BALL DOWNFIELD. WATT OUT, HIGHSMITH APPLIES THE PRESSURE AND CONNOR MCDERMOTT DOES JUST ENOUGH TO ALLOW HIM TO STEP UP. AL: MEANWHILE, ZAPPE, MOVING OUT OF BOUNDS. ELLIOTT WAS THE INTENDED RECEIVER BUT JUST THROWING IT AWAY TO AVOID THE SACK. AL: DOESN'T THIS GAME FEEL LIKE WITH THESE QUARTERBACKS -- IT IS ONE THING TO BE EFFICIENT, WHICH GUY WILL AVOID THAT CRITICAL ERROR? A PICK SIX OR A SACK AND FUMBLE? IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT BEING EFFICIENT. JUST AVOID THE PLAY THAT COSTS YOU THE GAME. AL: TRUBISKY HAS SPENT HIS ENTIRE CAREER AVOIDING A PICK SIX. WATT IS BACK IN. THAT PASS IS INCOMPLETE. A LITTLE BIT BEHIND JALEN REGULAR, FORMER NUMBER 1 PICK BY PHILADELPHIA. KIRK: TOM BRADY DID THIS A MILLION TIMES. FORGET ABOUT IT, IT IS A NICE COMPLETION. JUST MISSING THAT BY SIX INCHES BEHIND THE RECEIVER IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CATCH AND YARDS AFTER THE CATCH AND INCOMPLETION AND NOW THIRD 10. AL: 2:20 TO GO IN THE QUARTER. PAST SCORED -- PATS SCORED ON THEIR OPENING DRIVE AND LEAD 7-3. THAT IS INCOMPLETE. INTENDED FOR SMITH-SCHUSTER. YOU HAD JOEY PORTER JR., THE ROOKIE, COVERING ON THE PLAY, OUT OF PENN STATE. FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: I REALLY THOUGHT HE WAS THROWING THE BALL TO HENRY, 85. HE GETS AWAY WITH A POTENTIAL PUSH OFF AT THE TOP OF HIS ROUTE. I REALLY THOUGHT THEY WOULD THROW TO HIM. WATCH HENRY PUSH OFF. THE BALL GOES OVER HIS HEAD AND IS ALMOST INTERCEPTED. AL: COULD HAVE CALLED HENRY AGAIN, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS SECOND OFFENSIVE P.I. THE PUNT FIELDED AT THE TENT AND RUN BACK TO THE 15 YARD LINE BY CALVIN AUSTIN. ACRISURE STADIUM, PITTSBURGH, PA, 7 SO, AS WE COME BACK TO PITTSBURGH, WE WILL HEAD WEST TO VEGAS AS THE RAIDERS MEET CHARGERS ON THURSDAY NIGHT BOTH TEAMS TRYING TO STAY ALIVE. THE CHARGERS COMING OFF A SHOT OUT WIN AT NEW ENGLAND. THE RAIDERS ARE ALSO 5-7. KIRK: EVERY SINGLE GAME COMING DOWN THE STRETCH WITH THE PLAYOFF PICTURE, YOU LOOK AT ALL THE TEAMS THAT ARE MATHEMATICALLY ALIVE. EVERY GAME MATTERS. THAT WILL BE A GOOD ONE NEXT WEEK. AL: TRUBISKY OUT OF THE PISTOL. TOSS HERE. HARRIS. NAJEE PICKS UP 4, GETS TO THE 19 JENNINGS MAKING THE TACKLE. KIRK: THIS DEFENSE HAS DONE IT ALL YEAR. WHAT IS CRAZY, 1-3, ALLOWING 10 OR FEWER POINTS. THE REST OF THE ENTIRE NFL IS 53-0 WHEN THEY ALLOW 10 POINTS OR FEWER. THIS PATRIOTS DEFENSE, 1-3. AL: TRUBISKY. SECONDHAND 6 -- SECOND AND 6. PICKING UP THE FIRST DOWN, JAYLEN WARREN. THE CROWD LIKES IT. THEY HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH JAYLEN WARREN OUT OF OKLAHOMA STATE, UNDRAFTED FREE AGENT. KIRK: HE WAS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE ENTIRE DEFENDERS MISS. AL: WARREN STAYS IN. HE IS THE MOTION MAN. NAJEE CAN BARELY GET OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. JALEN MILLS MAKING THE TACKLE. KIRK: PATRIOTS JUST KEEP FILING GUYS IN -- SAFETIES, INTERCHANGEABLE PARTS THAT CAN DO SO MANY PARTS OF THIS DEFENSE. PAMPERS, SOMETIMES -- PEPPERS, SOMETIMES HE IS A SAFETY, SOMETIMES A LINEBACKER. THESE PLAYERS CAN DO SO MANY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS DEFENSE. AL: IT HAS BEEN A BELICHICK TRADEMARK FOR A QUARTER CENTURY. KEEP THEM GUESSING. SECOND AND 11. THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE END OF THE QUARTER. WE HAVEAL: AL MICHAELS WITH KIRK HERBSTREIT, KAYLEE HARTUNG. THERE IS BILL BELICHICK COACHING UP THE OFFENSE, ZAPPE AND CHECKING OUT THE SCREEN. RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE ON DEFENSE AS WE ENTER THE SECOND FRAME. PITTSBURGH WITH A THIRD DOWN AND 10 AT THEIR OWN 27 YARD LINE. THEY WILL GO FIVE WIDE. NOW WARREN COMES INTO THE TRUBISKY, UNDER PRESSURE, FIRES, IT IS INTERCEPTED INSIDE THE 40! JABRILL PEPPERS, DOWN THE SIDELINE. THAT WILL SET UP A FIRST DOWN AT THE 11 YARD LINE. THE BOOS RAIN DOWN. KIRK: THIS IS TEXTBOOK FOR WHAT NEW ENGLAND'S PLAN WAS AGAINST TRUBISKY. SHOW HIM A PRE-SNAP LOOK. WATCH ALL THE MOVEMENT FROM THE TIME THE BALL IS SNAPPED. DUGGAR ANN'S UPCOMING ON THE BLITZ. NOW THE LINEBACKERS DROP IN COVERAGE. PEPPERS BAITED HIM, THE ENTIRE DEFENSE, STEVE BELICHICK DIALS IT UP PERFECTLY. THEY BRING PRESSURE FROM HIS RIGHT AND DRAW FROM THE LEFT. THAT HAS BEEN HIS ACHILLES' HEEL, IDENTIFYING THAT AND AVOIDING THE DISASTROUS PLAY. AL: THE PATS AT THE 11 YARD A CHANCE TO EXTEND THEIR LEAD. WE ALMOST GAVE TRUBISKY -- I MENTIONED HE HAD NEVER THROWN A PICK SIX IN 1819 CAREER PASSES. AT LEAST PEPPERS GOT TACKLED AT THE 11 YARD LINE TO SAVE HIM. KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE HIGHSMITH IS DOWN. WE SAW WATT DEALING WITH SOME INJURIES AND HE CAME BACK. ON THE OTHER SIDE IS ALEX HIGHSMITH. KEEP IN MIND, MARKUS GOLDEN IS NOT UP TONIGHT. YOU HAVE NATE HERBIG BEHIND EACH OF THESE OUTSIDE LINEBACKERS. AL: MIKE TOMLIN COMING OUT TO TAKE A FIRSTHAND LOOK. AND AN INJURY TIMEOUT. RUDOLPH." THEY KNOW HIM. HE HAS HAD DECENT MOMENTS. SIXTH YEAR. THEY ARE ABOUT READY TO SEE HIM COME IN AGAIN, BUT NOT AT THE MOMENT. SECOND DOWN AND 7. PATRIOTS, TO THE END ZONE, TOUCHDOWN BY HUNTER HENRY! SO THE PATRIOTS BLANKED LAST WEEK, BLINKED TWICE AT HOME THIS YEAR, LIVING IN SINGLE DIGIT THEY PUT UP A COUPLE OF TOUCHDOWNS TONIGHT. KIRK: VERY DIFFERENT LOOKING OFFENSE TONIGHT. MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE. DAILY, -- BAILEY ZAPPE HUGE. THE INTERCEPTION TO HIM UP. WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE MYKAL WALKER ENDS UP SLIPPING AT THE TOP OF THE ROUTES, AND THEY THREW RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS DEFENSE. THAT IS WHERE YOU THOUGHT THEY WOULD ATTACK AGAINST THESE LINEBACKERS BETWEEN THE SAFETIES, AND THEY HIT ONE FOR A AL: RYLAND FOR THE POINT AFTER. AND SECONDS INTO THE SECOND QUARTER, THE PATRIOTS, TWO AND 10, LEAD THE STEELERS 7-5, 14-3. KIRK: HENRY WAS CLOSE TO MAKING SOME BIG PLAYS, CAPITALIZES ON THE RED ZONE. LET'S LOOK AT THIS DEFENSIVE ALERT AMAZON LIKES TO LOOK AT. THE RED SHOWS YOU THE POTENTIAL PEPPERS IS AT THE TOP. SNAP OF THE BALL. YOU SEE THE MOVEMENT. THEY WANTED TO SEE IT FROM THE PRE-SNAP, WHERE HE THINGS HE HAS AN IDEA WHERE TO GO TO THE BALL, AND THEN YOU MOVE AND IT AFFECTS HIS VISION. PEPPERS IS THE BENEFICIARY. GETS THE BALL BACK TO BAILEY ZAPPE HE AND A BIG TOUCHDOWN THROW UP HIGH IN THE AIR WHERE THE TIGHT ENDS COME DOWN WITH IT. ZAPPE IS OFTEN A GREAT START WITH THIS PATRIOTS OFFENSE. AL: WE WERE TALKING ON THE CALL THE OTHER DAY, WE SAID, WHO WAS YOUR SUPPORT SYSTEM? IT IS TOUGH, YOU ARE IN A NEW ENGLAND AND ALL OF THAT, AND HIS FIANCEE, AND DO YOU AT LEAST LOVE YOUR JOB? YEAH. KIRK: SHE IS NOT PATTING HIM ON THE BACK BUT SAYING, DO YOUR JOB. AL: THE BELICHICK MANTRA. ALMOST ALL OF HIS CARRIER. KIRK: SHE WAS AN ATHLETE HERSELF, SO YOU CANNOT CRY ON HER SHOULDER. AL: THE PATRIOTS HAVE SCORED 13 TOTAL POINTS THEIR LAST THREE GAMES. THEY HAVE EXCEEDED THAT TONIGHT WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN 15 MINUTES. INJURY REPORT. KAYLEE: WE HAVE SEEN BOTH OF THE STEELERS OUTSIDE LINEBACKERS INTO THE BLUE TENT TONIGHT. ALEX HIGHSMITH IS STILL THERE. HE IS QUESTIONABLE TO RETURN BECAUSE MY NECK INJURY. THE UNAFFILIATED NEUROTRAUMA CONSULTANT IS INSIDE THE TENT WITH HIM NOW. EARLIER, WE SAW T.J. WATT IN THERE FOR FOUR MINUTES, BUT HE HAS BEEN BACK IN THE GAME, AND HIS HELMET NOW HAS A TINTED VISOR ATTACHED TO IT. AL: HE WAS ON THE BENCH. MEANWHILE, THEY START FROM THE 25 YARD LINE. TWO RISKY WITH A LITTLE TOSS -- TRUBISKY WITH A LITTLE TOSS YEAR. FIVE YARD LOSS. JENNINGS MAKES THE TACKLE. AND THE CROWD IS NOT HAPPY. KIRK: THAT IS A MISMATCH ON THE EDGE. WE TALKED ABOUT JENNINGS AND HOW PHYSICAL HE IS. WATCH THE TIGHT END ACROSS FROM HIM, DARNELL WASHINGTON. HE GOES OUTSIDE, AND THEN JENNINGS SHOOTS INSIDE. JUST HAS NO CHANCE, SO IT IS A MISCOMMUNICATION ON THE EDGE BETWEEN THE TITANS. MY GUESS IS WASHINGTON ENDS UP NEEDING TO COME DOWN TO KEEP HIM AWAY FROM THAT PENETRATION. AL: TRUBISKY THROWS. CAUGHT. SIGNALED HIM. WILSON MAKES THE STOP, THIRD DOWN AND 8. KIRK: THIS PLAYS INTO NEW ENGLAND'S HANDS. THE STEELERS ARE 0-3 THEY KEEP THEM IN THIS THIRD AND 8. LAST TIME THEY SHOW THEY WILL LOOK IN THE PRE-SNAP. MOVED, THROWS THE INTERCEPTION. AT SEA WITH A DIAL-UP HERE AT THIS THIRD DOWN AND LONG. AL: STEELERS HAVE BROUGHT 16 PLAYS FROM 38 YARDS. AT THIRD AND 8, TRUBISKY THROWS, AND THAT IS ALMOST HIT. THAT WILL BRING A TORRENT OF BOO'S. ALEX AUSTIN IS THERE. YOU SAW IN THE THREE-QUARTER -- YOU SAW TRUBISKY, MASON RUDOLPH, AND, BY THE WAY, BEN ROETHLISBERGER IS IN THE BUILDING. KIRK: WE SAID HELLO TO HIM EARLIER. THIS IS A ROOKIE OUT ON AN ISLAND ON THIRD DOWN. THE BALL IS LATE IN BEHIND HIM. AL: HERE COMES THE CHANT AGAIN. HERE IS HARVEY'S KICK. 29 YARD LINE BY MYLESAL: TALKING DAY ABOUT DRAFTED, GETS PICKED IN THE FOURTH ROUND, BUT HIS FRIENDS WERE RANK FALLING HIM, AND NOW OF A SUDDEN, HE GETS ANOTHER CALL, ASK THE PHONE UP, AND THEY SAY, SCOUT FROM THE PATRIOTS -- PICKS THE PHONE UP, ELLIOTT PULLS THAT. HE GETS THE CALL FROM THE SCOUT, THE SCOUT SAYS, HERE IS BILL BELICHICK. BILL BELICHICK SAYS, HEY, HERE, WE ARE DRAFTING YOU NEXT. KIRK: SO MUCH FOR WELCOME TO THE BALL CLUB. AL: HERE YOU GO, YOU ARE NEXT. KIRK: BUT HE DID THINK, WHAT IS GOING ON? IS ONE OF MY FRIENDS PRINTING ME? I AM SURE AFTER BELICHICK HOPPED ON, HE KNEW. NOBODY IS DOING THIS. AL: RIGHT. KIRK: WITH THE STEELERS OFFENSE PLAYING THE WAY IT IS, IT IS TIME FOR THE STEELERS DEFENSE TO ASSERT THEMSELVES AND MAKE SOME PLAYS. GET THIS GUY BEHIND THE STICKS. AL: ZAPPE THROWS. DROPPED UP AT THE 30 YARD LINE. ZEKE ELLIOTT IS A BUSY MAN TONIGHT, HE CARRIED SIX TIMES FOR NINE YARDS AND SCORED THREE FOR 32, THIRD AND 11. KIRK: WE HAVE SEEN ALL THESE BACKUP QUARTERBACKS. JAKE BROWNING HAD A BIG GAME FOR CINCINNATI. GARDNER MINSHEW FROM INDIANAPOLIS. ZAPPE OFF TO A GOOD START. THAT IS A BIG THEME THIS YEAR AND NFL, THESE HIGH-PROFILE QUARTERBACKS GOING DOWN, AND A LOT OF TIMES, THAT BACKUP IS NOT READY TO ANSWER BUT ZAPPE TONIGHT IS DOING THAT. AL: THIRD AND 11. SHOULDERS SHAKE. OUT HERE TO ELLIOTT. ZEKE LOOKING FOR THAT FIRST. COMES UP SHORT THREE YARDS IN FRONT OF THE STEELERS BENCH. KIRK: I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM AT ALL. THAT IS A GREAT PLAY BY BAILEY HE WENT THROUGH THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT PROGRESSIONS. EVERYBODY IS COVERED. THEY PLAYED THE ZONE. INSTEAD OF FORCING THE BALL, THAT HAS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH MAC JONES. THEY TRY TO MAKE A PLAY AND IT ENDS UP BEING A TURNOVER ON THIRD DOWN. HE JUST TEXTED DOWN AND ALMOST GAVE ZEKE A CHANCE TO PICK UP THAT FIRST DOWN. HE PUNTED AWAY, NO PROBLEM. AL: BRYCE BERINGER'S THIRD PUNT OF THE NIGHT. THAT ONE WILL SKID INTO THE END ZONE. KIRK: TIME FOR THE HIGH-PERFORMANCE 4K SKYCAM PRESENTED BY BMW. THIS PATRIOTS DEFENSE HAS BEEN DOING A LOT OF DAMAGE IN THE EARLY PART OF THE GAME, WHETHER IT IS DEFENDING A RUN -- YEARS JENNINGS AGAINST JAYLEN WARREN. PEPPER IS DISGUISING A PART OF THAT DEFENSE AND THEN RECOGNIZING THE BALL IN THE AIR AND CAPITALIZES. STEPS IN FRONT OF IT. GETS HIS OWN OFFENSE. REALLY GOOD FIELD POSITION. THEY WERE ABLE TO PUT ANOTHER TOUCHDOWN ON THE BOARD. THIS LOOKS LIKE A DIFFERENT TEAM THAN 15 THAT HAS PLAYED ALL YEAR AND THE TEAM THAT PLAYED LAST WEEK, WHEN THEY DID NOT GET ANYTHING ON THE BOARD. AL: THE LAST THREE WEEKS. SINGLE DIGITS EACH WEEK, ALREADY 14 ON THE BOARD TONIGHT. FROM THE 20 YARD LINE, JAYLEN TRUBISKY ROLLING. KEEPING. DOWN HE GOES AFTER A GAIN OF THREE. KIRK: I THINK WE CAME IN TONIGHT KNOWING THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE TOUGH ON TRUBISKY, BUT, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT JAYLEN WARREN AND NAJI HARRIS HAVE BEEN A NON-FACTOR SO FAR IN RUNNING THE FOOTBALL. HARRIS HAS SIX YARDS ON SIX CARRIES. WARREN NEGATIVE TWO YARDS. IT IS OBVIOUSLY EASY TO POINT TO TRUBISKY AND HIS PASSING GAME, BUT THEY NEED MORE FROM THIS OFFENSE OF LINE AND THIS RUNNING GAME TO TAKE SOME OF THE PRESSURE OFF OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING THROWING THE BALL BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THEY ARE OUT OF RHYTHM IN A BIG WAY. AL: THE TOUCHDOWN THAT PUT HENRY INTO THE TENT ON THE NEW ENGLAND SIDE, SECOND DOWN AND CENTER. FLAG. TWO YARD GAIN HERE FOR WARREN. CLAY MARTIN TO GIVE US THE CALL. KIRK: IF I WERE MIKE, ILLEGAL FORMATION AT WEEK 14 OR WHATEVER ONE WE ARE IN RIGHT NOW, THAT WOULD DRIVE ME CRAZY. FIVE MEN IN THE BACKFIELD. AL: GOT TO HAVE AT LEAST SEVEN UPFRONT. LOOKING OVER TO BELICHICK TO SEE WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. REFEREE: FORMATION ON OFFENSE, NUMBER 76, ELIGIBLE RECEIVER BUT DID NOT COVER THE TACKLE. PENALTY IS DECLINED. AL: TAKE THE PLAY. HE IS EXORCISED. KIRK: YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES BUT YOU CANNOT MAKE MENTAL ONES. AGAIN, THEY END UP DECLINING IT. IT GETS TO ANOTHER THIRD DOWN. THEY HAVE NOT CONVERTED YET ON THIRD DOWN TONIGHT. AL: THIRD AND 5. RUSHED FOR. TRUBISKY THROWS. OUT OF BOUNDS FOR DYONTAE JOHNSON. HIS FIRST TARGET OF THE NIGHT. THEB THE BOO' THE BOO'S ARE DOWN THERE. FOR EVERY PLAY. KIRK: LOW PERCENTAGE THROW ONE THIRD DOWN AND MEDIUM.INSTEAD OF TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING , A TIGHT END OR OUT IN THE BACKFIELD OR A MATCHUP WITH A CROSSER, THEY GO FOR A HEAVE HO DOWNFIELD, NO SHOT. AL: MARVIN. SHORT TIP. TAKES IT BOUNCING. MORE BOO'S RAIN DOWN. WHERE A START FOR THE STEELERS 9:48 LEFT INMIKE TOMLIN TALKED ABOUT WHEN THEY PLAYED JV FOOTBALL LAST WEEK AGAINST THE CARDINALS WHO WERE TWO AND 10, AND THEY ARE RIGHT IN THE OF THINGS. THIS IS A MUST -- RIGHT IN THE THICK OF THINGS, AND THIS IS A MUST WIN GAME. AL: PRETTY TERRIBLE THUS FAR. HERE IS ELLIOTT. MEANWHILE, THE CROWD FRUSTRATED ABOUT SO MANY THINGS, BUT THEY LOOKED AT THAT SCHEDULE AND SAID, HEY, WE HAVE ARIZONA COMING, NEW ENGLAND, THOSE ARE TWO WINS. THEY ALREADY LOST ARIZONA, AND NOW THEY ARE 11 POINTS DOWN FROM THE OTHER TWO WITH TEAM. KIRK: YOU HAVE GREAT LEADERS. PEOPLE WANTED TO BLAME MATT CANADA, THIS AND THAT. AT SOME POINT, THE LEADERS ON THIS TEAM HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE DIFFERENCE IN THE STEELERS, THE GREAT STEELERS TEAM. THEY LEAD FROM WITHIN. THE LEADERSHIP FROM THE PLAYERS, THEY NEED TO STEP UP RIGHT NOW. SOMEBODY NEEDS TO MAKE PLAYS AND GET SOME FIRE ON THIS TEAM. CAUGHT THREE YARDS SHY OF THE FIRST, TRYING TO PICK UP EXTRA YARDAGE IS BROWN. KIRK: WHAT IS AMAZING, I AM SURE WITH PEOPLE WATCHING, THE PATRIOTS ARE TWO AND 10. TO GET A TEAM TO CONTINUE TO PLAY WITH FIRE AND TO BE INSPIRED AND GIVE YOU SOME WE ARE SHOWING UP AND GOING TO BE ACCOUNTABLE, AS HE SAYS, DO YOUR JOB, YOU ARE SEEING THAT FROM A TEAM THAT IS TWO AND 10. PITTSBURGH IS RIGHT IN THE THICK OF HIS THING WITH THE WILDCARD. THEY ALMOST LOOK DISINTERESTED THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. AL: TOMLIN SAID A HORRIBLE DAY AT THE OFFICE. THIS ONE STARTED OUT THE SAME WAY. THIRD DOWN AND 3. MONTGOMERY IS IN THE GAME. THAT IS CAUGHT ON THE RUN. TAKES IT TO THE 25 YARD LINE. KIRK: THEY CONTINUE TO GO AFTER THESE LINEBACKERS ON THIRD DOWN. AGAIN, THEY HAVE HAD SO MANY INJURIES. YOU SEE THEM SHOWING PRESSURE. THEY DROP HERE, AND THAT OPENS IT UP. WATCH HIS HEAD ON THE SWIVEL. HE WORRIES ABOUT HIS RIGHT. I COULDN' I COULDN'T -- GOOD JOB OF RECOGNIZING THAT BY ZAPPE.HE HAD TWO OPTIONS IN THE MIDDLE LINEBACKER TAKES HIS OPTION TO THE LEFT. THE TIGHT ENDS, NO PROBLEM. GETS THE BALL TO SMITH AT FIRST AL: 28 YARD GAME. HE HAS PICKED UP 82 RECEIVING YARDS TONIGHT. MOST HE HAS HAD IN ANY GAME THIS SEASON. ZAPPE THROWING. CAUGHT, HENRY! TOUCHDOWN! WHOA! SO HENRY WHO SCORED THE PRIOR TOUCHDOWN WENT INTO THE MEDICAL TENT FOR A MOMENT, COMES BACK, AND SCORES AGAIN. KIRK: HOW ABOUT THIS THROW BY THE KID? OH MY GOSH. HE IS PLAYING HATFIELD. USUALLY, YOU CANNOT MAKE THIS THROW WITH THE SAFETY SITTING BACK THERE, BUT HE GIVES IT A LITTLE PUMP FAKE. HE THROWS IT ON THE LINE AND SOMEHOW GETS IT OVER 23. GREAT CONCENTRATION BY THE BIG TIGHT END, BUT YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT THROW IN THE SAFETY A SITTING BACK THERE READY TO JUMP ON I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BUT IT IS A TOUCHDOWN. AL: RIGHT OVER THE HEAD OF KHAZEI. HALFWAY THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER. STUNNINGLY, IF YOU ARE JUST TUNING IN, YES, THERE ARE 24 POINTS ON THE BOARD. KIRK: BAILEY ZAPPE REALLY STEPPED UP TONIGHT. GIVE O'BRIEN A LOT OF CREDIT. DOING A GOOD JOB OF MIXING UP THE PLAY CALL. YOU WOULD THINK THEY WOULD BE CONSERVATIVE AND LET'S BE CAREFUL WITH ZAPPE AGAINST THE PITTSBURGH DEFENSE. NO. THEY GO RIGHT DOWN THE FIELD FOR A TOUCHDOWN. GREAT THROW TO HENRY. THIS SAFETY IS SOMEHOW OVER TO GET IT ON TOP OF HIM. NUMBER FOUR RIGHT NOW IS FEELING IT FOR THE PATRIOTS AND HIS WHERE HAS THIS BEEN ALL YEAR? AL: HE HAS BEEN ON THE BENCH MOST OF THE YEAR. 11 OF 17, 168 YARDS AND THREE TOUCHDOWNS. KIRK: JUST EXECUTION OF IT. HE LOOKS GREAT. YOU CAN JUST TELL HE IS FEELING IT RIGHT NOW. AL: WE MENTIONED IT AT THE START, YOU GET SHUT OUT, STILL GET ANOTHER START. BELICHICK SAYING HE DOES NOT RIDE THE ROLLER COASTER. HE LIKES THAT THE EMOTIONS WERE VERY STEADY. LOOK WHEN HE HAS DONE TONIGHT. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. KIRK: I THOUGHT WHAT JAKE BROWNING DID THE OTHER NIGHT, NO ONE EXPECTED TO SEE THAT IN JACKSONVILLE. NOW HERE WE HAVE ANOTHER EXPERIENCE WITH THE BACKUP QUARTERBACK THAT NOBODY EXPECTED MUCH FROM. HE STEPPED UP IN A BIG WAY FIRST HALF. AL: HAD HIS FIRST START AT TENNESSEE. A TOUCHBACK HERE, WE GO TO KAYLEE. KAYLEE: EACH STEP IN ZAPPE'S CAREER, HE WAS DOUBTED, TOLD HE WAS NOT FAST ENOUGH OR ATHLETIC ENOUGH, BUT HIS COLLEGE COORDINATOR OF FOUR YEARS TOLD ME HE HAS NEVER SEEN ZAPPE'S COMPETENCE WAIVER BECAUSE HE BELIEVES HE CAN OUTWORK ANYBODY. IT WAS A WAKE-UP CALL WHEN HE GOT CUT BY THE PATRIOTS IN CAMP, AND EVEN AS HE SIGNED WITH THEIR PRACTICE SQUAD THE NEXT DAY, HE TOLD HIM, TRUST ME, I GOT THIS. EVENTUALLY, I WILL BE THE STARTER. AL: HE WILL NOT LOSE HIS JOB BEFORE THE END OF THIS GAME. I KNOW THAT. KIRK: THIS COULD NOT HAVE GONE ANY BETTER. AL: PERFECT. MEANWHILE, THE STEELERS, DOWN BY 18. FINALLY THEY GET SOMETHING. JALEN MILLS. KIRK: I JUST LIKE TO SEE ANYTIME YOU CAN GET THE BALL IN SPACE, WHETHER HE IS WRITING IN THE OUTSIDE ZONE, WHERE HE IS ABLE TO FIND THAT OUTSIDE, STRETCH IT, GET UP FIELD ON THIS. YOU HAVE THREE BLOCKERS IN FRONT, THE RECEIVERS DO THEIR JOB, AND HE HAS GREAT QUICKNESS TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT FIELD. NICE, EASY THROW. AL: NAJI HARRIS BACK. HE TAKES AUSTIN GIVES THE CROWD SOMETHING TO CHEER ABOUT AS HE TAKES IT TO THE HATFIELD YARD LINE. NUMBER 73, FIRST HALF. KIRK: TRUBISKY TRYING TO GET INVOLVED, MAYBE TAKE SOME OF HIS FRUSTRATION OUT. TRYING TO OPEN HIS PLAYBOOK. THAT IS WARREN, BY THE WAY, EMOTION, MAYBE TRYING TO DRAW THE DEFENSE'S ATTENTION AND THEN GO BACK THE OTHER WAY. WATCH TRUBISKY, APPRECIATE THE EFFORT.TRYING TO TAKE DOWN PEPPERS BACK TO THAT POSITIVE FIRST DOWN PLEASE YOUR FOR THIS PITTSBURGH OFFENSE. AND YOU COULD KIND OF CALL THIS A DRIVER THEY HAVE TO COME AWAY WITH POINTS YEAR, DOWN 21-3. AL: YEP. 49 YARD LINE. PRESSURE, GETS IT AWAY. TAKING THE BALL IN THE PATRIOT THAT IS CONNOR HEYWARD. PRESSURE THAT TIME PUT ON, BUT HE IS ABLE TO GET IT AWAY BY KYLE DUGGER. KIRK: THE MOST FRUSTRATING PART OF THIS IS NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTROL THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND RUN THE FOOTBALL. THE LAST THREE WEEKS, THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT. IT IS A BIGGER CHALLENGE, AS WE SAID. IT WILL BE TOUGH TO SEE HOW THEY DO AGAINST ONE OF THE BEST RUN DEFENSES IN THE LEAGUE. BUT BY NOT BEING ABLE TO GET THAT RUN GAME GOING, THEY ARE NOT GETTING THE SAFETIES DOWN TO CREATE THE ONE-ON-ONE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PICKENS. AL: SECOND AND 5. FIGHTING HIS WAY ON WHAT SHOULD BE A FIRST DOWN, NAUSEA HARRIS. CONNOR HEYWARD -- KNOWLEDGE A WHEN CONNOR HEYWARD MADE THAT PLAY, THEY ARE GOING TO MARKET A LITTLE BIT SHORT FOR HARRIS. NO-HUDDLE HERE. THIRD AND INCHES. AND A NON-PUSH I CAN PUSH -- AND A NON-PUSH PUSH. KIRK: WE ARE NOT IN PHILLY. AL: UNDER FIVE MINUTES AND UNDERPLAYING THE OPENING HALF. 36 YARDS PLUS THE PICK. HARRIS DOING NEXT TO NOTHING ON THE GROUND. PICKENS HAS SCORED ONE. MOORE INTO THE 35 YARD LINE -- WARREN TO THE 35 YARD LINE. KIRK: ONE OF THE INDICATORS TEAMS HAVE IS STUDYING RECEIVERS AND HOW THEY COME OFF THE LINE ON A RUN VERSUS PASS. HERE IS GEORGE PICKENS ON A RUN THIS LAST PLAY. HE HAS KIND OF TAKEN THE PLAYOFF. I THINK IT SENDS A MESSAGE TO YOUR TEAM. I LOOK AT RECEIVERS, THEIR WILLINGNESS TO BLOCK, AND THE EFFORT THEY'RE WILLING TO PUT FORTH, KIND OF REPRESENTS THE PULSE OF THE TEAM. AL: PERFECT POINT. SECOND DOWN AND 5. THE PASS IS LOW AND INCOMPLETE. TRYING TO GET IT IN THEIR, UNDER THERE BY KYLE DUGGER. AND THE LITTLE CONFERENCE HERE AMONGST FOUR OFFICIALS. NOW DOWN TO THREE. MARTIN. REFEREE: PASS INTERFERENCE. DEFENSE, NUMBER 23. KIRK: I THINK CHOIR MOVES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OFFENSE, JOHNSON ON OUTSIDE, PICKENS WHO CAN STRETCH DEFENSE. IT OPENS UP THE MIDDLE. WE SAW THAT WHEN THEY WENT TO CINCINNATI TWO WEEKS AGO, THEY GOT THE BALL WITH THE SAFETY SPLITTING. IT WORKED DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEAMS. I AM SURE THAT IS SOMETHING THEY WANTED AT SOME POINT TO TRY TO GET TO AGAIN TONIGHT. HE IS A GREAT WEAPON. REMINDS ME OF A LONGER MIKE ANGELA WITH HIS BODY AND VERSATILITY AND WHAT HE CAN DO. AL: WARREN. HE IS STACKED UP AFTER PICKING UP FOUR. BENTLEY THE FIRST GUY TO HIT HIM THERE. HE PICKED UP FOUR FIRST DOWNS ON THIS RUSH. STARTED BACK AT THE 25, MORE THAN FOUR MINUTES. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO GET ON THE BOARD BEFORE THE HALF. KIRK: YOU TALKED ABOUT MIKE TOMLIN FEELING THIS WAS A REDEMPTION WEEK. I THINK THIS IS A REDEMPTION DRIVE DOWN. 21-3 THEY HAVE TO COME AWAY WITH POINTS. GET THEMSELVES TO BELIEVE. THEY GET THE BALL THE SECOND HALF, THEY HAVE TO GET THEMSELVES TO BELIEVE THEY CAN COME BACK IN THIS GAME. AL: HAYWARD AND WATT, THE DEFENSE ON THAT SIDELINE. SECOND DOWN AND 6. HERE COMES THE BLITZ FROM THE OUTSIDE. THE PASS IS GOING TO BE CAUGHT IN THE END ZONE BY JOHNSON! 25 YARDS. DUGGER WAS CLINCHING, PICK THEM UP, GAVE TRUBISKY TIME TO SEND IT TO THE END ZONE FOR THEIR FIRST TOUCHDOWN OF THE NIGHT. KIRK: GOOD JOB BY THE PROTECTION. YOU MENTIONED HARRIS AND TRUBISKY FEELS THIS PRESSURE RIGHT HERE. NAUSEA A HARRIS PICKS IT UP, -- HARRIS KNOWS IT IS THERE, BUT TRUBISKY PICKS IT UP. HE HELPS HARRIS OUT AND THEN PUTS IT OVER THE OUTSIDE SHOULDER OF JOHNSON TO MAKE THAT PLAY OVERTOP OF J.C. JACKSON FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. THEY ANSWER THE CALL. THEY NEEDED THE POINTS, AND THEY GOT THEM. AL: IF YOU LIKE THE OVER, THEY HAVE ALSO ANSWERED THE CALL. CHRIS BOSWELL WITH THE EXTRA POINT. 2:50 TO GO IN THE FIRST HALF. 21-10. NEW ENGLAND. THOUGHT THAT THERE WOULD ONLY BE -- SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT THERE WOULD ONLY BE 30 POINTS IN THIS GAME. NOT AWS. FRIENDLY LOCAL BOOKMAKER. KAYLEE WILL BE NEXT. WE WILL GET A REPORT FROM HER AND A SECOND, AS MONTGOMERY STOPS AT THE 22 YARD LINE. KAYLEE: THOSE OF THE NOMINEES FEATURE TONIGHT, THEY WANT TO POWER THE NEXT GENERATION. JONES WAS INSPIRED BY HIS EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER TO BECOME THE FIRST MALE AMBASSADOR FOR PLAY LIKE A GIRL. HIS NEXT STEP FOUNDATION IMPACTS KIDS IN NEW ENGLAND AND GEORGIA. AND BECAUSE SIX TIME NOMINEE HAYWARD BELIEVES EVERY KID NEED SOMEONE ROOTING FOR THEM, HIS HOUSES FIGHTING CHILDHOOD HUNGER , SPREADING KINDNESS, AMONG OTHER INITIATIVES. AL: 13 GREAT SEASONS IN THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE FOR NUMBER 97. KIRK: WHAT A PLAYER. AL: TREMENDOUS. REFEREE: PERSONAL FOUL. UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS. NUMBER 41. AL: BRENDEN SCHOOLER. KIRK: HE WILL GO AFTER THE WHISTLE. THEY WOULD HAVE HAD THE BALL AT THE 22. AND A LOOK AT THE TIME, 2:46. THE LAWYER QUARTERBACK IS PLAYING, YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT GETTING INTO THE FIELD GOAL RANGE. MAYBE THEY GO BACK TO THEIR 11 YARD. AL: JOE JUDGE, THE SPECIAL TEAM'S COACH, HEAD COACH OF THE GIANTS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. 2:46. EACH TEAM HAS HIS FULL COMPLEMENT OF TIMEOUTS. START FROM THE 11TH. CROWD BACK INTO IT NOW. DECENT HOLD. CLOSES QUICKLY. GAINED A FOUR SECOND DOWN AT KIRK: STEELERS CALLING A TIMEOUT. THEY ARE SENSING IT MAY BE A CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO TRY TO GET THE BALL BACK AND SEE THEY CAN GET FIELD GOAL RANGE THEMSELVES. AL: WEEK 14 BEGINNING TONIGHT, THEY ARE DIVISION LEADERS, AND YOUR WILD-CARD TEAMS OF THE SEASON ENDED RIGHT NOW, STEELERS-BROWNS-COLTS, AND ALMOST EVERYBODY ELSE'S IN THE HUNT. KIRK: LOOK AT GOES TEAMS AT SIX AND SIX. THESE NEXT FOUR TO FIVE WEEKS WILL BE VERY EXCITING. AL: SECOND DOWN AND 6. THAT IS CAUGHT FOR A FIRST DOWN. THIS TY MONTGOMERY MAKES THE GRAB. HE HAS BEEN AROUND NINE YEARS. KIRK: GO AFTER MYKAL WALKER AGAIN IN COVERAGE. ALEXANDER AND ROBERTS, SO THEY HAD TO BRING SOME OTHERS UP. BLAKE MARTINEZ HAD OFFICIALLY RETIRED. THEY ARE BEAT UP AND LINEBACKER. NEW ENGLAND NEW THAT THAT WAS THE POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY, AND THEY HAVE ATTACKED THAT A LOT THIS FIRST HALF. AL: THAT FIRST DOWN ENABLES THEM TO RUN SOME TIME OFF THE CLOCK AFTER NEW ENGLAND HAD USE THEIR FIRST TIMEOUT COMING UP ON THE TWO MINUTE WARNING HERE. ZAPPEZAPPE TO THE OUTSIDE -- ZAPPE TO THE OUTSIDE. A LEAPING GRABBED BY THORNTON. THAT TAKES US TO THE TWO MINUTE WARNING. 21-10, PATRIOTS LEADING THE STEELERS IN PITTSBURGH ON THIS THURSDAY NIGHT. ADORNED STATE FARM HALFTIME CREW. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR WARDROBE BUDGET WAS? KIRK: I CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE IT. I DID NOT KNOW THEY HAD HELP. UNTIL A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AL: NO KIDDING. KIRK: YOU AND I ARE JUST OVER HERE -- AL: WE HAD THE ARMY SURPLUS STORE. THAT PASSES LOW, JUGGLED, INCOMPLETE. THIRD AND 7. KIRK: ONE OF THE FEW MISTAKES WE HAVE SEEN FROM THIS RECEIVER GROUP, WE ARE FOCUSING A LOT ON ZAPPE, BUT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD HIS THEY HAVE HAD INJURIES ON THE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN REAL CONSISTENT AND RECEIVER. TONIGHT, THAT IS A DIFFERENT STORY. THE TIGHT ENDS WITH HUNTER HENRY AND THE RECEIVERS PLAY MUCH BETTER TO GIVE ZAPPE SOME SEPARATION AND CHANCES. AL: THEY WILL GET THE FIRST DOWN HERE. PITTSBURGH IS LOOKING FOR THAT TWO FOR ONE. GET THAT BALL TO SCORE AT THE AND OF THE HALF AND GET IT TO START THE SECOND HALF. ZAPPE THROWS. CAUGHT, AND THAT IS GOING TO BE ENOUGH FOR A FIRST DOWN SO HUNTER HENRY HAVING A BIG NIGHT, TWO TOUCHDOWNS, HIS THIRD CATCH OF THE NIGHT, AND THAT FORCES PITTSBURGH IT'S NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE TIMEOUT. KIRK: THE RIGHT TACKLE, WHO IS REALLY A GUARD, HOLING UP ON AN ISLAND OFTEN AGAINST T.J. WATT, WHICH IS A BIG SURPRISE. ESPECIALLY IN THESE TWO MINUTE WARNING OBVIOUS PASSING SITUATIONS. AL: 31 YARD LINE. LANDON ROBERTS, HAVE NOT CALLED HIS NAME TONIGHT, BUT COMES IN AND MAKES THE SACK. PLAYED IN THREE SUPER BOWLS WITH NEW ENGLAND, AND NOW PITTSBURGH WILL TAKE A TIMEOUT. KIRK: THESE ARE WELL-DESIGNED. ROBERTS WORKS AROUND THAT PICK. NICE JOB OF BEING PATIENT, WORKS AROUND IT, NEW ENGLAND IS NOT COMMUNICATE, AND ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES WE HAVE SEEN ZAPPE WITH SERIOUS PRESSURE. THIS LINE IS GOING TO HAVE A JOB TAKING CARE OF IT. AL: SECOND DOWN AND YOU CAN SEE THAT RIGHT ARM, RIGHT ELBOW, SO HE PLAYED A PRICE THERE, AND WE WILL CHECK IT OUT HERE ON SECOND DOWN AND PLAY. STEELERS HAVE ONE TIMEOUT REMAINING. GOING TO KEEP IT ON THE GROUND. PITTSBURGH USING THAT FINAL TAKES ELLIOTT DOWN. THIRD DOWN AND 21. AL: THIRD AND 21. AND A WHISTLE HERE. NOW YOU HAVE A BLOOD SPOT ON ZAPPE' ZAPPE'S RIGHT ELBOW, SO CLAY MARTIN COMES IN. AND HE IS GOING TO, THOUGHT FOR THE MOMENT TAKE HIM OUT, BUT, HE WILL RESET THE PLAY CLOCK. 25 SECONDS. I AM SURE THAT THEY WILL JUST RUN THE BALL AND RUN THE CLOCK AND TRY TO GO FOR 21 YARDS HERE. KIRK: I THINK THAT IS WHY THEY RAN THE BALL LAST PLAY. AL: BELICHICK IS PRETTY GOOD AT WORKING THE CLOCK. AL: HE HAS ONLY BEEN COACHING 49 YEARS IN THE NHL. STARTED AS A LOW-LEVEL ASSISTANT , BACK IN THE 1970'S IN DETROIT, AND THEN CLEVELAND MOVED TO BALTIMORE BACK IN 1996. INTERESTING TRAIL WITH BILL. WE WILL GET INTO IT IN THE SECOND HALF WITH THE FUTURE ON HOLD FOR HIM. MEANWHILE, THEY WILL RUN THE CLOCK DOWN WITH ALMOST NO TIME AT ALL. AND THEY WILL USE ALL OF THE CLOCK. REFEREE: TIMEOUT TO NEW ENGLAND WAS CALLED PRIOR TO ANY MOVEMENT ON THE LINE, SO 30-SECOND AL: ONE OF THE STORIES, BILL BELICHICK, I MENTIONED, IT IS AN EVERYDAY STORY. WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT THE SECOND HALF. THERE ARE A LOT OF POSSIBILITIES AND ATTENTIVE SPECULATION. KIRK: ANYTIME YOU HAVE A HALL OF FAME CAREER, THE BEST COACH TO EVER COACH, AND A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, THE WAY THEY HAVE, PEOPLE START TO SPECULATE, I THINK HE GETS ASKED ALL THE TIME, IS THIS IT? AND HE SAYS, I PITTSBURGH. AL: ABSOLUTELY, THE LAST MOVE. WITH BILL, IT IS ALWAYS ABOUT NEXT WEEK. IN 2014, THEY LOOK TERRIBLE ON A MONDAY NIGHT GAME IN KANSAS CITY, AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT LOOKS LIKE THE NEW GUY, JIMMY GAROPPOLO, IS ABOUT READY TO TAKE OVER FOR TOM BRADY. SO WE DO THE SUNDAY NIGHT GAME, WE GO TO FOXBORO, ALL THE PAPERS ARE TALKING ABOUT IT IS GARROTTE BELOW'S TIME, BRITT -- JIMMY GAROPPOLO'S TIME, 80'S TIME IS FINISHED IN 2014 -- BRADY' FINISHED IN 2014 -- BRADY'S TIME IS FINISHED IN 2014, AND WHAT HAPPENS AT THE END OF THE YEAR? BRADY WINS THE SUPER BOWL. KIRK: THAT IS OUR I THINK THE AUTOMATIC ASSUMPTION THAT IT IS TIME TO MOVE ON, THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE EASY ANSWER. A LOT OF TIMES, THEY TRY TO DO THAT WITHIN. TOM BRADY IS NOT HERE, SO IT IS A DIFFERENT STORY. AL: REALLY? KIRK: SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT WE WILL GET INTO THAT IN THE AL: I DID NOT REALIZE YOU LEFT. KIRK:. I THINK IT IS PRETTYTWO FABLED COACHES, CERTAI BELICHICK'S SIDE, FIRST BALLOT HALL OF FAMER, UNANIMOUS. HE WILL BE. TOMLIN, 16 YEARS IN THE LEAGUE, THE BOUNCING BALL TAKE INTO THE TWO YARD LINE. TEX IT BACK, BRINGS IT UP TO THE 17 YARD LINE. KIRK: THEY FINALLY FOUND A RHYTHM OFFENSIVELY AT THE END OF THAT FIRST HALF. THEY RAN A SCREEN, THEY GOT A REVERSE WITH THE TRUBISKY BLOCK. THEY JUST PICKED UP A FIRST FEW DOWNS AND THEN ENDED UP GETTING INTO THAT RHYTHM, AND THEY THREW THE TOUCHDOWN PASS TO DYONTAE LET'S SEE IF THEY CAN PICK UP WHERE THEY LEFT OFFICE IN OFFENSE BECAUSE THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME THEY FELT LIKE THEY FOUND THE OFFENSE OF KIND OF RHYTHM -- OFFENSIVE KIND OF RHYTHM THEY WERE LOOKING FOR THE FIRST 30 MINUTES. AL: TRUBISKY SIX OF 11 FOR 61 YARDS. IN THE POCKET. SETTLE FOR UNDERNEATH. NOTHING HAPPENING RIGHT THERE AS HARRIS IS TAKEN DOWN. KIRK: TRUBISKY HAS BEEN CHALLENGED HIS ENTIRE LIKE A LOT OF QUARTERBACKS IN THE NFL. TONIGHT, YOU SAW HIM CHALLENGED. BUT CROWD IS BREWING, CHANTING MASON RUDOLPH, BREWING HIM OR IS NOT MOSTLY AFTER ANY INCOMPLETION AND HE IS ABLE TO FIGHT THROUGH THAT ADVERSITY. AND LOOK AT MASON RUDOLPH AND GET THEM ON THE BOARD. I DON' I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WILL BRING IT BACK ONTO THE SECOND HALF BUT HE SHOWED A LOT OF GUTS TO GET THROUGH THAT PART OF THE GAME. AL: SECOND DOWN AND 10. DRAW, HARRIS. FUNNY, YOU HAVE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME WHERE OFTENTIMES IF THE STARTER IS NOT DOING WELL, THEY WANT THE NUMBER TWO QUARTERBACK IS THE MOST POPULAR GUY IN TOWN. TONIGHT, FOR A WHILE, THE NUMBER THREE QUARTERBACK WAS THE MOST POPULAR GUY. KIRK: NO DOUBT. MASON RUDOLPH WAS BOOED LAST YEAR WHEN THEY BROUGHT HIM IN IN PRESEASON. IT'S BEEN ONE OF THOSE YEARS FOR THIS OFFENSE. ANYTIME YOU LET YOUR OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR GO IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR, IT' THE YEAR, IT'S A STRUGGLE. THEY ARE SEARCHING FOR AN IDENTITY. AL: THE NUMBER ONE QUARTERBACK KENNY PICKETT HAD SURGERY. MISSING FOUR WEEKS. THIRD AND FOUR, PASS CAUGHT. THAT WILL PICK UP A FIRST DOWN. GET THE CROWD INTO IT. KIRK: IT'S A NICE OPTION ROUT. HE'S SUCH A DANGEROUS WEAPON, HAS SUCH A GOOD FEEL FOR ZONE OR MAN. IT'S LIKE HE TROTS OFF THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. FIRST OF LEVERAGE, RETURNS. DEPENDING ON WHAT DEFENSE THEY ARE IN, HE KNOWS EXACTLY HOW FAR HE NEEDS TO GO TO GET BEYOND THIS TICKS. JUS FLIPS AROUND AND TRUBISKY IS LOCKED IN. AL: THE 10TH OF THE NIGHT. DAVID TO AUSTIN. GIVES IT TO WARRANT. CIRCLES ALL THE WAY BACK, STARTS TO STUMBLE, THAT ONE DOESN'T WORK. SECOND DOWN, WISE MAKES A THAT'S A LOSS OF SEVEN YARD. KIRK: THEY HAD THAT BIG RIVERS THEY DON'T FOOL HIM THIS TIME. WISE DOES HIS JOB. THIS GUY IS A BIG MAN, VERY UNDERRATED AT 6'6" 280. GARZA LOOKED DOWN THEN SEES WHAT WARREN IS DOING AND JUST BY GETTING IN THE WAY AND SLOWING HIM DOWN ALLOWS THE SPEED OF THAT DEFENSE. GOOD DISCIPLINE THAT TIME AND GOOD DIVISION BY THE BIG DEFENSIVE END, DEATRICH WISE. GETS TO ABOUT THE 30-YARD LINE. THIRD AND 11 UPCOMING. KIRK: ON AN NATIONAL LEVEL, YOU LOOK AT THAT NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE, NAME SOME GREAT PLAYERS ON THIS PATRIOTS DEFENSE. THAT'S WHY LOVE IS DEEP AND SO MUCH, IT'S REALLY HARD TO THINK OF NAMES AND JUST JUMP OUT. WITH HIM OUT WITH HIS INJURY, THERE IS NOT THAT GUY. ROOKIE CHRISTIAN GONZALEZ FLASHING EARLY THEN HE GOES DOWN WITH INJURY. OTHER THAN THAT, THERE IS A BUNCH OF GUYS WHO LOVE TO PLAY FOOTBALL TOGETHER AND PLAY HARD. AL: THAT'S HAPPENED A LOT. BELLA CHECK BRINGS GUYS OFF THE STREET, THEY DO THE JOB. THIRD DOWN AND 10, CATCH IS MADE. THROWS FOR A FIRST DOWN. CONNOR HEYWARD, JAMES' BROTHER. AND IT'S ENOUGH FOR A FIRST. KIRK: I WAS LOOKING FOR 97 TO COME DOWN AND GIVE A BIG BEAR HUG. WHAT A JUMP BY THE BIG MAN TO GET UP AND OVER. I THOUGHT HE IS CHECKING IT DOWN, THEY WILL HAVE TO PUNT THIS AWAY, BUT HEYWARD HAD DIFFERENT IDEAS. FIRST, THE ATHLETICISM THERE, THEN THE POWER TO BOUNCE OFF OF THAT THEN THE AWARENESS TO GET THE BALL ACROSS. AL: JOHN'S LOOKING AT THE LICENSE PLATE ON TRUCK. FIRST DOWN FROM THE 40-YARD TACKLING, HARRIS MIGHT'VE BEEN A TWO-YARD LOSS, SEVEN YARD GAIN. DOUG ARE MAKING THE TACKLE. KIRK: LOOKS LIKE JENNINGS HAD IT, THEN DUGGER. THAT' THAT'S WHAT NAJEE HARRIS BRINGS TO THIS OFFENSE IS THAT PHYSICALITY. A BIT MORE EXPLOSIVE. THIS YEAR, HE IS 11 RUNS OVER 15 YARDS OR MORE. IN 21 AND 2022 HAD 16, SO HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO STRETCH THINGS OUT. THAT TIME, IT WAS ALL ABOUT THOSE TACKLES. AL: WARREN BACK IN THERE. FLIP IT TO WARREN. AND WARREN TAKES IT ACROSS THE 15 TO THE 4-YARD LINE. OF THE PATRIOTS. BRYANT MAKES A TACKLE, FIRST DOWN STEELERS. KIRK: MUCH LIKE WE THOUGHT THE END OF THE FIRST HALF ON THAT DRIVE THAT LED TO TOUCHDOWN, COUPLE REVERSES, SOME SCREENS, GET THE BALL TO WARREN OUT IN SPACE. ALMOST GOT AHEAD OF HIS LINEMEN BUT PUT THE BRAKES ON, LET THEM GET OUT IN FRONT OF HIM. AL: WARREN, STACKED UP. LAWRENCE GUY IS RIGHT THERE. GUY IN HIS 13TH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE. SECOND AND LONG. KIRK: ANOTHER GUY THAT YOU DON'T THINK MUCH OF, BUT THESE DEFENSIVE LINEMEN, USUALLY YOU THINK ABOUT THESE GUYS AT 3, 4, THEY WILL EAT UP THESE LINEMEN. LOOK HOW HE USES HIS HANDS AND GETS OFF THE BLOCKS. THAT'S A THING OF BEAUTY. USUALLY, BIG DEFENSIVE LINEMAN, THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO KEEP THOSE LINEBACKERS FREE, BUT ROTATING IN, STAYING FRESH. AL: CAME OVER FROM BALTIMORE SIX YEARS AGO. 13TH SEASON IN THE LEAGUE FOR LAWRENCE GUY. SECOND DOWN AND EIGHT. THAT PASS DANGEROUS AND MYLES BRYANT WAS THERE. OVER THE TOP OF ALLEN ROBINSON. THIRD DOWN AND EIGHT NOW. KIRK: I DO LIKE MYLES BRYANT WAS IN THE OFFENSIVE HUDDLE, FOURTH-YEAR PLAYER OUT OF WASHINGTON, THESE TWO ARE RIGHT IN THE SLOT AND HE JUMPS THIS. HE JUMPED OUT BEFORE THE BALL EVEN GOT OUT. HE IS SIMPLY READING ALLEN ROBINSON. DOESN'T FEEL ANY THREAT AT ALL ALLEN ROBINSON IS EITHER BLOCKING OR EVERYTHING IS UNDERNEATH, THAT'S WHY HE YOU A CUSHION. BUT GREAT QUICK REACTION ALLOWS HIM TO GET IN THERE AND SEPARATE THAT FOOTBALL. AL: SEND IN AN EXTRA MAN AND THEY GET SACKED BACK AT THE 49-YARD LINE. BRYAN AND DUGGER BOTH COMING IN. THEY BLOCKED DUGGER OUT OF WHAT WAS THE TOUCHDOWN PASS BEFORE. NOT THIS TIME, FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: THEY ARE MIXING UP THEIR LOOKS, DOING IT MOSTLY ON THE THIRD DOWN PLAYS. CONFUSED HIM, TAKEAWAYS, PRIMARY OFF TO THE LEFT HE DOESN'T HAVE AN ANSWER. YOU CAN SEE HOW COMFORTABLE HE WAS WITH HIS HIGH, ONCE HE GOT OFF HIS PRIMARY REED WHICH WAS TAKEN AWAY EYES WENT DOWN, NO ANSWER. AL: TO BOOTVIDEO. BEAUTIFUL SHOT OF DOWNTOWN PITTSBURGH ON A 44 DEGREE WIND NOT A FACTOR. ZAPPE THROWS, CAUGHT ELLIOT TACKLED IN THE BACKFIELD. ZZEKE HAVING A NICE NIGHT WITH A 16-YARD GAIN. RHAMONDRE STEVENSON IS THEIR NUMBER ONE BACK, BUT HE IS HURT. HE IS OUT AT LEAST TONIGHT AND WE WILL SEE WHETHER HE PLAYS AGAIN IN THEIR NEXT GAME IN 10 DAYS. MEANWHILE, ZEKE SHOWING A LOT OF WHAT HE SHOWED IN DALLAS. NOW YOU HAVE GOT KEEANU BENTON, THE RICKY OUT OF WISCONSIN WHO HAS BEEN A FORCE OF LATE WHO IS DOWN ON THE GRASS. WITH THE WORDS FOR PICKENS AFTER THE BREAK. KIRK: HE'S COMMUNICATING HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO SHOW MATURITY AND KEEP FIGHTING AND BE PART OF WHAT THIS OFFENSE IS TRYING TO DO. EVERYBODY IS FRUSTRATED, YOU HAVE TO FIGHT THROUGH IT. AL: PICKENS TONIGHT STORING ONE ON TARGET, FOUR YARDS AND THREE. RUSHED TO 36, ZAPPE THROWS, KNOCKED DOWN AND A FLAG DOWN. KIRK: MCDERMOTT, LEFT TACKLE HOLDING ON NATE HERBIG. REFEREE: HOLDING, OFFENSE NUMBER 75, 10-YARD PENALTY. REPLAY FIRST DOWN. AL: TRENT BROWN IS THEIR NUMBER ONE GUY, BUT MISSED THREE GAMES THIS YEAR. HERBIG HAS A BIG ROLE TONIGHT WITH ALEX HIGHSMITH NOW FOR THE REST OF THE GAME. THE ROOKIE OUT OF WISCONSIN HAS GREAT TWITCH. BIT OF A BETWEEN HER COMING OUT, HE IS SIX FOOT TWO ABOUT 240 BUT HE WORKS VERY HARD WITH T.J. WATT, ANOTHER HARD WORKER. HE HAS ALWAYS STUDIED T.J. WATT. AL: FIRST AND 20. ELLIOTT MAKES THE GRAB, COASTS TO THE INSIDE. OUT TO THE 34 GOES ZEKE. YOU MENTIONED AS A ROOKIE LEAD THE LEAGUE IN RUSHING, LED IN RUSHING HIS THIRD YEAR. STELLAR CAREER. THE NIGHT HE JUMPED INTO THE SALVATION ARMY BARREL ON THE SUNDAY NIGHT GAME. I JUST CAN'T FORGET IT. KIRK: BIG PERSONALITY, GREAT TO SEE HIM GET THIS OPPORTUNITY THEY HAVE NOT RUN THE FOOTBALL TONIGHT WITH ZEKE ELLIOTT. NOT ABLE TO RUN IT WELL. BUT HE DOES HAVE SIX CATCHES. THEY ARE FINDING WAYS TO GET HIS HANDS ON THE BALL. AL: 85 YARDS FROM SCRIMMAGE. SECOND DOWN AND 12. THERE HE GOES AGAIN. WENT UP AND OVER THE 2000 CARRY MARK IN HIS CAREER IN THE FIRST HE WILL MAKE A THIRD DOWN AND ABOUT SEVEN. KIRK: TO GO BACK TO WHAT BAILEY ZAPPE AND TRUBISKY, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEING AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS GAME IS NOT JUST PLAYING LIKE ZAPPE HAS MAKING PLAYS, BUT GETTING IN YOUR OWN TERRITORY AVOIDING THAT TURNOVER. TRUBISKY THREW ONE, GAVE THE PATRIOTS GREAT FIELD POSITION, ENDED UP CATCHING IT FOR A ZAPPE WAS IN THE ZONE IN THE FIRST HALF. LET'S SEE WHAT HE DOES WITH THIS OPPORTUNITY ON THIRD DOWN. AL: ZAPPE IS 0 FOR 220 AND 3 THIRD AND SEVEN, HANGING IN BUT NOT FOR LONG. CAN HEYWARD, WHO HAS BEEN RELATIVELY QUIET TONIGHT, BUT SPECTACULAR CAREER IN HIS 13TH SEASON OUT OF OHIO STATE PICKED HIM NUMBER ONE BACK IN 2011, GETS THE STACK HERE. KIRK: HOW GREAT TO SEE NUMBER 97 GOT GOING UP AGAINST THE ROOKIE RIGHT GUARD AND WORKS THROUGH HE HAS SUCH GREAT STRENGTH WITH THAT BULRUSH. GOOD COVERAGE DOWNFIELD FREES HIM UP TO GET HOME. AL: ROOKIE BRYCE BARINGER. SENDS IT TOWARD THE NEAR SIDE LINE AND BOUNCES OUT OF BOUNDS NEAR THE PITTSBURGH BENCH AND THEY WILL SPOT THE BALL AT THE A THEY KNOW, THEY DON'T KNOW. EXCEPT FOR MAYBE THOSE GUYS. BUT THE OPTIONS ARE MANIFOLD GOING INTO NEXT SEASON. DOES HE COME BACK TO COACH THE TEAM AGAIN NEXT YEAR IS ONE WAY. MEANWHILE, TRUBISKY THROWS HERE. SHORT PASS CAUGHT BY PICKENS DOES ANOTHER TEAM HIGHER HIM, AND THEN A TRADE IS AFFECTED, THAT'S THE WAY HE CAME TO NEW ENGLAND IN A TRADE WITH THE JETS BACK IN 2003 DOES HE GET FIRED? I SAY THE CHANCES OF BETTER ARE 0.2%. DOES HE GO INTO TELEVISION? YOU KNOW HOW CRAZY THAT SOUNDS, BUT HE WON AN EMMY ON THAT BEST OF 100 SHOW. RICH EISEN DID A FANTASTIC JOB. SECOND DOWN AND FIVE HERE. THE TOSS BACK HERE. KIRK: THE ONLY GUY THAT KNOWS HIS BILL BELICHICK. AL: ROBERT KRAFT WOULD HAVE TO KNOW. HOW ABOUT THIS? IF HE GOES INTO TELEVISION, THEY PUT HIM IN THE BOOTH WITH TOM BURKART AND TOM BRADY NEXT YEAR ON FOX. MORGAN GOES ON TO HER WITH JON BON JOVI, SO WE HAVE ALL THESE POSSIBILITIES AND NOBODY KNOWS RIGHT NOW. KIRK: YOU ARE THROWING THEM ALL OUT RIGHT NOW. AL: TAKE YOUR PICK. KIRK: WITH TOM BRADY, THAT WOULD BE FUN. AL: JIM AND THOSE GUYS A BUNCH OF YEARS BACK IN BASEBALL. KIRK: HE DID A GREAT JOB WHEN HE DID BEST STUDIO SHOW WITH CHRIS. AL: THIRD DOWN AND SIXTH. ONE-HANDED CATCH WHAT SORT OF A FIRST DOWN BY PLENTY. JONATHAN JONES MAKES THE STOP. THIS WILL BE THE ONGOING SAGA IN ANOTHER TEAM THAT WANTS HIM, IT HAS TO BE A RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM SITUATION. YOU HAVE TO BUILD A NEW STAFF BASICALLY. KIRK: I THINK THE BIGGEST QUESTION THAT HE HAS TO ANSWER HIMSELF IS, DOES HE STILL HAVE THE FIRE? DOES HE STILL WAKE UP AND HAVE THAT COMPETITIVE FIRE? NOBODY, AGAIN, KNOWS THAT EXCEPT HIMSELF. AL: CAUGHT AT THE 31-YARD LINE BY MYLES BRYANT. YOU LOOK AT HIS CAREER ACCOMPLISHMENTS. OF COURSE, TONS OF THEM. 300 REGULAR SEASON WINS, 31 POSTSEASON CHAMPIONSHIPS AS YOU KNOW. THE LOMBARDI'S 11 STRAIGHT DIVISION TITLES. TOOK OVER IN 2000. HE WAS GOING TO BECOME THE HEAD COACH OF THE NEW YORK JETS. THAT FAMOUS PRESS CONFERENCE WHERE HE LEFT HIS NOTE ON THE TABLE IN THE PODIUM. NOT GOING TO BE THE HC OF THE NYJ. KRAFT HAD TO GIVE UP THE ONE PICK FOR HIM. THEN HE WAS OFF TO THE RACES. KIRK: THE BIGGEST THING WE HAVE LEARNED THESE LAST FEW YEARS WITH TOM BRADY MOVING ON. AS GOOD AS BILL BELICHICK IS, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET ANOTHER TOM BRADY, BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DIFFERENCE MAKER AT THAT POSITION TO GIVE YOURSELF A CHANCE TO BE COMPETITIVE. AL: OUR PREGAME DREW HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING BELICHICK IS NOTHING WITHOUT BRADY. THAT'S TOTAL NONSENSE. THEY WERE A HELL OF A TEAM. KIRK: IT IS LIKE BILL WALSH AND JOE MONTANA. BILL WALSH WAS OUTSTANDING. HE WAS VERY GOOD WHEN JOE MONTANA WAS BACK THERE AND STEVE YOUNG. IT WORKS HAND-IN-HAND. AL: SECOND AND THREE. AND ELLIOTT WILL SET UP ANOTHER DOWN AND SHORT. KIRK: IF THERE IS ONE AREA YOU WILL CRITIQUE, IT'S NOT THE FOOTBALL COACH, WHAT HE DOES, IT IS PUTTING THE ROSTER TOGETHER, WHAT THEY HAVE DONE THESE L TWO YEARS. THAT'S THE ASPECT IF YOU WILL REALLY CRITIQUE AND LOOK AT NEW ENGLAND AND SAY THEY CAN GET BETTER. THAT'S THE OBVIOUS AREA THAT JUMPS OUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE DRAFT PICKS. AL: LOOK, HE GOT ALL OF THE POWER AFTER HE WON THAT THIRD SUPER BOWL. IT WAS THE COACH, EVEN THOUGH HE HAD OTHER GUYS IN THE OFFICE WHO WERE IMPORTANT. NIKOS AREA, BERNIE ADAMS AND OTHER PEOPLE. IT WAS BILL WHO MADE THE ULTIMATE DECISIONS. THIRD AND TWO. THAT WILL BE A FIRST DOWN. JUST TO PUT A BALL ON IT, DOES HE GO SOMEPLACE ELSE,, HE GO SOMEPLACE ELSE, FOR IT WILL BUILD JUST SAY YOU KNOW TEAMS? KIRK: ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, IF HE COMES BACK, HE WILL PROBABLY GO AND BUY A QUARTERBACK. DO THEY GO AND TRY TO FIND A QUARTERBACK ALREADY IN THE LEAGUE? DO THEY GO OUT WITH THE DRAFT. A LOT OF BIG NAMES COMING OUT WITH THE DRAFT THIS YEAR THAT ARE VERY CAPABLE. BUT YOU ARE STARTING OVER WITH ANOTHER ROOKIE QUARTERBACK. IT WILL BE AN INTERESTING OFF-SEASON WITH NEW ENGLAND AND EVERYTHING IN FRONT OF THEM. AL: ZAPPE, BROKEN UP, INTERCEPTED! FITZPATRICK WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF MEANWHILE, THAT IS WALKER, MYKAL WALKER WITH THE INTERCEPTION. TAKING IT DOWN DEEP INTO NEW ENGLAND TERRITORY. KIRK: THEY HAVE ATTACKED THESE THIS TIME IT IS ROBERTS WHO LOOKS LIKE HE GETS INVOLVED NUMBER 50. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A PLAY ON THE BALL. HE ATTACKED THIS AREA MOST O THIS GAME. GOOD JOB BY ROBERTS WHO IS KNOWN MORE FOR HIS FIRST AND SECOND DOWN PLAY BUT THIS TIME AGAINST DUE SMITH HE IS ABLE TO GET HIS HAND IN AND NOT THAT BALL THESE. HE GETS UP IN THE AIR SO IF YOU GO IN THAT REGION THIS TIME, IT ENDS UP PAYING FOR THE STEELERS. GOOD HEADS UP PLAY. WE TALKED ABOUT THESE QUARTERBACKS. DON'T MAKE DISASTROUS PLAY IN YOUR OWN TERRITORY. PATRIOTS HAVE DONE THAT RIGHT HERE WITH ZAPPE. AL: WALKER, FOURTH YEAR OUT OF FRESNO STATE. PICKED HIM UP AS A FREE AGENT MAKES THE PLAY THAT CAN PUT THEM RIGHT BACK INTO THE GAME. AFTER A ONE-YARD CARRY HERE. GODCHAUX MAKES THE TACKLE HERE. FINAL MINUTE OF THE THIRD KIRK: THIS FIRST HALF WHEN THEY WERE DOWN 21-3, WE SAID WHERE IS THE LEADERSHIP? THIS IS A TEAM THAT IS 7-5 IN THE THICK OF THINGS IN AN AFC WILD CARD RACE. THEY ARE NOT PLAYING LIKE THAT AFTER A TOUGH GAME LAST WEEK AGAINST THE CARDINALS. GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR GIVING THEMSELVES A CHANCE. NOW CAN THEY CAPITALIZE AND INTO THE END ZONE? AL: SECOND AND NINE. GOOD COVERAGE AS WELL BY THE SECONDARY. HE HAS TO FLIP IT AWAY. BOOS RAIN DOWN AGAIN. THIRD AND NINE. KIRK: GOOD PROTECTION. BETTER COVERAGE DOWNFIELD. ALL YOU CAN DO IS THROW IT AWAY. HERE THEY GO, BIG THIRD DOWN. ONLY HIT THREE OF 10 SO FAR. AL: TRUBISKY HAS THROWN FOR ONLY 92 YARDS. ON 12 OF 19. THIRD DOWN AND NINE. PRESSURE FROM BEHIND. HE'S GOING TO RUN. TRUBISKY LOOKING FOR THE FIRST DOWN BUT CAUGHT A LITTLE BIT SHORT. STARTS TO SLIDE A COUPLE BENTLEY IS THERE. AND A FOURTH AND TWO TO BEGIN THE FOURTH PERIOD. END OF THREE IN PITTSBURGH. 21-10, NEW ENGLAND. GO FOR IT, KICK IT, AND THEY ARE GOING TO GO FOR IT. HAD HIS HELMET ON ON THE SIDELINES. RIGHT FROM THE GET-GO, THEY WILL GO FOR IT ON FOURTH DOWN. AND A LONG TWO. TRUBISKY, DANCING, FLIPS IT AND IT'S GOING TO BE SHORT OF A FIRST DOWN AND THEY WILL TURN THE BALL OVERPAID HE FLIPPED IT TO WARREN. NEEDED TWO YARDS, GOT ONE. PATRIOTS TAKEOVER, YOU HAVE GOT MACK WILSON IN ON THE STOP. KIRK: THE PATRIOTS KNOW THIS IS THE TARGET WHEN THEY GET DOWN TO THIS AREA. WATCH WHAT THEY DO TO FREIERMUTH YOU HAVE TWO GUYS, ONE OF THEM HITS HIM. BENTLEY, HE BREAKS FREE, BUT BY THE TIME HE SEES HIM IT IS TOO LATE. HE FLIPS IT TO WARREN BECAUSE OF THAT RECOGNITION BY BENTLEY. GOOD JOB ANTICIPATING THE BIG TIGHT END AS THE TARGET. TOOK HIM AWAY, AND YOU SEE THE FRUSTRATION FOR THE STEELERS. AL: WILSON RIGHT THERE AS WELL. SO THEY GET THE BALL BACK AT THEIR OWN SEVEN-YARD LINE. TOMLIN ROLLING THE DICE. AND CRAPPING OUT ON THAT ONE. DOWN BY 11, PASS ON THE OUTSIDE, SHORT AGAIN. THORNTON MAKES THE CATCH. PATRICK PETERSON, 13TH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE, BEEN AROUND LONG TIME, ARIZONA AND RECENTLY, WITH THE STOP. KIRK: THE BIGGER PLAY ZEKE ELLIOTT HAS MADE TONIGHT WAS ON THAT INTERCESSION WHERE HE HUSTLED AND PREVENTED PITTSBURGH FROM GETTING IN THE END ZONE ON THAT INTERCEPTION. CHASED IT DOWN AND HUSTLED. FORCED THE STEELERS OFFENSE ONTO THE FIELD. AL: SECOND AND SEVEN. ELLIOTT OVER THE RIGHT SIDE. 30 AND TWO. KIRK: GO BACK TO THAT THE INTERCEPTION. IT WAS A GOOD PLAY. WE TALKED ABOUT ROBERTS MAKING A PLAY TO DEFLECT IT. WALKER GETS THE TIP. HUSTLED DOWN FIELD, IF HE DOESN'T MAKE THAT PLAY, HE GOES INTO THE END ZONE. SO, GOOD JOB COMING UP WITH THAT DEFENSE STEPS UP. AL: ZEKE GETTING THE OPPORTUNITY WITH AN INJURY TO STEPHENSON. AND MAKING THE VERY MOST OF IT. YOU'RE RIGHT, THAT TACKLE SAYING IT WOULD'VE BEEN A TOUCHDOWN. THIRD DOWN AND TWO. FROM THE 15 YARD LINE. ZAPPE FLUSHED OUT. GOING TO THROWN THE RUN ALONG THE SIDELINE, AND THAT IS THORNTON WHO IS THERE. AND IT'S INCOMPLETE. SO, FROM DEEP IN THEIR OWN TERRITORY, THEY WILL PUNTED BACK TO THE STEELERS. KIRK: THERE'S THIS BEEN MOVE FROM T.J. WATT ON THE OUTSIDE BACK TO THE INSIDE. FLUSHES HIM. ZAPPE, DON'T MAKE THAT CRITICAL ERROR, ALMOST DOES IT AGAIN. THERE IS BEHIND HIM LATE. THE LOOK HOW CLOSE THAT WAS NEVER AN INTERCEPTION. AL: AND THE KICK IS GOING TO BE BLOCKED. THEIR SPECIAL TEAMS MAVEN GETS IN THERE. THAT'S GOING TO SET PITTSBURGH UP. P AT AROUND THE 25-YARD LINE. KIRK: EVER SINCE THE TOUCHDOWN AT THE END OF THE FIRST HALF, THE STEELERS HAVE COME ALIVE. THEY HAVE TO CAPITALIZE ON THE OPPORTUNITIES. THEY MISSED IT AFTER THE GOOD HUSTLE PLAY RIGHT HERE. BOUNCES RIGHT OFF HIS CHEST. AND THE STEELERS ARE GOING TO GET OUTSTANDING FIELD POSITION. AL: THE SPECIAL TEAMS ACE, AL: THE SPECIAL TEAMS ACE. FALSE KIDS OUT TO THE 26-YARD 1330 BAM TO PLAY IN AL: YOU WOULD THINK AT SOME POINT, HAVEN'T DONE IT YET. THERE HE IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE. STACKED RECEIVERS KEEP IT ON THE GROUND HERE. NICE RUN HERE. GAIN OF SIX. NAJEE HARRIS TO THE 20-YARD LINE, SECOND DOWN. KIRK: GREAT PUSH ON THAT DUAL BLOCK DOUBLE-TEAMED TO THE INSIDE, ABLE TO GET UP TO THOSE THEY HAVEN' THEY HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF SURGES INTO THAT PATRIOTS FRONT ESPECIALLY BETWEEN THE TACKLES. THAT TIME WE DID. VERY POSITIVE GAIN ON FIRST AND SQUANDERED THE OPPORTUNITY AFTER NOW ANOTHER GOOD OPPORTUNITY AL: IT WAS 21-3 AT ONE POINT. ANOTHER POINT GAIN RIGHT NOW. PITTSBURGH TRYING TO NARROW THE MARGIN. SECOND DOWN AND FOUR. PLAY-ACTION UNDER PRESSURE. GETS IT AWAY, CAUGHT AND DOWN THE SIDELINE GOES DARNELL WASHINGTON THE BIG TIGHT END. 6'7", 264, HIS FIRST CATCH OF KIRK: REALLY BUILT LIKE A TACKLE. AT GEORGIA, HE WOULD GET HIS HANDS ON THE FOOTBALL. BUT WASHINGTON NOT KNOWN AS JUST BEING A BLOCKER. I BE SURPRISED IF THAT IS WHAT HE HAS BEEN DOING FOR PITTSBURGH'S OFFENSE, BUT TALK ABOUT A WEAPON DOWN THE RED 6'7" LIKE YOU SAID, 260 FOUR POUNDS AND CAN MOVE? AL: PITTSBURGH DRESSED FOUR TIGHT ENDS TONIGHT, HE IS ONE OF THEM. HEYWARD ANOTHER, HAS CAUGHT TWO. NOW YOU HAVE TO TAKE A TIMEOUT TO HIS CHAGRIN. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, TONIGHT'S JOURNEY IS BEING PRESENTED BY KHYUNDAI. BAILEY ZAPPE WITH THREE TOUCHDOWNS IN THE FIRST HALF. THERE ARE HIS NUMBERS, 93 YARDS AND A LITTLE MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS. NOTHING MORE FOR T.J. WATT WHO WAS IN AND OUT OF THE MEDICAL TENT TONIGHT. NO SEX FOR HIM YET. K KIRK: WA HADT TO SHOW TOUGHNESS GETTING THROUGH THAT FIRST PLAY. TO GIVE CREDIT, THEYT HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB ON PASS PROTECTION. AL: THEY REPLACE THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM I'M BEING TOLD IN TRUBISKY'S HELMET. THAT'S WHY THEY HAD TO TAKE THEIR TIMEOUT, WHICH IS VERY SIGNIFICANT IN THE SECOND HALF OF A CLOSE GAME. FIRST AND GOAL. TRUBISKY TO THE ENDZONE. THAT'S INCOMPLETE. FIRE MOVE COVERED BY JACKSON. -- FRIERMUTH COVERED BY JACKSON. KIRK: THIS IS WHAT MAKES FREIERMUTH SO EFFECTIVE IS HE CAN BE IN LINE TRADITIONAL TIGHT END, OR YOU CAN FLEX HIM OUT BECAUSE THE HAS THE SKILL SET TO RUN THESE ROUTES. REFEREE: THE BALL WAS PLACED AT THE ONE-YARD LINE. AL: JACKSON IS A MISMATCH AS FAR AS PHYSICALITY OUT IN SPACE. DOESN'T HAVE THE QUICKNESS BUT HE HAS THE SIZE. THAT WAS TOUGH FOR JACKSON WHO JUST GRABS ONTO IT. THORNTON COMES IN AS THE ELIGIBLE RECEIVER RIGHT NOW. THE TACKLE, FIRST DOWN AND GOAL. LOOK AT THIS, INCOMPLETE OF ALL CONNOR HEYWARD THROWING IT. WILSON IS THERE TO KNOCK IT THEY GO TO THE BACK OF THE PLAYBOOK. YOU TELL ME ON A FIRST AND GOAL. KIRK: THEY ARE TRYING TO GET CREATIVE WITH THIS IS IN THE PLACE FOR THIS GREAT TIGHT END THROWING A PASS ON FIRST AND GOAL AFTER PASS INTERFERENCE. WILSON ALMOST COMES DOWN WITH THAT IS COVERED DOWNFIELD AS WELL. YOU ARE AT THE ONE-YARD LINE, JUST POUND THE ROCK. AL: NO PITTSBURGH SPECIAL ON SECOND AND GOAL. GOING INTO THE END ZONE, TRUBISKY DOES IT HIMSELF. TOMLIN SAYS WE WILL GO FOR TWO TO MAKE IT A THREE-POINT GAME. KIRK: HECK OF A JOB ON THAT PLAY BY MASON BOWLES, WHO TOOK THE NOSE GUARD OUT. MADE IT EASY FOR TRUBISKY TO GO OVER THE TOP OF HIM. AL: TRYING TO SHAVE IT TO THE MARGIN OF A FIELD GOAL RIGHT NOW. TWO-POINT PLAY COMING UP. 11:44 LEFT IN THE FOURTH. PICKENS MOVES TO THE INSIDE. THE PASS IS CAUGHT. FREIERMUTH FOR THE TWO POINTS. TURNED AN 18-POINT DEFICIT INTO A THREE-POINT DEFICIT. BLOCKED KICK RIGHT THERE. AL: A STEALER TRADITION, "RENEGADE." A LOT TO YELL AND SNAP YOUR FEET ABOUT, ESPECIALLY TURNING AN 18-POINT DEFICIT INTO A THREE-POINT DEFICIT. KIRK: YOU LOOK AT THIS WIN PROBABILITY, LOOK AT OUR STATS POWERED BY AWS. THIS IS BEFORE AND AFTER THE BLOCKED PUNT. THIS TEAM HAS FOUGHT, PUT THEMSELVES INTO POSITION AFTER THE SCORE. 33%, HITS THE TWO-POINTER AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE STADIUM IS ALIVE. THIS IS WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT. THIS IS WHAT MIKE TOMLIN TALKED ABOUT. IT'S REDEMPTION WAIT FOR THEM AFTER LAST WEEK'S GAME. NOW THEY ARE STARTING TO SHOW THAT HEART AND ATTITUDE YOU EXPECT FROM A MIKE TOMLIN COACHED TEAM. AL: AFTER AN AWFUL FIRST QUARTER AND A HALF. HERE IS ELLIOT, AND HIS BIG NIGHT CONTINUES. AS HE SKIRTS THE SIDELINE COMES CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN. HE WILL SPIKE THE BALL JUST A LITTLE BIT SHORT OF IT. KIRK: ZAPPE STARTS 14 AND 21, WE WERE ALL MARVELING AROUND THE COUNTRY AT 196 YARDS, THREE GETS SACKED BY ROBERTS, AND SINCE THEN, JUST FOUR OF SIX FOR ABOUT 35 YARDS. AL: COME BACK TO EARTH. SECOND AND INCHES. ZEKE, AS SOON AS HE GETS TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, COMING INTO THIS SPOT RIGHT NOW IS ELANDON ROBERTS AND HE IS THERE BUT ZEKE GOT THE INCHES NECESSARY. KIRK: PATRIOTS TRY TO WORK A DOUBLE TEAM TO GET UP TO THESE BACKERS, BUT THEY ARE NOT HESITATING, SO THEY PICK UP THE BUT WATCH HOW FAST THESE GUYS ARE GETTING DOWNHILL. MAKES IT TOUGH FOR THE LINEMEN. 62 AND 71 WANT TO GET UP TO THOSE LINEBACKERS BUT TOUGH TO DO WHEN THEY ARE FLYING ELLIOTT TACKLED IN THE T.J. WATT WITH A CASTLE -- TACKLE FOR LOSS OF ONE. KIRK: THE RIGHT GUARD PLAYING IN ISSUED IN MICHIGAN LAST NOW A ROOKIE PLAYING FOR THE HE WILL MAKE THIS BLOCK FROM THE RIGHT-HAND SPOT. HE MISSES BECAUSE OF THE QUICKNESS OF T.J. WATT. AGAIN, NOT JUST A PASS RUSHER. GREAT JOB AGAINST THE RUN. AL: ROOKIE OUT OF EASTERN MICHIGAN, FOURTH ROUND PICK. ZAPPE IS GOING TO TAKE OFF BUT NOT GET VERY FAR. THE HELMET. LOOKS AROUND FOR THE CALL, DOESN' DOESN'T GET IT. ROBERTS RIGHT THERE. THIRD DOWN AND 10. TOWELS FURLING. ALMOST EVERYBODY STANDING. THERE TEAM HAS TURNED IT AROUND TOTALLY. IT' IT'S GOING TO BE CAUGHT BUT IS SHY OF A FIRST DOWN. SMITH-SCHUSTER SETTING UP A FOURTH DOWN AND INCHES. PATRICK PETERSON IS THERE TO MAKE THE STOP. CLOCK RUNS DOWN UNDER NINE THEN IN COMES THE PUNT GROUP. KIRK: STEELERS DEFENSE DOES THEIR JOB AGAIN. WE TALKED ABOUT TRUBISKY. THE PLAYS THEY HAVE HAD TO MAKE THEY GIVE THEMSELVES A CHANCE TO GET POINTS ON THE BOARD. BUT THIS STARTS WITH THE STEELERS DEFENSE AFTER GIVING UP EARLY, THEY HAVE BEEN PUTTING UP SOME BLANKS AND GIVING THEIR OFFENSE A CHANCE. AL: BRYCE BARINGER, THIS WILL BE HIS SEVENTH PUNT OF THE NIGHT. THE LAST ONE WAS BLOCKED. GETS THIS ONE AWAY. HE SENDS IT INTO THE END ZONE AND BACK COME THE STEELERS STARTING FROM THE 20-YARD LINE WITH 8:30 TO GO IN T BY BMW. EARLY THIS GAME, T.J. WATT THAT FIRST PLAY TOOK A KNEE FROM ZEKE SAME DRIVE, GETS KICKED IN THE FACE. REALLY TOUGH WAY FOR THE BEST PLAYERS IN THE LEAGUE TO GET STARTED. GIVE MEWING LEND SOME CREDIT, THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HOLD UP BUT 90 IS JUST RELENTLESS GREAT IF YOU CAN'T GET THE PASS RUSH ON, MAKING AN IMPACT GETTING NEW ENGLAND BEHIND THIS TICKS TO FIT IN THIS RUN GAME AND STILL LEADING A BIG SPARK OF THIS DEFENSE TO GET THEM BACK IN THIS KIRK: ONE TACKLE FOR LOSS. NOW TRUBISKY, WHOM THEY WERE TRYING TO BOO OUT OF THE BUILDING AN HOUR AND A HALF AGO, TRYING TO LEAD A GAME-TYING OR GAME CHANGING DRIVE. STARTS WITH A SHORT PASS TO NAJEE HARRIS FOR A GAIN OF FOUR. KIRK: I LIKE WHAT MIKE TOMLIN TOLD US THIS WEEK WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HAVING A BACK UP TO TWO VETERANS. HE SAID ONE I WAS A COACH, WE HAD BIG MEN, AND WE HAD A VETERAN QUARTERBACK, AND ROOKIES THAT WERE THE BACKUPS AND IF HE WENT DOWN IT WAS A CONCERN. NOW YOU HAVE FLIPPED THE SCRIPT. YOU HAVE KENNY PICKETT, YOUNG CORNERBACK. IT HAS TAKEN SOME OF THAT VETERAN LEADERSHIP TO GET THROUGH THE ADVERSITY TONIGHT FOR TRUBISKY. AL: LOW SNAP. THAT'S BEEN AN ISSUE WITH THIS TEAM RECENTLY. LOOKED OUT INTO ALL KINDS OF TRAFFIC AND SOMEHOW, SOMEWAY THAT WASN'T PICKED. KIRK: VOIDED JENNINGS MAKE A GREAT PLAY ON THIS FOOTBALL. YOU ARE RIGHT, YOU TALK ABOUT THAT VETERAN EXPERIENCED. BUT HERE, HE CLEARLY DOES NOT SEE 33. INSTEAD OF RUSHING, THE QUARTERBACK SETS HIS SCREEN, GETS HIS HANDS ON THE RUNNING BACK AND ALMOST GETS HIS HAND ON THAT FOOTBALL TO TIP IT THE AIR. JUST GOOD INSTINCTS ON THAT SECOND DOWN PLAY ON THE SPRING, WHICH THEY HIT A FEW OF THOSE IN THE SECOND HALF. AL: NOW THIRD DOWN AND FIVE. SENDING AN EXTRA MAN. PASS IS HAULED IN AT THE 29-YARD LINE BY FREIERMUTH. AND YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE OFFICIAL IS. THEY WILL SPOT IT SHORT. YOU GOT FOURTH DOWN AND INCHES, 7:20, PUNCH GROUP COMES OUT. CROWD DOESN' CROWD DOESN'T LIKE IT. CROWD LIKES IT. KIRK: GOT A WHISTLE BY THE STEELERS SIDE. THEY WILL CALL A TIMEOUT. AL: OH MAN. THAT LEAVES THEM IN A THREE-POINT GAME WITH ONE AND A LITTLE OVER SEVEN TO PLAY. KIRK: I DON'T THINK YOU CALL A TIMEOUT TO PUNT HERE. THEY WILL GET THIS OFFENS TOGETHER. AL: NEXT WEEK WE'RE IN VEGAS. YOU HAVE GOT THE CHARGERS AND THE RAIDERS PLAYED SOME CLASSICS THROUGH THE YEARS. SAN DIEGO AND OAKLAND, NOW LAS VEGAS. 5-7, BIG GAME AS HE TRIES TO STAY IN THE PLAYOFF ON. THEY DID CALL A TIMEOUT. THEY WILL GO FOR IT AFTER ALL OF WITH THE BALL JUST SHY OF THE 30-YARD LINE. GAIN OF HALF A YARD. HARRIS IS THE RUNNING BACK. TIGHT FORMATION. TRUBISKY KEEPS IT, RUNS OVER THE LEFT GUARD. PICKS UP A FIRST DOWN. NOW THEY LOVE HIM. KIRK: THEY GOT A GOOD PUSH ON THAT LEFT SIDE. WATCH THIS LEFT GUARD, LEFT GOOD JOB BY TRUBISKY. HE WAS INITIALLY GOING TO GET RIGHT BEHIND MASON COLE, BUT ENDS UP SEEING THAT SURGE AND JUST STEPS IN BEHIND THAT LEFT SIDE OF THE OFFENSIVE LINE. AL: SAM WAS RIGHT THERE TO LEAD THE WAY. 6:30 LEFT IN THE FOURTH. TRUBISKY TO THE OUTSIDE. MAKES THE GRAB. PICKS UP ABOUT EIGHT. JONATHAN JONES ON THE TACKLE, KIRK: JONES WALKED UP AND AT THE SNAP OF THE FOOTBALL DROPPED. TRUBISKY ABLE TO LOOK OUT THERE, HE'S BEEN DYING TO GET THE FOOTBALL TO PICKENS ALL NIGHT. HE HAS -- IS HIS GO TO GUY. HAS HAD A RELATIVELY QUIET NIGHT. JUST FOUR CATCHES AND 18 YARDS. AL: LONGEST RECEPTION IS JUST SEVEN YARDS. LONGEST CATCH OF THE NIGHT BY THE ONLY ONE HE HAS GOT TONIGHT. THAT WAS FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. SECOND AND THREE. PICKENS AGAIN. AND HE IS STOPPED IN HIS TRACKS. JONATHAN JONES MAKING THAT THAT'S GOING TO SET UP A THIRD AND THREE. CLOCK RUN DOWN TO 5:40. GOT TO THINK THEY DID IT ONCE, IF THEY DON'T GET IT HERE, THEY WILL GO FOR IT ON FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: AS THAT CLOCK KEEPS TICKING, THE OPPORTUNITIES WILL GET FEWER AND FEWER. NOW THAT THEY ARE DOWN TO ONE TIMEOUT AND THE TWO-MINUTE AL: THAT'LL BE A SACK. THAT WILL BE THE WORST SCENARIO. THIRD AND THREE. TRUBISKY UNDER PRESSURE, ESCAPING AND JUST HAS TO FLING THAT ONE AWAY. FREIERMUTH WAS THERE, HE WAS WELL COVERED. NOW YOU GO TO FOURTH AND THREE. NOW THE PUNT GROUP COMES OUT AND THEY WILL TAKE THE FIELD HERE. KIRK: GIVE CREDIT TO SEE BELLA CHECK AND THAT DEFENSE ON THIRD GOOD JOB OF TAKING AWAY ALL HIS OPTIONS. TRUBISKY ENDS UP THROWING THIS FOOTBALL AWAY. AL: PRESSLEY HARVIN IS SENDING THAT ONE. GOT A COUPLE OF FLAGS. IT WAS FOURTH AND THREE, THAT'S GOING TO BE A FIRST DOWN. IT WAS AGAINST NEW ENGLAND. KIRK: I THINK IT IS TAVAI, NUMBER 48. REFEREE: FALSE START. WALKER, NUMBER 46. KIRK: IT' KIRK: IT'S 48, TAVAI, LINEBACKER. HOW FIRED UP HIS PITTSBURGH? AL: THEY ARE GOING TO GET THEY ARE CALLING THIS ON THE CENTER. AL: HE SAID A FALSE START ON CHRISTIAN KOONTZ. AND IF THAT IS AGAINST PITTSBURGH, CALLING IT A FALSE START, THAT IS THE FIRST PENALTY OF THE NIGHT AGAINST THE STEELERS. AT THE MOST INOPPORTUNE TIME. TERRY, WHAT DID YOU SEE? KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE THEY CALLED HIS HEAD SNAPPING UP. HE CAN DO THAT AS LONG AS IT IS SLOW ON DELIVERY. AL: THEY WILL CHECK THAT OUT AFTER THE POND. WE WILL GO TO BREAK THEN BRING TERRY BACK IN. IT IS FAIR CAUGHT AT THE 14-YARD GO TO A COMMERCIAL THEN WE WILL AL: THEY CALLED OUT CHRISTIAN KUNTZ IN THE MIDDLE. TERRY, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING? TERRY: HE MADE AN ABRUPT MOVEMENT PRIOR TO THE SNAP. OBVIOUSLY IT IS SUBJECTIVE. IT SEEMS LIKE AT THE MOMENT, WE SEE IT FROM A LONG STAFFORD. KIRK: YOU SEE THIS ALMOST EVERY TIME. AL: THE FOOT WAS ON HIM, BUT HE ESCAPES. MEANWHILE, THE WINDOW DOWN ON A SITUATION WHERE HE CAN TAKE THE ONLY THE FOURTH TIME HALFWAY THROUGH. AL: IT LOOKS LIKE THE STEELERS CAUGHT A BREAK WITH TWO BY JUMPING OFF AND -- TAVAI JUMPING RIGHT. THAT CLOCK IS TICKING. THEY USED TWO TIMEOUTS. AL: MAKE SURE ALL OF THEIR POINTS WERE IN THE FIRST HALF. USING THAT PLAYTIME. SEVEN AND 6. THEY WORK TOWARDS ELLIOTT, COMES OVER THREE YARDS SHY OF THE ZEKE TONIGHT HAS. THE BALL 19 TIMES, 53 YARDS. THAT IS NOT PARTICULARLY IMPRESSIVE. THOSE NUMBERS WITH SEVEN CATCHES AND 72. KIRK: THE BIGGEST THING HE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO TONIGHT WAS TO GET THOSE TOUCHES. THE MORE HE GETS, THE BETTER HE GETS, BUT IT IS TOUGH TO RUN THE BALL AGAINST THE STEELERS FRONT. AL: 56 GAMES, LEADING 10 OF THEM MORE. DOWN 18 POINTS AT ONE POINT. THIRD DOWN AND 2. THERE IS ELLIOTT AGAIN, AND THIS TIME HE WILL NOT GET THEM. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE STEELERS NEEDED HERE. THREE AND OUT. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY GET THE BALL BACK. HAYWARD WITH THE OTHER TACKLE. KIRK: YOU TALK ABOUT T.J. WATT AND CAM HAYWARD DID A GREAT JOB USING THAT LEVERAGE, GETTING OFF BY ANDREWS. THESE VETERANS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS AT STAKE AND HOW IMPORTANT THE THREE AND OUT WAS TO PRESERVE THE CLOCK. THEY DID THEIR JOB AGAIN TO GET THE BALL BACK. AL: IS IT HOT OF THE NIGHT. -- HIS EIGTH PUT OF THE THE POSTSEASON PICTURE RIGHT NOW IN MIAMI AND MIAMI IS IN THE TOP OF THEIR DIVISION. JACKSON REACHING FOURTH. AT THE MOMENT, CLEVELAND IS 7-5. SO IS INDIANAPOLIS. YOU GET THE BENGALS. LAS VEGAS AND LOS ANGELES, WE WILL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK. KIRK: ALL FOUR TEAMS IN THE CINCINNATI FOUR WITH THE STEELERS AND THE BROWNS. AL: DOWN TO THE WIRE, ONLY ONE TEAM GETS THE BYE. THE OTHER SIX GET TO THE WILD-CARD ROUND. TRUBISKY FIRES A LITTLE HIGH. IN THE MIDDLE AND INCOMPLETE, KIRK: USUALLY FREIERMUTH WITH HIS RADIUS CAN MAKE THAT CATCH IS AMAZING WHAT THIS STEELERS TEAM HAS HAD TO DO TO GET THEM BACK INTO THIS GAME AND AT THIS POINT, YOU ARE LOOKING FOR FREIERMUTH, LOOKING FOR NAJEE CAN YOU ISOLATE AND DYONTAE JOHNSON HAS HAD A QUIET NIGHT. NOT MANY OPPORTUNITIES OVER 18. AL: JUST THREE CHARGES, ONE CATCH, BUT IT WAS FOR THE GETS IT UP UNDERNEATH. THAT WAS THE RESULT OF THE FIRST TAKING IT TO THE 40 YARD LINE IS NAJEE HARRIS. KIRK: GOOD JOB SHOWING PACE SINCE BY TRUBISKY. INSTEAD OF FORCING, HE EVENTUALLY FINDS THE CHECK DOWN. LET HIM PICK UP THE FIRST HAND. AL: BETTER HURRY UP. TO THE OUTSIDE, TOO HIGH. NO GOOD. HE HAS BEEN TARGETED FOR THE NINE TO GO. KIRK: ONE THING TO TURN THE PATRIOTS THIS YEAR AS THEY DO NOT HAVE THAT DIFFERENCE MAKER LIKE A MATTHEW DO DONE WHO BEGAN THE HOLD WITHOUT THE BLITZ. TYPICALLY THEY HAVE GOT TO DIAL UP THE BLITZ HAVE SOME PRESSURE. IT HAS BEEN THE ACHILLES HEEL FOR THIS DEFENSE ALL YEAR LONG, ESPECIALLY IN THIS SITUATION. CAN THEY AFFORD TRUBISKY AND UP? AL: THEY HAVE HAD TWO SACKS SECOND AND 10. THE OUTSIDE QUICKLY. GETTING OUT OF BOUNDS. JOHNSON FORCED BY J.C. JACKSON. KIRK: JUST TWO PLACE FROM TRUBISKY THAT COULD LET THEM CHECK DOWN TO NAJEE HARRIS. THIS TIME SEES SOFT COVERAGE OUT THERE BY THE CORNER AND FLIPS IT OUT THERE. TAKE THE POSITIVE YARDS, SET UP A THIRD DOWN AND SHORT NEAR THE MIDFIELD. AL: SULLIVAN CALLING IN THE 30 AND 2. HARRIS GETS WIDE TO THE LEFT. THE LEFTY HERE. TRUBISKY FIRES A LITTLE HIGH, COULDN'T GET TO PICKENS. YOU STILL HAVE ONE SECOND BEFORE THE TWO MINUTE WARNING, SO THERE IS THE GO FOR IT ON THE FOURTH AND IN EFFECT, THEY STILL HAVE THAT EXTRA TIME OUT OF THE TWO MINUTE WARNING PLUS THE ONE THEY HAD, BUT THEY HAD TO CONVERT. KIRK: THIS IS IT. FOURTH DOWN AND 2. SEES IT ON THE LINE, OPPORTUNITIES ON THE LINE TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THIS DRIVE ALIVE AND THEIR ENERGY AND HOPES. AL: JAYLEN WARREN IS IN THE NEED TWO, GOING DEEP, GOING FOR THE BALL. INTENDED FOR JOHNSON. SO THEY NEEDED TWO YARDS AND WENT FOR THE HOME RUN. JONATHAN JONES COVERING. ONE PAUSE IS OFFICIALLY ON THE AND THE PATRIOTS STILL UP 1:55 A CONCEIVABLY, THE STEELERS COULD GET THE BALL BACK. WITH NEXT TO NO TIME REMAINING. FIRST THINGS FIRST. KIRK: I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT CALL. AL: NEITHER DID I. FOURTH AND 2. WHO CAME FIRST? >> FALSE START. OFFENSE UNDER 85. KIRK: IT IS EASY TO SIT UP HERE AND GUESS CALLS, BUT IT IS A LOW PERCENTAGE THROW. YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF GO BALLS TO SIT OUTSIDE. YOU JUST THROW IT AND HOPE. IT IS FOURTH AND 2. YOU HAVE NOT THROWN AT DIONTAE JOHNSON ALL NIGHT. IT IS A LOW PERCENTAGE THROW. ROLL IT OUT EITHER ABOVE OR A PINCH. GIVE YOURSELF THE OPTION. JUST THROUGH IT UP THERE. AL: TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU. THE FINAL TIMEOUT. KIRK: THIS IS A TOUGH COUPLE OF WEEKS FOR PITTSBURGH. YOU LOOK AT THAT CARDINALS GAME MAYBE IT WAS AN ABERRATION. A 2-10 TEAM. COMING UP SHORT AGAIN THIS AL: THE STAR OF THE GAME ON THIS THE STEELERS GOT BACK INTO THE GAME AND IT MIGHT BE TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE. IT IS ALL COMING ON THE POST GAME SHOW. KIRK: ON THE OTHER ENGLAND AND BILL BELICHICK LEFT DEAD FOR 2-10. BUT THE FACT THEY CAME OUT AND COMPETED WITH BIG INJURIES. HAPPY TO PLAY WELL AND GREW UP A BIT. SOME POSITIVES AT LEAST FOR NEW ENGLAND TONIGHT. AL: ELLIOTT. THAT SHOULD TAKE US ABOUT TO THE FINISH LINE FOR THE FIRST DOWN AS THE CLOCK KEEPS ON RUNNING, AND IT WILL. YOU LOOK AT NEW ENGLAND'S SEASON AND ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT THEY GOT FLEXED OUT OF THE GAME ON MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL WITH PATRICK MAHOMES COMING TO TOWN. KIRK: [LAUGHTER] THAT SUMS IT UP. AL: IT REALLY DOES. BILL BELICHICK -- >> THE PLAYER IS UNDER REVIEW. AL: AT THE MOMENT, THEY CALL IT A FIRST DOWN. ALL OF THE REVIEW IS FROM UPSTAIRS. BELICHICK IS LIKE, YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME. IF IT IS NOT A FIRST DOWN, IT WOULD BE THIRD DOWN AND INCHES. AND THEY WOULD NOT START THE KIRK: THE ELLIOTT -- EZEKIEL ELLIOTT TALKS ABOUT THE GAME GOING ON, AND THAT IS WHAT HE DID IN THE EARLY DAYS WITH THE COWBOYS. AL: LOOKS LIKE HE IS DOWN ON THAT SHOT. KIRK: HERE ARE THE NEXT GEN STATS, POWERED BY AWS. PATRIOTS TONIGHT, ENTERING TONIGHT 35%. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT IS NOT QUITE AT 100%. THE CURRENT IS 99.2%. AL: NO MIRACLE AT THE MEADOWLANDS HERE. KIRK: BELICHICK WILL BE OUR CELEBRITY PICKER AND I AM SO EXCITED THAT HE HOPEFULLY WILL BE IN A GOOD MOOD. THE 50 ARMY GAME AT FOX GROVE. AL: I KNOW IF IT IS 99.9%, HE WILL PICK NAVY. GUARANTEED. THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE FAMILY. STEVE AND THE NAVAL ACADEMY. >> AFTER HERE, THE RUNNER WAS SHORT THE LINE ON THE GAME WHEN HE WAS DOWN BY CONTACT. THE TALE OF THE 39 YARD LINE. PLEASE SETS THE GAME CLOCK AT 1:46. THE PLAY CLOCK SHOULD BE SET TO 30 SECONDS IN THE SITUATION. AL: THE PLAY CLOCK GOES TO 30. BEFORE THEY SNAP IT, YOU COULD TAKE IT DOWN TO 1:12 OR SO. THERE YOU GO. 1:36. 30 SECONDS TO GET THE PLAYOFF. DOWN 30 INCHES. THERE FOURTH DOWN WITH A MINUTE. AND THEN THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT WITH IT. THAT IS WHY YOU HAVE -- KIRK: THAT IS MY POINT, HE IS HANGING IN THERE. ONE THING THAT BAILEY IS HAPPY ABOUT TONIGHT, HE AND BRIAN WERE INSANE TONIGHT. THE BALL WAS COMING OUT AND HE HAS THROWN TO ZEKE ELLIOTT OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. THAT IS THEIR STRENGTH. THE RECEIVERS ARE STILL NOT THE THREATS THAT THEY NEED DOWNFIELD , BUT THEY FOUND SOME MATCHUPS THAT THEY LIKED. THEY WERE HITTING THEM EARLY. AL: SO THEY CAN RUN THE CLOCK DOWN HERE. >> TIMEOUT, NEW ENGLAND. THERE FIRST. 30 SECONDS. AL: AND A REMINDER, TO VEGAS WE GO NEXT WEEK. CHARGERS AND RAIDERS ON THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL. WE WILL SEE WHAT ANTONIO PIERCE AND COMPANY HAVE IN STORE. CHARGERS NEEDED THAT WIN ENGLAND DESPERATELY BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOT 6-0. KIRK: THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS, LAS VEGAS A QUICK FLIGHT. LOS ANGELES, JUST HAVE TO WALK. AL: HOW MANY COAST-TO-COAST DO YOU THINK ONE CAN MAKE? YOU HAVE EARNED IT. SETTING UP FOR THE PUSH. THERE YOU HAVE IT. KIRK: HOW COME NOBODY CAN RUN THAT EXCEPT FOR KELSEY AND JALEN HURTS? THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES. AL: SO I THINK HE DOES NOT G KIRK: I THINK HE LOST YARDS. BROWN. KIRK: I WOULD STICK WITH KELSEY. ZERO PUSH. AL: NOTHING. KIRK: THE EAGLES GET THREE YARDS IN THAT PLAY, EVERY TIME. AL: IT IS STILL FOURTH DOWN, AND HERE COMES, WITH THE CLOCK RUNNING DOWN, THEY CAN RUN THE CLOCK DOWN NOW TO ABOUT 20, 21. YOU HAVE GOT -- THIS IS WHY YOU HAVE IT. KIRK: IT WENT THE .9. >> NEW ENGLAND, 30 SECONDS. AL: THE MOST AMAZING THING TONIGHT, 31 POINTS IN THE FIRST HALF, AND YOU KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. KIRK: EVERYBODY COULD TAKE A DEEP BREATH. AL: THEY COULD. [LAUGHTER] KIRK: WE WAITED 30 MINUTES. IT IS OVER, DONE DEAL. I THINK IT WAS THE LOWEST OVER UNDER TOTAL YOU HAVE HAD IN 18 OR 19 YEARS IN THE NFL. NOT THAT ANYBODY PAYS ATTENTION TO IT. JUST INSANE IN TODAY'S WORLD. OK. NOSEDOWN, BALL IN THE AIR. SCHEDULED OUT OF BOUNDS. A FEW SECONDS OFF THAT CLOCK. YOU HAVE GOT 15 SECONDS. SO WHAT DO YOU DO HERE? HAVE GOT THE 15 WAY LATERAL. TOO FAR FOR A HAIL MARY. KIRK: WITH 15 SECONDS, YOU PUT ONE UP TO PICKENS AND YOU HOPE MAYBE FOR EITHER A MIX OF PLAYERS THAT YOU GET A PASS OR INTERFERENCE. IF HE MAKES A PLAY, TRY TO GET HIM OUT OF BOUNDS, OBVIOUSLY. I WOULD JUST TRY TO LOOK FOR THROWING IT AS FAR AS YOU CAN, TRYING TO THROW IT AND GET A PASS INTERFERENCE. TWO RECEIVERS OFF TO THE LEFT. AL: TWO LEFT, TWO RIGHT. THEY GO TO BUY TO -- TWO BY TWO. TRUBISKY FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE. JOHNSON WILL GET THE PASS. DIONTAE JOHNSON WAS SEVEN SECONDS. IS ABLE TO MOVE THE BALL OUT TO THE 36 YARD LINE. KNOWS? KIRK: HE FELL ON HIS ROUTE, GOT BACK UP, CUT THE FOOTBALL -- CAUGHT THE FOOTBALL, AND SOMEHOW GOT ON THE SIDELINES TO GET THAT AL: AGAIN TWO BY TWO.
