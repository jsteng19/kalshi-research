WEATHER, AND AWAY WE GO. MOODY GOT HURT LAST WEEK. HIS OPENING KICK IS A SHORT ONE. HE HAS RUN BACK OUT PAST THE 20. STILL WITH SPEED THROUGH THE 35 YARD LINE. A NICE RUN BACK AFTER A SHORT KICK. HERE COMES GENO SMITH, WHO LEADS THE LEAGUE IN PASSING YARDAGE. 1466, HE'S THROWN FIVE TOUCHDOWN PASSES, ONE IN EACH GAME AT FOUR PICKS, HIS 12TH SEASON, QUITE THE HONESTY FOR SMITH. A FORMER JET, FORMER GIANT, FORMER CHARGER. NOW HE HAS COME INTO HIS OWN IN SEATTLE. KENNETH WALKER WAS THE RUNNING BACK. THEY NEED TO RUN THE BALL MORE THAN THEY DID LAST WEEK. THEY HAD FIVE CARRIES AGAINST THE GIANTS. THEY START RIGHT AWAY WITH HIM. >> THIS KNEE WALL OFFENSIVE SCHEME, NOT ONLY DO THEY HAVE A NEW HEAD COACH OBVIOUSLY, YOU BRING IN SOME NEW COORDINATORS, RYAN IS ACTUALLY THE WASHINGTON HUSKY OFFENSIVE CORDED WHO LED THE MOTHER WOULD'VE THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP, HE TAKES OVER, TALKING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE THIS WEEK IN SAN FRANCISCO ESPECIALLY, THEY SAID YOU WILL GET A LOT OF TEMPLE TONIGHT, A LOT OF COLLEGE OFFENSE SRS HOW FAST THEY CAN GO. -- AS FAR AS HOW FAST THEY CAN GO. IT WILL ALLOW GENO SMITH TO MAKE QUICK THROWS. >> ON THE GROUND AGAIN. BREAKING THE TACKLE. MAKING THE TACKLE ON WALKER. THE SEAHAWKS ARE AVERAGING 40 PASSES PER GAME COMING INTO THIS GAME. >> THAT HAS TO CHANGE. IT'S GREAT THAT GENO SMITH HAS BEEN ABLE TO PUT UP SOME BIG NUMBERS. HE SEEMS TO BE IN COMMAND IN THIS NEW BUT YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE PRESSURE OFF THE OFFENSIVE LINE. ESPECIALLY THE RIGHT SIDE. THE THIRD GUY AT RIGHT TACKLE AND STONE COURTSIDE, BY RUNNING THE BALL YOU CANCEL DOWN BOTH THE -- BOSA AND THE DEFENSE OF PRESSURE. >> THE BACK ON THIRD DOWN. SMITH, LOOKING TO THROW FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND COMPLETE IT, ENTER 40 TERRITORY -- INTO 49ER TERRITORY. OVER THE MIDDLE TO METCALF. THAT'S A GAME AT 30 YARDS. >> THIS IS WHAT THE NINERS LIKE TO DO, PRESSURE USING THE FLOOR. THERE IS BOSA. WATCH HOW HE POPS UP, AVOIDS THE PRESSURE AND GETS METCALF. >> A QUICK HUDDLE. THE 49ERS, MINISTER VARIOUS WARD, THE CORNERBACK. THAT'S A BIG LOSS FOR THEM. THAT WITH A BULKY NEED, INACTIVE TONIGHT. WE'LL SEE A LOT OF GUYS IN HIS PLACE. THERE'S IS A DRAW HERE. HE GETS TO THE 26 YARD LINE. STOPPED BY BROWN. SECOND AND SIX. >> WARD'S ONE OF THE BEST CORNERS IN THE LEAGUE, VERY PHYSICAL, LOOKS DEPRESSED, NOW YOU SEE RENARDO GREEN WHO WILL STEP IN, THEY WILL HAVE TO BE A NICKEL WITH FIVE DEFENSIVE BACKS AND THREE CORNERS OUT THERE, HERE' HERE'S A LOOK AT WARD WHO WILL BE TRY TO HELP GREEN OUT AS MUCH AS HE CAN, BUT ALSO MENORAHS PLAYING THAT NICKEL TONIGHT. >> GREEN HAS JUST COME OUT, BRICKS A TACKLE. AND HE GETS AWAY -- IT GETS AWAY FOR THE MOMENT. ANOTHER THIRD DOWN COMING UP FOR THE SEAHAWKS. >> THE MOST APPRECIATED ASPECT OF NICK BOSA'S GAME IS THIS DANCE IS BEAUTIFUL BUT DEFENDING THE RUN AND SETTING THE EDGE TO THIS DEFENSE, WE ALL KNOW WHAT PASS RUSHER HE IS COME HE LOOKS INTO THE BACKFIELD AND KEEPS A LEVERAGE TO THE DEFENSE, KEEPS THEM FROM GETTING OUTSIDE OF HIM , THAT STRENGTH FORCES HIM BACK INSIDE AND THERE'S THE REST OF THE NINERS DEFENSE ABLE TO CHASE HIM DOWN. >> TRIPS TO THE LEFT THIS TIME. HANDS ON THE POCKET. FIRES. TOO DEEP AND INTERCEPTED AT THE ONE YARD LINE. ALL STOP A IS TAKING THE PLACE OF MOVE -- OF MUSTAFA. A BIG PICK AND AND OVERTHROWN PASS. SAN FRANCISCO TAKES OVER. FIFTH PICK OF THE SEASON FOR GENO SMITH. COME BACK. HE STARTS BY HANDING THE BALL OFF. JORDAN MASON HAS TAKEN OVER MCCAFFREY'S ROLE UNTIL CHRIS KNOW WHEN. >> THE INTERCEPTION WAS BIG, A LOT OF THOSE ROOKIES HAD UP TONIGHT. NICK BOSA GOT THE PRESSURE ON THE PLAY. SOMETIMES IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SAKC, YOU SAW COLLINS ALSO GETTING PRESSURE. THE ROOKIE HAD GREAT TIGHT MAN COVERAGE. THERE'S MUSTAFA WHO STEPS RIGHT IN FRONT OF FOR THE PICK. >> SECOND AND NINE. OFF THE FAKE. PURDY GETS OUT OF THE BACKFIELD AND IS TAKEN DOWN AT THE 12 YARD LINE, LEONARD WILLIAMS IS THERE TO SECURE IT. THIRD DOWN AND TWO FOR SAN FRANCISCO. >> YOU AND I WERE IN THIS STADIUM TWO YEARS AGO, BROCK PURDY HAD JUST TAKEN OVER, EVERYBODY WAS WONDERING, ASSISTANT QUARTERBACK, HOW GOOD COULD HE BE? YEAR, REALLY HAS TAKEN OVER THIS THE BIG YEAR HE HAD A YEAR AGO, HE ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AS A PRESENCE IN THAT SPOT. >> THE LAST GUY PICKED IN THE DRAFT, DANCING AROUND, TRYING TO PICK UP THAT AND DOES, ESCAPING A COUPLE OF TIMES AND A FIRST UP FOR THE 49ERS THEIR OWN 15 YARD LINE. >> THAT'S THE ASPECT OF THIS GAME, WE SAW A LOT OF IT IN COLLEGE AT IOWA STATE, BUT I THINK MORE AND MORE YOU'RE SITTING TO SEE WHAT HE CAN DO, THE DEFENSE IS CONCERNED ABOUT HIM BEING THE DISTRIBUTOR ESPECIALLY ON THIRD DOWN BUT HIS ATHLETIC ABILITY AND STRENGTH IN HIS LOWER BODY ALLOWS HIM TO RUN THROUGH SOME OF THOSE ARM TACKLES TO KNOW WHERE THAT FIRST OUT MARKER WAS. >> HE GOT AWAY FROM JEROME BAKER. HE PICKS UP THE FIRST. RUNNING INTO TRAFFIC BUT STILL KEEPING THOSE LEGS GOING. HANKINS IS THERE. MASON AS A GUY WHO WAS A FREE-AGENT, PLAYED AT GEORGIA COULD HAVE FIGURED THAT HE WOULD COME IN, HE IS THE SECOND LEADING RUSHER I RIGHT NOW. >> IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING STORY, OVER THE YEARS COME YOU THINK ABOUT MIKE SHANAHAN, NOW KYLE SHANAHAN, IT DOESN' TO BE A TOP-FLIGHT RUNNING BACK IN THEIR SYSTEM. HERE'S ANOTHER CHAPTER IN THAT STORY WITH JORDAN MASON AS AN UNDRAFTED FREE AGENT THAT RUNS VERY HARD, VERY PHYSICAL. >> SECOND AND SIX, SAMUEL, FIGHTING, COMES CLOSE TO PICKING UP THE FIRST DOWN. THE 49ERS LOVE A LOT OF MOTION. THEY LOVE A LOT OF EYE CANDY. THAT ILLUSTRATION, RIGHT THERE. >> SAMUEL HAS ALWAYS BEEN INVOLVED IN THE RUN GAME BUT WITH MCCAFFREY STILL DOWN, MASON, AS MUCH AS WE ARE BRAGGING ABOUT WHAT HE'S DONE, HE'S A VERY DIFFERENT STYLE OF RUNNER FROM CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY. OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TO LEAN MORE ON SAMUEL TO BE THAT GADGET GUY TO BE ABLE TO GET YOU SOME JETS BEAT AND REVERSES AND THINGS OF IN HIS HANDS. >> HE RUSHED 16 TIMES THIS 17 RECEPTIONS. THIRD AND ONE. PURDY FIRES, OPEN, JUGGLING, TAKEN DOWN IS SAMUEL. HE RUNS FOR A FEW TO SET UP A THIRD AND ONE CATCH AS THIS ONE. BOBBLED IT. HE HAS TO COME UP FOR THE MOMENT. >> HOW ABOUT THE CALL BY SHANAHAN? DEEPENING YOUR OWN TERRITORY. THEY ARE GOING TO RUN THE BALL, KNOW THEY ARE NOT, NOT WITH KYLE SHANAHAN. WHAT AN EFFORT THERE BY SAMUEL TO GET HIS RIGHT HAND UP AND GET IT ABLE TO POSITION IT IN FRONT OF HIM AND HAUL IT IN FOR THAT FIRST DOWN. A GREAT CALL AGAIN BY SHANAHAN. >> TOSSED BACK. NICE P THERE GOES MASON. INSIDE THE 40. HE CAN'T GET IT. AT THE VERY END, HE'S TAKEN DOWN AFTER A GREAT BLOG EARLY ON BY TRENT WILLIAMS -- BLOCK EARLY ON BY TRENT WILLIAMS. >> THIS IS SAN FRANCISCO FOOTBALL RIGHT HERE, THEY TAKE IT TO THE OUTSIDE. WATCH BANKS ALSO. THE LEFT SIDE DOES A GOOD ON THE SWEEP, GETTING OUTSIDE, LETTING HIM READ THAT ON HIS THIRD STEP, HE GETS NORTH AND SOUTH AND THAT'S WHERE THE PHYSICALITY COMES IN, WITH HIM COMING DOWNHILL LIKE THAT, THAT IS A HANDFUL, BIG PHYSICAL BACK, 225 POUNDER. >> TIGHT FORMATION HERE, SAMUEL LINES UP AS THE EYE BACK. HE TAKES IT. THROUGH THE MIDDLE HE GOES. TO THE 23 YARD GEORGE KITTLE, LAYING IN LINE AND THAT ONE, MAKING THE BLOG. SECOND DOWN. >> WE TALKED ABOUT TRENT WILLIAMS AND BANKS, YOU CANNOT FORGET ABOUT 85 AND WHAT HE DOES. WHAT A BLOCK, JUST PANCAKES YOU. I'M SURE HE HAD A FEW WORDS OUT THERE ON THE FIELD. GEORGE KITTLE, KIND OF A UNICORN IN THIS ERA OF TIGHT ENDS. THERE'S KELCE OUT THERE, SUCH A TALENTED RECEIVER AS A TIGHT END. BUT KITTLE IS AN OLD-SCHOOL GUY. YOU CAN ALSO MA THE PERIMETER. >> CAN'T THINK OF ANYONE WHO LOVES TO PLAY THE GAME MORE THAN GEORGE KITTLE. P, ESCAPING AGAIN -- PURDY, ESCAPING AGAIN, THROWING. TO THE 10 YARD LINE GOES JENNINGS, WHO HAS EMERGED THIS SEASON. JENKINS MAKES THE TACKLE. THAT WILL SPOT THE 10 YARD LINE, THEY GET A FIRST ANGLE AND A DRIVE THAT STARTED BA OWN THREE. >> WHAT A JOB HERE WORKING WITH THE QUARTERBACK, WITH PURDY AND HIS ABILITY TO TAKE OFF, LOOKS LIKE HE WENT BACK TO THE MIDDLE, JENNINGS THERE, LOOKING TRYING TO FIND A LINEBACKERS, HE'S SITTING IN THAT SOFT SPOT WHERE PURDY CAN FINE HIM, IS ABOUT TO GIVE UP ON THE PLAY AND FINDS 15 FOR ANOTHER BIG PLAY. WHAT A DRIVE BY THE NINERS. >> NINE PLAYS, SEVEN RUSHERS, HERE'S THE ACE, HERE'S TO THE SIX YARD LINE HERE GOES -- HE GOES. 4:40 T QUARTER. >> WE WERE ABOUT WHAT TO WE THINK OF THIS GAME AND ALL THE >> ONE THING WE KNEW FOR CERTAIN WAS THE 49ERS WOULD COME IN HERE WITH SOME URGENCY. LOSING LAST WEEK THE WAY THEY DID, A COUPLE TOUGH LOSSES. ON THE ROAD ON A SHORT WEEK. YOU KNEW THAT PART OF IT, AND BOY, THEY HAVE REALLY SET THE TONE HERE IF THEY CAN PUNCH THIS INTO THE END ZONE. AL: A GUT WRENCHING LOSS IN THEIR HOME BUILDINGS LAST SUNDAY. SECOND AND GOAL. PRETTY UNDER PRESSURE. COVERAGE -- HE IS UNDER BAKER IS BACK. THE SEVENTH YEAR LINEBACKER OUT OF OHIO STATE. THIRD DOWN AND GOAL. THE 49ERS, YOU'RE RIGHT. THEY WOULD BE TWO GAMES BEHIND SEATTLE IF THEY LOSE AND BY THE WAY, THEIR NEXT GAME, A WEEK FROM SUNDAY, KANSAS CITY. THIRD AND GOAL. DECIMAL LEVEL IN THREE FIGURES. TO THE END ZONE, ALL KINDS OF ACTION. DEEBO SAMUEL IS THERE. HE WAS JUST ACTIVATED TONIGHT. COMING IN AND THEY ARE MINUS ONE OF THEIR TOP BACKS. HE IS THE GUY TAKING THE SPOT AND MAKE A BIG PLAY HERE. GREAT JOB COMMUNICATING WITH A CORNER WHO HAS NOT PLAYED A LOT OF FOOTBALL. DEEBO SAMUEL LINES THE INSIDE, JUST TRYING TO CONFUSE SEATTLE BUT ABLE TO PASS IT OFF. BURNS WAS RIGHT THERE IN TIGHT GREAT JOB. >> MOODY GOT HURT LAST WEEK. THEY HAVE FOUR GUYS COME IN AND MATTHEW WRIGHT WHO HAS BEEN 49ER IS GOOD TO PUT THE FIRST POINTS OF THE GAME ON THE BOARD. 3:58 TO GO INSHARPIE IN THE SOCK BIG SCORE AS WELL, LEADING THEM TO A VICTORY. IT WAS GOING TO BE RETURNABLE AND IT IS RETURNABLE NOW. TO THE 10 YARD LINE, IT BOUNCED A ROOKIE FROM TENNESSEE IT OUT. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT BOSA. KIRK: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR STATS, POWERED BY AWS. KEEP AN EYE ON 97, THIRD DOWN SPIRIT .67 IS HIS AVERAGE TAKEOFF, THE QUICKEST IN THE HE GETS DOWN IN THAT STANCE. WE SAW IT IN THE OPENING DRIVE, FORCED THE QUICK PASS BY SMITH THAT LED TO THE INTERCEPTION. AL: HIS SIXTH YEAR OUT OF OHIO STATE, GREAT GOING NOWHERE. KENNETH WALKER -- WHAT DOES IT TWO THIRDS OF A SECOND. PEOPLE GO A SECOND MISSISSIPPI. SO WHAT IS THAT? KIRK: THAT IS ABOUT ALL YOU GET. AL: NO-HUDDLE HERE. THERE GOES WALKER AND HE GETS TAKEN DOWN BEFORE HE CAN PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN ABOUT TWO YARDS SHIVE. KENNETH WALKER TAKING IT OUT TO THE 18 YARD LINE. THIRD DOWN AND TWO. KIRK: FINALLY, THERE IS SOME ROOM TO WORK. IT HAS BEEN TOUGH FOR KENNETH WALKER THIS YEAR AND A BIG HIT BY THE ROOKIE COMING UP THERE, KEEPING HIM SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN. >> HE ALREADY HAD THE PICK. THERE HE IS AGAIN. THE TWO ROOKIES ON THE SECONDARY THE 49ERS BRING PRESSURE HERE. THEY DON'T. JUST A FOUR MAN RASH. THE PAST INTO A LOT OF TRAFFIC PULLED IN BY THE TIGHT END, NOAH SAM. KIRK: THAT IS TOUGH AGAINST WARNER. ALWAYS A TIGHT WINDOW. GOING UP AGAINST 54 WHO IS AS GOOD AS THERE IS IN COVERAGE. HE IS SHOWING A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE AND THEN GETS OUT. HE WILL MOVE OVER THERE. A GOOD JOB OF THROWING THE BALL AWAY TO THE OUTSIDE SHOULDER BY GENO SMITH AND AWAY FROM 54. >> THE EXTRA MAN COMES. TAKEN OUT OF THE PLAY. THE PASS TO THE OUTSIDE. NOTHING THERE. METCALF, DOUBLE COVERAGE. TWO MINUTES TO GO IN THE >> RUNNING THE FOOTBALL, A LOT OF DIFFERENT FORMATIONS, TRYING TO MAKE THIS SAN FRANCISCO DEFENSE HAVE TO THINK THAT TIME WITH TWO TIGHT ENDS, THEY WERE SHOWING THE WAY THEY HAVE BEEN RUNNING THE BALL. FIRST AND 10, THEY ARE GOING TO RUN THE FOOTBALL. PLAY-ACTION. TRY THE NINERS NAPPING A BIT AND GO WITH TIGHT COVERAGE ON METCALF. AL: THERE IS THE PLAYER LINING UP A WIDE. TAKE HIM OUT OF THE PLAY. THE PAST IS INCOMPLETE HERE, TRYING TO GO HIS WAY. HE KNOCKED IT DOWN, THIRD AND 10. >> HE IS -- ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT HIM EARLY IN HIS CAREER, HE USED HIS HANDS WELL AND LATELY, SEEMS LIKE HE' LATELY, SEEMS LIKE HE'S USING HIS BODY. THAT WAS A BALL THAT MAY BE GET TOUCHED BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A BALL TO HIT BOTH HIS HANDS. I AM SURE HE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE BROUGHT THAT ONE IN. >> SPLIT THEM OUT TO THE RIGHT. THE THIRD DOWN BACK IN THE BACKFIELD. ALONG WITH THE TIGHT END. THEY BOTH GO OUT AND THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE ON -- A LOT OF WHITE JERSEYS AROUND METCALF. HE HAD A CROWD ON HIS FOURTH WHAT'S PRETTY GOOD JOB ON THE RIGHT SIDE BY FORSYTH, GIVING GENO SMITH ENOUGH TIME. JUST THEY'RE JUST IN CASE TO HELP OUT. THE CROWD IS REACTING TO THE SAME THING METCALF REACTED TO. BEFORE HE GOT TO THE TOP OF THEIR OUT, THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A GRAB AROUND THE HIP. >> MICHAEL DICKSON, ONE OF THE BEST IN THE LEAGUE. SKYWARD. SLIPS. THERE WAS METCALF GETTING ON THE PHONE. WHAT IS GOING ON DOWN HERE? FROM THE 24 YARD LINE, THE 49ERS HAVE THE BALL. ALMOST GETS THE FIRST. HE IS A YARDS SHIVE, SECOND AND JENKINS MAKES THE STOP. KAYLEE: TO PARAPHRASE, METCALF IS TELLING THE SIDELINE HE DOESN'T NEED ANY POSITIVE WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT. HE IS OVER THE PEP TOP SPEED -- PEP TALKS. AL: IT WENT OVER THREE TIMES ON THAT DRIVE. FRUSTRATION. SECOND AND ONE. THIS TIME, HE GETS STOPPED. TERREL DODSON CAME OVER FROM BUFFALO. >> IF YOU WATCH THE GIANTS LAST WEEK, THEY RAN THE BALL REALLY WELL ASKED WEEK AGAINST HIS DEFENSE AND HE WAS TALKING THIS WEEK TO MIKE MACDONALD WHO CALLS THE DEFENSE AS A HEAD COACH. IT IS ALMOST LIKE HE TOOK IT ON HIMSELF BECAUSE HE TAKES A LOT OF PRIDE IN BEING PART OF THAT UNIT. HE SAID THAT BALL IS ON ME AND I GOT TO MAKE SURE MY GUYS KNOW THE CAUSE AND WE COMMUNICATE. WE HAVE TO GET OFF BLOCKS. SO FAR, DOING A GOOD JOB IN THE INTERIOR, MUCH BETTER THAN THEY DID A WEEK AGO. AL: DECIBEL LEVEL, 101. IT IS BROKEN UP. JULIAN LOVE KNOCKED IT DOWN, FORCED DOWN, 49ERS TO KICK. >> YOU KNOW, NICE LOVE. WHEN KITTLE MOVED FROM THE RIGHT TO THE LEFT, HE WAS BACK HERE AND HE JUST KIND OF WALKS DOWN. NOW, HE IS IN POSITION TO TAKE HIM. IT IS A HECK BATTLE. MADE IT EASY. NICE JOB BEING IN POSITION. >> MITCH HAVE TO COME IN AND KICK LAST WEEK THROUGHOUT THE FIRST FLAG OF THE GAME. HOW ABOUT THAT? PLAYED 14 MINUTES AND 41 SECONDS AND WE WILL HEAR FROM CRAIG WROLSTAD FOR THE FIRST TIME >> OFFENSE. NUMBER 50. THE FIVE YARD PENALTY STILL GOES >> LAST -- AL: LAST WEEK, WHEN HE GOT HURT, HAD TO COME AND GET AN EXTRA POINT BUT THAT REALLY FACTORED INTO THE STRATEGY OF THAT GAME, NOT HAVING A GUY THE FIELD GOAL. KIRK: FOURTH AND 23. AL: HE DID NOT HAVE TO, BUT HE DID. FAIR CALL AT THE LAST SECOND BY WILLIAMS. AL: WANING SECONDS OF THE QUARTER, WIDE LEFT. A COUPLE OF PIECES AROUND. WALKER IS THE RUNNING BACK. GENO SMITH HANDS IT TO HIM. HE WILL TAKE IT TO THE 31. FRED WARNER MAKES THE TACKLE AND THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE SECOND THE END OF THE FIRST, SAN FRANCISCO 3, SEATTLE 0, ON THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL. OVER A BEAUTIFUL SHOT OF THE STADIUM, DOWNTOWN SEATTLE. WE GO TO LOUISIANA NEXT WEEK. IT WILL BE THE BRONCOS AND THE SAINTS ON THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL. SEAN PAYTON RETURNING TO THE BIG EASY, NEXT THURSDAY NIGHT. WE START THE SECOND QUARTER. A HANDOFF HERE TO THE OUTSIDE, TURNING THE CORNER. AND PICKING UP ABOUT FOUR IS KENNETH WALKER, THIRD DOWN. KIRK: THIS SEATTLE OFFENSE LAST WEEK IN THE GIANTS GAME, IT WAS AN UNUSUAL GAME BUT THE RUNNING BACK POSITION ONLY HAD SEVEN CARRIES. FIVE FOR KENNETH WALKER, TWO FOR THE OTHER AND IN THIS FIRST HALF ALREADY, WE ARE SEEING A MUCH MORE DETERMINED PLAY CALLER GETTING THE BALL INTO THESE HANDS. AT SOME POINT, YOU GOT TO FEEL WHAT A GREAT MATCHUP WITH JACKSON SMITH IN THAT SLOT. AL: THIRD AND THREE. WALKER, AND IT IS BUSTED OUT BEFORE HE CAN PICK UP THE FIRST FRED WARNER, SEVENTH YEAR, BYU, WHAT A GUY, A GUY WHO HAS MISSED ONLY ONE GAME PLAYING MIDDLE LINEBACKER IN SEVEN SEASONS. KIRK: WATCH THE INSTINCTS. HE FEELS THIS SCREEN RIGHT AWAY. HE'S GOT TO GET BETWEEN THOSE LINEMEN WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT HE DID AND THEN HIT A REALLY TALENTED BACK AND HE DOESN'T LET HIM GET THE FIRST DOWN. WHAT A PLAY. AL: SECOND. TOWARD THE SIDELINE, BOUNCES OUT OF BOUNDS INSIDE THE 25 YARD LINE. THE DAY MCDONALD GETS AMASSED AS THE HEAD COACH ON JANUARY 31. >> GREAT THING ABOUT WHAT MIKE MACDONALD IS DOING, HE LEARNED A LOT FROM THEM BUT HE IS KEEPING AT HIS OWN WAY OF DOING IT HERE IN SEATTLE, UTILIZING THE TOOLS THAT THEY TAUGHT HIM BUT GIVING IT HIS OWN PERSONALITY. AL: WIDE OPEN, MAKING SAMUEL -- THE TACKLE IS MISSED. OFF TO THE END ZONE. TOUCHDOWN, 49ERS. 76 YARDS. GOT FREE, BROKE A TACKLE, SPUN AWAY. OFF HE GOES TO THE RACES. KIRK: GREAT JOB HERE UTILIZING THE RECEIVER. TAKES THE CORNER WITH HIM. SAFETY GETS OVERLAID, TAKES A CHANCE RIGHT THERE BY TRYING TO -- ALMOST MISSED HIM WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GO EITHER FOR THE FOOTBALL OR HIT DEEBO SAMUEL BUT THAT IS A TOUGH THING TO DO AN OPEN SPACE BUT THE DESIGN OF THAT OPENPLAY, THE FOREIGNER -- CORNER FOLLOWED HIM TO THE OUTSIDE AND NOBODY IS THERE ON SAMUEL. >> EXTRA POINT IS GOOD. 1:30 INTO THE SECOND QUARTER, THE 49ERS ARE UP 10-0 ON THE ROAD. NOW FOR THE THURSDAY NIGHT SPOTLIGHT, PRESENTED BY POPEYES. WELL-DESIGNED PLAY AGAIN. YOU TAKE HIM INTO THE INSIDE CORNER, GOES WITH HIM. WATCH THE SLIGHT HESITATION. ALMOST GOES ON A RAIL ROUTE DOWN THE SIDELINE. NOBODY PICKS HIM UP. THE BALL WAS THROWN BACK WHICH IS A GREAT JOB BY PURDY. COULD MAYBE GET A HAND ON IT AND WATCH BROCK PURDY SETTLE MOVEMENT IN THE POCKET, FEEL, LOCATION, PERFECT. SAMUEL FIGHTS BACK TO THE FOOTBALL AND THE NINERS, WHO HAD 20 COMPLETIONS OF 20 YARDS OR MORE WHICH IS TIED FOR THE MOST WITH THE PACKERS. THEY HIT ANOTHER ONE FOR A BIG SCORE. >> RUN IT BACK HERE. HE HAD A GOOD RUN ON THE OPENING HERE. THE BALL IS LOOSE. 49ERS HAVE IT. HERE COME THE OFFICIALS WHO HAS GOT IT? SAN FRANCISCO. >> THAT IS A BIG QUESTION. WAS HE DOWN WHEN THE BALL CA OUT? I MEAN, HE WAS GOING TOWARDS THE SURFACE. DID THEY GET A HAND ON IT BEFORE HE TOUCHES THE GROUND? IT IS OUT. THE BALL CAME OUT BEFORE THAT RIGHT KNEE HIT. AL: DARRELL TAYLOR MAKES THE CONTACT -- HE MAKES THE CONTACT. WITH THE RECOVERY. THE BALL IS COMING OUT RIGHT THERE. JUST BEFORE THE KNEE HITS, MUCH TO THE DISPLEASURE OF THE CROWD, LOOKING AT THE REPLAY, AND NOW, THE 49ERS ALREADY UP BY 10. THE RULING IS CONFIRMED. TAKE OVER THE 29 YARD LINE. SECOND AND FULLBACK. MASON TO THE -- I'M LOOKING AT PROPERTY AND EVERYBODY SAYS, YOU KNOW, HE HAS A GREAT SYSTEM AND A GREAT COACH. MEANWHILE, HE LED THE LEAGUE IN YARDS PER PASS LAST YEAR. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY A LOT OF YARDS AFTER CONTACT HE IS PRETTY GOOD. >> HE IS A GREAT EXTENSION OF KYLE SHANAHAN. KYLE SHANAHAN, THEY TOOK A CHANCE ON HIM. THEY TOOK A CHANCE ON HIM BECAUSE OF ALL THE WORK THAT THEY DID LEADING INTO THE DRAFT. HE IS A PERFECT FIT FOR WHAT THEY DO. AL: VERY EVEN KEEL GUY. HE'S GOT SOME EXTENSION NEXT YEAR. MEANWHILE, HE FIGHTS HIS WAY -- HE IS UNDER $1 MILLION, RIGHT? DAK PRESCOTT IS A MILLION DOLLARS. >> IS THINK HE WILL DO OK. AL: I THINK KYLE SHANAHAN TOLD US -- THE BIGGEST THING YOU CAN SAY ABOUT HIM IS HE IS JUST COMFORTABLE IN HIS OWN SKIN AND WHO HE IS AS A PERSON. FORGET ABOUT FOOTBALL. EVERYTHING ABOUT THE WAY HE CARRIES HIMSELF, HE DOES NOT REALLY GET CAUGHT UP IN ALL THE NOISE OR TRYING TO PROVE PEOPLE WRONG. HE'S TRYING TO STUDY THIS FILM AND GET BETTER IN THIS OFFENSE. >> 81ST HIGHEST-PAID QUARTERBACK IN THE LEAGUE. LOOK OUT. SCRAMBLES AWAY. AVOIDS A BIG-TIME SACK AND THEN FIRES IT OUT OF BOUNDS, FOURTH A LOT OF YARDAGE ON THE PLAY. >> IN FRONT OF HIM, CHASING, AND THAT IS WHERE THE CONTACT WAS. HE MADE CONTACT BUT YOU KNOW, BROCK PURDY, LIKE ANY SMART QUARTERBACK, AS SOON AS YOU GET TOUCHED, YOU JUST FALL, WHETHER YOU GET HIT HARD OR NOT. NO FOUL AND A GOOD STUFF BY THE SEAHAWKS THERE. >> HERE COMES THE NEW KICKER. HE THREW IT AWAY. SCOTT ALSO HAD A GREAT ONE FOR TODAY. THE 49ERS ONLY HOPE HIS NICKNAME WAS NOT THAT. MATTHEW RIGHT, 41 YARDNOT FAR FR SEATTLE ON A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT. NOT SO BEAUTIFUL FOR THE SEAHAWKS TO THIS POINT. NINERS ON TOP, 13-0. HE IS BACK TO RECEIVE THE KICK ALONG WITH WILLIAMS WHO HAD THE FUMBLE. AND THIS T HIS CAREER IS JUST GOING TO BE AS A BACKUP. HE GETS THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN RUSSELL LEADS AND TONIGHT, THEY GOT METCALF INVOLVED BUT THEY HAVE NOT THROWN THE FOOTBALL AT ALL TO JACKSON SMITH. AL: NOT YET. THEY GO NOWHERE HERE. 49ERS, SO TOUGH AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. HAVING A HECK OF A NIGHT ALREADY ALONG WITH ROBERT DEAL. SECOND AND 13. >> GOOD JOB THERE. A LITTLE TEMPO. GET THE NINERS DEFENSE A IT ON THEIR HEELS. >> IT IS OFFICIAL. AL: MOVING GUYS ALL OVER THE PLACE HERE. GOING TO THE RIGHT SIDE, IN THE SLOT. HE'S GOING TO TAKE OFF AND SLIDES TO A STOP WITH THE FLAG PRONET THE 35 YARD LINE. >> HOLDING OFFENSE. NUMBER 67. FIVE YARD PENALTY. 10 YARD PENALTY, SECOND DOWN. AL: THAT IS CHARLES CROSS. THE FIRST ROUND OUT OF MISSISSIPPI STATE IN 2022. KIRK: I THINK THEY SAID 67 BUT CONNOR WILLIAMS ACTUALLY WAS THE GUILTY PARTY. THE LEFT TACKLE WAS FINE ON THE CONNOR WILLIAMS MOVED TO THE INSIDE AND HE JUST GRABS ON. AL: HE WAS LOOKING UP AT THE BOARD GOING, HUH? HE TAKES THE BALL OUT TO SECOND AND 23. NOW, THIRD DOWN AND EIGHT. KIRK: THIS DEFENSE SO FAR HAS DONE A HECKUVA JOB. GOT A LOT OF INJURIES BUT THEY ARE DOING A GOOD JOB OF TRYING TO GET THIS OFFENSE IN OBVIOUS PASSING SITUATIONS. AL: QUICKLY AGAIN, SMITH. TOO HIGH AGAIN AND THAT PASS IS INCOMPLETE. KIRK: BOSA MOVING THERE. >> DEFENSE, NUMBER 97. THIRD DOWN. KIRK: TRYING TO GET THAT BIG START. WE TALKED ABOUT .67, THE QUICKEST JUMP. THIS IS EVEN QUICKER THAN THAT RIGHT HERE, GOES BEFORE THE BALL IS SNAPPED. GENO SMITH HAD THE FREE PLAY AND THROWS IT HIGH TO GIVE THIS GUY A CHANCE. TAKE THE FIVE YARD. AL: IT WAS SECOND AND 23, BUT NOW, IT IS THIRD AND THREE. EARLY IN THE SECOND QUARTER, THE NINERS REALIGNED THEIR SECONDARY AS THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE. NOT EVEN CLOSE THAT TIME. HE IS OFF THE MARK. HE IS FOUR OF NINE TONIGHT FOR 53 YARDS AND ANOTHER POND. KIRK: IT IS JUST THE REPUTATION OF A GUY LIKE NICK BOSA WHO CAN AFFECT THE QUARTERBACK. WATCH HOW HE FALLS OFF THIS THROW, KIND OF FALLS BACK. HE DID NOT GET ANYTHING INTO THAT AND I THINK IT AFFECTED HIS ACCURACY. AL: IT'S A BEAUTY. THE SIX YARD LINE. THE 49ERS WILL TAKE OVER AT THAT SPOT WITH 10:16 LEFT FIRST HALF. METCALF TONIGHT HAS TARGETED ONLY FOUR TIMES, ONLY ONE CATCH. KIRK: EASY ROUTE UNDERNEATH. IT WAS WIDE OPEN AND SO FAR, EARLY IN THE GAME, GENO SMITH IS KIND OF A STREAKY QUARTERBACK. THERE WILL BE MOMENTS IF YOU CAN MAKE HIM FEEL THAT RUSH, HE IS JUST NOT THE SAME GUY BUT IF HE HAS A CLEAN POCKET, HE IS AS EFFICIENT AS ANYBODY AND RIGHT NOW, RYAN TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO GET HIM INTO THAT RHYTHM. AL: THERE HE IS. NOTHING LIKE CHANGING A JOB. YOU KEEP YOUR HOUSE AND STAY IN THE SAME TOWN. UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON. THE DRIVE BEGINS AT THE SIX YARD GOOD PROTECTION. THE THROW IS CAUGHT. KIDDO. I 11 YARD LINE. DODSON MAKING THE TACKLE THERE. KIRK: QUESTION TONIGHT WAS GOING TO BE HOW WOULD THE MIDDLE, THE SECOND LEVEL, THE SEE DEFENSE DO AGAINST KITTLE AND SAMUEL? YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE 49ERS LIKE TO RUN THE BALL AND THEN THEY LIKE THAT PLAY ACTION AND THE ROUTES. AT SOME POINT, YOU KNOW, THAT WILL BE COMING IN RIGHT BEHIND ZERO AND 17. AL: SECOND AND THREE. THERE HE GOES AGAIN UP TO THE 27 YARD LINE BEHIND A BLOCK BY AARON BANKS. ALREADY TONIGHT EIGHT CARRIES, 65, AND HE IS DOWN AND BACK UP WOULD BE PATRICK TAYLOR. THEY HAVE ISAAC THERE AS WELL. HE GOES OVER TO HAVE A LOOK AS DOES TRENT WILLIAMS. THERE IS THE ROOKIE OUT OF LOUISVILLE. PICKED HIM IN THE FOURTH ROUND. TAYLOR IS THE OTHER BACK. THIS WOULD BE SERIOUS FOR THE 49ERS MCCAFFREY, IT IS UNKNOWN EXACTLY WHEN HE CAN COME BUT HE DOES GET UP AND IS ASSISTED OVER TO THE SIDELINE. BACK AFTER THIS. MASON. THEY WANT TO TAKE HIM BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM SO HE WILL GO BACK THERE. AND WHILE, HE WILL COME IN. NOW FOR THE MOMENT, LEADING THE NFL IN RUSHING. HE'S GOT THE ONE EXTRA HALF GAME AT THIS POINT. MOVE AHEAD TO DERRICK HENRY AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT. YOU HAVE THE ROOKIE OUT OF LOUISVILLE IN THE BACKFIELD. FIRST AND 10 FROM THE 27 YARD HERE HE GOES FOR A GAIN OF THREE. HE MAKES THE TACKLE. KAYLEE: JORDAN MASON HAS JUST GONE INTO THE X-RAY ROOM. WE ARE TOLD THE ISSUE IS HIS LEFT SHOULDER AND HE IS QUESTIONABLE TO RETURN. KIRK: HE THINK ABOUT CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY OF COURSE, ELIJAH MITCHELL, DOWN TO JORDAN MASON, AND HE IS OUT HERE AND ALL THE WEIGHT COMES DOWN ON THE SHOULDER HE IS IN NOW. MAKES YOU WONDER IF DEEBO SAMUEL MIGHT GET A FEW MORE CARRIES TONIGHT, RUNNING BACK THERE. AL: I WOULD BET ON IT. FIRED OVER THE MIDDLE. BRANDON AIYUK MAKES HIS FIRST GRAB OF THE NIGHT. HIS FIRST TARGET OF THE NIGHT. KIRK: TALKED ABOUT THE LINEBACKERS WHEN YOU RUN THE YOU HAVE TO RESPECT IT AND GET DOWNHILL AND LOOK AT THE THROWING LANE RIGHT OVER TOP OF DODSON. WE TALKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGE ON THE EYES. LOOK AT THE RHYTHM THEY ARE OFF THE PLAY ACTION. PERFECTLY THROWN. AL: THAT IS SAMUEL LINING UP. JENNINGS TO THE OUTSIDE. THE SIGN OFF THE THROW IS CAUGHT AT THE 40 YARD LINE. AND SEVEN. KIRK: THE DEFENDER IS RIGHT IN HIS FACE AND LOWERS THE ARM ANGLE AND GOES RIGHT AROUND HIM. HE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO GO OVER TOP OF HIM. PRETTY GOOD JOB BY WITHERSPOON DAY WHO IS MOVING AROUND HIMSELF TONIGHT BECAUSE OF THE INJURIES THAT SEATTLE HAS. AL: METCALF, ANOTHER HAPPY CAMPER AT THE MOMENT. PRETTY BAD. SAMUEL IN THE BACKFIELD. HE FLARES OUT. HE'S GOING TO RUN. HE DOES NOT GET ENOUGH CREDIT FOR WHAT HE DOES RUNNING TO THE 40 YARD LINE. KIRK: AS IF IT IS NOT HARD ENOUGH TO DEFEND KYLE SHANAHAN'S OFFENSE, NOW, YOU GOT TO WORRY ABOUT THIS? YOU HAVE JENNINGS AND KITTLE AND EVERYBODY RUNNING AROUND. YOU GOT EVERYBODY COVERED. YOU HAVE DONE YOUR JOB. HERE COMES 13. TAKE IT HOME. THAT IS A LOT TO DEAL WITH FOR ANY DEFENSE. YOU ARE RIGHT. PEOPLE DO NOT LOOK AT THAT ASPECT OF HIS GAME WITH HIS LEGS. HE IS A GREAT ATHLETE. AL: THE PLAYER BACK IN. THE 49ERS HAVE ALREADY GAINED 234 YARDS IN THIS HALF. KIRK: A GUY WHO IS PLAYING PRETTY WELL FOR THIS DEFENSE. HE AND DERICK HALL, BOTH KNOWN AS PASS RUSHERS. BOTH WERE QUESTIONABLE. BOTH ARE OUT THERE. FIVE SACKS ON THE YEAR FOR MCDONALD. AL: SECOND AND NINE. SAMUEL, DOWN THE CORNER HE GOES, PICKS UP ABOUT FIVE THERE. TRENT WILLIAMS LEADING THE WAY. THAT IS QUITE A CONVOY. KIRK: HE USED THE MOTION GOING THE OTHER WAY. IT DOES AFFECT THE EYES OF THE DEFENSE, TRYING TO SLOW HIM DOWN AND YOU HAVE WILLIAMS OUT OF THE CORNER. PRETTY GOOD JOB BY THE DEFENSE. STRETCHED OUT PLAY OUT TO THE SIDELINE. AL: THIRD AND FIVE. A LITTLE OVER FIVE MINUTES TO PLAY IN THE HALF. JENNINGS MAKING THAT -- WHAT A DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES. LAST CHRISTMAS, THEY PICK HIM OFF FOUR TIMES BUT A DIFFERENT STORY TONIGHT SO FAR. KIRK: DIFFERENT STORY. THE TIMING OF THAT THROW, HE DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO HAVE ONE MORE HITCH. THE BALL IS GOING TO BE THROWN ON THE LINE. LOOK AT THE ACCURACY ON THE THIRD DOWN THROW TO JENNINGS FOR THE FIRST DOWN. AL: 38 OUT OF 12. 142 AND A TOUCHDOWN. THE END OF THE PLAY. HE WILL TELL US. >> PERSONAL FOUL. DEFENSE, NUMBER 55. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. AL: THAT IS THE LINEBACKER, DREAMLAND JONES. >> RIGHT AS HE WAS MAKING THE INITIAL,, AGAINST -- HE GETS HIS LEFT HAND IN AND TAKES IT DOWN. REMEMBER, A BIG THING FOR SAN FRANCISCO HAS BEEN THEY WILL BUILD LEADS AND THEY DON' BUILD LEADS AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO FINISH. THEY GET INTO THE RED ZONE AND SETTLE FOR FIELD GOALS. LAST WEEK, THEY LOSE THE ARIZONA DID NOT CLOSE IT OFF. ONE OF SIX IN THE RED ZONE AS FAR AS TOUCHDOWNS. LET'S SEE IF THEY CAN FINISH THIS DRIVE. AL: SAME THING HAPPENED THREE WEEKS AGO. THIS TIME, STUFFED AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. MENARD WILLIAMS. >> A BIG PART OF THAT. WE TALKED WITH BOTH KYLE SHANAHAN AND BROCK PURDY. HE PUT IT ON HIMSELF. I GOT TO BE MORE DECISIVE AND AGGRESSIVE. KYLE SHANAHAN TALKED ABOUT IF 23 IS BACK THERE, IT IS ALWAYS A DIFFERENT GAME ON HOW HE ATTACKED IN THE RED ZONE AREA. THEY ARE NOT GOING EXCUSES. THEY WILL TRY AND FIND WAYS TO RUN THE BALL BETTER AND SUSTAIN BLOCKS. HIT THE TIGHT WINDOWS. >> PATRICK TAYLOR, HE IS 32. THE PASS FROM SAMUEL IS NO GOOD AND ALREADY, BURNS COVERS. THIRD DOWN AND 11. 3:16 UNTIL HALFTIME. >> WITH HOW THIS GAME FEELS, THIS IS A BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR SHANAHAN AND ALSO A HUGE, HUGE DEFENSIVE STAND HERE FOR THE SEAHAWKS. GET DOWN 20 TELL -- IT IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING. DOWN 16. AL: THIRD AND 11. BIG PLAY BY JEROME BAKER RIGHT THEY HOLD HIM TO A FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT. KIRK: HE HAS TO BEAT AARON BANKS. WATCH OUT. HE HAS GOT TO BEAT THIS GUY RIGHT HERE TO GET OUT THERE. FEELS IT, SEES IT. HE HAS GOT A WIN. GETS RIGHT IN FRONT OF BANKS. GOOD JOB OF RECOGNIZING THAT AND BEING ABLE TO QUICKLY GET INTO THE FACE OF SUPPLIER. AL: 35 YARD ATTEMPT FOR MATTHEW RIGHT. HE HAS BEEN GOOD TONIGHT. AND HE IS GOOD AGAIN. HE HAS MADE THREE FIELD GOALS AN EXTRA POINT SO FAR POINT. SO FAR, SO GOOD. >> HE IS IN FLORIDA. LIVING IN THE TAMPA AREA. THEY KNOW THE HURRICANE IS COMING IN AND THEY WERE GOING TO GET OUT OF THERE ANYWAY AND THEN GETS THE CALL FROM THE 49ERS, WINS THE AUDITION, AND SO FAR, SO GOOD TONIGHT. KIRK: IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A FRATERNITY OF GUYS LIKE THAT. ONE CALL AWAY IF A GUY GETS INTO A FUNK, THE GUY GETS INJURED AND THEY GET A CALL AND HE HAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY WITH THREE FIELD GOALS TONIGHT. AL: DANCING AROUND THIS TIME, BRINGS IT BACK OUT TO THE 30 KIRK: IF SEATTLE CAN GET GENO SMITH MIKE WE TALKED ABOUT INTERNET RHYTHM WHERE HE CAN GET STREAKY, THEY MIXED UP A LOT OF FORMATIONS GROUPINGS. THEY HAVE BEEN IN A LOT WITH TWO TIGHT ENDS. WITH TWO ROOKIES PLAYING IN THIS SECONDARY, I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT GO A LITTLE BIT MORE SPREAD OUT TO GET THE GUYS IN SPACE AND BEAT THEM ONE-ON-ONE IN A GOOD MATCHUP. AL: FROM THE 29. FOUR OUT OF NINE. THE HIGH SNAP RINGS IT DOWN. WALKER TAKES IT TO THE 33 YARD SECOND AND SEVEN. KIRK: HE WAS SACKED LAST WEEK. GENO SMITH WAS SEVEN TIMES. I DON'T KNOW IF HE IS FEELING THAT RUSH OR LOOKING AT THE RUSH INSTEAD OF KEEPING HIS EYES DOWNFIELD. DOING A GOOD JOB OF KEEPING HIM OFF BALANCE SO FAR. AL: SEATTLE TRYING TO GET SOMETHING GOING, TWO MINUTES LEFT I>> AND THERE THEY ARE. OURTHE HALFTIME SHOW, COMING RIG UP. KIRK: A BIG NIGHT TONIGHT. AL: TELL ME ABOUT IT. WHAT ELSE IS NEW? HE HAS COME BACK ONTO THE SIDELINE FOR THE 49ERS. GOOD NEWS FOR THEM. FIND THE OPEN MAN. GETS INTO THE ACTION. FIRST TIME TONIGHT, TAKES IT ACROSS. KIRK: NICE JOB GETTING INTO THAT CREASE BY JACKSON SMITH. THAT IS THE GUY I THINK CAN REALLY HAVE A NIGHT IF THEY CAN LOCATE HIM. AL: SECOND TARGET OF THE NIGHT. THE SEAHAWKS HAVE ALL OF THEIR TIMEOUTS REMAINING. UNDER 1.5 MINUTES HERE. LOOK OUT FROM BEHIND. GETS IT AWAY ONLY FROM A MINIMAL LEONARD FLOYD, WHOSE FIRST YEAR AS A 49ER PUT THE PRESSURE ON. KIRK: SAN FRANCISCO HAS BEEN REALLY IMPRESSED WITH HIS APPROACH, COMING OVER FROM OBVIOUSLY A GREAT PASS RUSHER. HE LOVES DEFENDING THE RUN, JUST ALL IN. AL: I KNOW YOU GOT ALL THREE TIMEOUTS HERE BUT THEY HAVE TAKEN THEN. THEY ARE NOT MOVING WITH ALACRITY. THEY ARE UNDER 50 SECONDS. SECOND AND NINE. FOUR MAN RUSH. GETTING FREED, KNOCKED AWAY AT THE LAST MOMENT. METCALF IS THERE. GEORGE ODUM REACHES TO BUST IT THIRD DOWN AND NINE AFTER ALL OF THAT. KIRK: I THOUGHT METCALF -- MAYBE WORKS BACK TO THE BALL. HE DEFINITELY -- THAT IS A HECK OF AN EFFORT TO CATCH UP TO THE BALL BUT IF METCALF SLOWS HIS BODY DOWN, IT COMES BACK TO THE FOOTBALL, YOU HAD TO BE A NICE BETTER POSITION TO TRY TO FIGHT FOR THE FOOTBALL. INSTEAD, HE JUST KIND OF WAITED FOR THE BALL TO COME TO HIM INSTEAD OF GOING AND GETTING THE BALL THE WAY WE SAW DEEBO SAMUEL DOING EARLIER. AL: THIRD DOWN AND NINE AND FINALLY, A TIMEOUT IS TAKEN BY TIMEOUTS ON THE SHELF. THEY WON HERE. MEANWHILE, WE CAN TELL YOU FAMILIES AFFECTED BY HURRICANES MILTON AND HE'LL LEAN URGENTLY NEED SUPPORT TO HELP THE AMERICAN RED CROSS PROVIDE MEALS , SHELTER THESEAFTER ALL OF THE THE CAROLINAS. >> BACK TO BACK, TOO. THIRD DOWN AND NINE AT THE 49 THREE RECEIVERS SET TO THE LEFT. SMITH GOING AND IT GETS THE SIDELINE RIGHT THERE. CALLING IT IN. >> DJ METCALF OPENS UP A HUGE HOLD ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE DEFENSE. GREAT FOOTWORK BY SMITH BUT GOOD THROW THERE. THE TIMING TO THE OUTSIDE. WATCH DK METCALF CLEAR OUT THE ROOKIE, GREEN. HE RUNS WITH HIM AND OPENS IT UP NICE THROW OVER TOP FOR THE BIG AL: CONFIRMED BY A REPLAY IN THE LAST TWO MINUTES. 34 SECONDS. SMITH THROWS AND THAT IS CAUGHT. THAT IS GOING TO MAKE IT A SECOND AND ONE AND A TIMEOUT. KIRK: ALWAYS AMAZING. YOU SEE AN OFFENSE THAT IS STRUGGLING TO FIND THEMSELVES AND THEY HIT IT TO THE TWO-MINUTE HURRY UP AND IT JUST CLICKS, YOU KNOW? ONE PASS AWAY FROM GETTING GENO SMITH TO FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THE POCKET AND START ZONING IN AND MAKE ACCURATE THROWS AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE SEEN. DOWN TO THE 22-YARD LINE. AND WITH THESE RECEIVERS, YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A PLAY AND GET INTO THAT END ZONE. DEREK: BRING HIM TOWARD YOU WITH THE SCREEN TO THE RECEIVER. I THINK HE GOT IN THERE QUICKER THAN WHAT GENO SMITH WAS THINKING. HE WAS READY FOR IT. OUT OF TIME-OUTS. AL: STARTED BACK AT THEIR OWN 29-YARD LINE. EIGHTH PLAY OF THE DRIVE. SMITH ON THE MOVE. FLAG. COVERAGE ON NOAH FANT BY YADIM AND DRAWING THE FLAG. AND THE SEAHAWKS ARE GOING TO BE SET UP INSIDE THE 5. REFEREE: PASS INTERFERENCE. DEFENSE NUMBER 22. PENALTY OCCURRED AT THE 1-YARD SEATTLE BALL. KIRK: THAT'S A CORNER ON A TIGHT MATCHED UP MAN-TO-MAN. HE'S GRABBING ON TO THE OUT SIDE. HE'S GOT AHOLD OF THAT JERSEY. NOW, THEY'RE DOWN TO THE 2-YARD REMEMBER, NO TIME-OUTS. 16 SECONDS. QUICK DECISIONS. TIGHT WINDOWS HERE FOR GENO SMITH. WHO COULD WIN ONE-ON-ONE? WHERE'S THE MATCHUP? AL: LOCKET WAS THE INTENDED SEVERE. LOCKET YET TO CATCH A PASS CORY: THE SIGN WAS GOOD. YOU HAVE A MAN-TO-MAN COVERAGE. YOU HAD TWO RECEIVERS. JACKSON SMITH NJIGBA AND LOCKET TRYING TO RUN AN OUT AND A QUICK SLANT. THE TWO DEFENDERS RAN INTO EACH OTHER. BUT THE TIMING OFF THERE WITH GENO AND LOCKET. AL: SMITH, SECOND AND GOAL. LEAPING UP. BROKEN UP. LENOIR COVERING ON THE PLAY. SMITH-NJIGBA EIGHT SECONDS. KIRK: WHAT A GREAT MATCHUP. HE LOVES THIS BE CHALLENGED WITH JAXON SMITH-NJIGBA. THE BALL IS THROWN A LITTLE BIT LATE. THAT'S WHY IT FELT IT WAS BEHIND. YOU CAN SEE THE LEFT-HAND OF LENOIR KNOCKED THAT AWAY. HE'S TRIED LOCKETT AND JACKSON SMITH NJIGBA. -- J AXSNO SMITH-NJIGBA. AL: SMITH LOST IT AGAIN. NO GOOD, THOUGH. FOUR AND GOAL. THREE SECONDS. YOU'VE GOT BERNARDO GREEN THE ROOKIE. REFEREE: INCOMPLETE PASS. KIRK: THIS IS GOING TO BE CLOSE. SURE LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING TO BE ONE DOWN. AND THEN THE SECOND -- OH, JUST A TOE. JUST A TOE. AL: YEP. CROWD SEES IT. THEY THINK THERE'S SOME GREEN BETWEEN THE SHOE AND THE CHALK, BUT THERE ISN'T. AND NOW THEY'RE GOING TO SETTLE FOR A FIELD GOAL. AND THE CROWD DOESN'T LIKE THIS AT ALL. THERE IT IS AGAIN. CLEARLY THE TOE COMES DOWN ON THE LINE. NOW MYERS FOR A 20-YARD ATTEMPT. AND THE CROWD NOT HAPPY AT ALL WITH THAT. DOWN THE FIELD THEY GO. THAT ENDS THE HALF. AT LEAST THEY GET ON THE BOARD TO MAKE IT A 13-POINT DEFICIT. 16-3, SAN FRANCISCO. SMITH 109 YARDS IN THE FIRST HALF. PURDY THREW FOR 139. 49ERS ARE GOING TO GET THE SECOND HALF PICKOFF. WE GO TO KAYLE. KAYLEE. KAY LYE: WHAT CHANGED? >> WE HAVE TO STICK TO THE PLAN. WE HAD A COUPLE OF STALLED OUT THERE KEEP EXECUTING THE PLAN. MAKE A COUPLE OF ADJUSTMENTS AT HALFTIME. WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT. KAY LYE: YOU TOLD US PLAYING THE 49ERS WOULD BE A WAR OF ATTRITION. WHAT HAS THAT BEEN LIKE? >> THERE'S A LOT OF FOOTBALL TO BE PLAYED. LET'S GET BACK TO WORK. AL: BACK TO WORK THEY GO. COMING UP AFTER THE BREAK, "STATE FARM HALFTIME SHOW." TWO IN THE FIRST HALF AND DOWN 13, THEY'RE STILL IN THIS GAME. AL: A BIG-TIME POSSESSION FOR ED THAT BALL FOR 18:30 AS OPPOSED TO 11:34, OPPOSED TO 11:3 FOR SEATTLE. GOING TO RUN IT TO THE END ZONE AND OUT TO THE 22, 23-YARD AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE BEFORE THEY BLOW THE WHISTLE. AND A FLAG IS THROWN HERE. IT'S PATRICK TAYLOR ON THE RUNBACK. AND WE'LL HEAR FROM CRAIG ROLSTAD. REFEREE: ILLEGAL FORMATION. SEATTLE, NUMBER 23, A FIVE-YARD PENALTY, END OF THE PLAY. FIRST DOWN SAN FRANCISCO. AL: MOMENTS AGO KAYLEE WITH KYLE KAYLEE: KYLE, YOU CONTROLLED TIME OF POSSESSION, BUT YOU HAD TO SETTLE FOR THE THREE FIELD GOALS. HOW DO YOU DO FOR THE TOUCHDOWN? >> WE'VE GOT TO GET A BETTER DEAL ON THIRD DOWN. ALL THREE OF THEM WERE THIRD AND LONG. WE'VE GOT TO GET MORE MANAGEABLE MANAGEABLE. WE'RE THAT CLOSE ON THE SCREEN. THE LAST ONE WAS ONE GUY OFF. KAYLEE: WE SAW JORDAN MASON GO INTO THE X RAY ROOM? >> HE'LL HE'S GOOD TO GO. HE'LL START AWE US OFF HERE. AL: INDEED, HE IS. MASON HAS NOW CARRIED NINE TIMES FOR 73 YARDS. HE'S AVERAGING EIGHT YARDS PER TOTAL KIRK: BOY, IT'S FUN TO WATCH HIM RUN THAT OUTSIDE ZONE PLAY. IT'S A STAPLE WITH KYLE WE'VE SEEN IT RUN TONIGHT. WE'VE SEEN IT BOUNCE OUTSIDE WHERE THEY'RE ABLE TO SET THAT EDGE WITH THAT DOUBLE-TEAM. AND IT BOUNCES. WE'VE SEEN IT CUT BACK BEHIND THAT CENTER BLOCK. IT'S THE ONE THING THAT MIKE MCDONALD TOLD US THAT THE PACK SIDE HAS GOT TO BE REALLY BE READY TO GO THAT TIME THEY BOUNCED IT OFF WIDE. AL: GUERENDO COMES IN AND HE'LL PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN AFTER THE 42-YARD LINE. JULIAN LOVE COMES UP TO STOP 49ERS PICK UP THE INITIAL FIRST DOWN OF THE HALF. THERE IS WORK ON THAT SHOULDER. HE INJURED THAT ONE IN THE FIRST KIRK: YOU KNOW, HE'S SUCH A PHYSICAL GUY. IT'S HARD TO CHANGE HIS RUNNING STYLE. HE'S GOT TO USE THOSE BIG SHOULDERS TO RUN THROUGH THOSE LINEBACKERS. AL: THERE'S DEEBO SAMUEL. HE GOES IN MOTION. PURDY PROTECTED WELL. FIERS FIFIRES A LITTLE BIT SHORT. KIRK: BROWN HAD A COUPLE OF PENALTIES AGAINST THE GIANTS LAST WEEK. TOP ON AIYUK. REFEREE: THERE'S NO FOUL ON THE KIRK: TRE IS PRETTY ENGAGED WITH AL: AN ACQUITTAL. KIRK: HE MUST BE A GREAT -- GREAT MITT GATOR. HE MADE A -- MI TIGATOR BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE WAS STACKED AGAINST AL: HE'S FREE. SECOND DOWN AND 10 NOW. GUERENDO STAYS IN. PURDY DEEP DROP. OPEN. KITTLE DOWN THE SIDELINE. HE GOES BOUNCING OFF THE AND ANOTHER BIG PLAY WITH K'VON WALLACE MAKING THE STOP THERE. SO ON A SECOND AND 10, THEY GO 29 YARDS. AND INSIDE SEA HAWK TERRITORY, THE BALL AT THE 29-YARD LINE. KIRK: JUST A LITTLE HESITATION. CORNER FOR SAMUEL. NOBODY PICKS UP THE BIG FELLOW 85 WHO SNEAKS DOWN THAT LEFT PURDY LOOKS OFF TO SAFETY. NOBODY OUT IN THAT LEFT SIDE. BIG GAIN. AL: BACK TO THE GROUND. GUERENDO. GETS AWAY FROM THE FIRST MAN. A STOP THERE BY JULIAN LOVE. GUERENDO HAS CARRIED SIX TIMES FOR 15. KIRK: WE WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT HOW TO GO BACK TO THE MIKE SHANAHAN ERA AND THE ZONE PLAY IN DENVER AND OBVIOUSLY WITH KYLE SHANAHAN PEOPLE WERE ALMOST LIKE IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER WHO THE RUNNING BACK IS OR WHO THE QUARTERBACK IS. IT DOES. THOSE COACHES FIND GUYS WHO FIT THEIR SYSTEMS AND IT ALL FITS TOGETHER LIKE A PULLS. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE THEM CREDIT BOTH THE PLAYER AND THE COACH. AL: TIME AFTER TIME, SOMETHING IN THAT SHANAHAN FAMILY BLOOD. MEANWHILE, HERE GOES GUERENDO. SOME TOUGH RUNG. AND GUERENDO WILL PICK UP A FIRST DOWN ON THE 17-YARD LINE. KIRK: REMEMBER, HOW WE TALKED ABOUT THIS PLAY CAN GO FROM THE OUTSIDE OR COME BACK TO THE INSIDE? THEY'RE GOING TO CUT BACK ON THE NOSE GUARDS. HE'S LOOKING TO THE LEFT. LOOKING OUTSIDE. OUTSIDE, THAT HOLE IS OPENING RIGHT BACK THIS WAY. SO GOOD VISION THIS TIME. INSTEAD OF BALANCING IT. SEATTLE IS NOT LEGISLATE IT GET OUTSIDE. HE WAS PATIENT. AND THEN HE GETS OFF THE FIELD THERE AND READ THAT SEAM PERFECTLY. AL: A LOT OF EYE CANDY. AND TO THE 10-YARD LINE GOES PATRICK TAYLOR. ONE OF THE BACKUP BACKS OUT OF MEMPHIS. HE WAS A FREE AGENT. HAD NO TOUCHES THIS SEASON UNTIL NOW. MAINLY A SPECIAL TEAMS GUY. KIRK: HE TOLD US THEY'VE GOT LEARN HOW TO FINISH. UP 16-3. IT WOULD BE EASY TO SAY WE'VE GOT THIS GAME IN HAND. HE'S SAYING WE'RE GOING RIGHT DOWN THE FIELD AND WE'RE PUTTING SIX ON THE BOARD. AL: TRYING TO FINISH IT OFF. LIMITED TO ONE TOUCHDOWN AND THREE FIELD GOALS. AND THIS TIME, STUFFED AFTER A MINIMAL GAME IS TAYLOR. LEONARD WILLIAMS HAS TO GET BY. NUMBER 99. BIG THIRD UP AND 3 UPCOMING. KIRK: I WOULD GO BACK TO THAT ZONE PLAY. GREAT DEFENSE. LEONARD WILLIAMS SUCH A FORCE IN THAT FRONT. HERE WE GO, RED ZONE. THEY'RE GOING TO SETTLE FOR FIELD GOALS, THEY GOING TO SCORE TOUCHDOWNS? AL: THE 49ERS HAVE RUN THE BALL 24 TIMES TONIGHT. ONLY 16 PASS PLAYS. THIRD AND 3. KIRK: AND BUNCH SET UP TO THE MOTION IT OUT. AL: PURDY THROWS. AND RIGHT AT THE PYLON. TOUCHDOWN. KITTLE MAKES THE CATCH RIGHT AT THE PYLON. BIG SPINAL AND THIS TIME THE 49ERS -- BIG SPIKE. AND THIS TIME THE 49ERS PAY KIRK: THEY CAME BACK WITH JENNINGS TO CREATE THAT CONFUSION WITH THAT BUNCH WITH THREE RECEIVERS. WHAT A THROW. AND HOW ABOUT KITTLE? THE ATHLETIC ABILITY TO GET BOTH HIS FEET DOWN, JUST COMPLETELY PERFECT EXECUTION, THROW, CATCH AND THE FEET FOR THE TOUCHDOWN IN THAT RED ZONE AREA. THAT TIME THEY WERE ABLE TO SCORE THE TOUCHDOWN. AL: HERE'S WRIGHT. HE'S BEEN PERFECT FOR FIELD GOALS AND A COUPLE OF EXTRA POINTS. AND THE 49ERS IN A BIG GAME FOR BOTH TEAMS ON TOP 23-3. ABOUT A GUY WHO KNOWS WHERE THE SKYCAM IS, WHERE THE HANDHELD IS. KIRK: HE LIKES TO HAVE FUN AND DOMINATE AT THE SAME TIME. AL: MEANWHILE BREAKING TACKLES AND HE BREAKS FREE! EXACTLY WHAT THE SEAHAWKS NEEDED , AND FOR THE TOUCHDOWN, 97 YARDS! IF EVER THEY NEEDED A SPARK, THIS WAS THE MOMENT FOR THE DOWN BY 20, HE HAD FUMBLED AWAY A KICK EARLIER, HE TAKES IT FROM THE THREE ALL THE WAY. ONLY THE SECOND KICKOFF TOUCHDOWN IN THE LEAGUE THIS JASON MYERS WITH THE EXTRA POINT AND WHEN THINGS WERE VERY SOMBER AROUND HERE, ALL OF A SUDDEN BACK TO LIFE. KIRK: WHAT A PLAY. ANYTIME YOU HAVE A BIG RETURN, YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE FIRST GUY MISS. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE DOES BEING ABLE TO AVOID THIS MAN AVOID HIM, BOUNCE OFF OF ANOTHER GUY, THE BIG LINEBACKER GRAHAM, AND THEN IT IS A FOOT RACE. HE MAKES THE FIRST GUY MISS. THAT WAS MAHONEY. HE BOUNCES OFF. THEN HE LOOKS AROUND AND THERE' THEN HE LOOKS AROUND AND THERE'S NO ONE THERE. FINALLY WITH THE NEW RULES CHANGES, WE ARE EXCITED TO SEE THESE KICKOFF RETURNS. AL HAS BEEN FRUSTRATED EVERY SINGLE WEEK. AND THERE IS A RETURN FOR YOU. AL:AL: I WILL TELL YOU ANOTHER GUY, THE SPECIAL TEAMS COORDINATOR FOR THE SEATTLE SPEAKING OF THE HARBAUGH FAMILY. KIRK: HE IS FIRED UP. GOOD CALL, COACH. GETS THE HAWKS RIGHT BACK IN THE SHENAULT, BIG, PHYSICAL RECEIVER. POUNCING OFF OF THAT WOULD BE TACKLE. HE'S TIRED. [LAUGHTER] AL: WE JUST SAW J HARBAUGH, JIM'S SON. THE KID GETS A BREAK. HE WILL BE AS HAPPY AS ANYBODY IN THE BALLPARK. THAT GETS HIS TEAM RIGHT BACK IN THE GAME. THE 49ERS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO RUN THIS ONE BACK. DEEBO SAMUEL TAKES IT TO THE 31-YARD LINE TO BEGIN THE NEXT DRIVE. ONCE AGAIN, THE STANDINGS NOW IN THE NFC WEST, GOING INTO THE SEASON IT LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD BE THE TOUGHEST IN THE LEAGUE. WHO KNOWS AT THIS POINT. IF SEATTLE WERE TO WIN THE GAME, SAN FRANCISCO WOULD BE ALREADY TWO GAMES BACK AND 0-3 IN THE DIVISION. BIG GAME FOR SEATTLE BUT I THINK A BIGGER GAME FOR SAN FRANCISCO. KIRK: I THINK THAT'S WHY SAN FRANCISCO HAS COME OUT WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY ON A SHORT WEEK. AL: PATRICK TAYLOR IS THE BACK. THROW IT TO HIM. TAYLOR. 12 YARD GAIN. KIRK: TAYLOR, FOURTH-YEAR OUT OF EVERYTHING TAKEN DOWNFIELD AWAY. JUST BEING PATIENT. NO REASON TO GET THE BALL FORCED LINEBACKERS CLEARING OUT. NO PROBLEM. AND LOOK AT THIS, BANG. LOWER TO SHOULDER. HE'S ANOTHER BIG, 220 POUNDER. NOT BASHFUL THERE. AL: STILL TRYING TO CIRCULATE THAT SHOULDER TRYING TO GET BACK IN THE GAME. MADE THE ONE PLAY IN THE SECOND NONE SINCE. AGAIN. GUERENDO PICKS UP A COUPLE. SECOND DOWN AND EIGHT. KIRK:KIRK: GOOD HUSTLE FROM JARRAN REED. CATCHING SOME OXYGEN. THAT BACKSIDE HAS TO CHASE AND MAKE SURE HE DOES NOT HAVE THAT CUT BACK LANE. THE BIG FELLA, 300 POUNDER HUSTLING DOWN THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE TO MAKE THE TACKLE. AL: 8:30 LEFT IN THE THIRD. PURDY AVOIDS THE SACK, THROWS AND FINDS I UKE -- FREE. >> HOLDING, OFFENSE NUMBER 64. KIRK:KIRK: THEY ARE HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING PRESSURE ON THE LINEBACKER DOTSON, THE CENTER 64, GETS HIS ARMS WRAPPED AROUND AND PULLS HIM DOWN. GOOD CALL BY THE OFFICIAL. TAKES AWAY AGAIN BY THE 49ERS. AL: MAKES IT SECOND AND 18. KIRK:KIRK: THE FIRST TIME THIS CROWD HAS REALLY COME ALIVE SINCE EARLY IN THE GAME. AL: SECOND AND 18TH FROM THE 35. SETS, FIRES, AND IT IS UP AT THE 38 YARD LINE. JAJUAN JENNINGS WITH THE SEAHAWKS WILL TAKE THAT. ONLY A TWO YARD GAIN. KIRK: I THINK KYLE SHANAHAN LIKES THE MOBILITY. WE HAVE A MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE TREY BROWN IS LIMPING OFF. ALREADY SOME INJURIES IN THE SECONDARY. AT THE SAME TIME HE DOES NOT WANT TO BE ALWAYS RELYING UPON TRYING TO CREATE TOO MUCH. AL: NEHEMIAH CHRISTIAN IS A ROOKIE FROM AUBURN, FIFTH ROUND PICK. >> AT THE REPLAY ASSIST, THE LAST PASS WAS INCOMPLETE. THEREFORE THE BALL WILL BE ON THE 35 YARD LINE. AL: ALL RIGHT, NO BIG DEAL, IT MAKES IT THIRD AND 18 INSTEAD OF THIRD AND 16. KIRK: IT HELPS WITH THE CLOCK IF YOU ARE SEATTLE. SO YOU HAVE A ROOKIE LINED UP. HE WAS ON THE RIGHT. HE'S NOW MOVING FOR NOW OFF TO THE LEFT. BROCK PURDY'S LEFT. AL: SETS UP TO FACE JENNINGS. MEANWHILE, THERE IS SAMUEL STILL FINDING HIS WAY. TURNS IT INTO A BIGGER GAIN. FOURTH DOWN AND 4 KIRK: THE ROOKIE, HE DID NOT GET INVOLVED BUT HE HAD TO MAKE THAT DEEBO SAMUEL IS TOUGH TO BRING TRYING TO AFFECT FIELD POSITION IF NOTHING ELSE, PINNING GENO SMITH BACK. AL: SECOND PUNT. HIS FIRST WAS 44. THAT'SMES TO THE START, YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH NICK BOSA. HE IS AS QUICK AS ANYBODY ON THE DEFENSIVE LINE, AVERAGES THE FASTEST GET OFF AT .67. HE IS FIRED UP TONIGHT GOING UP AGAINST STONE, FORSYTH. SIX PRESSURES, THE MOST HE'S HAD IN A FIRST HALF ALL YEAR. LET'S SEE WHAT HE'S DONE AT THE TOP HERE ON THE EDGE. AL: JOEY BOSA, HIS BROTHER, NO SLOUCH EITHER. THAT IS AT THAT 19 YARD LINE BY AJ BARNER. KIRK:KIRK: AJ BARNER IS A GOOD-LOOKING PROSPECT, ROOKIE OUT OF MICHIGAN. 6'6", 250. AL: SMITH AT 10 OF 19 FOR 122. TACKLE BY ODOM. SECOND AND 8. KIRK: WE ARE AT THAT POINT IN THE GAME WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUE TO BE ONE-DIMENSIONAL JUST THROWING THE FOOTBALL. I DO THINK THEIR BEST OPPORTUNITY IS FINDING THE HOLES BETWEEN THE BACKERS AND DEFENSIVE BACKS AND SETTLING IN. LOCKET HAS HAD A QUIET NIGHT. ALWAYS CAPABLE OF MAKING BIG PLAYS. METCALF CURRENTLY NOT IN THE AL: PLAY-ACTION. THE PRESSURE IS PUT ON. THAT TIME IT WAS NICK BOSA, WHO ELSE? HE COMES STORMING IN. KIRK: IT IS JUST ABOUT AFFECTING THE QUARTERBACK. THERE IS THAT STANCE, ALMOST LOOK LIKE HE HAS LINED UP OFFSIDES. THAT WAS REALLY CLOSE. HE GOES RIGHT AROUND TO FORCE GENO SMITH TO STEP UP AND OUT. IMPACTING THE PLAY. AL: THIRD AND 8. THIRD DOWN BACK, CHARBONNET IS IN. THEY SPLIT HIM WIDE TO THE FIVE WIDE HERE. LOOKING THAT WAY, THROWING THAT WAY, IT IS THERE! YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT WHAT A QUIET NIGHT, BUT HE'S BEEN DOING THESE THINGS FOR 10 YEARS. TYLER LOCKETT. KIRK: THE TIGHT END TO THE LEFT, THE BACK TO THE RIGHT, THEY WANT TO CREATE SPACE AND CREATE VERTICAL OPPORTUNITIES AND THAT IS WHAT THEY HAVE RIGHT HERE. GOOD MATCHUP, SMART BY GENO SMITH TO THROW IT AND HE HITS A HUGE ONE FOR SEATTLE. AL: 39 GAIN OF ABOUT FIVE THAT TIME BY CHARBONNET. SECOND AND5. KIRK: THE OFFENSIVE LINE GIVE HIM JUST ENOUGH TIME. HE KNEW WHERE HE WANTED TO GO WHEN HE SPREAD HIM OUT. AL: MEANWHILE, LOCKETT JUST CAME OUT, HE GOES TO THE SIDELINE AFTER THAT. SECOND DOWN AND SIX. PLAY FAKE, FIRST DOWN. MORE TO THE 25 YARD LINE. KAYLEE: RIGHT NOW THAT 49ERS SECONDARY DOES NOT HAVE THE ROOKIE MALIK MUSTAPHA IN THE HE JUMPED OUT OF THE GAME WITH THAT INTERCEPTION ON GENO SMITH EARLY. BUT THE GAME IS OVER FOR HIM. HE INJURED HIS ANKLE LATE IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND HE HAS BEEN RULED OUT. AL: OH BOY. GEORGE ODUM WILL TAKE HIS PLACE, NUMBER 30 COMES IN. MINUS TRAVERSO WARD TO BEGIN WITH. SO THEY ARE REALLY DEPLETED BACK SMITH SETS UP THE SCREEN. TO THE FAKE, CAUGHT BY WALKER. GAIN OF ABOUT EIGHT INSIDE THE 20 YARD LINE. KIRK: THIS IS THE SEATTLE OFFENSE I THINK WE EXPECTED TO SEE, MUCH QUICKER BALL OUT OF THE HANDS OF GENO SMITH. AL: SECOND AND 2. WALKER CANNOT GET AROUND THE BROWN STOPPING HIM. LOSS OF ONE THIRD AND 3 FOR KIRK: THE NEW DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, THEIR FOURTH IN FIVE YEARS FOR KYLE SHANAHAN. AL:AL: AS GOOD AS THE DEFENSE HAS BEEN. A COUPLE HAVE GONE TO HEAD-COACHING POSITIONS LIKE ROBERT SALEH AND DEMECO RYANS. AND THAT PASSING WILL BE CAUGHT FOR A FIRST DOWN. DK METCALF COVERED BY GREENE, THE ROOKIE. KIRK: GREAT ROUTE AGAINST CHRIS WHAT HIM GIVE THE INSIDE MOVE TO THE SLANT, TO THE OUTSIDE. HE SAW THE MATCHUP AGAINST THE ROOKIE AND TOOK IT. AL: WALKER TO THE THREE YARD YOU CAN'T GET A FIRST DOWN WITHOUT A TOUCHDOWN. IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND 2. KIRK:KIRK: LEFT TACKLE THAT TIME. FROM THE OUTSIDE TO THE INSIDE. AL: MEANWHILE, LOCKETT HAS GONE BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM. WALKER TRIES TO BACK HIS WAY STOPS SHORT BUT THEY PICK UP A IN ALL LIKELIHOOD. FIRST AND GOAL. KIRK: THIS KID IS POWERFUL, LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY. HE WILL DRIVE AND PUSH. IF YOU THINK YOU CAN BRING HIM DOWN WITH ONE GUY, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO. AL: SMITH. CAN HE GET IN? TRIES TO BURROW HIS WAY IN. KIRK: I THINK FRED WARNER WENT OVER THE TOP TO KEEP HIM OUT. PERFECTLY TIMED UP BY 54. AL: HERE IS BOTH SO. -- BOTH SAW. SECOND DOWN AND GOAL WITH 1:50, THE DRIVE 93 YARDS. KIRK: SOME CONFUSION. AL: RUNNING AROUND. KIRK: GOT 12 GUYS OUT THERE. AL: THE OFFICIALS HAD TO LET THEM MAKE THE SUBSTITUTION. THE CROWD DOESN'T LIKE IT. ENABLES THEM TO GET THE RIGHT PERSONNEL IN. STILL RUNNING AROUND. STILL MOTIONING. MEANWHILE WALKER GOES TO THE END ZONE FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. KENNETH WALKER INTO THE END ZONE. AND THE SEAHAWKS WHO WERE DOWN BY 20 CAN MAKE IT SIX WITH THE EXTRA POINT. KIRK: GO BACK TO THE KICK RETURN. THIS STADIUM WAS FLAT. THE GAME FELT LIKE THE NINERS DID WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO. THEY GO DOWN AND SCORE A TOUCHDOWN, UP CONVINCINGLY AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE GAME WILL BE OVER. BUT NOW THEY HAVE WALKED IT ALL THE WAY BACK AFTER THAT RETURN. AL: THE KICK IS GOOD OFF THE FOOT OF JASON MYERS. WE TOLD YOU BE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT MOON. KIRK: I THINK THAT'S OUR FIRST OFFICIAL CODE ON A GRAPHIC TO PROMOTE A GAME. QUITE A STORY NEXT WEEK. AL: A RESOUNDING ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM THE CROWD AS DEEBO SAMUEL TAKES IT FROM INSIDE THE FIVE. TIME FOR TONIGHT'S JOURNEY, PRESENTED BY HON DAY -- HYUNDAI. DEEBO SAMUEL, WE SAW HIM WITH THAT KICKBACK. KITTLE HAS A TD. GREAT RIGHT THERE. HAWKS, TOUCHDOWNS ON THE LAST TWO POSSESSIONS. KIRK: GET READY FOR THE DB TO CRANK UP HERE. THE CROWD IS EXCITED AFTER 14 UNANSWERED. AL: 26 YARD LINE, FAKE TO ROLLING, THROWING, NO GOOD. KAYLEE: KYLE SHANAHAN TOLD ME HE WAS GOING TO PUT JORDAN MASON BACK TO WORK AFTER THAT LEFT SHOULDER INJURY, BUT THIS MAKES A SECOND DRIVE WHERE HE'S NOT ON THE FIELD. HE'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME WITH A NEW HEAVY, SUPPORTIVE TAPE JOB ON HIS SHOULDER AND DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN TO KEEP IT LOOSE ON THE SIDELINE, BUT NOT ON THE FIELD. AL: THERE'S KAYLEE RIGHT ON THE ACTION, BIRDSEYE VIEW OF THAT. HE WAS IN FOR ONE PLAY. STARTED THE SECOND HALF, EIGHT YARDS, CAME RIGHT OUT. KIRK: ARTIE BURNS JUST DROPPED OFF THE FIELD INJURED. SO THE ROOKIE OFF TO THE LEFT IS PRITCHETT. AL: CHRIS CONLEY IN MOTION. PURDY THOUGHT ABOUT RUNNING. THE THROW, MAKES THE CATCH. HE WAS SLOWED BY BAKER AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. IT WILL BE THIRD AND 10. KIRK: AMAZING WHAT MOMENTUM CAN DO FOR THE DEFENSE. THE DEFENSE HAS BEEN STRUGGLING AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND STRUGGLING AGAINST THE SCHEME. ALL OF A SUDDEN A LITTLE MORE JUICE, A LITTLE MORE EFFORT. THE CHANCE TO GET OFF THE FIELD AL: THIRD AND 10. PURDY HIT AS HE THROWS. CAUGHT AT THE 30 BUT SHY OF THE LOVE MAKES THE TACKLE ONTO ON JENNINGS. FOURTH DOWN AND THE NINERS ARE GOING TO PUNT AGAIN. KIRK: MY GOSH, THIS IS A HUGE PLAY AND YOU'RE OUT IN SPACE. YOU HAVE TO COME UP, NOBODY ELSE OUT THERE. IT'S ONE-ON-ONE. CAN YOU FIELD? AL: THE END OF THREE, OR ARE WE DO FOR A FABULOUSRE GOING TO PUN SEATTLE HAS A CHANCE. TO TAKE THE LEAD WITH A TOUCHDOWN HERE. WE WILL SEE HOW THE DRIVE COMMENCES. FAIR CATCH ALL KINDS OF CALL TO -- CONTACT. WILLIAMS PULLED UP WITH A CATCH. WHO DID WHAT? CHRIS CONLEY RAN INTO HIM. KIRK: WITHERSPOON LOOKS LIKE HE MAY HAVE PUSHED HIM INTO THE RETURNER. AL: THAT'S THE DISCRETION RIGHT SO IF THEY PICK IT UP -- KIRK: CONLEY SAYING, HE PUSHED ME, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. >> THE SAN FRANCISCO PLAYER WHO HIT THE SEAHAWK RECEIVER WAS BLOCKED INTO HIM, THEREFORE THERE IS NO FOUL. IT WILL BE FIRST DOWN AND 10, AL: IT'S HARD TO GET THE DEMONS OUT OF YOUR HEAD, THE 49ERS HAVE BLOWN TWO DOUBLE-DIGIT LEADS THIS SEASON. TO THE RAMS IN ARIZONA AND HERE THEY ARE AGAIN ON THE VERGE. KIRK: THAT'S WHAT WE HEARD ABOUT ALL WEEK, WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THOSE MISTAKES. YOU HAVE TO FINISH, THINGS OF THAT NATURE. UP 20 AFTER THAT KICKOFF RETURN, IT HAS BEEN A DIFFERENT ENERGY. GENO SMITH, HE IS A STREAKY QUARTERBACK. 5-6 FOR 78 YARDS ON THE LAST HE GOT INTO THEHE FIELD STANDS A CALLED. IT WILL BE SEATTLE BALL, FIRST AND 10. AL: THIS IS AS CLOSE AS A GETS. WHAT DID YOU SEE? >> WE SAW A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT ANGLES WHERE IT IS CLEAR IT HITS THE FINGER OF THE RECEIVING TEAM PLAYER. THEN THERE IS A CLEAR RECOVERY FROM SAN FRANCISCO. I THINK THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN REVERSED. AL: IT IS NOT. KIRK: SO MUCH GOING ON THERE. YOU HAVE A GUIDE LOCKED INTO THE RETURNER BUT IT IS UP TO THE RETURNER TO PROTECT HIMSELF. IT IS A LIVE BALL. THERE IS A QUICK RECOVERY. THERE IT IS. SEATTLE CATCHES A BREAK. AL: MAJOR. SECOND AND 6. INSIDE THE 20. DRAW PLAY, CHARDONNAY -- CHARBONNET MOVES TO THE OUTSIDE. PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN. KIRK: THIS KID, MOST OF THE CARRIES GO TO WALKER. HE HAD A QUIET WEEK LAST WEEK AGAINST THE GIANTS. THEY HAVE LEANED ON BOTH OF THESE RUNNING BACKS. WHAT A VERY DIFFERENT RUNNING NOT AS QUICK AS WALKER BUT YOU CAN SEE THE STRENGTH HE HAS TO BREAK THROUGH SOME TACKLES. AL: AT THE 30. SMITH, EVERYBODY COVERED. FLAG IS THROWN. NICK BOSA FORCED THE ISSUE. KIRK: THIS IS GREAT BECAUSE NOT ONLY. AL: FORCED THE ISSUE WITH THE KIRK: IT IS GREAT. THIS GUY IS LIKE A LINEBACKER AS FAR AS HIS INTELLIGENCE PLAYING DEFENSIVE END. I FEEL LIKE WHAT MOST PEOPLE RECOGNIZE WITH HIM IS HOW QUICK HE IS. REFEREE: INELIGIBLE MAN DOWNFIELD, OFFENSE, NUMBER 67. THAT PENALTY IS DECLINED. KIRK: THE GUY WHO SAW IT WAS A SCREEN FIRST IS 97. HE DOES NOT EVEN RUSH THEY ARE THINKING HE IS GOING TO COME TO ME. BOSA IS GOING TO COME TO ME. INSTEAD HE GETS THE PENALTY. AL: PERFECT ON HIS PART. SECOND AND 10. THERE WILL BE THIRD AND 10. CHARBONNET GAINS NARY A YARD. NO-HUDDLE HERE. KIRK: THE WAY BOSA IS PLAYING RIGHT NOW, YOU BETTER HAVE CHARBONNET OVER HERE TO THE RIGHT HELPING OUT. AL: BOSA GETS THERE BUT SMITH ESCAPES AND THEN JUST THROWS IT KIRK: I WAS SURPRISED THAT CHARBONNET LEAKED OUT OF THE BACKFIELD AND KEPT FORESIGHT ON AN ISLAND -- FORSYTHE ON AN ISLAND. HE IS DOING A GOOD JOB, TRYING HARD. THE BALL ALMOST CAME OUT. HE GOT HIS HANDS ON THE BALL. THE THIRD RIGHT TACKLE FOR THIS OFFENSE. BOSA MAKING ALL THREE PLAYS ON THAT SERIES. AL: FOURTH PUNT OF THE NIGHT. ANOTHER BEAUTY. GETTING TACKLED AT THE 11 WAS COWIN FATE AWAITS. KIRK: THERE YOU GO. ARE YOU A SCARY MOVIE GUY? AL: NO, SIR. KIRK: ME EITHER. AL: COMEDIES. ROMANTIC COMEDIES. WE LIKE DRAMATIC AGAINST. WE HAD ONE LAST WEEK AND WE HAVE ONE TONIGHT. DEEBO SAMUEL IS A RUNNING BACK IN THIS SET. CONFUSION. THERE IS YOUR FLAG. NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. NOT VERY OFTEN DO YOU SEE TWO GUYS IN MOTION ALMOST RUNNING INTO EACH OTHER. REFEREE: ILLEGAL SHIFT, OFFENSE, NUMBER 82 AND 85 BOTH MOVING. REPLAY FIRST DOWN. KIRK: BOTH TIGHT ENDS MOVING AT THE SAME TIME. I WILL GUESS THAT KITTLE IS PROBABLY RIGHT. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. AL: FIRST AND 15. KIRK: TECHNICALLY IF YOU GO BACK TO WHERE THE FUMBLE HAPPENED ON THE POINT RETURN -- PUNT RETURN, IT COSTS THEM 70 YARDS OF FIELD DECISION. AL: HE THROWS OUT OF THE END UP TO THE 20 YARD LINE. KIRK: A COUPLE OF THINGS THERE. LOOK WHERE HE IS BACKED UP. HE IS STANDING ON HIS OWN GOAL I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO ABORT AND THROW IT AWAY. AT THE LAST SECOND HE FINDS JUSZCZYK ON THE CHECK DOWN. MASON STILL TRYING TO WORK THE SHOULDER LOSE ON THE SIDELINE. UP THE MIDDLE GOES TAYLOR TO THE 23 YARD LINE. TAYLOR SEEMS TO BE DOING THE BULK OF THE BALL CARRYING. KIRK: HE IS THERE FIFTH BACK. WE HAVE A MAN DOWN. IT IS THE LEFT GUARD. AL: UNSUNG GUY. HE IS HAVING A HECK OF A YEAR. KIRK: THE INJURIES ARE ALL OVER THE LEAGUE AT THIS TIME OF YEAR. THESE TEAMS, BANKS HAS TO COME O HE HAS BEEN BATTLING A CALF INJURY THIS YEAR. HE WILL GO TO THE BENCH. THE BALL IS AT THE 23 YARD LINE. 11:17 LEFT IN THE FOURTH. DEEBO SAMUEL IS THE BACK. TOSS TO HIM. THEY WILL BLOW THAT PLAY DEAD BEFORE THE SNAP. KIRK: MOVEMENT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE OFFENSIVE LINE. SEATTLE WAS DIALING IT UP. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN BLITZING A TON. THAT TIME EIGHT OR NINE GUYS WERE UPTIGHT. AL: A BATTLE OF ATTRITION. IT CERTAINLY IS EVERY TIME THESE TEAMS MEET. SEEMS LIKE THAT EVERY GAME IN THE NFL. KIRK: YEP. AL: SAMUEL WILL WORK HIS WAY OVER TO THE SIDELINE. HE IS OUT. REFEREE: THERE ARE TWO FILES ON FALSE START, OFFENSE, NUMBER 66. PERSONAL FOUL, FACEMASK, SEATTLE KIRK: HOW ABOUT GETTING A FACEMASK ON WHAT IS REALLY A DEAD PLAY? IT WAS ON SAMUEL AS HE WAS RUNNING THE FOOTBALL. THERE HE IS GRABBING A HOLD OF THE FACEMASK. THAT WAS GOING TO BE A FIVE YARD PENALTY THAT WAS GOING TO COST THE NINERS GOING BACKWARD. NOW 15 YARDS ON TOP OF THAT. AL: ANOTHER PLAYER GOT HURT SOMEWHERE IN THERE. BANKS IS OUT. KITTLE FOR THE MOMENT IS ON THE THERE IS SAMUEL LOOKING NONE THE WORSE AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT. KIRK: THAT IT'S WHERE YOU RISK PUTTING HIM IN THERE AS A BALLCARRIER. HE IS ONE OF YOUR BETTER RECEIVERS. BECAUSE OF THE INJURIES AND BECAUSE HE IS SO DARN GOOD, YOU WANT TO THE BALL IN HIS HANDS. THAT HAPPENED RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING OF THAT PLAY. IT LOOKED LIKE HE RAN INTO JONES. HIT HIM RIGHT ON THE HAND. INSTEAD OF FIRST AND 15, YOU GET POSITIVE YARDS. AL: HE LOOKS LIKE HE IS READY TO COME BACK IN. HE HAS TO STAY OUT FOR AT LEAST A PLAY. YOU HAVE TAYLOR AND THERE IS THE RUNNING BACK. FIRES, CAUGHT, THAT IS AIYUK TO THE 41 YARD LINE. BRANDON AIYUK WITH ONLY HIS SECOND CATCH OF THE NIGHT. SAMUEL TROTS BACK IN. KIRK: ANYTIME YOU SPLIT YOUR SAFETIES LIKE THIS, THERE IS THE OPENING FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO THAT BALL IS ANTICIPATED, IT IS OUT EARLY. HE THROWS AIYUK RIGHT INTO THAT WHOLE -- HOLE. GREAT CATCH, GREAT THROW. AL: SAMUEL GETS RIGHT BACK INTO THE ACTION. TO THE 40. >> THE SECOND HALF HAS BEEN A STRUGGLE FOR AARON BANKS. HE GOT A IV BECAUSE HE STARTED CRAMPING. NOW I AM TOLD THOSE CRAMPS ARE ACTING UP AGAIN. AS THE TRAINER WORKS ON HIS LEFT HAMSTRING. THE GOOD NEWS FOR THE NINERS AS THEY HAVE A SMALL BYE WEEK AFTER THIS GAME. BUT IN THEIR NEXT GAME IS AGAINST KANSAS CITY. PURDY, INCOMPLETE. THAT WOULD NOT HAVE GONE ANYWHERE ANYWAY. KIRK: THIS IS WHAT MIKE MCDANIEL WANTED ALL NIGHT. THEY HAVE TO GET HIM INTO OBVIOUS PASSING SITUATIONS. IF KYLE SHANAHAN IS DICTATING THINGS, IT WILL BE A LONG NIGHT. HERE IS ONE OF THE MORE CRITICAL MOMENTS. A CHANCE TO GET HIM OFF HIS SPOT. AL: HE WAS FRANTIC, HE WANTED TO GET DTOS GET DTOTSON BACK IN THE GAME. KITTLE IS BACK IN THE GAME. AND NOW YOU HAVE A TIMEOUT TAKEN BY SAN FRANCISCO. REMEMBER, THEY LOST THAT CHALLENGE. SO THEY ONLY HAVE ONE REMAINING. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS GAME FOR SEATTLE TO WIN IT AND TAKE A TWO GAME LEAD. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THEY STARTED OUT WITH THE SAME THING. KIRK: IF I ASK YOU WHO THE BEST TEAM IN THE NFC IS, NOT RIGHT NOW BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ROSTER AND YOU LOOK AT THEIR POTENTIAL, I STILL THINK SAN FRANCISCO, ESPECIALLY IF THEY GET CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY BACK. THERE ARE SOME GOOD TEAMS OUT IF THEY ARE HEALTHY, THEY ARE STILL A FORCE. AL: AGREED. THIRD AND 9. PURDY FIRES, HIGH, INCOMPLETE. GOOD COVERAGE. THAT WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE. FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: THEY DROPPED BACK AND PLAYED ZONE. GOOD JOB OF COMMUNICATING. HE FELT PRETTY GOOD ABOUT GETTING THEM OFF THE FIELD. AL: HE WILL TRY TO DEADEN IT BEFORE IT GOES INTO THE END IT BOUNCES OUT THE 1 GO BACK TO CONTROVERSIAL PLAY ON THE PUNT. >> I SPOKE WITH WALT ANDERSON AND THE COMMAND CENTER IN NEW YORK. THEY DID NOT GET OUR ENHANCED VIDEO THAT SHOWED THE BALL TOUCHING THE FINGER. WHAT THEY HAD WAS THE RAW FEED FROM OUR CAMERAS AND IT WAS NOT CLEAR AND OBVIOUS TO THEM THAT IT TOUCHED THE FINGER. AL: OBVIOUSLY A GIGANTIC PLAY IN SEATTLE IS NOW BACKED UP TO THEIR OWN 3 YARD LINE. THE PASS GOES TO WALKER. THE IS TAKEN DOWN BY ODOM. KIRK: THERE IS GEORGE KITTLE BACK OUT ON THE FIELD FOR SAN WHEN SEATTLE HAS PLAYED AT THEIR BEST, IT HAS BEEN QUICK, DECISIVE SHOWS -- THROWS. AL: SECOND AND 4. PASS IS CAUGHT, LOCKET, -- LOCKETT. KIRK: YOU HAVE SOME INEXPERIENCE. A ROOKIE CORNER ON THE LEFT. ODOM IS A BACKUP SAFETY. THE EXTRA MAN COMES. THE PAST TAKEN IN. I ENOUGH FOR A FIRST DOWN BY DK KIRK: THEIR USE -- THERAPY KIRK: THEIR USE -- THERAE HE IS SHOWING HIS PHYSICALITY. HE MAKES A GREAT CATCH. AL: IS THIRD OF THE NIGHT. 49 YARDS TOTAL. METCALF AGAIN THIS TIME ON THE KIRK: HOLDING CALL. AL: THEY FLAG HERE. 28 YARD LINE. REFEREE: HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER 88. 10 YARD PENALTY FROM THE SPOT OF THE FOUL. KIRK: HE WAS OUT IN FRONT TRYING TO MAKE A BLOCK. WE TALKED ABOUT THE ROOKIE TRYING TO GET THE LEVERAGE. THAT IS ROOKIE ON ROOKIE. HE GRABS THE JERSEY BECAUSE OF THE EFFORT AND THE TECHNIQUE. THEY HAD A LITTLE BIT OF MOMENTUM. THEY GO BACKWARDS AFTER THAT. AL: FIRST AND 18. RUSH FOUR. DANCING IN THE POCKET. INTERCEPTED! PICKED OFF BY GREEN. THE ROOKIE INVOLVED IN THE LAST PLAY IS INVOLVED IN THE NEXT THE ROOKIE OUT OF FLORIDA STATE WITH A HUGE PICK. KIRK: GENO SMITH HAS ALL THE TIME THAT HE NEEDS. FORSYTHE HOLDS UP ON THE OUTSIDE AGAINST BOSA. WHAT A JOB BY THIS ROOKIE OF STEPPING IN FRONT. HE IS OUT THERE ON AN ISLAND AGAINST ONE OF THE BEST IN THE NFL. HE SHOWS SOME MOXIE HERE FOR A YOUNG GUY. HE STEPS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THAT GENO SMITH WENT TO LEFT, RIGHT, CAME BACK, HE COULD SQUEEZE ONE INTO THE BIG RECEIVER, DK THAT IS A BALL HE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE BACK. AL: TWO INTERCEPTIONS TONIGHT BY GREEN THE FIRST OF HIS CAREER. KITTLE BACK INTO THE GAME. THREE TURNOVERS FOR THE HAW KS, NONE FOR THE NINERS. TO THE OUTSIDE, TURNS IT BACK, GETS INSIDE THE 10 YARD LINE. KIRK: BROWN STARTED TO LOSE GROUND. I THINK GENO SMITH EXPECTED HIM TO COME ACROSS THE FIELD. INSTEAD HE LOST GROUND AND GOT DEPTH, MAKING IT EASIER FOR GREEN TO STEP IN FRONT OF THAT IS WHAT I THINK GENO SMITH WAS FRUSTRATED ABOUT. A MISCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE RECEIVER AND THE QUARTERBACK. GAIN OF MAYBE A YARD OR SO. THIRD DOWN AND 3. KIRK: AT THIS POINT, OBVIOUSLY, THEY ARE NOT IN ANY HURRY. THEY WOULD LOVE A TOUCHDOWN BUT A FIELD WOULD DO THE JOB AS WELL TO GET THEM UP BY A COUPLE OF POSSESSIONS. GENO HAS TO PUT THAT ON STILL 6:42 AL: YOU WILL HAVE TO FIND A NEW DEVICE TO LOOK AT THE VIDEO. NOT SINCE BILL BELICHICK HAVE WE SEEN A SLAM DOWN SINCE THAT. THIRD AND 4. PURDY, SHOULDERS SHAKE, THROWS INTO TRAFFIC. TITTLE, -- KITTLE, TOUCHDOWN, HIS SECOND. KITTLE WENT BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM, COMES BACK, NOW HE IS GOING TO CELEBRATE. KIRK: THAT IS BOTH OF THEIR WIVES. THEY KNEW EXACTLY IF THEY SCORE, THEY ARE COMING UP INTO THE STANDS TONIGHT. AL: DOUBLE DATING. KIRK: THEY GET THE FULLBACK IN THE RUNNING BACK TO CLEAR OUT. THEY TAKE TWO DEFENDERS WITH THEM. NOW IT IS JUST ONE-ON-ONE IN THE MIDDLE. THAT IS A MATCHUP YOU ARE GOING TO WIN EVERY TIME WITH KITTLE. THE TIMING WITH PURDY. HE MAKES A GOOD THROW ON-TIME. AL: GOING FOR TWO TO TRY TO MAKE IT A 14 POINT ADVANTAGE. PURDY THROWS, FLAG IS THROWN. BOTH OF KITTLE'S TOUCHDOWNS TONIGHT HAVE COME ON THIRD DOWN REFEREE: OFFSIDES, DEFENSE, NUMBER 28, LINED UP IN THE NEUTRAL ZONE. THE BALL WILL BE PLACED AT THE 1 AL: THAT IS ON A ROOKIE. KITTLE NOW WITH TWO TOUCHDOWNS TONIGHT AND FIVE FOR THE SEASON. KIRK: THE ROOKIE, GREEN, WHAT A TIME TO HAVE THAT INTERCEPTION. AL: FROM THE 1. FOR TWO. STUFFED. NO. 6:20 LEFT IN THE FOURTH IN SEATTLE WHERE THE 49ERS ARE UP BY A DOZEN. CHECK WITH A CELEBRATION TANDEN. THERE THEY ARE, LOOKING FOR THEIR WIVES. WHAT TO WE CALL THAT? KIRK: I LOVE THE PUNCH. AL: AND THEN THEY GO AND WATCH IT. KIRK: KITTLE FOR GOD, HE HAD TO BE REMINDED. AL: SAN FRANCISCO BY 12. WILLIAMS TRIPPED UP AT THE 30 KIRK: HERE ARE THE NEXT GENERATION STATS. HE HAS BEEN A FORCE IN THE RUN GAME TONIGHT. HE KNEW HE WOULD HAVE TO STEP AL: NO DOUBT. THE SEAHAWKS TAKE A BALL AT THE 30 YARD LINE. DOWN BY A COUPLE OF POSSESSIONS. NEXT TO NOTHING. KIRK: SEATTLE -3 IN TURNOVERS THAT HAS BEEN THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS FOOTBALL GAME. AL: SECOND AND 9. SMITH FIRES, CAUGHT, AND OUT FOR A FIRST DOWN. KIRK: WITH SAN FRANCISCO SITTING BACK, GENO SMITH HAS TO NOT ONLY COMPLETE PASSES, HE HAS TO HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY WITH THIS MUCH TIME LEFT IN THE FOOTBALL GAME AT A TWO POSSESSION GAME. AL: SMITH UNDER PRESSURE. HE GETS AWAY. SMITH AND JAKE BUT MAKING THE THAT WILL TAKE US DOWN TO THE FIVE MINUTE MARK L REGULATION. KIRK: AMAZING WHAT THIS SECONDARY AS THE. TAKEN DOWN BECAUSE OF T INJURIES. A LOT OF THESE GUYS HA PLAYED A LOT OF FOOTBALL. AL: FIVE WIDE HERE. THAT WAS BOSA AGAIN. KIRK: HE LINES UP ON THE BACKSIDE. GOOD AGAINST GOOD. BOSA MATCHED UP THERE AGAIN. AL: THIRD DOWN AND 5. A FLAG. NO INDEED, METCALF WILL TAKE IT TO THE END ZONE. WHAT ABOUT THE FLAG BACK AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE? ILLEGAL SHIFT WILL BE THE CALL AGAINST SEATTLE. NEGATED WHAT YOU JUST SAW. REFEREE: ILLEGAL SHIFT, SEATTLE. KIRK: HE WENT OUT IN MOTION. HE NEVER STOPS. HERE IS WALKER RIGHT HERE. WHEN HE GOES OUT TO THE LEFT, HE KEEPS MOVING. HE NEEDS TO COME SET AT HE NEVER THE RELEVANT PENALTY COSTS THE SEAHAWKS A HUGE TOUCHDOWN. AL: THIRD AND 10 AFTER THE FLAG. FIGHTING FOR IT. BOBO GETS IT. KIRK: JAKE BOBO FIGHTING FOR THAT FIRST DOWN. HE HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN SPECIAL TEAMS. AL: SMITH OUTSIDE. HE GOES RIGHT BACK TO BOBO. A GAIN OF SEVEN. KIRK: METCALF CHECKS BACK INTO THAT TOUCHDOWN WAS PERFECTLY THROWN. BOSA TRYING TO COME IN. SEATTLE WILL RECOVER THE BALL. BRADFORD IS THERE. KIRK: YOU KNOW WHO KNOCKED THE BALL LOOSE WAS FRED WARNER. HE HAS LEGENDARY STATUS HE LIKES TO COME FROM THE TOP DOWN AND PUNCH THAT ONE OUT. AL: THIRD AND 2. WHISTLE BEFORE THE SNAP. REFEREE: FALSE START, OFFENSE, FIVE YARD PENALTY, STILL THIRD AL: WATER HAS HAD FOUR FORCED FUMBLES THE SEASON. KIRK: AS GOOD AS HE IS IN EVERY OTHER ASPECT, THIS IS PROBABLY THE THING THAT ANNOUNCERS TALK ABOUT THE MOST BECAUSE HE DOES IT ON SUCH A REGULAR BASIS. HE HAS A KNACK FOR IT. HE SAID SOMETIMES YOU JUST FEEL THAT ONE WAS PERFECT. AL: WALKER FIGHTS FOR THE FIRST SEATTLE HAS ALL OF ITS TIMEOUTS AND THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING. KIRK: TRYING TO GET THIS SCORE IN BEFORE NEEDING TO USE THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING OR A TIMEOUT. AL: GENO SMITH ON THE MOVE. KIRK: HE MISSED ONE. HE HAD WALKER DOWN THE RIGHT NO ONE TOOK HIM DOWN THE RIGHT HE WAS RIGHT IN THE DIRECTION. HE WAS OUT OF THE POCKET. JUST DID NOT SEE HIM. AL: THAT IS TAUGHT. WALKER. TACKLE AFTER A VERY SHORT AGAIN. SMITH CAUGHT UNDERNEATH. THE CLOCK KEEPS ROLLING. KIRK: EVERYBODY IS TIRED OUT ON THAT FIELD. SMITH TRIED TO GET ONE MORE PLAYOFFS. AL: FIRST AND GOAL. WELL PROTECTED. LOCKETT REACHING FOR IT. STRETCHING. THERE IS YOUR TWO-MINUTE WARNING. THEY HAVE THREE TIMEOUTS. DOWN BY 12. KIRK: GIVE THIS OFFENSIVE LINE A LOT OF CREDIT. THE GOT INSIDE THE SAFETY. THAT WOULD'VE BEEN A SPECTACULAR HE TRIES TO USE HIS BODY CON TO GET THAT BALL DOWN. AL: COMING UP AFTER THE GAME, THE POST GAME SHOW, EXCLUSIVELY ON PRIME. PLENTY TO TALK ABOUT. KIRK: WALKER SLIPS DOWN THE THOSE WERE A COUPLE OF TOUCHDOWN OPPORTUNITIES. THAT SAVES THE CLOCK AND GIVES YOU A CHANCE. AL: THE BACK IS CHARBONNET. THAT IS OUT OF THE END ZONE. YOU KNOW WHAT IS INTERESTING IN THIS GAME WITH ALL OF THE PRESSURE ON THE QUARTERBACK? NO SACKS. NONE. I JUST LOOKED AT THAT. IT DOES NOT FEEL LIKE THAT. KIRK: GOOD FEELS LIKE THERE AL: THIRD AND GOAL. ESPECIALLY RIGHT THERE. AGAIN, THE PRESSURE WAS ON. FORCING SMITH TO THROW OFF OF HIS BACK FOOT. THE OFFENSIVE LINE DID NOT MOVE. I THOUGHT MAYBE THERE WOULD BE A POTENTIAL FLAG. WATCH THE LEFT SIDE OF THE LINE. THE BALL IS SNAPPED. NO ONE MOVES. AL: IT LOOKS LIKE ONLY WILLIAMS. FOURTH AND GOAL. ALMOST A LASTGASP HERE FOR THE CAN THEY GET IT IN? SMITH UNDER PRESSURE. LOCKETT, TOUCHDOWN. SOME FUTURE PLAYS TONIGHT. KIRK: THEY PUT HIM IN A BUNCH FORMATION. HE WILL ATTACK AND THEN COME BACK TO THE FOOTBALL. GOOD JOB OF THE TOP OF THE ROUTE. EXACTLY WHERE HE WAS. HE HAD TO COME BACK TO THE BOSA, NO SACKS, HE HAS BEEN SO GENO FELT HIM AND GOT THE BALL OUT ON TIME. AL: THAT MAKES IT A FIVE-POINT 20-24. KIRK: MOST IMPORTANTLY, ALL THREE TIMEOUTS. AL: NOW YOU ARE SEATTLE, IT USED TO BE, THE ONSIDE KICK, YOU HAVE TO DECLARE IT NOW IF YOU'RE GOING FOR IT. THE OTHER OPTION IS TO KICKOFF AND TAKE THE TIMEOUTS. KIRK: I THINK WITH ALL THREE TIMEOUTS OVER I WOULD CONSIDER JUST KICKING IT DEEP. GET THE BALL BACK TO GENO SMITH MAYBE WITH ABOUT A MINUTE LEFT TO GO. YOU HAVE A VETERAN QUARTERBACK IN A REALLY GOOD GROUP OF A BANGED UP SECONDARY. BUT YOU HAVE TO GET THE THREE STOPS. CONVENTIONAL KICK HERE. CONVENTIONAL AS OF THIS YEAR, ANYWAY. NOW IT IS UP TO THE D. KIRK: THE ONLY WILDCARD I WILL SAY IS THE KYLE SHANAHAN FACTOR. CONVENTIONAL WISDOM SAYS THREE RUNS, MAKE SEATTLE USE THEIR TIMEOUTS. BUT SOMETIMES HE IS ONE STEP AHEAD OF YOU. IT WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME IF AT SOME POINT BEFORE THIRD DOWN, A THROW. AL: AGGRESSIVENESS IS IN HIS DNA. BERENDO IS THE RUNNING BACK. THEY START ON THE GROUND. HE IS OUT IN FRONT, DOWN THE SIDELINE, BEING CHASED, ONE MAN TO BEAT. THAT MAN STOPS AND BUT AT THE OR OF ALL THE CRAZY THINGS, A 76 YARD RUN. NOW SEATTLE TAKES A TIMEOUT. KIRK: AGAIN, THIS OUTSIDE ZONE, YOU THINK IT IS GOING TO BOUNCE. HERE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF GETTING TAKEN AWAY. OPEN SEE HOLE FOR THE BACK. LOOK AT A BEAUTIFUL VIEW OF IT RIGHT THERE. THE RIGHT GUARD DOES A GOOD JOB OF OPENING IT UP. HOW ABOUT THE SMART PLAY. HE TOOK A DIVE TO JUST KEE WORKING THE CLOCK. AL: KAREN THE -- GUERENDO WITH SPD EXHIBITED AT THE,. THE ROOKIE OUT OF LOUISVILLE. THE 49ERS TONIGHT HAVE RUSHED FOR 224 YARDS. KIRK: HOW ABOUT SHANAHAN RIGHT THEY KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO RUN IT AND YOU OPEN THAT UP. AL: YOU LOSE JORDAN MASON FOR MOST OF THE GAME. GOOD FIRST HALF EFFORT. ONE CARRY IN THE SECOND HALF. USING TAYLOR A LOT. THERE IS MASON. TAYLOR HAS BEEN DOING THE BULK OF THE BUYER -- BALL CARRYING. KIRK: IT IS AMAZING, THE BIG CONVERSATION WITH KYLE SHANAHAN AND HIS TEAM HAS BEEN WHEN WILL CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY BE ABLE TO COME BACK? ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS IN THE LEAGUE. YOU DO NOT HAVE MITCHELL. MASON IS TECHNICALLY YOUR THIRD TAYLOR COMES IN, HE IS YOUR FIFTH GOT. ALL OF THESE GUYS HAVE CARRIED THE FOOTBALL. TALK ABOUT DEPTH IN THE AL: SECOND AND GOAL. JUSZCZYK. THAT WILL SEAL THE DEAL. KIRK: WHERE IS SHE? AL: THIS TIME SAMUEL JOINS THE PARTY. KITTLE AS WELL. ONE MORE TIME. KIRK: THAT IS TO GOOD. HE WAS MORE FOCUSED ON THAT. WHAT A JOB BY THIS OFFENSE WITH A GAME ON THE LINE. EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU'RE GOING TO RUN. THE OLD SCHOOL FULLBACK DIVE. HOW FITTING OF A WAY THIS 49ERS TEAM TO DO THIS. A GREAT WAY TO FINISH THIS ON AL: EXTRA POINT IS GOOD. HE HAS HAD A PERFECT NIGHT IN HIS 49ER DEBUT. JUSZCZYK RIGHT THERE. 36-24. THEY REHEARSED IT EARLIER. AND THEN THE REPLAY. KIRK: THAT IS GOOD. AL: EACH TEAM COMES OFF A GUT WRENCHING LOSS. ARIZONA KNOCKING OFF SAN THEY WILL COME OUT OF HERE WITH A HUGE VICTORY TO GET BACK TO 3-3 AND DROP SEATTLE TO 3-3. ARIZONA, WHO KNOWS? KIRK: YES. AL: WHO KNOWS. FEEL, DON'T THEY? AL: DEFINITELY. SEATTLE WILL GO TO ATLANTA NEXT BUFFALO COMES HERE AND THE RAMS COME HERE. WILLIAMS WILL RUN THIS. KIRK: ANOTHER KICKER HAD TO MAKE A TACKLE. HE IS NOT HAPPY. HE GOT POUNDED. HE FELT THAT. HE WAS ON A COUCH LAST WEEK AND NOW HE JUST GOT RUN OVER. HE IS FEELING IT. HE THREW EVERYTHING HE HAD INTO AL: WE WERE TALKING TO KYLE LAST WEEK, DON'T YOU TELL YOUR KICKER? HE SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I HAVE GOTTEN BURNED. SMITH DANCING IN THE POCKET. HE THROWS INCOMPLETE. SMITH-INJIGBA THE INTENDED RECEIVER -- INTENDED RECEIVER. MCCAFFREY, LAST WEEK HE WAS ON THE INJURY REPORT. YOU CAN FIGURE THAT OUT. THERE IS NO REAL TIMELINE SCHEDULED TO BRING HIM BACK. I WAS TALKING TO JOHN LYNCH. THEY HOPE MAYBE A FEW WEEKS. WE WILL SEE. KIRK: THAT IS THE FEAR. WITH AN INJURY LIKE THAT. NOBODY KNOWS HIS BODY BETTER THAN CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY. THE WAY HE TAKES CARE OF IT YEAR-ROUND. HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE TEAM TO MAKE A STRETCHER ON. WE MIGHT BE DEALING WITH A SHOULDER INJURY. AL: HE HAS 10 DAYS TO RECOVER. WHATEVER IT IS. JOHN LYNCH, WHAT A CAREER HE HAD. ALL OF FAME. WENT INTO BROADCASTING. HAD A CHANCE TO COME BACK TO SAN FRANCISCO AND TAKE THIS JOB. THEY HAVE BEEN TO FOUR OF THE LAST FIVE IN AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES. KIRK: JUST AS FAR AS PUTTING THE SAME KIND OF PRODUCT OUT THERE YEAR AFTER YEAR. AL: THE NINERS OR A REGAL FRANCHISE. BILL WALSH WAS SO MUCH A PART OF SO GOOD OF LATE. THE FLAG STOPS THE PLAY. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT. EARLIER TODAY. FALSE START, OFFENSE, NUMBER 19. STILL FIRST DOWN. AL: WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE 49ERS, FIVE SUPER BOWL VICTORIES. BUT NONE IN 30 YEARS. KIRK: I WAS SHOCKED WHEN YOU SAID THAT. IT FEELS LIKE THEY ARE HOVERING AROUND IT EVERY YEAR. AL: THEY ARE. HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SEAL THE DEAL SINCE THE 1994 SEASON. FINALLY A SACK. FIRST OF THE GAME. KIRK: I THINK IT IS WORTH SAYING. SOME OF THEIR OWN MEDIA WAS FRUSTRATED WITH THE WAY THEY PLAY LAST WEEK. THEY WERE TESTED. THE CROWD GOING WILD. DESPITE ALL THOSE INJURIES. AL: SECOND AND 23. GREEN MAKES THE TACKLE ON FANT. DOWN TO 20 SECONDS. KIRK: SEATTLE WITH A NEW COACH, NEW COORDINATORS. INTERESTING TO SEE WHERE THEY GO FROM HERE. I THINK THIS OFFENSE HAS A REAL CHANCE. AL: SMITH LAUNCHING. 11 SECONDS. BROCK PURDY TONIGHT. IT IS ALMOST LIKE HIS PERSONALITY. THE NUMBERS ARE GOOD. THREE TOUCHDOWNS. THERE HE GOES. WHAT WAS I DOING GETTING INVOLVED IN THAT TACKLE? WHY? DID NOT MISS A TICK. THE NINERS ERASED THAT TASTE FROM A BETTER LOSS. YOU GET RID OF THAT BAD TASTE. KIRK: NOW YOU HAVE 10 DAYS TO GET READY BEFORE YOU GET KANSAS CITY. HOPEFULLY A CHANCE TO RECOVER ON SOME OF THOSE INJURIES. AL: NOBODY CAN APPRECIATE SECONDARY PLAY MORE THAN JOHN LYNCH. NOBODY. THE 49ERS ROLL INTO
