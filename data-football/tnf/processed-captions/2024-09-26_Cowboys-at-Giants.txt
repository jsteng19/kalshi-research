THE GIANTS. MEANWHILE, THE GIANTS WON THE TOSS, THEY WILL DEFER. GREG JOSEPH TO KICK OFF. #9 IS A TOP-NOTCH RECEIVER WHO WILL NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE AS IT BOUNCES THROUGH THE END ZONE. DAK PRESCOTT, THE HIGHEST-PAID PLAYER IN THE LEAGUE AT $60 MILLION. HE HAS WON HIS LAST 12 STARTS AGAINST THE GIANTS. 26 TD'S, SIX PICKS. THE COWBOYS HAVE TO GET OFF TO A FASTER START. WE WILL SEE ZEKE ELLIOTT, THEY GIVE IT TO DOWDEN WHO TURNS IT INTO A 7 YARD GAME. KIRK: DAK, IN HIS NINTH YEAR CONTROLLING THIS OFFENSE, HAD A CAREER YEAR LAST YEAR. HE WOULD BE THE FIRST WANT TO TELL YOU, HE TALKED ABOUT IT LAST WEEK HOW THEY ARE ANXIOUS TO GET BACK ON THE FIELD. THIS SHORT WEEK CAME AT THE RIGHT TIME. AL: SECOND AND FOUR, BUT GOING NOWHERE, SMOTHERED. NICK MCCLOUD COMES UP FROM THE SECONDARY. IT WILL BE THIRD AND 5, AFTER A LOSS OF ONE. KIRK: THE NEW DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR REALLY SURPRISED A LOT OF PEOPLE LAST WEEK, DIALING UP MORE PRESSURE. BACK HOME ON A SHORT WEEK, GETTING HIS DEFENSE DIALED IN AGAINST THIS RUNNING GAME. AL: FLANKING BACK, PRESCOTT ON THE MOVE THROWS INCOMPLETE. THE CROWD ALREADY ROARING AS ISAIAH SIMMONS PUT THE PRESSURE ON. IT IS VERY FAST, 1:07 THIRD AND OUT. KIRK: NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE BANKS, BUT WORKING OUT TO THE FLAT TO TRY TO HELP IN CASE OF THE INSIDE ROUTE FROM CEEDEE LAMB. THEY ARE TRYING TO ILLUMINATE -- ELIMINATE HIM BEING A FACTOR. AL: THE FAIR CATCH IS MADE AT THE 15 YARD LINE. BIG BLUE STARTS FROM THERE. HERE COMES DANIEL JONES, NUMBER SIX OVERALL PICK IN 2019. THE LAST TWO GAMES, VERY GOOD, FOUR TDS AND NO PICKS. KIRK: HE HAS ATHLETIC ABILITY, THE ABILITY TO RUN. LAST WEEK, THE FILM WOULD SHOW, LAMAR JACKSON IS 1-1 BUT I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED WITH THE ATHLETIC ABILITY TO MIX IT IN EARLY AND GET HIS FEET SETTLED. GET HIS CONFIDENCE GOING. AL: NABERS TOP OF THE SCREEN. A 5 YARD GAME UP TO THE 20 YARD LINE FOR SINGLE TERRY. KIRK: DABOLL COMES OUT WITH I FORMATION WITH JOHNSON LINED UP. THEY WILL TRY TO TEST THAT DALLAS DEFENSIVE HAD A HARD TIME DEFENDING THE RUN. AL: THE RUNNING BACK IS TYRONE TRY SEE ON A SECOND DOWN AND FIVE. EXTRA PROTECTION IN THE BACKFIELD. TRACY GOING NOWHERE. BUNCHED UP AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. THE GIANTS ARE FACED WITH A THIRD DOWN AND 5. KIRK: YOU CAN SEE THE LINEBACKER GETTING DOWNHILL. IF YOU ARE WONDERING WHAT MIKE ZIMMER MENTIONED EARLIER, HERE IS THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, THE BIG THINK HE WOULD TALK TO YOU ABOUT IS THE INTERIOR GETTING OFF OF BLOCKS IS IMPORTANT. THE LINEBACKER HAS TO GET DOWNHILL TO HELP OUT WITH THE OFFENSIVE LINE. AL: JONES BACK TO THROW, WIDE OPEN IS NABERS. WIDE OPEN. 10 YARDS. HE STARTS HIS CAREER THAT WAY AND YOU LET HIM RUN FREE DOWN THE LEFT SIDE LINE. KIRK: CARSON IS OUT SO BOOTH IS IN FOR HIM, GIVES HIM A DOUBLE MOVE. YOU TALK ABOUT DABOL AGGRESSIVE, THAT HIS THIRD DOWN, HE GOES AFTER THE INEXPERIENCED CORNER AND TEST SAME WITH YOUR BEST WEAPON. AL: BOOTH GOT FAKED OUT TOTALLY, 39 YARD GAME. GIANTS TO THE 40 OF DALLAS. TO THE LEFT SIDE ON THE GROUND. GOING NEXT TO NOWHERE IS SINGLETARY. BOOTH MAKING THE TACKLE. DABOLL WAS THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR IN BUFFALO. KIRK: THEY LIKE TYRONE CS WELL. SINGLETARY FITS IN PERFECTLY. YOU CAN GET IN FRONT OF THAT NEW OFFENSIVE LINE AND GIVE YOU BIG YARDS IN SHORT YARDAGE SITUATIONS. AL: CARSON IS ON THE SIDELINE. SECOND AND 7. JONES WILL KEEP IT, A GOOD RUNNER. ABOUT TWO YARDS SHY OF THE FIRST DOWN, AND WE HAVE A FLAG, THE FIRST OF THE GAME. THE REFEREE IS CLAY MARTIN. ONE OFFICIAL INDICATING A FACEMASK. SOMETIMES IT CAN BE OVERRULED BY SOMEBODY ELSE. >> DURING THE RUN, PERSONAL FOUL, FACEMASK, #82, OFFENSE. 15 YARD PENALTY. AL: THAT IS THE GIANTS TIGHT END, DANIEL BELANGER. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THIRD AND 2, COMES BACK 15. KIRK: WE TALKED ABOUT THE ZONE READ, HITTING HIM ON THE EDGE. YOU SEE THE FACEMASK. ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN BELANGER. THAT DRIVE WAS GOING WELL. IT WAS GOING WELL CONTROLLING THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, NOW BEHIND THE STICKS. AL: THIRD AND 2 BECOMES SECOND AND 18. FIVE WIDE HERE. QUICKLY LEFT SIDE. ROBINSON MAKES THAT CATCH AT THE 41 YARD LINE. IT WILL BE THIRD AND 11 FOR THE GIANTS. KIRK: YOU HAVE TREVON DIGGS BACK ON THE ACL A YEAR AGO, ONE OF THE TOP CORNERS IN THE LEAGUE, AND YOU HAVE BOOTH, WHO HAS NOT PLAYED A TON WHO IS IN AND DABOLL GOING AFTER HIM. WHAT WILL THEY DO WITH SAFETY SUPPORT OVER THE TOP. THEY WILL CLEARLY CHALLENGE #25 TONIGHT. AL: THREE RECEIVERS TO THE RIGHT SIDE. THE BLITZ COMES AND JONES IS FORCED TO THROW QUICKLY, THE CATCH IS MADE SHORT OF THE FIRST. THE BALL NOW AT THE 33 YARD LINE. THAT WILL SET UP A FOURTH AND 4. KIRK: JONES DID A GOOD JOB TO KEEP THE PLAY ALIVE. THEY BROUGHT WILSON UP THE MIDDLE AND HE GOT THROUGH CLEAN BUT ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND GET THE BALL OUT. AL: GREG JOSEPH HAS BEEN AROUND. HE MISSED HIS ONLY FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT LAST WEEK, THIS IS GOOD. THE GIANTS GET ON THE BOARD 3-0ACROSS THE EAST RIVER INTO MANHATTAN, WE ARE 8 MILES FROM MANHATTAN, ACROSS THE HUDSON RIVER IN THE MEADOWLANDS. THE GIANTS ON TOP, AND ANOTHER KICKOFF INTO THE END ZONE, AND A FLAG IS DOWN. SPEAKING OF FLAGS, WE WILL SHOW YOU SOMETHING IN A SECOND ABOUT THE LAST CALL ON THE FACEMASK. MAYBE SOMEBODY MOVED AT THE 30 YARD LINE. >> ILLEGAL FORMATION, #1 OF THE RECEIVING TEAM. FIRST DOWN. KIRK: WE WERE TRYING TO FIND A PENALTY AND IF BELANGER GOT INTO THE FACEMASK OF THE LINEBACKER, OVERSHOWN. HE NEVER TOUCHES HIS FACEMASK. #13 DOES GRAB THE FACEMASK. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FIRST AND 10 THAT THE 17 YARD LINE. AL: THEY DID NOT PUT UP MUCH OF A STINK. PASS OVER THE MIDDLE IS CAUGHT FOR A FOUR YARD GAME. CEEDEE LAMB. A GIANT IS DOWN ON HIS KNEE. LAMB UNHAPPY WITH HIS LACK OF -- UNHAPPY. HE WAS DEMONSTRATIVE ON THE BENCH. HE BASICALLY SAID DURING THE WEEK, "MY FAULT. I NEED TO CONTROL MY EMOTIONS BETTER." KIRK: PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED TO SEE HIM LOSE IT LIKE THAT. I THOUGHT IT WAS STAND UP. GREAT TO SEE HIM COME OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK AND OWN IT. AL:THEY WERE GETTING BLOWN OUT F THE SECOND WEEK IN A ROW. A LOT OF FRUSTRATION ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BALL. HE SAID THAT IS NOT THE PLAYER I AM OR THE TEAMMATE I AM. I WILL BE BETTER IN THE FUTURE. YOU SEE THAT IN COLLEGE AND YOU RARELY SEE THAT SINCE HE HAS BEEN IN THE PROS. KIRK: AS GOOD AS HE IS, HE AND DAK -- STILL FINDING THAT RHYTHM. THEY ARE JUST OFF A BEAT. AT ANY MOMENT THEY COULD GET ON THE SAME PAGE AND THEY CAN PUT UP BIG NUMBERS. AL: SECOND AND 5. DOWDLE STAYS IN. THAT IS CAUGHT BY CEEDEE LAMB. KAYLEE: CEEDEE TOLD ME HE WAS BEING SELFISH AND SUNDAY AND THE WAY HE LET HIS SECOND-QUARTER FUMBLE IRAQ HIS EMOTIONS -- ERUPT HIS EMOTIONS. HE SAID HE HAS DEVELOPED A NEW CHARACTER AND HOW TO APPROACH A HEATED SITUATION. HE SAID I WAS PART OF THE PROBLEM AND I WILL BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. AL: HE GETS A BREATHER. THEY HAVE DEUCE VAUGHN IN THE GAME AS THE RUNNING BACK. HE WILL MAKE THE CATCH IN THE FLAT AND OUT TO THE 45 YARD A FLAG IS DOWN. CLAY MARTIN OFF TO A BUSY START IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FOUR-YARD GAIN. REFEREE: THE PASS WAS A FORWARD PASS. PASS INT NUMBER 1. AL: THAT IS ALREADY TWO PENALTIES ON TOLBERT. HE HAD ONE ON THE KICKOFF. KIRK: THIS GIANTS SECONDARY IS UNDERMANNED TONIGHT. IT IS A BIG QUESTION HOW THEY WILL MATCH UP. THE RIGHT CALL ON TOLL BIRDS ON THE PASS INTERFERENCE -- THE RIGHT CALL ON TOLL -- TOLBERT ON THE PASS DOWNFIELD. AL: TIGHT FORMATION. A CONVOY. NICE GAIN. GETS OUT TO THE 41 YARD TACKLED BY JASON PENNOCK. KIRK: THAT IS A GOOD WAY TO GET HIM THE FOOTBALL. YOU HAVE A FULLBACK OUT IN FRONT. BEING A NATURAL BALLCARRIER. YOU KNOW WHAT THE CATCH. AL: THE COWBOYS HAVE RUN SIX PLAYS AND HALF OF THEM TO LAMB. TWO CATCHES, ONE RUN. DOWDLE BACK IN. DAK DANCING, THROWS, CAUGHT. FALLING DOWN IS THE TIGHT END JAKE FERGUSON. THAT WILL MAKE IT THIRD DOWN 3. KIRK: HE DID A REALLY NICE JOB OF SADDLING ON HIS ROUTE. IT LOOKED LIKE HE MIGHT CONTINUE THINKING IT WAS MAN-TO-MAN. INSTEAD HE COMES OFF OF IT AND SETTLES. HE RECOGNIZED OUT OF THE WAY. HIM AND DAK ON THE SAME PAGE AND NOW THEY HAVE A SHOT ON THIRD DOWN AND SHORT. AL: FOUR-MAN RUSH. DAK ESCAPES, FIRES INTO TRAFFIC AND THAT IS CAUGHT BY HUNTER LUEPKE. NUMBER 40. FULLBACK/TIGHT END/H BACK, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL HIM. KIRK: HE CAUGHT A CORNER ROUTE WHEN DAK MADE A GREAT THROW AND HERE IS ANOTHER SCRAMBLE. HE IS STARTING TO LOOK FOR 40 WHEN HE GETS INTO TROUBLE. HE IS KNOWN AS A POUNDER BUT HAS ATHLETIC ABILITY. AL: THE NEW MOOSE? 41-YARD LINE. TRYING TO CUT BACK IS RICO DOWDLE. A GAIN OF 1. RAKEEM NUNEZ-ROCHES, WHO NEEDED SOME ASSISTANCE COMING OFF THE FIELD A FEW PLAYS A STOP. KIRK: THEY HAVE SOME SIZE IN THE MIDDLE. DEXTER LAWRENCE IS A CONCERN. THERE IS A LOOK AT ZEKE ELLIOTT, WHO IS BACK IN DALLAS, WEARING NUMBER 15, HIS NUMBER IN COLLEGE. AL: QUICK THROW. NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT TO THE 30 YARD LINE HE GOES AND A FIRST DOWN, TACKLED BY BANKS. KIRK: DOES A NICE JOB OF GETTING INTO THE FACE OF DAK PRESCOTT. THIS IS THE DAK PRESCOTT OF 2023. NOT MUCH SEPARATION. MAYBE INTERFERENCE WITH THE RIGHT HAND. LOOK AT WHERE HE P AL: EIGHTS PLAY OF THE DRIVE. FIRED, CAUGHT, LAMB TO THE 32. CEEDEE, WHO HAS MADE A FOUR- CATCH GAME HIS HOMEWORK, FOUR ALREADY TONIGHT. HE HAS ALSO RUN FOR 10 YARDS. KIRK: IS IT ANY SURPRISE AFTER THE WEEK LAST WEEK? THE FRUSTRATIONS WITH DAK ON THE SIDELINE. TONIGHT THEY ARE GETTING THE FOOTBALL INTO AND OFTEN. AL: SECOND AND 6. QUICK THROW. TACKLED IS TOLBERT INSIDE THE 30 KIRK: A LOT OF US ARE ANXIOUS TO SEE OUTSIDE OF CEEDEE LAMB, WE KNOW ABOUT JAKE FERGUSON, THE POTENTIAL OF BRANDIN COOKS AND OTHER WEAPONS IN THIS OFFENSE THAT CAN EMERGE. PEOPLE HOPING TOLBERT AND OTHERS CAN DO THAT. AL: EVEN TURBINE -- EVEN TURPIN COULD SEE MORE ACTION. PRESCOTT FIRES, CAUGHT! COOKS. FIRST AND GOAL. TYLER NUBIN, THE ROOKIE OUT OF MINNESOTA, SAVE THE TOUCHDOWN. KIRK: WATCH HOW HE USES JAKE FERGUSON AS A SHIELD. HE GETS BEHIND HIM AND MAKES IT VERY TOUGH FOR HIM TO COME OFF. ALMOST A SCREEN SET BY THE BIG TIGHT END. LOOK AT DAK PRESCOTT. AL: HE IS 8-8 ON THIS DRIVE. GIVE IT TO DOWDLE. HE GETS INTO THE 5. DEXTER LAWRENCE, BIG NUMBER 97 WITH THE STOP. SECOND DOWN AND GOAL FROM THE GIANTS 5-YARD LINE. COOPER BEEBE MOVED TO CENTER, MATCHED UP AGAINST THE BEST NOSE GUARD IN THE NFL. EXTENDS WITH HIS ARMS. MAKES THE PLAY. AL: DAK COMES UP IN THE PISTOL. SECOND AND GOAL. SURVEYS, FIRES, TIPPED, INCOMPLETE. OKEREKE BREAKING IT UP AT THE GOAL LINE. FLAG. KIRK: WE HAVE A HOLD BY THE ROOKIE LEFT TACKLE. REFEREE: HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER 60. DOWN. KIRK: TYPICALLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF BRIAN BURNS. HE COMES AROUND WITH SOME SPEED. IF YOU ARE CONCERNED WITH LAWRENCE ON THE INSIDE, YOU WILL LEAVE A ROOKIE ON THE OUTSIDE. AL: SECOND DOWN AND GOAL FROM THE 15-YARD LINE. THIBODEAUX ON ONE SIDE, BRIAN BURNS, WHO THEY GOT FROM CAROLINA, NUMBER 0, ON THE OTHER. SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. ANOTHER FLAG IS DOWN. FLAG DOWN AT THE 10 YARD LINE. KIRK: I THINK IT WILL BE ANOTHER HOLD THAT WILL BRING THIS ONE BACK. GOOD, TOUGH RUNNING AFTER THE CATCH BY DOWDLE, RUNNING THROUGH THE ARM TACKLE OF MCFADDEN INTO THE END ZONE BUT I THINK IT WILL COME BACK. AL: COWBOYS ALREADY BACK AND RE-HUDDLING. REFEREE: THERE IS NO FOUL ON THE PLAY, THE RESULT OF THE PLAY IS A TOUCHDOWN. AL: WOW. THE COWBOYS WERE READY TO HUDDLE, FIGURING IT WAS ON THEM. BRIAN DABOLL IS SAYING, "WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?" KIRK: BABY HE GETS HOLD OF THE JERSEY -- MAYBE HE GETS HOLD OF THE JERSEY. THEY PICK IT UP AFTER TALKING IT OVER AND DALLAS GETS THE TOUCHDOWN. AL: REPLAY ASSIST HELPING TO MAKE THE CALL. BRANDON AUBREY WITH THE EXTRA POINT, WHICH IS AUTOMATIC. WITH 2:06 TO GO IN THE FIRST QUARTER, BRIAN DABOLL IS SERIOUS. NIGHT? AL: MY MEMORY OF THAT NIGHT WAS MY HEART WAS POUNDING LIKE CRAZY. I SAID TO FRANK IT HAS ALREADY BEEN A LONG YEAR. WE WILL GET A RUN BACK. INSIDE THE 5-YARD LINE BY TYRONE FOR CP. OUT TO THE 22 YARD LINE. KIRK: I THOUGHT 1986 GIANTS, THAT WAS IN THEIR HEYDAY. AL: PHILL SIMMS. BILL PARCELLS ON ONE SIDE, TOM LANDRY ON THE OTHER. PHILL SIMMS HAD A PHENOMENAL DAY IN PASADENA, GOING 22-25. OPRAH MADE HER SYNDICATED DEBUT THE SAME DAY. FIRST AND 10 FROM THE 23 YARD SINGLE TERRY IS THE RUNNING FROM THE I-FORMATION. SINGLE TERRY WILL TAKE THE BALL OUT TO THE 27 YARD LINE. A GAIN OF FOUR. SECOND DOWN AND 6. KIRK: LAST SERIES THEY HAVE A TOUGH PENALTY THAT WHEN AGAINST THEM. DANIEL JONES WAS 3-3 FOR 53 YARDS. A BIG EMPHASIS ON THE SHORT WEEK OF STOPPING THE RUN, BEING MORE SINGLE. CHALLENGING. AL: SINGLETARY AGAIN. STUFFED AT THE 30 YARD LINE. ERIC KENDRICKS. THEY PICKED HIM UP IN HIS 10TH SEASON IN THE LEAGUE. THIRD AND 3. KIRK: HE IS ALMOST LIKE A COACH WITH MIKE ZIMMER COMING OVER. HE SPENT SO MUCH TIME WITH HIM IN MINNESOTA. IT IS HELPING THIS DEFENSE TO LISTEN TO NUMBER 50. HE MAKES ADJUSTMENTS ON THE FLY. BE VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS DEFENSE. AL: JONES TO THE OUTSIDE. A GREAT STEP BY ROBINSON TO PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN. HE HAD HIM INITIALLY, JOURDAN LEWIS WAS THERE. A FIRST DOWN. KIRK: LOOK AT THE MOTION. HE TRIES TO COMMUNICATE. YOU SEE THE ADJUSTMENT BY THE DALLAS DEFENSE. THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO REACT QUICKLY ENOUGH. THAT IS WHAT WAN'DALE ROBINSON BRINGS TO THE TABLE. AL: 20 SECONDS UNTIL THE END OF THE QUARTER. NABERS. LOOKED LIKE HE WAS READY TO THROW BUT PACKS IT IN AND THEY CHASE HIM OUT OF BOUNDS. IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND 13. CLOCK WILL ROLL AND THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER. AL: BRIAN DABOLL IN HIS THIRD SEASON. COACH OF THE YEAR TWO YEARS AGO. 7-12 SINCE. AL MICHAELS, KIRK, KAYLEE HARTUNG AS WE START THE SECOND DANIEL JONES IS 4 FOR HIS FIRST 4, FOR 57 YARDS. ROBINSON HAS CAUGHT THREE. GOING EMPTY. NABERS IN THE SLOT TO THE LEFT. JONES LOOKS THAT WAY, FIRES THAT WAY TO THE 35. NABERS MAKES THE GRAB. HE DROPPED IT. IT REMAINS THIRD DOWN AND 14. KIRK: MIKE ZIMMER IS DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB OF ROTATING EARLY IN THIS GAME. YOU SEE DIFFERENT DEFENSIVE LINEMEN RUNNING ON IT OFF THE FIELD. THEY LOST SO MANY FAMILIAR FACES FROM LAST YEAR. AL: THIRD DOWN AND 14. JUMPING ACROSS. A FREE PLAY COMING. FLAG DOWN. DOWN THE FIELD, IT IS PICKED OFF BUT WE KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN. THAT IS DIGGS FOR THE MOMENT BUT THE COWBOYS KNOW WHAT THE STORY WILL BE. CARL LAWSON TIM ACROSS EARLY. REFEREE: OFFSIDES, DEFENSE, NUMBER 55. REPLAY THIRD DOWN. KIRK: GOOD HARD COUNT ENDS UP PULLING LAWSON OVER. HE KNEW HE HAD A FREE PLAY. HE WAS BEHIND DIGGS. DIGGS PLAYS IT WELL LIKE A RECEIVER BUT IF HE PUTS IT OUT IN FRONT DOWNFIELD, THAT POTENTIALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A HUGE PLAY. AL: LAWSON TODAY. KIRK: STILL THIRD AND 10. AL: THIRD DOWN AND 9. NABERS AND DIGGS MATCHED UP, TOP OF THE SCREEN. JONES LOOKS THE OTHER WAY. THAT IS CAUGHT BY ROBINSON. GREAT MOVE! NEEDED NINE, GOT 11. BROKE AWAY FROM ERIC KENDRICKS. ROBINSON ALREADY WITH FOUR TARGETS AND FOUR CATCHES. KIRK: HE HAS A REAL CHANCE TO COMPLEMENT WHAT NABERS CAN DO. HE CAN MAKE ERIC KENDRICKS MISS. HE STILL HAS ANOTHER SEVEN YARDS TO GO TO PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN. AL: PLAY-ACTION. HANGS IN THE POCKET. FIRES! CAUGHT, SPINNING, SLATON. JUGGLES, OUT OF BOUNDS. KIRK: THIS IS A GREAT JOB OF PICKING THE BLITZ UP IN THE BACKFIELD BY SINGLETARY. HE WILL PICK UP THIS NICKEL BLITZED BY LEWIS AND THAT ALLOWS DANIEL JONES TO GET HIS FEET SET. RIGHT OVER THE LINEBACKER KENDRICKS. YOU LOVE TO SEE ANOTHER GIANTS RECEIVER MAKING A CATCH. DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO KEEP NUMBER 11 OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. AL: 28 YARD GAIN. GOING FIVE WIDE HERE. RUSH FOUR. JONES DEEP. PULLED IN AT THE 2-YARD LINE. WE HAVE ANOTHER FLAG, THOUGH. KIRK: I DO NOT THINK THE GIANTS WERE SET. THEY HAD MOVEMENT BY THE ROOKIE TIGHT ENDS. AL: THE TEAMS ARE WALKING BACK UP THE FIELD. REFEREE: ILLEGAL SHIFT, OFFENSE. THERE WERE TWO PLAYERS MOVING AT THE SAME TIME AND NUMBER 29 DID NOT RESET PRIOR TO THE SNAP. AL: THAT WAS TRACY. KIRK: YOU HAD THE ROOKIE TRACY AND THE ROOKIE JOHNSON. MAKING SURE THEY UNDERSTOOD THEY WERE ON THE RIGHT PAGE. ONCE HE COMES OUT, IT WAS A RUNNING BACK THE PLAYED RECEIVER EARLY AT IOWA. LOOK AT THEM COMMUNICATING. BY THE TIME THEY FIGURED OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON, THE BALL IS SNAPPED AND THEY ARE NOT SET. AL: FIRST AND 15. ON THE GROUND. A GAIN OF A YARD. ERIC GRAY. THEY GO WITH THREE BACKS WHO CAN CARRY THE BALL -- SINGLETARY, TRACY AND GRAY. AND THEN YOU HAVE NABERS. KIRK: GREAT JOB BY DALLAS. THE HUGE STORY HAS BEEN WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE INTERIOR OF THE COWBOYS DEFENSE. THAT IS THEIR JOB -- EAT UP THE FREE. AL: SECOND AND 14. JONES FLUSHED. JONES FIRES ON THE RUN. 26 YARD LINE. WAN'DALE ROBINSON MAKING ANOTHER CATCH TO SET UP A THIRD DOWN AND 9. JONES HAS COMPLETED SEVEN PASSES TONIGHT IN EIGHT ATTEMPTS, FIVE OF THOSE TO ROBINSON. AND NOW THEY ARE GOING TO HELP PARSONS OFF TO THE SIDELINE. THE OFFICIALS SEE THAT HE TOOK A BLOW. THAT IS NORMALLY NOTED FROM OFF THE FIELD. KIRK: HE STAYED DOWN AFTER THE COLLISION. IT WAS NEAR THE END OF THE PLAY. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FRIENDLY FIRE FROM ONE OF HIS OWN PLAYERS. AS HE COMES OVER AT THE END, YOU WILL SEE A COWBOYS PLAYER COME DOWN ON TOP OF HIM. HE STAYED DOWN FOR A MOMENT AND THAT IS WHY TH HIM OFF. JONES FIRES. A LITTLE BEHIND NABERS, REACHES BACK AND MAKES THE CATCH. THAT BRINGS UP A FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: HOW ABOUT THAT PLAY IN THE LINEBACKER, OVERSHOWN. YOU KNOW THE ARE GOING TO TRY TO GET IT TO NABERS. OVERSHOWN PLAYED SOME SAFETY AT TEXAS. THAT IS A TOUGH TACKLE TO MAKE AGAINST NABERS. HE IS PHYSICAL, HE IS QUICK. AL: GREG JOSEPH NOW TO TRY TO MAKE IT 7-6. 41-YARD ATTEMPT. SNAP A LITTLE HIGH. HE GETS IT DOWN. PLAY WITH PARSONS NEAR THE END, TRIES TO GET INVOLVED IN A TACKLE, MAZI SMITH TRYING TO FINISH IT OFF. A COLLISION AT THE END. HIS LOWER HALF MAYBE HIT THE HEAD OF PARSONS. PARSONS DID NOT AGREE BUT HE WAS TAKEN OFF THE FIELD. AL: HE IS IN THE BLUE TENT. WE WILL GET A REPORT AS SOON AS WE CAN. JOSEPH TO KICK OFF. COWBOYS ON TOP, 7-6. EACH TEAM COMING IN GAME THUS FA EZEKIEL ELLIOTT IS IN THE ZEKE CAME UP AS A ROOKIE END LEAD THE LEAGUE IN RUSHING. FOURTH OVERALL PICK. KAYLEE: MICAH PARSONS WAS HANDED HIS HELMET BACK. HE IS SITTING ON THE BENCH. WE DO NOT HAVE CONFIRMATION ON HIS STATUS. THEY BROUGHT EVERYONE IN THE BLUE TENT THEY COULD FIT, INCLUDING THE TRAUMA CONSULTANT. HE IS OUT OF THE TENT AND BACK ON THE SIDELINE. AL: AND WITH HIS HELMET. GOOD NEWS FOR THE COWBOYS. SECOND DOWN AND 5. TAKEN DOWN IN THE BACKFIELD IS PRESCOTT AFTER THE FAKE HANDOFF. DALLAS FACED WITH A THIRD DOWN AND 5. KIRK: I WONDER IF THIS IS A READ. IF IT IS A READ, HE MAKES THE WRONG READ. HE IS READING 51. IF HE STAYS WIDE, YOU HAVE TO HAND THE BALL TO ZEKE ELLIOTT. AL: PRESSURE. CAUGHT, CAN HE GET THE FIRST DOWN? LOSES THE BALL AS HE GOES OUT OF BOUNDS. OFFICIALS READY TO SPOT IT A LITTLE BIT SHORT. FERGUSON MAKING THE GRAB. TACKLE IS MADE BY NUBIN. THEY WILL MARKET JUST SHY OF THE 40 IN WITHOUT A HUDDLE. KIRK: UNDER CENTER. YOU EXPECT THEM TO SNEAK IT. AL: INSTEAD, STARTS THE HARD COUNT. WILL THEY REALLY GO? THEY WILL. THE FULLBACK. HERE GOES LUEPKE AGAIN! STARTED TO LOSE HIS BALANCE BUT KEPT AND GOT TO THE 45 YARD GOT THROUGH A WOULD BE TACKLED BY THIBODEAUX WHI CREATED A TURNOVER ON DOWNS. KIRK: IT OPENS UP THE EDGE. LUEPKE SHOWING OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS, YOU ARE NOT USED TO SEEING A LOT OF FULLBACKS BEING ABLE TO SHOW WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH THE BALL IN HIS HANDS. HE HAS THAT ABILITY. AL: SECOND YEAR OUT OF NORTH DAKOTA STATE. HERE GOES LAMB. HE IS FREE ON THE INSIDE. CEEDEE LAMB, TOUCHDOWN. FOR A CHANGE, NO FLAG. HE GOT AWAY FROM BANKS. NOW THEY SAY THERE IS A FLAG AT THE END. WHERE IS IT? IT IS DOWN OF THE GOAL LINE. YOU NEVER WANT WITH THIS CREW. KIRK: RIGHT. AL: THEY HUDDLE. IS IT AFTER HE SCORED? REFEREE: THE RESULT OF THE PLAY IS A TOUCHDOWN. AFTER THE PLAY, UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT, TAUNTING, NUMBER 88, DALLAS. THIS IS HIS FIRST TOWARD DISQUALIFICATION. 15-YARD PENALTY W ON THE TRY. KIRK: LOOK AT THE SAFETIES PRE-SNAP. MIDDLEFIELD SAFETY, ONE ON ONE. REALLY WELL DONE BY DAK PRESCOTT. SAFETY COMES DOWN. BLITZ. ONE-ON-ONE ON ONE, YOU HAVE TO GO TO CEEDEE LAMB. TAKE IT EVERY TIME AGAINST BANKS AND HE WINS IT. AL: AND THEN, TAUNTING, I GUESS. THIS MAKES IT A 48-YARD EXTRA POINT. FOR AUBREY, THAT IS REMOTE ISSUE. THE COWBOYS GET THE TD. 9:16 TO GO IN THE FIRST HALF AND THEY LEAD 14-6 ON THURSDAY FOOTBALL. AND BRANDON AUBREY KICKED A 65- YARD FIELD GOAL LAST SUNDAY. HE HITS A LINE DRIVE TO THE 5. KIRK: LET'S TAKE A PEEK AT PARSONS SO FAR. GIANTS ARE WELL AWARE OF HIM. THEY ID HIM. ZONE READ. ANOTHER ONE WHERE YOU ARE KEEPING HIM UNTOUCHED, MAKING HIM MAKE A DECISION. ZERO PRESSURES. HE HAS ONLY BEEN DOUBLE-TEAMED ONCE. HE STAYS HOME WELL, CHASES HE IS OFF, STILL, HOLDING HIS HELMET. AL: SINGLETARY. SLIPS TO THE OUTSIDE, BALL IS OUT BUT THEY WILL SAY HE WAS DOWN BY CONTACT. KENDRICKS RIGHT THERE. DOWN BY CONTACT, GAIN OF TWO. REFEREE: THE RULE ON THE FIELD IS A RUNNER WAS DOWN BY CONTACT. AL: SINGLETARY HAS FUMBLED IN EACH OF HIS LAST TWO GAMES AND HAS 16 IN HIS CAREER. KIRK: HE TALKED ABOUT IT THIS WEEK. THE BALL, IS IT STARTING TO COME OUT? NO. AL: THE KNEE IS DOWN. CHALLENGE THIS. AL: YOU SEE WHAT WE SEE. KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE IT STARTED TO MOVE BUT IT WAS NOT CLEAR. SURFACE. AL: MEANWHILE, SINGLETARY WORKED ON. REFEREE: DALLAS IS CHALLENGING THE RULING ON THE FIELD THAT THE RUNNER WAS DOWN BY CONTACT. TIMEOUT. AL: IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A TWO- YARD GAIN TO THE 30. THEY WILL CHECK IT OUT AND WE REFEREE: AFTER REVIEW, THE RULING ON THE FIELD DOES STAND AS CALLED, THE RUNNER IS DOWN BY CONTACT. THIS IS AN UNSUCCESSFUL CHALLENGE BY DALLAS. THEY WILL BE CHARGED THEIR FIRST AL: IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND 8. MEANWHILE, SINGLETARY WENT OVER TO THE SIDELINE TO GET CHECKED ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAVE MICAH PARSONS WHO WAS OUT AND IS BACK IN. KIRK: YOU HEARD HIM SAY THE KNEE WAS DOWN, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE FOCUSING ON THE ELBOW. TRACY. SECOND AND 8. JONES IS 8 OF HIS FIRST 9. PAST NUMBER 10. GOING DEEP. COVERAGE IS GREAT. BATTED AWAY. MALIK HOOKER GOT OVER THERE. YOU HAD A GREAT BATTLE GOING ON. NABERS AND DIGGS. HELP OVER THE TOP FROM HOOKER TO BAT IT AWAY. KIRK: WE KNOW NABERS IS CAPABLE OF MAKING HUGE PLAYS. YOU ARE GOING TO THROW YOU ROLL OUT AND THROW ALL THE WAY BACK. IT IS NOT JUST DIGGS, IT IS REALLY GOOD RANGE BY HOOKER, PLAYING CENTERFIELD. HE WENT 20 OR 30 YARDS TO GET OVER THERE. AL: ALABAMA COVERING LSU. THIRD DOWN AND 8. JONES SLIDES LEFT, FIRES, CAUGHT AT THE 40 YARD LINE. BROUGHT IN BY NABERS. THAT TIME, BOOTH WAS COVERING. KIRK: WHAT A JOB SELLING THIS ROUTE DOWNFIELD. HE GETS THE YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED CORNER TO TURN. HE SELLS IT, GOES BY HIM. ONCE HE TURNS HIS SHOULDERS, IT IS OVER. EVEN THOUGH IT IS THIRD AND LONG, I AM SURPRISED HE TURNED, KNOWING THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE HE WOULD WORK BACK AND TRY TO GET TO THE FIRST DOWN MARKER. AL: WITH THE FULLBACK IN THERE. LOOK OUT. FLIPPED DOWN. MAZI SMITH TAKES CARE OF TYRONE TRACY FOR NO GAIN. SECOND DOWN AND 10, HALFWAY THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER. DALLAS UP, 14-6. KIRK: THERE WAS A BIG EMPHASIS FROM MIKE ZIMMER ABOUT GETTING OFF OF BLOCKS AND TACKLING. THEY CAME IN ALLOWING 5.4 YARDS PER CARRY, DEAD LAST. TONIGHT, 2 YARDS PER CARRY. AL: THIS WAS THE DEFENSE WAS FIFTH BEST IN THE LEAGUE LAST YEAR. SECOND AND 10. CATCH MADE AT THE 42, NABERS MAKING THE GRAB. KAYLEE: MICAH PARSONS EVALUATED FOR A NECK INJURY IN THE MEDICAL TENT. THE CONCERN WAS A STINGER, AN IRRITATION OF A NERVE. THAT EXPLAINS WHY THEY NEEDED IN THE TENT WITH HIM. AL: THANK YOU, DR. HARTUNG. KIRK: ANOTHER THIRD DOWN FOR THE THEY ARE 4-6. AL: SINGLETARY BACK IN. THIRD AND 8. SLIDING LEFT AGAIN. CAUGHT AT THE 50-YARD LINE. ROBINSON, MAKING THE CATCH. THEY WILL MARK IT A LITTLE BIT SHY OF THE 50-YARD LINE, ABOUT A HALF YARD SHY OF A FIRST DOWN. OF COURSE, THE CROWD WANTS THEM TO GO FOR IT. IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WILL. KIRK: DANIEL JONES WAS ABLE TO AVOID MICAH PARSONS. THEY HAVE A GREAT SHOT OF PICKING UP THIS FIRST DOWN AT MIDFIELD. HEAVY ON THE RIGHT. AL: SINGLETARY IN THE BACKFIELD, IN TROUBLE BUT GETS HIMSELF OUT OF TROUBLE AND PICKS UP THE GOT AWAY FROM DONOVAN WILSON, WHO HAD HIM IN THE BACKFIELD. COULD NOT SECURE THE TACKLE. FIRST DOWN, NEW YORK. KIRK: THEY WENT WITH THREE TIGHT ENDS. HERE IS WILSON ON THE SHORT EDGE OF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE OFFENSE. RIGHT THERE! WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY WERE TACKLING BETTER. THAT WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNI GET OFF THE FIELD. THERE IS WHAT SINGLETARY CAN BRING. 5'7", 203. REALLY GOOD CONTACT BALANCE. SPINS OUT AND PICKS UP THE FIRST WHAT A SEQUENCE OF PLAYS FOR THE AL: MEANWHILE, YOU HAVE OVERSHOWN AND HE IS SLOW IN GETTING UP. SECOND YEAR BACKER OUT OF TEXAS. THIRD-ROUND PICK IN LAST YEAR'S DRAFT. HE WILL COME OUT FOR AT LEAST ONE PLAY. KIRK: NUMBER 13 HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE FIELD. JUST TRYING TO STRIP AT THE ONCE YOU HAVE THE REPUTATION OF BEING A FUMBLE OR, THAT DEFENSE IS DOING ANYTHING THEY C AL: YEARS AGO TIKI BARBER HAD THAT ISSUE AND TOM COUGHLIN GOT HIM TO TIGHT. KIRK: THAT IS RIGHT. AL: THE FUMBLES WENT AWAY. KIRK: OLD SCHOOL. AL: VERY. FROM THE 48-YARD LINE. PLAY-ACTION. SINGLETARY HAS SOME ROOM TO ROAM. PICKS UP 14 AND A FIRST DOWN. OSA ODIGHIZUWA MAKING THE TACKLE. KIRK: THE OFFENSE OF THE GIANTS, THERE IS SO MUCH TALK ABOUT THE SKILL WITH NABERS AND ROBINSON BUT IF I AM A GIANTS FAN, I REALLY LIKE THE THREE NEW PIECES THEY BROUGHT IN. JON RUNYAN GETTING DOWNFIELD, JOHN MICHAEL SCHMITZ, THE SECOND-YEAR CENTER. DANIEL JONES IS ABLE TO WORK IN THEY ARE ABLE TO FOOTBALL BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY HAVE UP FRONT. SO MUCH BETTER THAN THEY WERE A YEAR AGO. AL: STOPPED AFTER A GAIN OF TWO. TRACY, THE ROOKIE FROM PURDUE. PICKED HIM UP IN THE FOURTH ROUND. SECOND DOWN AND 8. KIRK: GOOD JOB OF CHANGING UP LOOKS BY BRIAN DABOLL. DIFFERENT FORMATIONS, DIFFERENT WAYS OF ATTACKING DALLAS. GIVING THEM DIFFERENT LOOKS, TRYING TO SLOW THEM DOWN WITH PRE-SNAP MOVEMENT, MOVING NABERS AROUND. AL: SECOND AND 9. AND A WHISTLE. CLAY MARTIN. REFEREE: 12 MEN IN FORMATION ON THE DEFENSE WITH THE SNAP IMMINENT. FIVE-YARD PENALTY, SECOND DOWN. KIRK: THEY HAVE BEEN ROTATING A LOT OF PLAYERS. THERE IS 11, THERE IS NUMBER 12. I JUST TALKED ABOUT HOW THE GIANTS ARE MOVING A LOT OF PLAYERS ON AND OFF THE FIELD AND OBVIOUSLY MIKE ZIMMER, WITH A NEW SCHEME, IS COMMUNICATE AND ADJUST BACK AND FORTH. THAT TIME, ONE GUY NOT ABLE TO THE FIELD. AL: SIX PENALTIES, 50 YARDS AGAINST DALLAS TO THIS POINT. 3:30 UNTIL THE HALF, SECOND DOWN AND 3. THE RIGHT SIDE. INTO TRAFFIC IS SINGLETARY. THIRD AND SHORT. KIRK: I THINK THIS DEFENSE HAS HEARD ENOUGH ABOUT HOW THEY ARE THE WEAKNESS OF THIS FOOTBALL TEAM, AT LEAST TONIGHT, THEY HAVE REALLY SHOWN UP UP FRONT AND DONE A MUCH BETTER JOB IN THE INTERIOR. THE BIGGEST THING YOU CAN SAY IS THEY ARE KEEPING THESE LINEBACKERS FREE, ESPECIALLY 50, ERIC KENDRICKS, THE VETERAN. AL: OVERSHOWN IS BACK IN. THIRD DOWN AND 3. JONES WILL KEEP, JONES WILL GET THE FIRST DOWN. DANIEL JONES TAKES IT TO THE 21-YARD LINE. STOP BY BOOTH. FIRST DOWN FOR THE GIANTS. THIS DRIVE HAS CONSUMED 6:30. THE NEXT PLAY WILL BE THE 12TH OF THE DRIVE. KIRK: GOOD JOB OF READING THAT. PICKS UP A BLOCK FROM THE ROOKIE THEO JOHNSON. DANIEL JONES, THEY WANT HIM TO BE EFFICIENT AND PLAY SMART. ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO SLOW DO PARSONS. THE ZONE READ LOOK MAKES HIM HESITANT. AL: OFF THE FAKE AGAIN TO THE OUTSIDE. DROPPING IT. FLAG IS THROWN. ROBINSON DROPPED IT. FOR THE MOMENT, TAKING IT ALL THE WAY DOWN THE FIELD WAS MALIK HOOKER. THE FLAG BACK AT THE 18-YARD EVERYONE WILL COME BACK IN THAT DIRECTION. THAT WILL ALSO TAKE US TO THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING. I AM AFRAID TO GET THE CALL. KIRK: WE HAVE A MAN DOWNFIELD FOR THE GIANTS. THAT IS WHAT THE FLAG WILL BE. THE QUESTION IS WILL IT BE INCOMPLETE? ASSISTANTS, THE PASS WAS HOWEVER, WE HAVE AN INELIGIBLE PLAYER DOWNFIELD, OFFENSE, NUMBER 72. AL: JERMAINE ELUEMUNOR. KIRK: I WAS JUST GOING TO BRAG ON WHAT A TIME TO CALL THAT. YOU BOOT AND GET IT OUT THERE AND DALLAS' EYES REFEREE: PLEASE RESET THE CLOCK TO 2:09. KIRK: HE HAD A LOT OF ROOM TO GO AROUND THE CORNER IF HE COULD SECURE IT. HERE IS THE MAN DOWNFIELD, HE IS WAY DOWN FIELD. AL: DID NOT TAKE THAT THIRD STEP, AS THE SAYING GOES. THEY PUT TIME BACK ON THE CLOCK. THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING HAS NOT OCCURRED. WE HAVE ANOTHER FLAG. IT LOOKS LIKE JUNE 14, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS FLAG DAY. CLAY MARTIN LOOKS LIKE A REFE OUT OF CENTRAL CASTING. KIRK: [LAUGHTER] HE LOOKS LIKE A YOUNG TERRY MCCAULEY OUT THERE. TERRY WAS ALWAYS TIGHT IN THE UNI, BACK IN HIS HEYDAY. AL: AFTER ALL THAT, PLAY CLOCK GETS RESET AT 25. GIANTS HAVE CONTROLLED THE QUARTER BUT STILL TRAIL BY EIGHT. FIRST AND 15 NOW. GOING TO BE SECOND AND 13 AND THAT WILL TAKE US AL: AL: THERE IS OUR GANG WORKING ON THE SHOW. WATER OUR SLEEP DEPOSIT. TACKLE MADE IMMEDIATELY COMING UP WILL BE THE 14TH PLAY FIVE OF EIGHT, DOING A GOOD JOB PROTECTING DANIEL JONES. TRYING TO MOVE AROUND, -- MOVE NABERS AROUND. AL: ROBINSON AND THE BACKFIELD. THERE IS A DEFENSIVE ALERT. AND TWO MORE SLIDES. KIRK: HE DID THREE HARD ACCOUNTS TO TRY TO PULL HIM OFF. THE THIRD WAS THE CHARM. >> NEUTRAL ZONE INFRACTION. DEFENSE, NUMBER 11. THIRD DOWN. AL: SOMEWHERE AARON RODGERS IS WATCHING THIS AND APPRECIATING THE THIRD DOWN FROM DANIEL JONES. YOU HAVE JUST ENOUGH HAND MOVEMENT ON TOP OF IT. KIRK: I THINK THAT MOTION, ALSO CAUGHT THEIR EYES A LITTLE BIT. AL: NOW WHAT? >> THE GIANTS HAVE ELECTED TO RUN THE CLOCK TO AVOID. THE COWBOYS WILL CALL A TIMEOUT. TIMEOUT ON THE FIELD. DANIEL JONES AND THE EFFICIENCY HE HAS PLAYED WITH TONIGHT. REALLY NICE THINGS. FINALLY OPEN RECEIVER, AND THAT IS GREAT OVER THE TOP OF HE HAS MOVED, HE HAS USED HIS HE IS MOVING THE BALL AROUND. IT IS NOT JUST NABERS. ROBINSON HAS HAD OPPORTUNITIES. HE'S INVOLVED IN THE RUN GAME. HE'S DOING A GOOD JOB OF MEANING IN COMMAND OF WHAT T TRYING TO EXECUTE. AL: IF YOU GET PICKED IN THE FIRST-ROUND, YOU ARE NUMBER YOU HAVE A FRANCHISE QUARTERBACK WHO RETIRES IN ELI MANNING, HAVE THE HISTORY OF GREAT CORNERBACKS HERE IN NEW YORK. IT IS LIKE THE SAGA CONTINUES. IS HE OR IS HE NOT OUR GUY? I TELL YOU WHAT, HE WILL ENJOY WATCHING HARD KNOCKS, TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING, TALKING ABOUT TRADING UP. THIRD DOWN AND 4 AFTER THAT TIMEOUT TAKEN BY THE COWBOYS AVOID A RUNOFF. THEY WILL TRY TO GET THE BALL GETS SACKED, AND HE FLAGGED HIS THROW. A HOLD AGAINST THE GIANTS. >> OFFENSE, NUMBER 72, PENALTIE DECLINED. FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: KEEP WAITING FOR PARSONS ON THESE THIRD DOWNS. HE JUST WENT RIGHT THROUGH HIM. LOOK AT THIS, POWER, HE GETS DOWN, LOOK AT THAT PUSH, THE BAND, THE ATHLETIC ABILITY, THE POWER. PARSONS CAME UP RIGHT AWAY, LOOKING AT THE OUT HERE. THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE. AL: HE HAS BEEN ON THIS TEAM FOR DECADES, JOHN. HEAD OF THE GROUP RIGHT NOW. 38 YARD FIELD GOAL, AND THAT IS GOOD. AND THEY SHOULD RECORDING. THE FLAG IS DOWN. KIRK: OFFSIDES ON DALLAS. AL: WELL, IT WAS. FOURTH AND 8. >> OFFSIDE. DALLAS, NUMBER 30. PENALTIES DECLINED. THE COWBOYS ARE GOING TO GET THE BALL. AND THEY WILL HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS. MAKE IT ONE. ONE TIMEOUT AT THEIR DISPOSAL. AND THEY HAVE BRANDON AUBREY AS THEIR FIELD KICKER. KIRK: GET IT TO YOUR OWN 45. AL: HIS RANGE. AND THROUGH THE END ZONE. KIRK: WE HAVE TALKED A LOT ABOUT MICHAEL PARSONS, AND LAWRENCE HAS BEEN DOUBLE-TEAMED, SEVEN OF NINE HIS LAST RUSH ATTEMPTS, AND YOU GET FOUR HANDS ON IT, AND THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO AGAINST THE BEST NOSE GUARD IN NFL. HE MAKES PLAYS LIKE THIS AGAINST THE RUN, COMES DOWN A BIG STEP PLAY, AND IF HE ISN'T DOUBLE-TEAMED, THE BALL IS GETTING OUT IN A HURRY. THEY JUST -- THEY JUST KIND OF BAITED HIM TOWARDS DAX PRESCOTT -- DAK PRESCOTT. AL: FAST CAUGHT, OVER THE MIDDLE, LOOKING FOR THE CAN HE GET OUT OF BOUNDS? YES, HE CAN. PICKED UP NINE, SO PRESCOTT IS 12 OF 13, AND LAMB HAS SIX ON SIX TARGETS. KIRK: DAK PRESCOTT THINKING THE FIELD GOAL RANGE, ONE TIMEOUT. THE GIANTS TRY TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN FRONT OF THEM, TWO SAFETIES BACK, FOCUSED ON TRYING TO KEEP NUMBER 88 AWAY FROM MAKING A BIG PLAY. AL: IS ONLY HE'S COMPLETED 12 IN A ROW. MAKE THAT A LUCKY 13 AS JAKE FERGUSON MAKES THE CATCH FOR A VERY SHORT GAME. PRESCOTT RINGS HIM UP TO THE LINE QUICKLY. 40 SECONDS TO HALFTIME. KIRK: ALL KIDDING ASIDE, THEY ARE FIVE YARDS AWAY FROM HAVING A SHOT WITHIN HIS RANGE. AL: NOW THEY ARE A LOT FARTHER. THAT IS THIBODEAU -- THAT IS THIBODEAUX. TIMEOUT TAKEN, AND WE ARE BACK IN 30 SECONDS. AL: I ALWAYS THOUGHT SHERMAN WAS A CAVIAR GUY. SECOND AND 18. PRESCOTT TO THE OUTSIDE. THEY HAVE TO USE THE SIDELINE HERE. BECAUSE THEY ARE OUT OF TIMEOUTS. KIRK: LET'S GO BACK TO THE PREVIOUS PLAY. THIBODEAUX AGAINST THE ROOKIE RATE HE'S LINED UP TO THE OUTSIDE AND TO GO OUTSIDE. BUT, INSTEAD, THE POWER RUSHED TO THE INSIDE, AND HE GETS HOME. AL: THIRD AND 12. THIBODEAUX CAME ACROSS THE LINE. YOU HAVE A FREE PLAY, ANOTHER PLAY, TWO MORE FLAGS IN THE HOLBORN MAIDS THE CATCH, 29 YARD LINE, AND ANY NUMBER OF CALLS COMING YOUR WAY. KIRK: YOU HAVE OFFSIDES, FREE PLAY AND THEN A HOLD BY THE LEFT TACKLE, THE ROOKIE. HE TACKLED THIBODEAUX THAT TIME. >> FOULS BY BOTH TEAMS ON THE PLAY. DEFENSE, NUMBER FIVE. HOLDING. OFFENSE, NUMBER 60, THOSE PENALTIES OFFSET, PREVIOUS REPLAY THE DOWN. KIRK: THAT TAKES THEIR SHOT AWAIT OF A FIELD GOAL. HERE HE IS JUMPING OFFSIDES. HE IS A ROOKIE AND WILL BE FINE DOWN THE ROAD, BUT ONCE HE ENDS UP JUMPING OFFSIDES, HE KEEPS HUSTLING TO MAKE A PLAY, AND HE OBVIOUSLY HAS TO END UP TRIED TO KEEP THEM AWAY FROM THE CORNERBACK. AL: THIBODEAUX COMES OFF THE FIELD FOR THE MOMENT. FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH, THE GIANTS HAVE TWO THAT ARE PROBABLY MOOT AT THIS POINT. KIRK: TWO OFFICIALS TALKING, THE MICROCOSM STILL ON THE GROUND AT THE 35 YARD LINE. THERE IS A LOT OF CLEANUP. THOSE ARE A LOT OF FLAGS. >> FOULED I THE OFFENSIVE HOLDER, NO TIMEOUT IN REGARDS TO KIRK: KEEP THIS IN MIND, 20 SECONDS, IF THEY GET TACKLED, OBVIOUSLY IN BOUNDS, THEY WILL HAVE TO SPREAD OUT TO HAVE A CHANCE AT A FIELD GOAL THIS THIRD DOWN UNLESS THEY ARE ABLE TO PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN AND SPOT THE BALL. AL: EXACTLY. SO THERE IS AUBREY, WHO IS LIVING IN ANOTHER WORLD RIGHT NOW. ALMOST NEVER MISSES, 65 YARD OR LAST WEEK. HE HAS A SHOT AND A LONG ONE NEXT. THIRD AND 12. FOUR MAN RUSH. TO THE OUTSIDE, THOUGH, BRANDON IS THE INTENDED RECEIVER, SO WITH 14 SECONDS NOW, FOURTH DOWN. IN COMES BRYAN ANGER TO PUNT. KIRK: A BIG STOP FOR THE GIANTS THEY CAUGHT A BREAK WITH THE HOLDING CALL BECAUSE DALLAS WOULD HAVE HAD A SHOT AT A FIELD GOAL BUT WITH THE GIANTS DEFERRING THE FIRST HALF, THEY GET THE FIELD GOAL, THE STOP, DOWN FIVE AND THEN THE BALL TO START THE SECOND HALF. AL: JONES WAS 13 OF 15 IN THE HALF, PRESCOTT 14 OF 16 AT 164. YOU ARE KIDDING. >> FALSE START. OFFENSE, NUMBER 30. FIVE YARD PENALTY. KIRK: IS THAT THE EIGHTH PENALTY NOW? AL: NO, THE 147TH. WHAT WAS THAT SHOT OF YOU AND FRANK GIFFORD, 1986, YOU CALLED A BUNCH OF MONDAY NIGHT, THURSDAY NIGHT, SUNDAY NIGHT, IS THIS A WORLD RECORD FOR YOU THE FIRST HALF? AL: ABSOLUTELY. WITHOUT QUESTION. GOING TO NEED SOME NEW FLAGS TO THROW IN THE SECOND HALF BECAUSE THESE ARE FILTHY. THE KICK BOUNCED INSIDE THE THERE IS ANOTHER FLAG. IN FACT, THERE ARE TWO. WE WOULD NOT LIE TO YOU. OH YEAH. WE ARE KIND OF FEELING THE SAME WAY RIGHT NOW. WITH THE SCORE. >> DALLAS, NUMBERN TO AMAZON TO ORDER NEW FLAGS. KIRK: IT IS A QUICK HALFTIME. AL: JEREMY JONES AND STEVEN JONES. THE TEAM IS AT LEAST IN THE GAME AS THEY HAVE NOT BEEN THE LAST TWO HALF TIMES, AND THAT TAKES US TO THE BREAK. THAT IS THE END OF THE FIRST HALF. WEEK, DALLAS LEADS NEW YORK 14-9 AT THE HALF, THANKS TO DAK PREER ONE HAS TURNED THE BALL OVER, I DON'T WANT TO JINX THEM, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN EFFICIENT, WHICH GUY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO PLAY THAT WAY, AND SOMEONE EVENTUALLY, ONE OF THESE DEFENSES WILL CREATE THAT TURNOVER AND WIN A FOOTBALL GAME. AL: DROPPED GREAT PICKED UP, THIS IS TRACY, AND HE GETS SMACKED, COMES OUT, AND THAT IS THE WAY THE THIRD QUARTER STARTS. KAYLEE: COACH, YOUR OFFENSE LOOKED SHARP, BUT WITH THOSE NINE ACCEPTED PENALTIES, HOW DO YOU FIX THAT? >> TOO MANY PENALTIES. WE HAVE TO CLEAN THAT UP. WE'VE HAD BIG PLAY OPPORTUNITIES SLIP THROUGH OUR FINGERS SO WE NEED TO JUMP ON THEM THE SECOND KAYLEE: YOUR RUN DEFENSE IMPROVED THE PAST TWO GAMES, WHAT CHANGED? >> WE ARE JUST FOCUSED ON THE NEXT GAME, SO OUR GUYS KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE A DIVISION GAME, GREAT ENVIRONMENT SO WE HAVE TO KEEP PLAYING. AL: SO MIKE MCCARTHY, MEANWHILE, HE RECOVERED THE GIANTS, AND STARTING ON THE GROUND, AND THAT DEFENSE, WHICH HAS ALLOWED LESS THAN TWO YARDS PER CARRY DOES IT AGAIN HERE. SINGLETARY FOR A LOSS OF THREE. KIRK: LET'S LOOK AT THAT KICKOFF RETURN BECAUSE IT HAPPENED QUICKLY. ON THE RIGHT, HE HAS BEEN EVERYWHERE ON THIS FIELD, NOT ONLY PLAYING GREAT DEFENSE BUT JUST THROWING HIS BODY IN THERE TO GET THAT BALL OUT, AND THE GIANTS ARE VERY FORTUNATE THAT HE IS ABLE TO RECOVER THAT. AL: HE SAVED THE DAY, SECOND DOWN AND 13 NOW. SINGLETARY IN MOTION TO THE JONES ASKED THAT WAY AND THEN THE OTHER WAY, AND THAT PASS UP AT THE 34 YARD LINE TO DARIUS SLAYTON. HE HOLDS THAT BABY IN FOR THE KIRK: REALLY GOOD PATIENTS BY THIS OFFENSIVE LINE IS DOING A NICE JOB OF TAKING CARE OF HIM AGAIN. WATCH HIM WORK TO THE LEFT. I THOUGHT HE MIGHT GO HERE BUT INSTEAD HE WAITS FOR THE CROSSER AND HE ENDS UP GOING DOWNFIELD A LITTLE FURTHER TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP THAT FIRST DOWN. AL: EACH CORNERBACK IS 14 OF 16. JONES STEPS UP TO THE POCKET. TO THE OUTSIDE HE GOES, AND THAT WILL BE DARIUS SLAYTON RIGHT THERE. PICKING UP THE FIRST AGAIN. AND THE GIANTS ON THE MOVE. KIRK: DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE HEAD COACH TAKING OVER THOSE PLAYCALLING DUTIES THIS YEAR. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN AS AGGRESSIVE AS I THINK HE WOULD LIKE TO BE. I THINK A LOT OF THAT IS PREDICATED UPON HOW THE FLOW OF THE GAME IS GOING AND HOW YOUR OWN DEFENSE IS PLAYING. BUT HERE MAKING ADJUSTMENTS AND THEY HAVE COME OUT GIVING THE BALL TO DANIEL JONES. AL: NABERS IS THE MAN IN MOTION. THE PASS CAUGHT BY ROBINSON, BIG FIRST HALF, STARTS WITH AN EIGHT YARD PICKUP HERE. GETS THE BALL TO DALLAS TERRITORY FOR SECOND DOWN AND 2. KIRK: ONE OF THE ADJUSTMENTS HE MADE, ALL WEEK HE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE' HOW WE'VE BEEN WATCHING DALLAS. WORST IN THE NFL AFTER THREE WEEKS. WE HAVE TO WIN THE LINE OF WE HAVE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL WITH THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL, SO NOW HE IS SAYING, THAT' SAYING, THAT'S GET THE BALL OUT QUICK AND TRY TO PROTECT THE QUARTERBACK AND ADVANTAGE OF THE WEAPONS WE HAVE ON THE OUTSIDE. AL: SECOND AND 2. SHOULD HAVE THE FIRST DOWN. THERE GOES DEVIN SINGLETARY. KIRK: ON THAT RIGHT SIDE, WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE LINE. THE RIGHT SIDE, BOTH FROM THE RAIDERS, THEY CAME OVER AND, IRONICALLY, YOU ALSO HAVE THE RAIDERS OFFENSIVE LINE COACH YOU CAME OVER. THERE IS SOME CONTINUITY ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND REALLY ON THE ENTIRE OFFENSIVE LINE, YOU WOULD THINK, WHEN YOU HAVE THREE NEW PIECES EARLY IN SEPTEMBER, YOU WILL HAVE TO WORK AND FIND A WITH THE LINE COACH COMING OVER FROM LAS VEGAS, THE RIGHT SIDE BOTH FROM VEGAS, THERE IS BUILT IN CONTINUITY. AL: THAT WAS A MAJOR PRIORITY IN THE OFF-SEASON, THAT OFFENSIVE LINE WAS A MESS LAST YEAR. TRACY TAKES THE PASS, AND HE PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN AND STAYS INBOUND. 25 YARD LINE HE GOES. ALREADY FOUR FIRST DOWNS FOR THE GIANTS ON THIS DRIVE. KIRK: AGAIN, GOOD FLOW, GOOD RHYTHM, GREAT EXECUTION. WE HAVE SEEN SINGLETARY, THAT FORMER WIDE RECEIVER IN COLLEGE, CAME OUT OF PERDUE, HE WAS IN IOWA AS A RECEIVER, VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE BALL IN HIS HANDS GETTING OUT TO THE PERIMETER AND HOW ABOUT THOSE LINEMEN COMING OVER FROM LAS VEGAS, GETTING OUT IN FRONT AND OPENING THAT THING UP? AL: GOOD PROTECTION. GOOD PASS. TO THE 10. NABERS POOLS ONE AND AGAIN. SIX CATCHES TONIGHT ON EIGHT TARGETS FOR 74 YARDS. KIRK: ISN'T IT AMAZING WHAT DANIEL JONES CAN DO WHEN HE HAS TIME TO THROW THE FOOTBALL AND HAS SOME WEAPONS TO THROW TO? NABERS SLIPS THROUGH THAT GAP, AND I TELL YOU, WHAT A JOB OF BEING PATIENT, WAITING FOR THE LINEBACKER 50. YOU CAN SEE HIM COMING DOWN AND HE OPENED UP JUST ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE SQUEEZE BEFORE NABERS GETS HIT. GREAT PLAY. AL: SPEAKING OF, THIS DRIVE AS JONES AVOIDS THE SACK AND THE THROWS INCOMPLETE, OUT OF PRESSURE PUT ON. WONDERING IF MANNERS COULD RECOVER THAT FUMBLE, COULD BEEN A DISASTROUS BEGINNING TO THE SECOND HALF. KIRK: THIS DALLAS DEFENSE BEING TESTED, DEMARCUS LAWRENCE, 90, TRYING TO GET PRESSURE. JUST MRISSES -- MISSES. DANIEL JONES, SIX FOOT 5, 230, PULLING AWAY FROM LAWRENCE. OPENING THINGS UP TO START THE SECOND HALF. SIX THROWS AND TWO RUNS. AL: LAWRENCE TO THE SIDELINE. OVER THE LEFT SIDE, PICKING UP THREE. MAKE IT THIRD DOWN AND GOAL. KIRK: WE KNOW WHO HAS BEEN HIS TARGET. NABERS LAST WEEK HAD A COUPLE OF BIG PLAYS DOWN IN THIS AREA, AND WE HAVE A MAN DOWN. LOOKS LIKE THE COWBOYS. AL: YOU SAW LAWRENCE ALREADY ON LAWRENCE, WALKING IN TO THE LOCKER ROOM. JUST TO REMIND FANS WHERE NABERS IS AND THE BIG SCORES THAT HE HAD LAST WEEK. AL: OFF TO THE LEFT. PASS IS CAUGHT AND TAKING DOWN AT THE FOUR YARD LINE, ROBINSON, SO IT MAKES IT FOURTH DOWN AND GOAL. KIRK: SO THEY USE NABERS AS A DECOY, TRYING TO BE AHEAD OF IT HERE IS NABERS, HE IS GOING TO OCCUPY A COUPLE DEFENDERS. DIGGS, ALSO 13, TRY TO CREATE SPACE TO SEE IF ROBINSON CAN MAKE SOMEONE MISS, BUT 13 ALL OVER THIS FIELD MAKES A GOOD PLAY GETTING HIM OUT OF BOUNDS BEFORE THE END ZONE. AL: HE OF COURSE DOES NOT LIKE THE FIELD GOAL, BUT AS A FAMOUS COACH SAID A LONG TIME AGO, PRETTY SOON YOU ARE SITTING WITH IT. FIELD GOAL IS GOOD FROM 22, SO FOUR FIELD GOALS OFF THE FOOT OF JOSEPH. AL: MIKE HAS IN AROUND A LONG TIME, WON A SUPER BOWL IN 2010. HE AND AARON RODGERS TOGETHER. STARTED AS A TOLLBOOTH OPERATOR ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE. HAS HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS AS A COACH THE LAST THREE YEARS. MIKE HAS GONE 12-5, BUT THE BUGABOO FOR THE COWBOYS IS JANUARY. KIRK: IT'S ALL ABOUT THE POSTSEASON. LAST YEAR, THEY BECAME A TRENDY PICK, NOT JUST AWAY PRESCOTT WAS PLAYING, BUT PULLING AWAY FROM PEOPLE. IQ SAID, YOU GET TO THE POSTSEASON, AND PEOPLE QUICKLY FORGET ABOUT THE REGULAR SEASON. AL: JOSEPH, WHOALEX SMITH ALSO I CATEGORY. TWO GUYS WITH CAREERS BUT NOT A LOT OF SUCCESS BOTH SEASONS. OUTSIDE GOES THE FIRST PASS. THEY'RE GOING TO WHISTLE IT OUT OF BOUNDS. FERGUSON WAS ABLE TO GET BY. SECOND DOWN. KIRK: DAK PRESCOTT HAS HAD A GREAT NIGHT DURING THE FOOTBALL, 15-17 ON THE NIGHT AREA SOME HAVE BEEN QUICK PASSES. HE'S BEEN VERY PATIENT, GETS A NICE BLOCK, WORKS FROM THE RIGHT, COMES BACK TO THE LEFT TO LOOKING FOR HIS GUY, AND INSTEAD, IT IS TAKEN AWAY, ABLE TO EVENTUALLY CHECK THAT DOWN THE SCREEN AND MAKE A BIG PLAY A LOT OF BIG RESULTS. AL: FERGUSON TAKES THIS ONE, AND HE WILL PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN. BURNS CAME IN FROM ONE SIDE AND THIBODEAUX FROM THE OTHER. WHO DO YOU THINK IS THE COWBOYS LEADING RUSHER TONIGHT? DO NOT LOOK. AL: YEAH, 10 YARDS. FOUR CARRIES FROM 8, 51 FOR SIX, ELLIOTT, ONE FOR FIVE. KIRK: DAK IT'S HITS AFTER THAT THROW, FLEXING HIS HAND. AL: HALFWAY MARK OF THE QUARTER. AND A DECENT RUN HERE AS HE TAKES THAT TO THE 50 YARD LINE. KIRK: JONES MAKING ADJUSTMENTS LET'S SEE WHAT THEY MIGHT WANT TO CONTINUE TO DO. GREAT OPENING DRIVE. WE TALKED IN OUR MEETING THIS MORNING, YOU ARE USED TO A PROFILE, HERE IS A GUY HE WAS A JOURNEYMAN, 50 YEAR, A BACKUP, HAD TO WAIT HIS TURN. AL: NICE RUN HERE. YOU THINK OF THE COWBOYS AND THE HISTORY OF THEM, HERSCHEL, WALKER, EMMITT SMITH, AND NOW, WHO? KIRK: AND HE WAS A BACKUP, THIRD GUY, AND A LOT OF TIME JUST ON SPECIAL TEAMS. JUST BY STICKING AROUND, IMPROVING AND GETTING BETTER. ONE THING FOR SURE, HE RUNS HARD, RUNS WITH A CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER AND GETS HIS HANDS ON AL: INTO THE OFFSIDE. AND ELLIOTT MAKES THE CATCH. ELLIOTT WITH NEW ENGLAND LAST YEAR. HE LED THE PATRIOTS AND RECEIVING YARDS. KIRK: GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO HIS DAYS IN OHIO STATE. HE CAN BREAK TACKLES AND HAVE SPEED AT THE SECOND AND THIRD LEVEL, BUT HE DOES HAVE NATURAL, SOFT HANDS. HERE HE IS MOTIONING OUT. AL: SECOND AND FIVE. CEEDEE LAMB COMES OUT OF THE BACK FIELD. HE CATCHES, HE SPENDS AND CANNOT GET THE FIRST DOWN. KIRK: HOW ABOUT THAT AS A CHANGE OF FOR MIKE MCCARTHY, GETTING MOTION OUT, AND YOU KEEP 88 AND THE BACKFIELD, CEEDEE LAMB, JUST TO GIVE THE GIANTS DEFENSE A DIFFERENT LOOK, EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION, MAKE THEM TRY TO KEEP GUESSING WHERE CEEDEE LAMB MIGHT BE. NOW HE'S ON THE SPOT OFF TO THE LEFT. AL: THIRD AND 1. THE FULLBACK IN THE BACKFIELD. AND OUT OF HIS REACH, THE FLAG IS DOWN. AMAZINGLY, THE FIRST OF THE KIRK: THEY MAY GET THAT LEFT TACKLE, THE ROOKIE AGAIN. >> HOLDING, OFTEN. 10 YARD PENALTY. AL: -- KIRK: WHEN YOU DOUBLE INSIDE, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. HE HAS TREMENDOUS LENGTH AT 6' HE HAS TREMENDOUS LENGTH AT 6'7" , BUT GOING UP AGAINST THIBODEAUX, AS AN INSIDE MOVE, THEY GOT HIM AGAIN. HE KEEPS WORKING THE LEVERAGE TO THE OUTSIDE, AND YOU HAVE TO GIVE KATIE CREDIT FOR WORKING OUTSIDE AND THEN USING THAT POWER MOVE TO GO BACK INSIDE TO BEAT HIM, AND THAT IS ANOTHER TIME HE GOT A HOLDING CALL TO GET THAT MOVE. AL: 42 YARD LINE, THIRD DOWN AND 11. AND, YES, THEY ARE IN HIS RANGE. 61 YARDS FROM HERE. BACKFIRES, AND THAT IS AND IN COMES WHICH UNIT? KIRK: THEY ARE GOING TO OPT FOR BRANDON AUBREY. WHO HAS BECOME A TREMENDOUS WEAPON. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. IT IS EXCITING TO SEE IF THE OLD SCHOOL KICKER COME OUT. WITH ALL THESE INJURIES, HE HAS HAD TO STEP UP. YOU HAVE DUKE SHELLEY OUT THERE, HE HELD UP PRETTY WELL ON THE BACKEND. AL: 60 YARDER. "TULSA KING" AND BACK WE COME, POST MALONE WEARING HIS COWBOY GEAR. GOOD BUDDY OF AUBREY. ON THE FIELD BEFORE THE GAME, SIGNING TONS OF AUTOGRAPHS. YOU CAN LOOK AT HIM ON THE BIG BOARD. KIRK: THEY ALSO SAW THE YANKEES DEFEATING THE ORIOLES AND CLINCHING. AL: YEP. CLINCH THE DIVISION TITLE. AS GRAY RUNS IT BACK. OUT TO THE 32 YARD LINE. PENALTY IS DOWN, AND WE WILL GO TO KAYLEE AND A SECOND. LONG TIME SINCE WE'VE HEARD FROM SO IT IS ABOUT TIME. LAWRENCE IS BACK OUT, GETTING TAPED. WE HOPE YOU CAN GET BACK INTO THE GAME. ALL RIGHT, PICK IT UP. KAYLEE: YOU SAW BRANDON AUBREY NAIL THAT 60 YARD THE OLD SCHOOL BUT HE DOES NOT SPEND TIME PRACTICING KICKS FARTHER THAN THAT. HE FEELS CHANGES NEEDED TO GET EXTRA POWER AND HE DOES NOT WANT TO DISRUPT HIS NORMAL KICKING FORM. HE TOLD ME PREGAME THAT HE NORMALLY CAPS WARM UP KICKS AT 58 YARDS AND BY SEEING WHERE THE BALL HITS THE NET, HE KNOWS HOW MUCH DISTANCE HE HAS. HE TELLS ME HE IS GOOD FOR 68 YARDER IN THESE CONDITIONS. AL: I DON'T DOUBT THAT, YOU WONDER HOW FAR HE CAN KICK ONE. JONES AND OUTSIDE. NABERS MAKES THE CATCH. SECOND DOWN FOR MALIK NABERS KIRK: CONTINUING HERE, THE SECOND DRIVE TO START THE SECOND THE OFFENSIVE STAFF, THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE EARLY AND OFTEN, THROWING THIS FOOTBALL AND TRUSTING DANIEL JONES TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS, 20 OF 23 TONIGHT , 222 YARDS. JONES KEEPS. HE IS GOING TO GET WRAPPED UP, AND HE WILL GET TAKEN DOWN TO THE 30 YARD LINE BY MARSHAWN KNEELAND. SO THEY SACK HIM. KIRK: THIS IS HIS OWN READ THAT HE MISREADS, ONE OF THE FEW MISTAKES HE HAS MADE. HE IS READING THIS GUY RIGHT HERE, AND IF HE COLLAPSES ON THE BACK, HE GIVES HIM THAT LOOK AND COMES OUT AT THE QUARTERBACK, SO THEY NEEDED TO STAY ON THAT RIDE A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO GET A GOOD INDICATOR. THAT TIME KNEELAND, THE ROOKIE, GOT THE BEST OF IT THERE. AL: NABERS SHIFTING OVER TO THE RIGHT SIDE. PRESS COVERAGE. JONES THE OTHER WAY. THE TACKLE IS MADE THEREBY JOURDAN LEWIS ON ROBINSON, SO IT IS FOURTH DOWN. THE COWBOY DEFENSE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB ON NABERS. IT IS NOT THAT ONE PASS WHEN THEY LOST HIM, THE 39 YARDS, BUT THE OTHER SIX CATCHES ARE GOOD FOR 40 YARDS. KIRK: THEY ARE MIXING UP COVERAGE, ROLLING TO HIM. THAT TIME THEY LEFT DIGGS ON AN ISLAND BECAUSE THEY TRUST HIM AND THE PLATE ON THE INSIDE, ONE OF THE GREAT LEADERS, JOURDAN LEWIS. NOWHERE TO GO AFTER THE CATCH. AL: GIANTS' FIRST PUNT. THE SCOTTISH BORN JAMIE GILLAN, LEFT-FOOTED KICKER, BACKSPIN. MADE AT THE 18 YARD LINE BY TONIGHT'S JOURNEY, PRESENTED BY CHAIM DAY. A COUPLE OF TOUCHDOWN PASSES, JONES, AS WELL. ONLY THREE MISFIRES AND NABERS HAD THAT 139 YARD CATCH, SEVEN OVERALL, BUT THE DALLAS DEFENSE GOING A GOOD JOB TONIGHT. CEEDEE LAMB SEVEN 98 WITH A FIVE POINT GAME, 2:57 LEFT IN THE THIRD. A HOLD, AND THAT IS ELLIOTT WITH A FLAG AND A PAIR AND THE OFFENSIVE BACKFIELD. KIRK: I THINK WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF PEARS, NOT JUST ONE FLAG. A LOT OF AGREEMENT OUT THERE AL: KIND OF SORT OF. KIRK: MAYBE NOT. >> THERE ARE TWO VALVES ON THE OFFENSE, NUMBER 73. HOLDING, NUMBER 56, 10 YARD PENALTY. AL: TAKE YOUR PICK. KIRK: THAT IS NOT GOOD WHEN YOU HAVE THE CENTER AND THE LEFT CALL ON A HOLD. AL: AND THEN YOU SIGNIFY ONE GUY AND NOW THE OTHER GREG, IT WILL BE ON HIS RAP OTHER GUY GETS AWAY WITH IT. AL: SO NOW FIRST AND 20. THE CROWD IS GETTING IMPATIENT. I DON'T BLAME THEM. TOOK A WHILE TO RESET IT. BACK TO THE NINE. ANTI-IS TAKING DOWN BY BRIAN BURNS -- AND HE IS TAKING DOWN BY BRIAN BURNS. HE'S HAD A QUIET NIGHT BUT A GOOD BEGINNING TO HIS CAREER IN CAROLINA. THE GIANTS NEEDED A GOOD ENERGIZER, AND THEY WENT AFTER HIM AND GOT HIM. KIRK: HOW ABOUT THE LEFT TACKLE, GETTING THIBODEAUX AND NOW BURNS. HE KEPT HIS OUTSIDE ARM AND SHOULDER FREE, ABLE TO KEEP CONTAINED IN CASE CEEDEE LAMB, WHO HAS BEEN IN THE BACKFIELD THREE TIMES, MIGHT BOUNDS THAT. BACK TO PERFECT POSITION. AL: ON SECOND AND 20. TRYING TO PICK UP A FEW. BURIALS HIS WAY PAST, TACKLED BY MICAH MCFADDEN. THIRD DOWN AND A DOZEN. KIRK: JAKE FERGUSON CHECKING BACK INTO THE GAME ON THIS THIRD A LOT OF TIMES THIRD DOWN FOR DAK PRESCOTT, IF YOU CANNOT FIND CEEDEE LAMB, FERGUSON'S HIS SECURITY BLANKET. THEY HAVEN' THEY HAVEN'T LINED UP ON THE RIGHT SIDE -- THEY HAVE HIM LINED UP ON THE RIGHT SIDE. AL: HE IS NOW OUTSIDE. AND THAT GOES THE OTHER WAY. AND THEY ARE SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN, SO THE COWBOYS' FIRST PUNT IS IN THEIR OWN TERRITORY. KIRK: SHANE BOWEN GOT A LOT OF RECOGNITION AGAINST DESHAUN WATSON FOR DOWNING UP A LOT OF BLITZES. ON THAT THIRD DOWN, HE WALKED SOME PEOPLE UP. DAK GOT THEY WERE BRINGING THE HOUSE ON THIRD DOWN, AT THE SNAP OF A BALL, THEY SIT BACK IN THE ZONE, THE BALL COMES OUT QUICK AND THEY ARE ABLE TO RALLY THE FOOTBALL PRETTY EASILY. AL: BRYAN ANGER HAS A TWO PUNCH ONE FOR 60, AND ONE FOR 50. TO THE 26 YARD LINE. HAS SOME ROOM. AND THE COWBOYS, FINALLY, JUST SHY OF LEFT FIELD. GOOD RUN BACK. GREAT STARS, GREAT GAMES. TONIGHT FOR AN EARLY-SEASON GAME, VERY MEANINGFUL. THE COWBOYS HAVE BEEN REELING. FIRST OF, 4-5 OF THE NEXT GAMES ARE ON THE ROAD. THE GIANTS JUST TRYING TO GET BACK TO .500. TRYING TO KEEP THEIR FOOT ON THE GAS PEDAL. KIRK: YOU GO 1-3 EVEN THOUGH IT'S EARLY IN THE YEAR. IT'S A CYNICAL BUNCH. AL: YOU THINK? FROM THE 48 YARD LINE. HE WILL BREAK THE TACKLE AND GET TAKEN DOWN FOR GAME SIX. QUICKLY TO KAYLEE. KAYLEE: DEMARCUS LAWRENCE CAME BACK TO THE SIDELINE TRAINING TABLE TO GET THE ARCH OF HIS RIGHT FOOT TAPED. HE'S GOT HIS HELMET IN HIS HANDS BUT HE'S NOT BACK OUT ON THE FIELD YET. AL: WE SEE HIM RIGHT THERE. HUGE PART OBVIOUSLY OF THAT DALLASACROSS THE RIVER IN MANHAT I SAID WE WERE IN THE BAG -- BIG APPLE BEFORE. WE ARE IN EAST RUTHERFORD. THIS IS LIKE THE BIG APPLE. BACK TO BACK WEEKS. AL: YOU ARE RIGHT. SECOND DOWN AND 2 TO GET TO THE GETS AROUND THE CORNER. 85. HAND HURTS. >> HOLDING. OFFENSE NUMBER 85. REPLAY SECOND DOWN. >> ONLY THE FOURTH EXCEPTED PENALTY AGAINST THE GIANTS. SEEMS ABOUT 40. 11 EXCEPTED THE COWBOYS TONIGHT. KIRK: ANYTIME YOU GET TO THE CORNER LIKE THAT, YOU WONDER WHO MADE THE BLOCK. MAN HURTS LOCKS HIM UP. EASY CALL FOR THE OFFICIAL. BAD TIMING FOR THE GIANTS. THEY ARE IN PLUS TERRITORY. THEY HAVE A LITTLE MOMENTUM. KNIFE -- NICE MOVE BY NOW THEY GET BEHIND THE STICKS. AL: SECOND AND 12. BACK ON THEIR HALF OF THE FIELD. THE SWING IS OVER. THE LEFT DIGS ON HIM. JONES GOING DEEP. DOES HE MAKE THE GRADE? HE DOES NOT. HAD TO SLOW DOWN AND COULD NOT HOLD IT IN. KIRK: THE BALL IS UNDERTHROWN. IT'S A BIT OF A STORYLINE IN THE PENN STATE IS IN RIGHT NOW FOR ANDREW BOOTH. HE GETS BEAT OFF THE LINE. THE BALL IS UNDERTHROWN WHICH ENDS UP BRINGING SLATE AND BACK. THINK ABOUT IT. CARSON ROOKIE OPPOSITE OF DIGS IS NOT PLAYING TONIGHT. AL: 11 PERSONNEL. ONE BACK A, ONE TIGHT END. TIMEOUT HERE. BEFORE A THIRDKIRK: ZACH PRESCOT STAY LOOSE. OVER 11 MINUTE ADVANTAGE. GOOD JOB OF KEEPING HIM COMPANY YOU'VE GOT A YOUNG DOESN'T HAVE A TON OF EXPERIENCE. YOU ARE JUST TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO CREATE A MATCHUP WITH YOUR BEST GUY AGAINST HIM. DIGS DOING A GOOD JOB OF MOVING 27. THERE IT IS. AL: TO THE RIGHT. ON THIRD AND 11. JONES LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN THE COMING THIS WAY. CAUGHT. BREAKING THE TACKLE IS ROBINSON. ROBINSON NOW HAS CAUGHT 10 PASSES FOR SIX TO NINE YARDS. KIRK: GABLE CONSERVATIVE TONIGHT ON THESE DECISIONS. THESE EITHER OR. THE ANALYTICS SAY TO GO FOR IT. HE'S BEEN CONSERVATIVE. HE SENSES THIS IS THE TIME. GET AGGRESSIVE. AL: FOURTH DOWN AND 3. AUBREY WOULD BE IN RANGE. KIRK: DIGS FOLLOWING HIS NEIGHBORS. JONES THROWS. IT'S CAUGHT. COMING INSIDE WITH NEIGHBORS. SLOWLY GETTING UP TO HIS FEET. KIRK: WHAT A JOB OF GETTING THE BALL OUT IN A HURRY. INSIDE LEVERAGE FROM DIGS. TIMING ONCE AGAIN PERFECT. HE'S NOW 24-28 TONIGHT. THERE'S PARSONS CLOSE. THE EFFICIENCY OF JONES HAS BEEN SUFFER -- SUPER. AL: SOME ON THE SIDELINE. PLAY FAKE. OVER THE MIDDLE. NEIGHBORS AGAIN. THE FLAG IS THROWN THOUGH. 21 YARD LINE. THE BAD PLAY IS DOWN AT THE 25 KIRK: I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE ON DALLAS. REFEREE: DEFENSE, NUMBER 27. AL: YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT HIM. KIRK: THEY END UP NEIGHBORS OVER THERE, TRYING TO MAKE THIS YOUNG MAN HAVE TO ADJUST. THERE 27. GIVES HIM A CHECK THERE. STILL ABLE TO GET THE BALL TO STARTING TO COME ALIVE A BIT IN AL: NEIGHBORS AND ROBINSON WITH 10 CATCHES EACH. THIS TIME NEIGHBORS WILL GO NOWHERE. THE TACKLE THERE. I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT HE GOT UP FROM NOT HIT. SECOND-MOST ARE FOUR GAMES. CLOSING IN ON 400 YARDS. GAME ON THE LINE. DIALING HIM UP AS MUCH AS HE CAN. AL: THE TOSS BACK TO SINGLETARY. HE WILL CUT IT BACK. JONES COMES INTO LOOK FOR THE BLOCK. PUTS THE GUY DOWN. THIRD DOWN AND 14. KIRK: LOOKS LIKE HE'S DOWN. AL: SO THEY WORK ON THEIR NUMBER ONE DEFENSIVE BACK. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. KIRK: THE BALL CAME ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE LEFT. DIGGS GETTING INVOLVED TO C IT UP. GOOD PLAY BY MILLIE COKER. LEAH FALLON INVOLVED OBVIOUSLY. NOT SURE ABOUT THE DECISION BY SINKING TERRY -- SINGLE TERRY. I UNDERSTAND TRYING TO KEEP A PLAYER LIVE. -- PLAY ALIVE. BUT TO BOUNCE IT ALL THE WAY TOUGH THING TO DO AGAINST T SPEED OF THIS DEFENSE. AL: WHO IS COMING INTO REPLACE DIGGS? THERE IS HIS SON. HAS TO COME OUT FOR AT LEAST ONE GOING TO BE THIRD. THEY WILL TAKE HIM A BACK INTO THE LOCKER ROOM IN FACT. IT WILL BE A LOT MORE THAN ONE NOT EVEN THE BLUE TENT. NOW THE PRESSURE. KIRK: THE BACKUP, 24 COMES INTO 6-4. DIFFERENT STYLE ON THE EDGE. AL: WHO DOES JONES WANT TO PICK ON HERE? NEIGHBORS TO THE OUTSIDE. RIGHT SIDE AND INCOMPLETE. A LITTLE UNDERTHROWN AT THE 10 DARIUS SLAYTON IS THERE. ANOTHER UNDERTHROWN BALL. IN COMES JOSEPH. KIRK: PARSONS CARL LAWSON.

AL: WORKING ON MARTIN ON THE THEY PICK UP A FIRST DOWN HERE ON A SECOND AND SHORT. HIS DAD WILL TAKE THE BALL TO THE 40 YARD LINE. SOMETHING IN HIS EYES. MARTIN, WHAT AN AMAZING CAREER THIS GUY HAS HAD. 11 YEARS. VICTIM OUT OF NOTRE DAME IN THE FIRST ROUND. MORE PRO BALLS, MORE ALL-PRO SELECTIONS. KIRK: NO MARTIN IS OUT. AL: PRESCOTT THROWS. CONTESTED AND INCOMPLETE. TAKING CARE OF BRANDIN COOKS. KIRK: GOOD TO SEE MARTIN BACK OUT ON THE FIELD. I DON'T KNOW IF IS VISION. -- HIS EYE HAS MUCH VISION. DREW PHILLIPS DOWN TONIGHT. A DORI JACKSON. HE'S BUILDING UP PRETTY GOOD. GREAT LENGTHS TO GET AROUND COOKS AND MAKE THE PLAY. AL: CAUGHT ONLY ONE FOR 16 YARDS EARLY IN THE GAME. ON SECOND AND 10. PRESCOTT FIRES TO THE SIDELINE. THAT'S HOLDING. THAT'S THE COWBOYS ANSWER TO THE GIANTS NUMBER ONE JALEN TOLBERT MAKING THE CATCH. BIG PLAY. 15 YARDS. FIRST DOWN AT THE 25 YARD LINE. KIRK: ALL GREAT ATHLETE. BASEBALL, BASKETBALL, FOOTBALL. GREAT JOB OF PUTTING THE BALL OUT EARLY SO WE CAN WORK BACK TO BACK TO BACK TIMES, THEY RUN THE SAME ROUTE. THIS TIME TOLD BERT COMES DOWN WITH IT. AL: BOUNCING IS WEIGHED. TO THE 21 YARD LINE. EIGHT MINUTES TO GO IN REGULATION. KIRK: THIS IS A HUGE DRIVE FOR BOTH OF THESE TEAMS. THEY CAN SENSE THAT. UNDER EIGHT MINUTES TO GO. AN INJURED PLAYER, THIS TIME THE AL: WE'VE GOT DJ DAVIDSON. MAKES THE SHORT TRACK OVER TO THE GIANTS SIDELINE. KIRK: IF YOU ARE DALLAS, -- IF YOU ARE NEW YORK, YOU HOLD THEM TO A FIELD GOAL, YOU FEEL GOOD. YOU GIVE UP A TOUCHDOWN AND AN EXTRA POINT P GOOD GOES TO A TWO POSSESSION GAME. YOU GET DOWN TO THAT SEVEN MINUTE MARK. AL: I'M NOT SURE I FEEL THAT GOOD THE WAY THE GIANT OFFENSE IS GOING TONIGHT, YOU KNOW? YOU DON'T WANT TO GET DOWN BY MORE THAN A FIELD GOAL. HALFWAY THROUGH THE CORRIDOR COWBOYS. KIRK: YOU GIVE UP SOME YARDS. THAT'S EXPECTED AGAINST THIS I PRESCOTT OFFENSE. THAT'S WHERE YOU RELY ON BRIAN BRONX. WE JUST SHOWED YOU SOME HIGHLIGHTS TONIGHT. BURNS LINES UP ACROSS ON THE PRESCOTT, LOOK OUT. HE THROWS AND INCOMPLETE. THIBODEAU COMING AROUND THE CORNER TO BUSTED KIRK: I DON'T KNOW IF HE PHYSICALLY GOT TO THAT. YOU CAN SEE HIM FEEL THE PRESSURE OFF TO HIS RIGHT. I THINK IT AFFECTS HIS ACCURACY. HE JUST FALLS OFF THE THROW TO HIS LEFT. THAT IS WHAT BROUGHT THE BALL THIBODEAU HAVING AN IMPACT GIANTS FANS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR HIM TO BE THAT GUY TO GET TONIGHT HE HAS BEEN. AL: AUBREY NOW. 40 YARDS. HEGIANTS STADIUM. EAST RUTHERFORD, NEW JERSEY. TEMPERATURE RIGHT NOW, ROOM 72 DEGREES. KIRK: GREAT TO SEE DIGS -- DIGGS BACK FROM THE HE HAD CRAMPING. AL: PARSONS HAS BEEN IN AND OUT SINCE HE GOT IT IS -- GOT HIS ATTENTION. AUBREY PUT THE GIANTS AT THE 30. KIRK: OUR NEXGEN STATS POWERED BY AWS. PARSONS AGAINST ANDREW THOMAS. 14 TIMES THEY'VE GONE UP AGAINST EACH OTHER. LOOK AT WHAT THE BIG FELLA DONE. JUST ONE PRESSURE OFF THE LEFT SIDE, THE BLIND SIDE OF DANIEL REALLY GOOD JOB EVEN WHEN HE'S BEEN ISOLATED. ABLE TO HOLD ON AGAINST THE PASS RUSH. THAT'S WHY PARSONS HAS MOVED MOVED TO THE OTHER SIDE. HE'S BACK IN THE LINEUP. AL: THE FULL COMPLEMENT IN RIGHT DIGGS IS TOP OF THE SCREEN. DAVIS CAME TO THE BOTTOM. JONES ROLLING AND LOOKING AND THROWING. HE THREW IT AWAY. KIRK: THE DEFENSE FROM THE GIANTS DID THEIR JOB. UNDER SEVENS TO GO -- SEVEN MINUTES TO GO. DANIEL JONES GETS A TON OF CRITICISM IN THIS TOWN. HE'S DEALT WITH A HARD KNOCK STUFF. A PROVE IT TYPE OF YEAR FOR NOW HE'S GOT A CHANCE TO POTENTIALLY LEAD THE OFFENSE. MAYBE A GAME-WINNING SCORE AGAINST THEIR BIG RIVAL HERE IN PRIME TIME. AL: DALLAS HAS 113-14 MEETINGS BETWEEN THESE TEAMS INCLUDING SIX IN A ROW. JONES THROWS AND IS CAUGHT AT THE 39 YARD LINE. YOU ARE RIGHT. NOBODY HAS BEEN IN THE CROSSHAIRS MORE THAN JONES. NUMBER ONE PICK. SIXTH YEAR. IT'S QUITE THE SAGA. WE TALKED ABOUT IT THE OTHER DAY. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY? WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO THE NEXT GIANTS QUARTERBACK? MAKE IT ALL ABOUT FOOTBALL. FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING OUT -- ELSE. HERE'S THE GENERAL MANAGER. THINK ONLY ABOUT FOOTBALL. THAT'S HARD TO DO IN THIS TOWN. HE? AL: THIRD DOWN AND 4. PRESSURE COMING. PASS IS CAUGHT. DOES HE PICK IT UP? ROBINSON IS TACKLED THERE TO GET THAT MAKES IT FOURTH DOWN. LOOKS AT THE SHEET. ABOUT A HALF A YARD TO GO. KIRK: AS A CORNERBACK, YOU WOULD LOVE TO SEE ROBINSON RUN IN ANOTHER YARD OR TWO FURTHER SO WHEN YOU GET HIT, YOU ARE BEYOND THE STICKS. AL: HE PUTS HIS HEAD DOWN. THE NAKED EYE LOOKS TO HAVE IT. AND HE WILL. KIRK: JUST ENOUGH OF A GREAT OVERHEAD VIEW OF THIS. SOME PENETRATION THERE INITIALLY TO GET DALLAS HAD SOME BIG BODIES IN THEIR BUT HE'S ABLE TO BOUNCE IT AWAY. WILSON TRYING TO GET IN THERE. GOOD SURGE. AL: INSIDE OF FIVE MINUTES. JONES UNDER PRESSURE. TO THE OUTSIDE NEIGHBORS. FORWARD PROGRESS IS STOPPED BY JORDAN KIRK: 12 CATCHES NOW FOR YOU HAVE TO THINK WITH WHAT HE'S DONE HERE EARLY IN HIS CAREER, THIS IS GO TIME FOR HIM. WE'VE SEEN HIM GET MORE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SECOND GABLE WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT, WHERE CAN I GET HIM MATCHED UP? GOT TO MAKE THEM GO TO SOMEBODY IN THE BACKFIELD. PARSONS TAKES TRACY DOWN. HE TAKES THE HANDOFF. KIRK: WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THAT MATCH UP WITH IAN ANDREW THOMAS. GOOD JOB. LOOK AT THIS MOVE OUTSIDE AND BACK INSIDE. SET HIM UP AND GET INSIDE OF HIM. AGAINST A REALLY GOOD LEFT SUPERIOR PLAY RIGHT THERE BY MICAH PARSONS IN CRUNCH TIME. LATERAL QUICKNESS SO ELITES. AL: EVERY THIRD DOWN IN CRUNCH TIME IS VITAL. HERE'S ANOTHER ONE. KIRK: FOLLOWING ONE EVERYWHERE. AL: JONES OVER THE MIDDLE. THAT'S INCOMPLETE. ROBINSON LOOKING FOR A FLAG. INJURED COWBOY BACK AT THE 35 KIRK: THE BALL GOT IN THEIR. ROBINSON, ANY TIME YOU GET BOTH HANDS ON A FOOTBALL, CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO CATCH THAT FOR A PARSONS, WE TALKED ABOUT HIM MOVING FROM THE OUTSIDE. THIS TIME RIGHT OVER TOP OF THE AL: IT HUNG UP WITH GREG VAN ROTEN. AND HE' BLUE 10. MARCUS LAWRENCE IS OUT. TWO KEY GUYS. MARSHAWN KNEELAND IS IN. CHAUNCEY GOLSTON IS IN. THE GIANTS RIGHT NOW HAVE A FOURTH AND 6 AT THE 45. THEY COULD LAND A 3-3. HAVE TO GET TO THE COWBOY 49 THE SURVEYS. CHASED AWAY. CHASED FROM BEHIND. IT DOES NOT. THE OFFICIALS NOW WITH EACH OTHER. THREE ARE SAYING NO. KIRK: HE NEVER HAD POSSESSION OF THE FOOTBALL. GOOD JOB WITH THE OFFICIALS COMING TOGETHER. THE OFFICIAL BEHIND NEIG THOUGHT HE MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HOLD ON TO THE BALL FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE. YOU CAN SEE THAT THE BALL DOES COME OUT. CLEARLY IT IS INCOMPLETE. THEY TURN THE BALL OVER AND THEY ARE FORCED TO HAVE TO USE THE THEY HAD TO SPEND ONE IN THE THIRD QUARTER WHEN JONES HAD A KIRK: HOW ABOUT THE EFFORT BY NEIGHBORS? IF HE HOLDS ONTO THE BALL, HIS FEET ARE DOWN. AL: COMING INTO THE GAME, WE HIGHLIGHTED THE SPECTACULAR DEBUT. WHEN OBJ BROKEN NUMBER OF YEARS AGO AND MADE GREAT CATCH AFTER GREAT CATCH. HE'S ABLE TO GET UP. MEANWHILE, PARSONS COMES OUT OF THE TENT BUT ONTO THE CART. THE COWBOYS AT LEAST HAVE THE MANY -- MINI BYE WEEK. IT WILL TAKE NEIGHBORS TO THE BLUE TENT AS WELL. SO THE COWBOYS DON'T HAVE TO PLAY ANOTHER GAME UNTIL THEY GO TO PITTSBURGH AND 10 DAYS -- IN PERSON GOES BACK TO THE LOCKER THE GIANTS WITH THEIR NEXT GAME IN SEATTLE. NO BARGAIN. NOW THE COWBOYS CAN PLAY A LITTLE CLOCK BALL HERE. TWO TIMEOUTS FOR THE GIANTS PLUS A TWO-MINUTE WARNING. START ON THE GROUND. NOT QUITE THE COMPLETE OLD ZEKE. KIRK: IT HELPS WHEN YOU HAVE AN OFFENSIVE LINE THAT'S OPENING UP A WHOLE AND LETTING HIM GET DOWNHILL. SECOND LEVEL DEFENSE. JUST WONDER FOR THE GIANTS, DOWN FIVE HERE. OBVIOUSLY DALLAS WILL WORK CLOCK. GABLE HOPING TO BE ABLE TO HOLD THEM TO A FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT. AL: THAT WOULD MAKE IT AN EIGHT POINT GAME. THEY HAVE ONE TIMEOUT. TOOK THEIR SECOND RIGHT THERE. DIGGS RECOVERING ON THE GOING BACK AND FORTH. ELLIOTT PUTS HIS SHOULDER DOWN. COMES UP A LITTLE BIT SHORT. THE GIANTS HAVE TO TAKE THEIR FINAL TIMEOUT. REFEREE: 30 SECONDS. AL: THIS GAME HAS NOT BEEN A BARNBURNER OR A THE COWBOYS HAVE TO DO SO MUCH JUST GETTING SHREDDED THE LAST TWO WEEKS BY NEW ORLEANS. MISSING LAWRENCE A LOT. PARSONS HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF HAVE TO BE PROUD O DONE TONIGHT. KIRK: THEY'VE DONE A HECK OF A JOB WITH THE MENTALITY OF THE IF I' IF I'M A COWBOYS FAN, THEY ARE EXCITED TO SEE THIS EFFORT. AL: THIRD-ONE. I YARD AND A HALF. THAT'S ENOUGH. LIPKE PICKS UP THE FIRST OUT. THE ONLY TIME THE CLOCK WILL STOP NOW IS AT THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING. THEY TAKE NEIGHBORS BACK TO THE 10 DAYS UNTIL THEY GO TO SEATTLE FOR THE NEXT ONE. KIRK: PHYSICAL GAME TONIGHT. SLOPPY GAME. I DON'T CARE. IF YOU ARE A DALLAS COWBOYS FAN, SIT THERE STARING. POTENTIALLY DROPPING TO 1-3. TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF HERE WITH A WIN TO GET SITTING THERE AT REFEREE: -- THAT'S OK. AL: THERE'S THE UPCOMING SCHEDULE. ELLIOTT IS TAKEN DOWN THE MCFADDEN MAKES THE TACKLE. FOR DANIEL JONES TONIGHT, NUMBERS WERE GOOD. 29-37. BUT THEY CAN' BUT THEY CAN'T FINISH THE DRIVE. FIVE FIELD GOALS. THAT WILL DO IT. KIRK: JONES PLAYED WELL. PLAYED HAPPY RIDE HOME. IF THEY HOLD ON HERE, THEY WILL GO TO [NO AUDIO] -- 2-0 AWAY. THAT GUY HAS TO BE REALLY HAPPY THERE HE IS. MIKE SIMMER. HE COMES IN. TAKES OVER. NUMBER FIVE DEFENSE LAST YEAR. TONIGHT, TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. GIVING UP 464 INTO GAMES. -- IN TWO GAMES. THE GIANTS ARE AVERAGING 1.1 YARD PER RUSH. KIRK: THEY BIT ABOUT IT -- DI BETTER JOB ON THE DEFENSIVE TONIGHT, OVER SHOWN. NUMBER 13. I THINK THEY LINEBACKER NEXT TO HIM RIGHT HE PLAYED REALLY WELL. HE WAS ALL OVER THE FIELD. AL: TO THE 33 GOES DOWN. SO THEY WILL TAKE IT ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE. AUBREY STARTS OUT ONTO THE SO AS IT LOOKS RIGHT NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERY HAPPY THAT THERE WILL BE A FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT. OTHERS NOT SO HAPPY. YOU DO KNOW WHAT I MEAN. SO THIS WILL BE A 51 YARD OF ALL THINGS, NO GOOD. IT'S HIS FIRST EVER MISS FROM 50 PLUS. SO THE PATIENT IS BREATHING. JUST BARELY THOUGH. KIRK: AND NOT JUST A MISS. LOOK FOR THE FIELD POSITION. THIS IS THE RISK THAT YOU TAKE WHEN YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE IN A KICKER THAT CAN MAKE THESE LONG KICKS. THE BALL WILL BE AT THE 41-YARD LINE FOR DANIEL JONES WHO IS OUT OF TIMEOUTS, AND EXPERIENCED GUY. HAS TO WORK THE SIDELINES AND BE SMART HERE. LET'S SEE IF THEY CAN GET INTO DEEP ENOUGH SHOT. AL: DON'T FORGET CRAZIER THINGS HAVE HAPPENED. NO TIMEOUTS. LOOKING FOR A JUMP. GET DOWN THE SIDELINE. BROKEN INTENDED FOR ROBINSON. KIRK: MALIKA GOES FOR THE INTERCEPTION. THE BALL GOES OVER HIS HEAD. ROBINSON GETS BEHIND HIM. I THINK HE LOST A FOOTBALL BUT WHAT A RISK THAT HOOKER TAKES TRYING TO LOCATE THE BALL, GO UP. IT GOES RIGHT UP OVE AL: NO DOUBT. ROBINSON, 5'8". KIRK: ALMOST A METLIFE MIRACLE AL: NEIGHBORS HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH A CONCUSSION. DOWN TO 22 SECONDS. JONES, PRESSURE. DOWN THE SIDELINE. THAT'S THROWN OUT OF BOUNDS. THIRD DOWN AND 10. YOU HAVE SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN AUBREY TO KICK ONE. CONSIDERING THE CIRCUMSTANCE, YOU PUT HIM AT THE 10 YARD LINE. THEN YOU TELL HIM 90 YARDS INSTEAD OF 59. A HAIL WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS. KIRK: 15 SECONDS LEFT. YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH A WAY TO BE ABLE TO GET THE BALL, NOT JUST FIRST DOWN BUT TO THE HE'S OFF TO THE RIGHT. AL: JONES LAUNCHING IT. DEEP DOWNFIELD. IT'S TAKEN AWAY. DOUBLE RECEIVER. MIKE SIMMER CAN BREATHE AN OFFICIAL SIGH OF RELIEF. WITH FIVE HAVE CEMENTED THE WIN. KIRK: THINK ABOUT THAT. 29 YEARS OF COACHING IN THE NFL. MIKE MCCARTHY BRINGS HIM INTO TAKE OVER THE DEFENSE. GREAT YEAR LAST YEAR. THEY ANSWERED THE CALL TONIGHT. NOT ONLY AGAINST THE RUN. BUT THROUGH THE INJURIES, IN A SHORT WEEK, PLAYED WITH SOME NEWFOUND CONFIDENCE. I'M SURE THEY WILL USE IT AS A SPRINGBOARD INTO THE COMING WEEKS THAT THEY HAVE WITH THE STEELERS, THE LIONS, AND 49ERS. AL: FIFTH-YEAR GUY OUT OF PENN STATE BOUNCED AROUND, PICKED UP AS A FREE AGENT. ONE KNEEL DOWN WILL TAKE US. TO THE FINISH LINE. KIRK: HERE WE GO. AL: THERE WE GO AND HERE WE GO. THE DALLAS COWBOYS GET TO 2-2. DAC PRESCOTT PICKS UP A VICTORY HE'S JUST KILLED THE GIANTS. LAST 13 IN A ROW AGAINST THE THE COWBOYS WINNING BY A SCORE OF 20-15 AT THE MEADOWLANDS.
