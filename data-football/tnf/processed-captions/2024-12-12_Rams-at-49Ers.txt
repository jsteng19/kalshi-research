INDEED. THERE ARE THE STANDINGS RIGHT NOW. BUNCHED UP. YOU SEE SEAN McVAY AND KYLE SHANAHAN. SEAHAWKS WITH A ONE GAME LEAD OVER THE RAMS. CARDINALS HAVE LOST THREE STRAIGHT. THE NINERS COME IN 6-7. SO, KAYLEE IN RAIN GEAR TONIGHT BECAUSE IT'S OFF AND ON. THE SHOWERS ARE COMING AND GOING AND FIGURES TO BE THAT WAY FOR A FEW HOURS. RAMS WON THE TOSS AND THEY GE DEFER. THE 49ers WILL START FROM THE 30 YARD LINE. BROCK PURDY IS COMING OUT. HE MISSED A GAME A COUPLE OF WEEKS WITH A SORE SHOULDER IN GREEN BAY. THEY WERE ON THE ROAD GREEN BAY AND BUFFALO AND GOT SLAUGHTERED IN THOSE TWO GAMES AND WON AGAINST CHICAGO LAST WEEK. THE MAN WAS DRAFTED AS WE SAID LAST IN 2022. HE TOOK OVER THE STARTING JOB LATE IN THAT SEASON. HE GOT THEM TO THE SUPER BOWL LAST YEAR. AND THIS YEAR IS TRYING TO GET THEM BACK INTO THE PLAYOFFS, AT WORST. GUERENDO STARTS AT RUNNING BACK. OUT OF THE GUN, ON FIRST DOWN FROM THE 30 YARD LINE. PLAY FAKE. PASS IS INCOMPLETE. DEEBO SAMUEL HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT NOT GETTING THE BALL ENOUGH. SO THEY GO RIGHT TO HIM. >> Kirk: VERY FIRST PLAY THEY TRY TO GET THE BALL TO THEIR GUY DEEBO SAMUEL. TIGHT COVERAGE THERE BY WITHERSPOON WHO IS IN FOR DURANT WHO IS OUT TONIGHT. ALL OF THESE GUYS ARE OUT INCLUDING McCAFFREY AND AIYUK. HE IS COMING OFF PROBABLY HIS BEST GAME OF THE YEAR LAST WEEK. >> Al: GUERENDO AROUND THE LEFT SIDE AND GOING NOWHERE AND TAKEN DOWN ABOUT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE BY CHRISTIAN ROZEBOOM. THIRD DOWN AND NINE ON THE OPENING DRIVE OF THE GAME FOR THE 49ers. >> Kirk: YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THIS YEAR ABOUT THE RAMS DEFENSE LOOKING FOR AN IDENTITY AND MOVING PAST THE AARON DONALD ERA AND DONE A HECK OF A JOB WITH LES SNEAD, THEIR GENERAL MANAGER, BRINGING IN A LOT OF TALENT. BRANDON FISKE OUT OF FLORIDA STATE AND JARED VERSE, BOTH ROOKIES HAVE HAD A BIG IMPACT AND LEADER COBIE TURNER. >> Al: BURR-OF- >> Al: BURRIRURDEN >> Al: BURRIRU PURDY WENT TOO DE THE PENALTY IS AGAINST SAN FRANCISCO. >> Referee: THE PENALTY IS DECLINED. IT IS FOURTH DOWN. >> Al: THIRD TIME WE HAVE HAD CLAY MARTIN ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND WE UNDERSTAND WE GET HIM NEXT WEEK WITH DENVER AGAINST THE CHARGERS. >> Kirk: A FRUSTRATING WAY TO START. THREE-AND-OUT FOR KYLE SHANAHAN'S OFFENSE AND GREAT SHATTER FOR START FOR CHRIS SUE LA, THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR FOR THE RAMS. GET THE BALL TO STAFFORD RIGHT AWAY AFTER THREE-AND-OUT. >> Al: PAT O'DONNELL SENDS IT DOWN TOWARD XAVIER SMITH. FAIRLY SHORT KICK. FAIR CATCH CALLED FOR AT THE 29 AND THAT IS WHERE MATTHEW STAFFORD WILL SET UP SHOP. MATTHEW STAFFORD HAS REALLY COME ON, LIKE THE TEAM, ITSELF. WHEN HE GOT HOT, THE TEAM GOT HOT. 19 TOUCHDOWNS AND SEVEN PICKS AND FOUR STRAIGHT GAMES WITHOUT AN INTERCEPTION. >> Kirk: YEAH. RIGHT NOW PLAYING AS WELL AS ANYBODY. YOU'RE RIGHT. IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE OFFENSIVE LINE GETTING HEALTHY AND THEY CAN RUN THE FOOTBALL DOWNHILLARY NOW AND BE PHYSICAL AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. KYREN WILLIAMS, 23, THE KEY ON TO SET THIS OFFENSE UP. >> Al: HE IS THE RUNNING BACK. COOPER KUPP IS IN MOTION AND IN MOTION ABOUT EVERY PLAY. FOUR-YARD GAIN FOR WILLIAMS WHO IS A STUD RUNNING BACK. IT'S DRE GREENLAW WHO HAS NOT PLAYED SINCE HE TORE HIS ACHILLES AND TRYING TO RUN OUT ON THE FIELD IN A BIZARRE INCIDENT AT THE SUPER BOWL. HE RAN OUT ON THE FIELD AND WENT DOWN. HE HAS BEEN OUT SINCE THEN. >> Kirk: YOU CAN SEE ON THE VERY FIRST PLAY, IF YOU'RE A NINERS FAN, THAT IS WHAT THIS DEFENSE HAS MISSED, INCLUDING FRED WARNER IN THE MIDDLE WHO GETS A LOT OF ATTENTION. HE'S GOT HIS SIDE-KICK BACK TONIGHT AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL HELP THIS DEFENSE OUT. >> Al: SECOND AND FOUR. WILLIAMS STARTS TO STUMBLE. HE IS TAKEN DOWN TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. YOU SAW THE FLAG COMING IN. LEONARD FLOYD, HE PLAYED WITH THE RAMS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. HE IS IN TO THE STOP. CLAY MARTIN TO MAKE HIS SECOND CALL. IT'S AGAINST THE RAMS. >> Referee: HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER 77. TEN-YARD PENALTY. REPLAY SECOND DOWN. >> Al: JACKSON, THE LEFT TACKLE. >> Kirk: YOU THINK OF LEONARD FLOYD, LIAR FLOYD, LIKE A LOT OF GUYS YOU THINK OF THEM AS GREAT PASS RUSHERS. NICK SORENSEN SAID HE BLOWS UP AWAY HOW PHYSICAL HE IS AGAINST THE RUN. BIG TIME PREP GUY AND GOING UP HIS FORMER TEAM HE WON A SUPER BOWL WITH, YOU KNOW HE IS READY TO GO. >> Al: SECOND AND 14 AFTER THE PENALTY. RUSH IS ON. HE GETS IT AWAY. IT'S INCOMPLETE. COOPER KUPP IS WELL COVERED ON THE PLAY. EVIDENCE COVERED BY DEOMMODORE LENOIR. THIRD DOWN AND 14 FOR THE RAMS. >> Kirk: PRETTY GOOD JOB OF PICKING UP ANY KIND OF MOVEMENT TO GIVE STAFFORD ENOUGH TIME. AS YOU SAID, AL, THERE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE FREE SNAP MOMENT TO GET A TIP ON THE COVERAGE. STAFFORD WORKS FROM THE LEFT TO THE NIGHT AND LENOIR IN TIGHT COVERAGE ANTICIPATING THAT BALL COMING TO THE BACK SIDE THERE TO KUPP. GOOD COVERAGE. >> Al: SEAN McVAY IN HIS EIGHTH SEASON AS THE HEAD COACH. ALSO THE PLAY CALLER. HERE IS BOSA. HE IS TRYING TO DRAW A BEAD ON STAFFORD ON THIRD AND 14. BLOCKING IS GOOD. AGAIN, INTENDED FOR KUPP. LENOIR, AGAIN, COVERING ON THE PLAY. SO FOURTH DOWN. >> Kirk: BOY, LENOIR WITH ANOTHER GREAT PLAY AND JUST KIND OF FEELING THESE ENDS BREAKING ROUTES. HE IS SITTING BACK WITH A PASS RUSH THAT THEY HAVE. HE IS ABLE TO JUST KIND OF SIT BACK AND READ THE EYES OF STAFFORD. HE KNOWS HE HAS A RECEIVER OUTSIDE, SO THERE IS A THREAT OF THE POTENTIAL PASS TO THE INSIDE. HE JUST READ THE EYES AND TOOK HIM TO THE BALL AND UNDERCUTS IT AND ALMOST COMES UP WITH A PICK. >> Al: ETHAN EVANS, 6'3", 250-POUND PUNTER, SENDS IT DOWN TO THE 19 YARD LINE. JACOB COWING BRINGS IT BACK TO THE 27. SO THE GAME BEGINS WITH EACH 2009. RAMS MOVED TO ST. LOUIS. >> Kirk: HOW GOOD OF A PLAYER IS JOHN TAYLOR? JERRY RICE, OBVIOUSLY. BUT SHAWN TAYLOR. >> Al: PURDY. WIDE OPEN TO KITTLE TO THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD TO THE 41 QUINTIN LAKE RUNS HIM DOWN. KITTLE IN HIS EIGHTH YEAR AS PRODUCTIVE AS EVER. 33 YARDS. >> Kirk: THIS IS WHAT HURT THE RAMS DEFENSE EARLY IN THE YEAR. IT WAS JUST MISCUES. THIS TIME, THE FREE SAFETY, QUENTIN LAKE, 37 THERE, GETS HIS EYES IN THE WRONG SPOT AND IT FREES UP A BIG OPENING OVER THE MIDDLE. THAT IS STEALING FOR BROCK PURDY GOING TO HIS MAIN GUY FOR A HUGE GAIN THERE FOR GEORGE KITTLE. >> Al: FIRST FIRST DOWN OF THE GAME FROM THE 41. AND RUNNING THAT TIME WAS GUERENDO. SAMUEL DOESN'T GET THE BALL ENOUGH AND THEN HE WINDS UP IN THE MAN TO THE GROUND. >> Kirk: MISTIMED THERE WITH THE MOTION. BOTH OF THESE TEAMS DO SO MUCH PRESNAP MOVEMENT AT TIMES AND THAT NI THAT NTIME, NOT TIMED UP WELL. GUERENDO WAS AS SURPRISED AS >> Al: HE SUFFERED A FOOT SPRAIN IN SUNDAY'S GAME AND DID NOT KNOW IF HE WOULD PLAY OR NOT UNTIL LAST NIGHT WHEN SHANAHAN SAID HE IS READY TO GO. DRE GREENLAW WITH BOSA. SECOND AND NINE. THROUGH THE RIGHT SIDE THIS TIME. A PICKUP OF THREE. HE STARTED HIS COLLEGE CAREER AT WISCONSIN AND WOUND UP AT LOUISVILLE, FIFTH ROUND PICK. >> Kirk: AMAZING WHEN YOU START IN HIGH SCHOOL AS A RECEIVER AND YOU GET A LITTLE BIT OF WEIGHT. YOU GO TO WISCONSIN AND THEY FLIP YOU AT RUNNING BACK. OOE HE THEN GOES TO LOUISVILLE. GOOD DOWNHILL RUN. MIKE SHANAHAN AND KYLE SHANAHAN, THEY FIND BACKS. THINK WHAT THEY HAVE LOST, NOT JUST McCAFFREY BUT MASON AND MITCHELL IF YOU GO ALL THE WAY BACK. KAYLEE SAID ON THE FOURTH BACK OF THE SEASON. >> Al: HERE IS SAMUEL AND SAMUEL IS TAKEN DOWN AFTER A GAIN OF ONE BY KOBIE TURNER. SAMUEL WANTS THE BALL MORE AND PROBABLY TO GET THE BALL A LOT MORE AS RUNNING BACK TONIGHT. >> Kirk: I THINK A GREAT WAY TO GET HIM TOUCHES ESPECIALLY WITH THE INJURIES THEY HAVE IN THE BACKFIELD. HE HAS DONE THAT THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER. NOT JUST A JET MOTION. I THINK HE HAS 129 CAREER CARRIES AS A RUNNING BACK, SO HE'LL DO THAT TONIGHT. >> Al: 53-YARD FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT HERE FOR JAKE MOODY. HE'S KIND OF HAD A SPOTTY SEASON. PAT O'DONNELL TO PUT IT DOWN. AND FROM 53 OUT, THAT KICK IS JUST INSIDE THE LEFT UPRIGHT. 5:00 INTO THE GAME, THE 49ers TAKE THE LEAD. 3-0. IN THEATERS. SEAN'S GRANDFATHER, JOHN McVAY. A COACH IN THE '70s. WHAT A JOB HE DID TO HELP BUILD THE GREAT 49er TEAMS OF THE '80s AND THE '90s. KICKOFF HERE. FOR THE RAMS, WE TALK ABOUT WHAT IT'S BEEN LIKE OF LATE AFTER THAT TERRIBLE START ENTERING WEEK EIGHT OF "THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL" AGAINST MINNESOTA. THEY WERE 2-4 AND THEY HAD BEATEN VEGAS THE WEEK BEFORE AND ALL KINDS OF TRADE RUMORS ABOUT COOPER KUPP AND PUKA NACUA MISSED FIVE GAMES AND WHAT IS GOING ON OVER THERE? 5-2 SINCE THAT THURSDAY NIGHT GAME. STAFFORD 16 TDs AND THREE PICKS AND 108 RATING SINCE THEN, SO IT'S ALL COME TOGETHER. WE START THIS DRIVE AFTER A THREE-AND-OUT ON THEIR FIRST DRIVE FROM THE 34. THERE IS AT THE 41 YARD LINE, PUKA NACUA, WHO HE IS FABULOUS TO WATCH. >> Kirk: ADD ANOTHER ONE TO HIS BOOK OF CATCHES. IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY WEEK. HERE HE IS WITH HIS FIRST CHANCE. HE CATCHES THIS ON TOP OF HIS HELMET. WARREN IS IN THERE IN COVERAGE. LET ME USE MY HELMET AS I'M SLAMMED TO THE GROUND ON MY WATCH HIM SECURE THIS. LOOK AT THE STRENGTH THIS GUY HAS. THE RIGHT HAND. GETS THAT LEFT HAND AND HOLDS ON FOR DEAR LIFE AND MAKES THAT CATCH. >> Al: RODNEY HARRISON IS HAVING NIGHTMARES. SECOND AND THREE. NO ROOM IN THE MIDDLE. THAT IS BLAKE CORUM, NUMBER TWO BACK, ROOKIE OUT OF MICHIGAN PICKED IN THE THIRD DOWN. THIRD DOWN AND FOUR. >> Kirk: BONGA GAME BACK LAST WEEK AGAINST CHICAGO AND HAD TO DEAL WITH INJURIES THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND HAD ACL LAST YEAR, AND DEALT WITH A WRITST INJURY AND ANKLE INJURY. YOU BRING HIM AND GREENLAW BACK TO THIS DEFENSE AND IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT LOOK. >> Al: FOUR-MAN RUSH. CLEAN POCKET. LUCKY IT WASN'T PICKED. RIGHT IN HIS CHEST AND CAN'T HOLD WAS TONGA. >> HE IS KNOWN FOR HIS ABILITY TO COME UP IN RUN SPORT. LIKE WE SAW THE LAST POSSESSION, THEY ARE DOING A VERY GOOD JOB OF ANTICIPATING THESE SHORTER ROUTES AND JUMPING HIM. HE IS RIGHT THERE. BALL HITS HIM RIGHT OFF THE CHEST. THAT IS THE SECOND TIME THE 49ers HAVE HAD A BALL IN THEIR HANDS. HE'S GOT THE CLUB THERE ON THAT RIGHT HAND. TOUGH TO BRING THAT ONE IN. >> Al: TOO EASY. HERE IS EVANS' PUNT. ANOTHER GOOD ONE. FIELDED AT THE 10. AND BROUGHT BACK TO THE 19 BY JACOB COWING. A PUNT OF 50 YARDS. RETURN OF FIVE. 8:21 TO GO IN THE OPENING QUARTER. 3-0 SAN FRANCISCO. >> Kirk: MATTHEW STAFFORD IS LOOKING OVER SOME THINGS. EVENTUALLY, HE'LL SETTLE IN IN THIS RAMS OFFENSE YOU THINK WOULD GET GOING. THE 49ers, WHILE THEIR DEFENSE IS PLAYING WELL AND GETTING STAFFORD OFF THE FIELD, THEY HAVE GOT TO SEE IF THEY CAN CAPITALIZE ON THESE CHANCES. DEFENSE IS PLAYING GREAT. >> Al: SAMUEL IS LINE UP IN THE WIDE RECEIVER AND RUNNING BACK. HERE HE GOES NOWHERE. BUNCHED UP BY THE RAMS AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. ROZEBOOM IS RIGHT THERE AND LEADING TACKLER FOR THE TEAM. SECOND DOWN. >> Kirk: LIKE I SAID COMING IN TO TONIGHT, 129 CARRIES SINCE ENTERING THE LEAGUE IN 2019 AS A RUNNING BACK. I'M NOT INCLUDING THE JET SWEEPS. I'M TALKING ABOUT LINING OTHERS. CHRISTIAN McCAFFREY, OF COURSE, IS OUT. SO YOU GET A LOT OF THE INJURIES. YOU TURN TO A GUY WHO IS A PHYSICAL, TOUGH, GOOD FEEL FOR RECEIVER IN THAT BACKFIELD. >> Al: SECOND AND NINE. CAUGHT BY SAMUEL. TAKEN DOWN. ANOTHER GUY, YOU KNOW, THAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IS BRANDON AIYUK, NOT PAEP HAEP WITH AIYUK, NOT PAEP HHAPPY WITH HIS CONTRACT AND GOT HURT AND OUT FOR THE SEASON. >> Kirk: HE WAS EVEN OFF TO A SLOW START AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON WHEN HE WAS AVAILABLE BECAUSE OF MISSING SO MUCH TIME IN THE SUMMER. SO THEN HE COMES BACK AND HE GETS THE INJURY. YOU TAKE OUT TRENT WILLIAMS, ONE OF THE BEST TO EVER PLAY AT LEFT TACKLE. McCAFFREY. IT'S REALLY PILED UP ON THE NINERS. >> Al: THIRD AND FOUR. THAT PASS IS INCOMPLETE. THE COVERAGE IS THERE. KITTLE LOOKS FOR A FLAG. THERE IS NONE. KAM PEARL DEFENDING ON THE PLAY. AND IT'S FOURTH DOWN. >> Kirk: WHAT A MATCHUP HERE AND A TOUGH ASK OF KAM CURL BRINGING STABILITY ON THE BACK END THIS YEAR. >> Al: IN A GAME ONLY 8:00 OLD, BETWEEN TWO PRETTY HIGH SCORING TEAMS, THIS IS ALREADY THE FOURTH PUNT OF THE NIGHT. O'DONNELL'S FIRST PUNT WAS 40 YARDS. HE IS PLACING WISHNOWSKY WHO WAS INJURED IN WEEK 11. A SHORT KICK AND LET IT BOUNCE AND IT TAKES A GOOD SAN FRANCISCO BOUNCE AND TURNING INTO A GREAT SAN FRANCISCO BOUNCE. AND DOWNED BACK AT THE 19 YARD LINE. NOT TOO PRETTY, BUT IT WINDS UP VERY PRETTY ON T >> Al: EACH OF THESE GUYS IN THEIR EIGHTH YEAR. SEAN McVAY GOT THE JOB AT THE AGE OF 30. HE HAD BEEN ON THE WASHINGTON STAFF. KYLE SHANAHAN HAD BEEN THE ATLANTA OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. BOTH GETTING THEIR JOBS IN 2017. LONG TIME BUDDIES AND LONG TIME COLLEAGUES BEFORE THAT. KYREN WILLIAMS IS THE RUNNING PLAY ACTION. GOOD PROTECTION. AND THEN FINALLY HE HAS TO CHECK IT DOWN. WILLIAMS MAKES THAT GRAB BUT HE IS SMOTHERED BY GREENLAW. IN TALKING WITH SHANAHAN YESTERDAY, HE WAS TALKING ABOUT GREENLAW AND HE SAID HE REALLY THE GUY FOR THIS DEFENSE. THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE FOR HIM TO SAY THAT. I THINK FRED WARNER IS CLEARLY ONE OF THE TOP LINEBACKERS NOTICE LEAGUE BUT HE WILL TELL YOU IN THIS SCHEME AND HAVING GREENLAW OUT THERE AND THE ENERGY AND TOUGHNESS HE BRINGS, WARNER OUT. I THINK NOBODY IS HAPPIER TO SEE NUMBER 50 OUT THERE THAN FRED WARNER THERE IN THE MIDDLE. >> Al: WILLIAMS GETS TRIPPED UP BY GREENLAW AGAIN AND BY THE SHOELACES THAT TIME. THIRD DOWN. >> Kirk: IT'S INTERESTING THE FIRST TWO THROWS AND ESPECIALLY ON THIRD DOWN. THE SAFETIES FOR THE 49ers, THEY ARE IN THE MIND OF MATTHEW STAFFORD AND IT COULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE THE ADJUSTMENTS MADE BY SEAN McVAY BECAUSE, REMEMBER, BRANDON STALEY, WHO IS ON THE OTHER SIDE WHO HELPED YOU -- RIGHT NOW HELPING ASSISTANT COACH AND HE COACHED WITH THE RAMS AND McVAY IN 2020 AS A DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR. YOU WONDER HOW MUCH HE HAS HELPED THEM WITH THIS SCHEME BECAUSE THOSE SAFETIES ARE DIALED IN ON THIS TRIP. >> Al: GOOD POINT. THREE TO GO. STAFFORD HANGING IN THE POCKET. THROWING. TOO HIGH. INCOMPLETE. SO THE RAMS, WITH COVERAGE ON THE LAST PLAY, STILL WITHOUT A FIRST DOWN ALMOST 10:00 >> Kirk: THEY ARE DOING A GOOD JOB DISRUPTING THE TIMING WITH STAFFED AND THESE RECEIVERS. MIXING UP COVERAGES AND LOOKS. TIGHT COVERAGE THERE WITH WARD GOING UP AGAINST COOPER KUPP IN REALLY TIGHT COVERAGE AT THE BEGINNING OF THAT ROUTE. STAFFORD LOOKED LEFT AND HAD TO COME ALL THE WAY BACK AND THINK BENEFIT, IT WAS TOO LATE TO GET THE BALL TO COOPER KUPP. >> Al: EVANS WITH HIS THIRD PUNT ALREADY OF THE GAME. THIS ONE IS SECURED AT THE 18 LAST WEEK TALKING ABOUT DAN CAMPBELL AND THE MIXING AND MATCHING HE DID ON DEFENSE. YOU SAID AT THE TOP, THOUGH, YOU GOT SOME PRIME TIME GUYS THEY HAVE BEEN MISSING MOST OF THE SEASON OR AT LEAST PARTS OF ALL THE SEASON. FROM THE 22 YARD LINE, PURDY. THROWS TO THE OUTSIDE. HAULED IN BY JENNINGS. REALLY COMING ON. 12-YARD GAIN. KAYLEE? >> Kaylee: WITH THE INJURIES TO THE 49ers, GEORGE KITTLE TOLD ME THAT MEANS THEY HAVE LOST SOME EXPERIENCED PLAYERS WHO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS URGENCY REQUIRED WHEN YOUR BACK IS AGAINST THE WALL LIKE THEIRS IS NOT EVERYONE ON THIS TEAM HAS FELT THAT DESPERATION BEFORE AND KITTLE DIDN'T FEEL IT CLICKED FOR THE YOUNG GUYS UNTIL LAST SUNDAY WHEN HE SAW THEM SCRATCHING AND SHR SCRATCHING AND SHCLAWING AND FIGHTING EVERY SINGLE SNAP. >> Al: THE GRIT HE SAID, WE ARE MISSING THE GRIT. PASS OVERT MIDDLE. PASS OVERT MI THE MIDDLE. GUERENDO MAKES THE PASS. TRENT WILLIAMS IS IT STILL OUT TONIGHT AT LEFT TACKLE. >> Kirk: HE SAID WE NEED THE GRIT BUT NEED TO SEE IT AS A TEAM. THERE IS TRENT WILLIAMS, A BIG GRILT OF THE GRIT OF THE OFFENSIVE LINE AND NOT BECAUSE OF HIS TALENT BUT BECAUSE OF HIS PRESENCE AND WHAT HIS PRESENCE MEANS TO THAT OFFENSIVE LINE AND KIND OF THE PERSONALITY BY THE OFFENSIVE >> Al: JAYLEN MOORE WILL PLAY THAT ROLE AGAINST WILLIAMS COMES GUERENDO FIGHTS AND ANGLES HIS WAY PAST THE 45 FOR A FIRST DOWN FOR SAN FRANCISCO. YOUNG MAKES THE STOP. >> Kirk: THAT IS WHERE YOU FIND OUT HOW THAT FOOT IS DOING WHEN YOU HAVE TO RUN THROUGH SOME TACKLES. HE RAN RIGHT THROUGH KOBIE TURNER. 91 IS CHASING HIM. HE EVENTUALLY BOUNCES RIGHT OFF OF HIM. THAT EXTRA EFFORT, THAT SPIN GETS HIM THAT FIRST DOWN. SO FAR, THAT FOOT IS HOLDING UP VERY NICELY FOR HIM. >> Al: FOUR CARRIES FOR HIM, 11 3:30 LEFT IN THE QUARTER AND SAN FRANCISCO LEADING 3-0. KITTLE IS THE MOTION MAN. AGAIN, THEY GIVE IT TO GUERENDO. TALK ABOUT THE THE GUYS THEY ARE MISSING AND McCAFFREY IS NUMBER ONE. JORDAN MASON HAS DONE A NICE JOB AND ELIJAH MITCHELL WOULD BE NUMBER THREE AND DOWN THE LIST HERE TO GUERENDO. >> Kirk: IF GUGUERENDO'S FOOT DOESN'T HOLD UP, PATRICK TAYLOR OUT OF MEMPHIS WOULD BE NUMBER FIVE AND, OF COURSE, DEEBO SAMUEL WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP OUT AS WELL. IT'S BEEN THAT KIND OF YEAR. >> Al: THERE IS TAYLOR. HE SAW A LITTLE BIT OF ACTION LAST WEEK. NOT MUCH BEFORE THAT. SECOND DOWN AND SIX. BALL RIGHT ON THE 50. KNOCKED DOWN. FOR A PLAY THERE BY WITHER SAMOAN COMING UP FOR COBIE DURANT WHO IS HURT. >> Kirk: SECOND TIME TRIED HIM TO THE QUICK SLANT AND BOTH TIMES HE HAS DONE A GOOD JOB OF POSITIONING HIMSELF NOT TO KNOCK THE BALL AWAY. REMEMBER, HE IS A VETERAN. HE REALLY HAS A FEEL. YOU CAN SEE JENNINGS TRIED TO SELL HIM LIKE HE WAS GOING DOWN THE FIELD AND GOING BY HIM ON A GO ROUTE AND THEN PUT THE BRAKES ON, BUT NOT FOOLED AT ALL. A REALLY GOOD JOB DEFENDING THAT. >> Al: FORMER 49er AND SEVENTH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE IS WITHERSPOON. THIRD DOWN AND SIX NOW. JUSTICE JUSZCZYK IN THE THEY GET PURDY AT THE 46 YARD KOBIE TURNER NUMBER 91. THE REPEAT "MASKED SINGER" FAME GETS THE SACK. >> Kirk: THEY SHOW PRESSURE AND ONLY BRING FOUR. YOU SEE HIM WALK UP. YOUNG DROPS BUT THERE IS A NICE STUNT THERE. I THINK IT CAUSED ENOUGH CONFUSION THERE THAT EVENTUALLY NOBODY DOWN THE FIELD AND THEY COLLAPSE THE POCKET ON PURDY. >> Al: O'DONNELL WITH HIS PUNT. SIXTH PUNT OF THE QUARTER. FAIR CATCH CALLED FOR AND MADE AT THE 16 YARD LINE BY XAVIER SMITH. EXACTL IN CIVIL RIGHTS AND PRESENTED TWO SUPER BOWL TICKETS. HE HAS BEEN A GREAT MENTOR FOR A LOT OF ATHLETES. I GOT TO KNOW HIM THROUGH THE YEARS. ACROSS ALL SPORTS. CONGRATULATIONS TO DR. EDWARDS. >> Kirk: ABSOLUTELY. >> Al: SPRINGS KLES NOW. SHOWERS OFF AND ON. RAMS LOOKING FOR A FIRST DOWN FOR THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT. >> Kirk: SPEAKING OF FIRST TIME. GREAT TO SEE DRE GREENLAW BACK PLAYING FOOTBALL. HE HAD THE INJURY THAT AL TALKED ABOUT AND JOGGING OUT ON THE FIELD IN THE SUPER BOWL AND TORE HIS ACHILLES. HE LOOKED TODAY LIKE HE IS PLAYING IN ANOTHER SUPER BOWL. HE HAS WORKED SO HARD FOR THIS MOMENT. HE'S BEEN ON THE FIELD NOW FOR ALL 11 SNAPS FOR THIS 49ers DEFENSE AND IS FLYING AROUND. >> Al: NO PITCH COUNT FOR HIM, AT LEAST TO THIS POINT OF THE BUT, FOR THE MOMENT NOW, FRED WARNER IS PLAYING WITH A BROKEN BONE IN HIS ANKLE SINCE EARLY IN THE SEASON AND WAS FLEXING THE LEG AND HE WALKS OUT AND HAS TO BE OUT FOR AT LEAST ONE PLAY. >> Kirk: HE PLAYS SO HARD. I THINK AT THE END OF THIS PLAY, HE KIND OF GETS NEAR MAKE THE PLAY AND RIGHT THERE, JUST THE WAY HE LANDED. WATCH THIS. JUST AWKWARD THE WAY HE CAME NOBODY PLAYS HARDER THAN FRED WARNER. >> Al: SECOND AND SEVEN. HAS TO CHECK IT DOWN! HE IS LUCKY THAT ONE WASN'T PICKED. BLAKE CORUM, THE INTENDED RECEIVER AND WHO ELSE IS OVER THERE? GREENLAW. THIRD AND SEVEN. GREEN SHORTSTOP LAW IS ALL OVER GREENLAW IS ALL OVER THE PLACE. >> HE IS. BLAKE CORUM, WATCHING HIM IN COLLEGE A NUMBER OF YEARS IN MICHIGAN. THE ROOKIE CAN CATCH THE VERY SIMILAR BACK STYLE WISE TO KYREN WILLIAMS. THE BALL JUST GOES RIGHT OFF HIS WE GOT ANOTHER THIRD DOWN. WE HAVE NOT SEEN EITHER TEAM CONVERT A THIRD DOWN YET TONIGHT. >> Al: RAMS DON'T HAVE A FIRST WARNER IS BACK IN. ATWELL IS THE MAN IN MOTION. GOING THAT WAY. AND TOO HIGH. INTENDED FOR DeMARCUS ROBINSON. WARD COVERING ON THE PLAY. SO THE RAMS, WITHOUT A FIRST DOWN, AND WE ARE, FOLKS, GOING TO HAVE OUR SEVENTH PUNT OF THE >> Kirk: BOY, THIS 49ers SECONDARY IS REALLY DOING A GOOD JOB OF MIXING UP THE LOOKS AND KEEPING STAFFORD AND THESE RECEIVERS GUESSING. STAFFORD, WHO CAME IN PLAYING AS WELL AS ANYBODY THESE LAST FOUR WEEKS JUST LOOKS UNSETTLED AND HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND HIS RHYTHM YET WITHIN THE OFFENSE. >> Al: EVANS WITH A LINE DRIVE KICK BUT A LOT OF DISTANCE AND IT'S A BEAUTY AS IT TURNS OUT. IT'S FIELDED BACK AT THE 14 YARD LINE BY COWING. HE BRINGS IT BACK OUT TO THE 30 THAT WAS ON A LINE. BUT FOR SURE. AGAIN, LIGHT RAIN COMING DOWN. FOUR STRAIGHT DRIVES WITHOUT A FIRST DOWN. >> Kirk: HOW ABOUT ABOUT THAT? >> Al: FIRST TIME THAT HAS HAPPENED TO SEAN McVAY. 49ers HAVE THREE FIRST DOWNS AND THREE POINTS. THE PASS IS CAUGHT BUT ONLY A ONE-YARD GAIN BY GUERENDO AND TAKEN DOWN BY MICHAEL HOYT. >> Kirk: ONE OF THE FIRST WE WILL SEE OF HIM TONIGHT AND SEE ON BOTH SIDES. THE TIMING OF THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT TO GET THE LINEMAN DOWN THE FIELD. THE RAMS DEFENSE, YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. I THINK SEAN McVAY AND LES SNEAD ARE PROUD OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD HERE WITH THE YOUNG NUCLEUS OF PLAYERS. >> Al: WHEN THE 49ers CHANGED REGIMES AND SHANAHAN CAME IN WITH JOHN LYNCH, FIRST THING THEY DID WAS BUILD THAT DEFENSIVE FRONT. GET A PASS RUSH. NOW THE RAMS ARE THE TEAM THAT FLIPPED IT ON THE 49ers. >> Kirk: I THINK THEY HAD TO. SO MUCH CONCERN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITHOUT AARON DONALD? THEY FOUND NOT ONE BUT FIVE OR SIX GUYS TO TRY TO HELP MAKE THAT A STRENGTH ACROSS THE BOARD. >> Al: THERE IS JOHN LYNCH. THE RAIN IS COMING DOWN A LITTLE BIT HARDER >> Al: END OF ONE. 3-0, SAN FRANCISCO ON TOP. NEXT WEEK, FIRST-EVER THURSDAY NIGHT FLEX GAME AS WE GO TO LOS ANGELES. BRONCOS AND CHARGERS PRETTY MUCH IN THE PLAYOFF HUNT AND KANSAS CITY ON TOP OF THAT TWDIVISION. DENVER AND LOS ANGELES TRYING TO GET TO THE TOURNAMENT NEXT THURSDAY NIGHT. WE START HERE FROM THE 36 YARD LINE, THIRD DOWN AND FOUR. A FLAG HERE. >> Kirk: DEEBO SAMUEL MOVING A LITTLE EARLY. >> Referee: FALSE START, OFFENSE NUMBER 1. FIVE-YARD PENALTY. >> Al: SAMUEL. THIRD AND NINE NOW. >> Kirk: HE WAS JUST ANXIOUS TO GET OUT OF HIS STANCE AND TRY TO GET DOWN FIELD HERE. HE JUMPS A LITTLE BIT EARLY. HE TALKS ABOUT TOUCHES AND OPPORTUNITIES. HE HAS FOUR TOUCHES, A COUPLE OF CARRIES, A COUPLE OF RECEPTIONS ALREADY TONIGHT. >> Al: PENALTY-FREE GAME TO TH POINT. EACH TEAM WITH ONE. THAT PASS -- OF COURSE, THE MINUTE I SAY IT, HERE COMES A FLAG AS JAUAN JENNINGS MAKES THE CATCH AND HE IS OUT OF BOUNDS ON THE RAMS SIDE OF THE FIELD. >> Kirk: YEAH, ARE THEY GETTING THAT ON THE DEFENSE FOR GRABBING ON? WITHERSPOON IS THERE IN COVERAGE AGAINST JENNINGS. >> Al: 49ers SEEM TO THINK SO AS THEY ARE MOVING UP TOWARD MIDFIELD. >> Kirk: HANDLING THE FOOTBALL PRETTY WELL. HE HAS A BIG HAND. THROWING A PRETTY TIGHT SPIRAL HERE. >> Referee: HOLDING DEFENSE NUMBER 4. >> Kirk: HE LOVES THE OUT CUT AND TIMING OF THAT AND JENNINGS HAS HAD TO STEP UP FOR THIS OFFENSE. WEEK THREE WHEN HE WENT UP AGAINST THE RAMS, HE HAD A MONSTER GAME WITH 11 CATCHES AND 175 YARDS AND THREE TOUCHDOWNS. I FEEL THE OFFENSE AND THE WEATHER AND THE RESPECT THEY HAVE FOR EACH OTHER'S DEFENSE ARE JUST FEELING EACH OTHER OUT AND EVENTUALLY LOOKING FOR SOME BIGGER SHOTS DOWN FIELD. >> Al: WE ARE ONLY IN A THIRD ROUND OF A FIGHT AND TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT. GUERENDO GOES NOWHERE. SECOND DOWN AND LONG. >> Kirk: ROZEBOOM WHO LEADS THE RAMS IN TACKLES. THE RAMS UP FRONT, WE WERE BRAGGING ABOUT THEIR DEFENSIVE LINE AND THEY DO A PRETTY GOOD JOB KEEPING HIM CLEAN. YOU'LL SEE HIM IN THE RUN GAME AND SO IMPORTANT WHEN YOU DEFEND KYLE SHANAHAN. HE GETS DOWNHILL AND MAKES A LOT OF TACKLES. >> Al: SHANAHAN IS PACING AND TRYING TO GET A BETTER LOOK FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE. 50 YARD LINE. SECOND DOWN AND NINE. GOING DEEP! AND A LOT OF CONTACT. A LOT OF ACTION BUT THERE IS NO FLAG. KAM CURL IS THERE WITH GEORGE KITTLE. GOOD BATTLE. >> Kirk: THEY FLEXED HIM OUT AND MOTION BY DEEBO SAMUEL AND THAT CREATES A ONE-ON-ONE OPPORTUNITY WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THE NINERS WANT. WE SAW CURL EARLIER GO ONE-ON-ONE WITH A SHORTER ROUTE AND NOW HE IS DOWN FIELD AND NEVER REALLY FINDS THE FOOTBALL. I THINK THERE IS CONTACT THERE. VERY EASILY COULD HAVE BEEN A CALL AND THE MAIN REASON IS THE CONTACT AND WITHOUT GETTING A HEAD TURNED AROUND. >> Al: KEPT THE FLAG IN THE POCKET. BUT IT'S THIRD DOWN AND NINE. PURDY UNDER PRESSURE. FIRES IN TO TRAFFIC AND JENNINGS WAS THE INTENDED RECEIVER AND JENNINGS CAN'T HOLD ON. FOURTH DOWN. >> Kirk: KOBI TURNER HERE. HE DOESN'T GET A SACK BUT IT JUST GIVES YOU AN IDEA HOW POWERFUL THIS GUY IS. HE ALWAYS KEEPS -- PEOPLE KEEP REFERRING TO HIM -- NO ONE IS EVER THE NEXT AARON DONALD BUT HE IS A GUY THAT HAS KIND OF MOVED INTO THAT POSITION. HE HAS GOT QUICKNESS. THAT TIME, HE SHOWS SOME POWER ON THAT RUSH. >> Al: O'DONNELL'S PUNT. CALLED FOR A FAIR CATCH AND THEN LET IT BOUNCE AND TRIED TO FOOL THE 49ers BUT, NO, SIR. DOWN AT THE 2 YARD LINE BY TONGES. 49ers ON TOP >> Kirk: HOW MANY TIMES YOU WATCH A GAME ON THE WEEKEND WHERE THE GUNNER NEVER FINDS THE FOOTBALL? VERY DISCIPLINED JOB OF COMING DOWN FIELD. WELL SCHOOLED. JUST LOOKING FOR THE BALL. FINDS THE BALL. AND THEN JUST IS AWARE OF WHERE THAT GOAL LINE IS AND KEEPS HIS FEET AND THE BALL OUTSIDE OF THE GOAL LINE. GREAT JOB. >> Al: SO THE RAMS NOW 13 PLAYS FOR 23 YARDS. A TEAM THAT SCORED 44 POINTS FOUR DAYS AGO. A LITTLE BIT OF A HOLE THAT CLOSES QUICKLY FOR KYREN WILLIAMS. 44 POINTS. THEY COULDN'T STOP THEM, BUFFALO LAST WEEK BUT TONIGHT, THEY JUST NOW GET A FIRST DOWN. >> Kirk: SO TRUE. ONE WEEK TO THE NEXT IN THE NFL. SEAN McVAY NOT JUST LAST WEEK BUT THE LAST THREE OR FOUR WEEKS MOMENTUM. GREAT TO SEE FRED WARNER FLYING AROUND AFTER GOING OFF THE >> Al: HE JUST MISSED ONE PLAY. SECOND AND EIGHT. KEEP IT ON THE GROUND. NICE MOVE. THERE IS YOUR INITIAL FIRST DOWN FOR THE RAMS TONIGHT. KYREN WILLIAMS SPINNING HIS WAY TO A FIRST DOWN AT THE 15 YARD >> Kirk: BEAU LIMMER A GOOD JOB AT THE SECOND LEVEL. HOW ABOUT THE TWO RECEIVERS? PUKA NACUA, 17. COOPER KUPP HELPING OUT AS WELL. BOTH GUYS ARE WILLING. YOU KNOW, ONE THING ABOUT THIS RAMS OFFENSE IS THE RECEIVERS GET UP THERE AND THEY BLOCK. NOT JUST BLOCKING CORNERS BUT THEY GET IN THERE AND BLOCK LINEBACKERS AND SAFETIES AND GOOD TOUGH RUNNING THAT TIME BY >> Al: TOSS. HUH-UH. RIGHT THERE WHO TAKES HIM DOWN FOR A LOSS. NOT FOOLED. >> Kirk: IF YOU'RE A NINERS FAN, YOU THINK WHY COULDN'T WE HAVE BEEN HEALTHY ALL YEAR? GREENLAW IS BACK AND FUNGA COMES BACK LAST WEEK. THEY GO TO A CRACK TOSS. HE GETS OUT THERE AND GETS OFF THAT BLOCK. I THINK HE IS A GREAT DEFENDER AND PLAYING WITH INSTINCTS. NOT JUST AGAINST THE RUN BUT PLAYS WITH DISCIPLINE AND BACK END AS WELL. >> Al: SECOND DOWN AND 12. STAFFORD IS 2 OF 8. HE HANDS THE BALL OFF HERE TO THE 15 YARD LINE. FRED WARNER TAKES HIM DOWN. IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN. >> Kirk: REMEMBER, THIS IS AN OFFENSIVE LINE THAT FINALLY GOTTEN HEALTHY. THEY HAVE HAD SOME INJURIES THE LAST FEW WEEKS. THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THE PIECES TOGETHER. THEY PLAYED A LOT OF FOOTBALL TOGETHER AND THEY ARE FINDING IT TO BE VERY, VERY TOUGH AGAINST THIS SAN FRANCISCO DEFENSE HERE ON A THURSDAY NIGHT. >> Al: SEVEN DIFFERENT OFFENSIVE LINE COMBINATIONS FOR THE RAMS. STAFFORD IS 2 OF 8 FOR 11 YARDS. AFTER HE HAD A MONSTER GAME ON SUNDAY. DEEP DROP. ESCAPING. GOING RUN AND PICK UP THAT FIRST DOWN AND WARNER TRIED TO TAKE THE BALL AWAY AFTER THE PLAY WAS WHISTLED DEAD. FIRST DOWN, LOS ANGELES. >> Kirk: WHEN IT'S THIRD DOWN LIKE THAT, AL, IT'S A GREAT JOB, IN MY OPINION, OF NOT SLIDING. STAFFORD AT 36 YEARS OLD, GREAT AWARENESS. RUNNING AWAY FROM BOSA. SOMETIMES YOU SLIDE, THEY BRING IT ALL THE WAY BACK BECAUSE IT'S WHERE THAT KNEE TOUCHES. HERE, HE GOES FORWARD AND IS ABLE TO GET THAT FIRST DOWN. >> Al: OF COURSE, THE FLIP SIDE IS SOMETIMES YOU GO HEAD FIRST AND YOU'RE BACK IN THE TENT. >> Kirk: THAT'S TRUE. BUT HE PROTECTED HIMSELF THERE. >> Al: BALL AT THE 26. QUICK THROW HERE. PUKA GETS A LOT OF YARDS AFTER CONTACT AS IS NORMAL. BOSA MAKES A STOP THERE. >> Kirk: BOSA WAS EXPECTING THAT BALL TO POTENTIALLY BE COMING OUT. HE KIND OF LOOKS AT IT FLY OVER HIS HEAD. INSTEAD OF GIVING UP ON IT, THIS IS WHAT YOU LOVE TO SEE FROM NICK BOSA. THE SUPERSTAR SEES IT AND INSTEAD OF GIVING UP ON IT, HE GOES FULL SPEED AND CHASES IT THIS IS MORE OF WHAT THE RAMS EXPECTED. REMEMBER, THEY STARTED THIS DRIVE AFTER A REALLY ROUGH NIGHT ON THEIR OWN 2 YARD LINE AND PICKING UP A FEW FIRST DOWNS >> Al: SECOND AND TWO. AND GETTING THOSE TWO IS KYREN RAMS NOW THREE FIRST DOWNS THIS DRIVE STARTING AT THEIR OWN 2 YARD LINE. >> Kirk: THIS IS THE RHYTHM THAT THEY TALK ABOUT. McVAY REMINDING US THIS WEEK ABOUT STAFFORD AND THESE RECEIVERS, THEY ARE HEALTHY AND GO TO A LOT OF ATTENTION. HE SAID MAKE NO MISTAKE, WHEN OUR LINE HEALTHY, THIS ENTIRE OPERATION STARTS WITH OUR ABILITY TO RUN THE BALL. EVEN WHEN WE TALKED ON THE OTHER SIDE, KYLE HAND SHAUN SIDE, KYLE HANDSHANAHAN SAID IF CAN'T STOP THEM FROM RUNNING, IT'S A LONG NIGHT FOR OUR DEFENSE. THAT IS THE BATTLE UP FRONT AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. >> Al: STAFFORD. EYES DOWN THE FIELD. NACUA THE INTENDED RECEIVER. THROWN OUT OF BOUNDS. SECOND AND TEN. >> Kirk: NINERS DOING A GREAT JOB WITH JUST THEIR FRONT AND ABLE TO APPLY THAT PRESSURE. THEY GOT TO STAFFORD. HERE IS PUKA. LOOK AT HIM ON HIS ROUTE AND GETTING BEHIND ROBINSON AND TRYING TO JUST USE HIM AS A SHIELD BUT THEY HAVE GOT HIM LOCKED DOWN. LOOK. YOU HAVE FOUR DIFFERENT 49ers AROUND NUMBER 17. THAT IS ONE WAY TO STOP HIM. >> Al: YEAH. >> Kirk: THERE IS THE PRESSURE AGAIN ON STAFFORD. >> Al: CONNRNERS COVERAGE. HE RUNS INTO HIS OWN MAN. HE RAN INTO HUNTER LONG. IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND FIVE. WILLIAMS ALREADY WITH NINE CARRIES NOW. 28 YARDS. NOT ONLY IS IT RAINING NOW, IT'S GOTTEN A LOT CHILLIER. TEMPERATURE ABOUT 50 DROPPING. >> Kirk: REMEMBER, THE RAMS DID NOT GIVE UP A SACK LAST WEEK AGAINST THAT TALENTED BILLS SEE HOW THEY DO HERE ON THIS THIRD DOWN ON THE EDGES. >> Al: BOSA TRYING TO GET TO HIM. AND HE HAS TO BACKHAND IT. BACKHAND FLIP. PRESSURE COMING FROM BEHIND HIM. YOU HAD GROSS-MATOS THE DEFENSIVE PLAYER INFAN DEFENSIVE PLAYER INNFC OF THE WE PUTTING THE PRESSURE ON. >> Kirk: THEY CAN MOVE HIM INSIDE LIKE THIS. IT KEEPS LEONARD FLOYD AND BOSA ON THE FIELD. HE BRINGS THAT KIND OF VERSATILITY AND CHASES STAFFORD OUSTED POCKET AND ALMOST COMES UP WITH A SACK AFTER THE THREE HE HAD A WEEK AGO. >> Al: EVANS. THE BALL BOUNCES AND WILL ROLL TO A STOP AT ABOUT THE 10. SECOND WEEK IN A ROW THE 49ers HAVE FORCED A PUNT ON THE FIRST FIVE DRIVES OF AN OPPONENT. CHICAGO LAST WEEK. CHRISTIAN McCAFFREY OF ALL THOSE BACKS IS A FIRST ROUND PICK. >> Al: DAVIS WAS A SIXTH ROUNDER. HOW MANY GUYS DO YOU GET IN THE SIXTH ROUND? TOM BRADY, MAYBE? RIGHT! NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. >> Al: NO. ON FIRST DOWN, IT'S DROPPED. JAUAN JENNINGS, NORMALLY PRETTY SURE HANDED AND YOUNG COVERING ON THE PLAY. >> Kirk: THESE CONDITIONS ARE IMPACTING THE RECEIVERS IN THE PASSING GAME. BOTH COACHES TRYING TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PLAN THAT THEY HAD COMING IN. AND TRYING TO MAKE SOME TWEAKS. THIS IS REAL. THESE CONDITIONS ARE NOT LETTING UP. >> Al: STEADY RAIN. TELLING US IT'S GOING TO STOP IN A HALF-HOUR. WHO KNOWS. ON THE GROUND. TOUGH TWO YARDS FOR ISAAC GUERENDO WHO HAS CARRIED SEVEN TIMES BUT ONLY 18 YARDS. >> Kirk: GOOD JOB SETTING THE EDGE AND DEEBO SAMUEL, WE WERE JUST BRAGGING ABOUT THE RAMS RECEIVERS. DEEBO SAMUEL COMES OFF THE EDGE AND JUST KIND OF WHIFFS THERE AND TRYING TO MAKE A BLOCK ON KAM CURL. BOTH OF THESE TEAMS RELY ON THE PEMETER BLOCKING WHEN IT COMES TO RUNNING THE FOOTBALL. >> Al: THIRD DOWN. JUSZCZYK IN THE BACKFIELD AND ACCEPTED HIM OVER THE MIDDLE. PURDY THROWS. UP TO THE 22 YARD LINE. KITTLE HAULS IT IN TO CONVERT A COVERED BY WITHERSPOON. >> Kirk: JAKE BRENDEL DOES A HECK OF A JOB. LOOK AT THE OVERLOAD HERE. THE POTENTIAL THREAT AND HE JUST SENSES THAT POSSIBILITY AND COMES OVER LATE TO HELP OUT. THAT IS REALLY GOOD RECOGNITION THERE IN PASSING ON A THIRD DOWN AND, WHEN IN DOUBT, WET CONDITIONS, PUT IT UP TO NUMBER 85 IN ONE-ON-ONE COVERAGE AND KITTLE WILL COME DOWN WITH IT. >> Al: RAMS ALMOST JUMP OFFSIDE. THAT WAS JARED VERSE WHO GOT THAT TIME BYRON YOUNG TAKES GUERENDO DOWN IN THE BACKFIELD. GUERENDO NOW EIGHT CARRIES A 16 YARDS. >> Kirk: GREAT JOB. BOBBY BROWN 95 WINS. OMAR SPEIGHTS, THE LINEBACKER COMES INSIDE. THE ONLY PLACE HE CAN GO IS TRY TO BOUNCE A TEN WHEN HE BOUNCES IT, YOUNG GETS OFF THE BLOCK. VERSE GETS MOST OF THE ATTENTION, THE ROOKIE. THE SECOND-YEAR MAN OUT OF TENNESSEE IS RELENTLESS AND PLAYS REALLY GOOD WITH AWARENESS WITH HIS EYES IN THE BACKFIELD. >> Al: SECOND AND 11. DOWN THE SIDELINE. HE GOT FREE BUT THE PASS IS TOO LONG FOR JAUAN JENNINGS. THIRD AND 11. NO DOUBT, WEATHER IS A BIG FACTOR. >> Kirk: OH, YEAH. YEAH. >> Al: TRYING TO FIND THEIR MEN AND DROPPING A COUPLE OF PASSES HERE AND THERE. >> Kirk: CHRIS SHULA, THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR FROM THE RAMS, NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE HIS GUYS ON ISLANDS. THAT IS PART OF WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO AGAINST THIS SAN FRANCISCO YOU GOT TO TAKE SOME CHANCES AND TO DO THAT YOUR CORNERBACKS AND LINEBACKERS AND SAFETIES HAVE GOT TO HOLD UP. >> Al: PURDY ESCAPES. NOT FOR FAR. NOT FOR LONG. KOBIE TURNER IS THERE. HE MIGHT HAVE PICKED UP A FIRST HE HAD ENOUGH SPACE BUT TURNER GETS HIM FROM BEHIND TO FORCE A >> Kirk: WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT HIM AND WHAT HE FACES. NOT JUST FROM THE "MASKED SINGER" BUT THE GUY CAN PLAY HE IS A GUY THAT WALKED ON AT RICHMOND AND THEN HE GOES TO WAKE FOREST AND, YOU KNOW, A GUY THAT THEY REALLY THOUGHT COULD BECOME A GREAT PLAYER AND HAS BECOME KIND OF A LEADER OF THAT FRONT. GOOD JOB OF BEING -- PLAYING WITH A HIGH MOTOR THERE AND NOT GIVE UP ON IT. >> Al: HERE COMES O'DONNELL'S FIFTH PUNT OF THE NIGHT. LINE DRIVE SPINNER AT THE 36 YARD LINE AND XAVIER SMITH -- FLAG IS DOWN. FLAG DOWN AT THE 14 YARD LINE AND NEAR THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. RELATIVE PENALTY-FREE GAME. ONLY ONE ACCEPTED FOR EACH TEAM. CLAY MARTIN WILL TELL US ABOUT THIS ONE. RAMS/49ers. I THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE A SHOOT-OUT AND IT'S TURNED OUT TO BE A PUNT-ATHON. GO FIGURE. WHO KNEW? >> Referee: ILLEGAL FORMATION ON SAN FRANCISCO. THEY HAD FIVE PLAYERS IN THE THE RAMS WILL ENFORCE THE FIVE-YARD PENALTY AT THE END OF IT'S FIRST DOWN. TIME-OUT. >> Kirk: STAFFORD HAS GOT GREAT FIELD POSITIOO GO. >> Al: ABSOLUTELY. SPEND AN SPENTIRE WEEK AND WHEREVER WE ARE. THE RAMS BEGIN THIS DRIVE AND DOWN 3-0. THEY START ON THE GROUND. NEITHER TEAM DOING ANYTHING ON THE GROUND TONIGHT. THAT IS KYREN WILLIAMS TAKEN DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE THERE. >> Kirk: THE 49ers DEFENSE KNEW AGAINST SEAN McVAY. WE TALKED ABOUT HOW IT STARTS WITH THEIR ABILITY TO RUN. LOOK AT THIS. THEY HAVE HAD FIVE POSSESSIONS. FINALLY PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER ON THE LAST DRIVE WHERE THEY STARTED AT THEIR OWN 3, BUT THEY CAME IN KNOWING THEY HAD TO STOP THE RUN AND FIRST AND TEN, BOY, THOSE LINEBACKERS ARE FLYING DOWNHILL AND BOTH GREENLAW AND >> Al: FIRST TIME THE RAMS HAVE BEEN AS FAR AS THE 50 YARD LINE AGAIN, WILLIAMS. LOOK AT HIM GO. LOOK AT HIM GO! WOW! YARDS AFTER CONTACT. >> Kirk: HE WOULD NOT STOP. I THINK IT LOOKED LIKE A TWO-YARD GAIN. HE JUST WOULDN'T STOP. THE OFFENSIVE LINEMEN GOT BEHIND HIM AND THEY KEPT PUSHING. JACKSON GETS IN THERE, THE LEFT LOOK AT HIS LEG DRIVE. LOOK AT THAT LEG DRIVE! TALK ABOUT DETERMINATION! AND THE LINEMEN FEED OFF OF THE WHOLE TEAM DOES. >> Al: HE GOT FIVE ON A PUSH/PUSH. THIRD AND ONE. KUPP IN MOTION. WILLIAMS HAS ENOUGH. 3:22 UNTIL THE HALF. >> Kaylee: IF THIS RAIN KEEPS COMING DOWN HARDER AND HARDER, THE RAMS SIDELINE IS MAKING PREPARATIONS, IF NEEDED. ONE STAFFER FILLING EQUIPMENT CASE OVER HERE WITH EXTRA PAIRS OF CLEATS IN CASE OF PLAYERS SHOULD ASK FOR A BIGGER SPIKES IF THEY NEED MORE TRACTION. UNDERNEATH ONE TARP IS TACK STACK OF DRY GLOVES AND THEY ARE BRINGING OFF THE MATTES AS GUYS ARE CLEANING OFF THE CLEATS AS THEY GET MUDDY. >> Al: YOU WILL HAVE A WARDROBE CHANGE AT THE HALF? >> Kaylee: I WISH. >> Al: 38 YARD LINE. WILLIAMS PICKS UP THREE A WORK HORSE TONIGHT. HE HAD 29 CARRIES LAST WEEK. HE HAS 13 TONIGHT. >> Kirk: 42 AS AN OFFENSE, THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE GOT TO, AGAIN, ESTABLISH THAT. WHAT I THINK IT SETS UP -- NOW THE WEATHER CONDITIONS MAY GET TOUGH, BUT IT DEFINITELY ALLOWS YOU TO SET UP THE PLAY ACTION ON EARLY DOWNS AND TAKE SOME SHOTS WITH THE WAY THESE SAFETIES AND BACKERS ARE GETTING DOWNHILL AGAINST THE RUN. WILL THEY RUN A PLAY BEFORE THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING? THEY DO. IT'S NICK BOSA RIGHT THERE TO STOP WILLIAMS AND TAKES US TO THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING WITH 1:56 REMAINING IN THE HALF. BY PLAYIN HE IS 43. >> Kirk: HE IS 43 PLAYING 33. >> Al: RIGHT. QUICK FLIP OUT HERE. NACUA. WARNER IS RIGHT THERE TO STUFF SO NOW IT'S FOURTH DOWN. SO THE FIELD GOAL KICKER IS JOSH KARTY. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A 48-YARD LINE FIELD GOAL. AT THE MOMENT, THEY ARE KEEPING THE OFFENSE OUT THERE. AT THE ENDS OF THE BUFFALO GAME LAST WEEK, THEY MADE A MONSTER FOURTH AND FIVE ON A PASS TO TUTU ATWELL. HERE THEY LINE UP TO GO FOR IT ON FOURTH AND TWO. PLAY CLOCK AT 5. THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO DRAW THEM OFFSIDE. THEY WILL BRING KARTI IN HERE. THEY SCORED 44 LAST WEEK. THE OTHER TEAM ROUTING CHICAGO. TOUCHDOWNS GALORE. 3-0 TONIGHT. THE WEATHER, OBVIOUSLY, HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT EVEN THOUGH IT'S ABATING RIGHT NOW. >> Kirk: YOU'RE ON CUE WITH THE RAIN. YOU HAD IT DOWN. YOU SAID IT WAS GOING TO STOP IN 30 MINUTES. IT STOPPED. BUT THEY SAID 40% OF CHANCE AND IT'S BEEN RAINING THE ENTIRE FIRST HALF. HOPEFULLY IT WILL DRY OUT A LITTLE BIT AND WE WILL GET MORE OFFENSE GOING IN THE SECOND HALF. >> Al: THEY DON'T CALL ME DOPPLER DOCTOR FOR NOTHING. >> Kirk: YOU'RE ALL OVER IT. >> Al: KARTY IS A ROOKIE OUT OF STANFORD AND PLAYED HIS COLLEGE BALL RIGHT UP THE ROAD. THIS TO TIE THE GAME. AND KARTY'S KICK IS RIGHT DOWN THE 101. 65 SECONDS UNTIL HALFTIME. 3-3 ON "THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL." >> Al: THE FIELD GOAL WAS GOOD BUT LOOK AT THIS. BIG LEFT HAND OF JORDAN ELLIOTT WHO IS 6'5" AND IT STILL WENT DOWN THE MIDDLE. >> Kirk: JUST OFF THE TOP OF THAT FINGERTIP. BUT HE REALLY DROVE THAT BALL. GOOD SNAP. GOOD HOLD. LOOK AT THAT. BALL NOT AFFECTED AT ALL BY THAT FINGERTIP. >> Al: SHOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN A MANICURE. 49ers WILL TAKE IT AT THE 30 UPDATE THE PLAYOFF PICTURE AS WE START WEEK NUMBER 15. YOU GOT DETROIT CLENCHING 9 BIRTH AND PHILLY AS WELL AND SEATTLE LEADS THE WEST AND TAMPA BAY 7-6. VIKINGS AND GREEN BAY AND WASHINGTON, AT THE MOMENT, WOULD BE THE WILDCARD TEAMS. OF COURSE, THE DIVISION WINNERS OR DIVISION LEADERS WILL WIND UP GETTING A WILDCARD GAME AT HOME. TRENT WILLIAMS, OF COURSE, THEY MISS HIM. THE LEFT TACKLE. THERE HE IS MISSING HIS FOURTH TEN DAYS OFF BEFORE THEIR NEXT MIGHT GET HIM BACK. THEIR NEXT GAME WILL BE A WEEK FROM SUNDAY. DEEBO SAMUEL HERE PICKS UP ABOUT SIX. NEXT GAME IS AT MIAMI. >> Kirk: PURDY JUST OVER 100 YARDS HERE IN THIS FIRST HALF. KYLE SHANAHAN WITH THREE TIME-OUTS IS THINKING AT LEAST GETTING IN FIELD GOAL RANGE EW. >> Al: PASS OVER THE MIDDLE IS INCOMPLETE AND TRYING TO GET IT TO RICKY PEARSALL, FIRST TIME HE HAS BEEN TARGETED TONIGHT. TRENTON LAKE WITH THE COVERAGE. RAMS WILL GET THE BALL TO START THE SECOND HALF. SEAN MAY BE THE FIRST COACH I'VE EVER SEEN IN RAIN LIKE THIS NOT TO WEAR A HAT. >> Kirk: BILL BELICHICK, WHO WAS IN THE NEWS TODAY. >> Al: YOU THINK? >> Kirk: THAT WAS A SHOCKER. >> Al: THIRD DOWN AND FOUR. PURDY FIRING. BROKEN UP. TRIED TO GET IT TO JENNINGS. LAKE IN ON THE PLAY. FOURTH AND FOUR. >> Kirk: REALLY GOOD JOB HERE OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE DEFENSIVE BACKS. DIDN'T SEE IT BUT A LITTLE SWITCH THERE WITH THE MOTION. GOOD JOB BACK-TO-BACK PLAYS BY LAKE. REALLY, I TELL YOU FOR A GUY THAT IS A SAFETY, SOMETIMES HE IS A CORNER, SOMETIMES HE IS AT NICKEL, HE DOES A GOOD JOB. A DIFFERENT AREA, THAT TIME HAD PLAY DOWN THE FIELD. GOOD JOB. >> Al: PRETTY GOOD BLOOD LINES. HIS FATHER CARNELL, A GREAT SAFETY BACK IN THE PITTSBURGH DAYS. XAVIER SMITH MAKES THE FAIR 50 DEGREES. RAINING OFF AND ON. RIGHT NOW, NOT MUCH. PRETTY GOOD. THE BEST IT'S BEEN IN 45 MINUTES OR SO. THE RAMS NOW HAVE TWO TIME-OUTS. 29 SECONDS. THEY TRY TO WORK IN TO FIELD GOAL RANGE. START HERE NACUA. PUKA WORKS HIS WAY UP TO THE 31. GREENLAW IS IN ON THAT TACKLE. THEY ARE LETTING THE CLOCK RUN DOWN HERE. >> Kirk: I THINK ON THAT LAST POSSESSION, TO GET THIS THING TIED UP, AS SLOPPY AS THIS FIRST HALF HAS BEEN, KIND OF REGROUP AND SEE WHERE THINGS GO IN THE SECOND HALF FOR COACHES. >> Al: DRY OFF AND MAYBE CHANGE THEIR SHOES. WE WILL SEE. IT IS THE END OF KIND OF A BIZARRE FIRST HALF, ININERS ARE DOING A GOOD JOB OF JUMPING THESE UNDERNEATH ROUTES. OFF OF PLAY ACTION, I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED TO SEE HEM TAKE A SHOT OR TWO EARLY HERE IN THE SECOND HALF TO TRY TO STRETCH THAT 49ers DEFENSE OUT. >> Al: THE RAMS WILL GET THE BALL. NACUA COMING OFF AN UNBELIEVABLE GAME AGAINST BUFFALO, ONE CATCH, EIGHT YARDS. KUPP, NO CATCHES. THIRD QUARTER IS UNDER WAY. IT'S A RETURNABLE KICK FROM THE 5 YARD LINE. JORDAN WHITTINGTON. GOOD COVERAGE HERE AND TAKE HIM DOWN TO THE 24. >> Kaylee: SEAN, YOU GET THE BALL AND HOPEFULLY THIS WEATHER HOLDS. HOW DO YOU GET YOUR PASSING GAME GOING? >> THE WEATHER A LITTLE BIT OF A THE BALL HAS BEEN SLICK. WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN MUCH GOING IN THE PASS GAME AND NOT STAY CONNECTED IN THE RUN GAME BUT A GREAT JOB BY JOSH KARTY TO KICK THE PHILADELPHIA. SEE IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING IN THE HALF. >> Kaylee: YOU HELD THE NINERS TO A FIELD GOAL. HOW DO YOU SUSTAIN THAT? >> GUYS ARE EFFICIENT EARLY ON THE DOWNS. I THINK THE WEATHER HAS BEEN A WE GOT TO GET STUFF GOING OFFENSIVELY AND SUSTAIN POSSESSION AND COME AWAY WITH POINTS. >> Al: THEY START ON THE GROUND. NACUA THREE CATCHES ON THE CORRECTION. KUPP WITH NONE. WILLIAMS IS THE WORK HORSE FOR LOS ANGELES ON THE GROUND. 15 CARRIES FOR 47 YARDS AND AVERAGING ABOUT 3 PER CARRY. IT'S AMAZING. YOU KNOW? YOU LOOK AT HIS BODY. THIS GUY IS A WORK HORSE. HE ACCOUNTS FOR 74% OF THE RAMS CARRIES THIS YEAR. THAT IS THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF ANY BACK IN THE NFL. YOU SEE IF THEY CAN GET HIM ON TRACK AGAIN. I THINK THE COMBINATION OF HIM AND THEN TAKING SOME SHOTS DOWN I DON'T MEAN JUST GO BALLS BUT THE DEEP CROSSERS AT 15, 20 YARDS, TOO. HERE HE IS AGAIN. OVER THE 1,000 YARD MARK LAST WEEK FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A >> Kirk: IF YOU'RE JUST TUNING IN AND YOU GOT TWO OF THE BETTER RECEIVERS AND STAFFORD. THEY COME IN ON FIRE. UNDERNEATH ROUTES HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY. TIGHT COVERAGE. STAFFORD LOOKING AWAY AND WORKING THROUGH HIS PROGRESSES AND EVENTUALLY COMING BACK. LINEBACKERS WITH GREAT COMMUNICATION WITH THE SAFETIES. WARD PLAYING THE BEST GAME WE HAVE SEEN HIM PLAY SINCE COMING BACK THE LAST THREE WEEKS. THE FIRST HALF YOU CHALK IT UP TO THE NINERS DEFENSE AND THEIR PREPARATION. >> Al: THIRD AND FIVE. SECONDARY CONTINUES TO DO ITS JOB AND JUST HAS TO FLIP IT INTO THE BENCH. YOU GOT ENOUGH PRESSURE ON HIM AND IT'S OUT OF THE POCKET BUT THAT SECONDARY, LIKE GLUE. >> Kirk: THAT JUST RUSHING FOUR AND WHAT THEY DID IN THE FIR IT'S NOT A BLITZ. YOU GOT SOME GREAT PASS RUSHERS. ONCE HE GETS OUT, YOU'RE PLAYING ZONE. IT'S JUST GREAT AWARENESS OF LOOKING AROUND. THAT IS PLASTER. YOU ALWAYS SEE DEFENSIVE COACHES SAY WE GOT TO PLASTER IF THE QUARTERBACK MOVES AROUND. THERE IS JUST NOWHERE TO GO FOR STAFFORD WHEN HE IS THROWING THE >> Al: EVANS IS AVERAGING 66 YARDS A PUNT. ANOTHER LINE DRIVE TAKEN TO THE 7 YARD LINE BY JACOB COWING. SO THE RAMS QUICKLY DONE AFTER THAT FIRST DRIVE. 46-YARD PUNT BY EVANS. SAN FRANCISCO WILL START THIS DRIVE FROM ITS OWN 37. >> Kirk: I DO THINK THAT THE NINERS ARE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT UNIT. THEY HAVE HAD SO MANY INJURIES. BUT DRE GREEN SHORTSTOP LAW BUT DRE GREEN SHORTLAW AND COMIN AND HUE FFANGA. >> Al: MAYBE WE WILL SEE JUSZCZYK MORE HERE ON THE GROUND GUERENDO PICKS UP EIGHT YARDS >> Kirk: NICE COMBINATION WITH BRENDEL AND BANKS 64 AND 65, CENTER AND LEFT GUARD, ESTABLISH THEY GET UP TO THE LINEBACKERS. JUSZCZYK GETS A NICE BLOCK. THAT IS FRAN 49ers OFFENSE RIGHT THERE, NO MATTER WHO THE RUNNING BACK IS. >> Al: JUSZCZYK IS IN MOTION AND SETS ON THE RIGHT. GUERENDO ON THE GROUND AND HE GETS TO THE 50 YARD LINE AND A FIRST DOWN FOR THE 49ers. >> Kirk: I THINK EVERYBODY OVER THE YEARS HAS MARVELLED AT THE SHANAHAN COACHES, YOU KNOW, MIKE AND KYLE AND THE BACKS THAT THEY HAVE HAD, YOU KNOW? VERY RARELY ARE THEY GETTING A GUY THAT IS THE GUY LIKE A CHRISTIAN McCAFFREY WHO THEY GOT THROUGH A TRADE WITH CAROLINA. YOU KNOW, IT'S GO THROUGH THE ALL THE WAY BACK TO TERRELL DAVIS AT DENVER. IT'S GUY THAT FITS THEIR SYSTEM. A GUY THAT HAS GOOD VISION. HE IS TOUGH. HE GETS INTO THE HOLE AND IS ABLE TO JUST FIT WITH WHAT THEY LIKE TO DO IN THIS OFFENSE. >> Al: STRAIGHT DROP. PASS OUT TO GUERENDO ON THE OUTSIDE. AND HE HAS A FIRST DOWN. DARIOUS WILLIAMS MAKES THE 49ers ON THE MOVE. >> Kirk: THAT IS WHERE HE IS MOST NATURAL JUST GOING BACK TO HIS DAYS OF A HIGH SCHOOL WIDE RECEIVER BEFORE HE MOVED WHEN HE WENT TO WISCONSIN TO RUNNING HE MADE A GREAT CATCH LAST WEEK AGAINST THE BEARS WHERE HE ADJUSTED BACK TO THE FOOTBALL TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA WHAT HE CAN DO WITH HIS HANDS, SO VERY NATURAL CATCHING THE FOOTBALL AND I THINK HE JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER WITH HIS FEEL OF HITTING THESE HOLES AND UNDERSTANDING, LIKE WE TALKED EARLIER IN THE SCHEME OF THE TIMING OF THE ZONE PLAY. >> Al: BACK IN TO SHOTGUN ON A DANCING. DEEBO SAMUEL WAS THE INTENDED RECEIVER. >> Kirk: I THINK BROCK PURDY WANTS TO GET THE BALL TO HIS GUYS SO BADLY THAT SOMETIMES WHEN YOU WANT IT SO BAD, SOMETIMES YOU START TO JUST AIM THE FOOTBALL. I MEAN, HE IS SUCH AN ACCURATE QUARTERBACK. THIS IS AN EASY THROW. THE BALL JUST KIND OF SAILED ON I MEAN, HE HAD TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THIS WEEK ABOUT, HEY, DID YOU HEAR WHAT DEEBO SAMUEL TWEETED CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? HE HAD ANSWER THAT A COUPLE TIMES. GUYS, LISTEN. NOBODY WANTS TO GIVE HIM THE BALL MORE THAN ME AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO DO THAT. >> Al: SECOND AND TEN. FIRES. CAUGHT. AND NINE-YARD GAIN HERE FOR TAKEN DOWN BY HOYT. THIRD AND ONE UPCOMING. >> Kirk: THIS OFFENSE, LIKE SO MANY, ARE BASED ON THE TIMING AND THE RHYTHM IN THE PASS GAME. HERE HE JUST GETS BACK, A HITCH. BALL OUT. PERFECTLY THROWN. THERE WAS NO HESITATION. FOUND HIS MAN. KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE ANSWER WAS BASED ON THE COVERAGE, SAW HOECHT WHO IS REALLY A BETTER PASS RUSHER THAN HE IS PLAYING OUT IN COVERAGE. GOOD JOB OF RECOGNIZING THAT PRESNAP AND GETTING THE BALL OUT THERE QUICKLY. >> Al: KITTLE HAS NOW CAUGHT THREE. PURDY, HIMSELF, PICKS UP THE >> Kirk: I LOVE THAT BECAUSE HE JUST DIDN'T HESITATE. HE SAW A GAP OVER THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CENTER AND HE DIDN'T TRY TO BAIT HIM OR TRY TO GET HIM TO JUMP. HE JUST SAW IT AND JUST TOOK OFF. HE IS A VERY ATHLETIC GUY. YOU AND I STANDING ON THE FIELD TALKING WITH HIM WITH KAYLEE BEFORE THE GAME. HE IS THICK. HIS LEGS AND HIS LOWER HALF AND HIS CORE ARE VERY THICK. >> Al: BETTER RUNNER THAN HE GETS CREDIT >> Kirk: YES. >> Al: HE HAD GREAT RUNS IN THE PLAYOFFS LAST YEAR. GUERENDO MADE THAT GRAB. >> Kirk: DISTINCT WHEN IT POWELL IT DOWN AND GO. ANOTHER NICE CATCH THERE BY A GOOD SHOT OF STAFFORD AND COOPER KUPP. THERE WILL BE NO PANIC IN THOSE VETERANS. THEY GOT TO FIND SOME ANSWERS AND, EVENTUALLY, JUST GOT TO GET THE FOOTBALL BACK AND SEE IF THEY CAN GET THIS OFFENSE GOING. I THOUGHT SEAN WAS RIGHT. LIKE INSTEAD OF WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE RAMS, IT'S NINERS ARE PLAYING PRETTY GOOD DEFENSE. SECOND DOWN AND EIGHT. TOSS BACK HERE. GUERENDO TRIES TO CUT IT BACK AND TAKEN DOWN. THERE IS HOECHT AGAIN. SPEIGHTS IS ALSO THERE. THE RUNNING GAME, HELPS TO HAVE A GREAT OFFENSIVE LINE COACH AS WELL. >> Kirk: YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT. REAL QUICK HERE ON HOECHT. THIS GUY IS -- WE TALKED ABOUT HIM BACK IN COVERAGE. THAT IS HIS GAME. EITHER RUSHING THE QUARTERBACK OR SETTING AN EDGE AND FIGHTING OFF A COUPLE OF BLOCKERS AND HE FORCES THAT BALL BACK TO THE INSIDE AND STILL GETS HIS HANDS ON AND HELPS MAKE THE TACKLE. GREAT PLAY THERE BY A GUY WHO HAS BECOME A MENTOR AND LEADER FOR THIS YOUNG DEFENSE. >> Al: PATRICK [ INAUDIBLE ] COMING INTO THE GAME. FLARE HIM OUT. THE PASS IS CAUGHT AND THEN DROPPED OVER THE MIDDLE! DEEBO SAMUEL WOULD HAVE HAD A FIRST DOWN AND MAYBE A TOUCHDOWN HAD HE CAUGHT IT. NOW THE CROWD, OF COURSE, IS RESPONDING TO THE FACT, GIMME THE BALL AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED. >> Kirk: WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S MAN COVERAGE. WELL DESIGNED. EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS. HE JUST STARTS TO LOOK AHEAD OF WHERE HE WANTS TO RUN WITH THE FOOTBALL BEFORE HE SECURES IT. I MEAN, IT'S MAN-TO-MAN. THERE IS A SAFETY IN THE MIDDLE BUT BROCK PURDY PUT IT IN FRONT OF HIM WHERE HE COULD RUN AFTER THE CATCH WHICH THE NINERS ARE LEGENDARY FOR AND HE DROPS THE >> Al: MOODY WITH A 47-YARDER TO GIVE THE 49ers THE LEAD AND JAKE MOODY IS ABLE TO BANG THAT ONE THROUGH. 8:23 REMAINING IN THE THIRD. SAMUEL DROPPED IT. HE MIGHT HAVE HAD SEVEN. INSTEAD, THEY GET THREE AND 49ers ARE UP 6-3 ON "THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL." MORNING. THAT IS WHERE HE REBUILT HIS CONFIDENCE. GUYS? >> Al: KIND OF A CRAZY SITUATION IN THE SUPER BOWL. LIKE, WHAT? EVEN KYLE SHANAHAN SAID THEY LOOKED OVER AND HE SAID, WHAT JUST HAPPENED? IT'S BEEN THAT LONG SINCE HE WAS ABLE TO GET INTO A GAME. TONIGHT, HE IS BACK IN THERE. THE RAMS WILL START THIS DRIVE AT THE 30 YARD LINE. >> Kirk: WE SEE THESE INJURIES ALL OVER THE NFL. I THINK THE MENTAL PART OF THAT -- YOU REALLY DON'T FULLY TEST THAT FAST TWITCH UNTIL THE FIRST TIME YOU GET OUT THERE ON THE FIELD. IT'S GREAT THAT IT'S HOLDING UP AS WELL AS IT IS HERE TONIGHT IN HIS FIRST GAME BACK. >> Al: HE HAS PLAYED VERY WELL. HE PLAYED A LOT AS HE HAS NOT BEEN ON A PITCH COUNT TONIGHT. THERE IS DEEBO SAMUEL JUST RELIVING THAT DROP. BLAKE CORUM IS THE BACK HERE. WILLIAMS HAS ALREADY CARRIED 16 TIMES SO CORUM IS GOING TO GET A SHOT. HE HAS TWO CARRIES FOR THREE. KUPP IS IN MOTION. STAFFORD RETREATS. UNDER PRESSURE, HE THROWS. THIS IS CORUM, THE ROOKIE OUT OF MICHIGAN, PICKING UP 12 AND A FIRST DOWN FOR LOS ANGELES. >> Kirk: I'M TELLING YOU, THIS GUY HAS THAT ABILITY. HE DROPPED A BALL EARLIER WHEN THE CONDITIONS WEREN'T THAT GREAT. BUT HE DID THIS THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER AT MICHIGAN. NOT ONLY A GREAT RUNNER, A VERY SIMILAR RUNNING STYLE AS WILLIAMS, BUT ALSO CAN CATCH THE BALL OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. NICE BLOCK BY PUKA ON FRED WARNER TO GET HIM -- SPRING HIM FREE AND PICK UP THOSE YARDS AFTER THE CATCH. >> Al: TWELVE-YARD GAIN AND LONGEST PLAY OF THE NIGHT FOR THE LOS ANGELES OFFENSE. STAFFORD TO THE OUTSIDE. THAT IS GOING TO BE TAKEN FOR ABOUT AN EIGHT-YARD GAME BY HUNTER LONG, TIGHT END, THE MAN WHO RETURNED A BLOCKED PUNT FOR A TOUCHDOWN LAST SUNDAY. >> Kirk: WITH THESE LINEBACKERS AND CORNERS DROPPING AND SINKING IN COVERAGE, SAFETIES ARE PHYSICALLY TURNING THEIR BODY AND WAITING FOR -- IN BREAKING ROUTES THE ANSWER BY SEAN McVAY IS TO GET THE BALL OUT TO THE FLAT THERE, ABOUT A BACK OR A TIGHT END. GET THE BALL OUT THERE QUICKLY. >> Al: PICK UP THE PACE AND GOING NO-HUDDLE HERE. >> Kirk: SECOND ONE. >> Al: YEP. CORUM FIGHTS HIS WAY FOR A FIRST THAT IS LENOIR MAKING THAT THE CLOCK TICKS DOWN TO 7:00. RAMS ARE TRYING TO PICK UP THE PACE HERE. AGAIN, THERE IS A LOOK AT LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. WHAT A DIFFERENCE AS PART OF IT. I LOVED WHAT HE SAID TO KAYLEE WHEN HE SAID THIS IS JUST ONE OF THOSE GAMES. WHEN YOU SAY THAT, THAT MEANS YOU GOT TO FIND A WAY TO WIN A DIVISIONAL MATCHUP AS SLOPPY AND AS UGLY AS IT MIGHT BE. YOU GOT TO FIND A WAY. REMEMBER, THEY ARE PLAYING FOR A CHANCE TO WIN THE LAST FOUR AND WIN THIS DIVISION. >> Al: THE UGLY WINS COUNT AS MUCH AS GORGEOUS WINS. >> Kirk: THAT'S RIGHT. >> Al: STAFFORD FIRING IN TO TRAFFIC. TIPPED AND INCOMPLETE. HE TRIED TO GET IT TO COLBY PARKINSON. FIRST TIME HE IS TARGETED WARD AND HUFANGA BRACKETED HIM >> Kirk: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TAG THE SHOTS IN THE FLAT. OH, THEY IT WILL GO IT OUT OF THE FLAT AND WE GOT TO TAKE THAT AWAY. TIMED UP PRETTY WELL BUT LOOK AT ALL OF THE DEFENSIVE BACKS READY FOR THAT SHOT DOWN FIELD DOWN THAT SIDELINE. WARD IS THERE. HUE HUFANGA IS THERE. THEY TOOK ALL OPTIONS AWAY FROM STAFFORD ON THAT ROUTE. >> Al: THEY KNOW THAT RAMS PLAYBOOK PRETTY WELL. >> Kirk: THEY ARE DIALED IN SECOND DOWN AND TEN. CORUM. SHORT GAIN. SO IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND SEVEN NOW FOR THE RAMS. 6:20 TO GO IN THE THIRD. >> Kirk: THE THING THAT HAS BEEN MOST IMPRESSIVE TO ME IS HOW THIS 49ers DEFENSIVE LINE THAT IS USUALLY WHEN YOU THINK OF THE NINERS DEFENSE NINERS DEFENSIVE LINE YOU THINK OF THE ABILITY TO RUSH THE BUT BOSA BEING BACK HAS GIVEN THEM SOME TOUGHNESS ON THE EDGE. LEONARD FLOYD ON THE OTHER SIDE IS DOING A GREAT JOB. THE INTERIOR IS HODLE THE INTERIOR IS HODLDING UP AGAINST THIS PHYSICAL RAMS OFFENSIVE LINE AND RUN GAME. >> Al: WILLIAMS IS BACK IN BUT HE IS A RECEIVER IN THIS SET. NACUA COMES IN MOTION. STAFFORD SLIDING LEFT. NACUA REACHES UP AND IN. A LITTLE BIT SHORT OF THE FIRST. HIT BY JI'AYIR BROWN. >> Kirk: WHAT A JOB BY STAFFORD AND NACUA WHO GOES IN TO MOTION AND GETS MATCHED UP AGAINST LENOIR AND IS ABLE TO SEPARATE BUT HE KNOWS HE'S IN TRAFFIC. THAT'S A BIG HIT THERE BY THE SAFETY BROWN BUT, AGAIN, HE SHOWS THAT TOUGHNESS AND STRENGTH TO HOLD ON TO IT. >> Al: HE SNATCHED IT OUT OF THE AIR. >> Al: WILLIAMS IS THE FOURTH AND ONE. KEEPER. A FIRST DOWN. STAFFORD TAKES IT HIMSELF. HE MOVES THE BALL TO THE 35 YARD >> Kirk: WE WERE TALKING TO HIM THIS WEEK AND SAYING, DUDE, YOU LOOK LIKE THE BEST YOU'VE LOOKED IN YOUR CAREER AS FAST AS YOUR BODY. THERE IS BOSA LIMPING OFF THE HE GOES OVER THAT RIGHT LEG OF 50, LIMMER, THE CENTER. PLENTY OF ROOM TO PICK UP THE HE TALKED ABOUT HOW MAXX CROSBY AND SOMETHING HE LIVES YEAR-ROUND AND TAKES CARE OF HIS BODY LIKE SO MANY GUYS IN THEIR 30s WITH DIET AND EXERCISE. THE GUY COMES OUT AND WORKS ON HIS BODY TO KEEP HIM FEELING GOOD AS OFTEN AS HE CAN. >> Al: HE HAS TAKEN EVERY SNAP THIS SEASON. IN HIS 16th YEAR IN THE LEAGUE. FIGHTING HIS WAY FOR A FIVE YARD GAIN IS KYREN WILLIAMS WHO WAS NOMINATED. HE IS THE RAMS NOMINEE FOR MAN OF THE YEAR. OUTSTANDING YOUNG MAN. I WATCHED HIM GROW UP AND CALLED ONE OF HIS FIRST FEW GAMES THAT HE WAS IN SOUTH BEND AT NOTRE DAME. WHAT IS GREAT ABOUT BLAKE CORUM GETTING MORE CARRIES AND BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THIS RAMS OFFENSE IS HE IS GETTING MORE TAKES SOME OF THE HEAT OFF OF KYREN WILLIAMS AND MAYBE IT EVENTUALLY GOES TO 70, 60, 30, 40, WHERE THEY ARE BOTH GETTING THEIR CHANCES. >> Al: INSTEAD OF 29 CARRIES IN THE BUFFALO GAME. HE HAS 17 CARRIES TONIGHT. >> Kirk: RIGHT. >> Al: SECOND AND FIVE. FLAGS. FOUR. OFFENSE, NUMBER 79. >> Al: ROB HAVENSTEIN, THE LAST OF THE ST. LOUIS RAMS WHO WAS WITH THEM IN ST. LOUIS IN 2015 YEAR BEFORE THEY MOVED TO L.A. >> Kirk: BOSA WENT OFF THE FIELD AND NOW BACK ON THE FIELD HERE. ALSO DRE GREENLAW WENT OFF THE FIELD A FEW SNAPS AGO, SO WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON HIM AS WELL. REMEMBER, I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S ON A PITCH COUNT TONIGHT. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HE IS IN ANY KIND OF PAIN BUT HE IS NOT ON THE FIELD CURRENTLY. >> Al: HE TOLD KYLE, I WANT TO PLAY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. >> Al: THAT IS MY QUARTER. PASS CAUGHT. NACUA PROBING, YARDS AFTER CONTACT. HE DOES IT ALL. TO THE 21 YARD LINE GOES PUKA. >> Kirk: HE IS A TOUGH GUY. AGAIN, ANY RECEIVER THAT IS GOING TO COME UNDERNEATH LIKE THIS, ESPECIALLY ON A QUICK THROW. I MEAN, THAT IS NO MAN'S LANDS. SAFETIES. LOOK AT THE BLOCKERS DOWN FIELD. GREAT JOB BY THE RIGHT GUARD DOTSON GETTING DOWN THE FIELD. THAT IS NO MAN'S LAND. YOU COULD TAKE A FOREARM ON THE CHEST VERY EASILY FROM FRED WARNER OR A SAFETY. NICE DRIVE HERE BY THE RAMS, AL. >> Al: NACUA COMES OUT FOR A PLAY AND HE'S ON THE SIDELINE. FIRST AND TEN. 2:40 TO GO IN THE QUARTER. HE CAN MOVE THAT PILE. TO THE 18 YARD LINE HE GOES. SECOND AND SIX AFTER A GAIN OF >> Kirk: THIS IS THEIR FIRST RED ZONE TRIP OF THE YEAR. IF YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE WAY THE RAMS SEASON HAS GONE, IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO THE GAMES THAT THEY ARE WINNING. THEY ARE SCORING TOUCHDOWNS DOWN IN THE GAMES THEY HAVE LOST, MANY CASES, THEY HAVE HAD TO SETTLE FOR FIELD GOALS. IN A GAME LIKE THIS, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MORE OPPORTUNITIES YOU'RE GOING TO GET. >> Al: SECOND AND SIX. WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE RED ZONE IS INSIDE THE 20 YARD LINE. 49ers, I THINK, HAVE GIVEN UP 13 CONSECUTIVE TOUCHDOWNS ON OPPONENT'S RED ZONE DRIVES. >> Kirk: IT'S NOT BEEN PRETTY ALL YEAR FOR THEM BUT THEY GOT THEM TO THIRD DOWN. >> Al: THERE IT IS. LONGEST STREAK SINCE THE COVID >> Kirk: NACUA HAS BEEN THE WEAPON, NOT JUST TONIGHT BUT SINCE HE HAS BEEN BACK HEALTHY. >> Al: SO A BIG THIRD AND FIVE. THEY GIVE IT TO WILLIAMS AND HE GETS THE FIRST DOWN. KYREN WILLIAMS TO THE 11 YARD >> Kirk: WHAT A CALL. REALLY GOOD CALL. DAVIS ALLEN, THE ONLY TIGHT END SEAN McVAY SPREADS THE DEFENSE OUT WITH RECEIVERS. NO TIGHT END IN THE END LINE. THAT WAS THE KEY BLOCK RIGHT THERE. AVILA, THE LEFT GUARD, A NICE JOB THERE OF KICKING OUT COLLINS. I THINK NINERS WERE SURPRISED WITH THAT CALL. SEAN McVAY WITH A HECK OF A CALL THERE TO JUST SPRING HIM LOOSE. >> Al: FINAL MINUTE OF THE PERIOD. WILLIAMS, AGAIN. YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK AT ACE NUMBERS AND NOT THAT IMPRESSIVE 21 CARRIES AND 72 YARDS. YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE GAME TO R0I6 THE VALUE OF THIS GUY. >> Kirk: I'M RIGHT THERE WITH YOU. WE TALKED AT HALFTIME WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO? WE SAID HE WOULD BE STUSH BBORN WORK THE RUN GAME. 14th PLAY ON THIS DRIVE RIGHT >> Al: THE DRIVE IS OVER 8:00 LONG. AND THEY WILL NOT GET A PLAY THEY WILL CHANGE ENDS TO THE FOURTH WE GO AND SAN >> Al: SEATTLE IS 8-5. TOUGH ONE FOR THEM AT HOME AGAINST GREEN BAY COMING UP SUNDAY NIGHT. RAMS 7-6. ARIZONA THREE LOSSES IN A ROW AND 6-7. THE 49ers TRYING TO HANG IN THERE TO GET TO .500. MEANWHILE, THIS IS THE 14th PLAY OF A DRIVE THAT HAS CONSUMED 8:23. IT'S A SECOND AND THREE FROM THE 4. STAFFORD IS GOING TO GET AROUND THE CORNER? NO. HE IS PUNCHED UP AT THE 1 YARD GOT A FLAG ON THE PLAY. FRED WARNER IS THERE. THE 49ers CLAPPING, OBVIOUSLY, TELLING YOU WHO THE PENALTY AGAINST. NUMBER 87. >> Al: ON DAVIS ALLEN. >> Kirk: THE TIGHT END DAVIS ALLEN IS TRYING TO MAKE A BLOCK ON THE CORNER YIADOM. THERE IS THE GRAB. HOW ABOUT THE CALL? LAST GUY IN THE WORLD YOU THINK IS GOING TO CARRY IT DOWN THERE IS STAFFORD. >> Al: WELL, YEAH. HE HAS IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS HE HAS ONE RUSHING TOUCHDOWN. >> Kirk: LOOK AT THAT. 152 MEETINGS? >> Kirk: FIRST TIME. >> Al: ALL THE WAY BACK TO 1950. RAMS IN THE NFL AT THAT POINT AND 49ers COMING OUT OF THE OLD ALL-AMERICA FOOTBALL CONFERENCE. SECOND DOWN AND 11. >> Kirk: A HUGE PLAY. WITHOUT THAT HOLD, THE BALL IS DOWN TO THE 1 YARD LINE. >> Al: THREE RECEIVERS OFF TO THE LEFT. STAFFORD THROWS ON THE RUN. NACUA MAKES THE CATCH AT THE 5 >> Kirk: AGAIN, WE SAW STAFFORD USE HIS LEGS LAST WEEK IN CRITICAL MOMENTS AGAINST THE BILLS AND THROWING THE BALL WELL ON THE RUN. HERE, WE ARE AT THAT MOMENT. SEAN McVAY SAYING THE CRITICAL AREAS MAKE A DIFFERENCE. HOW WE DO ON THIRD DOWN AND HOW WE DO ON THE RED ZONE. ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SCORE? THESE ARE THOSE MOMENTS AND TALKING ABOUT HIS TEAM BEING RESILIENT. SO MUCH AT STAKE. THEY GOT TO CAPITALIZE HERE. >> Al: STAFFORD UNDER PRESSURE. AVOIDS THE SACK. ON THE MOVE. LEG IS DOWN. THROW IS TIPPED. SO THAT WAS A THIRD AND FOUR. AGAINST THE RAMS. >> Kirk: RIGHT TACKLE AGAINST BOSA. AS GOOD AS HAVENSTEIN IS, WHEN BOSA IS HEALTHY AND RUSHING A QUARTERBACK THE WAY HE IS TONIGHT, THAT IS A TOUGH ASK. YOU SEE THAT RIGHT ARM GET UP AROUND THE NECK RIG >> Referee: TWO FOULS ON THE PLAY AND BOTH BY THE OFFENSE. BOTH FOULS WILL BE DECLINED. HE INELIGIBLE MAN DOWN THE FIELD, NUMBER 65. HOLDING, NUMBER 79. AGAIN, THEY ARE BOTH DECLINED. IT'S FOURTH DOWN. >> Al: KYLE DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE THEM ANOTHER SHOT. HE WOULD RATHER TAKE HIS CHANCE AND WORRY ABOUT A 6-6 TIE AND BREAKING A TIE HERE INSTEAD OF GIVING UP THE TD. KARTY COMES IN. HE HAD ONE EARLIER FROM 48. THIS ONE IS FROM 23. ETHAN EVANS TO PUT IT DOWN. A PAIR OF SIX'S. STAFFORD TOOK A SHOT DURING THAT LONG DRIVE. 17 PLAYS FOR 65 YARDS. THERE IS THAT SHOT. MADDEN NFL. WATCH THE SERIES NOW. RAMS KICKING OFF HERE. LINE DRIVE KICK AND IT JUST DOES GO INTO THE END ZONE. OTHERWISE, IT WOULD HAVE COME OUT TO THE 40. TO THE 30 THEY GO. SAN FRANCISCO BALL. >> Kirk: LET'S LOOK AT OUR NEXT GENSTATS. KOBIE TURNER 20 PRESSURES THIS SEASON AND MOST IN THE NFL WHILE DOUBLE TEAMED. TONIGHT HE HAS BEEN DOUBLE TEAMED AND ESPECIALLY IN THE FOUR PRESSURES AND A SACKS. NOT BAD. AND THAT IS THE MOST IN THE ENTIRE NFL IN A FIRST HALF THIS HE WILL HAVE TO HAVE A BIG IMPACT FOR THIS RAMS DEFENSE TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO HARASS BROCK PURDY WHEN HE IS BACK THERE THROWING THE FOOTBALL. THERE IS A LITTLE FRUSTRATION ON STAFFORD'S PART. TURNER, SECOND YEAR GUY OUT OF WAKE FOREST. CAUGHT HERE BY SAMUEL. A GAIN OF FIVE. AND A PENALTY. KITTLE INDICATES IT'S HIM. INELIGIBLE PLAYER DOWN THE PENALTY IS DECLINED. PASS INTERFERENCE, NUMBER 85. >> Al: THERE IS THE BIGGER ONE. >> Kirk: IT'S A RARE MISTAKE BY KITTLE, ESPECIALLY IN A FOURTH QUARTER GAME IN A 6-6 FOOTBALL HE IS JUST TRYING TO WORK LATE HE DOES A GOOD JOB THERE. THE INITIAL CONTACT, HE GRABBED AHOLD OF HIM AND GOT A HOLD OF THAT JERSEY. >> Al: AND HE KNEW IT. FIRST AND 20. FOUR-MAN RUSH. HE CAME IN FROM THE LEFT SIDE. HE HAD QUENTIN LAKE WHO WAS JUST INVOLVED IN THE LAST PLAY BLITZING FROM THE SECONDARY. SECOND DOWN AND 20. >> Kirk: YOU HAVEN'T SEEN A TON OF THAT BUT WHEN THEY HAVE BROUGHT A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE, IT HAS BEEN FROM THE EDGE AT 37 FROM THE TOP THERE. HE IS ABLE TO GET FREE. HE GETS HIS HANDS UP. LOOK AT OUR DEFENSIVE ALERTS. ANY TIME YOU SEE THEE DEFENSIVE ALERTS, IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHO IS GOING TO CO POTENTIAL THREAT. THEY WERE ALL OVER IT LAST TIME. >> Al: THE PASS IS DEEP DOWN THE INTENDED FOR SAMUEL. IT IS BUSTED UP BY KAM KINCHENS. >> Kirk: SAMUEL IS RIGHT HERE. WATCH THE COVERAGE ON THE BACK END. THE BALL HANGS IN THE AIR SO LONG THAT THE CORNER HERE DOES A GOOD JOB OF READING IT AND HE'S IN GOOD POSITION AND HE IS ABLE TO GET UNDERNEATH THAT AND KINCHENS ALMOST COMES U THAT INTERCEPTION. HE IS A GOOD JOB AS A ROOKIE OUT OF MIAMI PLAYING CENTER AND COMING UP WITH SOME PICK >> Al: VERY GOOD. DRAW PLAY HERE. NEEDED 20 AND GOT 16 WITH GUERENDO TAKING IT UP TO THE BULL THE PUNT TEAM COMES IN ON >> Kirk: SO THAT OFFENSIVE PASS INTERFERENCE REALLY IMPACTS THIS DRIVE AND GETS THEM WAY BEHIND THE STICKS, SO THE RAMS GET THE FOOTBALL BACK HERE. >> Al: PUNT NUMBER SEVEN FOR PAT O'DONNELL, AVERAGING 45 YARDS PER BOOT. WE GOT A FLAG. FLAG AT THE INTERCEPTION OF THE PLAY AND FAIR CAUGHT AT THE MOMENT AT THE 29 YARD LINE. SO THAT WAS A PUNT OF 46 YARDS. AND WE WILL SEE WHAT MR. MARTIN TELLS US AS HE IS LOOKING OVER TO THE RAMS BENCH AS IF HOW DO YOU WANT TO -- >> Referee: ILLEGAL FORMATION, SAN FRANCISCO, NUMBER 45 WAS LINED UP IN THE BACKFIELD. FIVE-YARD PENALTY FROM THE END OF THE PLAY. >> Al: THAT IS WHAT THEY HAVEN MAX. DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO IS ABOUT 44 MILES UP THE 101. >> Kirk: TELL ME YOU LIKED "ELF." >> Al: BEST MOVIE I EVER SAW ALONG WITH "GONE WITH THE WIND." STAFFORD GOING DEEP DOWN THE HE HAS NACUA, TO THE 16 YARD LINE! PUKA NACUA GOT FREE AND BIGGEST PLAY OF THE NIGHT. >> Kirk: THERE IT IS. WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THESE SHOTS DOWN FIELD AND THEY FINALLY PICKED THE RIGHT TIME. A LITTLE PLAY SACTION AND CATCH THEM IN A BLITZ ONE-ON-ONE. BOY, DOES HE GET BEHIND WARD. IT'S BEEN SUCH TIGHT COVERAGE ON THE BACK END WITH THESE 49ers AND CORNERS AND THE SAFETIES DIALING UP ANY KIND OF CROSSERS BUT THIS TIME, THEY TAKE HIM DOWN THE FIELD BEHIND THE SAFETIES AND THEY HIT A BIG ONE. >> Al: 51 YARDS. RAMS NOW AT THE 16. WILLIAMS FIGHTING HIS WAY INSIDE THE 10. GIPSON MAKES THAT TACKLE. SECOND AND TWO. >> Kirk: REALLY GOOD BLOCK BY PARKINSON, THE TIGHT END ON THE RIGHT SIDE. 49ers AFTER 13 STRAIGHT TOUCHDOWNS THAT YOU REFERRED TO IN THE RED ZONE AREA, THE LAST TIME WE SAW, THE LAST TIME THEY STOPPED THEM AND FORCED THEM TO KICK A FIELD GOAL. THERE IS A LOOK AT GREENLAW. >> Al: STILL ON THE BENCH. WILLIAMS HAS CARRIED 22 TIMES MAKE IT 23. THIS TIME, HE IS WRESTLED DOWN BY TASHAUN GIPSON. >> Kaylee: DE GREENLAW HAS BEEN TAKING DEEP BREATHS WHILE ON THE SIDELINE ALL OF THIS TIME AND IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL IF HE IS BREATHING THROUGH PAIN OR TRYING TO CATCH HIS BREATH. WHEN THAT DEFENSE GOT ON THE FIELD HE DIDN'T MOVE AS IF TO GRAB HIS HELMET. HE IS SITTING TIGHT AND EVERYBODY IS CHECKING ON HIM AND HE IS OKAY. >> Al: THERE HE IS. BUT NOT OKAY READY IT RESUME ACTION ON THIRD AND TWO WITH PLAY CLOCK AT 1. STRAIGHT DROP. CHASED. THROWS. CAUGHT BUT SECURED. SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN. FRED WARNER MAKES THAT TACKLE. THE RAMS HAD SECOND AND TWO AND NOW IT'S A FOURTH AND TWO. >> Kirk: KYREN WILLIAMS HAS AS MUCH RESPECT FOR WHAT HE DOES WITHOUT THE FOOTBALL AS WHAT HE DOES WITH THE BALL. HERE HE IS RIGHT HERE. HE PICKS UP FLOYD RIGHT THERE. HE PUTS HIM ON HIS BACK AND THEN LEAKS OUT FOR THAT CHECKDOWN AND HE ENDS UP CATCHING THE I THINK THIS IS WHY HIS TEAM LOVES HIM. IT'S NOT JUST THE WAY HE RUNS THE BALL. GOOD JOB ON THAT BLITZ PICK. >> Al: JOSH KARTY IS OUT TO GIVE THEM THE LEAD WITH A 27-YARD ATTEMPT. OPERATION PERFECT. KICK, PERFECT. 9:30 TO GO IN REGU TIME NOW FOR THE GAME." PRESENTED BY PEPSI. REMEMBER ALL OF THE TALK THIS WEEK ABOUT DEEBO SAMUEL WANTS TO GET THE BALL MORE AND THEY ARE TRYING TO GET HIM THE FOOTBALL MORE. IT HAS BEEN A TOUGH NIGHT AS FAR AS OPPORTUNITIES. THEY HAVE HANDED THE FOOTBALL TO HERE, THEY THROW HIM THE BALL. IF HE CATCHES THAT, IT'S POTENTIALLY A TOUCHDOWN AGAINST MAN COVERAGE. SEVEN TARGETS AND JUST THREE RECEPTIONS AND 16 YARDS. HE HAS ALSO CARRIED IT A COUPLE TIMES FOR THREE MORE YARDS. SO 19 YARDS. >> Al: RUN THIS ONE BACK FROM A COUPLE OF YARDS IN THE END ZONE AND THERE IS NUMBER 1, SAMUEL, HE GETS A TOUCH. WASN'T GOING TO PASS UP AN OPPORTUNITY, EVEN THOUGH THE KICK WAS IN THE END ZONE. >> Al: MEANWHILE, THE DIVISION PLAYOFF PICTURE RIGHT NOW WITH THE DIVISION LEADERS UP THERE, THE WILDCARDS WOULD BE MINNESOTA, GREEN BAY, AND WASHINGTON. RAMS, OF COURSE, VERY MUCH IN THE HUNT. FALCONS ARE, TOO. CARDINALS ARE AS WELL. AND FOR THE 49ers, AS WE MENTIONED AT THE TOP OF THE GAME TONIGHT, MAN, THIS IS ALMOST LIKE UNDER YOU'RE ON LIFE SUPPORT IF YOU DON'T WIN THIS >> Kirk: IT'S DESPERATION TIME. >> Al: FROM THE 28 YARD LINE. GUERENDO AND TAKEN OUT OF BOUNDS AFTER A VERY MINIMAL GAIN BY QUENTIN LAKE. >> Kirk: YOU LOOK AT THE STANDINGS IN DECEMBER AND I THINK MATTHEW STAFFORD FEELS IT'S DESPERATION TIME. A GAME BACK BEHIND SEATTLE IN THEIR DIVISION. THEY LOOK WHO THEY HAVE TO PLAY TONIGHT AND LOOK AT THE REST OF THE YEAR. THEY GOT SEATTLE AT THE END OF SO STILL IN A SPOT TO BE ABLE TO WIN THIS DIVISION BUT THEY HAVE GOT TO WIN TONIGHT. SAN FRAN IS AT MIAMI AND THEN DETROIT COMES IN HERE AND THEY FINISH AT ARIZONA. JUSZCZYK IN MOTION. PURDY STEPS UP. STEPS AWAY. CATCH IS MADE. THAT WAS RICKY PEARSALL MAKING THE GRAB. PEARSALL IS THE KID, THE NUMBER ONE DRAFT CHOICE. HE WAS SHOT IN A ROBBERY IN SAN FRANCISCO IN THE SUMMERTIME. HE SPENT SIX WEEKS OUT. HE HAS COME BACK STRONG. >> Kirk: WATCH PURDY HAS TO WORK AND FEEL IN THE POCKET. STEP AWAY. AS HE IS FALLING BACK, HE IS ABLE TO KEEP HIS EYES DOWN THE FIELD AND MAKE AN ACCURATE THROW TO PEARSALL. REALLY GOOD FEEL IN THE POCKET THAT TIME BY BROCK PURDY. >> Al: NUMBER ONE PICK, THE ROOKIE OUT OF FLORIDA. GUERENDO ABOUT TWO AND A HALF TO STOPPED THERE. UNDER 8:00 NOW TO PLAY IN REGULATION. >> Kirk: PRETTY AMAZING WHEN WE JUST TALKED ABOUT WITH DEEBO SAMUEL. WE TALKED ABOUT HIM BEING VOCAL AND WANTING THE BALL MORE. IT'S BEEN FOUR STRAIGHT GAMES. THIS WILL BE THE FIFTH GAME. THERE IS KOBII TURNER. A IMPORTANT PART OF THE DEFENSE. FIFTH STRAIGHT GAME HE HAS BEEN HELD UNDER 40 YARDS FROM YOU NEVER THINK THAT WHEN YOU THINK OF DEEBO SAMUEL. ESPECIALLY WHEN McCAFFREY AND AIYUK ARE DOWN. THAT IS ONE OF YOUR GUIYS, RIGHT >> Al: VERY IMPORTANT. CATCH MADE HERE AND FIRST DOWN AND HOG TIED TO THE GROUND IS GEORGE KITTLE. >> Kirk: WHETHER IT'S MAN COVERAGE OR ZONE, YOU CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON KITTLE BEING ABLE TO WIN AND ABLE TO SEPARATE AGAINST MAN. THIS TIME, IT'S ZONE SO HE GETS BETWEEN THOSE TWO LINEBACKERS AND THE TIMING WITH BROCK PURDY. HE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE THAT BALL NEEDED TO BE THROWN, RIGHT BETWEEN THE TWO INSIDE LINEBACKERS. GOOD THROW. ACCURATE THROW. GIVES KITTLE A CHANCE. >> Al: KITTLE HAS CAUGHT FOUR FOR 61 YARDS. HE HAS BEEN THEIR TOP RECEIVER. FIRST DOWN FROM THE 43. PURDY GOING DEEP! PEERSALL WAS THE INTENDED RECEIVER AND WITHERSPOON GETTING TO PLAY TONIGHT BECAUSE COBIE DURANT IS HURT. >> Kirk: PEARSALL CAN GET DOWN THE FIELD IN A HURRY AND HE IS STEPPING IN FOR DURANT. MAYBE A LITTLE BIT LATE BECAUSE PEARSALL GOT THE SEAM. HE HAD A CHANCE. THERE IS THE LENGTH OF WITHERSPOON TO KNOCK THAT FOOTBALL AWAY BUT PEARSALL HAD TO SLOW DOWN AND COME BACK TO THAT FOOTBALL. >> Al: WITHERSPOON ACTIVATED FROM THE PRACTICE SQUAD. GUERENDO HAS A HOLE THROUGH THE MIDDLE AND TRY TO BACK HIS WAY TO THE LINE TO GAIN AND MAY HAVE DONE THAT. WE WILL SEE WHERE THEY SPOT IT BUT A SECOND AND TEN. HE COMES UP A LITTLE BIT SHORT. >> Kirk: THE 49ers OFFICERS LINE CAN BE PHYSICAL AND LEAN ON YOU. THE ROOKIE RIGHT GUARD PUNI WITH AN AMAZING BLOCK. YOU'LL SEE HIM BACK HERE. DRIVING JOHNSON AND OPENING THAT HOLE UP. >> Al: THEY GIVE THEM A FIRST DOWN AS THEY SPOT THE BALL. NOW TAKE A LOOK AT THE CHAINS. >> Kirk: 68 McKIVITZ MAKES A NICE BLOCK. SOMETHING ABOUT YOU PUT A GUY IN A SAN FRANCISCO 49ers JERSEY AND YOU PUT HIM IN THAT TAILBACK SPOT AND HE IS GOING TO BE PRODUCTIVE. >> Al: JUSZCZYK IS THE FULLBACK LEADING THE WAY BUT NOTHING SO GUERENDO -- THE QUESTION AS OF 24 HOURS AGO IS WOULD HE HE HAS CARRIED 16 TIMES FOR 55 ESPECIALLY ON A SHORT WEEK. I THINK THEY FELT IF IT WAS A FULL WEEK, HE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD ANY PROBLEM. THEY REALLY DIDN'T KNOW, LIKE YOU SAY, AL, UNTIL THEY CAME OUT HERE TONIGHT. I THINK THEY THOUGHT SAMUEL MIGHT HAVE TO HAVE A FEW MORE CARRIES AND HE HAS UP TO THIS POINT RUNNING THE BALL. I THINK HE'S HAD A COUPLE OF CARRIES. >> Al: KOBIE TURNER IS BACK IN ALONG THAT DEFENSIVE FRONT. SECOND AND 11. 5:30 LEFT IN THE FOURTH. TAYLOR IS THE RUNNING BACK. PURDY GOING FOR IT ALL! AND IT'S GOING TO BE PICKED OFF IN THE END ZONE! DARIOUS WILLIAMS ON AN OVERTHROW. AND THE RAMS GET THE TAKEAWAY. 5:14 LEFT AFTER THE PICK. 9-6 RAMS. >> Kirk: GO BACK AND LOOK AT THIS PLAY WITH PEARSALL ON THE LEFT. HE GETS A LITTLE CONFUSED AND JUMPS BACK. LOOK AT THE RAMS DEFENSE REACT TO THIS. LAKE HERE AND THEY PLAY COVER SO REALLY GOOD JOB THERE BY HE IS NOT GOING TO LET THAT LITTLE STUTTER AND GO EFFECT THE REASON THE BALL IS UNDERTHROWN A BIT IS THE PRESSURE BY FISKE AND NUMBER 91 KOBIE TURNER AND NOT BEING FOOLED BY JAUAN JENNINGS WITH THAT STUTTER AND GO AND HE COMES UP WITH A HUGE PICK THERE THE RAMS. >> Al: DARIOUS WILLIAMS, SEVEN YEARS IN THE LEAGUE, MAKES A BIG PLAY HERE AND GIVES THE RAMS THE BALL WITH 5:14. STAFFORD THROWS. IT MAY HAVE BEEN TIPPED. ATWELL IS THERE. TUTU ATWELL HAULS IT IN WITH A GAIN OF SIX. >> Kirk: OFF THE EDGE AND 45 KNOCKED THAT BALL DOWN ON THE EDGE IS FLANNIGAN FOWLES. HE KNOCKS IT DOWN. TUTU ATWELL, WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM MUCH TONIGHT. NOT ONLY POSITIVE YARDS, BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY, HE KEEPS THAT BUFFALO HAS SEEN ENOUGH OF HIM. HE MADE THAT PLAY LAST WEEK. SECOND DOWN AND FOUR. ROLLING. THAT WILL MOVE THE STICKS. HUNTER LONG MAKES THE CATCH FOR >> Kirk: HOW ABOUT THE CALLS HERE BY SEAN McVAY? COME UP WITH A BIG INTERCEPTION. YOU'RE IN THAT FOUR-MINUTE OFFENSE, MEANING YOU NEED TO WORK THE CLOCK AND RUN THE INSTEAD, THE FIRST TWO PLAYS, A QUICK THROW OUT TO THE RIGHT THAT ATWELL ADJUSTS TO AND COME THEY ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO RUN THE BALL HERE ON THIS -- NO. BOOT. GET STAFFORD AWAY FROM THE PRESSURE AND YOU GET A NEW SET OF DOWNS. >> Al: WILLIAMS EXPLOITS THAT HOLE AND FORWARD PROGRESS. FRED WARNER MAKING THE TACKLE. THEY WILL SPOT IT A LITTLE BIT SHORT. >> Kirk: THIS IS A DIFFERENT DEFENSE TONIGHT WITHOUT DRE GREENLAW IN THE MIDDLE. WE KNOW HOW GREAT THIS GUY IS, FRED WARNER. BUT WITHOUT HIS SIDE KICK, IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE THAT SAME FEEL RAMS ABLE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL THEY CONTROL THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND GET KYREN WILLIAMS WHO RUNS PHYSICALLY AND TOUGH AND GET HIM RUNNING DOWNHILL. >> Al: SECOND AND ONE. STAFFORD KEEPS IT HIMSELF AND HE HAS THE FIRST DOWN. THAT CLOCK KEEPS ON RUNNING 49ers HAVE ALL OF THEIR TIME-OUTS. YOU ALSO HAVE THE TWO MINUTE WASHING, SO A TON OF TIME, BUT YOU NEED TO STOP THEM. >> Kirk: THINK ABOUT THIS RAMS ALL OF THE INJURIES. YOU GOT A VETERAN QUARTERBACK. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT -- YOU AND I HAD THEM EARLIER IN THE YEAR AGAINST THE VIKINGS AND MAYBE MOVE HIM AND COOPER KUPP. WE TALKED ABOUT THAT EARLIER. AFTER STARTING 1-4, THEY HAVE WON 6 OF THEIR LAST 8 AND NOW ON THE ROPES IN A HECK OF A GAME IN A DIVISION. >> Al: VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR. ROLLING AND CAUGHT AND IN TO 49er TERRITORY GOES COLBY THAT STOPS THE CLOCK. 3:01 IN REGULATION. >> Kirk: I LIKE WHAT HE DOES THIS IS EARLIER IN THE GAME, WATCH THIS THROW RIGHT HERE WITH PUKA NACUA COMING OFF THIS. YOU BOOT. YOU ROLL. THE DEFENSE COLLAPSES. LOOK AT THAT OUT THERE OUT IN THAT DEEP CORNER ROUTE BUT HE TAKES A SAFER ROUTE, WHICH IS TOTAL UNDERSTANDABLE. HE WANTS TO BE SAFE AND HE WANTS TO GET A COMPLETION. THAT WAS A BIG PLAY DOWN FIELD. >> Al: SECOND AND THREE. TO THE OUTSIDE THIS TIME. TURNING IT BACK. SPINNING. SO WILLIAMS, LAST WEEK, CARRIED 29 TIMES. HERE IT IS, 96 HOURS LATER, HE HAS CARRIED 25 TIMES WITH PROBABLY A COUPLE MORE TO COME. >> Kirk: OH, IT'S IMPRESSIVE. WATCH 79, THE RIGHT TACKLE, HAVENSTEIN, TURNS HIS BODY AND THE DEFENDER GOES WITH HIM TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW KYREN WILLIAMS TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT TO THAT EDGE AND THE SPIN MOVE OFF THE SAFETY, JI'AYIR BROWN. THE KID RUNS ANGRY. >> Al: 25 CARRIES AND 98 YARDS. WHY NOT? TO THE 34. CARRY NUMBER 26. WARNER MAKES THE TACKLE. THE 49ers ARE GOING TO SPEND THEIR FIRST TIME-OUT HERE ON THE FRONT SIDE OF THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING. >> Referee: TIME-OUT, SAN FRANCISCO, THEIR FIRST. 30 SECONDS. PLEASE SET THE GAME CLOCK -- >> Kirk: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR NEXT GEN PLAYOFF PROBABILITY. THE RAMS WITH A WIN. 50% IF THEY WOULD LOSE TONIGHT AND DROP DOWN TO 23%. YOU CAN SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF A WIN TONIGHT. ON THE OTHER SIDE, BOY, THE NINERS BACKED INTO A CORNER WITH ALL OF THESE INJURIES, HAD TO WIN THIS FOOTBALL GAME TONIGHT. IF NOT, THEY ARE DOWN TO 0.1. >> Al: DOWN TO 0.1 OF 1% WHICH I SAID AT THE BEGINNING WAS LIFE SUPPORT. >> Kirk: NINERS TWO TIMESOUT AND THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING AND TRYING TO HOLD THE RAMS TO A FIELD GOAL HERE. >> Al: PLAY CLOCK RAN OUT. THE RAMS HAVE TO TAKE A >> Referee: RAMS TIME-OUT. THEIR FIRST. >> Al: I THINK BOTH TEAMS, KYLE SHANAHAN SAYING YESTERDAY, I WANT TO SEE MORE GRIT. IT'S BEEN GRITTY GAME. >> Kirk: SLOPPY IN THE FIRST HALF BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER. LETS NOT JUST PUT THIS ONE AWAY. AS YOU KNOW, THE RAMS ARE TRYING TO BE AGGRESSIVE AND WE HAVE BEEN AGGRESSIVE ON THIS DRIVE. 49ers WITH TWO TIME-OUTS AND TWO-MINUTE WARNING. IF THEY CAN HOLD THE RAMS TO A FIELD GOAL AND GET THE BALL BACK TO BROCK PURDY, THEY ARE STILL THINKING ABOUT HAVING A SHOT TO WIN THIS FOOTBALL GAME. I WANT TO SEE HOW SEAN McVAY APPROACHES THIS KNOWING THAT KYLE HSHANAHAN WANTS HIS HANDS BACK ON THE FOOTBALL. GIVE IT TO NACUA ON A SWEEP. AND HE'LL TAKE IT TO THE 32 AND THE 49ers WILL LET THE CLOCK RUN TO THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING. I THINK A TIME-OUT ON THE FRONT SIDE OF IT. THIRD DOWN AND FOUR WHEN PLAY RESUMES. WE ARE IN SANTA CLARA. >> Al: SO TWO MINUTES TO GO, A HUGE PLAY, THIRD DOWN AND FOUR. RIGHT NOW, IF THEY DON'T GAIN A YARD, YOU'LL LOOK AT KARTY TRYING TO KICK A 50-YARD FIELD GOAL. IF THEY PICK UP A FIRST DOWN, IT WILL BE TOUGH FOR SAN FRANCISCO TO GET THE BALL BACK, BUT THEY DO HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS, BUT, BUT. THREE-RECEIVER SET TO THE RIGHT. KUPP COMES THIS WAY. 2 X2. PASS IS CAUGHT AND INSIDE THE 20 AND SPUN DOWN IS COLBY >> Kirk: SEAN McVAY WILL TELL YOU THAT HIS MOTIONS ARE AS IMPORTANT AT THE PLAY CALL THEMSELVES. HERE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT. >> Referee: TIME-OUT. >> Kirk: WHEN COOPER KUPP MOVED, HE TOOK TWO DEFENDERS WITH HIM AND THIS OPENS -- TWO DEFENDERS. IT OPENS IT UP PERFECTLY. GREAT RECOGNITION >> Kirk: AGAIN, JUST TO REITERATE. THE PRESNAP MOVEMENT. WATCH 2 AND 29 GO WITH IT. NOBODY IS ON THE TIGHT END. LOOK AT HOW COOL STAFFORD IS. HE KNOWS WHAT HE HAS ALREADY. HE JUST WAITS FOR THEM TO GET THERE AND THROWS IT TO A SPOT AND GETS THAT CRITICAL FIRST >> Al: YEAH, RAMS USE THAT ON A VAST MAJORITY OF PLAYS. MOTION ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. IT'S MORE THAN EYE CANDY. MEANWHILE, HERE -- ANGLING HIS WAY FOR AN EXTRA COUPLE OF AND THE 49ers NOW COMPELLED -- >> Referee: THIRD AND FINAL TIME-OUT FOR SAN FRANCISCO. >> Kirk: I THINK THEY USE IT 82% OF THE TIME. THEY USE IT MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE LEAGUE. AND, YET, IT'S THAT PLAY AND THAT MOMENT WHERE THE NINERS HAVE A BUST AND IT'S HAPPENED THE ENTIRE GAME WHERE THEY HAVEN'T HAD A BUST. >> Al: AND THEY VARY IT SO MUCH. SOMETIMES, THEY WILL TROT AND SOMETIMES THEY GO FULL SPEED, SOMETIMES THEY GO BACK AND FORTH WITH THE SAME GUY. JCPENNEY POSTGAME IS COMING UP AFTER THE GAME SO STICK AROUND FOR THAT. SECOND DOWN AND SEVEN. THEY TAKE ALL THE THEY CAN OFF THE CLOCK HERE. THIS TIME, THE 49ers WERE ABLE TO BUNCH THEM UP AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE ON KYREN WILLIAMS' 28th CARRY FOR 105 YARDS. POSTGAME IS COMING UP WITH CHARISSA AND THE GANG EXCLUSIVELY ON PRIME VIDEO. THE JCPENNEY POSTGAME SHOW WITH THE GANG. >> Kirk: THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THIS CLOCK DOWN TO AROUND THE 25-SECOND MARK, ROUGHLY. HERE IS THE RAMS SCHEDULE AND WHAT THEY HAVE LEFT. THE JETS, ARIZONA, AND THEN SEATTLE WEEK 18. A LOT ON THE TABLE IN THAT WINNER TAKE ALL POSSIBLY. >> Al: TWO DIVISION GAMES AT SoFI THE LAST TWO WEEKS OF THE ONE ON THE PLAY CLOCK. TO THE 11 YARD LINE GOES SO NOW CLOCK IS UNDER A HIN SO NOW CLOCK IS UNDER A HMINUTE AND DOWN TO THE 20-SECOND MARK >> Kirk: McVAY WILL LET IT JUST GO DOWN AND HE IS ALWAYS TALKING TO THE REFEREE AND TAKE A TIME-OUT WITH ONE SECOND. >> Al: YOU KNOW, BACK IN THE YEAR ONE OF "THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL," WE HAD -- I THINK WE HAD A 9-6 >> Kirk: WAS THAT INDY/DENVER? >> Al: HOW COULD YOU FORGET? >> Kirk: I FORGOT THE SCORE. THAT WAS O.T., WASN'T IT? >> Al: AND YOU SAID HOW CAN THEY LEAD GOING OVER? NOT THIS GAME. THIS WAS FOR 9-6 GAME OR WHATEVER IT WINDS UP, MAYBE 12-6. >> Kirk: TOUGH CONDITIONS. >> Al: FOR SURE, TOUGH CONDITIONS. >> Referee: PLEASE SET THE GAME CLOCK -- >> Al: PLAYOFF PICTURE. DETROIT ONE SEED AT THE MOMENT. PHILADELPHIA ON THEIR HEELS WITH ONE SEED. THEN SEATTLE AND TAMPA. THE OTHER DIVISIONS WITH WASHINGTON ARE THE WILDCARDS AT THE MOMENT BUT THE RAMS VERY MUCH IN THAT PICTURE IF THEY GET TO 8-6. MEANWHILE, IT BEGINS TO RAIN AGAIN. METAPHOR CAL FOR WHAT THE 49ers ARE FACING RIGHT NOW. KARTY FOR A CHIP SHOT NOW, 29-YARD FIELD GOAL. THE RAMS HAVE ENDED THEIR LAST THREE DRIVES WITH THREE FIELD GOALS. SO 18 SECONDS REMAIN. >> Kirk: BROCK PURDY, THIS OFFENSE OF THE 49ers, NO CHRISTIAN McCAFFREY AND NO BRANDON AIYUK AND NO TRENT TONIGHT 197 TOTAL YARDS. 197, THE SECOND FEWEST EVER UNDER KYLE SHANAHAN. 164 WHEN THEY PLAYED THE EELS IN THE '22 CHAMPIONSHIP GAME WHEN BROCK PURDY WENT DOWN WITH THAT INJURY. >> Al: THAT WAS AGAINST THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES. >> Kirk: BIG INTERCEPTION WAS HUGE. >> Al: WILLIAMS. DARIOUS WILLIAMS. THE RAMS HAVE TEN DAYS OFF. TEAMS USED TO MOAN AND GROAN ABOUT THURSDAY NIGHT GAMES. NOW WE HEAR ALMOST EVERY COACH SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT? WE LIKE IT AND YOU GET BACK TO WORK AND THEN TEN DAYS OFF. THE WHOLE THING HAS KIND OF FLIPPED. >> Kirk: I THINK IT'S A MINDSET, TOO. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? YOU CAN'T CHANGE IT SO TRY TO TAKE A POSITIVE SPIN. ON THE BACK END, A REWARD WHEN YOU WIN A FOOTBALL GAME. >> Al: LATE IN THE SEASON AND GET YOUR GUYS HEALTHIER ANY WAY. EVANS' KICK. THEY GOING TO TAKE IT OUT FROM THE END ZONE HERE AND THIS IS SAMUEL TRYING TO BECOME A MAJOR HERO AND OUT TO THE 36 YARD FLAG COMES IN. YOU ALMOST NEVER SEE IT WITH A NEW KICKOFF RULE, THAT GUY DEEP IN THE END ZONE, BUT DEEBO THINKING, I GOT TO DO SOMETHING. >> Kirk: HE GETS A HORSE COLLAR ON TOP OF IT F15 MORE YARDS, SO IT PAYS OFF FOR HIM. >> Al: 41-YARD KICKOFF RETURN. >> Referee: PERSONAL FOUL, HORSE COLLAR TACKLE, LOS ANGELES NUMBER 21. ADD 15 YARDS TO THE ENDS OF THE RUN. >> Al: CHARLES WOOD, ROOKIE OUT OF SMU WITH THAT PENALTY. KARTY FOOLING IS LOOMING LARGE RIGHT NOW. 11 SECONDS. YOU CAN REALLY -- YOU KNOW, I THINK THE RAMS ARE GOING TO TRY TO PROTECT THE EDGES. TECHNICALLY, IF YOU HAVE A PLAY WHERE YOU CAN GET DOWN FIELD' GET OUT OF BOUNDS OR YOU GET A PLAY AND CAN YOU GET UP TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND FIRE IT INTO THE GROUND AND TRY TO KILL THE CLOCK? BUT THE RAMS ARE PROTECTING BOTH EDGES ALL THE WAY NEAR THE SIDELINE. >> Al: ONLY ONE GUY WITH HIS HAND DOWN SO THE NEXT TO NO RUSH NEXT TO NO PLAY HERE. >> Kirk: RAMS, TIME-OUT. >> Referee: TIME-OUT BY THE >> Al: PUT THAT ONE SECOND BACK ON THE CLOCK. >> Kirk: OF COURSE, IT CAN'T BE EASY, RIGHT? >> Al: I'M THINKING THE SAME THING, RIGHT? >> Kirk: IT CAN'T BE EASY. >> Al: THE OLD RINGO STARR THING. IT DON'T COME EASY. NO GAMES COME EASY THESE DAYS IT SEEMS. >> Kirk: WE SAW THE COMMANDERS BEAT THE BEARS ON A HAIL MARY. >> Al: OH, BOY. OH, BOY. DID WE EVER. >> Kirk: THAT ONE WENT VIRAL, DIDN'T IT? EVERY KANSAS CITY GAME ENDS WITH A NAIL-BITER AT THE END. >> Kirk: OH, MY GOSH. >> Al: HOW WILL THIS ONE GO IN THE BOOKS? BALL RIGHT AT THE 50 YARD LINE. SO THE RAMS HAD ONE MAN WITH HIS HAND DOWN. NOW YOU GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT DEFENSIVE LOOK. >> Kirk: AND A DIFFERENT LINEUP. THEY HAD SPEIGHTS DOWN TO THE BOTTOM. >> Al: THREE-MAN RUSH. EIGHT BACK. TRYING TO GET IT TO PEARSALL TO GET OUT OF BOUNDS BUT HE CAN'T BUT THEY STILL HAVE SIX SECONDS >> Kirk: THAT IS WHAT YOU NEEDED. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A WELL-DESIGNED PLAY. HE DIDN'T PANIC. HE DIDN'T RUSH. HE WAITED FOR PEARSALL. IT WAS A LONG DEVELOPING ROUTE AND IF HE IS ABLE TO CONNECT ON THAT, THAT GETS THEM DOWN TO INSIDE THE 35 YARD LINE. NOW, YOU KNOW, YOU GOT A SHOT. AT THIS POINT, SIX SECONDS, YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAIL MARY OFF TO THE RIGHT HERE. >> Al: EXTRA RUSH. THEY ARE GOING TO ENDS THE GAME WITH A SACK! SO THE RAMS, INSTEAD OF SENDING THREE AND DROPPING EIGHT AND SENDING FIVE, ROZEBOOM GETS CREDIT FOR THE SACK. THE RAMS HAVE NOW WON 7 OF THEIR LAST 9. >> Kirk: A GREAT CALL BY CHRIS SHULA. SO OFTEN, LIKE YOU SAID, IT'S THREE AND YOU DROP EIGHT AND EVERYBODY IS BACK IN THE END INSTEAD, THEY SHOWED THREE AND THEN AS THE BALL IS SNAPPED, THOSE TWO LINEBACKERS, THEY DIALED UP THE HEAT. >> Al: TWO GUYS WITH A LONG HISTORY TOGETHER McVAY AND >> Kirk: WATCH THE LINEBACKERS. HERE THEY COME. IT'S ACTUALLY A SAFETY, KAM CURL WITH THE LINEBACKER ROSEBOOK AND THEY GET TO GREAT CALL. >> Al: SO THE RAMS, IT TOOK THEM FOUR DRIVES OR ALMOST THE ENTIRE FIRST QUARTER TO GET A FIRST DOWN TONIGHT. AND NOT THAT THE OFFENSE WAS ANY GREAT SHAKES FOR EITHER SIDE. 3-3 WAS THE HALFTIME SCORE. IT'S A GAME OF FIELD GOALS. KARTY KICKED FOUR. MOODY KICKS TWO. >> Kirk: I KNOW IT WASN'T A PRETTY NIGHT TONIGHT FOR THE RAMS BUT DON'T YOU HAVE THAT FEELING WITH SEAN McVAY AND STAFFORD AND KYREN WILLIAMS AND PUKA AND COOPER KUPP AND A YOUNG DEFENSE GETTING BETTER? IF THEY END UP WINNING THIS DIVISION, I DON'T KNOW IF I'D WANT TO SEE THEM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A BRACKET. >> Al: WHATEVER IT TAKES. IT'S EITHER 44, 42, OR A FEW DAYS LATER, IT'S 12-6. THE NAME OF THE GAME EDWA IRDS,S YOU HER PMLAY
