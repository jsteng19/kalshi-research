UPSET WHEN OVER THE RAVENS THREE WEEKS AGO. CLEVELAND WINNING THE TOSS, THEY DEFER, JUSTIN HOPKINS KICKS IT OFF. BACK FOR PITTSBURGH, GAME TIME RIGHT AT THE FREEZING MARK, AND OFF WE GO. THE BALL IS PICKED UP, RUN BACK BY PATTERSON, THEY PICK IT UP AND HERE COMES WILSON. 10 REALLY GOOD YEARS, THEN A FORGETTABLE STAY IN DENVER. WHEN HE GOT HEALTHY, FIELDS STARTED THE YEAR. >> GOOD FIT FOR RUSSELL WILSON AND HARRIS. AL: RIGHT OFF THE BAT SHELBY HARRIS TAKES CARE OF NAGY HE HARRIS, NO RELATION. KIRK: THIS IS WHAT THE BROWNS NEED TO DO. DEFENSE HAS GOT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO BEAT THE STEELERS AND GET SHORT FIELDS. JIM SCHWARTZ HAS AN AGGRESSIVE APPROACH. AL: IN THE BACKFIELD, HARRIS STARTS. SECOND AND ONE. AGAIN, A HECK OF A YEAR, YOU'VE GOT HARRIS IN THE BACKGROUND, DON'T OVERLOOK THIS KID. >> WATCHED HIM COME OVER, TAKE HIM OUT AND GO DOWNHILL. THAT IS THE CHANGE OF PACE. SECOND OR THIRD DEFENSE. AL: HARRIS COMES IN, QUICK THROW. DARNELL WASHINGTON, BIG, THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO WORK HIM INTO THE PASSING GAME. >> AT GEORGIA, BROCK BOWERS WAS GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION AND WE THOUGHT HE LOOKED LIKE A TACKLE BUT GREAT BLOCKER. IMPROVING AS A RECEIVER. AL THE PAST IS CAUGHT, A TACKLE SETTING UP THE FIRST THIRD DOWN. KIRK: THEY WANT WILSON TO RUN THE FOOTBALL, GET IT OUT OF HIS HANDS AND HANDED OFF TO JUSTIN FIELDS. AL: THERE IS, FIELDS COMES IN, SPECIAL PACKAGE FOR HIM. MAKING A THROW IF NEED BE. THIRD AND ONE. BRAD ALLEN, THE REFEREE. THAT IS WASHINGTON AND FIELDS CAN COME OUT AND THEN WILSON WILL COME BACK IN. KIRK: THE RHYTHM AND THE CADENCE, ONE QUARTERBACK TO THE NEXT AT THE BOTTOM, JUST A SMALL LITTLE THING. THAT IS THE RISK YOU TAKE. AL: YOU WOULD THINK STEELERS FANS MIGHT OUTNUMBER THE BROWNS FANS, THAT IS NOT THE CASE. THE PASS IS CAUGHT. PAT FREIERMUTH AND STEELERS FANS WHO MADE THE TRIP. KIRK: IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF HIS SKILL SET, ABLE TO SEPARATE FROM BRAD, WELL DESIGNED PLAY, THIRD DOWN AFTER THE PENALTY. AL: MORAN IS THE RUNNING BACK. GOOD RUN AGAIN. TAKEN DOWN, THORNHILL PICKS UP SIX AND THE GAME IS OPEN FOR PITTSBURGH. KIRK: SMITH WAS A PERFECT FIT. YOU THINK WHO WOULD FIT AND REMEMBER THAT CANADA YEARS, DID NOT FIT WITH MIKE TOMLIN AND THEY FOUND THAT WITH SMITH. WE SAW DERRICK HENRY, WITH THE TITANS. NOW HE FITS. AL: FLURRIES KEEPING IT, WILSON TAKEN DOWN, FOUR AND A HALF MINUTES INTO THE GAME. RUSSELL WILSON, MIKE TOMLIN OF COURSE, WHEN HE GOT THE JOB HE WAS 34, WINNING THE SUPER BOWL HIS SECOND YEAR, GOT THERE AGAIN IN HIS FOURTH YEAR, ROLLING ALONG. KIRK: INCREDIBLE. IT IS SO HARD TO SUSTAIN EXCELLENCE THE WAY HE HAS. >> WILSON UNDER PRESSURE, MYLES GARRETT LOVES TO HEAR IT FROM THE CROWD AND HE WILL. SEVEN SACKS, FOURTH AND 11. KIRK: GREAT MATCHUP. CHIP INITIALLY BUT NOT TO SLOW DOWN A MYLES GARRETT, GREAT COVERAGE ALLOWS HIM TO GET THE SACK, RUSSELL WILSON HOLDS THE FOOTBALL, A DANGEROUS THING TO DO. AL: 58 YARDS, THE ONE HE MISSED WAS FROM 62. WYATT TO THE RIGHT SO HE MISSES KIRK: THERE IT IS. AL: INCOMPLETE. FIRST PLAY IS A PASS TO THE OUTSIDE AND WE WERE WONDERING HOW MUCH PASSING YOU COULD SEE. KIRK: WE EXPECTED RAIN AND IT TURNED DID TO -- TURNED INTO SNOW SHOWERS. WE JUST KNOW IT IS COLD. AL: HANDOFF WILL GO TO NICK CHUBB. SLUNG BACK AND THE CROWD ONCE A FLAG. THE ROOKIE MADE A PHENOMENAL INTERCEPTION BUT NOTHING HAPPENED AND ON WE GO. KIRK: CHALLENGING YEAR, AFTER TONIGHT EIGHT DIFFERENT OFFENSES AND THE MOST IN THE NFL, WATSON, WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT. MANY MISSED CUES AND THERE'S ANOTHER ONE. REFEREE: FALSE START, OFFENSE. THIRD DOWN. AL: THAT'S ONE GUY YOU CAN REALLY COUNT ON, HE'S BEEN GREAT. KIRK: INTERIOR HAS BEEN HIS STRENGTH, IT'S JUST BEEN REALLY AT THE EDGES, TRYING TO STAY HEALTHY, CONTINUITY, WITHOUT IT IT'S TOUGH TO DO ANYTHING. AL: INTO STEELER TERRITORY, TAKEN DOWN SHY OF THE FIRST DOWN. THE BROWNS ARE LAST IN THIRD DOWN CONVERSIONS. YOU LOOK AT THE GUY WHO PONCE -- PUNTS, DESCENDED DOWN TOWARD CALVIN AUSTIN. WHAT IS THAT? THE FLAG IS DOWN, WHATEVER THAT WAS. TO THE WIND MOVE IT? KIRK: THE GUNNER ENDED UP ALMOST IN THE THIRD ROW, THAT'S WHERE THE FLAG CAME IN. AL: THE KICKER WAS 10 OR 12 YARDS, THE BROWNS ARE GOING BACK TO THE BENCH, WE WILL SEE WHAT THE PENALTY IS. KIRK: DEEP INTO THE BENCH, BISHOP PUSHED AND PUSHED BEYOND THE BENCH. >> 15 YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN. AL: CARRIE MCCULLY PUT ON A COAT THIS WAY. KIRK: IT'S ILLEGAL TO BLOCK THE GUNNER OUT OF BOUNDS. ONCE WE WATCH THE CLEVELAND PLAYER PULLS HIM ALL THE WAY INTO THE PICTURE HE. IS HE BLOCKING OR IS HE PULLED IN? I COULD MAKE A CASE THAT IT WAS MORE OF A PULLED INTO AS OPPOSED TO A BLOCK. AL: MAY HAVE BEEN ANOTHER FLAG. FALSE START ON PITTSBURGH. THE PUNT WENT 12 YARDS. THAT FALSE START IS ON CO HIS BROTHER PLAYS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BALL. KIRK: BOTH OF THESE OFFENSES ARE SLOW TO SETTLE INTO THE RAIN. ANOTHER FLINCH BY PITTSBURGH. SAW WASHINGTON EARLIER. NOW IT'S HAYWARD. AL: FIRST AND 15. CALVIN AUSTIN ON THE MOVE. INTO THE OUTSIDE WITH ROOM TO RUN. STIFF ARM THERE. HARRIS BEHIND ISAAC SEUMALO. SECOND DOWN AND 4. KIRK: WE TALKED ABOUT THE FIT OF ARTHUR SMITH. GOING OUT AND BRINGING THREE ROOKIES TO ALMOST RESET THIS TEAM AND THIS ROSTER. I THINK IT WAS INTENTIONAL TO GO OUT AND ESTABLISHES HER -- ESTABLISH A CERTAIN TOUGHNESS. MCCORMICK AT RIGHT GUARD. BOTH THESE GUYS, ROOKIE. AL: SHORT DROP. RUSSELL DOESN' RUSSELL DOESN'T LIKE WHAT HE SEES. HE GETS PUSHED OUT OF BOUNDS BY JORDAN HICKS. THAT WILL MAKE IT THIRD DOWN AND 6 AFTER A LOSS OF 2. KIRK: IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN RUSSELL WILSON PLAY, HE IS 4-0. WONDERING WHAT HE'S DOING RIGHT. I THINK WHAT HE'S DOING RIGHT, WE SAW IT IN THE FIRST DRIVE. WHEN HE'S PLAYING IN A QUICK GAME AND HE'S MAKING QUICK DECISIONS, ALONG WITH THE RUNNING GAME, THAT'S WHERE THEY WANT TO LIVE. THAT STRAIGHT DROP BACK WHERE HE STARTS TO CREATE AND GO BACK TO HIS SEATTLE DAYS. HE JUST DOESN'T HAVE THAT IN HIM IN HIS OFFENSE. AL: THIRD DOWN AND 6. GOING DEEP DOWN. IT'S CAUGHT. PICKENS COVERING WELL. ONE OF THE TOP CORNERS IN THE LEAGUE GOING UP AGAINST PICKENS. PICKENS WINS THAT BATTLE. THIRD AND 6. THEY PICK UP 32. KIRK: HE WENT TO THE IN ROUTE. THIS TIME HE OPTS TO GO DOWNFIELD. GREAT SEPARATION AT THE END. DENZEL WARD NEVER ABLE TO LOCATE THE FOOTBALL. WHAT A JOB. NICE THROW TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE AND A HECKUVA JOB OF FOCUSING ON THE FOOTBALL THERE BY PICKENS. AL: TO THE GROUND. TO THE LEFT SIDE. KIRK: PICKENS WILL USE EVERY OUNCE OF HIS BODY. THE LEFT LEG, THE RIGHT KNEE. EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO SECURE THE FOOTBALL AND IT NEVER TOUCHES THE GROUND. AL: WE'VE CAPABLE. DEVELOPING MORE CONSISTENCY THIS YEAR. HARRIS IS BACK IN THERE. SECOND DOWN AND 6. HARRIS. HE'S AS DURABLE AS THEY COME. HE STARTED HIS FIRST GAME AS A ROOKIE. HE HASN'T MISSED A SINGLE START SINCE HE SIGNED AS THE NUMBER ONE PICK BACK IN 21. KIRK: THERE'S A LOT TO LIKE ABOUT THAT. HE WILL ONLY GET BETTER AND BETTER. I LOVE HOW THEY CONTINUE TO REFEREE -- ROTATE HIM. GOT TO GIVE JIM SCHWARTZ CREDIT. PITTSBURGH WANTS TO RUN TH THEY WILL TRY TO OCCASIONALLY GET YOU ON SOME PLAY ACTION ON EARLY DOWNS. HE IS SENDING HIS DEFENSIVE LINE LOSE. HE WANTS THEM TO PENETRATE AND CREATE THOSE NEGATIVE PLAYS. AL: FEEL THERE'S ALREADY 2-3 NOT THIS TIME THOUGH. 38. VAN JEFFERSON. TACKLED BY RONNIE. NOW ROB TOMLIN ON FOURTH DOWN. LOOKS LIKE A SHORT TWO. TAKE YOUR PICK. KIRK: HE WILL BRING FIELDS OUT. WITH FIELDS OUT, IT'S NOT JUST THE QUARTERBACK RUNNING IT. THERE'S THE POSSIBILITY OF ZONE READ WHERE HE CAN READ OFF THE END MAN, GIVE IT OR PULL IT. THEY COULD RUN QUARTERBACK THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. HE'S GOING TO RUN AND THEN POLLITT IT AND THROW IT. A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS OPEN UP WIN TWO RUNS OUT THERE. AL: THEY SENT PATTERSON ALL THE WAY TO THE LEFT. FIELDS LOOKING FOR ROOM. WON'T FIND IT. GOOD GAME. HE DOES IT AGAIN. TURNOVER ON DOWNS. CAME BACK WEEK ONE. THE TOWN IS SO EXCITED. FINAL SCORE 0-33. KIRK: OUCH. AL: HERE WE ARE. LOOKING FOR ROOM. FINDING SOME. BREAKING TACKLES GOES NICK JOE. KIRK: LET'S GO BACK TO THAT FOURTH DOWN RUN. IT ALMOST LOOKED LIKE WHAT A PULLING GUARD IS TRYING TO GET SOMETHING IN HERE AND THEN HE ENDS UP PULLING TO THE OUTSIDE. YOU'VE GOT MYLES GARRETT WHO ENDS UP TAKING AWAY THE EDGE. THEN YOU'VE GOT GRANT DELPIT WHO IS DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB THERE MAKING SURE HE CAN'T BOUNCE INTO THE OUTSIDE. THERE'S GARRETT. JUST NOWHERE TO GO. GIVE THE DEFENSE A LOT OF CREDIT. ANOTHER BIG STOP THERE. AL: INSIDE OF THREE MINUTES TO GO IN THE CORRIDOR. SHOVE AGAIN. OVER A YEAR OFF AGAINST HE GOT HURT. HE'D ALREADY HAD MAJOR SURGERY IN GEORGIA YEARS AND YEARS AGO. HE GOT BACK A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. LET'S HOPE HE'S FULLY RECOVERED. HE IS SOME KIND OF PLAYER. KIRK: REALLY IS. WHEN HE'S HEALTHY, HE'S AS GOOD AS THE LEAGUE HAS TO OFFER. THAT INJURY HE HAD IN COLLEGE, IT WAS DEVASTATING. HE RECOVERED. YOU HOPE THE SAME AFTER THIS INJURY AS WELL. AL: 32. OFF-BALANCE. INCOMPLETE. INTENDED FOR CEDRIC TILLMAN. SO ONCE AGAIN, THE BROWNS, LAST IN THE LEAGUE CONVERSIONS. THEY ARE 0-2 SO FAR TONIGHT. KIRK: LOOK AT THESE EDGE RUSHERS THERE. HE'S GOT ENOUGH TIME. WHEN HE STEPPED UP, HE COLLIDES WITH THE GUARD. GOT OFF-BALANCE. COULDN'T COM ACCURATE THROW. AL: THE FIRST BOND WAS 12 YARDS. THIS IS A LITTLE BIT BETTER. NICE LITTLE BOUNCE TO ALLOW CLEVELAND TO DOWN IT IN THE 10 AL: BACK WE COME HERE 2:01 TO GO IN THE OPENING QUARTER. WILSON CHECKING OUT THE PLAY. KIRK: THE BROWNS COULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR BETTER STARTING FIELD POSITION. THEY ARE RIGHT AROUND MIDFIELD. AL: PITTSBURGH STOP THIS FIELD GOAL AND THEN TURNED IT OVER ON KIRK: THE STORY IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE BOTH OFFENSES BEING ABLE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL. YOU CAN SEE THE PENALTIES FOR THE STEELERS TONIGHT. FIRST DOWN. OFF TO A SLOW START HERE. PITTSBURGH RUNNING THE FOOTBALL TO SET UP THEIR PLAY-ACTION. WARD. AL: SECOND AND 6. GARRETT ON THE SIDELINES FOR THIS PLAY. ROLLING, THROWING. SHORT THROW. AGAIN OF ABOUT THREE THAT TIME. KIRK: STEELERS RECEIVER VAN JEFFERSON, WE JUST LEARNED HE QUESTIONABLE TO RETURN BECAUSE OF A QUAD INJURY. HE WAS ON THE INJURY REPORT LAST WEEK WITH THAT QUAD. PLAYED THROUGH IT. NOW IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BOTHERING HIM. HE JUST GOT OFF THE EXE BIKE. AL: PROBABLY MEANS MORE ACTION FOR MIKE WILLIAMS PERHAPS. THIRD DOWN AND 2. THE STEELERS HAVE A STREAK GOING THAT'S IN JEOPARDY. THEY HAVE SCORED IN EACH OF THE LAST 20 TWO QUARTERS. 5.5 GAMES. THAT PASS IS PULLED IN AT THE 27 YARD LINE. PICKENS WITH WARD WHICH WOULD BE A GOOD BATTLE TONIGHT. KIRK: THE POSITION IT ALLOWS PICKENS TO SHORT -- FIELD WARD. WHEN HE'S ON, THE QUICKLY. WARD GETS THERE A LITTLE BITTERLY. HE IS NOW 7-7 TO GET THE GAME STARTED. RUSSELL WILSON FOR 77 YARDS. PRETTY GOOD START. AL: ANYWAY. FIRST AND 10. KIRK:MAHOMES, CHIEFS, RAIDERS ON BLACK FRIDAY. FIRST DOWN FOR PITTSBURGH HERE. START ON THE GROUND HERE. WARREN TAKEN DOWN AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. MIKE VRABEL HAD BEEN IN TENNESSEE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. FIRED AT THE END OF LAST SEASON. PEOPLE THOUGHT HE MIGHT GET A HEAD COACHING JOB. HE DIDN'T. HE'S OUT THERE ON THE STREET IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING. GOING SKIING OR WHATEVER HE WANTED. CALLED HIM AND SAYS,, ON OVER. HELP ME OUT HERE. GET ME A LITTLE TUTELAGE NOW HE'S ON THE SIDELINES TONIGHT. KIRK: STARTED OFF. WASN'T GOING TO COME OFF TOO MUCH. EACH WEEK HE GETS A LITTLE BIT MORE INVOLVED. AL: THIS IS WARREN AGAIN. YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE FANS HE'S BEEN TO THE PLAYOFFS TWICE. A TON OF QUARTERBACKS. YOU BRING A GUY IN AND THE FAN BASE STARTS TO GO, MAYBE WE SHOULD GET THIS COACH. KIRK: WHEN I LEARNED MIKE VRABEL WAS A GOOD COACH, HE JUST GOT DONE WINNING THE SUPER BOWL. HE COACHED KINDERGARTEN FOOTBALL AND HE TALKED TO THEM THE WAY HE TALKS TO THE BROWNS PLAYERS. I WAS LIKE, THAT GUY BE A GREAT COACH. IN THIS POLITICALLY CORRECT STYLE OF COACHING, THAT GUY IS A FOOTBALL COACH EVEN WITH KIDS. AL: GETTING OPEN. FREE IS CALVIN AUSTIN. GREAT SPEED AND HE SHOWS THAT TAKES IT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO 25 YARD LINE. CALVIN AUSTIN ON A 48 YARD BOMB. KIRK: THAT'S WHAT HE CAN DO. GREAT JOB OF BEING ABLE TO ATTACK THE SAFETY. HE COMPLAINED AND COMMAND COVERAGE. HIS EYES GOT MESSED UP. HE LOOKED TO THE OUTSIDE. WITH AUSTIN SPEED, HE IS ABLE TO GET AROUND HIM AND COME CLOSE TO GETTING THAT PRESSURE WILSON. THAT'S A WELL-DESIGNED PLAY AND A GREAT JOB BY RUSSELL WILSON, FINDING THE MATCHUP A SAFETY. AL: 4-3-2 AT THE COMBINE SO HE'S A JET. HAMMERING BREAKING TACKLES. THE BALL IS OUT. WILSON IS THERE. RUSSELL WILSON IS ABLE TO SECURE IT. HARRIS FIGHTING AND IT'S HIS FIRST FUMBLE OF THE SEASON. THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER, HE RE FUMBLES. OUT. IF YOU GO BACK TO EARLIER, YOU CAN SEE RUSSELL WILSON STANDING THERE JUST IN CASE THE BALL CAME HE WAS WATCHING HIM AND WATCHING HIM AND WATCHING HIM AND WAITING FOR THE THREAT. LOOK AT HIM STANDING THERE JUST IN CASE THE BALL GETS POPPED AL: SECOND DOWN AND 13 NOW. PITTSBURGH WILL TAKE A 30 SECOND TIMEOUT. KIRK: LET'S REMEMBER THAT PLAY THE GREAT THROW BY RUSSELL JUST THAT VETERAN LEADERSHIP. JUST IN CASE THERE'S A FUMBLE BY IF HE'S NOT THERE, EVEN PAYING ATTENTION, IT'S A FUMBLE AND IT'S A BROWNS FOOTBALL. >> NOT SHE HARRIS TOLD ME RUSSELL WILSON WAS THE VETERAN THAT THIS TEAM NEEDED. HE SAID THE PAST TWO YEARS, THE STEELERS HAVE BEEN A YOUNG TEAM. EVEN HE WAS IN THE THIRD YEAR. HE FELT GUYS WERE LOOKING UP TO HE BELIEVES THEY HAVE THE ONE UP EACH WEEK BECAUSE OF WILSON AND HIS KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC TENDENCIES OF PLAYERS, COACHES, AND SCHEMES. YOU SAW IT AT WORK. AL: HE'S BEEN REJUVENATED HIMSELF. NOT THAT HE LOST CONFIDENCE. HE IS ALWAYS A CONFIDENT GUY. THOSE TWO YEARS IN DENVER, WOW. KIRK: OH YEAH. AL: SECOND DOWN AND 13. OFF THE FAKE AND HE THROWS IT TO THE FLAG IS THROWN. HARRIS GETS SPILLED AT THE 27. WE WILL HEAR FROM BRAD ALLEN -- NEXT. >> THE ILLEGAL FORMATION. OFFENSE NUMBER 83 WAS COVERING NUMBER 80. PENALTY IS DECLINED. AL: HAYWARD COVERING WASHINGTON. THIRD DOWN AND 10 NOW. KIRK: THIS IS AN AREA THAT PITTSBURGH IS TRYING TO COME UP WITH ANSWERS. NOT JUST RED ZONE. THEY MOVE THE BALL PRETTY CONSISTENTLY WITH RUSSELL WILSON IN THERE. THE CLOSER THEY GET DOWN INTO THE RED ZONE, THEY WILL GET MORE CHALLENGES TO BE ABLE TO OFF DRIVES. THAT'S RIGHT WAS WELL -- ROZ AL: 29 IN FACT. MOST IN THE LEAGUE. THIRD DOWN AND 10. PRESSURE. BATTED AWAY. TRYING TO WORK HIS WAY FOR EXTRA YARDAGE. WARREN TAKES IT TO THE 24. BOSWELL MR. EARLIER FROM 58. ONLY HIS SECOND MISS OF THE TWICE THIS SEASON, BOSWELL, THE WIND IS WHIPPING. IF ANYTHING, IT'S GOING INTO THE WIND. SIX FIELD GOALS LAST WEEK. THEY DIDN'T SCORE A TOUCHDOWN. ONE THE GAME. SIX TOUCHDOWNS AGAINST ATLANTA EARLIER IN THE SEASON. THIS WILL PUT THE FIRST -- BUT THE FIRST POINTS OF THE GAME ON THE SCOREBOARD. LOOKING GOOD. KIRK: MOVEMENT ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE LINE TO PUSH IT BACK FIVE MORE YARDS. >> FALSE START, OFFENSE, 97. KIRK: WHEN YOU ARE PITTSBURGH AND YOUR MARGIN OF ERROR IS SO SMALL BECAUSE YOU ARE WINNING WITH DEFENSE AND SPECIAL TEAMS, WHEN YOU ARE WINNING LIKE THAT, YOU ARE ON THE ROAD ON A SHORT WEEK. YOU'VE GOT TO PLAY CLEAN. THEY HAVEN'T DONE THAT IN THE FIRST HALF. AL: HE'S AN EASY PLAYING THREE 31 DEGREES. 48 YARD FIELD GOAL. BOSWELL. THAT KICK IS GOOD. INSIDE THE RIGHT UPRIGHT. 30TH OF THE SEASON. HE LEADS THE LEAGUE IN POINTS. 3-0 PITTSBURGH. NOT GOING AGAINST EACH OTHER. THERE'S A LOT OF PRIDE ON THE LINE. DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR FOR T.J. WATT LAST YEAR. MYLES GARRETT. 104 SACKS. GARRETT, NUMBER FIVE. JUST TREMENDOUS TO WATCH. THEY DO IT IN SUCH DIFFERENT WAYS. AL: THAT WILL BE A TOUCHBACK AS THE BALL WAS TAKEN OUTSIDE THE ONE AND THEN FORD HAD TO PICK IT UP IN THE END ZONE. DOWNS IT THERE. OUT TO THE 30 IT WILL COME. IN COMES WANT. KIRK: IMAGINE HAVING AN OLDER BROTHER AS GOOD AS J.J. WATT. YOU TRY TO DEAL WITH HIM IN THE NFL BUT EVEN IN COLLEGE. GOING TO THE SAME SCHOOL, HE'S VERY DIFFERENT STYLE OF PASS ROUNDS ARE -- PASS RUSHER. YOU CANNOT IMITATE HIM. HE HAD TO CARVE HIS OWN LANE AND HE'S DONE THAT OBVIOUSLY THROUGHOUT HIS COLLEGE CAREER AND BRILLIANT NFL CAREER. AL: JEROME FORD IS THE RUNNING BACK NOW. COMES OUT TO THE 20 YARD LINE. IT WAS OUTSIDE THE GOAL LINE. DOWN INTO THE END ZONE. FORD IS THE RUNNING BACK HERE. THE PASS IS CAUGHT HERE. LONG MOVE FOR A GAIN OF 15 YARDS. BIG CATCH. SOONER OR LATER, YOU KNEW THEY WOULD PICK UP A FIRST DOWN AND THEY DID. KIRK: GOING BACK TO THE KICK RETURN. LOOKS LIKE IT WAS TOUCHED. OUTSIDE OF THE END ZONE, RIGHT? >> SURE. ZONE. IN THE KICK BROUGHT IT IN THE END ZONE DOWN THERE. IT'S A TOUCHBACK BUT IT COMES TO THE 20 BECAUSE IT FIRST TOUCHED IN THE LANDING ZONE, NOT T AL: THEY START FROM THE 20. TAKE IT OUT TO THE FIRST FIRST DOWN. THE PASS IS CAUGHT ON THE NEAR SIDE. SPUN AROUND. TAKEN DOWN FOR A GAIN OF 8 JERRY JEUDY. KIRK: EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A TEAM THAT WANTED TO TRY TO ESTABLISH THE RUN, EVERYONE WE SPOKE TO THIS WEEK SAID, WE HAVE TO GET OUR RUNNING GAME GOING. WE'VE GOT TO GET GAME GOING. WHICH WE ALL KNOW THEY WANT TO DO, ESPECIALLY WITH NICK CHEUNG. THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT. ONE THING THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IS THROW THE BALL. ESPECIALLY GETTING IT OUT OF HIS HANDS QUICKER. TRIED THE FIRST COUPLE SERIES. NOW THEY ARE ABLE TO THROW IT. AL: ANOTHER FIRST DOWN HERE. JERRY JUNIOR GOES BACK TO BACK. RUSSELL WILSON LOOKS ACROSS THE FIELD AND SAYS, HE WAS MY THE LAST FEW YEARS. KIRK: WITH AMARI COOPER B TRADED TO BUFFALO, TERRY JUDY TAKES OVER AS THE MAIN GO TO WEAPON NOW. ALMOST WIDE RECEIVER ONE THIS OFFENSE. ALL THREE OF THESE RECEIVERS WITH AMARI COOPER NOW OUT, JUDY AND CEDRIC TILLMAN, PRETTY GOOD GROUP. NO JOKE WHO AND THE TIGHT END. A LOT OF WEAPONS. AL: HAVEN'T SEEN HIM TARGETED YET. MAYBE NOW. OVER THE MIDDLE. THAT'S CAUGHT BY JERRY JEUDY. TACKLED BY JOEY BOERNER. SO WINSTON IS NOW 4-6 OF THOSE HAVE GONE TO JUDY. KIRK: THE OFFENSIVE LINE IS DOING A HECK JOB ON THIS DRIVE, GIVING HIM TIME. YOU TALKED ABOUT T.J. WATT. THE PUSH OFF AT THE TOP OF THE ROUTE BY JUDY. LOOK AT THE TIME HE HAS. THE ACCURACY BY WINSTON. AL: TOUCHING HIS HELMET SAYING, HOW ABOUT THAT? 8:20 TO GO IN THE HALF. FORD LOOKING FOR ROOM. BARRELS HIS WAY. HE MIGHT HAVE THE FIRST DOWN BY THE TIME THIS IS OVER. JEROME FORD, THEY WILL MARK HIM A LITTLE BIT SHORT OF THE FIRST. KIRK: HOW ABOUT THAT? THEY GET THIS DRIVE GOING THROUGH THE AIR. THEN YOU ARE CHANGING TRYING TO GET FRESH LEGS IN THIS IS JUST TREMENDOUS EFFORT. FORTIS JUST DRIVING HIS CARRYING DEFENDERS FOR ANOTHER FOUR OR FIVE YARD. AL: SECOND AND 1. SHOVED BACK IN. WINSTON PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN. STILL REALLY IN THE REHAB PROCESS IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING. THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T OVERWORK POINT. KIRK: HE'S ONE OF THE H WORKERS. YOU KNOW HE'S GOING TO BE A GUY THAT WILL NEVER SAY NO. THEY HAVE SUCH GRATITUDE AND APPRECIATION FOR WHO HE'S BEEN. THEY ARE TRYING TO EAS BACK. HE'S TOLD US HE FEELS LIKE HE'S CLOSE TO 100%. AL: PASS TO THE OUTSIDE. SHORT GAME HERE. PRESTON SMITH WHO WAS PICKED UP RECENTLY FROM GREEN BAY. SECOND DOWN. KIRK: KEN DORSEY GET THE HANDLE NOW FOR THE BROWNS? TRYING TO FIND THE BEST WAY TO PUT THE DRIVE TOGETHER THE COUPLE SERIES WHERE THEY HAD GREAT FIELD POSITION. ENDED UP PUNTING AFTER TWO OR THREE OUTS. THIS TIME HE DECIDED TO OPEN IT UP WITH FORMATIONS. IT'S GOTTEN JAMEIS WINSTON INTO A NICE RHYTHM IN THE OFFENSE HAS RESPONDED. AL: THREE RUNS, FOR PASSES TO THIS POINT. SECOND DOWN AND NINE. KEEP IT ON THE GROUND HERE. DOWN TO THE 21. SETTING UP THIRD DOWN. KIRK: THE BROWNS WOULD TELL YOU THAT THEY'VE HAD SO MANY INJURIES UPFRONT. WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A STRENGTH WHICH IS THE RUNNING GAME BETWEEN WORKING BACK, THE REVOLVING DOORS OF INJURIES UPFRONT. THEY FINALLY FEEL THAT THEY ARE AS HEALTHY AS THEY CAN BE ESPECIALLY IN THE INTERIOR IT'S GOOD TO SEE. YOU START TO SEE HIM GET BETTER AT BLOCKING AS WELL. AL: FOUR-MAN RUSH. FIRES, CAUGHT. IT WILL BE A LITTLE SHORT OF THE ELIJAH MOORE THINKING A MINUTE AGO, THAT MAKES PATRICK QUEEN'S NIGHT. KIRK: HERE YOU GO. YOU ARE AT HOME. YOU ARE TO HYPHENATE. YOU ARE TAKING ON A DIVISION RIVAL. YOU HAVE BEATEN THEM 4-5 IN CLEVELAND. YOU HAVE TO GO FOR IT. AL: FOURTH AND 1. IT'S TRULY A HOME CROWD HERE. EVEN THOUGH PITTSBURGH IS 120 MILES AWAY, NOT TOO MANY TERRIBLE TOWELS. NOT AS MANY AS WE NORMALLY SEE ANYWAY. FOURTH AND 1. CAN THEY PICK UP THE FIRST? INDEED. KIRK: THAT'S A GREAT JOB BY CHUCK FEELING THIS. HIS BALKAN BOUNDS OR IT CAN BE A CUTBACK OUT THIS WAY. WATCH THE VISION HERE. HE WILL READ THE BLOCK INTO LEFT SIDE HERE. THE LINEMEN ARE ABLE TO USE THE LEVERAGE. THE LEFT TACKLE, REALLY GOOD JOB. RIGHT TACKLE PLAYING LEFT TACKLE. A HECKUVA JOB TO HELP HIM OUT. >> PATRICK QUEEN WHO IS DOWN. ENTER A TIMEOUT AS THEY WORK ON QUEEN. LESS THAN FIVE TO GO AGO. 4:53 TO GO IN THE HALF. PATRICK QUEEN IS BACK ON THE BENCH. PAYTON WILSON PICKS HIS SPOT. FIRST DOWN AND 11 YARDS. WILSON WITH A THROW. ON THE OUTSIDE. DIVING TO THE 1-YARD LINE. FIRST CATCH OF THE NIGHT. SOONER OR LATER, YOU KNEW YOU WOULD GET -- THEY WOULD GO TO WINSTON IS NOW 7-9 FOR 63. KIRK: FIRST AND 10. THREE TIGHT ENDS IN THE GAME. IT'S A GREAT LOOK TO SHOW THAT YOU ARE RUNNING THE FOOTBALL AND THEY BUS THE TREND WITH KIM DORSEY AT THE PLAY ACTION. THE EYES OF THE BACKFIELD. NOBODY PICKS HIM UP. GREAT CALL THERE. AL: BRING THE FULLBACK IN HERE. FROM THE ONE. CHUCK SCORES. TO THE END ZONE. CLEVELAND TAKES THE LEAD. 12 PLAYS, 80 YARDS. KIRK: YOU HAVE TO GIVE DORSEY A LOT OF CREDIT FOR THE ADJUSTMENTS THEY MADE WITHIN THE GAME. THIS OFFENSE, THEY ARE VERY CONFIDENT IN WHAT THEY CAN DO. QUICK DECISIONS BALL OUT. THEY FEEL THEY CAN WIN SOME MATCHUP'S ON THE PERIMETER. ONCE THEY DO THAT, THEY ARE ABLE TO GET READY QUICK BALANC AL: HOPKINS IS GOOD. WINSTON ON THE DRIVE. 6-6 FOR A 55 YARDER. AL: IN THE NFL, THERE ARE SO MANY GAMES LIKE THIS. YET ONE TEAM IS ONLY FAVORED BY 3.5 OR FOUR POINTS. YOU TALK ABOUT A TRAP GAME AND WHAT THAT MEANS AND ALL THAT STUFF. I GUESS YOU CAN LOOK AHEAD AND AWAY. RIGHT NOW, TOOK A 3-0 LEAGUE -- WHAT CAN YOU SAY? KIRK: FOR PITTSBURGH, THEY HAVE TO SCORE TOUCHDOWNS. THEY CANNOT KICK FIELD GOALS NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE PLAYING. THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET ON THE ROAD AND CONTINUE THEIR EXECUTION AND NOT BE SATISFIED AND SETTLE FOR FIELD GOALS. THE OTHER THING THAT STUCK OUT TO ME, THAT LOOKED LIKE THE BROWNS OFFENSIVE LINE. WHO IS GOING TO WIN THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE? THAT ALWAYS DECIDES THE OUTCOME. THAT DRIVE LOOKED LIKE THE BROWNS OFFENSIVE LINE THAT WE WERE EXPECTING TO SEE ALL YEAR LONG. AL: THAT KICK THROUGH THE END WE HAVE OTHER DEALS GOING. WORKS OUT GREAT. FROM THE 30 YARD LINE. A LITTLE TOSS BACK HERE. HARRIS PICKING UP A COUPLE. KIRK: INITIALLY HIS WIFE SAID, WHAT'S THE FUSS ABOUT THE FOOTBALL'S? WHY DO PEOPLE CARE SO MUCH? EARLY. NOW OBVIOUSLY SHE GETS IT. IT'S NICE FOR HIM TO BE ABLE TO UNPLUG. AL: FOR SURE. KIRK: BE AB NOT WORRY ABOUT THAT STRESS. AL: 28 YEARS, IT'S WORKING OUT. RUSSELL WILSON CONTINUES TO BE VERY ACCURATE. THE RECEIVERS ARE RUNNING GOOD ROUNDS. 10-10 SO FAR IN THIS GAME. AL: 128. YET TO THROW AN INCOMPLETION. HERE. UNDER PRESSURE. LOSES THE BALL. STRIPPED. THE BROWNS ARE THERE TO GET IT. MYLES GARRETT CAME IN. HE EXTRACTED IT. WINSTON REID COMES UP WITH IT. EARLIER, WILSON WAS ABLE TO RECOVER HARRIS'S FUMBLE. THERE GOES THE PLAYER OF THE KIRK: THAT'S PASSION ENERGY. THAT'S THE MATCHUP WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT. YOU WILL HELP OUT THE TIGHT END INITIALLY. HOW ABOUT DARNELL WASHINGTON. THAT'S NOT ENOUGH AGAINST MYLES GARRETT. HE KNOWS ABOUT THE SPEED. HE KNOWS ABOUT THE POWER THAT HE HAS. 275 POUNDS. SOMETIMES IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SACK. IT'S THAT LENGTH. GETTING HIS HANDS ON THE BALL TO KNOCK IT AWAY FROM RUSSELL. AL: SHORT STEEL FROM THE 30 LAWN -- 31. THE LONG DRIVE. THE DEFENSE HAS TO COME BACK. THAT PASS. REACHING UP FOR IT. ELIJAH MOORE MAKES THE GRAB. THE BROWNS LOOKING BUT A TWO-EIGHTS TEAM. KIRK: NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. THIS WEEK, I WENT BACK AND I LOOKED AT JAMES WINSTON. FOLLOWED HIS CAREER SO CLOSELY IN COLLEGE AT FLORIDA STATE AND WHAT HE DID EARLY IN HIS CAREER AT TAMPA. IT WENT AWAY AFTER 2019. DOWN IN NEW ORLEANS. SAT DOWN AND SAT BEHIND DREW BREES. DIDN'T START FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS UNTIL THIS OPPORTUNITY IN CLEVELAND RIGHT NOW. AL: KEEPING IT. THEY PICK UP A FIRST DOWN WITH FORWARD PROGRESS. KIRK: I THOUGHT HE HAD INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE ABOUT THOSE YEARS IN NEW ORLEANS. HE SAID ESPECIALLY IN 2020 WHEN HE LOST HIS STARTING DROP -- JOB, HE THREW 30 PICKS IN TAMPA. HE HIT ROCK BOTTOM IN NEW ORLEANS AND SAID, I LOOK I GOT TO LEARN FROM DREW AND SEAN PAYTON. SEE HIM COME IN EVERY MORNING AND STUDY HIS NOTHING WILL KEEP FROM THEIR APPOINTED ROUNDS. WE WERE INVITED ON TO THE CUYAHOGA RIVER DINNER CRUISE TONIGHT AFTER THE GAME. KIRK: I DIDN'T GET TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT. AL: THERE YOU GO. CRUISE DOWN THE CUYAHOGA. KIRK: LET'S SEE IF THE BROWNS WILL BE ABLE TO PUNCH THIS IN OUR HAVE TO SETTLE FOR A FIELD GOAL. THEY WILL NOT BE IN A HURRY, THAT'S FOR SURE. PITTSBURGH WITH TWO TIMEOUTS REMAINING. AL: FALSE START HERE. >> FALSE START. NUMBER 65. FIVE YARD PENALTY. KIRK: THIS GUY HAS PLAYED THE MAJORITY OF HIS CAREER RIGHT BECAUSE OF ALL THE INJURIES THEY HAVE HAD AT LEFT TACKLE, BUMPING OVER FROM RIGHT TACKLE OVER TO LEFT TACKLE. A LOT OF TIMES, HE' A LOT OF TIMES, HE'S OUT THERE ON AN ISLAND AGAINST REALLY GOOD PASS RUSHERS. AL: SECOND AND 13. WINSTON, DANCING, THROWING. TAKING IT AT THE 17 YARD LINE. ELIJAH MOORE. KIRK: JAMES WINSTON DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB HERE OF NOT THROWING THE BALL. HE WANTS TO GO HERE AND INSTEAD HE COMES OFF OF IT. JAMEIS WINSTON IS GOING TO MAKE HIS MIND UP AND THROW THE BALL. INSTEAD, HE WORKS FROM THE LEFT. DOESN'T PREDETERMINE. HE'S LOOKING. HE SEES SIX FLASH SO HE COMES OFF OF IT AND COMES BACK. THAT'S ALL HE'S COACHED TO DO IN THIS SYSTEM. DON'T FORCE IT. JUST TAKE IT DOWN. AL: TIMEOUT TAKEN BY PITT THERE SECOND. CLEVELAND WILL GET THE BALL TO START THE SECOND HALF. TOMLIN WANTS TO PRESERVE ENOUGH TIME TO STOP THEM HERE AND THEY WILL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME. THIRD AND 7. MIKE HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE. HE HAS SEEN IT ALL. KIRK: DOES HE HAVE A GLOSSARY OF THOSE SAYINGS? AL: UNBELIEVABLE. IT COMES NATURALLY. LOVE IT. ON THE GROUND. STUFFED. THEY SET UP FOR A FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT. PATRICK MCQUEEN TAKING THE MEASURE OF NICK CHUBB. KIRK: INTERESTING CALL WITH THE TIMEOUTS AND THE TIME. THE TIMEOUT. YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEY WOULD HAVE. HERE WE GO. AL: STAY OUT THERE. STAY OUT THERE. DOWN TO A MINUTE. KIRK: MORE CLOCK THAN THEY THINK, RIGHT? AL: YOU WOULD THINK. WHO KNOWS? IT'S FOURTH AND 1. KIRK: IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CLOCK. CALL TIMEOUT AND KICK THE FIELD MEANTIME, HE RAN THE FOOTBALL INTENTIONALLY AND LET THE CLOCK KEEP GOING. EITHER WORKS :00 OR FOURTH THE LAST TIME BY PITTSBURGH. MIKE DEC LAST TIMEOUT. AL: SO HE COULD HAVE HAD 1:20 OR SO AND NO TIMEOUTS. OR 00:42 AND ONE TIMEOUT. STRATEGY, TAKE YOUR PICK. KIRK: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS THIRD DOWN PLAY. T.J. WATT OFF THE EDGE OF THE JUST COLLAPSING. WE TALKED OFFENSE ABOUT HIM IS A GREAT PASS RUSHER. TJ MATT, HE'S ABLE TO GET DOWN AND GET INTO CHUBB KICK IF IS SO COMPLETE AS AN EDGE PLAYER. AL: THERE'S HOPKINS. HE MISSED TWO LAST WEEK AND A THIRD WHICH WAS NEGATED BY A DEFENSIVE PENALTY. THIS MIGHT BE 34 YARDS. THE KICK IS GOOD. 40 THEM MORE. WHAT A TOUGH MATCHUP. THAT'S 275 POUNDS HEADSHAKE. ABLE TO GET AROUND HIM. HERE'S THE LENGTH. THE FOOTBALL LOOSE ON THE LAST ONE. YOU KNEW MYLES GARRETT WOULD HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TONIGHT. YOU SEE THAT I -- THE EIGHT FORCED FUMBLE. WE ARE IN THE FIRST HALF. NOT QUITE THAT HALFTIME YET. HE'S FEELING AT DOWN THERE. AL: HE IS. HE IS. THE HOME OF ROCK 'N' ROLL, BABY. HE'S GOT TO SHOW SOME MOVES. DAN MOORE IS A REALLY GOOD LEFT IF YOU DON'T HAVE HELP, YOU DON'T HAVE A BACK ARE YOU NOT SPYING THE PROTECTION THAT WAY. THAT'S NO MAN'S LAND. AL: PITTSBURGH STARTS IN THE 30. FIELD GOAL RANGE. WITH ONE TIMEOUT. KIRK: IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT BOSWELL'S CAREER. THEY ARE TRYING TO GET IT TO THE 41-YARD LINE AT THE LEAST. GOT TO GET INSIDE THE 40 TO GIVE HIM A SHOT. AL: BOSWELL IS GETTING BETTER WITH AGE. DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME. KIRK: SUCH A BIG PART OF FORMULA. THIS IS HOW PITTSBURGH HAS PLAYED FOR THE MOST PART WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO G THIS IS HOW THEY PLAYED ALL THESE ONE POSSESSION GAMES. THEY ARE FIVE-TO IN ONE POSSESSION GAMES THIS YEAR. AL: WILSON IS 10-10 FOR 128 SURVEYS, THROWS. HE'S 11-11. TO THE 49 YARD LINE. KIRK: THE IDEA OF SAVING THAT TIMEOUT HERE. WILSON CALLING THE PLAY, TRYING TO GET EVERYTHING LINED UP. THE CLOCK KEEPS MOVING. AL: 24, 23. TAKING DOWN. TO THE OUTSIDE. NOT LOOKING. THE TWO OF THEM NOT ON THE SAME PAGE. THAT WAS VAN JEFFERSON. LISTED AS PROBABLE. KIRK: THEY ARE TALKING DOWN THERE WITHOUT A RECEI LOOKING. SOMETIMES YOU SEE THE WRATH COMING IN WITH A LATE GROUNDING CALL. LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO MOVE ON. AL: LOOK LIKE JEFFERSON AND MUNCIE WERE NOT ON THE SAME WILSON RETREATS. GOING DEEP. THERE'S CONTACT. IS THERE ANY FLAG? THERE IS NONE. MARK EMERSON AND GEORGE PICKENS GETTING TANGLED UP. PICKENS PLEADING HIS CASE. THEY SAY, NO. YOU HAVE 11 SECONDS. KIRK: WHAT MAKES ME NERVOUS IS WHEN A DEFENSIVE BACK DOESN'T HAVE A FEEL FOR WHERE HE IS AND WHERE THE FOOTBALL IS. WATCH EMERSON. THAT'S THE ONE ASPECT THAT MAKES YOU NERVOUS THAT A CALL COULD COME IN. AL: LITTLE ARM BAR THERE. NO FLAG. THIRD AND 10. HE IS TO GET SACKED BACK AT THE 30 YARD LINE. WHAT A SHOW HE'S PUTTING ON. THREE SACKS TONIGHT. KIRK: NOW WE'VE SEEN HIM IT ONE-ON-ONE. INSTEAD OF WORKING OUT HERE, HE WORKS TO THE INSIDE. NOW HE GETS MATCHED UP THERE AGAINST A ROOKIE ZACH THE CENTER. ZACH FRAZIER SAID, WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIS? EDGE. AL: THE CLEVELAND BROWNS SHOCKED BALTIMORE THREE WEEKS AGO. TRYING TO SHOCK PITTSBURGH 10-3. >> MYLESCHRIS BOSWELL TO KICK OF AND THE BROWNS WILL START AT THEIR 30 YARD LINE. MOMENTS STEFANSKI. KAYLEE: YOUR OFFENSE SCORED ON THOSE LAST TWO DRIVES. HOW DO YOU WANT TO CONTINUE SECOND HALF? >> THIS IS A TOUGH TEAM. IT IS AFC FOOTBALL. WE KNEW THIS WOULD BE A BATTLE. WE HAVE TO DO OUR JOB EARLY THE FIRST POSSESSIONS. WE HAD TOO MANY LITTLE MISTAKES AND YOU CANNOT DO THAT AGAINST A GOOD FOOTBALL TEAM. KAYLEE: MYLES GARRETT AS HUGE TRACTOR IN THAT FIRST HALF. T.J. WATT ESSENTIALLY NO FACTOR. HOW DO YOU CONTINUE THAT? >> I WILL WORRY ABOUT OUR A GUY IN 95. WE WILL NEED HIM TO FINISH THIS AL: CLEVELAND NOW STARTING FROM THE.30 YARD LINE WINSTON THROWS AND THE CATCH IS MADE BY JORDAN AKINS, THE NUMBER TWO TIGHT END. GAIN OF 12. KIRK: DOES HE LOOK SO WELL-PREPARED TONIGHT. THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO NEUTRALIZE T.J. WATT TONIGHT. NOT BEING EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST HALF AS FAR AS GETTING TO THE QUARTERBACK. A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH BEING CHIPPED, BEING DOUBLE-TEAMED. DIFFERENT GUYS TRYING TO ACCOUNT FOR IT. LET'S SEE WHAT TJ AND THE STEELERS CAN DO T HIM GOING IN THE SECOND HALF. AL: PICK UP OF ABOUT THREE ON THE GROUND. WE HAVEN'T EVEN MENTIONED THIS, BUT DESHAUN WATSON WAS THE QUARTERBACK, TORE HIS ACHILLES. THAT IS THE REASON WINSTON GOT THE OPPORTUNITY. KIRK: HE LOOKS GREAT. THERE IS T.J. WATT'S NUMBERS. THE 11 PASS RUSH SNAPS HE HAS HAD SO FAR. HE IS ITCHING TO GET AFTER WINSTON. WINSTON FOR THE MOST PART HAS BEEN CLEAN. HE MOVED AROUND A LITTLE BIT BUT THE LINE HAS DONE A G TAKING CARE OF HIM. AL: PLAY ACTION. UNDER PRESSURE, SCRAMBLES, THROWS ON THE RUN. CAUGHT BY TILLMAN. PICKED UP BY THE STEELERS. TILLMAN HAD THE FIRST DOWN, AND JACKSON WILL WIND UP WITH THE KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE THE SAFETY CAME UP AND KNOCKED IT OUT. PUT HIS SHOULDER RIGHT ON THE FOOTBALL, WENT UP IN THE AIR. TILLMAN IS A PHYSICAL SECOND YEAR OUT OF TENNESSEE. 6'3", 215. JUST DOESN'T TAKE CARE OF THE BALL. A HECK OF A JOB BY ELLIOTT. IT IS A CLASSIC TACKLE. HE JUST GOT HIS TO POP IT LOOSE. AL: SPUN HIM AROUND. HE IS GETTING FED ON THE SIDELINE, MAKING THAT SIGN. NOW WITH A TURNOVER. AL: FROM THE 25 YARD LINE. THE STEELERS, THEIR FIRST PLAY OF THE SECOND HALF. HARRIS CUTTING TO THE OUTSIDE. GOOD MOVE. LUNGING FORWARD, PICKS UP NINE. HE IS OUR YARD SHY OF A FIRST SECOND AND 1. KIRK: WHEN THE STEELERS COME OUT AT HALFTIME THIS YEAR, THEY COME OUT WITH REALLY WELL-ADJUSTED PLANS. THEY ARE OUTSCORING THEIR OPPONENTS BY 80 POINTS IN THE SECOND HALF. THE BUFFALO BILLS. AL: TO THE GROUND AGAIN, 80 YARD. AND NOW THE BROWNS THINK THEY CAME UP WITH THE BALL. OFFICIALS WILL COME IN. NOTHING YET. DOWN BY CONTACT. KIRK: YOU SEE RIGHT THERE, HE STILL HAS HE IS DOWN. AL: HE IS DOWN, BALL COMES OUT. TERRY MCCULLOUGH INDICATING DOWN BY CONTACT, AS BRAD ALLEN CONFIRMS. AND IT IS A FIRST DOWN. THE 37 YARD LINE. GAIN OF ONE FIRST NAJEE HARRIS. HARRIS TONIGHT CARRIED THE BALL NINE TIMES, 26 YARDS, A LITTLE LESS THAN THREE PER CARRY. KIRK: THE BROWNS ARE LIVING UP TO THEIR OPPORTUNITY BY GYM SHORTS. PUTTING AS MANY BODIES UP THERE AS THEY CAN, LEAVING THEIR CORNERS OUT IN THE ISLANDS. THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE THEIR CORNERS CAN HOLD UP. FOR THE MOST PART, THEY HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB OF NOT GETTING BEING DOWNFIELD -- GETTING BEATEN DOWN FIELD. ESPECIALLY IN EARLY DOWNS. AL: SECOND DOWN, 9. WARREN TO THE 48. YOU ARE LOOKING AT A DEFENSE HERE, THEY WERE NUMBER ONE IN THE LEAGUE LAST YEAR. FEWEST YARDS ALLOWED. THIS YEAR, 19. KIRK: DIFFERENT YEAR, TON OF INJURIES. THE TRADE OF SMITH OVER TO DETROIT. MIKE WALLACE MIKE WAL--MY CALL HAD SOME ISSUES. ALEX WRIGHT WAS OUT WITH A TORN TRICEP IN WEEK FOUR. THEY LOST THREE OF THEIR FOUR BUS PASS RUSHERS OTHER THAN MYLES GARRETT -- OF THEIR FOUR BEST PASS RUSHERS OTHER THAN AL: WILSON, THE LITTLE LOLLIPOP, AND TRYING TO KEEP HIS BALANCE IS WARREN. THAT WILL SIGNAL A FIRST DOWN. WOW. OR, OR -- KIRK: OR SHORT BY A HALF A YARD. HOW ABOUT THAT EFFORT BY THORNHILL? HE WAS IN THE MIDDLE FIELD. HE MAKES THAT PLAY, AND GET ANOTHER GREAT PLAY BY WARREN. HE GETS HIT AND HE GETS ANOTHER 4.5, FIVE YARDS. AL: A FOURTH DOWN AND 1 AND THEY GO FOR IT, AND THEY STOP HIM. TAKES HIM DOWN. WARREN STOBRAVING THE ELEMENTS. FAIRLY TOASTY UP HERE. A SNOW GLOBE IN CLEVELAND THE SNOW COMING DOWN. TEMPERATURE IS 30 DEGREES. THEY TURN IT OVER. CLEVELAND STARTS AT THE 45 YARD LOOKING FOR ROOM, PICKING UP KIRK: LET'S LOOK AT THE PLAY. THE CLEVELAND DEFENSE SOMEWHAT CONFUSED, MAKING SURE EVERYONE TRIES TO GET LINED UP AT THAT SECOND LEVEL, BUT WATCH 90. GOING BACK TO HIS DAYS PLA IN MICHIGAN. A BIT UNDERSIZED FOR THE INTERIOR, BUT THAT QUICK MOVEMENT, ESPECIALLY THAT INITIAL BURST OFF THE BALL. THAT TIME, USES HIS HANDS. LET'S SEE IF CAPITALIZE. AL: GETS WRESTLED DOWN INSIDE THE 40 YARD LINE BY HAYWARD. A VERY NOISY CAREER. PICKED NUMBER ONE IN THE FIRST ROUND OUT OF OHIO STATE. SON OF IRON HEAD HAYWARD. KIRK: THAT'S RIGHT. IT LOOKS LIKE THIS YEAR WITH HIS FIVE SACKS, SIX TACKLES FOR A LOSS, HE HAS KNOCKED DOWN FIVE PASSES THIS YEAR, IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS IN HIS LATE THE WAY HE IS PLAYING. AL: 35 YEARS OLD. THIRD DOWN AND 4. KIRK: 0-4 TONIGHT ON THIRD DOWNS. AL: CAN THEY CONVERT? NO, THEY CAN'T. TIPPED AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. THAT TIME, IT WAS -- HAYWARD. USUALLY HE IS ABLE TO GET IN THERE AND AFFECT THE QUARTERBACK BY PRESSURING. THIS TIME, THE BALL IS OUT IN A HURRY AGAINST THAT BLITZ. HE IS ABLE TO BAT THE BALL DOWN. THEY COME OUT WITH A AND ARE ABLE TO GET A THREE AND PITTSBURGH DEFENSE STEPS UP AGAIN. THE KICK WILL BOUND INTO THE END TO THE 20 YARD LINE THEY WIL COME. DOWN BY SEVEN. ROOTED IN THIS PART OF T HISTORY. WHO SHOOK UP THE SNOW GLOBE? IT IS COMING DOWN MO HOUSE ALL NIGHT RIGHT NOW. KIRK: IT LOOKS GREAT FOR BEAUTIFUL. -- IT LOOKS GREAT AL: A NICE MOVE. HE IS FORCED OUT OF BOUNDS. A GAIN OF NINE. PUSHED OUT BY RONNIE HIT AND. THE DOG POUND. I DON'T KNOW. I THINK YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR MIND. KIRK: YOU TAILGATED ALL DAY. AL: I HAVE TO MAKE A STOP AT THE CLINIC AFTER THIS. KIRK: WE ARE SITTING HERE WITH THE CLEVELAND LEAD AT 10-3 BECAUSE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS GAME, CLEVELAND HAS MISSED OPPORTUNITIES. A COUPLE TIMES IN PLUS TERRITORY. THEY TRIED THE FIELD GOAL EARLY. FOURTH AND INCHES IN THEIR OWN THEIR DEFENSE HAS BAILED THEM BUT THEIR OWN OFFENSE, YOU CAN SEE THE RESULTS. THEY HAVE TO START PUTTING THE DRIVE TOGETHER AND PUTTING POINTS ON THE BOARD. AL: NOTHING DOING HERE. THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE. TOMLINSON CAME IN, SECOND AND 10. KIRK: JIM SCHWARTZ IS MIXING UP THESE LOOKS WELL. GET OUT OF IT, PLAY SOME ZONE. THEY ARE BRACKET COVERAGE. RUSSELL WILSON RIGHT NOW SEEING THINGS THAT IS CAUSING HIM TO BE HESITANT INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THAT PASS RUSH, THAT TIME WITH TOMLINSON, TO BE ABLE TO GET HOME. AL: REALLY COMING DOWN NOW. TO THE GROUND. TO KNOW WHERE. -- TO NOWHERE. DEVIN BUSH MAKES THAT TACKLE. THE THIRD. KIRK: WE PUT A GRAPHIC UP TO SHOW YOU THE DRIVE. IF YOU ARE A STEELERS FAN, IS WRONG WITH PITTSBURGH'S OFFENSE? IT IS WHAT IS RIGHT WITH CLEVELAND'S DEFENSE TONIGHT. WE CAN POINT OUR FINGER ALL WE WANT AT PITTSBURGH. THIS IS ABOUT A CLEVELAND DEFENSE READY TO PLAY AND INCREDIBLY WELL PREPARED. AL: NUMBER ONE IN THE LEAGUE LAST YEAR, NUMBER 19 THIS YEAR, BUT THEY LOOK LIKE NUMBER ONE WILSON GOING DEEP. HE'S GOT A MAN WIDE OPEN. IT IS JEFFERSON THIS TIME. JEFFERSON GETS FREE DOWN THE SIDELINE. FORGET THE ELEMENTS. RUSSELL SAYS I WILL TAKE A SHOT KIRK: WE JUST TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY ARE CHANGING LOOKS. THEY SHOW ONE LOOK PRE-SNAP, THEN THEY CHANGE IN THE POST SNAP. HE GOES TO THE INSIDE AND STAYS ON CALVIN AUSTIN, AND THAT SLIGHT HESITATION OPENS UP THE OUTSIDE TO GET IT TO WHERE HE REALLY WANTED TO GO, TO THE JEFFERSON MAKES A HECK OF A CATCH THERE. AL: HARRIS, NO. STOPPED IN THE BACKFIELD THAT TIME. SECOND AND 12. KIRK: IF YOU ARE A STEELERS FAN, YOU KNOW THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE ALL YEAR. WHEN THEY GET TO THIS PART OF THE FIELD, THINGS SLOW DOWN. THEY ARE NOT QUITE INTO THE RED ZONE, BUT THEY ARE 30TH IN THE NFL IN THE RED ZONE. IT IS A MATTER OF STILL BEING ABLE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL AND GETTING THE BALL OUT OF THE HANDS OF RUSSELL WILSON QUICKLY. YOU DON'T WANT HIM BACK THERE HOLDING ONTO THE FOOTBALL. AL: THIRD AND 11. FLUSHED OUT. LOOKS TO THE SIDELINE. SKIRTS THAT SIDELINE AND COMES CLOSE TO PICKING UP A FIRST TACKLED JUST IN BOUNDS. KIRK: I THINK HE GOT IT THERE. AL: YES, HE KIRK: KEEP IN MIND WILSON IS 35 YEARS OLD. HE DID NOT PLAY EARLIER BECAUSE OF A CALF INJURY. THAT IS WHY FIELDS PLAYED. HERE HE IS, UNDERSTANDS EXACTLY WHERE HE NEEDS TO GO. THERE THEY MIGHT TAKE A PEEK DEFINITELY SHORT OF THE MARKER. AL: DO THEY WANT TO CHALLENGE? KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE THEY DID BRING IT BACK. THE SNOW IS FOR REAL NOW. CLEVELAND FORCING IT ON DOWNS WITH FOURTH DOWN COMING UP. KIRK: THEY ARE 0-2 O THEY HAVE NOT DONE IN THESE SHORT GUARD SITUATIONS. WHEN IT IS THESE DEFENSES, THEY HAVE TO CALL BOSWELL TO KICK IT. AL: IT WOULD BE INTO THE WIND. THIS WOULD BE 42 YARDS FOR CHRIS 41 YARDS. AND TIMEOUT IS TAKEN. KIRK: AND THE PLAY CLOCK DOWN TO FIVE SECONDS. THIS IS IMPORTANT. YOU NEED TO COME AWAY HERE WITH POINTS. YOU ARE DOWN TO UNDER FIVE MINUTES TO GO IN THE THIRD QUARTER. FIELD CONDITIONS, THE WAY YOUR OFFENSE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO FINISH THESE DRIVES, YOU HAVE GOT TO COME AW AL: WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO NOW? THERE IS DANNY SCHMIDT. LONGTIME SPECIAL TEAMS COACH, WORKING ON THAT GUM. THE OFFENSE IS GOING T BACK OUT. FOURTH DOWN AND 1. KIRK: INTERESTING, MIKE WILLIAMS HAD BEEN PLAYING A LOT TONIGHT. 18. AL: MADE A BIG CATCH A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AGAINST WASHINGTON. A PICK UP FROM THE JETS. A LONGTIME FORMER CHARGER. HERE THEY GO, FOURTH AND 1. JAYLEN WARREN IS THE BACK. PLAY CLOCK AT 4:00. WILSON TO THROW IF HE CAN. SPINS AWAY, FIRES. CAUGHT ALONG THE SIDELINE. THE TIGHT END GETS FREE, WORKED HIS WAY FREE. GARRETT THAT TIME CHASING WILSON AND HIT HIM. KIRK: NOT ONLY DID HE CHASE HIM, HE HAD A RUNNING START. AND RUSSELL WILSON KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN TO HIM. EVEN IN THE SNOW. WATCH THE RUNNING START. LOWERS THE BOOM RIGHT INTO HIS RIBS AS HE RELEASES THAT AND LOOK AT THAT, RIGHT ON THE MONEY FOR THE FIRST DOWN. THAT IS CLUTCH BY RUSSELL AL: EIGHT YARD GAIN. THE MARKINGS ARE STARTING TO GET OBSCURED HERE. HARRIS TO THE 9. KIRK: SO CLOSE TO FALLING THAT ONE OUT AND HEADING TO TH AL: TACKLE BY ISAIAH MAGUIRE. KIRK: HOLDING THAT RIGHT ANKLE. HE ALMOST SLIPPED OUT OF IT. RED ZONE AN ISSUE FOR WILL THEY COME UP WITH ANSWERS HERE? AL: THIS IS NOT A LOW HALF STADIUM, WONDERING. -- THIS IS NOT ALOHA CASE YOU WERE WONDERING. KIRK: OHIO WEATHER, BABY. I LOVE IT. AL: HIGH STEP, RECOVERS. GETS TACKLED AT THE 17 YARD THE HIGH SNAP FROM THE ROOKIE CENTER. NOTHING IS EASY RIGHT NOW. KIRK: NO. IT IS NOT A MATTER OF SNAPPING AT HIGH. IT IS THE GRIP OF THE FOOTBALL AS MUCH AS ANYTHING. RUSSELL WILSON JUST BEING AN ATHLETE, IS ABLE TO SOMEHOW COME BACK DOWN WITH IT. NOW WAY BEHIND THE STI AL: THIRD AND 13. HAS TO GET TO THE 3 FOR A FIRST WILSON IN THE BLIZZARD. THAT WILL BE CAUGHT BY PICKENS, BUT WELL SHORT OF A FIRST DOWN. EMERSON WAS COVERING ON THE PLAY. FIELD GOAL UNIT COMING OUT. KIRK: DIDN'T EVEN HESITATE. AL: FOURTH AND 7, 2:30 TO GO IN THE DIVISION LEADER LEADING THE TEAM IN THE BASEMENT. TWO AND 18. 28 YARD ATTEMPT. BOSWELL'S KICK, IF HE CAN FIND IT, IS GOOD. I LOST SIGHT OF IT. THE SERIES PREMIERING OCTOBER 26 -- DECEMBER 26 ONLY ON PRIME. WE HAVE TO PUT IN THESE VIRTUAL LINES SO YOU CAN SEE THEM. OTHERWISE, FORGET ABOUT IT. KIRK: GOOD EFFORT. AL: OUR GANG IN THE TRUCK. SNOW. AL: HELPING US OUT, THANK GOD. TO THE 8 YARD LINE. JEROME FORD. WORKS HIS WAY UP TO THE 35 YARD KAYLEE, YOU MAKING SNOW INJURES THERE? KAYLEE: I WANT TO EXPLAIN THE ADVANTAGE THE BROWNS HAVE AS THEY DRIVE DOWN THE FIELD TOWARDS THE LEFT END ZONE. RUSSELL WILSON WAS GETTING PELTED IN THE FACE WITH SNOW. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HIS VISION WAS OBSTRUCTED, BECAUSE MINE WAS AS I TRY TO WALKED ON THE BUT HERE WITH UNDER TWO MINUTES LEFT, THEY WILL SWITCH SIDES SOON, AND THE BROWNS NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS. AL: VERY SIGNIFICANT, AS THEY GO WITH THE WIND. DOWN FIELD, REACHING UP TO MAKE THE CATCH. THAT IS BLAKE WHITEHEART. SORRY ABOUT THAT. THEY JUST ACTIVATED HIM. 29 YARDS. HE WAS JUST ACTIVATED BEFORE TH KIRK: HOW ABOUT THE CALL ON FIRST AND 10? IN THESE CONDITIONS, TO COME DOWN WITH IT. WHEN UP AGAINST DONTE JACKSON. BIG ADVANTAGE WITH HIS HEIGHT. COMES DOWN WITH THAT FOOTBALL. AL: OUT OF WAKE FOREST, SECOND YEAR IN THE LEAGUE. MAKES A BIG PLAY. KIRK: NOT ONLY IS THAT A GREAT PLAY, THINK ABOUT A 10-6 GAME, UNDER A MINUTE TO GO IN THIRD QUARTER. IF NOTHING ELSE, WHAT A JOB AFFECTING FIELD POSITION HERE. WE WILL SEE IF THE BROWNS DO THIS ON THE STRIVE. THAT IS A GREAT WAY TO RESPOND FROM JAMEIS WINSTON AND THIS OFFENSE. THEY TRUST HIM RUNNING THIS OFFENSE RIGHT NOW. AL: HALF A MINUTE TO GO IN THE DROP TO THE OUTSIDE, GETS TAKEN DOWN TO THE 31. T.J. WATT, QUIET NIGHT SO FAR, MAKES THE TACKLE HERE. SETS UP A THIRD AND 5. THEY'VE GOT EVERYTHING BUT THE ZAMBONI OUT HERE RIGHT NOW. KIRK: BIG THIRD DOWN. WILL THEY RUN THE PLAY BEFORE THEY SWITCH SIDES? THEY DO. WINSTON THROWS OVER THE MIDDLE, CAUGHT. AND BREAKING THE TACKLE. TILLMAN BANGED IN. THEY WILL LINE AND UP, SEE WHETHER THEY GOT IT OR NOT. THAT IS THE WAY THE QUARTER WILL END. 10-6 HURT ON THE THEY PUT HIM IN THE BLUE TENT. KIRK: HE STAYS ON HIS FEET, TRIES TO FINISH IT. CAME CLOSE. THEY MEASURED. HE WAS FOUR OR FIVE INCHES SHORT. HE GOES INTO THE TENT. THE BROWNS OFFENSE STILL OUT ON THE FIELD. YOU ARE RIGHT, WE NEED A ZAMBONI. GET THE SHOVELS OUT. AL: CHANGING CLEATS HERE. ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME. KIRK: THE STEELERS HAVE WON TWO GAMES THIS YEAR WHERE THEY HAVE NOT SCORED A TOUCHDOWN. WEEK ONE AGAINST ATLANTA. AL: BIG FOURTH AND INCHES. JERRY JEUDY LINES UP IN THE BACKFIELD. THEY GIVE IT TO THE FULLBACK, AND OF THE FIRST MAN THROUGH WILL PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN. KIRK: THEY END A LITTLE CLOSER TO GET DOWNHILL IN A HURRY. AL: SHOPPED BEHIND HIM AS THE FULLBACK. KIRK: A LITTLE EYE CANDY THERE. THEY USED THE POWER OF WHAT HE CAN DO. GOOD BLOCKS ON THE LEFT SIDE. THE BROWNS ARE PLAYING WELL. WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO LOSE? THEY ARE 2-8. AL: NOTHING. KIRK: EXACTLY. AL: TO THE 23, OPEN. MAKING THE CATCH TO THE 5 YARD LINE, JORDAN AKINS. ON THIS DRIVE, AKINS THE NUMBER TWO TIGHT END AND WHITE HART MAKING THE BIG PLAYS. KIRK: WATCH WINSTON HIT THIS SEEM BETWEEN THE SAFETY A CORNER. GETS IT OUT QUICKLY, GIVES HIS TIGHT END A CHANCE TO NOT ONLY CATCH THE BALL BUT BE ABLE TO PROTECT HIMSELF FROM THAT HIT. JAMEIS WINSTON SINGH THE COVERAGE TONIGHT FOR PITTSBURGH EVEN IN THESE COVERAGE. AL: ON THE GROUND. CAN THEY STOP HIM? AT THE 1.5 IS NICK CHUBB, SECOND AND GOAL. KIRK: WE ARE TALKING SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 17-6 AND 13-6. AL: ESPECIALLY IN THIS WEATHER. KIRK: THE WEATHER, LATE IN THE PITTSBURGH OFFENSE IS STRUGGLING TO FINISH DRIVES. AL: THE DRIVE STARTED AT THEIR OWN 35. BOTH ELIGIBLE HERE. DOWN TO FOUR, THREE, AND THE PLAY CLOCK. GETS THE SNAP. STOPPED AT THE 1. LOUDERMILL MAKES THAT TACKLE. KIRK: THEY KEEP POUNDING THE ROCK. THEY GOT CONFIDENCE. THIS OFFENSIVE LINE HAS HELD THEIR OWN THEY GOT CONFIDENCE THEY CAN WIN UP FRONT. YOU HAVE CHUBB, WHO HAS DONE A GOOD JOB OF MOVING THE PILE. GOT A STEALER -- STEELER DOWN. AL: LANDON ROBERTS. THE INJURY STOPPAGE. THE STEELERS ARE MINUS ALEX HIGHSMITH ALREADY. NOW YOU HAVE ROBERTS DOWN. KIRK: THAT WAS A BIG COLLISION WITH THE LINEBACKER, 59. AND ROBERTS. IT TOOK HIM OUT OF THE GAME. THEY RUN THE BALL WITH CHUBB, THEY COME UP HALF A YARD SHORT, THEY ARE GOING FOR IT. THEY ARE GOING FOR THIS TOUCHDOWN. AL: YOU HAVE TO. KIRK: WORST CASE, YOU DON'T MAKE IT, YOU PIN THE OFFENSE BACK. THEY HAVE TO RUN CHUBB AND IF THEY CAN GET IT IN. AL: MAKE HIM GO 99 YARDS THEY DON'T HAVE TONY DORSETT TO DO IT. THIRD AND GOAL. CLEVELAND IS 0-6 ON THIRD HERE THEY ARE, THIRD DOWN AND FAKE, THROWS. HE HAD IT AND COULDN'T HOLD ON. SIX POINTS THERE, AND HE CAN'T BRING IT IN FOR THE GOAL. KIRK: WHAT A CALL BY DORSEY. I THINK THEY EXPECTED TO RUN THIS WITH CHUBB. THE BALL JUST THE BALL. IT GAVE HIM THE C BACK THERE AND KNOCK IT AWAY. AL: HOW IRONIC, THE NUMBER TWO AND THREE TIGHT ENDS MAKE THE BIG PLAYS ON THIS DRIVE, AND YOUR TOP TIGHT END DROPS IT. KIRK: POINTS AL: JEROME FORD IS IN THE FOURTH DOWN AND GOAL. FOUR IN MOTION. WINSTON UNDER PRESSURE. INTO THE END ZONE. WHOA. JAMEIS WINSTON. IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS GOING TO GET SACKED. 65 YARDS IN 10 PLAYS. KIRK: JAMEIS WINSTON IS LI DREAM RIGHT NOW. AL: NO DOUBT. KIRK: THIS GUY, YOU SAW HIS SMILE WHEN HE WAS TALKING TO KAYLEE IN THE PREGAME, SAID HOW BLESSED HE FEELS TO PLAY HOW FITTING ON A FOURTH DOWN THE STEELERS CAUGHT IN MAN TO MAN COVERAGE. LOOKS BEHIND HIM. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO, ESCAPES. NOBODY HAD HIM AND HE AL: 0-2, HIS FIRST RUSHING TD IN FOUR YEARS. JERRY JEUDY INSIDE. THROWS, AND THIS TIME THOUGH TWO-POINT CONVERSION. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS CRAZY. I YEAR AGO, JOE FLACCO COMES OUT OF NOWHERE, THEY WERE CHANTING WACKO, FLAK OH, FLAT GO. TONI WHAT AN INTERESTING SEQUENCE WITH JAMEIS WINSTON. LOOK AT HIS HELMET, BANG. YOU CAN SEE THE COMMUNICATION ASPECT OF HIS HELMET, POPPING OUT OF HIS HELMET. HE IS TRYING TO FIX IT, SAYING, I CAN'T HEAR YOU, I CAN'T COMMUNICATE. IT IS DANGLING IN FRONT OF HIS EYES, RIGHT IN HIS VISION. HE STILL MAKES A PERFECT THROW TO THE TIGHT END NJOKU AND THEY GET THE TWO-POINT CONVERSION TO GO UP. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THAT? THAT IS CRAZY. KIRK: NOTHING IS GOING TO STOP NUMBER FIVE TONIGHT. YOU WONDER, WHY WOULD YOU GO UP BY 12? YOU GET A TOUCHDOWN AND A TWO POINTER AND THEY STILL HAVE THAT 12 POINT LEAD. AL: THEY HAVE TO GET TWO TOUCHDOWNS. DROPPED FROM THE 5. PATTERSON TO THE 32 YARD LINE. KAYLEE: IT TURNS OUT WHAT YOU SAW POP OUT OF JAMEIS'S HOME IT WAS THE BATTERY TO THE COMMUNE ACACIAN DEVICE, BUT IT STAYED ATTACHED. I AM TOLD BY THE BROWNS STAFF THAT HE MAINTAIN HIS ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE THE ENTIRE TIME. BUT THEY DID POP IT BACK THE HELMET IS GOOD TO GO. KIRK: WHAT A STORY WITH JAMEIS. WE HAVE SEEN OTHER QUARTERBACKS WASH OUT. THEY ARE DONE, THEY ARE BACKUPS, AND THEY RESURFACE. BAKER HAS DONE THAT, FLACCO HAS DONE THAT. WE HAVE SEEN SAM DARNOLD IN MINNESOTA. AL: THE THROW HERE. FOUR-YARD GAIN. DARNELL WASHINGTON. SECOND AND 6. KIRK: WHO BETTER THAN MYLES GARRETT? WHAT HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO. YOU TALK ABOUT RELIABILITY. HE CAME INTO THIS GAME FEELING THREATENED AND CHALLENGED. HE DIDN'T REALLY CARE. HE SEEMED LOCKED IN. ANY TIME HE GOES UP AGAINST THE STEELERS, AGAINST T.J. WATT, HE WANTS TO TAKE LEVEL. THE BROWNS DEFENSE. AL: FIELD NOW IN THE GAME. WE SAW HIM EARLIER. THEY GO TO JUSTIN FIELDS. HE WILL KEEP IT. DOWN THE SIDELINE HE GOES BEFORE HE IS RUSHED OUT OF BOUNDS. OFF THE BLOCK FROM CONNOR HEYWARD. THEY BRING HIM IN FOR A SPECIAL PLAY FROM A SPECIAL PACKAGE HE GETS 30. KIRK: TYSON HILL GAVE THEM AN ISSUE WITH DEFENSE. STAYS IN BOUNDS AND PICKS UP SOME HUGE YARDS. I TALKED TO JIM SCHWARTZ ABOUT THAT THIS WEEK AND HE TALKED ABOUT WE PREPPED, AND EVEN IN A SHORT WEEK, WE KNOW THAT FEELS WILL COME IN THERE. YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR THOSE LOOKS AND SET THAT EDGE. THAT TIME HE GOT BIG BLOCK. AL: THEY RUN INTO EACH OTHER. FIELD STAYS IN HERE. HE GOES INTO THE BENCH. DEVIN BUSH TAKES CARE OF HIM WHO IS COMING INTO THE GAME, WILSON OR FIELDS? KIRK: FIELDS WILL STAY IN THE GAME, IT LOOKS LIKE. WHETHER ANYBODY HAS WATCHED HIM PLAY, OBVIOUSLY HE RIGHT NOW, RUSSELL WILSON THROWING THE MORE T STYLE OFFENSE. BUT DON'T BE SURPRISED TO SEE HIM AT ANY POINT PULL THIS BALL BACK AND TRY TO FIND A RECEIVER TO MAKE THE PLAY. THE DEFENSE CHANGES THEIR SCHEME. AL: SECOND DOWN AND 12. SNAPPED A LITTLE HIGH. THEY GOT JORDAN HICKS COMING IN AND A FLAG, PERSONAL FILE. KIRK: HE LANDED ON HIM WITH ALL HIS WEIGHT ON THE FOLLOW-THROUGH, ONCE HE HIT HIM AFTER THE THROW. THIS ONE OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS, SOMETIMES THEY GET CONFUSED, BUT IT IS WATCHING HIM DRIVE INTO THE GROUND. >> HE HAS TO BRACE, HE HAS TO GET TO THE SIDE. PUNISHES THEM WITH A SHOULDER. CLEARLY A BODYWEIGHT FOUL. AL: NOW RUSSELL WILSON IS BACK IN. TOUGH TO STOP WHEN YOU'RE COMING IN ON SKATES. 10 MINUTES TO PLAY IN REGULATION. FROM THE 22. SHELBY HARRIS MAKES THE STOP. UNDER 10 MINUTES TO PLAY, 18-6 KIRK: NOT TO SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD, BUT THE RED ZONE AREA, THE PLUS TERRITORY FOR GUYS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM. RUSSELL WILSON HAS BEEN PLAYING WELL. DIDN'T YOU FEEL THAT WINFIELD WAS IN THERE, HE GIVE THEM A LITTLE SPARK, HE GIVE THEM A LITTLE SOMETHING? THE THREAT GETTING THE FOOTBALL. AL: THEY HAVE HAD SEVEN QUARTERS WITHOUT A TOUCHDOWN. NOW YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE JUMP. >> NEUTRAL ZONE INFRACTION, DEFENSE, NUMBER 54. FIVE YARD PENALTY, SECOND DOWN. AL: COMING ACROSS THE LINE, TURNING A SECOND AND EIGHT AND TO A SECOND AND 3. KIRK: KIND OF A NO-BRAINER. WHO CAN HELP RUSSELL WILSON OUT IN THE PAST GAME? WHO CAN WIN ONE-ON-ONE HERE? PICKENS DOWN, ISOLATED ONE-ON-ONE AGAINST EMERSON. AL: MAYBE AL: MA WILL SOME THROWS. HERE IS HARRIS -- WILSON THROWS. HERE IS HARRIS. HARRIS DIVES FORWARD FOR KIRK: HOW BIG IS THAT TWO-POINT CONVERSION THAT HE HAD WITH BATTERY HANGING OUT OVER HIS FACE? ENDED UP GOING UP BY 12. INSTEAD OF LET'S GO AND BE SAFE, KICK THE EXTRA POINT, THE DECISION TO GO FOR TWO TO 12 IS BIG. AL: THEY NEED TWO TOUCHDOWNS. OTHERWISE, YOU HIT ONE FIELD GOAL AND A TWO-POINT CONVERSION WITH A TD. FIRST AND GOAL. WARREN FLANKING WILSON. INSTEAD, THEY GIV PATTERSON. COMING AROUND THE CORNER. NOWHERE. DEVIN BUSH IS SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. KIRK: BOY, DID DEVIN BUSH FEEL THIS THE ENTIRE WAY. INSTEAD OF READING THESE GUYS WHO ARE HOLDING, HE IS RIGHT HERE AND HE DOES A GOOD JOB OF USING HIS EYES AND TRUSTING IT AND BEING ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THE BLOCK FOR THE TIGHT END. GOOD INSTINCTS, GOOD FEEL, DISCIPLINED STAYING HOME AND A GOOD JOB FIGHTING TO THE BLOCK TO FINISH THE PLAY. MEANWHILE, WINSTON IS ON THAT SAME TOUR RIGHT NOW IN A WAY. NOT THAT THE TEAMS FORGOT ABOUT HIM. >> Referee: HOLDING DEFENSE NUMBER 24. 5-YARD PENALTY, AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. >> Al: THERE'S AN FOR WINSTON, WHAT'S >> Kirk: RIGHT NOW HE'S STANDING OVER THERE ON THE SIDELINE. >> Al: DORIAN THOMPSON HE COMES BACK IN THE GAME, WHICH IS A SURPRISE. >> Kirk: AND HE'S KIND OF THEIR VERSION OF JUSTIN AS A CHANGE-UP AND WHAT HE CAN DO. LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT? WHAT HE GOT IS A HAND-OFF HERE TO PICKS UP ABOUT 3. SO DORIAN THOMPSON AND WATSON. WHEN WATSON TORE HIS ACHILLES, THOMPSON AND ROBINSON STARTED THAT GAME AND WINSTON THE NEXT GAME. SO HE COMES OUT FOR ONE PLAY, AND HE GOES. >> Kirk: HE IS A THREAT. HE CAN THROW IT ALSO BUT ALSO GOT THAT ABILITY TO PULL THE BALL AND GET AROUND THE EDGE THE WAY FIELDS CAN. THE WAY WINSTON HAS BEEN THROWING THE FOOTBALL, DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB MAKING DECISIONS. LOOK AT THEIR COVERAGE, A LITTLE BIT >> Al: NO PLAY. >> Kirk: LEFT TACKLE LOOKED LIKE HE MOVE. REMEMBER HE GAVE UP A SACK AND THIS TIME HE MOVES. >> Al: TAKING THE PLACE OF THE INJURED KAYLEE? >> HE WENT IN WITH AN ATHLETIC TRAINER FOR A MINUTE AND IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE THE SPECIALIST JOINED HIM THAT SPECIAL LEFT, AND IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE HEADED TO THE MONITOR. HUGE NIGHT, THREE SACKS IN THE FIRST HALF. WATTS BEEN CHECK TONIGHT. PRESSURED. ON THE RUN. THROWS! LEAPING GRAB AT THE 40 YARD LINE, JERRY JEUDY! STANDS TO PLAY, JEUDY HE GOT HIT. >> Kirk: YEAH, HE GOT HIT AFTER HE THREW HOW DID HE GET THIS BALL OVER TOP OF THIS COVERAGE? WE CAN BARELY SEE HIM. HOW DOES HE LOCATE JEUDY AND MAKE THIS THROW UP AND OVER THAT DEFENDER? >> Al: SONAR. >> Kirk: THAT WA INCREDIBLE. ON THE RUN, OVER ELLIOTT AND IN THE HANDS OF JEUDY ON THAT THIRD DOWN-PLAY. AND THEN TAKES A HIT ON -- WELL, NOT TOO MUCH OF >> Al: SLOW GETTING UP. FROM THE 39, OFF THE FAKE, ROLLING THE OTHER WAY. THROWS INTO TRAFFIC, AND THAT'S INCOMPLETE. TRYING TO GET IT TO NJOKU WAS ALSO IN AREA. 2nd AND 10. >> Kirk: JUST WHEN YOU THINK JAMEIS WINSTON AND THE BROWNS, SAME OLD BROWNS, STEELERS GOING TO FIND A WAY TO WIN AND THE BROWNS ARE JAMEIS WINSTON SAYS NOT SO FAST MY FRIEND WITH THAT COMPLETION, GETS INTO PLAUS >> Al: NOT SO FAST. THROWS, BROKEN UP. THAT TIME NJOKU COMES ON THE PLAY. KNOCKED AWAY BY BEANIE BISHOP. >> Kirk: I DON'T KNOW IF HE COULDN'T SEE ONE THING WITH JAMEIS WINSTON, HE GETS ON ROLL, HE'S A GUNSLINGER, GOING TO TAKE SOME CHANCES. VERY GOOD INTERCEPTING >> Al: 3rd AND 10. GOOD PROTECTION. THROWS, INTERCEPTED AT THE 21 YARD LINE! THEY PICK THEM OFF. DONTE >> Kirk: WELL, WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF GOOD DECISIONS TONIGHT BY JAMEIS WINSTON, AND HERE HE TRIES TO GET THIS FOOTBALL INTO AGAIN, YOU'VE GOT TOUGH CONDITIONS. BUT RIGHT BEFORE HE THROWS THIS, LOOK WHERE THE RECEIVER IS AND LOOK WHERE FOOTBALL ENDS UP GOING TO THE OUTSIDE RIGHT TO THE DEFENDER. SO YOU BREAK INTO THE RECEIVER. THE BALL IS THROWN MORE TO THE OUTSIDE WHERE DONTE JACKSON HAS OUTSIDE LEVERAGE. YOU CAN EVEN SEE THE WAY THE FOOTBALL CAME DON'T KNOW IF IT SLIPPED OUT OF HIS HAND, BUT IT DID NOT LOOK LIKE THE THROW HE MADE TONIGHT WHERE IT'S BEEN DECISIVE AND THE BALL'S COME OUT AND IT'S BEEN ON A THAT ONE KIND OF SLOPPY AND BOUNCED TO THE OUTSIDE ON HIM. COMES INTO PLAY RIGHT NOW WITH YOUR TIMEOUT USAGE. THEY HAVE ALL THREE. TO THE 27 YARD LINE HE GOES HERE. 2nd DOWN AND 7. WAY TO GO. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR NEXT GEN STATS POWERED BY AWS. WE TALKED ABOUT HIS VERTICAL PASSING GAME, WHAT HE'S KNOWN FOR HOSE MOON SHOTS. HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF MOON SHOTS. 4-6 FOR PASSES THROWN 20 YARDS OR FURTHER. GOOD JOB DEALING WITH FIELDS NOW INTO THE GAME WITH THE TO RUN IT. JUST WANT TO STAY INBOUNDS AND TRY TO PICK UP FIRST DOWNS. >> Al: AND GARRET OUT AT THE 10 AND HE'S IN THE GAME. 2nd AND 7. BIG THIRD DOWN HERE, BECAUSE IF THEY PICK UP A FIRST DOWN, YOU'VE GOT TO START THINKING OF USING YOUR TIMEOUTS, AND THEY'RE GOING TO USE ONE HERE. WITH 3:32 IT'S GOING TO BE 3rd DOWN AND >> Kirk: I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT JUSTIN YOU KNOW HOW MUCH PRACTICE TIME IT PUTS ON KEVIN STEFANSKI AND ANY TEAM THAT GETS READY TO PLAY THE STEELERS. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY IT'S Z YOU'VE GOT TO SPEND SO MUCH TIME, AND HE MAY NEVER EVEN GET THE FAME. IT TAKES AWAY THE T YOU CAN SPEND ON RUSSELL WILSON AND THE NORMAL OFFENSE THEY'RE ATTACKING YOU WITH BECAUSE OF THE THREAT OF THE ZONE READ GAME, POWER READ GAME, QB RUN GAME. IT'S A NICE WRINKLE NOT FOR TONIGHT BUT THE REST OF THE WAY. >> Al: YOU'VE GOT TWO QUARTERBACKS, ONE IN 1A, 3rd AND 4. FIELDS STAYS IN. HARRIS NEXT TO HIM. FIELDS IS GOING TO THROW AND THROW LONG! AND IT'S INCOMPLETE. INTENDED FOR P PICKENS GOING WILD, WANTED THE EMERSON COVERING HIM ON THE PLAY, AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHA CLEVELAND WAS PRAYING FOR. THEY STOP HIM AND STOP THE CLOCK TH >> Kirk: THIS IS MART OF WHAT YOU GET COVERAGE WISE WHEN YOU HAVE AN ATHLETIC QUARTERBACK IN THERE. IT'S JUST ONE-ON-ONE. EMERSON IS RUNNING AIMLESSLY, BUT IT DIDN'T REALLY AFFECT HIM ON HIS R >> Al: MEANWHILE A CATCH HERE. IT'S A SHORT ONE. IT'S WAITMAN. CAN'T EVEN TELL, DID SOMEONE GET A HAND ON IT? >> Kirk: I THINK HE SHANKED IT. HE DID NOT HIT THAT GOOD AT ALL. IT CAME OFF THE SIDE OF HIS FOOT. >> Al: WE SAW A 12-YARD CAUGHT BEFORE FROM BOJORQUEZ, AND THIS ONE ON WHAT WAS A 4th AND SPOTTED IN PITTSBURGH TERRITORY, WE THINK. >> Kirk: YEAH, THAT'S JUST CAME OFF THE INSIDE OF HIS FOOT. NOBODY GOT A HAND ON JUST MISSED IT. THINK ABOUT THIS, THIS STEELERS TEAM WINS GAMES LIKE THIS AGAIN WITH SPECIAL TEAMS BEING A BIG PART OF THE EQUATION. AND HERE WITH THE GAME ON THE LINE, YOU NEED A BIG WANT. YOU SHANK ONE, AND NOW JAMEIS WINSTON A CHANCE TO BOUNCE BACK FROM THAT INTERCEPTION TO JACKSON. >> Al: THAT WAS A 15-YARD PUNT. AT THE 45. CLEVELAND NOW. THROUGH THE MIDDLE. A GAIN OF 7. >> Kirk: YOU WERE SAYING AT THE BREAK DUSTIN HOPKINS AT THE WEEK HE HAD LAST WEEK, REALLY THE YEAR HE'S HAD, COULD THIS GAME POTENTIALLY COME DOWN TO HIS LEGS. HE'S A GREAT KICKER, HE'S JUST HAD A TOUGH TIME ESPECIALLY LAST >> Al: WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT PRETTY UNDER 3 MINUTES TO GO. HOPKINS GETTING LOOSE ON THE SIDELINE. 2nd AND 4. CLEVELAND A TWO TIMEOUTS. AND A 2-MINUTE WARNING. WINSTON HAVING TROUBLE, WINSTON HANGS IN THERE, THROWS, DROPPED. THAT IS MANNED. AKINS COULDN'T HOLD ON. 3rd AND 4. >> Kirk: STEELERS HERE MAKING A BLUNDER. QUEEN AND ELLIOTT BOTH TAKING NJOKU. NJOKU WORKS HERE AND YOU'VE GOT TWO DEFENDERS THAT GO WITH HIM, SO YOU'VE GOT NOBODY ON THE OTHER TIGHT END. HE'S ALL ALONE. NOBODY HAS IT. LOOK AT THE ROOM TO RUN IF HE CATCHES THAT NOBODY TOOK AKINS. >> Al: LOOKED LIKE HE ALMOST JUMPED A LITTLE EARLY, TOO. 3rd DOWN AND 4. 0-8 ARE THE BROWNS ON DeSHON ELLIOTT, FOURTH >> Kirk: THIS IS -- THIS IS WHERE, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE THE PLAY, KEN DORSEY'S HELD ONTO THE PLAY YOU FEEL BASED THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET THAT GOING TO GET BACK OUT AND IF IT'S MANNED COVERAGE MAYBE CROSSES, RUSH ROUTES UNDERNEATH, MAYBE TRY TO PICK. >> Al: 3 FOR 3 ON HERE THEY ARE AGAIN. >> Kirk: IT'S BEEN QUIET NIGHT FOR THIS MAN BECAUSE OF THE DOUBLE-TEAM, BECAUSE OF THE CHIPS. >> Al: AGAIN, PASS IS A LITTLE LOW. THAT'S CAUGHT. JERRY JEUDY WAS RIGHT >> Kirk: WHAT A JOB. WE JUST SAID USE THE KICK, USE A ANYTHING YOU CAN DO. THAT'S WHAT JEUDY USES WITH NJOKU. MANNED COVERAGE, AND WATCH HOW HE USES THE BIG FELLA ALMOST INSTEAD JUST OF SCREEN, GET IN FRONT OF HIM, USE THE BIG MAN TO HELP HIM OUT, GET THE FIRST DOWN. >> Al: PASS TO THE OUTSIDE HERE, AND THAT'LL BE CAUGHT BY JORDAN AKINS. AND THAT WILL MAKE 2nd DOWN. THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO GO WITHOUT A HUDDLE, BUT THEY STOP >> Kirk: HOW ABOUT HIM NOT ONLY MAKING THE CATCH BUT STAYING INBOUNDS? I MEAN EVERY YARD COUNTS RIGHT NOW, RIGHT? AND JUST GETTING CLOSER TO THIS FIELD GOAL FOR HOPKINS. >> Al: INSIDE 5 MINUTES. STOPPED AT 2:05 AS HE WENT OUT OF BOUNDS. 2nd DOWN AND 2. NEEDING 2, GETTI KNOWS? >> Kirk: HE'S BEEN PRETTY GOOD EVEN THIS YEAR IN THAT 40 TO 49 RANGE. THIS YEAR BEYOND 50 IS WHERE HE'S >> Al: NOTHING IS FOR CERTAIN RIGHT NOW. THAT PICTURE SAYS IT ALL. >> Kirk: THE SNAP ALONE, RIGHT? >> Al: 3rd DOWN AND 2. 0 FOR 9 ON THIRD DOWN. CAN THEY CONVERT HERE? LOOK OUT, UNDER FIRES, AND THAT IS INCOMPLETE THAT TIME. THAT TIME QUEEN HAD A FREE SHOT AT HIM. SO IT'S 4th DOWN AND 2. >> Kirk: YEAH, REALLY GOOD DEFENSE HERE. THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. DID WINSTON JUST TRY TO GET RID OF THE FOOTBALL? THERE WEREN'T ANY RECEIVERS ANYWHERE THERE WERE JUST OFFENSIVE LINEMEN. CAN YOU IMAGINE THIS WAS INTENTIONAL GROUNDING AND THEY MOVE THIS >> Al: TAKE THEM OUT OF FIELD GOAL RANGE. THIS WEATHER YOU'RE ON THE CUSP. YOU'RE 43-YARD FIELD GOAL, WHICH WOULD BE A 58-YARD FIELD GOAL IF THEY CALL AN INTENTIONAL GROUNDING. SO HERE WE ARE. MAKE THE CALL. CROWD, OF COURSE, IS ALREADY MAKING THE THE OFFICIAL WORD. >> Kirk: YEAH, THERE'S NO RECEIVER IN THE THE BALL DIDN'T EVEN GET PAST THE LINE OF >> Al: A LITTLE ASSIST FROM UPSTAIRS. ALL RIGHT, TERRY, YOU WANT TO WEIGH IN >> YEAH, HE'S CERTAINLY IN THE POCKET. THERE'S NO RECEIVE THE ONLY ISSUE WOULD BE IT LOOKS LIKE HE STARTS HIS MOTION -- >> Referee: ILLEGAL TOUCHING OF A PASS OFFENSE NUMBER 55. IT'S A 5-YARD PEN REMAINS THIRD DOWN. >> Kirk: SO YOU'RE SAYING HE GOT HIT AS HE WAS STARTING TO THROW THE FOOTBALL? >>> EXACTLY, THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT BUT APPARENTLY A LINEMEN INTENTIONALLY TOUCHED THE FOOTBALL, TOUCHED THE PASS, WHICH IS A 5-YARD PENALTY. >> Al: EVEN CLOSER. >> Kirk: IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERESTING TO SEE WHERE THAT BALL WOULD HAVE GUN IF HE HADN'T BEEN HIT. BUT ANYWAY THEY WAVE IT OFF. >> Al: MEANWHILE, BRAD ALLEN COMING OVER TO THE SIDELINE HERE. FOR THE MOMENT THEY HAVE AT IT AT THE 25, BUT HE SAID A 5-YARD HE'S TALKING TO TOMLIN. SO THE ORIGINAL SCRIMMAGE WAS THE 25. GOING TO BE 4th DOWN. WHERE'S THE BALL? ANNOUNCED THAT PITTSBURGH DECLINED THE PENALTY. >> Al: 4th DOWN. SO 4th AND 2. THEY'RE BASICALLY SAYING, ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT TO TRY A 43 YARD FIELD GOAL OR ARE YOU GOING TO GO FOR IT, AND THEY'RE GOING TO GO FOR IT. MEANWHILE, HOPKINS >> Kirk: AM I MISSING YOU GOT A CHANCE TO WIN THE GAME, RIGHT? I GUESS IT JUST TELLS YOU ABOUT THE CONDITIONS. >> Al: WELL, YOU STILL HAVE 1:55. AND PITTSBURGH -- THERE'S A LOT GOING O NOW THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE IT BACK. SO ORIGINALLY DECLINED, AND IT'S A 5-YARD PENALTY. HANG WITH US, GANG. WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. >> Kirk: THEY DECLINED IT, AND AFTER TALKING THEY PUSH THEM BACK. >> Al: TO THE 30. SO YOUR 5-YARD IT'S STILL THIRD DOWN. AND 3rd DOWN AND 7. READY FOR PLAY. NOT READY FOR PLAY. >> Referee: TIME OUT IT'LL BE 30 SECONDS. >> Al: WHEELS THEY ARE SPINNING, AS KEITH JACKSON MIGHT SAY. TERRY, THERE WAS A ON IT FIELD. WHAT WAS THE END RESULT? >> YEAH, ORIGINALLY THEY DECLINED THE PENALTY AND THEN THEY WENT THROUGH ALL OF THE OPTIONS. IT'S NOT A LOS THEY DECIDED TO ACCEPT THE 5-YARD PENALTY AND REPEAT THE GAME. >> Al: OKAY. SO HOPKINS STILL ON THE SIDELINE. BALL AT THE 30. SNOW HAS BARELY ABATED. 3rd AND 7. IN THE POCKET. HAS A MAN! TO THE 13 YARD LINE, JERRY JEUDY HAS SOME SIX TACKLES, 87 YARDS FOR HIM. HERE WITH MANNED LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A FLAG THAT COMES IN LATE. JOEY PORTER PASSES IT OFF TO MINKAH FITZ PATRICK. MISCOMMUNICATION BY BUT A GREAT BALL THERE BY JAMEIS TO GIVE A CHANCE. >> Al: PENALTY ON THE OH, MAN, BISHOP HITS JEUDY. SO ITS A 1st AND GOAL. GO BACK AND LOOK AT THAT PLAY IN A SECOND. NOT SURE THEY TOUCHED HIM DOWN. >> Kirk: IF THEY DID IT WAS WITH A LEG. >> Al: BARELY. HERE GOES. JUST BREAKING TACKLES! TO THE 1 YARD LINE HE GOES. >> Kirk: NOW OF COURSE CLEVELAND IN NOT ANY HURRY AT ALL PITTSBURGH BECAUSE THEY USED THAT TIMEOUT BECAUSE THEY HAD A LATE SUBSSTATITUTION AND JUST A FEW PLAYS AGO THEY'RE DOWN TO ONE TIMEOUT. >> Al: AND OBVIOUSLY IF CLEVELAND GETS A TOUCHDOWN -- SECONDS TICKING DOWN. WINSTON FROM THE GUN. TO THE END ZONE GOES TOUCHDOWN BROWNS. LOOK AT THIS CROWD! NOBODY'S LEFT. >> Kirk: BROWNS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO GO FOR 2 HERE. I'VE FELT THE PAIN OF THE BROWNS FANS. MY FIRST THOUGHT, 57 SECONDS EVEN IF THEY GO FOR 2 HERE, YOU'RE GOING TO GET RUSSELL WILSON WITH A TIMEOUT, PLENTY OF TIME TO WORK >> Al: THEY'LL HAVE ONE TIMEOUT. THEY'LL HAVE WHATEVER'S LEFT OF THE CLOCK. AS FOR THE KICK THEY GO FOR 2 TO TRY TO MAKE IT A 7-POINT WELL, YOU'VE GOT CHUBB LINED UP IN THE BACKFIELD AS THE TAILBACK. >> Referee: FALSE START OFFENSE NUMBER 59. >> Kirk: SO HARD TO DO THE COUNT DOWN IN >> Al: WIN STON REED IS THE DEFENSIVE PLAYER. THEY PUT HIM DOWN AS THE FULL BACK. AND HE FLINCHES. NOW YOU'RE IN THE SAME SITUATION BASICALLY EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE MOVING IT BACK. >> Kirk: YEAH, CHANGE OF PERSONNEL GROUPINGS, GIVE IT A BIT MORE SPREAD LOOK. >> Al: STILL NEED 2 TO MAKE IT 7. CHUBB COMES OUT. JEUDY'S HAD BIG, BIG MONEY. HE'S WIDE RIGHT. NOW HE GOES INTO MOTION. HE GETS STACKED ON THE LEFT SIDE. WINSTON THROWING TOWARDS JEUDY. BROKEN UP. ELLIOTT IN THE END WHAT A CRAZY GAME. >> Kirk: RUSSELL WILSON'S GOT 57 SECONDS AND A TIMEOUT. YOU KNOW THIS BALL IS GOING ACROSS MIDFIELD AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE HOLDING ON FOR DEAR LIFE TO SEE HOW THIS THING'S GOING TO END. WHAT A JOB WINSTON AND JEUDY AND DONE THIS JEUDY HAD SUCH A GREAT DID HE TOUCH HIM WITH HIS LEFT LEG? LOOKED LIKE HE MAYBE DID. >> Al: THIS IS TOO MUCH FUN. >> Kirk: MAN, IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE 24 IN A BROWNS UNIFORM RUNNING HARD AFTER EVERYTHING HE'S BEEN THROUGH, THE REHAB HAT HE WORKED SO HARD FOR 14 MONTHS TO GET BACK IN AND SCORES TWO TOUCHDOWNS THERE'S A 2-POINTER, UNABLE TO COME UP WITH BUT THEY STILL HAVE THE 5-POINT LEAD. >> Al: CHUBB'S AVERAGING LESS THAN 3 YARDS A CARRY, STILL THOSE BIG TDs. THREE SACKS FOR GARRET IN THE FIRST HALF. SO WHAT MAGIC REMAINS? WILSON'S HAD A GREAT NIGHT, 18-22 FOR 240. TALKED ABOUT LAST TIME WE WERE HERE JOE FLACKO CAME OUT OF RETIREMENT TO LEAD THEM TO THE PLAYOFFS IN A WIN OVER THE JETS ON A THURSDAY NIGHT. THIS YEAR IT'S JAMEIS WINSTON, AGAIN, WITH WASHINGTON GETTING HURT. COULD BE ONE OF THE BIG HEROES TONIGHT IF FAY HOLD ON. THIS IS WHEN THE ANNOUNCER WILL SAY THANK YOU FOR COMING AND DRIVE CAREFULLY ON YOUR WAY HOME TONIGHT, AND HE'LL MEAN IT. HOPKINS. RETURNABLE FROM THE 10. JAYLEN WARREN. AND HE WILL WORK HIS WAY BACK OUT TO THE ABOUT THE 35. MEANWHILE, WE CAN TELL YOU RIGHT AFTER THE GAME THE JC PENNEY POSTGAME SHOW WITH CHARISSA AND THE GANG EXCLUSIVELY ON PRIME VIDEO. KAYLEE WITH THE STAR OF THE GAME. A LOT OF STUFF TO TALK ABOUT TONIGHT. A LOT OF STUFF. >> Kirk: BUT WHAT'S GREAT HERE IN THESE LAST 50 SECONDS IS YOU'VE GOT A QUARTERBACK LIKE RUSSELL WILSON. HE KNOWS WHERE HE WANTS TO A FIND A MATCHUP. SO YOU'VE GOT MYLES GARRET WHO'S GOING TO BE IN A SPRINTER STANCE TO TRY TO GET AFTER HIM. HE'S ALREADY HAD A BIG NIGHT WITH A NUMBER OF SACKS. WHAT CAN PITTSBURGH DO? BACK THERE LOOKS LIKE TO TRY TO HELP DAN MOORE OUT ON THAT LEFT >> Al: CAN HE GO 54 YARDS IN 60 SECONDS. RUSHED AND AT THE 38 SHOULD BE A FIRST DOWN OR CLOSE TO IT. WILSON, AGAIN, BEEN IN THESE SITUATIONS A MILLION TIMES. REALIZES THE URGENCY. >> Al: TRY TO GET IN POSITION TO THROW A HAIL MARY IF NOTHING ELSE. ON THE MOVE. WARREN THE INTENDED RECEIVER IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING. ISAIAH McGUIRE PUT THE HEAT ON. >> Kirk: NOBODY WORKED WITH HIM. HE WAS RUNNING THAT TIME AND LOOKED LIKE PICKENS WAS JUST KIND OF STOPPED ONCE HE SAW SCRAMBLING. SO NOBODY HELPING HIM ON THAT SCRAMBLE. ALL HE COULD DO WAS THROW IT AWAY. >> Al: STILL 3rd AND 1. ONE SECOND MORE BACK ON THE CLOCK. IT'S AT THE 23. A JUMP PASS. WARREN, AND NOW THEY HAVE TO TAKE A TIMEOUT WITH 16 SECONDS. HE GETS THE FIRST >> Referee: TIMEOUT THEIR THIRD AND FINAL. >> Al: 30-SECOND SCHWARTZ'S DEFENSE, CAN THEY HOLD? >> Kirk: YOU HAVE 16 SECONDS AND OBVIOUSLY PICKENS IS YOUR MAIN VERTICAL THREAT YOU SAW CALVIN AUSTIN MAKE A PLAY AS WELL. MIKE WILLIAMS, WHO'S NOT 100% A FEW WEEKS AGO AGAINST THE COMMANDERS MADE A CATCH LATE. HE'S COMING OFF FIELD RIGHT NOW. BUT THE BIG THING IS I DON'T KNOW IF I GO INTO HAIL MARY MODE RIGHT NOW. I STILL THINK WITH VETERAN QUARTERBACKS LIKE THIS, YOU GET A CROSSER, SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN PICK UP 10 TO 20 YARDS NEAR THE BOUNDARY TO GET OUT OF BOUNDS OR GET UP TO THE BALL AND SPIKE IT INTO THE GROUND. >> Al: REAL QUICKLY. WITH 16 YOU CAN DO EITHER. SO THE BALL IS AT THE 44 OF THE BROWNS. YOU'VE GOT THREE RECEIVERS TO THE RIGHT WILSON DANCING, THROWS THAT ONE AWAY. NOW YOU'VE GOT 10 SECONDS. NOW YOU'RE REALLY COMPELLED TO GET THE GUY OUT OF BOUNDS OR DO YOUR HAIL MARY ACT RIGHT HERE. RUSHING 4, AND BEING ABLE TO GET THAT KIND OF PRESSURE ON A QUARTERBACK IN THIS MOMENT IN THE GAME. YOU WOULD THINK RUSHING FORWARD, HE'D BE BACK THERE IN ALL KINDS OF TIME ESPECIALLY IN THESE MYLES GARRET WITH A SPIN MOVE GOT INTO IT. >> Al: 10 SECONDS, WHISTLES. >> Al: YEAH, TIMEOUT >> Kirk: WHAT WAS THAT YEAR? 2012, THE MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL THE HAIL MARY AGAINST THE PACKERS. >> Al: RUSSELL'S BEEN INVOLVED IN SOME -- BUT A GREAT CAREER. WHAT'S HE GOT IN STORE TONIGHT? NEXT WEEK FRIDAY, RAIDERS, CHIEFS ON DAY GAME, 3:00 EASTERN, NOON PACIFIC. LOOKING TO GET HIS SAFETIES OBVIOUSLY WAY HE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO RUSH THE 4. RODNEY McLEOD IS BACK DEEP. >> Al: FOUR-MAN RUSH WILSON HAS TO GO OUT AND THAT IS CAUGHT. SO AUSTIN MAKES THAT CATCH. NOW YOU HAVE 6 >> Kirk: THAT TOOK 4 SECONDS, SO IF CLEVELAND PLAYS THE SAME TYPE OF DEFENSE, YOU COULD THEORETICALLY TRY TO RUN SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THAT. TRY TO GET MAYBE ANOTHER 8 TO 10 YARDS. THEY DID IT IN 4 >> Al: YEAH, THEY COULD. 3rd AND 1. 6 SECONDS. >> Kirk: CLEVELAND GOING TO CALL ANOTHER >> Referee: THIRD TIMEOUT, CLEVELAND, 30 SECONDS. >> Al: MOVE JORDAN HICKS INTO A SPOT AROUND 8 YARDS THE SAFETY IS VERY SO THE CLEVELAND BROWNS TRY TO BECOME GIANT KILLERS, BEAT BALTIMORE. JOHN HARBAUGH AND COMPANY I'M SURE. >> Kirk: EVERY GAME, ONE POSSESSION YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. THESE TEAMS SO CLOSE. IT'S WHO CAN PLAY CONSISTENTLY. THAT'S WHAT SEPARATES THESE TEAMS. >> Al: EVERYONE KNOWS NOTHING. RUSH THREE, DROP EIGHT, NOW A LATE RUSH. THROWING UP FOR GRABS IN THE END ZONE. HOW DOES THIS ONE END? RIGHT DOWN TO THE NUB. DENZEL WARD, KNOCKS IT JORDAN HICKS A LATE RUSH THAT TIME PUT THE HEAT. RUSHED THREE INTENTIONALLY, HICKS NOW YOU'VE GOT PICKENS UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING. THEY PULL HIM AWAY. JAMEIS WINSTON, TENTH WHERE DID WINSTON GO? >> Kirk: HE WENT TO >> Al: AS THE BACKUP. HE WAS ACTUALLY NUMBER 3 QUARTERBACK AT ONE >> Kirk: THIS DEFENSE GOT THE PRESSURE MOST OF THE NIGHT, DID WHAT THEY HAD TO DO. THIS TIME THE MOON BALL, THE INFAMOUS MOON BALL UP IN THE AIR. >> Al: NOW YOU'VE GOT FOUR STEELERS DOWN >> Kirk: NONE OF THE RECEIVERS REALLY IN POSITION TO HAVE ANY CHANCE AT ALL. GOOD JOB BY THE BROWNS KNOCKING THAT STRAIGHT >> Al: FOUR RECEIVERS, SIX DEFENDERS, BUT A LOSS OF ONE. AND THERE WAS THAT LATE MOVE, LEGAL BY >> Kirk: JIM SCHWARTZ, MYLES GARRET, WHAT A NIGHT FOR BOTH OF THOSE TWO. >> Al: LIKE YOU SAY YOU HAVE A TEAM, 2-8. LINE ON THE GAME IS RELATIVELY CLOSE, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. AND THE BROWNS PUT ON A SHOW TONIGHT. >> Kirk: THE BROWNS HAVE NOW BEAT THE STEELERS 5 OF THE LAST 6 WHEN THEY'VE COME TO >> Al: TALK ABOUT DIVISION RIVALRIES AND ALL THAT GOES WITH IT. A LOT OF TIMES IT'S A BUNCH OF HOOEY, BUT NOT IN THIS ELPIANTTD,SBUR
