ONE OF THE TOP RUNNING BACKS IN THE LEAGUE, AGNEW, AND FOUR OUT OF FIVE KICKS HAVE RESULTED IN TOUCHBACKS, AND THIS ONE DOES TOO. OUT COME THE JAGUARS. LAWRENCE, NOT REALLY DOING ANY PRACTICING THIS WEEK, JUST REHABBING. SEVEN TOUCHDOWNS, FOUR IN THE TWO GAMES AGAINST INDIANAPOLIS. DO NOT EXPECT HIM TO RUN MUCH TONIGHT. FROM THE 25 YARD LINE. HE HAS THE BRACE ON THE LEFT KNEE. THE RUNNING BACK IN THE BACKFIELD, STARTING IN MOTION. GETS IT TO ETIENNE, HE IS STUFFED AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. DAVIS WAS A LITTLE SHAKY THIS WEEK, WONDERING IF HE WOULD PLAY TONIGHT BUT THERE HE IS MAKING THE FIRST TACKLE OF THE GAME. KIRK: ONE THING ABOUT TREVOR LAWRENCE AND THAT KNEE, THEY WILL FEEL THINGS OUT EARLY. EXPECT QUICK PASSES, NOT A LOT OF MOBILITY, EVEN THOUGH THAT IS A BIG PART OF HIS GAME. QUICK PASSES ARE CRITICAL AL: DO NOT SIT IN THE POCKET TOO MUCH. HE GETS RID OF IT IN A HURRY, AND IT IS CAUGHT, NICE LIVING GRABBED BY EVAN INGRAM FOR THE FIRST DOWN OF THE NIGHT. KIRK: HE IS THE SECOND FASTEST IN THE LEAGUE GETTING THE BALL OUT AT 2.39. HE RECOGNIZES A GOOD CUSHION WITH INGRAM, AND TAKES IT. HE IS ABLE TO GIVE INGRAM THAT CHANCE. STAY AWAY FROM THAT LEFT KNEE. BIG DEFENDER, GRANDERSON, GOES DOWN LOW. ALL FANS WOULD LOVE TO SEE TREVOR LAWRENCE HEALTHY TONIGHT. AL: JAGS HAVE THREE TIGHT ENDS IN THIS SET. PASS FAKE, ETIENNE INTO SAINTS TERRITORY TO THE 39 YARD LINE. HE DOES NOT GET A LOT OF PUBLICITY BUT HE IS ONE OF THE BEST BACKS IN THE LEAGUE RIGHT NOW. KIRK: HE REALLY IS, AND THEY ARE ONE OF THE BEST SCREEN TEAMS IN THE LEAGUE. HE TIMED THIS UP PERFECTLY. 68 RIGHT THERE, THEN YOU GET ETIENNE IN SPACE. HE IS AS GOOD AS ANYBODY WITH ROOM TO WORK WITH. HIS GREATEST ATTRIBUTE, THE BALANCE AND THE ACCELERATION UPFIELD. AL: HE HAS MORE CARRIES AND TOUCHES THAN ANYBODY IN THE LEAGUE RIGHT NOW. MALCOLM ROACH MAKING THE TACKLE. SECOND DOWN AND 6. KIRK: WHEN THESE GUYS WERE TEAMMATES IN COLLEGE, EVERYBODY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT TREVOR LAWRENCE, BUT IF YOU WATCH CLEMSON, ETIENNE HAD MUCH TO DO WITH THAT SUCCESS. AL: BIGSBY IS THE RUNNING BACK BUT THEY SEND HIM WIDE. LAWRENCE WILL TAKE OFF AND SLIDES AT THE 25 YARD LINE. THE BENCH IS HOLDING THEIR BREATH. KIRK: THE OTHER NIGHT HE SAID, I WILL NOT SCRAMBLE OR RUN. I SAID, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR INSTINCTS TAKE OVER, HE SMILED AND SAID I WILL TRY NOT TO. THAT OPENED UP, HE SAW THE NUMBERS AND COULD NOT HELP HIMSELF. AL: MEANWHILE, THE INJURED SAINT IS TAYLOR. TIMEOUT HERE. PLAYS IN THE SLOT. HIS NUMBERS ARE GREAT DEFENDING OUT OF THE SLOT, BUT HAVING TO COME OUT OF THE GAME. KIRK: HE WAS THERE TO MAKE THE TACKLE ON TREVOR LAWRENCE, AND DOVE AND ENDED UP GOING DOWN. AL: #0 COMES IN FOR #1. KIRK: HE COMES OFF THE RIGHT SIDE DIVING, AND LANDS AWKWARDLY. I DO NOT THINK THE SAINTS THOUGHT TREVOR LAWRENCE WOULD BE MUCH OF A THREAT TONIGHT. THEY WERE SPREAD ALL OVER THE FIELD. NOBODY WAS AT LINEBACKER. AL: NOW THE ROOKIE, BIGSBY, COMES INTO THE BACK. PASS IS INCOMPLETE. INTENDED FOR ENGRAM. SECOND DOWN AND 10. LAWRENCE, THE NUMBER ONE OVERALL PICK, WHAT A DIFFERENCE THAT MADE. THE 2021 SEASON WAS ILL-FATED. LAWRENCE, THEY WERE SO BAD THAT YEAR, THEY HAD THE NUMBER ONE CHOICE THE NEXT YEAR, TOO. KIRK: LATE LAST YEAR HE WAS PLAYING AS WELL AS ANY QUARTERBACK IN THE LEAGUE. AL: SPINS OUT HERE, EXTRA EFFORT BY ENGRAM, TACKLED BY LATTIMORE. SETTING UP THIRD AND 7. KIRK: THEY PLAY A TON OF MAN DEMAND. HE WAS KEPT OUT OF MOST OF THE 2022 SEASON BUT SHOWS WHO HE CAN GET PHYSICAL. BIG EMPHASIS SETTING THE EDGE TO THIS DEFENSE. JACKSONVILLE DOES A GREAT JOB STRETCHING YOU HORIZONTALLY. AL: WOODS IS THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR BUT ALLEN' COORDINATOR BUT ALLEN'S PEDIGREE IS DEFENSE. THIRD DOWN AND 7. IN THE POCKET, FIRES, CAUGHT FOR ANOTHER FIRST DOWN. MOVING DOWN THE FIELD, CHRISTIAN KIRK, WHO CAME OVER LAST YEAR FROM THE ARIZONA CARDINALS. FOUR FIRST DOWNS ON THIS DRIVE, EIGHT PLAYS, 60 YARDS. KIRK: A GOOD JOB OF TREVOR LAWRENCE, THE IDEAS TO GET THE BALL OUT QUICKLY. THEY THINK CHRISTIAN KIRK COULD HAVE A HUGE NIGHT FROM THAT SLOT POSITION. GOOD AWARENESS OF WHERE HE NEEDED TO GO FOR THE FIRST DOWN. AL: OUT OF THE PISTOL THIS TIME. ETIENNE, D A LITTLE FLIP, AND INSIDE THE 5 GOES AGNEW. A RUNNING BACK SPECIALIST, HE TAKES IT DOWN TO A FIRST AND GOAL SITUATION FROM THE 2-YARD LINE. KIRK: THEY WILL TRY TO GET THE BALL IN HIS HANDS, AND IT IS A LOT OF TIMES A REVERSE LIKE THIS. JUST A STEP AHEAD OF THE SAINTS WITH A QUARTERBACK, WE WONDERED HOW HE WOULD HOLD UP. AL: SAINTS HAVE NOT ALLOWED AN OPENING DRIVE TD IN 18 GAMES, AND INTO THE END ZONE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A YEAR, TOUCHDOWN AGAINST THEM. TRAVIS ETIENNE TAKES IT INTO THE END ZONE. THAT TOOK ONLY 5:16. TEMPLATES, 75 YARDS. THEY PICKED UP SIX FIRST DOWNS. KIRK: HECK OF A DRIVE, GREAT WAY TO START THE GAME ON THE ROAD. THE OFFENSIVE LINE HAS HAD ISSUES WITH INJURIES. THEY ARE STARTING TO GEL. AND THIS IS A NIGHT FOR THEM, THEY HAVE BEEN MOVING PEOPLE IN AND OUT, BUT THAT WAS A GREAT DRIVE FOR THEM. AL: MCMANUS, THE LONGTIME BRONCO WITH THE EXTRA POINT. 9:44 LEFT IN THE QUARTER. GREAT DRIENED IN 1975. KICKOFF HERE GOES THROUGH THE END ZONE, AND DEREK CARR WILL TAKE HIS TEAM TO THE 25 YARD DEREK CARR, NINE YEARS WITH THE RAIDERS. THIS SEASON, FIVE TDS, TWO PICKS. HAD A LEAD AGAINST GREEN BAY AND LOSS. THEY HAVE LOST THREE OUT OF FOUR SELF-DESTRUCTED LAST WEEK IN HOUSTON. TRYING TO GET IT BACK TOGETHER HERE. KAMARA IS THE RUNNING BACK. CARR LOOKS ONE WAY, THE OTHER, THEN DROP BY KAMARA ON THE FIRST PLAY FROM SCRIMMAGE. IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND 10. KIRK: COMING OFF OF HOUSTON FOR DEREK CARR, AND WITNESSING BEFORE OUR EYES, THERE IS AN EXAMPLE, THE TIMING AND THE RHYTHM OF THIS OFFENSE. YOU HAVE GREAT INDIVIDUAL PLAYERS TRYING TO FIGURE THINGS OUT. WE WILL SEE HOW THEY DO TONIGHT. AL: IN THE MIDDLE. AN EXTRA MOVE AFTER KAMARA HAD THE INITIAL CONTACT, FOUR YARDS PAST THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND TURNS IT INTO A SIX YARD GAIN. THIRD AND 4. KIRK: EACH WEEK WE SEE THE SAME THEME, OFFENSIVE LINEMAN BANGED UP, AND A PATCHWORK GROUP ON A SHORT WEEK. I DO NOT KNOW IF THAT HAS BEEN MORE EVIDENT THAN NEW ORLEANS AL: ABSOLUTELY. STEPPING UP IN THE POCKET, CAUGHT, JUST ENOUGH FOR THE FIRST DOWN. CAUGHT BY ALVIN KAMARA. KIRK: FOR DEREK, YOU SAW A RARE MOMENT AT THE END OF THE GAME LAST WEEK WHERE HE WAS ANIMATED, FRUSTRATED. THERE WERE SOME BREAKDOWNS IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE RECEIVERS AND HIM NOT ON THE SAME PAGE. NOW HE IS STRETCHED OUT. AL: HILL. HE WILL KEEP IT, HE WILL RUN. HE PICKS UP ABOUT EIGHT YARDS. IF YOU WATCH THE SAINTS, YOU KNOW THAT HAPPENS WITH SOME FREQUENCY. KIRK: IT IS A GOOD CHANGEUP, YOU HAVE A GUY WHO CAN RUN THE ZONE READ. HE COLLAPSES, YOU PULL THE BALL OUT, JOSH ALLEN TAKES WILLIAMS, NOW YOU GET TO THE SECOND LEVEL WITH GOOD BLOCKS. TRY TO STAY AHEAD OF THE SIX. JACKSONVILLE DEFENSE PLAY A LOT OF ZONE. ESPECIALLY WITH THE OFFENSE STRUGGLING, TAKE THOSE POSITIVE YARDS. AL: SECOND DOWN AND 4. CARR STEPPING AWAY, FINDS TIME, FAKES, PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN. HE ROLLS OUT OF BOUNDS. ANGELO BLACKSON CHASING HIM. NOW THE SAINTS ON THE MOVE. KIRK: NICE TO SEE. YOU DO NOT ALWAYS ASSOCIATE SCRABBLING AND CREATING WITH DEREK CARR BUT HE REMINDS YOU HE IS ATHLETIC ENOUGH. HE IS IN HIS 10TH YEAR, 32 YEARS OLD. HERE MAKING A PLAY TO PICK UP THE YARDAGE HE NEEDED. AL: KAMARA SLIPS, FALLS, NO GAIN. IN THE HOUSE TONIGHT IS A MAN WHO OWNED THIS HOUSE FOR ABOUT 15 YEARS ALONG WITH SEAN PAYTON. THERE IS DREW BREES. SO MANY YEARS, SO MUCH CONSISTENCY, THEY WON A SUPER BOWL POST-KATRINA AND GOT THE CITY BACK TOGETHER. THEY HELPED GET THE CITY REVITALIZED. IT IS A DIFFERENT THING NOW. DEREK CARR COMES IN. SECOND AND 11. THE PASSES CAUGHT ON THE OUTSIDE. NICE MOVE BY CRYSTAL B -- CHRIS OLAVE. ANOTHER FIRST DOWN FOR NEW ORLEANS. KIRK: YOU ARE GOING AT THE CORNER, TYSON CAMPBELL DOES A NICE JOB GETTING IN FRONT. THEY WILL PLAY SOFT AND DO NOT WANT TO GIVE UP THE BIG PLAY. HECKUVA JOB BY OLAVE BEING ABLE TO SHAKE. HE EVEN THREW THE STIFF-ARM. AL: BACK TO THE GROUND. KAMARA FOR A SHORT GAME. NINTH PLAY UPCOMING. KIRK: BOTH OF THESE OFFENSES COMING OUT ON A SHORT WEEK WITH TEMPO WIND ENERGY AND SUCCESS MOVING THE STICKS. THAT HAD NOT BEEN AN ISSUE FOR P CARMICHAEL AND THIS OFFENSE. IT IS ABOUT GETTING INTO THE RED ZONE, CAN THEY COME AWAY WITH POINTS? THAT WAS A MAJOR CONCERN LAST WEEK. AL: MILLER IS THE BACK, A ROOKIE. HE WAS PICKED IN THE THIRD ROUND. SECOND AND 7. CARR. INCOMPLETE AT THE 20 YARD LINE. TIPPING IT AWAY FROM OLAVE. IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 7. KIRK: RIGHT AWAY, LIKE THAT TAMPA DEFENSE WERE YOU GET SOME DEPTH. READ GREAT JOB COMING OFF THE DEATH -- GREAT JOB COMING OFF THE DEPTH. HE SHOULD BE OUT IN FRONT. AL: PLAY CLOCK UNDER :05. THIRD AND 7. HE IS HIT AS HE THROWS, PASSING COMPLETE. PRESSURE COMING FROM THE BACKSIDE. THE DRIVE BOGS DOWN AFTER THREE FIRST DOWNS. IT IS FOURTH AND 7. KIRK: A LOT OF NEW PIECES UP FRONT, AND KAMARA IS LOOKING RIGHT. THE BLITZ COMES FROM THE NICKEL SPOT. NOBODY RECOGNIZES IT. HE GETS IN SNEAKING IN LATE. GREAT JOB DISGUISING TO THE LAST MOMENT ON THAT THIRD DOWN. AL: BLAKE GRUPE HAD TWO MRS. LAST WEEK. THIS IS -- HAD TWO MISSES LAST W EEK. GRUPE'S KICK IS NO GOOD. HE HAS MISSED THREE OUT OF HIS LAST FIVE. THEY could be... Kelce and Kel-see-how-much- you-can-save-by- bundling-home-and-auto. Yeah? If you make the letters smaller. Mahomes! MaAuto! Let's go! Put your jersey on! Bundling. Just another way to save with the Personal Price Plan. Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there. CAME IN, THEY WON A SUPER BOWL THREE YEARS LATER. CAUGHT AT THE 40 YARD LINE. THE BALL COMES OUT, STILL ALIVE. A SCRAMBLE FOR IT. KIRK: THE SAINTS THINK THEY HAVE IT. AL: THEY DO. GRANDERSON, #96, HAVING A REAL GOOD YEAR. KIRK MAKES THE GRAB. DID HE HAVE POSSESSION? KIRK: IT SURE LOOKS LIKE IT. THE OUTSIDE CORNER DOES A GOOD JOB KNOCKING THE BALL LOOSE WITH HIS LEFT ARM. >> FUMBLE RECOVERED BY THE DEFENSE. KIRK: KIRK HAD A CHANCE TO GET ON THAT. IT SLIPS THROUGH THEIR HANDS, THE SAINTS APPEAR TO BE ON TOP OF THE FOOTBALL. FIRST AND 10, PLAY-ACTION, TAKING A SHOT OVER DAVIS. AL: ON THE MOVE AGAIN, AND THAT ONE COMES TO A SCREECHING HALT AT THE 41-YARD LINE. KIRK SHAKING HIS HEAD AS HE LOOKS AT THE REPLAY. THE DRIVE STARTS FROM THE 41-YARD LINE. KAMARA RUNS INTO TRAFFIC. NO GAIN, STOPPED AT THE LINE OF SECOND AND 10. KIRK: THERE IS A BATTLE IN THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. THE SAINTS HAVE TO BE THANKFUL THE OFFENSE IS BACK ON THE THE WAY THEIR GAME ENDED LAST WEEK, A LOT OF CRITICISM LOCALLY. THEY ARE ANXIOUS TO GET BACK ON THE FIELD. THE JACKS GO RIGHT DOWN AND SCORE, THEN THEY MISS THE FIELD GOAL. FORTUNATE TO GET THIS TURNOVER, SEE IF THEY CAN DO ANYTHING WITH AL: PASS CAUGHT. OLAVE MAKES ANOTHER CATCH. IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 6, FROM NEAR MIDFIELD. THE JAGUAR DEFENSE, PETE CARMICHAEL, THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. HE WAS ON THE SEAN PAYTON STAFF, AND SO WAS ALLEN. WHEN THEY HAD TO FIND A NEW COACH, THEY STAYED IN-HOUSE. WILLIAMS IS NOW IN THE GAME, BACK AFTER MISSING THE LAST FEW GAMES WITH INJURY. OVER THE MIDDLE, THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE, INTENDED FOR SHAHEED. THEY GET THE TAKE AWAY BUT CANNOT DO ANYTHING WITH IT. KIRK: HECKUVA JOB ON THIRD DOWN. HE DOES A GOOD JOB PLAYING DEEP SAFETY, CISCO, READING THE EYES OF DEREK CARR, AND WAITING FOR ANYTHING ACROSS THE MIDDLE. SEE HOW QUICKLY HE WAS ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN ANTICIPATING THE CROSSING ROUTE. EVEN IF THE BALL IS ON THE MONEY, HE IS ABLE TO BE THERE. AL: HEDLEY, THE 30-YEAR-OLD ROOKIE HERE ALL KINDS OF ACTION. NEW ORLEANS COMES UP WITH THE BALL, BUT WHAT WILL BE THE CALL HERE? AGNEW WAS THERE. AGNEW IS HURT. HE APPARENTLY DID NOT CALL FOR THE FAIR CATCH. LOSS THE BALL. ANOTHER TURNOVER BY THE JAGUARS. KIRK: IT LOOKED AT HIS OWN GUY RAN INTO HIM. HE IS READY TO RECEIVE THIS. >> RECOVERED BY THE KICKING TEAM, FIRST DOWN. KIRK: ANOTHER BREAK FOR NEW ORLEANS, THIS TIME SPECIAL TEAMS JUMPING ON THIS. AL: CAMPBELL RUNS RIGHT INTO HIM. TWO TURNOVERS IN THE AL: GOOD TO SEE THAT AGNEW IS OK, TROTS OFF. IS THIS A FAIR CATCH SIGNAL OR NOT? >> IT IS, BORDERLINE INVALID BUT IT HAS NO EFFECT ON THE PLAY BECAUSE THE TEAMMATE OF THE RECEIVING TEAM LAYER -- PLAYER IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED. IT IS ALL ON HIM. AL: THAT WAS THE CASE CLEARLY ON THIS SHORT DRIVE FROM THE RED ZONE. THE CARRY HERE FOR WILLIAMS, WHO LAST YEAR WAS WITH DETROIT. WILLIAMS THIS YEAR GAINED OVER 1000 YARDS WITH DETROIT, BUT SUCH A PREMIUM, OR NOT A PREMIUM ON RUNNING BACKS. YOU ARE OUT, WE WILL BRING OTHER GUYS IN. HE COMES DOWN HERE TO BACK UP KAMARA. SECOND AND 6. KAMARA STAYS IN BOUNDS, NICE MOVE. FIRST AND GOAL, TAKES IT DOWN TO THE 6-YARD LINE. KIRK: KNOWN FOR THE SCREEN GAME, IT HAS NOT BEEN IRKING WELL. TO SEE IT CALLED AT THE RIGHT TIME. THE RED ZONE HAS BEEN A DISASTER IN THE LAST COUPLE OF LOSSES. THEY HAD POSSESSIONS THAT ENDED AT HOUSTON'S 27, 11, 15, AND 24. THAT IS THEIR LAST FOUR POSSESSIONS, AND ONLY CAME AWAY WITH THREE POINTS. AL: SELF IMMOLATION. SHORT GAIN ONE OR TWO YARDS KAMARA MISSED THE FIRST THREE GAMES, SUSPENDED DUE TO THE PERSONAL CONDUCT POLICY. HE GOT INTO A BAD BRAWL IN LAS VEGAS LAST YEAR AND HAD TO SIT OUT THE FIRST THREE GAMES. KIRK: THEY WILL GO JUMBO HERE TO GET MORE OFFENSIVE LINEMEN IN. AL: SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. GOOD PROTECTION. FINALLY HAS TO THROW, IT IS CAUGHT IN THE BACK OF THE END ZONE -- NO. SHAHEED WAS ABLE TO GET THERE, BUT COULD NOT STAY IN BOUNDS. IT LOOKED LIKE CARR WOULD THROW IT AWAY BUT THERE IS SHAHEED. KIRK: WHAT AN EFFORT, HE CLIMBED THE LADDER. THEY GO JUMBO MAKING THE JAGUARS DEFENSE INC. THEY WILL GO POWER AND RUN, AND INSTEAD THEY TRY TO GET OLAVE ISOLATED TO THE LEFT. HE ACTUALLY WENT DOWN, COVERED WELL. GOOD JOB BY SHAHEED TRYING TO KEEP THE PLAY ALIVE. AL: THIRD AND GOAL. THE RUNNING IS WILLIAMS. THE PASS IS BATTED AWAY IN THE THE BOO BIRDS ARE OUT AGAIN. BROWN BATTED IT AWAY, INTENDED FOR THOMAS. THEY CANNOT GET IN DOWN DEEP. KIRK: THIS IS WHO YOU WANT TO GO TO, MICHAEL THOMAS, 6' TO, MICHAEL THOMAS, 6'3". YOU KNOW WHAT HE DOES A GOOD JOB OF? HE HAS BEEN GETTING A LOT OF PRACTICE REPS. ANTICIPATING THE FADE. THE BALL NEEDED TO BE THROWN HIGHER TO GET IT TO THE TALLER RECEIVER. AL: BLAKE GRUPE, BANGS IT THROUGH. 1:26 REMAINING IN THE FIRST HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA. MEANWHILE, GOOD TO SEE AGNEW BACK AFTER TAKING THAT WHACK ON THE LAST ATTEMPTED PUNT RETURN. BLAKE GRUPE TO PUT IT IN THE AIR, THE FREE AGENT FROM NOTRE DAME. AGNEW WILL LET IT BOUNCE INTO THE END ZONE. KIRK: YOU GO BACK TO THE JAGS' KIRK: YOU GO BACK TO THE JAGS' FIRST POSSESSION, EVERYTHING YOU WOULD WANT TO SEE. THE QUESTION WAS HOW WOULD TREVOR LAWRENCE AND HIS KNEE HOLD UP. THE FIRST DRIVE LOOKED GREAT. DELIVERING THE FOOTBALL TO SIX DIFFERENT JAGS ON THAT DRIVE. IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY BETTER. THEY CAME BACK ONLY TO HAVE A FUMBLE. AL: UP TO THE 30 YARD LINE. ETIENNE, LIKE LAWRENCE, WENT IN THE FIRST ROUND. THEY WERE CELEBRATING, AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE YOUR COLLEGE TEAMMATE COMING WITH. HE WAS EXCITED. KIRK: ALL THE HOOPLA AND CRAZINESS AND AFTER THE DRAFT YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT YOUR TEAMMATES, CRAZY. THEN HE FINDS OUT ETIENNE IS COMING WITH HIM. AL: HE HURT HIS FOOT IN HIS ROOKIE YEAR, DID NOT PLAY AT ALL. HAD A GOOD YEAR LAST YEAR. THE ROOKIE WILL TAKE THE BALL TO THE 32. THEY PICKED HIM IN THE THIRD ROUND OUT OF AUBURN. FINAL MINUTE OF THE FIRST QUARTER. IT IS THIRD DOWN AND 2. KIRK: BEING A ROOKIE, THEY HAVE EASED HIM MEN, ETIENNE HAS CARRIED THE LOAD. THE MORE AND MORE THE JACK CN TRUST BIGSBY, -- THE MORE A MORE THE JAGS SEE AND TRUST BIGSBY, HE CAN BE THE GO TO GUY. AL: ALREADY TWO TURNOVERS THAT RESULTED IN ONE FIELD GOAL AND ONE MISSED FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT. THIRD AND 3. LAWRENCE BOUNCING AROUND. HE IS PLAYING REALLY WELL. KAYLEE: HOW DO YOU SETTLE DOWN YOUR TEAM AFTER THE EARLY TURNOVERS? >> WE WILL BE FINE. MISS COMMUNICATION ON THE PUNT RETURN, IT GOT A LITTLE LOUD. THEN CHRISTIAN HAS TO BE SMART IN THAT SITUATION. AL: WE ARE BACK WITH A LITTLE TRICKERY HERE AS AGNEW MAKES THE CATCH. AGNEW COMING TO THE NEAR SIDE, A LITTLE RAZZLE-DAZZLE. EIGHT YARD GAIN AFTER ALL OF THAT. KIRK: I'M SO IMPRESSED WITH DOUG PEDERSON AND WHAT HE HAS BROUGHT TO THIS FRANCHISE. THERE WAS A LITTLE TURMOIL WHEN HE CAME IN. NOT JUST SUCCESS ON THE FIELD AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING BUT THE CULTURE AND THE WAY THE PLAYERS LEAD THE TEAM. HE IS DOING A HECKUVA JOB. AL: TREMENDOUS, GOT THEM TO THE PLAYOFFS LAST YEAR. WENT TO KANSAS CITY AND TOOK THEM TO THE WIRE. THEY PICK UP A FIRST DOWN HERE WITH ETIENNE. COACHING THE EAGLES TO THE ONLY SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP. KIRK: WHEN YOU WON THAT SUPER BOWL IN RECENT YEARS, YOU CATCH THEIR. THEY WANT TO FOLLOW YOU AND TRUST WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY, AND IT HAS WORKED OUT FOR THEM. AL: AT THE 48 YARD LINE. THAT DOES THE JOB, AND THERE GOES LAWRENCE AGAIN DOWN THE SIDELINE AND OUT OF BOUNDS. ONCE AGAIN, INSTINCTIVE, AS DOUG PEDERSON WAS TELLING KAYLEE. MEANWHILE, HE HAS CARRIED THE BALL TWICE FOR 34 YARDS. KIRK: THE INSTINCTS TO TAKE OVER, AND HE DID TELL US AS HE IS TESTING IT OUT -- >> HOLDING, DEFENSE, #4. FIVE YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN. KIRK: AS HE WAS TESTING IT, HE SAID RUNNING STRAIGHT DOES NOT BOTHER HIM. IN THE SCRAMBLES WE HAVE SEEN, IT IS NOT THE LATERAL MOVEMENT. THEY BLITZ, HE SEES THE HOLE AND TAKES OFF. HE DOES THE SMART THING AND GETS OUT OF THE BOUNDS. AT HIS SIZE, 6'5", HE COVERS A LOT OF GROUND. AL: SECOND-LONGEST RUN OF HIS CAREER, 26 YARDS. THE PENALTY WAS ON TAYLOR, IT WAS DECLINED. FIRST DOWN FROM THE 17 YARD A LITTLE FLIP. ETIENNE TAKES IT TO THE END TOUCHDOWN. MAN, OH MAN, HOW QUICKLY DO THEY GET IN? OF COURSE, THE CROWD ARE LETTING THE SAINTS KNOW IT. 17 YARDS. ETIENNE HAS FIVE TOUCHDOWNS IN HIS LAST THREE APPEARANCES. KIRK: YOU GET MOTION FROM CHRISTIAN KIRK. HE WILL SET UP TO THE LEFT, BUT WATCH THE DEFENSIVE RESPONSE. THE LITTLE FAKE HERE TO GO AROUND, AND THEY FLIP IT TO ETIENNE TO GET IN THE CORNER. AL: ETIENNE MAKE IT SIX CAMPERS TO THE END ZONE, TWO TONIGHT, TWO BACKS YOU WILL SEE, AND THIS JETS SWEEP OCCUPIES THE THEY START TO MOVE AND THEN YOU GET HIM TO THE CORNER. OVER 20 MILES AN HOUR, THE ACCELERATION, AND ONCE YOU TAKE ONE STEP AS AN AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AND NUMBER WHAT IS GOING THE OTHER WAY, IT IS TOUGH TO CATCH UP. AL: TWO OR MORE TDS IN THREE STRAIGHT GAMES, FIRST IN FRANCHISE HISTORY. KAYLEE: CHRISTIAN KIRK TOLD ME ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IMPRESSES HIM ABOUT TRAVIS ETIENNE'S CONTACT BALANCE. YOU HAVE TO WRAP HIM UP, WHICH KIRK SAID WAS CRAZY BECAUSE THAT 5'10", 215, HE IS NOT THE BIGGEST BUT JUST A NATURAL. HE SAID IT SURPRISES PEOPLE HOW DURABLE HE IS AS HE BOUNCES OFF DEFENDERS AND GOES FROM ZERO TO 100 AND A SECOND. THAT IS WHAT MAKES THEM FUN TO WATCH. AL: WE MENTIONED BEFORE, HE MISSED HIS ENTIRE ROOKIE SEASON WITH A FOOT INJURY. AND HAS HAD A TERRIFIC START IN 2023. THAT THROW WAS CAUGHT AT THE 30-YARD LINE TO START ON THE FIVE YARD LINE. SHE HE' SHE HE'D MAKING THE CATCH. HE IS AS FAST AS ANYBODY IN THE LEAGUE. KIRK: THE SAINTS HAVE HAD A TOUGH WEEK AFTER THAT LOSS IN THE WAY THEY LOST TO HOUSTON, AND THEY GET THE GAME STARTED BACK AT HOME, ONE TEAM TO KEEP THE CROWD ENGAGED AND THEY GET TWO TURNOVERS RIGHT AWAY. ABLE TO TURN THEM INTO THREE POINTS NOW THEY ARE DOWN 14-3. SECOND AND 5. CON AT THE 42ND YARD LINE. GETS IT TO MOREAU. JOHNSON IS THEIR NUMBER ONE TIGHT END, INACTIVE TONIGHT, SO MOREAU IS THE MAN. KIRK: YOU SEE 12 THERE,, TAKES THE CORNER WITH HIM. THE BALL HAD TO GET OUT EARLY, AND HE DOES A GOOD JOB OF ANTICIPATING FOR ANDRE CISCO AND JENKINS COME OVER TO MAKE A PLAY. AL: JAMAAL WILLIAMS TILDE 48 YARD LINE. HE HAD A THREE-GAME SUSPENSION, AND ALSO, HE TOOK A LITTLE OF THE WORKLOAD AWAY FROM HIM BUT THEN HE GOT HURT, WILLIAMS DID, BUT AFTER MISSING THREE THROUGH FIVE. KIRK: ALL THESE YEARS, THEY HAVE ALWAYS HAD THAT THUNDER AND LIGHTNING TYPE OF BACK YIELDS, SO IT IS GOOD TO SEE WILLIAMS. BACK AND HEALTHY AL: SECOND AND 6. RIGHT SIDE HERE. WILLIAMS AGAIN. LLOYD STOPS HIM AT THE 45 YARD THIRD DOWN AND 3 FOR THE SAINTS. KIRK: THE LINE SHIFT, THEY BROUGHT IN FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT PLAYERS FOR THIS THIRD DOWN PLAY. AL:, SLIDE, HE IS IN THE -- THOMAS IS IN THE SLOT. HILL IS IN THERE. AT 3. FIRES. BATTED AWAY AT THE LAST MOMENT. TRYING AGAIN TO THOMAS. IT IS DARIOUS WILLIAMS WHO WON A SUPER BOWL WITH THE RAMS TWO YEARS AGO. COMES OVER HERE, BATS IT AWAY, FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: THIRD DOWN AND 3, HE THOUGHT YOU WOULD SEE A CROSSER, BUT AFTER A LOT OF COMMUNICATION , A VERY LOW PERCENTAGE ROUTE DOWN THE FIELD TO THOMAS. GREAT TECHNIQUE BY WILLIAMS. AL: THEY LINE UP TO GO FOR THE FOURTH DOWN, AND THEY ARE GOING FOR IT. CARR THROWS. INCOMPLETE, GUIDED AWAY. DEVIN LLOYD GOT HIS HAND ON IT. INDICATION IS THE PENALTY IS AGAINST OLUOKUN. REFEREE: OFFENSE, NUMBER 13, A PENALTY. AL: THOMAS MISSED HIM, GOT THE BALL IN THE AIR MIDFIELD. 10:43 TO THE HALF. IT IS0-2 IN THE DOME, BUT, SO FA GOOD TONIGHT. RIGHT NOW, HE HAS A FIRST AND 10 GETTING THIS DRIVE AFTER A TURNOVER. HE IS NOT VERY GOOD BELOW SEA LEVEL. KIRK: YEAH, UNFORTUNATELY. I CALLED BOTH THOSE LOSSES WHEN HE WAS IN COLLEGE, AND HE WAS ALWAYS IN COMMAND AND IN CONTROL, KIND OF LIKE WHAT WE ARE SEEING TONIGHT, EVEN WITH THAT KNEE HURTING. THEY PUT TOGETHER A HECK OF A PLAN, PETERSON IMPRESSED TAYLOR. AL: THE BALL IS OUT QUICK. CANNOT HELP HIMSELF. WE HAVE SEEN A COUPLE OF THOSE SCRAMBLES. IT HAS BEEN OBVIOUS. DRIFTING AROUND ON DEFENSE. FOUR MEN RUSH. RIGHT INTO THE AIR, INCOMPLETE. THAT IS ON CAM JORDAN, WHO IS IN HIS 13TH SEASON WITH A BAD THIRD DOWN, SO CAM AND HIS FATHER, OF THE GREAT TIGHT END FOR MINNESOTA, HE PLAYED 13 YEARS. CAM SAYS ONE MORE? TWO MORE. KIRK: HE SAID, I HAVE AT LEAST TWO. AL: IN GREAT SHAPE. KIRK: GREAT AGAINST A RUN AND STILL AN EXPLOSIVE PLAYER. AL: THIRD AND 10. SENDING IN AN EXTRA MAN. PASSES INCOMPLETE. THAT PUSHES THE PRESSURE ON LAWRENCE. HE COULD NOT RECONNECT. PUTTING THE HEAT ON IN HIS KIRK: THEY BROUGHT PRESSURE AND PLAYED ZONE BEHIND, CONFUSING THE OFFENSIVE LINE UP FRONT. AND THESE DEFENSIVE ENDS, IF THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO AFFECT THE GAME, IT IS ON THIRD DOWN SITUATIONS. WINS ON THE LEFT SIDE AGAINST ROBBERSON ENFORCED THE BALL OUT EARLY. AL: LOGAN COOKE, HIS FIRST PUNT OF THE NIGHT. SHAHEED IS BACK TO RECEIVE IT. HE CAN FLY IF HE GETS ROOM, BUT HE HAS TO PULL UP WITH A FAIR LET'S SEE IF THE SAINTS CAN MUSTER SOMETHING OFFENSIVELY. THEY RUN 24 PLAYS FROM 90 YARDS. LESS THAN 40 YARDS PER PLAY. KIRK: THE ONE FIELD GOAL THEY HAD, THEY STARTED AT THE 13 YARD AL: WOULD LOVE TO GET IT BACK AFTER JACKSONVILLE. GOES OVER THE MIDDLE. A LOT OF ROOM TO RUN. FIRST DOWN IS PICKED UP, SO 22 AFTER THE 35. KIRK: ANYTIME YOU SEE A QUARTERBACK IN THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE EXECUTING WELL AND PLAYING WITH CONFIDENCE IT IS BECAUSE HE HAS ANSWERS. RIGHT NOW WHEN YOU WATCH DEREK CARR, HE IS LEARNING A NEW OFFENSE, LEARNING WITH ME RECEIVERS, OFTEN TIMES, IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS UNSURE. AND THAT HAS BEEN PRETTY EVIDENT OF ANY THROWS HE HAS MADE. AL: STUCK IN THE BACKFIELD RIGHT THERE. AND THEN YOU HAVE GOT A FLAG DOWN THERE. IT IS ONE THING TO STOP WHEN THE WHISTLE BLOWS, AND IT IS ANOTHER TO THROW A WRESTLING MOVE I GET THE PENALTY HERE -- AND GET THE PENALTY HERE. REFEREE: AFTER THE PLAY, PERSONAL FOUL, UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS, DEFENSE, NUMBER 90, 15-YARD PENALTY. KIRK: HE COULD NOT HAVE PLAYED IT BETTER WITH A SWIM TECHNIQUE OFF THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. PETERSON SAYS, USE OUR HEAD. HE GETS INTO THE BACKFIELD ON THE WHISTLE IS ALREADY BLOWN AND BODY SLAMS KAMARA INTO THE GROUND. AL: I EVEN KNOW HOW HE CAN -- I DO NOT EVEN KNOW HOW HE CAN STATE HIS CASE THERE. JUST A LITTLE GAME, FIRST DOWN. UP AT THE 47 YARD LINE. THIS IS SHAHEED ON THE SLOT BACK AROUND, CHECKING IN WITH KAYLEE. KAYLEE: DENNIS ALLEN SAID THIS WEEK THAT COMMUNICATION HAS TO BE BETTER ON THE SAINTS OFFENSE BUT WHEN I TALKED TO MICHAEL THOMAS, HE WANTED TO CLARIFY AND SAID I DO NOT WANT TO POINT FINGERS -- NUMBER 70 IS ELIGIBLE. KAYLEE: AVIATORS COMMUNICATION ON ONE OR TWO PLAYS BUT NOT COMMUNICATION -- HE SAID MAYBE IT IS COMMUNICATION ONE ARE TWO PLAYS BUT NOT COMMUNICATION. HE SAID THEY HAVE TO FOCUS ON MAKING PLAYS. AL: THEY HAVE TO FOCUS ON GETTING SOMETHING STARTED, PLAY ACTION PAST AND KAMARA WITH A NICE TACKLE, DARIOUS WILLIAMS, PLAYED WITH THE RAMS, CAME OVER HERE AND HAS THAT SUPER BOWL RING AND THEIR VICTORY OVER CINCINNATI AFTER THE 2021 SEASON. KIRK: WHAT IS AMAZING ABOUT WILLIAMS, KAMARA AFTER THAT HIT, OFF THE SIDELINE -- WHAT IS AMAZING ABOUT WILLIAMS, HE IS A GUY WHO REALLY HAS BEEN MORE OF A SPOT CORNER. HE HAS FOUND A HOME AND PLAYS WITH GOOD VISION ON THE PERIMETER OF THE DEFENSE. AL: KAMARA ON THE SIDELINE. WILLIAMS IS BACK IN, THIRD DOWN AND 3. BATTED AWAY AGAIN. LOOKING FOR A FLAG BUT THERE IS NONE. HE IS THERE ON HIS FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: ON THIRD DOWN, THEY ARE NOT FEELING THREATENED DOWNFIELD, SO HE SETTLES AT THE TOP OF THE ROUTE AND EXPECTS THIS BALL TO BE COMING OUT. HE HAS THE ABILITY TO GO BY BUT THERE IS A FIRST DOWN MARKER. REALLY GOOD JOB OF JUST THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS BUYER SLOT CORNER. JUST BEING SMART, DOES NOT INTERFERE AND KNOCKS THE BALL AWAY. AL: ON THE MOVE. AT THE 18 YARD LINE, HOLDING BY AGNEW. 7:17 REMAINING IN THE FIRST HALF. 14-3, JAGUARS. MAYFIELD GAVE US THAT PERFORMANCE ON THURSDAY NIGHT IN L.A. LAST YEAR WHEN HE LED THE TEAM TO A FANTASTIC DRAMATIC DRIVE AT THE END OF THE GAME TO BE THE RAIDERS. KIRK: READING THE OFFENSE, TRYING TO LEARN THE SYSTEM AS BEST HE COULD. HE SHOWED UP WITH A WRISTBAND AND ENDED UP FINDING A WAY TO WIN. AL: WHAT A NIGHT, AND NOW HE IS THE MAN IN TAMPA. THEY ARE OFF TO A DECENT START. WE SEE THEM NEXT WEEK IN BUFFALO ON THURSDAY. SWEET PASS HERE, MOVING TO THE INSIDE. ETIENNE PICKS UP ABOUT EIGHT. THE JAGUARS ARE ON THEIR WAY. THEY HOPE -- YOU KNOW, WE MENTIONED AT THE START, THE SAINTS ARE SEEN SOME GOOD AND SOME BAD, EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. SO FAR, THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET TOGETHER OFFENSIVELY. KIRK: I THINK THEY'RE HOPING THE REASON THEY PUNT HERE, THEY TRY TO RELY ON THEIR DEFENSE BEFORE THE HALF TO GET THE BALL BACK. THERE OFFENSE, -- IT IS LIKE WE ARE STUCK. THEY ARE NOT QUITE ABLE TO GET THIS GOING. A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL ABILITY, JUST NOT QUITE CLICKING YET. AL: THE CROWD GETS IMPATIENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DECADE AND A HALF OF SEAN PAYTON AND DREW BREES. THEY ARE NOT USED TO SEEING KIRK: NO. AND MANY YEARS OF THIS OFFENSE BEING LOOKED AT AS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE NFL. DREW BREES REALLY SPOILED THEM. THEY HAD A LOT OF TALENT AROUND WITHDREW. GREAT TO SEE HIM HERE TONIGHT. BUT, YEAH, IT IS A TALENT THAT IS USED TO OFFENSIVE PRODUCTION AND PUT BIG POINTS ON THE BOARD. AL: THIRD AND 3. RECEIVER TO THE LEFT. GO THAT WAY. WE MAKE THE GRAB ALONG THE SIDELINE. -- AGNEW MAKES THE GRAB ALONG THE SIDELINE AND OUT OF BOUNDS. KIRK: HE WAS ABLE TO, YOU KNOW, WITH SOFTER COVERAGE FROM LATTIMORE ON THIRD DOWN, HE TRUSTS HIS INSTINCTS SO MUCH THAT HE THINKS HE CAN DRIVE ON THE BALL. THE BALL IS JUST THROWN WHERE AGNEW CANNOT MAKE A PLAY ON IT. AL: INCOMPLETE, FOURTH DOWN. PUNT. LOGAN COOKE. ANOTHER FAIR CATCH. PLAYING HIS THROW, SO YOU HAVE SHAHEED CALLING FOR THE CATCH. YOU HAVE ON TONIO JOHNSON RUNNING INTO HIM -- ANTONIO JOHNSON RUNNING INTO HIM, SO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT PENALTY IS GOING TO BE. AND WE WILL HEAR FROM LANDON CLARK IN A MOMENT. ALL KINDS OF STUFF GOING ON IN THESE HERE CATCHES TONIGHT. -- FAIR CATCHES TONIGHT. KIRK: THE LATE FAIR CATCH NOT IMPACT THIS AT ALL. JOHNSON RUNS RIGHT INTO HIM. IT IS A FOUL. REFEREE: INTERFERENCE WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO CATCH A KICK. NUMBER 26, KICKING TEAM. 15 YARD PENALTY. KIRK: THE IDEA TO PUNT THAT BALL AWAY ON FOURTH AND 3 WORKS OUT. THE DEFENSE IS THEIR JOB. NOW AFTER THAT PENALTY, THEY ARE GOING TO BE STARTING THIS NEXT POSSESSION IN PLUS TERRITORY. AL: 35 YARD PUNT, 20 NETTED AT THE END OF THE DAY AFTER THE IN THE BALL OF THE JAGUARS, 36 YARD LINE, 5:41 UNTIL THE HALF. KAMARA BACK IN. GETS IT TO KAMARA. BUNCH OF WHITE SHIRTS SURROUND HIM, TAKES IT TO THE 43 YARD KIRK: THEY ARE PLAYING A DEEP TWO DEEP SAFETIES, IT'LL BACK FIELD GETTING DOWNFIELD -- MIDDLE BACK FIELD GETTING DOWNFIELD. THE OPTION MANY TIMES IS GETTING DOWN TO KAMARA. ONLY TWO PERCEPTIONS ON THE NIGHT, 17 YARDS. THOMAS DOES NOT HAVE A RECEPTION. JAGS HAVE TAKEN MOST LOOKS DOWNFIELD AWAY. AL: NINE AND 18, 80 YARDS TOTAL. KAMARA AGAIN. HE GETS STUCK AT THE 42 YARD KAMARA RIGHT NOW HAS CARRIED THE BALL. SEVEN CARRIES, EIGHT YARDS. KIRK: THE BOOK WOULD TELL YOU AGAINST A TEAM PLAYING A LOT OF ZONE, YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL WITH TWO SAFETIES THAT ARE BACK BUT WITH THIS MAKESHIFT OFFENSE OF LINE, IT PUTS THEM IN A TOUGH SPOT. THAT IS WHY THEY CANNOT GET TO DEVIN LLOYD, THE BACKER. AL: CARR UNDER PRESSURE, GETS IT CARR FRUSTRATED, LAST WEEK, HE SAID HE WAS LIVID. FOURTH DOWN AND 3. LAST TIME THEY WERE IN THIS AREA, THEY WENT FOR IT TAN THEY LEAVE THE OFFENSE OUT THERE AGAIN. KIRK: AND, SPATIAL PRESSURE, JUST BRINGING IT FORWARD, YOU EXPECT 41, JOSH ALLEN TO BE A FACTOR ON THESE PASSING DOWN'S. HE IS LIGHT UP TO THE OFFENSE' HE IS LIGHT UP TO THE OFFENSE' LEFT. THEY HAVE A GOOD PUSH IN THE MIDDLE THAT TIME, TOO. AL: FOURTH AND 3. GETS IT AWAY. JUST BEFORE HE GETS HIT, KAMARA MAKES THE CATCH AND PICKS UP THE GIVES THE CROWD SOMETHING TO GET EXCITED ABOUT. KIRK: HE GOT THAT OUT JUST IN TIME BECAUSE PETE TO, THE LEFT TACKLE, GOING UP AGAINST JOSH ALLEN WITH SEVEN SACKS ON THE YEAR, JUST IN TIME BEFORE HE GETS BLOWN UP ON THAT FOURTH DOWN. WE HAVE SEEN KAMARA WORK, SHAKE IT UP TO THE MIDDLE, AND THAT TIME HE WORKS TO THE OUTSIDE. CARR WAS LUMPED IN AND WE SAW THAT MATCHUP AGAINST THE LINEBACKER. AL: WILLIAMS TAKES INTO THE 20 . BRICKS AND THE TACKLE UNDER THREE MINUTES TO PLAY IN THE FIRST HALF. KIRK: IT IS REALLY AN EXTENSION OF MIKE CALDWELL, LIKE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR OUT ON THE FIELD. HE AND DEVIN LLOYD ARE HAVING GREAT GAMES, IF THEY ARE GETTING DOWNHILL IN A HURRY, AND THEN BEING INVOLVED IN THE PAST GAME, WHERE THEY ARE DROPPING THE ZONE AND THEN RALLYING TO THE THROWS UNDERNEATH THEM. AL: SECOND AND 8. EXTRA PRESSURE. FIRED. INCOMPLETE. CUTTING ACROSS OVER THE MIDDLE. MAKING IT THIRD DOWN AND 8. KIRK: HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE YOU ARE STILL SEEING CARR AND HIS RECEIVERS, WHO ARE GIFTED, STILL WORKING IT OUT AS FAR AS THE TIMING. CARRCARR FEELS TO ME THAT IS EXPECTING -- FEELS TO ME THAT CARR IS EXPECTING HIM TO WORK MORE HERE THAN DOWN. IT WAS THROWN A LITTLE BIT MORE TO THE OUTSIDE, AND SLIGHTLY OFF ON THE TIMING. AL: GOOD POINT. THIRD DOWN AND 8. EXTRA MAN COMES. ? CANDY GET TO THE FIRST DOWN CANNOT -- CAN HE GET TO THE FIRST DOWN? CANNOT. CARR DOES NOT WANT TO SEE THE FIELD GOAL UNIT COME IN. HE WANTS TO GO FOR IT, BUT ALAN HAS OTHER IDEAS. SO DOES THE CROWD. WE HAVE REACHED THE 20-MINUTE WARNING IN NEW ORLEANS ON THIS THURSDAY NIGHT. JAGUARS UP TO 11. MOST ALL JACKSONVILLE, TRYING TO MAKE IT. FIVE FIELD YARD ATTEMPT. MADE ONE, MISSED ONE. GETS THAT WHEN DOWN THE MIDDLE. 14 TO SIX, 1:57. NO TEAM HAS STARTED 6-0 FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 2017, WITH THE EAGLES AND NINERS LOSING SUNDAY. THE LIONS, FIRST TIME SINCE 1993, BEST RECORD IN THE NFL, LATE INTO THE SEASON, EVERYTHING GOING SWIMMINGLY IN THE MOTOR CITY, AND 15 RUSHING TDS, 15 RUSHING TDS -- PASSING TDS. 1958 BALTIMORE COLTS, WHO BEAT THE GIANTS, IN MAYBE ONE OF THE GREAT GAMES EVER PLAYED, AND ONE OF THE FIRST EVER OVERTIME GAME, BEAT THE GIANTS IN KIRK: KIRK: THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. WHAT A GAME WITH MIAMI AND PHILLY THIS WEEK. IT WILL BE A LOT OF FUN TO SEE HOW THOSE TWO TEAMS COLLIDE. AL: 14-6, THE JAGUARS ON TOP. AND STARTING FROM THE 25. NOW WEFROM THE 25 YARD LINE, JAG BEGIN THIS RIDE WITH A PASS TO THE OUTSIDE. PRETTY CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN. KIRK MAKING THE CATCH HERE, TAYLOR NOXON OUT OF BOUNDS. -- KNOCKS HIM OUT OF BOUNDS. KIRK: WITH THE ABILITY OF TREVOR LAWRENCE AND THE WEAPONS HE HAS ON THE FACTS THAT THE SAINTS GET THE BALL TO START THE SECOND HALF, THEY'RE GOING TO TURN IT UP AND TRY TO PUT POINTS ON THE BOARD. AL: ON THE OUTSIDE. FIRST DOWN, TWO PASSES, TWO FIRST DOWNS, INGRAM HAS MADE THREE TONIGHT. KIRK: YOU LOOK AT HIM AS A TIGHT END, BUT TECHNICALLY, WHAT A VALUABLE COMMODITY HE IS, WERE YOU CAN FLEX HIM OUT WITH REALLY A BIGGER WIDE RECEIVER WHEN YOU WATCH HIM RUN HIS ROUNDS, 6'3", 240 POUNDS, AND JONES GETS BACK AND HE IS PLAYING AS MUCH RECEIVER AS HE CAN AT TIGHT END. AL: FLAG HERE. REFEREE: FALSE START. OFFENSE, NUMBER 17. FIVE YARD PENALTY. AL: IT IS ON INGRAM -- ENGRAM. KIRK: PETERSON HAS TO BE PRETTY EXCITED WITH WHAT HE HAS SEEN HIS OFFENSE THE FIRST HALF. SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT TREVOR LAWRENCE, HIS KNEE, WOULD HE PLAY? WENT OUT TO THE PREGAME WARM-UP TO SEE HOW HE WOULD FEEL AND WORE A BRACE HIS FIRST TIME IN HIS CAREER AT COLLEGE OR THE PROS AND EXECUTED PRETTY WELL. AL: HE IS A LEADING RUSHER IN THE GAME, 35 YARDS. YOU KNOW WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT THIS TEAM IS ONLY GOING TO PLAY ONE GAME IN THE NEXT 23 DAYS. THEY HAVE TO MANY BYE COMING UP AND THEN THEY HAVE THE REAL ONE. AND HE LOOKED AT THIS AND SAID, YOU KNOW, LET'S LET HIM REST. KIRK: IF YOU WOULD HAVE HAD ANY KIND OF FEELING IN THE PREGAME WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK, LET'S LET HIM REST, I THINK ALL INDICATIONS WERE HE FEELS GOOD, LET'S TURN HIM LOOSE. AL: SECOND AND 4. ETIENNE THE INTENDED RECEIVER, CHASED BY ANOTHER CLEMSON ITE. KIRK: HE JUST HEARD THE STORY ABOUT BRIAN. YOU SEE HE TURNED HIS HEAD REAL QUICK TO LOOK AT TREVOR LAWRENCE, LIKE, I GOT YOU ON THAT ONE. AL: INDEED. CAUGHT LEAPING FOR IT SHORT OF THE FIRST. AGNEW, FOURTH DOWN AND A COUPLE. THEY MAKE THE TACKLEKIRK: WE HAV MAKE MANY PLAYS. HE WAS FRUSTRATED BY THIS HOLD BY THE ROOKIE. NO CALL. AL: FORFEND 2 -- FOURTH AND 2. A FAKE AND A FIRST DOWN. COOKE THROWS A TO TIM JONES! MAINLY A SPECIAL TEAMS GUY, BUT CAN PLAY RECEIVER. HE HAD THREE RECEPTIONS COMING INTO THE GAME. THERE IS 4, 13 YARDS ON THE WORTH AND2. KIRK: WATCH HIM OUT THERE AGAINST HIM. HE LOSES HIM, TURNS HIS HEAD. WHEN HE TURNS AROUND, HE IS CATCHING A FOOTBALL. CATCHES HIM OFF GUARD. HE GAVE THE LOOK LIKE I AM COMING TO YOU. AL: FROM THE 33 YARD LINE. LAWRENCE FIRES. FROM 26 GOES ENGRAM, SECOND DOWN AND A TIMEOUT TAKEN HERE. KIRK: DOUG PEDERSON OF JACKSONVILLE, THE TIMING OF THAT AND EVERYBODY IS THINKING, THEY ARE UP 14 AND 6. HE IS ALWAYS WILLING TO TAKE CALCULATED RISKS AND GO BACK TO THE SUPER BOWL. EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THE PHILLY SPECIAL HERE. IT IS AN AGGRESSIVE MINDSET, AND IT PAYS OFF AND GIVES TREVOR LAWRENCE A NEW SET OF DOWNS AND A COUPLE OF SHOTS IN THE END YOU NEVER KNOW. AL: LOGAN COOKE HAD KIRK: A NICE PASS. KIRK:SHIRTED -- SURE DID. AL: HE IS THE PUNTER, THE HOLDER, AND IN 10 DAYS IN ENGLAND, HE PLAYED FOUR ROUNDS OF GOLF. SECOND AND 3. THAT IS CAUGHT, AND LET'S SEE WHAT A SPOT IT. FIRST DOWN INITIALLY, AND THEN BACK. KIRK: FOR AN AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE, THEY HAVE BEEN FIXING IN A LITTLE BIT MORE ZONE ON THE SERIES RELYING ON THAT FRONT TO TRY TO GET HOME AND TRY TO KEEP THE BALL IN FRONT AND RALLY TO DEFENSIVE LINE, THEY GET INTO ROTATING DIFFERENT PLAYERS, JORDAN, BRESEE. ALL CAN WIN ONE-ON-ONE BATTLES UP FRONT. AL: THIRD DOWN, 2. THROWS. AND IT IS PICKED! LATTIMORE! TAKING THE BIG POSITION. THAT DRIVE ENDS THERE. 10 FOR AGNEW. IN A MOMENT OF TIME WHEN THEY REALLY NEEDED IT. KIRK: AGNEW IS KNOWN FOR SWEEPS, REVERSES AND SPEED, NOT NECESSARILY HIS ROUTE RUNNING. LATTIMORE, A CRAFTY VETERAN, HAS HIS EYES ON THE QUARTERBACK BUT HE DOES NOT GET FULL TO THE INSIDE AND IS ABLE TO REVERSE AND THEN CLOSE ON IT, ANTICIPATING THAT ALL IS GOING TO BE THROWN LOW AND THE WEIGHT AND IS ABLE TO LAY OUT AND MAKE A BALL. IT LOOKS LIKE HE GOT HIS ARMS UNDER THAT FOOTBALL BEFORE IT HIT THE GROUND. AL: BIG PLAY, LOOKING AT 17-SIX, 21-6. REFEREE: THE PREVIOUS PLAY IS UNDER REVIEW. KIRK: THEY WILL TAKE A PEEK TO SEE IF HE GOT HIS FOREARMS UNDERNEATH THE FOOTBALL. AL: WHAT IS YOUR INITIAL ASSESSMENT? >> HE DOES GET CONTROLLED WITHIN THE BALL HITS THE GROUND AND THE BALL MOVES IN HIS HANDS. THIS SHOULD BE IN INCOMPLETE AL: SO UNDERNEATH FALLS ON THE GROUND THERE. OK. INTERESTING. KIRK: TERRY AND THE BOYS AT THE BIG BOX. I DO NOT SEE THE MOVEMENT THE WAY TERRY DOES. AND MAYBE I AM IN ALL OF THE COVERAGE OF HOW GOOD A PLAY HE MADE ON THAT FOOTBALL. THE RULING ON THE FIELD WAS IN INTERCEPTION. THEY WOULD HAVE TO REVERSE THAT. AND DOES THE GROUND HELP THEM CONTROL IT IS THE QUESTION. >> THE PREVIOUS SHOT WE SHOWED WAS THE BEST. YOU SAW PRETTY SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT WHEN THE BALL HIT THE REFEREE: AFTER REVIEWING THE PLAY, THE BALL HIT GROUND. THEREFORE, INCOMPLETE PASS, AL: THE MINUTE WE START TALKING ABOUT IT AT 14-6, NOW WE ARE 17-6 WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER. MEANWHILE, WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS A FOURTH DOWN. THAT WAS A THIRD AND 2. NOW THE FIELD GOAL COMES OUT AND YOU HAVE A 43 YARD ATTEMPT COMING UP FOR BRANDON MCMANUS, SEVERAL GOOD YEARS FOR HIM IN DENVER, 10TH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE. REFEREE: 36 SECONDS, 3-6. AL: HAS A SUPER BOWL RING WITH THE BRONCOS WHEN HE KNOCKED OFF THE PANTHERS BACK IN SUPER BOWL A 43 YARD ATTEMPT HERE. SEEMS TO GET THE BALL WHEN WE START THE SECOND HALF. AND THAT ONE IS TRUE AND MAKES IT AN 11 POINT GAME. KIRK: THEY'RE ABLE TO GET THOSE THREE POINTS. LET'S LOOK AT OUR NEXT GEN STATS., POWERED BY AWS THE BIG EMPHASIS WITH THAT KNEE WAS TO GET THE BALL OUT QUICKLY FOR TREVOR LAWRENCE. SOMETHING HE EXCELS AT ANYWAY. SECOND-FASTEST IN THE LEAGUE ON HIS AVERAGE AT 2.39. YOU CAN SEE 2.36 SECONDS TO THROW, SO HE IS BACK THERE, GETTING THE BALL OUT. SECOND-FASTEST AVERAGE HE HAS HAD HIS ENTIRE CAREER. SO HE IS SEEING IT, AND THEY PUT TOGETHER A GREAT PLAN FOR HIM TO BE ABLE TO GET THE BALL OUT AND FIND MATCHUPS. AL: NO ONE IS MORE FRUSTRATED WITH HIMSELF AND CAM JORDAN. MOST SACKS BY AN ACTIVE PLAYER. HE SAID, I WILL NEVER CATCH THEM, THESE QUARTERBACKS ARE GETTING RID OF THE BALL INTO .5 SECONDS, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? KIRK: ALL HE CAN DO IS TRY TO KNOCK IT DOWN. IT IS SO CLOSE. AL: SO THE SAINTS, WHO HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS, WILL GET THE BALL AT THE 25 DOWN BY 11 AND 32. KIRK: THE JAGS ARE ON THE ROAD, MINUS TWO WITH A TURNOVER, AND THEY HAVE SHORT FIELDS, AND HERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW UP 11 AS THE SAINTS OF OFFENSE OF STRUGGLES CONTINUE -- THE SAINTS' OFFENSIVE STRUGGLE CONTINUES. AL: 11 TO 21 FOR JUST 100 YARDS. LOOK OUT. LOSES THE BALL, BUT IT IS PICKED THEY MAINTAIN POSSESSION. ALMOST A TOTAL DISASTER. CAMERON IRVING COMES UP WITH A LOOSE BALL TO RETAIN POSSESSION AND THE CLOCK KEEPS ROLLING. REFEREE: FOURTH DOWN PLAY, FUMBLE, RECOVERED THE BALL. THE BALL WILL BE RETURNED TO THE SPOT AS A FUMBLE. KIRK: YOU TALKED ABOUT TRYING TO GET TO THE PASS RUSH YEAR, JOSH ALLEN GETS THERE, ENDS UP FINISHING IT, SO YOU GET A QUARTERBACK TO HOLD ONTO THE THAT IS WHAT CAN HAPPEN. AL: THEY WIND THE CLOCK AGAIN IN THE SAINTS SAY, ENOUGH. THEY WILL REGROUP. THEY WILL TRY TO DROP IT OVER AT THE HALF, I FIND OUT WHAT IS GOING ON. 17-6 COMING BACK FROM THE BREAK. STATE FARM HALFTIME SHOW. STICK THE SAINTS WILL GET THE BA SEE IF THEY CAN MUSTER SOMETHING OFF IN SIBLEY WE START THE SECOND HALF. JAGS LOOKING FOR THEIR FOURTH STRAIGHT WIN. SAINTS TRYING TO GET ABOVE -- 500. TO THE FIELD TO GO, KAYLEE. KAYLEE: WHAT HAVE YOU IDENTIFIED AS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM CHALLENGING YOUR OFFENSE? >> WE HAVE TO WIN SITUATIONAL FOOTBALL, TO BE ABLE TO SCORE POINTS, CONVERT ON THIRD DOWN, KICK A FIELD GOAL. IT IS LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WE HAVE TO DO TO GIVE OURSELVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO WIN A GAME. KAYLEE: WHAT ADJUSTMENTS WILL WE SEE IN THE GAME? >> IT IS ALL ABOUT EXECUTION. IT IS LIGHT,R.C. SAID TO THE OFFENSE, LET'S MAKE PLAYS THAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF MAKING. THAT IS WHAT IT IS ABOUT. AL: KAYLEE WITH DENNIS ALLEN. COMING BACK TO MAKE THAT CATCH, TURNING TO THE OUTSIDE. CARR PUT IT RIGHT ON THE MONEY, GAIN OF 15. KIRK: THERE'S EXECUTION YOU LIKE TO SEE FROM DEREK CARR, ONE OF HIS TOP RECEIVERS, OLAVE. HE GOT IT OUT WITHOUT A HITCH AND DELIVERED THE FOOTBALL. IN RHYTHM. AL: NOTHING. RIGHT THERE, KAMARA TONIGHT ON THE GROUND. ACTUALLY DOING A GREAT JOB DEFENDING NINE TOTAL YARDS. IT CARRIES. AND IT IS OFFENSE OF LINE. IT HAS NOT SPENT A LOT OF TIME PLAYING TOGETHER. I AM SURE THE COMMUNICATION OF MOVEMENT UP FRONT HAS BEEN AFFECTED. THEY ARE FREEING UP THOSE LINEBACKERS TO COMPLETELY TAKE AWAY THE THREAT FOR THE RUN GAME. AL: SECOND AND 9. HE CHASES, GETS IT AWAY. CATCHES MADE AT THE 45. MOREAU, HERNDON. SO THIRD DOWN AND 4 FOR THE SAINTS. KIRK: WHEN THEY HAVE HAD PRESSURE THEY HAVE DISGUISED IT THIS TIME HE DOES NOT COME UP WITH A SACK, BUT JUST BY DISGUISING IT, PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE QUARTERBACK, ABLE TO CHECK IT DOWN. A GOOD JOB BEING ABLE TO IMPROVISE. AL: A LITTLE SHORT OF THE FIRST NOW AT THE 48 YARD LINE, DECISION TIME, FOURTH AND 1, 2 MINUTES IN TO THE THIRD QUARTER. KIRK: ONE OF NINE NOW ON THIRD DOWNS, THIS IS ABOUT HALF A YARD. WE ALWAYS SEE THAT SNEAK. DEREK CARR, SEE IF HE'S GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT ONE. AL: ONE FOR TWO ON FOURTH DOWN. GOING FOR IT. THEY GET IT. AT THE 34 YARD LINE. THEY NEEDED ONE AND THEY GET 17. KIRK: GARCIA PULLS AROUND, DOES A NICE JOB. WATCH 73 GET A BLOCK RIGHT HERE, OPENS IT UP LEFT SIDE COLLAPSES THERE YOU GO. SHORT YARDAGE DEFENSE. THAT FIRST INITIAL SURGE. KHMER HAS A LOT OF ROOM. -- KAMARA HAS A LOT OF ROOM. AL: WIDE OPEN BUT HE GETS ABOUT SIX BEFORE THE TACKLE IS MADE, SECOND DOWN. KIRK: GO BACK TO THE DEFENSIVE PLAN BY MIKE CALDWELL, GOING UP AGAINST AN OFFENSE STRUGGLING WITH CONSISTENCY, YOU WANT TO MAKE THEM DRIVE THE LENGTH OF THE FIELD TO EARN IT. THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING. FORCING THE BALL TO BE THROWN UNDERNEATH. AL: THAT MEANS OF COURSE -- FLANKED BY JAMAAL WILLIAMS. KEEPS IT. HILL COMES IN. BACK COMES CARR. KIRK: YOU KNOW CHANCES ARE HE'S GOING TO HOLD ONTO THE FOOTBALL. THEY ARE IN POSITION AND THEN BANG. YOU TALK ABOUT A WAY TO TRY TO IGNITE AN OFFENSE, RUNS LIKE THIS WHETHER IT IS THE RUNNING BACK OR ESPECIALLY THE QUARTERBACK RUNNING OVER TOP OF DEFENDERS, PICKING UP FIRS DOWNS. AL: PRETTY VALUABLE ASSET. CISCO AT THE END OF THE PLAY. 23 YARD LINE. NOTHING THERE. THROWS IT INTO THE GROUND. IT IS INCOMPLETE. CISCO FORCING THE THROW, SECOND AND 10. KIRK: THIS IS JUST GOOD AWARENESS. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE SEEN THIS ANSWER? THEY ARE TRYING TO SET UP A SCREEN. I THINK THEY TIP THEIR HAND TO DEFENSE GETS OUT. ALMOST WAITING FOR IT. YOUTH SEE HIM, THROW IT, I WILL CATCH IT. AL: CARR IN THE MIDDLE. POTENTIAL FLAG AT THE 32 YARD MOREAU. COVERED BY LLOYD. HERE IS LAND CLARK. >> HOLDING. OFFENSE NUMBER 75. 10 YARD PENALTY, SECOND DOWN. AL: NUMBER ONE PICK IN 2015, IN HIS NINTH SEASON. KIRK: THEY ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE LEFT TACKLE SPOT. THE FIRST ROUNDER FROM A COUPLE YEARS AGO HAS BEEN THE GUY. NOW THEY HAVE TRIED TO FIND NEW ANSWERS. TODAY IT IS PETE, TRYING TO HOLD UP ON AN ISLAND. PULLS THEM DOWN BY THE FRONT OF THE JERSEY. REMEMBER WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THEY SELF-DESTRUCTED WITH PENALTIES, THINGS TO GET BEHIND THE -- AL: ONE MORE SECOND ON THE CLOCK FOR WHAT THAT'S WORTH. NINTH PLAY OF THE DRIVE. SECOND AND 20. TO THE OUTSIDE, NOBODY' TO THE OUTSIDE, NOBODY'S HOME. NOBODY. >> THE FACT HE WAS NOT UNDER PRESSURE IS TELLING ME THERE WILL NOT BE A POTENTIAL GROUNDING. THIS DRIVE IS REALLY A MICROCOSM OF THE SEASON. MOVING THE BALL, MOVING THE BALL, HOLDING CALL. SECOND AT 20. FOLLOW IT UP WITH A PASS TO AL: RUNNING INTO A STONE WALL. CAUGHT INSIDE THE 30 SO AT LEAST HE WILL SET UP A FIELD GOAL. MOREAU MAKING THE CATCH, JENKINS IS THERE WITH HERNDON. IT WILL BE FOURTH AND 10. THEY WILL TRY TO MAKE IT A ONE POSSESSION GAME AGAIN. A MICROCOSM, MOVE IT, STOP. KIRK: THERE IS THE FRUSTRATION AGAIN FROM DEREK CARR. MAKES ME WONDER. APPEARED TO THROW IT TO NOBODY. DID NOT CHECK WITH THAT BLITZ. THEY GOT IT TOO FAR. AL: GUYS WANT TO PLAY THAT. KIRK: MICAH PARSONS SAID I'M IN. I WILL TAKE TYREEK HILL. AL: IMAGINE TYREEK HILL IN FLAG FOOTBALL. KIRK: GOT TO BE AN INTERNATIONAL RULED. THIS IS WHAT I THINK CREATED THE FRUSTRATION. YOU GET A BLITZ. HE WANTS TO THROW OUT HERE TO KAMARA CONTINUES DOWNFIELD. DID NOT SEE THE BLITZ. HE REALIZED WHAT JUST HAPPENED AND SAID THAT ONE IS ON ME. HE WENT TO THE SIDELINE AND TALKED TO DEREK CARR. THAT WAS ON SECOND AND 20 BEFORE THE COMPLETION ON THIRD DOWN. HE WENT OVER TO TALK TO HIM. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THESE GUYS TRYING TO WORK OUT THE KINKS OF THIS OFFENSE. AL: THE PLAY BLOWN DEAD. KIRK: WE HAVE SEEN DEREK CARR MORE ANIMATED AND FRUSTRATED THE LAST TWO WEEKS THEN WE HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME WHEN HE WAS WITH THE RAIDERS. AL: VERY MUCH SO. >> FALSE START, OFFENSE. NO FIRST DOWN. AL: HE GOT FRUSTRATED TOWARD THE END OF LAST YEAR IN LAS VEGAS. HE WINDS UP GOING BACK WITH DENNIS ALLEN. HE STARTED AS A ROOKIE IN 2014. KIRK: THAT'S RIGHT. AL: SO IT IS FIRST AND 15 NOW. QUICK THROW TO THE OUTSIDE. ABOUT A FOUR YARD PICKUP. CALVIN RIDLEY WAS WITH ATLANTA. HE WAS OUT ALL OF LAST YEAR. HE WAS IN A GAMBLING SITUATION. HE TALKED ABOUT IT VERY OPENLY. TALKED TO THE ATHENS JOURNAL ABOUT IT, DEPRESSION. A TERRIBLE MISTAKE, GOT TRADED TO JACKSONVILLE, HERE HE IS. KIRK: HE IS FINDING HIS ROLE WITH AN OFFENSE THAT HAS A LOT OF FIREPOWER. WHEN JONES COMES BACK, INGRAM, RIDLEY, KIRK, NTN, THEY ARE LOADED -- ETIENNE, THEY ARE LOADED. AL: AT THE 20 YARD LINE, TIM NES, RECIPIENT ON THE FAKE PUNT EARLIER. THIRD DOWN. KIRK: AS BAD AS THIS HAS BEEN FOR THE SAINTS OFFENSE, THE JAGS HAVE TO BE CAREFUL LETTING HIM HANG AROUND. ONE THING DOUG PEDERSON TOLD US IS HE IS TRYING TO TEACH HIS TEAM HOW TO BE A WINNER, HOW TO HANDLE SUCCESS. WHEN YOU HAVE A TEAM THAT IS NOT PLAYING WELL YOU NEED TO BURY THEM, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT. AL: THIRD AND SIX. ETIENNE INSIDE, HANDOFF CLOSE. A LITTLE BIT SHORT. I THINK WARNER MAKES THE TACKLE, FOURTH AND INCHES. DOES PETERSON WANT TO GAMBLE? IT IS ONE OF THOSE LOOKS. KIRK: IF HE HAD A HEALTHY 16 HE PROBABLY SNEAKS IT AND GET IT. THEN AGAIN, WITH A FAKE PUNT LAST TIME. HEADS ARE ON A SWIVEL. AL: LATTIMORE IS LINED UP NOW ON THE LEFT SIDE. NOT A MOMENT FOR THE PUSH EITHER. HERE IS LOGAN COOKE. NO FAKE THIS TIME. BOOMING KICK. BEAUTIFUL. OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 15 YARD THAT IS A 53 YARD MATCHUP AS WE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. THIS JAGUAR'S DEFENSE, THEY HAVE SAT BACK, TAKING NOTES, BUT THEY ARE PLAYING FOOTBALL WELL. YOU HAVE TO APPRECIATE HOW THEY ARE GETTING THEIR HEADS TURNED AROUND AND LOCATING THE GETTING IN POSITION TO KNOCK THE BALL AWAY. MAKING IT THAT MUCH TOUGHER ON CARR AND THIS OFFENSE TO FIND THEIR RHYTHM. AL: START FROM THE 13 HERE. RUNNING BACK IS WILLIAMS. HE GETS IT. GETS NOTHING. IT IS STUFF TO THEIR. RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE, NUMBER 94 GETS THE STOP. KIRK: THIS IS WHY IT IS TOUGH TO RUN. YOU WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL TO TAKE PRESSURE OFF THIS OFFENSIVE LINE. BUT LOOK WHAT YOU ARE DEALING THE OUTSIDE LINEBACKERS WALKED WHEN EVERYONE IS COVERED, YOU HAVE THOSE LINEBACKERS FLYING DOWNHILL AND THEY ARE JUST RUNNING INTO A WALL. AL: THROW, NO GOOD. INTENDED FOR MICHAEL THOMAS WHO AT LEAST IS HEALTHY THIS YEAR. HE HAS PLAYED 10 GAMES IN THREE PRIOR SEASONS. KIRK: WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY THE RUNNING GAME IT IS NOT A THREAT. YOU MAKE HIM ONE-DIMENSIONAL, PUTS EVERYTHING ON THE SHOULDERS OF CARR. AND AN OFFENSIVE LINE THAT IS DOING THEIR BEST TO HANDLE THE PRESSURE. AL: CARR THIRD AND 10. STEPS UP, FIRES. THE INTERCEPTION OFF THE DEFLECTION. OLUOKUN CLOSE TO THE GOAL LINE. THEY ARE CELEBRATING AS IF HE'S IN THERE AND THEY SAY HE IS. THE TOUCHDOWN. ANOTHER BATTED BALL. KIRK: THEY HAVE BEEN FORCING CARR TO BE PATIENT. CHECK IT DOWN, CHECK IT DOWN. HE HAS. THIS TIME ON THIRD AND 10 INSTEAD OF CHECKING IT DOWN HE FORCES ONE. THEN THEY FORCED HIM TO BE IMPATIENT ON THIS THIRD DOWN. WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN THE FIRST BUT WOULD HAVE AVOIDED THE TIGHT COVERAGE, ANOTHER CONTESTED COVERAGE. OLUOKUN IS ABLE TO GET TO THE CORNER AND GET THE TOUCHDOWN FOR THE JAGS. GREAT DEFENSE ALL AROUND FROM JACKSONVILLE. AL: THE MAN WHO HAS LED THE LEAGUE IN TACKLES EACH OF THE LAST TWO SEASONS CAME OVER LAST YEAR FROM ATLANTA. GETS THE FIRST TOUCHDOWN OF HIS CAREER. AND THE EXTRA POINT IS GOOD OFF THE FOOT OF MCMANUS. 6:47 TO GO IN AN EXASPERATED SUPERDOME. BALL -- DUVALL. NOT NAMED AFTER ROBERT BUT AFTER THE COUNTY JACKSONVILLE IS IN. KAYLEE: PLAYS LIKE THAT PICK SIX ARE WHY THE JAGUARS OLUOKUN IS THE LEADER OF THE DEFENSE. JOSH ALLEN TOLD ME THE FIRE HE PLAYS WITH HIS UNBELIEVABLE AND WHEN HE SPEAKS, ALLEN SAID, I GIVE HIM NOTHING BUT EYE CONTACT BECAUSE THAT IS THE RESPECT HE HAS EARNED FROM MY EYES. AL: WE HAD A MEETING LAST YEAR. ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING MEETINGS WE HAVE HAD WITH A GUY. WENT TO YALE, PARENTS ARE FROM NIGERIA, TERRIFIC GUY. FASCINATING GUY. THIS IS THOMAS TRYING TO GET FREE. EXTRA COUPLE OF YARDS. FIRST CATCH OF THE NIGHT FOR A GUY WHO IS THE OFFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR IN 2019. KIRK: THE OTHER THING THAT STANDS OUT, THEY SAID WHEN YOUR BEST PLAYER IS YOUR HARDEST WORKER, IT SETS THE TONE FOR THE AL: SECOND AND TWO. TACKLE AT THE 40 YARD LINE. KIRK: THERE IS THE SCREEN. WE HAVE SEEN IT CALLED A FEW MORE TIMES. HAVE BEEN TRYING TO HIT THAT OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS. TIMING HAS BEEN OFF. TONIGHT KAMARA HAS HAD A COUPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO GET OUT AND MAKE SOME PLAYS. AL: 22 DRIVES WITHOUT A TD IN THIS BUILDING. SHAHEED, NEED TO USE HIM MORE GIVEN HE IS THIRD TEAM. KIRK: IN HIS SECOND YEAR, TO GET MORE AND MORE COMFORTABLE WITH HIS ROLE IN THIS OFFENSE AT THE SLOT. AL: CHANGING THE MIDDLE HILL. DARIOUS WILLIAMS TACKLES HIM. A PRICE ON THAT ONE. GAIN OF SEVEN. KIRK: WHEN YOU HEAR HE IS ABOUT TO SNAP THE BALL, THEY MOVED AND HE SWITCHES TO 33. IMAGINE WHAT THAT OFFENSIVE LINE IS DOING. A LOT OF THESE GUYS HAVE NOT PLAYED A LOT OF FOOTBALL TOGETHER. AL: AND PRAYING. THE CATCH IS MADE AND THAT IS A NICE-LOOKING DRIVE. THEY MOVE THE BALL VERY WELL. WHEN THEY GET DOWN DEEP, YES. HUGE PROBLEM. KIRK: RIGHT NOW HE IS JUST SMART TO TAKE THESE UNDERNEATH THROWS. JACKSONVILLE SITTING BACK ALMOST GIVING HIM THE SHORTER THROWS. AL: KAMARA. BREAKS DOWN. KNIFING THROUGH. THERE IS THAT MAN AGAIN. OLUOKUN. KIRK: HE CLOSES IN A HURRY. 6' 6'2", 230. THIS ENTIRE DEFENSE, WE HAD THEM LATE LAST YEAR. OLUOKUN CAME OVER LAST YEAR FROM ATLANTA. NOW HE'S IN HIS SECOND YEAR. WATCH HOW QUICKLY. HE' HE'S NOT WASTING ANY TIME OR ENERGY THE WAY HE COMES ABOUT A PLAY -- COMES UP OUT OF PLAY. AL: THE BALL AT THE 28 YARD THE TAG BY TYLER LACY. HERE COMES THE THIRD DOWN AND KIRK: A ROUGH NIGHT ON THE THIRD THIS IS WHERE JACKSONVILLE, THEY SQUEEZE UP, TAKE AWAY THE EASIER THROWS INSTEAD OF SITTING BACK. TRYING TO MAKE DEREK CARR HOLD ONTO THE FOOTBALL AND GIVE JOSH ALLEN TIME TO GET HOME. AL: THAT ONE WAS ON THE FIRST DON' DON'T GET ONE HERE EITHER. COME UP SHORT. KAMARA SETTING UP A FOURTH AND 3:30 TO GO IN THE THIRD QUARTER. KIRK: HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE SEEN THAT? EVERYTHING IS TAKEN AWAY IT IS NOT LIKE DEREK CARR IS BACK THERE, PITCH, PITCH, PITCH, HE GETS BACK THERE, ONE HITCH, IT IS HARD TO WORK THROUGH YOUR PROGRESSIONS WHEN THAT IS THE CASE. AL: DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR. LONG TIME LINEBACKER IN THE TOSS ON A FOURTH AND TWO. GETS THE FIRST DOWN. KAMARA OLUOKUN -- KAMARA SWUNG OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 16. KIRK: GOOD BLOCK. BY THE TIGHT END, KAMARA. -- BY THE TIGHT END MOREAU. HE DID NOT GRAB ONTO THE JERSEY SLOW DEVELOPING, HE GETS TO THE OUTSIDE AND HE'S ABLE TO GET UP AL: 10TH PLAY OF THE DRIVE. KAMARA STARTS ONE WAY. GOES THE OTHER. BIG MOVE. INSIDE THE 10. CAMERON IRVING BLOCK. SECOND AND FOUR. KIRK: HE SHOWS GREAT PATIENCE. PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW DOES HE STILL HAVE IT? HE LOOKS LIKE IT. HE JUST NEEDS HELP AROUND HIM. THAT TIME HE'S WORKING HIS WAY NAVIGATING THROUGH THE TEETH OF THE JACKSONVILLE DEFENSE. AL: CISCO IS DOWN, THE INJURY THE DRIVE HAS CONSUMED ALMOST FIVE MINUTES. TALKING ABOUTTHIS IS THE SECOND DRIVE. THEIR OWN 25 YARD LINE. NOT THIS TIME. STOP. THERE IS OLUOKUN AGAIN ON THAT TACKLE. THIRD AND THREE. KIRK: SO IMPRESSIVE THE WAY HE'S ABLE TO GET OFF THAT BLOCK AND MAKE THAT TACKLE AGAINST HILL. RED ZONE THE LAST TWO GAMES WHEN THEY HAVE LOST FOOTBALL GAMES, 0-5 IN THE RED ZONE. TONIGHT THEY'VE HAD A COUPLE OPPORTUNITIES, NO TOUCHDOWNS. AL: IT HAS BEEN A PROBLEM THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. KIRK: ESPECIALLY NOTICEABLE LAST WEEK IN THEIR LOSS TO HOUSTON. AL: HE TAKES IT. HILL LOOKING FOR THE FIRST DOWN SHOULD HAVE IT. WOW. HILL ON BACK TO BACK PLAYS SETS UP A FIRST AND GOAL. KIRK: FINALLY CALLING SAUNDERS THE BIG DEFENSIVE TACKLE RIGHT THEY DO ENOUGH OF A JOB. THEY TRY TO MAKE IT A FOOT RACE. HE'S ABLE JUST TO GET TO THE OUT RAN WINGARD TO GET TO THE CORNER FOR THE FIRST DOWN. AL: DEFENSIVE TACKLE LEADING THE WAY FOR YOU. FIRST AND GOAL. BATTED. ANOTHER BATTED BALL, AND THE FLAG. JOSH ALLEN CERTAINLY IN THE MIDDLE. FLAG THROWN HIS DIRECTION. FOSTER MOREAU THE INTENDED >> PERSONAL FOUL. UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS. DEFENSE NUMBER TWO. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. AL: THAT ONE ON RAYSHAWN JENKINS. KIRK: I WANT TO SHOW YOU. I KNOW IT IS A PENALTY BUT THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE, WATCH THE ROUTE. THE BALL SHOULD BE UP RIGHT HE HAS TO THROUGH THE FOOTBALL RIGHT THERE AND IT IS A OBVIOUSLY HE'S CAPABLE OF THAT. HE'S LATE HERE. JUST NOT QUITE ON THE SAME PAGE WITH HIS RECEIVERS. AL: FIRST AND GOAL. CAN THEY FINALLY GET IT IN? NOT YET. ALVIN KAMARA. SAUNDERS, WHO PLAYED THE BLOCK AND ROLL ON THE STOP. SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. TAKING DOWN TO THE END OF THE KIRK: WHO GETS OFF THE BALL QUICKER? GIVE JACKSONVILLE THE EDGE. GET INTO THE BACKFIELD, THERE IS THE LINEBACKERS. OLUOKUN CLEANING IT UP, HARD TO GET A PUSH IN THE INTERIOR. AL: KAMARA GETS JAMMED UP AT THE HALF-YARD LINE. THEY GO ANOTHER QUARTER WITHOUT A TOUCHDOWN AT HOME. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY START THE FOURTH, INSIDE THE START THE FOURTH QUARTER. THIRD DOWN AND GOAL. CARR UNDER CENTER. NO. STILL CANNOT GET IN. DEVIN LLOYD SHOVES HIM OUT. HERE WE GO AGAIN. THIS WILL BE THE 16TH PLAY OF THE DRIVE. FOURTH AND GOAL. KIRK: AS MUCH AS WE TALK ABOUT -- DEVIN LLOYD IS GROWING UP, THAT IS HIS 12 TACKLE OF THE NIGHT AND HE HAS SUCH RANGE. I FEEL LIKE HE IS STARTING TO SEE IT AND HAS THE ABILITY TO GET OUTSIDE IN A HURRY. KAMARA CANNOT GET THE EDGE AGAINST DEVIN LLOYD. KAMARA COMES OUT. TAYSOM HILL COMES IN. SAUNDERS AGAIN. DEFENSIVE TACKLE ON THE BACKFIELD. YES. THEY GET THE TOUCHDOWN. SAUNDERS AGAIN LEADING THE WAY. THE GUY HAS A NEW CAREER. KIRK: A GOOD GUY TO FOLLOW BUT GIVE CREDIT TO THE LEFT SIDE. MOREAU IS ON THE LEFT SIDE. THEY MOVED IN TREVOR PENNING. HE JUST COLLAPSED DOWN HERE AND THE BIG MAN IS ABLE TO LEAD AND THERE IS NO ONE LEFT. THAT BECOMES THE ANSWER FOR THE TAYSOM HILL. WE HAVE SEEN HIM TONIGHT. GIVES YOU THE EXTRA BLOCKER BECAUSE HIS ABILITY TO TAKE THE DIRECT SNAP AND RUN THE AL: ONE WORD DESCRIBES THAT. IT HITS THE UPRIGHT AND GOES NEVER A DULL MOMENT. THE ROOKIE KICKER. PUTTING IT THROUGH. ONE POSSESSION GAME, 24-16. ONE OF THOSE GOOD DOINKS. JOHN MADDEN COINED THAT PHRASE. IT IS THE PERFECT SOUND. THAT IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. KIRK: IF HE WOULD HAVE MISSED THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A BIG DEAL. AL: YES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN. KIRK: THE SAINTS DEFENSE HAS KEPT THEM AROUND AND KEPT THEM WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE. IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE ENTIRE GAME, THIS GAME COULD HAVE GONE SIDEWAYS IN A HURRY WITH THE TURNOVERS IN THE SHORT FIELD THAT WE HAVE SEEN. THE SAINTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO KEEP THEM IN THIS GAME. EIGHT POINTS, ONE POSSESSION. AL: 16 PLAYS, 75 YARDS ON THAT ONE. THAT IS GRINDING IT OUT. SEVEN FIRST DOWNS ON THAT DRIVE. NEAR DOWNTOWN. TREVOR LAWRENCE. 155 YARDS. HAS NOT BEEN SACKED YET. START ON THE GROUND. ETIENNE TOOK AN EXTRA MOMENT TO MAKE SURE HE HAD THE BALL SECURED. KIRK: THAT JETS SWEEP ACTION. ALL YOU ARE TRYING TO DO IS GET THE DEFENSE TO TAKE A COUPLE STEPS THIS WAY OFF THE EDGE. JUST A COUPLE STEPS DOWN, WHICH THEY DO. YOU PICK UP A NICE BLOCK ON THE EDGE BY THE RECEIVER, TIM JONES. WITH THE SPEED AND ACCELERATION OF ETIENNE, HE GETS TO THAT CORNER EMMA KRONNER HE. YOU GET POSITIVE YARDS. AL: A COUPLE OF TOUCHDOWNS. MOVING AWAY. HE'S GOING TO RUN FOR THE THIRD TIME TONIGHT. SURE EVERYBODY ON THE BENCH WANTED HIM TO GO OUT OF BOUNDS. HE SAID NO, I'M GOING TO GET AS MUCH AS I CAN HEAR. KIRK: THE SAINTS START TO TAKE MORE CHANCES. WE TALKED ABOUT LAWRENCE. GOING STRAIGHT IS NO PROBLEM. BUT THIS, AROUND THE OTHER WAY, THAT GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN. NO ILL EFFECTS AT ALL. THAT'S WHAT HE'S ABLE TO DO WHEN HE'S HEALTHY. WHEN THINGS ARE NOT THERE, HE TAKES A HALF PLAY AND MAKES IT A GOOD PLAY. AL: SECOND AND SIX. DEFENSE RIGHT THERE. ETIENNE TAKEN DOWN FOR A TWO YARD LOSS. KIRK: THEY WIN THE LINE OF NOT JUST ROACH. LOOK HOW THEY ARE GETTING DOWNHILL. THEY ARE NOT WAITING. THEY ARE EXPECTING THE JAGS TO WORK AROUND THE FOOTBALL. YOU SEE WARNER FLYING DOWN TO STOP THE RUNNING GAME AGAINST ETIENNE. AL: JOHNSON IN THE GAME. HE STAYS IN TO BLOCK. HE PEELS OFF. LAWRENCE GETS TAKEN DOWN. BY ZACK BAUN. SO THE PRESSURE PUT ON AND IT IS AND THE CROWD COMES TO LIFE. KIRK: THEY STARTED TO COME TO LIFE AFTER THE TOUCHDOWN. I THINK THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR JOE WOODS, THE JOB HE'S DOING, IT'S A GOOD OFFENSE THEY ARE FACING. THEY ARE MIXING UP LOOKS AT THE RIGHT TIME ESPECIALLY ON THIRD CREATING CONFUSION UP FRONT. AL: LOGAN COOKE. HIS FOURTH PUNT OF THE NIGHT. PLUS ONE SUCCESSFUL FAKE. NICE BOOT TO THE 70 YARD LINE. EARLY IN THE FOURTH. EIGHT POINT GAME. REALLY GOOD MATCHUP WATCHING JOSH ALLEN AGAINST PETE. GIVE PETE A LOT OF CREDIT. HE HAS NOT GIVEN UP ANY SACKS. HE'S HOLDING HIS OWN. I WONDER IF COMING INTO THIS GAME, ON AN ISLAND WHERE HE HAD NOT PLAYED A LOT OF FOOTBALL THIS YEAR, HOW HE WOULD HOLD UP. HE'S DOING OK. JOSH ALLEN HAS HAD A MONSTER YEAR. AL: SEVEN SACKS IN THE SIX GAMES TO THIS POINT. ETIENNE ON THE BENCH. LOOKING FOR ASAP ON HIM. KAMARA GOING NOWHERE. KIRK: WATCH 33 AND 23. THEY ARE ALL OVER THE RUN GAME. AL: CARR. LOBBING. TO THE 11 YARD LINE. WILLIAMS IS THERE. DEEP IN THEIR OWN TERRITORY, THIRD AND FIVE. BIG PLAY, YOU DON'T MAKE IT, LIKELY JACKSONVILLE GETS A SHORT FIELD OR. GOES DEEP, NOT EVEN CLOSE. FOURTH AND FIVE. KIRK: AGAIN A THIRD DOWN WITH A FRUSTRATED DEREK CARR. YOU SEE A LOT OF A -- YOU SEE OLAVE. A SPEEDSTER. HE GIVES UP. I THINK HE JUST EXPECTED, HE SAID WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU SEE A LOT OF THAT ALL YEAR. AL: LINE DRIVE PUNT. IT TAKES A GOOD NEW ORLEANS BOUNCE. EAT WATCHING THAT ON THE PLANE WHEREVER YOU ARE GOING. COLUMBUS RIGHT? KIRK: COLUMBUS, FOR COLLEGE GAME DAY. BACK TO TALLAHASSEE FOR FLORIDA STATE AND DUKE. AL: EASY WEEKEND FOR YOU. ETIENNE IS BACK, HE FLIPS THE BALL BACK HERE. KIRK: I LOVE THIS GUY, CARL GRANDERSON. WHEN YOU WATCH HIM ON DEFENSE, HE REALLY SHOWS UP AND PLAY IS SO SMART. THIS TIME HE'S WATCHING, ANTICIPATING, THINKING ABOUT TREVOR LAWRENCE POTENTIALLY COMING AROUND. INSTEAD HE GETS THE REVERSE. AL: MORE STUFF ON THE SIDELINE. THAT KIND OF NIGHT. LAWRENCE GOING DEEP. ALONG THE SIDELINE. THE CATCH, RIDLEY, THE OFFICIALS CHECK IT OUT. THEY ARE GOING TO CALL IT. IT LOOKS LIKE THE JAGUARS WERE COMING UP TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE COMING UP TO MAKE SURE THEY DID NOT REVIEW IT. KIRK: THAT BALL LOOKS OUT OF BOUNDS. AL: IT IS. WAITED FOR THE CALL. JAGUARS THOUGHT IT WAS A CATCH. THEY ARE GOING TO REVIEW. THIRD AND 11. KIRK: HE CAME REALLY CLOSE TO MAKING ONE OF THE BEST CATCHES WE HAVE SEEN IN SIX WEEKS, PLUS ONE GAME OF THE YEAR. THE ONE-HANDED GRAB. A GREAT THROW. AL: THIRD DOWN AND 11. FIRED TOO HIGH. NO GOOD. ON THE FLAG. THERE IS THE FLAG ON A PASS INTENDED FOR AGNEW. KIRK: THE SAINTS ARE OUT THERE STATING THEIR CASE THE BALL WAS NOT CATCHABLE. >> DEFENSE, NUMBER 29. KIRK: IT IS AMAZING WITH ALL THESE RECEIVERS. TREVOR LAWRENCE HAS LOOKED UP AGNEW A LOT. HERE HE IS WORKING FROM A CONDENSED FORMATION. WORKS OUT AND THEN BACK IN. ONE THING THE SAINTS HAVE HAD A LOT OF HIS INTERFERENCE CALLS WITH THE WAY THEY PLAY. ALL YEAR THIS YEAR. SUCH TIGHT COVERAGE. AL: THAT IS THE 14TH PENALTY OF THE SEASON AGAINST THE SAINTS. FOR ILLEGAL CONTACT. IN THAT CATEGORY, ALL THREE CATEGORIES, DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY JACKSONVILLE HAS? ZERO. KIRK: I WOULD SAY IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE WAY DENNIS ALLEN PLAYS. HE IS AS AGGRESSIVE AS ANYBODY IN THE LEAGUE. THEY ARE IN THE FACE OF THE RECEIVERS A LOT OF TIMES. AL: THERE IS ETIENNE. EXPLOITS THAT SMALL OPENING. SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN. TAKING TIME OFF THE CLOCK. THE STOP, UNDER NINE MINUTES TO THIRD AND ONE. AL: I WOULD SAY PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS. BUT I CAN FIGURE THEM OUT. LUNGES. JUST A LITTLE SHORT. A DEPOT IS THERE -- ADEBO IS KIRK: HOW ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL EFFORT BY ETIENNE? PENETRATION FORCES HIM TO BOUNCE IT TO THE OUTSIDE. LOOKS LIKE HE MAY GO DOWN THERE WITH ADEBO. GETS HIS HAND WITH THE BALANCE. HE DOES NOT EQUATE GET THE FIRST CLOSE -- DOES NOT QUITE GET THE CLOSE. AL: INTERESTING CALL, FOURTH AND INCHES. YOU DO NOT MAKE IT YOU GIVE THE SAINTS THE BALL NEAR MIDFIELD. THEY CAN MAKE IT AND TAKE MORE TIME OFF THE CLOCK. HE TRIED TO GET HIM. GOING TO BE SHORT. THAT SAINTS DEFENSE IN THE MIDDLE STEPS UP WHEN THEY HAVE TO. HUGE STOP IN AN EIGHT POINT KIRK: NATHAN SHEPHERD LOOKED LIKE HE MADE THE PLAY 93. HE'S TRYING TO PUSH TO HELP. THE QUARTERBACK SNEAK OBVIOUSLY THE PLAY YOU WOULD GO WITH BUT WITH THE KNEE INJURY YOU TAKE THAT AWAY. KIRK: THE SAINTS ARE FIRED UP. THEY HAVE GIVEN THEIR OFFENSE A IT WAS 93, WATCH HIM WORK, ENGAGE, LOOK INTO THE BACKFIELD, PUSH, AND STOP HIM RIGHT HERE. IF YOU ARE JACKSON YOU ARE THINKING, MAN, NOT HAVING OUR QUARTERBACK HEALTHY, NOT A GREAT EXCHANGE. SLOW DEVELOPING PLAY. THE SAINTS ARE ABLE TO RALLY. AL: EXACTLY. KAMARA IS THE BACK. CARR WITH AN OPPORTUNITY DOWN BY EIGHT. 47 YARD LINE. HAS TIME, THROWS, CAUGHT. EMMITT THOMAS AT THE 35 -- AND THOMAS AT THE 35 YARD LINE. THEY COME UP TO THE ART OF SCRIMMAGE -- THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AT THE 36. AND THE CATCH. JUST LIKE THAT THE SAINTS AT THE 17 YARD LINE. KIRK: NICE JOB THROWING. HE GETS BACK. BOTH THROWS, THIS TIME HE READ JENKINS WHO CAME DOWN FROM THE SAFETY SPOT. THROUGH PERFECTLY. AL: CARR TO THE END ZONE. MICHAEL THOMAS REACHING FOR IT. IS HE IN BOUNDS OR OUT? BUSTER BROWN IS THERE. WHAT A CATCH. KIRK: THIS TOWN, THIS STADIUM, THEY HAVE BEEN WAITING. THREE PLAYS AND A TOUCHDOWN. THOMAS WAKES UP AND MAKES TWO BIG PLAYS FOR THIS SAINTS OFFENSE. DOES HE GET DOWN? THAT IS A TOUCHDOWN. AL: THE OLD JOHN MADDEN LINE, ONE KNEE EQUALS TWO FEET. THAT ENDS THE PLAY. THE TWO-POINT CONVERSION TRY TO TIE THE GAME. KIRK: KEEP AN EYE OUT. AL: JAMAAL WILLIAMS THE RUNNING THERE IS HILL. KAMARA COMING TO THE INSIDE. KAMARA, TIE GAME. THAT IS A LEAP AND A HALF. HE'S GOING TO GET TO THE SECOND ROW. KIRK: THAT IS THE BEST THIS OFFENSE HAS LOOKED. SAVED IT FOR THE BEST TIME IN THE GAME, THE TOUCHDOWN ON THE PREVIOUS DRIVE TO GET THE BALL BACK AFTER A STOP. THEY DO NOT MAKE IT ON FOURTH BOY DID NEW ORLEANS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GREAT FIELD WATCH THE QUARTERBACK. PITCH, FALLS OUT, HELPS THE OFFENSIVE LINE. THE TEMPO, THE QUICK RELEASE. MICHAEL THOMAS REMINDING THE NFL COMMUNITY AROUND THE COUNTRY, 13 STILL MAKES BIG PLAYS FOR THE AL: HIS FIRST TOUCHDOWN OF THE KAMARA WITH A TWO POINTER. AT 24,9, YOU ARE GOING, NO WAY, BUT THEY LOOK AWFUL. AND THEN YOU GO THREE PLAYS, 51 SECONDS. KIRK: THIS PLACE IS ALIVE NOW. AL: CROWD GOES WILD. AND NOW JACKSONVILLE ALL OF A SUDDEN VICTORY IN THEIR HIP POCKET. TIED GAME. 6:38 TO GO. KIRK: I SAID TO YOU EARLIER, WE FOCUSED ON THE SAINTS AND WHAT THEY NEED TO DO, BUT THIS JACKSONVILLE TEAM THINKS THEY WILL BE A POSTSEASON TEAM. THEY ARE STILL A YOUNG TEAM LEARNING HOW TO BE A WINNING FOOTBALL TEAM. A 24-9 LEAD, AND NOW THEY WILL HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT TO GET OUT OF HERE WITH A WIN. AL: PUT THEIR FOOT OFF THE GAS THEY WILL TRY TO DO IT AGAIN HERE, FOUR YARD PICK UP, MAYBE FIVE TO EVAN INGRAM, CLOSE TO THE 30 YARD LINE. THEY MAKE A TACKLE. KIRK: I THOUGHT TO COMING INTO THE NIGHT, THE MATCHUP FAVORED JACKSONVILLE'S OFFENSE WITH CHRISTIAN KIRK IN THE SLOT AND WOULD BE SURPRISED TO SEE THEM CREATE MATCHUPS AND TRY TO GET HIM ISOLATED, HE AND EVAN INGRAM BOTH. AL: LAWRENCE. HE WILL RUN AGAIN. A LOT OF ROOM. THERE HE GOES. WHAT A NIGHT HE HAS HAD AS A RUSHER. SPRAINED KNEE, NO PRACTICE, DID NOT TAKE ANY CONTACT, AND TONIGHT HE HAS CARRIED THE BALL FIVE LINES FOR 63 YARDS. KIRK: LOOK AT THE LINEBACKERS, THE LAST THING THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT HIS TREVOR LAWRENCE RUNNING. THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME IT HAS CAUGHT UP TO THEM. WE HAVE HEARD ALL WEEK, IS TREVOR GOING TO PLAY? HE HAS THAT KNEE, PROBABLY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE MUCH. WORMLEY, YOU ARE AWARE OF HIM BUT TONIGHT THEY ARE NOT CONCERNED. THEY PLAY MAN UNDERNEATH AND THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT HOME TO TAKE 16. AL: THAT WAS A 23 YARD GAME. FLIPPING IT TO RIDLEY. AND HE CANNOT GET AROUND THE OUT OF BOUNDS. KIRK: MARCUS MAY READ THIS FROM THE BEGINNING. HE LOOKED -- WATCH HIS EYES AND AWARENESS TO SAY, HE HAS TO TAKE OFF. REALLY, HE COULD COVER GROUND. HE IS VERY FAST. MAY ASK A GREAT PLAY THAT TIME BY NOT GETTING LONG TO SLEEP. YOU WANT TO FLY THE BALL THE OTHER WAY, BUT HE STAYED HOME AND WAS PATIENT. AL: IN ANGER COULD NOT BLOCKING. -- EVAN INGRAM COULD NOT BLOCK IN THERE FOR RIDLEY. THIRD AND 10. OUT OF PLAY. 4:43. EVERYBODY HAS GOT IT ROLLING, TWO MINUTE WARNING. 24-24 GAME. THIRD DOWN AND 10. DEEP DRIVE, DEEP THROW. RIDLEY THE INTENDED RECEIVER. ADEBO THERE, AND THE SAINTS' DEFENSE HOLDS. KIRK: HERE' KIRK: HERE'S A CONDENSED FORMATION AND HE TAKES HIMSELF OUT OF THE PLAY. LOOK AT THIS ROUTE. HE IS ALMOST TO THE SIDELINE. YOU NEED SOME ROOM TO BE ABLE TO THROW YOUR RECEIVER OUT TO HIS OUTSIDE SHOULDER, BUT HE RAN HIMSELF SO CLOSE TO THE SIDELINE THAT THERE WAS REALLY NOWHERE LAWRENCE COULD PUT THE BALL. AL: LOGAN COOKE, PUNT NUMBER FIVE TONIGHT. 10 YARD LINE. 4:30 LEFT IN REGULATION. A SCORING DRIVE, THOMAS, DOWN THE RIGHT SIDELINE. AND THEN SIX POINTS. KIRK: THAT'S THE BEST THE OFFENSE HAS LOOKED IN WEEKS, AND IT WAS THREE PLAYS. IT IS SO FRUSTRATING. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF DOING. THEY HAVE GREAT INDIVIDUAL PLAYERS BUT IT IS A MATTER OF ALL COMING TOGETHER. AL: FROM THE 10. HE THROWS. IT IS DROPPED. JOSH ALLEN GOT TO CARR. INCOMPLETE, SECOND DOWN AND 10. KIRK: IT IS A GOOD JOB. THIS IS YOUR FEAR, THE WHOLE GAME IS, CAN ALLEN TURNED THE CORNER? HEY DENNIS, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF DEREK CARR? THE BALL WAS THROWN WELL ENOUGH, CONSIDERING HE GOT HIT AS SEE THREW IT. AL: HILL IS KNOCKED DOWN AT THE OLUOKUN MAKES THE STOP. GOING QUICKLY. CARR, LOOK OUT. ESCAPES. THROWS ON THE RUN. THAT TIME, OLUOKUN GLITCHING. CARR NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN BENT OVER ON THE SIDELINE, OF ALL THINGS. DOWN CARR CARR TO BOTH KNEES HE GOES. TOOK A SHOT -- DOWN TO BOTH KNEES HE GOES. CARR TOOK A SHOT. KIRK: HE WAS TRYING TO DO ANYTHING TO KEEP OLUOKUN THAT PLAY ALIVE. OLUOKUNCAME RIGHT UP KAMARA THE YOU THINK KAMARA WOULD COME OVER HERE AND PICK THIS UP, BUT HE IS READY TO TRY TO GET OUT OF THE BACKFIELD FOR A CHECK DOWN, SO NOBODY PICKS UP OLUOKUN. THERE HE IS WITH THE SPEED. YOU CAN SEE SHAHEED BREAKING THERE, BUT BY THE TIME HE SAW HIM, THAT IS A TOUGH THROW TO MAKE. AL: REACHING FOR THE GROIN. GOING DOWN. STILL DOWN. WEEK THREE, CAME BACK THE NEXT WEEK TRYING TO WORK THIS ONE WE HAVE SEEN IT THROUGH THE YEARS. A TOUGH BREAK. SO IN COMES THE PUNT GROUP, THE ROOKIE PUNTER. FOURTH OF THE NIGHT. LINE DRIVE. HE CATCHES IT ON THE RUN. HERE OVER THE FINAL 3:45 OF REGULATION? ONLY 12 PASSING YARDS IN THE AND FROM THE 46, SWINGS IT OUT TO ETIENNE. AND THEN GOES NEXT TO NOWHERE, TAKING OUT OF BOUNDS BY TAYLOR. SECOND AND 8. KIRK: WHAT I AM INTERESTED TO SEE IS WHAT PRESS TAYLOR COMES UP WITH WITH HIS PLAN HERE WITH 3:30 TO GO ON A TIED GAME, BOTH TEAMS, FULLY COMPLEMENTED AND THE TWO MINUTE WARNING IS OUT THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT POINTS AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO GET THIS AS CLOSE AS THEY CAN BUT I WOULD THINK IT IS A COMBINATION OF A COUPLE OF FIRST DOWNS, WORK THE CLOCK AND TRY TO MAKE THE SAINTS USE THOSE TIMEOUTS. AL: TAYLOR IS BACKING AWAY. THE HEAD COACH OF THE BENGALS. WHEELS TURNING, SPINNING. MIGHT BE :00 -- CLOCK OFFICIAL. REFEREE: THE GAME IS STOPPED TO CONFIRM THE TIME. LAWRENCE FIERS. THAT IS CAUGHT ON THE RUN. CHRISTIAN KIRK INSIDE THE 20 READ HE GOES, AND CHRISTIAN KIRK KEEPS THE BALL ALL THE WAY TO ABOUT THE 1-YARD LINE. THEY'RE GOING TO SPOT IT AS HE THINKS HE SCORED THE TOUCHDOWN, AND THEY'RE GOING TO CALL IT A TOUCHDOWN NOW. 44 YARDS PER CHRISTIAN KIRK. INTO THE END ZONE HE GOES. KIRK: WATCH THE ROUTE HERE AGAINST TYRANN MATHIEU. GIVE HIM THAT OPTION ROUND, BASED ON LEVERAGE TO WORK IN OR THAT IS A MISMATCH AT THIS STAGE IN TIME. KIRK HAD SUCH QUICKNESS AND A FIELD ON THE ROUTES. -- FEEL ON THE ROUTES. AL: THEY COMPLETELY STYMIED OFFENSIVELY IN THE SECOND HALF. IT TOOK 51 SECONDS TO GET THE TYING TOUCH, AND THIS TOOK SECONDS FOR TWO PLAYS. KIRK: HE GOES IN, BACK OUT AND THEN BACK TO THE INSIDE. LOOK HOW HE SEPARATES WITH A BALL IN HIS HANDS. JUST KIND OF A CRUISE' -- A PRO'S PRO IN HOW THEY GET READY FOR A GAME. AGAIN, I FELT THE MATCHUP AGAINST THE INSIDE DEFENSIVE BACKS, WHETHER IT WAS TAYLOR OR MATTHEW COMING DOWN, THAT EVENTUALLY LAWRENCE WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO HIT A BIG ONE LATE IN THE GAME. KIRK FINALLY MAKES HIS PRESENCE FELT. AL: CAMERON JORDAN CAN ONLY LOOK AT THAT REPLAY. DEREK CARR, CAN HE LEAD THEM DOWN THE FIELD AGAIN? CRAZY GAME IN SO MANY WAYS. A TOUCHDOWN AND A PICK FOR DEREK KIRK: THE ONE TIME THEY REALLY LOOKED INSYNC, THEY WERE IN THAT TEMPO MODE, AND THEY WERE GOING FAST, AND HE WAS GETTING THE BALL OUT OF HIS HANDS QUICK, AND THEY WERE THE AGGRESSOR. THE JAGS WERE SITTING BACK, LOOKING TO EACH OTHER TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE ON THE SAME PAGE, AND YOU WILL SEE WITH MORE OF THAT WITH 3:08 TO GO. AL: OVER THE MIDDLE. WIDE OPEN. CAUGHT. TACKLED AT ABOUT THE 43 KIRK: KIRK:, HILL. FINALLY AN ANSWER, THAT SPLIT SAFETY LOOK TO GET THEY GET BEHIND THE BACKERS AND IN BETWEEN THE SAFETIES. ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES WE HAVE SEEN THEM HIT A VERTICAL SHOT DOWN THE MIDDLE. AL: HIS FOURTH CATCH OF THE NIGHT. RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. TO JAGUAR TERRITORY GOES KAMARA. KIRK: THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL THING WHEN YOU HIT HILL LIKE THAT BEHIND THOSE BACKERS, THEY FINALLY START TO SINK. AND THEN YOU CAN CHECK IT DOWN TO KAMARA, AND HE HAS MORE ROOM TO WORK. AL: THEY ARE SHY INCHES. KAMARA AGAIN, FIRST DOWN. TO THE 41 HE GOES. TAKING DOWN THE TWO MINUTE WARNING. AND HD, ALL THREE TIMEOUTS. KIRK: HE HAS HAD A LITTLE BIT OF HE CHECKS OUT NOW. YOU CAN SEE JAMAAL WILLIAMS BACK IN, LOOKS BETTER DURING THE WEEK. SAMUEL, THE SAME THING. INSIDE TWO MINUTES NOW. SINCE GO TO WORK. FLIPPING OUT HERE. SHAHEED, SECOND DOWN AND SHORT. KIRK: CARR AND THIS FOURTH QUARTER, NINE OF 12, 95 YARDS AND A TOUCHDOWN. AL: KAMARA INSIDE THE 20 HE TACKLED. GAME OF 15. KIRK: BUT THE DEFENSIVE LINE TOOK THEMSELVES OUT OF THE PLAY, AND THE OFFENSIVE LINE ABLE TO GET UP TO THOSE BACKERS, GETTING KAMARA SOME ROOM. AL: CARR ESCAPES. FIERS IT AWAY. -- FIRES IT AWAY. WE HAD A LOW-SCORING GAME, WHICH HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH MAINLY THE SAINTS THIS YEAR. YOU ARE LIVING LARGE IF YOU LIKE THE UNDER, BUT NOT TONIGHT. THEY HAVE ONLY HAD ONE GAME WHERE THEY SCORED OVER 20 POINTS. AL: RIGHT. AL: SECOND AND 10. THAT IS CAUGHT, TAKING IT TO THE OLUOKUN, THIRD DOWN. --OLAVE, THIRD DOWN. KIRK: HE MOTIONED FROM THE LEFT TO THE RIGHT, WIDENED OUT DEVIN LLOYD, WHO FOLLOWED HIM AND THEN WENT UNDERNEATH ON THAT ANGLE AL: THIRD DOWN AND 2. HE HAS GOT THE FIRST. THE SIX YARD LINE. KIRK: LET'S GIVE THIS OFFENSE OF LINE CREDIT. WE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONING THEM ALL NIGHT WHEN IT COMES TO PASS PROTECTION AND THEY ARE FINALLY GETTING A LITTLE PUSH UP FRONT. AL: WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THE TIMEOUT STRATEGY. YOU REALLY DO NOT WANT TO TAKE A TIMEOUT AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO TAKE IT IF YOU ARE NEW ORLEANS EITHER AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO LEAVE JACKSONVILLE, SO EACH TEAM STILL HAS ALL OF ITS TIMEOUTS, AND THAT PASSES INCOMPLETE. IT IS ONE OF THOSE WEIRD DEALS WHERE NOBODY ONES TO REALLY TAKE A TIMEOUT. KIRK: YOU ARE RIGHT. JACKSONVILLE IS THINKING, THE WAY THEY ARE IN THE RED ZONE, LET THE CLOCK KEEP GOING. THEY ARE THINKING, WE DO NOT WANT TO GIVE TREVOR LAWRENCE ANY TIME LEFT. AL: THE BIG QUESTION IS IF NEW ORLEANS GETS INTO THE END ZONE, DOES ALLEN GO FOR TWO? FIRST THINGS FIRST, SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. TIME RUNNING OUT. AVOIDS THE SACK. FIERS. SCENTED FOR HILL. YOU HAVE ALLEN GOING DOWN, ALL SORTS OF ACTION HERE. CARR GETS UP. HOBBLES A LITTLE. NEEDS A MOMENT. BENDS OVER. KIRK: THERE IS THAT MATCHUP AGAIN WITH PETE AGAINST ALLEN. WHEN CARR HAS HAD SUCCESS, IT IS NOT WHEN HE IS BACK IN THE POCKET WAITING FOR RECEIVERS TO GET OPEN, IT IS WHEN HE HAS A HITCH IN THE BALL OUT, THAT TIME HOLDING THE BALL IN THE AREA USUALLY DOES NOT LEAD TO SUCCESS FOR ANY OFFENSE, BUT ESPECIALLY THIS OFFENSE THAT HAS STRUGGLED IN THE RED AREA. AL: CARR NEEDED AN EXTRA MOMENT. SO JUST TO REGROUP, GET SETTLED, FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY WILL DO AT KIRK: WAIT, 24-NINE, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY EXPECTED THIS. AL: NO, NEW ORLEANS LOOK LIKE THEY WOULD NOT SCORE FOR A MONTH. A GAME BROKE OUT. A BONANZA BROKE OUT. THEY PUT KEITH KIRKWOOD IN THE WE HAVE BARELY SEEN HIM TONIGHT. HE GOES WIDE TO THE RIGHT. THIRD AND GOAL. TO THE END, OFF THE FINGERTIPS OF MOREAU! COULD NOT HOLD IT IN, SETTING UP A FOURTH AND GOAL. SO CLOSE. KIRK: PERFECTLY TIMED. THE EXECUTION WAS THERE. THE ONE HITCH BALL OUT. THIS COMMUNICATION BY THE JAGS. TWO DEFENDERS -- WATCH BOTH, JENKINS AND BROWN, 30 AND 2 JUST SIT UP FRONT, BIG HOLE IN THE FRONT. CARR READ IT PERFECTLY IN THE BALL IS JUST DROP. AL: THE SAINTS ARE 4-5 ON THIRD DOWN TONIGHT. ON FOURTH. FOURTH AND GOAL, FOURTH DOWN. AGAIN TO THE END ZONE. CONTACT. THE PASSES RULED INCOMPLETE. EVERYBODY WANTS IN THE STADIUM A YOU HAVE LESTER BROWN THERE WITH CHRIS OLIVA A, ALL LEGAL. AND THE JAGS BEGAN TO CELEBRATE. KIRK: WITH THE GAME ON THE LINE, YOU GO TO YOUR TOP RECEIVER AGAINST A BACKUP CORNER WHO WAS IN FOR TYSON CAMPBELL WHO HAS HELD HIS OWN TONIGHT, AND HE DOES IT AGAIN. LET'S GIVE HIM A LOT OF CREDIT, SECOND-YEAR OUT OF ARKANSAS. DOES IT GIVE THEM A LITTLE WIGGLE? TRIES TO GET AROUND AND NEVER HAS A CHANCE. BROWN PLAYED THE BALL PERFECTLY, AND HE PUT IT UP AND HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO WORK AROUND HIM BUT TO GOOD OF COVERAGE FROM BUSTER BROWN. IF ONLY THAT ONE WOULD HAVE FOUND ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE IN THE ARMS OF MOREAU. AL: THE SAINTS HAVE A COUPLE OF TIMEOUTS, BUT YOU CANNOT UNFORCED A PUNT. THAT KIND OF THE NIGHT FOR THE FIGHT BACK. MOREAU KNOWS IT WAS OFF HIS FINGERTIPS. AND THE SAINTS WILL AT LEAST TAKE A
