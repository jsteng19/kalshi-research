OF THE GREEN BAY PACKERS. THE ROOKIE KICKER -- WE SAW MASON CROSBY WITH THE CHANGING OF THE GUARD. REYNOLDS IS BACK TO RECEIVE. GREEN BAY WON THE TOSS AND DEFERRED. AND AWAY WE GO FROM LAMBEAU FIELD STARTING AT THE 25 YARD LINE. JARED GOFF, NUMBER ONE PICK IN 2016 BY THE RAMS, NUMBER ONE OVERALL PICK AND THEN TRADED TO DETROIT FOR MATTHEW STAFFORD AND A BUNCH OF PICKS. 70% COMPLETION. FIVE TDS AND TD -- AND THREW THE BALL INTO THE UPPER DECK. HE THREW A HAIL MARY TO THE CROWD. DAVID MONTGOMERY STARTS IN TH BACKFIELD. FORMER BEAR. HE GETS IT RIGHT AWAY. HE WON'T GO ANYWHERE. TAKEN DOWN BY NUMBER 91 FOR NO GAIN AND IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND 10. KIRK: JARED GOFF WAS KIND OF THE FORGOTTEN MAN IN THE TRADE WITH STAFFORD. THE RAMS WENT ON TO WIN THE SUPER BOWL AND HE SAID IT WAS HARD NOT TO TAKE IT PERSONALLY. HE HAS BATTLED THROUGH AND I WOULD ARGUE HE IS PLAYING THE BEST FOOTBALL OF HIS CAREER OVER THE LAST PART OF THE SECOND HALF OF LAST YEAR AND INTO THIS YEAR. A GREAT COMMAND IN THIS JOHNSON OFFENSE. AL: THE PLAY FAKE. THE PAST INTO THE FLAT AND NOTHING HAPPENING HERE EITHER. THE CATCH IS MADE BY RAYMOND TAKEN DOWN. A GOOD START BY THE PACKER DEFENSE AND IT IS A DOWN AND 12. KIRK: GREEN BAY'S DEFENSE ACCEPTING THE CHALLENGE THIS WEEK IN THE SHORT WEEK FROM THEIR COACH. TALKING ALL WEEK ABOUT THE PHYSICALITY OF DETROIT COMING OUT EARLY WITH A LOT OF SPEED. AL: GREEN BAY DEFENSE SHUTTING DOWN THE SAINTS IN THE SECOND HALF. THIRD AND LONG IN A TIGHT FORMATION. PACKERS RUSH FIVE. GOLF STEPS -- GOFF STEPS UP AND IS PICKED OFF BY RUDY FORD WHO TAKES IT DEEP INTO LIONS TERRITORY. GOFF WHO WENT 10 GAMES WITHOUT A PICK NOW HAS AN INTE THREE CONSECUTIVE GAMES. DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR OF GREEN BAY. THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATORS IN THE NFL MOVE AROUND GUYS AND MAKE YOU THINK AFTER THE SNAP. THEY SAT IN ZONE. NOTHING REALLY SHOULD HAVE TRICKED JARED GOFF. THERE WAS A SAFETY IN THE UNDERNEATH COVERAGE. YOU SEE JARED GOFF'S EYES WORKING AROUND. IT LOOKS LIKE HE WAS TRYING TO GET IT TO SAINT BROWN AND THROWS IT LATE OVER THE MIDDLE AND FORD IS RIGHT THERE. AL: BACK FROM INJURIES. THEY ARE IN THIS SET FROM THE 14 YARD LINE. LOVE HAS TIME. THE SECONDARY DOES ITS JOB TAKING OFF. HE HAS THE ABILITY. THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE, SECOND DOWN AND 10. JARED LOVE WAS PICKED IN THE DRAFT IN 2020. HE'S SHOCKED AARON RODGERS. HE HAD TO WAIT THREE YEARS BUT NOW HE GETS HIS OPPORTUNITY. HE SAID UTAH STATE WAS THE ONLY SCHOOL. KIRK: HE GREW UP IN THE SAME AREA AS JOSH ALLEN. AL: SECOND AND 10. HIS THIRD SACK OF THE YEAR. AL: THIRD AND 19TH. RUSH FOUR. PAST CAUGHT -- PASS CAUGHT. ROMEO DOBBS THAT CATCH AND IN COMES THE FIELD GOAL UNIT. KIRK: PRETTY GOOD JOB BY THE DETROIT DEFENSE CONSIDERING THE HOLD THEY WERE IN AFTER THAT INTERCEPTION. GOOD PRESSURE WITH THAT SACK PUTTING THEM AWAY BEHIN STICKS FORCING THE FIELD GOAL. AL: THE 34 YARD ATTEMPT. HE WAS A SIX ROUND DRAFT OUT OF AUBURN. CROSBY HAS BEEN HERE FOR THE LAST 16 YEARS. THE HOLDER IS ALSO A ROOKIE. THE TURNOVER HAS PAID OFF WITH A FIELD GOAL. THREE MINUTES INTO THE GAME AND IT IS GREEN BAY, THREE AND DETROIT NOTHING. IS HE STREAMING IT FROM YOUR ROOM? AL: THAT IS MORE ROOM, NOT MINE. KICKING OFF FOR THE SECOND TIME. CARLSON. REYNOLDS LETS IT GO. ONCE AGAIN JARED GOFF COMES OUT STARTING AT THE 25 YARD LINE. ONE KICK IN EACH OF HIS LAST THREE GAMES -- IN THE LAST 10 GAMES HE HAD 383 CONSECUTIVE PASSES WITHOUT AN INTERCEPTION. THE THIRD LONGEST OF ALL TIME. EXCEEDED ONLY BY AARON RODGERS AND TOM BRADY. KIRK: WITH DECKER BACK, ONE OF THE TOP OFFENSIVE LINES IN THE LEAGUE AND THEY HAVE TO GET THE RUN GAME GOING TONIGHT. AL: MONTGOMERY PICKS UP TWO. DAVID IS IN HIS FIFTH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE. PRESTON MAKES THE STOP, SECOND AND EIGHT. KIRK: ONE OF THE GREAT BATTLES WITHIN THE GAME WILL BE THE OFFENSIVE LINE. MAKING IT TOUGH AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. THEY HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED ALL WEEK TO MATCH THAT PHYSICALITY. AL: THE ROOKIE GIVES COMES IN -- GIBBS COMES IN, THE NUMBER 12 PICK FROM ALABAMA. THEY LOVE HIM. HE WATCHED HIM PLAY A LOT OF FOOTBALL IN COLLEGE STARTING AT GEORGIA TECH. KIRK: NICK SABIN NEEDED A BACK AND HE WENT TO TUSCALOOSA AND HAD A BRILLIANT ONE YEAR AT ALABAMA. NOT ONLY DID HE SHOW AN ABILITY TO RUN ON THE PERIMETER BUT BETWEEN THE TACKLES HE COULD GET OFF OF YARDS. HE IS A THREE DOWN BACK IN THE NFL. HE EVEN CAN LINE UP AT TIMES AS A RECEIVER. AL: THEY BRING BACK IN MONTGOMERY. AN EXTRA TIGHT END. HE THRUST FORWARD UP TO THE 36 YARD LINE FOR DOWN. KIRK: THREE TIGHT ENDS, SHORT YARDAGE YOU NEED A GOOD PUSH. IN BAY COMING OFF THE BALL, NUMBER 93 THAT TIME DOING A GOOD JOB WITH JUST ENOUGH ROOM FOR HE AND GIBBS TOGETHER ARE A FORMIDABLE DUO IN THAT BACKFIELD FOR THE LIONS. AL: GIBBS IS BACK IN. HE GETS CRUSHED AS HE MAKES THE GRAB. IT IS WALKER MAKING THE TACKLE. YOU TRY TO GET A GUY OUT IN SPACE AND THAT SPACE CLOSES QUICKLY. KIRK: I THINK WALKER IS SEEING THE GAME A LOT FASTER LIKE MOST GUYS IN THEIR SECOND YEAR. READING THE EYES AND TAKING AWAY SPACE WITH QUICKNESS. I THINK HE IS SEEING THE GAME A LOT FASTER AND REACTING MUCH QUICKER IN YEAR NUMBER TWO. AL: ANOTHER GEORGIA BULLDOG IS WALKER. TJ SLATON TAKES CARE OF DETROIT NOW WITH A THIRD DOWN. KIRK: YOU'RE USED TO COMING AND WATCHING GREEN BAY WITH KENNY CLARK MAKING A DIFFERENCE OUTFRONT BUT THEY HAVE MOVED HIM AWAY FROM THE NOSE. SLATON, YOU SEE HIM A LOT EARLY MAKING PLAYS. AL: THIRD DOWN AND 5-4 DETROIT. PACKERS ON TOP 3-0 TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE INTERCEPTION. GOFF RETREATS AND FIRE IS OVER THE MIDDLE. CAUGHT ON THE RUN. INSIDE THE 30! AND THAT IS SAM LAPORTA. A GREAT-LOOKING ROOKIE TIGHT END OUT OF IOWA WHERE THEY GROW THEM. KIRK: YOU CAN GO MAN TO MAN BECAUSE OF THE MOTION. GOFF KNOWS WHO HE WANTS TO GO TO RIGHT AWAY. SECOND YEAR, THIS BEN JOHNSON OFFENSE ESPECIALLY ON THIRD DOWN -- HE HAS A GOOD IDEA OF WHERE HE WANTS TO GO WITH THE FOOTBALL. NOT BAD COVERAGE BY DOUGLAS. ROOKIE TIGHT END HAD THE BIG PLAY LAST WEEK AND GETS THE FIRST DOWN. AL: 35 YARDS. GOFF -- SAINT BROWN MAKING THE GRAB! AMON-RA ST. BROWN -- 35, 24! LEAPING RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF SOME FANS AND DETROIT TAKES THE LEAD. KIRK: THE DIFFERENCE IS NOT THE TURNOVERS BUT HOW HE RESPONDS TO LOOK AT THE COVERAGE BY GREEN LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE COVERAGE -- A LITTLE SLIP, MAN-TO-MAN GOES DOWN AND AN EASY READ. DOUGLAS IS LOCKED UP ON BROWN BUT A NICE JOB OF RESPONDING TO THE INTERCEPTION BY JARED GOFF. AL: A 100 YARD GAME LAST WEEK AND THAT KICK IS JUST GOOD OFF THE FOOT OF RILEY PATTERSON. BACK COMES GOFF AFTER THE PICK. DETROIT 41ST TRIP IN HERE? AL: THEY HAVE TAKEN THAT TO A NEW LEVEL NOW. KIRK: DETROIT, BOTTOM RIGHT, TRYING TO GET INVOLVED IN IT. AL: A LOT OF LIONS FANS HERE TONIGHT. TAKES IT AT THE GOAL LINE. A GOOD RETURN MAN. TAKES INTO THE 20 YARD LINE. LUCAS MAKING THE TACKLE. JORDAN LOVE, THE ONE ISSUE HE HAS HAD THIS YEAR IS COMPLETION PERCENTAGES. ONLY A LITTLE OVER 50%. KIRK: A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH NOT HAVING WATSON OUT THERE AND THEY HAVE THROWN THE BALL DOWNFIELD A LOT THIS YEAR. WITH ALL OF THE YOUTH ON THE PERIMETER THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND THE RHYTHM WITH THE NEW QUARTERBACK. AL: WATSON, NUMBER NINE, SECOND-YEAR OUT OF NORTH DAKOTA STATE. HE HAD A REALLY GOOD ROOKIE SEASON. LOVE -- LOOK OUT. HE IS SWALLOWED UP AT ISAIAH BALKS ROARING HIM DOWN. KIRK: ISAIAH BUGS IS KNOWN FOR POWER BUT HE HAS SOME QUICKS TO GO WITH IT AND HE BULRUSH IS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEWMAN AND JOSH MYERS. I DON'T KNOW HOW LOVE HELD ONTO THE FOOTBALL WITH BUGGS TRYING TO KNOCK IT AWAY. AL: HE IS IN HIS FIFTH SEASON AND ONLY HIS SECOND CAREER SACK. SECOND AND 16. THE PAST IS BROKEN UP -- THE PASS IS BROKEN OUT. THIRD DOWN AND 16 FOR THE PACKERS. KIRK: WITH JORDAN LOVE, YOU SEE THE YOUNG QUARTERBACKS, WE HAVE SEEN A FEW PLAYING AND THE DEBATE IS, IS IT BETTER TO SIT AROUND FOR A COUPLE YEARS TO GET READY? IN HIS CASE HE GOT TO LEARN FROM A FUTURE HALL OF FAMER RODGERS. HE TALKED ABOUT THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL THAT HE LEARNED AND THE FILM STUDY. HE SAID THE GREATEST THING I TOOK AWAY FROM HIM IS HIS CONSISTENCY WITH THE DAILY PREP. WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. AL: THIRD AND 16. DEEP DROP. EVERYONE IS COVERED THE FLAG IS THE PAST IS INCOMPLETE -- THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE. >> THE RULING ON THE FIELD IS AN INCOMPLETE PASS. KIRK: RUNYON ARATHI SAW HUTCHINSON GO BY HIM. >> THE PENALTY IS DECLINED. KIRK: AND NOW, HE IS LIMPING OFF THE FIELD. A TOUGH START FOR HIM. AL: THEY ARE WITHOUT THEIR LEFT TACKLE WHO WENT ON INJURED RESERVE TODAY AND JENKINS, THE LEFT GUARD, IS ALSO OUT. KIRK: WHAT IS IMPRESSIVE IS THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OVERCOME THAT IN TWO OF THEIR THREE GAMES AND HATE SEEING RUNYON LIMPING OFF. AL: SO MANY TEAMS IN THE SAME SITUATION. THE OFFENSIVE LINE. THE WHISTLE STOPPED PLAY. KIRK: PENALTIES HURT THIS GREEN BAY TEAM LAST WEEK AND THEY WILL PUSH THEM BACK FIVE MORE YARDS. >> FALSE START, NUMBER 55. FIVE YARD PENALTY. AL: THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE NOW GOES BACK TO THE NINE. RAYMOND SETS UP AT HIS OWN 40. THE PUNTER SKIES ONE. A GOOD PUNT. BACKING UP, THEY ALMOST GAVE UP SOME POINTS AFTER THIS PICK BUT ONLY A FIELD GOAL OF. AND THEN THE TOUCHDOWN TO SAINT BROWN. A GREAT ANSWER FROM DETROIT AND THEIR QUARTERBACK JARED GOFF. A GLIMPSE INTO THE FUTURE WITH GIBBS AND SAINT BROWN. SUCH SKILL. AL: GOFF PLAYING HIS BEST HE LED THE RAMS INTO THE SUPER BOWL IN 2018. THAT PASS IS TO HYPE YOUR IF YOU LOOK AT THE TRADE AGAIN, OBVIOUSLY IT TURNED OUT GREAT FOR THE RAMS. THEY TRADED FOR STAFFORD. THEY WENT ON TO WIN THAT SUPER BOWL. BUT NOW, IF YOU LOOK TO THE FUTURE, AND GOFF'S YOUNGER THAN KIRK: WHAT A MOVE BY BRIDE HOLMES TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN -- BRAD HOLMES TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. IT IS A YOUNG TEAM GOING IN A GREAT DIRECTION AND LUCKY TO HAVE GOFF THERE. AL: SECOND AND 10, NICE BURST FOR A GAIN OF SEVEN BY GIBBS TO MAKE IT THIRD AND THREE. KIRK: I REALLY THINK CHANGED THE IMAGE. I THINK IT STARTED, THERE IS RUNYON GETTING THE ANKLE TAPED, I THINK IT STARTED A YEAR AGO WITH THE PERSONALITY OF DAN CAMPBELL COMING OUT. A LOT OF PEOPLE DID NOT KNOW A LOT ABOUT DETROIT AND DAN CAMPBELL AND HIS PERSONALITY AND WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO COMMUNICATE AND SELL WITH THE CULTURE CHANGE. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT, I WANT TO PLAY FOR THAT GUY WITH THAT KIND OF APPROACH. AL: HE WANTED TO BITE OFF THE KNEECAPS. LIKE YOU SAID IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE. JOSH REYNOLDS TO THE 30 AND A LITTLE BEYOND. REYNOLDS, FIRST FOUR YEARS AS A RAM SO HE AND GOFF BUDDIES. KIRK: GREAT CHEMISTRY. LOOKING AT SAVAGE TRYING TO BAIT GOFF WHERE HE JUMPS SAY BROWN LATE OPENING UP THE NEXT LEVEL TO REYNOLDS. A GOOD READ GETTING A BALL TO HIS GUY AT THE SECOND LEVEL. AL: AT THE 25 YARD LINE. THE HANDOFF. HE MOVES HIS WAY FORWARD. CONTACT. PICKED UP CLOSE TO NINE. KIRK: GOOD JOB BY THE LEFT GUARD, JONAH JACKSON. GREAT TO SEE HIM BACK TO THE RIGHT SIDE. THE LEFT GUARD PULLS AROUND BUT WATCH THE RIGHT SIDE GETTING THE PACKERS TURNED OPENING IT UP FOR JACKSON. AL: SECOND AND TO AND FIGHTING HIS WAY TO WHAT APPEARS TO BE A FIRST DOWN IS A MONTGOMERY STOPPED BEHIND THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE BUT KEPT THE LEGS TURNING. THE SPOT IS AT JUST ABOUT THE 15 IT WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR A KIRK: GREAT INDIVIDUAL EFFORT. I WAS WITH YOU, I THINK HE HAS GOT IT. HE WAS HIT IN THE BACK FIELD. WHAT EVER SHOWS THAT WHEN HE IS HEALTHY, WHAT HE CAN DO. THAT WAS ALL HIM PICKING UP THAT FIRST DOWN YARDAGE. AL: GOFF IS GOING TO PACK IT IN. HE GOES INSIDE THE FIVE AND IS TACKLED AT THE THREE BY RUBY -- BY RUDY. AGAIN OF 12. -- A GAIN OF 12. KIRK: THIS IS GOFF WHO DOES NOT RUN. NOT A THREAT. BUT GOOD JOB SEEING THAT OPEN UP INSTEAD OF WAITING, NO ONE ACCOUNTED FOR HIM IN THE MAN COVERAGE SO HE TOOK OFF AND GOT THE FIRST DOWN INSIDE THE FIVE. AL: 41 RUSHING YARDS FOR THE LIONS ALREADY. STUFFED AT THE LINE OF WALKER, NUMBER SEVEN, IS RIGHT THERE. KIRK: GOOD JOB OF ANTICIPATING GETTING DOWNHILL BY WALKER. HE WILL HAVE TO MAKE A TON OF TACKLES. THEIR LEADER CAMPBELL IS NOT PLAYING. YOU SEEM A GUFFEY, SPECIAL TEAMS GUY PUTTING MORE ON CLAY WALKER YOUR GOOD JOB IN THE HOLE. -- CLAY WALKER. GOOD JOB IN THE HOLE. AL: WALKER WAS THE ONLY GUY EJECTED TWICE LAST YEAR TRYING TO KEEP HIS EMOTIONS IN CHECK THIS YEAR. IN FOR THE TOUCHDOWN, DAVID MONTGOMERY! THE DETROIT LIONS THAT TIME WITH TAYLOR DECKER WHO WAS QUESTIONABLE COMING INTO THE GAME LEADING THE WAY EIGHT PLAYS FOR 55 YARDS IN A LITTLE OVER FOUR MINUTES. KIRK: WATCH HIM GET HIS BODY TURNED ON THE EDGE. THEN YOU SEE THAT FAST MOTION, THE TURBO MOTION WITH THE TIGHT END WHO USES HIS SPEED THAT EVERYONE IS USING. AND TO GET THE KICK OUT BY LEPORE. AND ANOTHER NICE DRIVE BY THIS DETROIT LION OFFENSE. AL: PATTERSON. AMAZING THE SYMMETRY IN WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE. OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS. A GUARD IN. KEYSHAWN NEXT IN. UP TO THE 21 YARD LINE HE GOES. KIRK: AN AMAZING FRANCHISE CAN HAVE TWO QUARTERBACKS AT THAT LEVEL OVER THREE DECADES. AL: IT IS ALMOST UNHEARD OF. INDIANAPOLIS THOUGHT MAYBE THEY WOULD GO IN THAT DIRECTION WITH MANNING AND THEN HE WAS HURT. AND THEN ANDREW LUCK. THAT DID NOT LAST LONG BUT THIS WAS OFF THE CHARTS. TWO UNANIMOUS FIRST BALLOT. KIRK: I LIKED YOUR COMPARISON PREGAME, THE BASEBALL COMPARISONS. AL: 21 YARD LINE. THIS IS AJAY DYLAN. WE WERE TALKING BEFORE THE GAME ABOUT --CAN WE THINK OF A PARALLEL? YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO TWO GUYS, ONE SUCCEEDS THE OTHER, JOE DIMAGGIO AND MICKEY MANTLE. THAT WOULD BE THAT TYPE OF LINE IN TERMS OF JOE DIMAGGIO HAVING A FANTASTIC CAREER AND HERE COMES MICKEY MANTLE WHOSE CAREER WAS JUST AS GOOD. KIRK: AND THAT IS FOR -- AND THAT IS HOW FAR BACK YOU HAVE TO GO AND IN A DIFFERENT SPORT. AL: AGAIN. YOU LOOK AT JORDAN LOVE WHO WAS THE NEXT GUY UP. WHO WAS THE NEXT NIGHT UP AFTER PEYTON MANNING, BOBBY MERCER WHO CAME OUT OF OKLAHOMA. KIRK: THAT IS WHAT JORDAN LOVE IS FACING. STEPPING INTO THIS ENVIRONMENT AND THE EXPECTATIONS WITH WHAT BRETT STARTED AND WHAT AARON RODGERS WENT ON TO DO AND MAYBE EVEN RAISED THE BAR WITH HIS PERFORMANCE. AL: THIRD DOWN AND THREE. IT IS RIGHT UP THE MEADOW. TOO HIGH, ALMOST PICKED. AND INCOMPLETE. A STUTTERING START FOR GREEN KIRK: HUTCHINSON WAY OFF TO THE RIGHT SIDE CREATING ONE-ON-ONE OPPORTUNITIES BACK TO THE INSIDE. HIS TACKLE TO DEFEAT HUTCHINSON BUT RIGHT NOW, DETROIT, TALKING ABOUT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE ON BOTH SIDES DETROIT WINNING IT ON BOTH GETTING GOOD PRESSURE ON JORDAN LOVE. AL: THE KICK FLOATING OVER. FAIR CATCH CALLED FOR AND MADE BY RAMIN AT THE 25 YARD LINE AND WE WILL BE BACK AT LAMBEAU FIELD IN 30 SECONDS. AL: BACK AT LAMBEAU FIELD, 14-3 LIENS ON TOP. -- LIONS ON TOP. DETROIT NOW WILL START FROM THE 25 YARD LINE. ALREADY THEIR FOURTH DRIVE. TWO HAVE CULMINATED IN TOUCHDOWNS. SHORT DROP ONE-HANDED. THAT IS JOSH REYNOLDS HAULING IT IN. THAT CONNECTION THAT STARTED SEVEN YEARS AGO WITH THE RAMS CONTINUES IN DETROIT. KIRK: ERIC STOKES HAS NOT PLAYED ALL YEAR SO YOU ARE BACKUPS. NOT BAD COVERAGE. THE RELATIONSHIP WITH GOFF AND REYNOLDS GOING BACK TO THEIR RAMS DAYS. HE HAS NATURAL CHEMISTRY. SOMEHOW JOSH REYNOLDS COMES DOWN WITHOUT FOOTBALL. AL: FINAL MINUTE OF THE QUARTER. A LITTLE RAZZLE-DAZZLE. RAYMOND WITH TONS OF ROOM, MOLY RAYMOND DOWN THE SIDELINE AND HE GOES DEEP INTO TERRITORY. THEY WILL SPOT THE BALL INSIDE THE 10 YARD LINE. 40 YARDS ON THAT PLAY. 194 YARDS ARE READY FOR DETROIT. AND NINE FOR GREEN BAY. KIRK: THE BACKSIDE OF THE GREEN BAY DEFENSE WERE OUT OF POSITION MAKING IT EASY FOR GOFF. GREAT JOB BY -- GREAT CALL BY BEN JOHNSON AGAIN. AL: WHAT OR WHERE LAMBEAU FIELD IS AND WHAT IT REPRESENTS. DETROIT IS A QUICK COST TO THE OUTSIDE. FIGHTING HIS WAY TO THE FOUR YARD LINE IS SAM LEPORE. -- SAM KIRK: THEY HAD EXTRA BLOCKERS OUT FRONT. COORDINATOR. HE INTERVIEWED FOR A COUPLE HEAD COACHING JOBS. KIRK: I THINK WITH ALL OF THE QUARTERBACKS, HIGH-PROFILE PORTER BOX COMING OUT NEXT YEAR, HE -- QUARTERBACKS COMING OUT NEXT YEAR HE WILL BECOME A HOT NAME. AL: DETROIT RUNNING ITS 23RD PLAY RIGHT HERE. GOFF SPINS AWAY AND FIRES IT OUT OF BOUNDS. A FLAG IS DOWN. THE SECOND ONE TONIGHT. HERE IS ALAN ECK. THE CROWD LIKES IT IF IT IS AGAINST THE LIONS. >> HOLDING. A 10 YARD PENALTY. AL: GREEN BAY WAS GOING TO BE FOURTH AND GOAL IF YOU DECLINE IT. INSTEAD, THEY WILL TAKE THE YARDAGE AND MAKE IT THIRD DOWN AND GOAL. KIRK: I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED. AL: AN INTERESTING CALL. KIRK: LOOK AT GARY, NICE JOB GETTING A PUSH AGAINST TAYLOR. WE TALK SO MUCH ABOUT HUTCHINSON , ANOTHER MICHIGAN MAN IN MARY TAKING HIS PRESENCE FELT. GOOD TO SEE HIS RETURN FROM THE ACL HE HAD IN NINE A YEAR AGO. AL: THIRD DOWN AND GOAL. MONTGOMERY SPLIT ALL THE WAY TO THE LEFT TOP OF THE SCREEN. UNDER PRESSURE. FIRES. INCOMPLETE. MEANT FOR MARVIN JONES. NOW IT IS FOURTH AND GOAL APPEARED A FIELD GOAL IS A CHIP SHOT. 10 YARDS -- 10 YARDS LONGER HAD THEY DECLINED TO THE PENALTY. KIRK: GOOD JOB BY THE PACKERS. I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT GIVE UP ANOTHER TOUCHDOWN BUT THEY STOPPED THEM THERE. AL: 17-3. A TWO POSSESSION LEAD. RILEY PATTERSON BANGS THAT ONE IN WITH EASE. WE ARE STICK WITH THAT ONE. KIRK: I LIKE IT BECAUSE OF THE LONGEVITY OF IT. I JUST CAN'T THINK OF TWO GUYS BEING THE FACES OF A FOR 30 YEARS. AL: HE LOVES TO RUN KICKS OUT OF THE END ZONE. HE DOES SO HERE. ONLY GETS TO THE 22 YARD LINE. >> DURING THE RETURN, HOLDING, NUMBER SIX. KIRK: GREEN BAY BACK INTO THEIR OWN TERRITORY. FOCUSING SO MUCH ON JORDAN LOVE. TO ME, IT' TO ME, IT'S AS MUCH ABOUT THE THEIR TO BEST LINEMAN ON THE LEFT SIDE ARE NOT IN THIS GAME. JOHN RUNYAN IS PLAYING WITH AN ANKLE. THEY HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO GIVE LOVE MORE TIME. AL: PLAY-ACTION. TIPPED. PICK. 26 YARD LINE. JERRY JACOBS, INSIDE THE 10. HE GETS DOWN TO THE SIX YARD TIPPED THAT TIME BY THE LINEBACKER. A LOT OF LIONS YOU CAN HEAR THEM. KIRK: THIS IS A HECK OF A JOB. AND SALOME AND THE LINEBACKERS, WATCH THEM COME DOWN AGAINST THE RUN AND THEN RETREAT. WATCH HOW FAST THEY GET DOWNHILL PLAY-ACTION. RIGHT THERE. HE GETS HIS HAND ON THE FOOTBALL TO ALLOW THE INTERCEPTION TO JACOBS. REALLY GOOD JOB BY THE LEADER OF THE DEFENSE WITH HIS REPEATED, GETTING BACK IN THE THROWING LANE OF JORDAN LOVE. AL: FROM THE SEVEN. FIRST AND GOAL. FINDS THE WHOLE DOES MONTGOMERY. FORWARD TO THE TWO YARD LINE. KIRK: I THOUGHT GREEN BAY GOT TESTED A WEEK AGO. NOW YOU ARE GETTING TESTED THE VERY NEXT WEEK. AL: THEY GO FAST INTO A HUDDLE. TRYING TO KEEP THE SAME PACKER DEFENSE OUT THERE. KEEP IT ON THE GROUND. THROUGH THE MIDDLE. THERE HE GOES AGAIN. MONTGOMERY FOR SIX. SECOND TOUCHDOWN TONIGHT FOR MONTGOMERY AND A BIG COLD FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE WEEK BUILT BY THE GREEN BAY PACKERS. KIRK: LOOK AT THE HOLD RIGHT HERE. LOOK AT THIS CAP. MAKES IT EASY FOR THE OFFENSE TO WORK A DOUBLE-TEAMED THERE AND JUST KICK OUT. IT'S LIKE JUSTIN HOLLAND IS GAPING HOLE FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO RUN THROUGH. HE' HE'S BEEN BUSY TONIGHT. THREE EXTRA POINTS ON THE FIELD GOAL ALREADY. LESS THAN TWO MINUTES INTO THE SECOND. 24-3 LIONS. JACK FOX TO KICK OFF FOR DETROIT. IT WILL BOUNCE THROUGH THE END ZONE. THE WINNER OF THIS GAME, UNDISPUTED POSITION OF FIRST. VIKINGS AND BEARS STILL TRYING TO GET OFF. KIRK: A LONG WAY TO GO. IF YOU ARE A DETROIT LIONS FAN, YOU ARE WATCHING THIS GAME RIGHT NOW, HOW EXCITED ARE YOU? WITH THE WAY THE FINISHED LAST YEAR, THE WAY THEY ARE PLAYING TONIGHT, THE CULTURE CHANGE, THE SPEED, THE ATTITUDE, THE CORNERBACK PLAY, THE OFFENSE OF BEN JONSON. IT'S A LOT TO BE EXCITED ABOUT FOR LIONS FANS. AL: AARON JONES HAS BEEN HURT. UP TO THE 30 YARD LINE. THE CROWD HAD ONE -- THEY HAD ONE TOTAL YARD UNTIL THAT RUN. KIRK: KIND OF A SARCASTIC CHEER BY THE LIMBO FAITHFUL. THEY WANT TO SEE OFFENSE AND GET BACK INTO THE FOOTBALL GAME HERE GET THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO. THEY PROVED THAT LAST WEEK, WHAT THEY CAN DO. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, WE SAW SOME URGENCY AND TEMPO. IT HELPED A YOUNG QUARTERBACK IN JORDAN LOVE EXECUTE MUCH BETTER. AL: SECOND AND 5. NOTHING HAPPENING THERE. GREAT DEFENSIVE. CAM SUTTON COMES UP BEHIND THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. THIRD DOWN AND 7. KIRK: IT STARTS OUT WITH THE DEFENSE. WATCH THE FLOW AND SPEED OF THE WATCH HOW THEY STRING OUT. NOT SURPRISED AT ALL BY THIS OFTEN -- OPTION. THERE IS NOWHERE TO GO AFTER THIS PITCH. THAT' THAT'S DISCIPLINED DEFENSE FOR AARON GLENN, THE DEFENSIVE GRENADA. -- COURT NADER. AL: THE PACKERS CAN'T GET OUT OF THE RUNWAY. THIRD AND 7. GLENN THERE ON THE SIDELINE. LOVE HANGING IN. THAT'S BY -- BAD EITHER WAY. BRIAN BRANCH IS THERE. YOU DON'T HEAR A LOT OF BOOS IN LAMBEAU. KIRK: HUTCHERSON, SECOND YEAR. SAW A SACK ALREADY EARLIER JUST THE WAY HE PLAYS, THE ENERGY WHICH HE PLAYS WITH. THE ROOKIE OUT OF ALABAMA BRIAN BRANCH, A TYRANN MATHIEU TYPE OF PLAYER THAT TIME WITH HIS VERSATILITY. GREAT PLAY. AL: WE LYNN'S PICK. 20 YARD LINE. AVOIDS THE TACKLE. AL: LIONS HAVE DRAFTED WELL. TAKE A LOOK AT THAT FOR SOME. ALL MAKING THEIR PRESENCE KNOWN AT THIS POINT OF THE SEASON. KIRK: THAT'S EASY TO SAY WHEN A LOT OF THESE GUYS WERE DRAFTED. THERE WAS A LOT OF QUESTION MARKS. PEOPLE WONDERING IF THEY WERE REACHING. THEY PUT THEIR MINDS TOGETHER WITH THE ENTIRE STAFF AND CAME UP WITH FOUR GUYS THAT ARE IMPACT PLAYERS AND MAKING A DIFFERENCE ON THE TEAM. AL: THAT THROW IS COMPLETE. PICKING UP ENOUGH FOR THE FIRST DOWN AS HE DANGLES TO 11 YARD GAIN. KIRK: WHEN YOU TALK TO HIM ABOUT WHAT THEY LOOK FOR, IT'S NOT TALENT. HOW YOU CHANGE THE CULTURE. EVERYONE OF THEM TALKED ABOUT, WE ARE LOOKING FOR GUYS THAT LOVE FOOTBALL, HAVE A CHIP ON THEIR SHOULDER, WANT TO PRACTICE, WANT TO WORK AT GETTING BETTER. IF YOU LOOK AT EVERY ONE OF THOSE PLAYERS, THEY ALL HAVE THAT IN COMMON. AL: GOING WITH THE FULLBACK THIS TIME. THEY GIVE IT TO MONTGOMERY. THE FLAG IS DOWN. TALKING ABOUT THAT MONTGOMERY TRADE. TONY JACKSON IS THE GUARD. THEY PICKED UP DRAFT PICKS AND THEY MADE THE MOST OF THOSE PICKS. KIRK: ABSOLUTELY. YOU ARE BRINGING IN GUYS THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING AND MAKING PLAYS. IT TAKES TIME TO DO WITH THE RIGHT WAY. YOU HAVE TO DO IT THROUGH THE DRAFT. YOU CAN'T DO IT FOR A QUICK FIX. THEY BUILT THIS THING FROM THE GROUND UP AT THEY' GROUND UP AT THEY'VE DONE IT THE LOOK AT THEIR ROSTER. A LOT OF THESE GUYS ARE STILL VERY YOUNG. AL: FIRST AND 20 NOW. LOW SNAP. HANDLES IT CLEANLY. MONTGOMERY TAKING IT FOR A SHORT GAIN. KAYLEE: SAM LAPORTA AND JARED GOFF SAY THEY STRUCK IT. HE ADMITTED, IT WAS OVERWHELMING. THE TENDENCY TO OVER ANALYZE. TELLING HIM EXACTLY WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR. IT MAKES IT SIMPLE FOR HIM TO GO OUT AND EXECUTE. AL: CAREER OFF TO A GREAT START. 18. AL: AND A WHISTLE. KIRK: HE HASN'T BEEN PLAYING FOOTBALL MUCH LATELY. THE CROWD MAY AFFECT HIM ON THE LEFT SIDE. AL: THIRD DOWN AND 23 NOW. LIONS HAVE 11 FIRST DOWNS. THIRD AND 23. OVER THE MIDDLE. WELL SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN. THE LIONS WILL PUNT. FIRST DETROIT PUNT OF THE GAME. KIRK: SO MUCH WAS MADE ABOUT JORDAN LOVE LAST WEEK. AL: THE OTHER SAVING -- SEVEN CAME ON A RUN BACK. JACK FOX, WHO NORMALLY BOOMS IN THIS ONE SHORTER THAN NORMAL FOR HIM, TAKES A LITTLE BOUNCE FOR HIM. IT'S JUGGLED. CAN THE PACKERS SAVE IT OR NOT? IT'S A SCRAMBLE INSIDE THE EIGHT THEY ARE ABLE TO RECOVER IT. JADEN READ COULDN'T HANDLE IT. HERE IT IS AGAIN. TRIED TO PICK IT UP ONTO HOPS. KIRK: OH BOY. AL: THEY GOT AWAY WITH IT. KIRK: VERY FORTUNATE. THERE'S A ROOKIE BACK THERE TRYING TO MAKE THE PLAY AND THEN HE STARTS TO HURRY. VERY FORTUNATE. LOOK LIKE KEY ENTREE THOMAS ENDED UP GETTING ON TOP OF THE SOMEHOW THE BALL CAME BACK TO AL: THAT COULD HAVE BEEN A GILL SHOT -- KILL SHOT. THREE POSSESSION LEAD. HERE'S GREEN BAY. CAN THEY GET SOMETHING GOING NO FIRST DOWN. FOR TOTAL YARDS. AJAY DYLAN IS THE BACKUP. CHASED FROM THE END ZONE. LOVE, LEFT-HANDED, THROWS IT TO AVOID THE SAFETY GET LOOSE -- LUKE MUSGRAVE MAKES IT. ALMOST PICKED UP TWO POINTS. KIRK: I SAW DRAKE MAY LAST WEEK WHO WILL BE ONE OF THE FIRST PICKS NEXT YEAR IN THE DRAFT, THROWING A LEFT-HANDED TOUCHDOWN IS A RIGHT-HANDER. NOW JORDAN LOVE. HUTCHERSON IS RELENTLESS. JUST GETS RID OF IT WITH THE LEFT-HAND. IT'S ALL HE COULD DO. AL: THAT WOULD BE THE WORST FEELING IN THE WORLD. THE QUARTERBACK. FLIP IT AWAY. SECOND AND9. TO THE OUTSIDE. THAT'S GOOD FOR ABOUT A FOUR YARD SIDE. KIRK: TALK ABOUT A PLAY BEING SYMBOLIC OF A FIRST HALF THAT COULDN'T HAVE GONE ANY WORSE FOR MATT LAFLEUR AND THE PACKERS OFFENSE. IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING TO GET SACKED FOR SAFETY. HUTCHERSON IS A RELENTLESS PASS RUSHER. SOMEHOW, HE JUST GETS RID OF THE BALL. AL: LOVE, THREE OUT OF NINE. 15 YARDS. THEY SPREAD IT OUT HERE. DYLAN BACK INTO THE BACKFIELD. THREE RECEIVERS TO THE RIGHT. WHO JUMPED FIRST? KIRK: THE REACTION BY WALKER AFTER THE MOVEMENT BY CHARLES HARRIS. >> FIVE YARD PENALTY. AL: THEY WILL TAKE A FIRST DOWN ANYWAY THEY CAN GET IT. THE CROWD ERECTS. KIRK: THEY'VE BEEN BACK DEEP IN THEIR OWN TERRITORY THE LAST FEW POSSESSIONS. THE 10 AND THEN THE EIGHT. THERE'S THE REACTION AND THE MOVEMENT BY HARRIS. LIKE YOU SAID, WHATEVER IT TAKES. AL: FROM THE 19. DYLAN STOPPED IN HIS TRACKS. ALINA MCNEIL, NUMBER 54. KIRK: HE DROPPED SOME WEIGHT BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BE A LOT QUICKER. SEE THIS MOVEMENT. WATCH THE RIGHT GUARD PULLING. 85. DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE THE BLOCK BECAUSE OF SUDDEN AND QUICK MCNEIL GETS OFF THE BALL. THAT MAY -- THAT COMMITMENT TO LOSING WEIGHT, MORE ABOUT BEING A PASS RUSHER. WHAT A DIFFERENCE HE IS, GETTING CRITICAL AND MAKING A GREAT PLAY AGAINST THE RUNNER. AL: CRUSHING. DOWN HE GOES AT THE SEVEN. ALINA MCNEIL AGAIN. BACK TO BACK BIG PLACE FOR HIM. THIRD AND 22. KIRK: ROYCE NEWMAN WAS IN THERE FOR JENKINS. HE DROPPED WEIGHT TO BECOME A BETTER PASS RUNNER. MADE A GREAT PLAY AGAINST COMES BACK THE VERY NEXT PLAY, FIGHTS THROUGH NEWMAN, ENDS UP WORKING THROUGH THE LEFT TACKLE COMES UP WITH A BIG SACK. AL: THAT GETS ADDED TO THE TOTAL. THE PACKERS HAVE MINUS ONE YARD. MINUS ONE YARD. THIRD AND 21. LOVE PRESSURED AGAIN TO THE OUTSIDE. THEY NEEDED TO MUCH. DOBBS MAKES THE CATCH. PICKED UP A BUNCH YEAR. KIRK: THIS IS A DEFENSE FROM DETROIT THAT LAST YEAR WAS DEAD LAST IN TOTAL DEFENSE. PASS DEFENSE WAS 30TH. SCORING DEFENSE WAS 28TH. THEY' THEY'VE MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS. THEY FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE. THEY ARE PLAYING A LITTLE BIT SOFTER. TONIGHT, THEY ARE DOMINATING THE AL: THIS IS HIS FOURTH PUNT OF THE NIGHT. 5.5 TO GO TO THE HALF. 24-3 DETROIT. THEIR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION PICTURES. OR SOMETHING SIMILAR. 24 YARD LINE. WE WERE TALKING TOOK OFF THE OTHER DAY. HE SAID, PEOPLE LOOK AT DAN CAMPBELL. HE STARTS OUT, I WILL BITE YOUR MEAN -- KNEECAPS OFF. THEY THINK HE'S A MEATHEAD. HE'S ANYTHING BUT. KIRK: HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH KNOWLEDGE HE HAS. OFFENSE, DEFENSE, SPECIAL TEAMS. HE WAS AROUND SEAN PAYTON FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS IN NEW ORLEANS. HE TALKED ABOUT HOW SEAN PAYTON IS HIS MENTOR. TAUGHT HIM EVERYTHING ABOUT BECOMING A HEAD COACH. HE HAS ADDED HIS OWN STYLE TO THAT. AL: SECOND AND 6. JUST A LITTLE BIT SHORT. WALKER MADE THE TACKLE. KIRK: ALL WEEK, WE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF PLAYERS ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY REALLY LOVE HAVING FORMER PLAYERS AS POSITION COACHES AND COURT MATERS AND HOW THEY CAN RELATE SO WELL TO WHAT THESE PLAYERS ON THIS ROSTER ARE FACING AND GOING THROUGH. IT IS SPRINKLED ALL THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STAFF. AL: THIRD AND YARD. MONTGOMERY GOT IT. A FEW MORE. COLLINS MAKES THE STOP FOR THE KIRK: FORGET ABOUT TONIGHT. I'M TALKING THIS YEAR. THE REASON THEY ARE REAL IS BECAUSE THE OFFENSE OF LINE. THE ADDITION OF DAVID MCCUMBER HE AND JAMIR GIBSON AT BACKFIELD TO GO ALONG WITH GOFF AND WHAT HE HAS TO WORK WITH ON THE THIS IS A REAL TEAM. WE GET EXCITED ABOUT PHILADELPHIA AND SAN FRANCISCO AND OTHER TEAMS IN THE NFC. BUT PEOPLE HAVE TO START PAYING ATTENTION TO DETROIT. AL: LOW. HE GOT HIS HAND ON IT. THEY ARE GOING TO SPOT THE BALL. BACK OF THE LINE OF THE LINE OF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE THOUSAND YARD RUSHER D'ANDRE SWIFT WHO WE SAW IN LEAGUE TWO OF THE PHILADELPHIA. THEY BREAK UP THAT TEAM AND THEY GET THESE GUYS. SECOND AND 10. GOFF FIRES. OVER THE MIDDLE SEAT. THIRD AND 10. KIRK: THIS IS A HECK OF A THROW HE GETS PRESSURED ON HIS LEFT AGAIN. GARY IS A FORCE THAT DECKER IS TRYING TO DEAL WITH AT LEFT TACKLE. HE'S ABLE TO GET THE BALL OUT AND GIVES THE ROOKIE TIGHT END A GREAT CHANCE. LOOK AT THAT. HE IS HIT AS HE THROWS AT FOOTBALL AND STILL PUT IT ON A LINE ACCURATELY. HIS EYES STARTED TO LOOK AT MCDUFFIE THERE, THE LINEBACKER CLOSING IN ON HIM. AL: GOT TO HIM LATE. HAD THREE SACKS LAST WEEK. CAME BACK FROM AN ACL MIDYEAR LAST YEAR. THAT'S CAUGHT. ADVANCING HIS WAY FOR A FIRST DOWN AND MOORE. BROWN BROKE AWAY FROM DARNELL SAVAGE AND THAT NETS IN THE FIRST DOWN ON THE GAIN OF 14. KIRK: THEY BROUGHT THE LINEBACKER THIS TIME. THEY SHOWED PRESSURE. ENDED UP BRINGING WILSON. ANYTIME YOU CAN GET SAME BROWN MATCHED UP UNDERNEATH, IT'S TIME THAT HE SENSED THE BLITZ. WALKER MOVED TO THE OUTSIDE. THE THROW WENT BACK TO THE INSIDE AND SAME BROWN MAKES A LOT OF HIS LIVING THERE. AL: WIDE. AVOIDS THAT SACK. MYERS REACHING UP. CALLING IT IN. OH MAN. WALKER COVERS. GOFF DOES THE ESCAPE JOB. GOES AGAINST THE GRAIN. GETS HIS MAN. FIRST OUT. KIRK: GOFF IS NOT A DUAL THREAT GUY BUT HE'S ATHLETIC ENOUGH TO GET AWAY FROM THIS AND KEEP HIS EYES DOWNFIELD. THE TIGHT END WORKS TO FIND THAT OPENING. GOOD JOB OF HELPING THE WHERE CAN I GET OPEN? GETS AWAY FROM THE LINEBACKER GREAT RECOGNITION AGAIN. AL: TWO-MINUTE WARNING UPCOMING. WE WARNED YOU. TWO MINUTES LEFT IN THE HALF. 24-3. TWO MINUTES TO HALF DOWN -- HALFTIME. FIRST DOWN HERE. TO THE MIDDLE. ANOTHER BIG RUN. DAVID MONTGOMERY. 14 TO THE 19 HE GOES. KIRK: IT'S BAD ENOUGH YOU ARE DOWN 24-3. YOU HAVE NEGATIVE TWO YARDS STILL. AL: THEY PICKED UP SOME. KIRK: OBVIOUSLY NOT A GREAT NIGHT. THEY ARE BODY BLOWING YOU. EVEN MORE CHALLENGING EMOTIONALLY WHEN YOU GET HIT AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. AL: THEY HAVE'S CONKING NOW. SECOND AND SEVEN -- SECOND AND 7. MONTGOMERY IS TACKLED THERE. THIRD DOWN. KIRK: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR NEXGEN STATS POWERED BY AWS. IT'S THE LION'S DEFENSE. YOU THINK THEY'VE BEEN BLITZING ALL NIGHT BUT THEY ARE NOT. WHY SHOULD HE? 46%. HUTCHERSON HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE GETTING INTO THAT MCNEIL HAS BEEN IN THE EVERYONE OF THE OFFENSIVE LINEMAN HAS STRUGGLED. YOU THINK IT WOULD BE COMING FROM THE LEFT SIDE BUT IT'S NOT. THE DEFENSIVE PRESSURE AND THE WAY THAT HE'S BEEN ABLE TO DESIGN THE PLAN, THEY'VE ATTACKED FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE , HAVING THEIR WAY OF THINGS. AL: IT'S INTERESTING. GREEN BAY WILL CALL A TIMEOUT THEY ARE IN A NO MAN'S LAND. THEY WANT TO GET OFF THE FIELD AND BACK INTO THE LOCKER ROOM. YOU ARE PLAYING WITH FIRE HERE. LETTING THEM HAVE THE EXTRA THIRD AND 6. FALLING DOWN THAT TIME. DROPPING TO HIS KNEES. THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE. KIRK: THAT ONE GUY WHO IS COMPETING HIS TAIL OFF IS 52. HE'S BEEN RELENTLESS IN HIS OWN RIGHT, ESPECIALLY ON THE THIRD DOWN GOING UP AGAINST DECKER AND WINNING THE BATTLE, GETTING INTO THE BACKFIELD. GETTING INTO GOFF'S FACE. AL: RILEY PATTERSON CAME OVER IN A PLAYED -- TRADE WITH THE JAGUARS. THE KICK IS GOOD. JUST INSIDE THE LEFT UPRIGHT. WE CAN TELL YOU, THE FALCONS AND JAGUARS ARE GOING TO BE TRANSFORMING INTO THE WORLD OF PIXAR' PIXAR'S TOE STORY. DON'T MISS SUNDAY AT 9:30 A.M. EASTERN ON ESPN PLUS. WHAT IF YOU GOT? KAYLEE: THE PACKERS HAVE -- NEED ALL THE HELP THEY CAN GET. WE WATCH THE TIGHT END WALK OFF HE'S BEING EVALUATED UNDER CONCUSSION PROTOCOL. AL: GOOD. THEY LIKE HIM A LOT. OREGON STATE OFF TO A GOOD START. HE'S BACK, BEING CHECKED OUT. KIRK: HE HAS TO COME UP WITH A WAY TO HELP THE OFFENSIVE LINE. YOU CAN MOVE THE LAUNCH POINT, MOVE THE POCKET AROUND, GET THEM AWAY FROM THE PRESSURE, THE SCREAMS. ANYTHING TO GET JORDAN LOVE INTO SOME KIND OF RHYTHM. AL: YOU KNOW, HIS RECEIVERS ARE SO YOUNG. THEY ARE EITHER ROOKIES OR SECOND-YEAR GUYS. IT'S A KITTY COOLER. THAT WIDE ROLE WAS LIKE ROBBERY. KIRK: THEY'VE BEEN WORKING WITHOUT WANTS IN LAST COUPLE GAMES. HE'S BACK WITHOUT AARON JONES. WE THOUGHT, THEY HAVE SOME MORE EXPLOSIVE PAY MAKERS. THEY CAN'T GET A PLAY CALLED BECAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING UP FRONT. AL: EXACTLY. TOO MUCH PRESSURE. KIRK: HUTCHERSON ON THE INSIDE. AL: BAD TIME THEY STOP THEM. SECOND DOWN AND 5. A COUPLE OF TIMEOUTS. NOT USING THEM HERE. LOOK OUT. OUT OF TROUBLE FOR THE MOMENT. AND THEN YOU'VE GOT JOHN KRASINSKI BURYING HIM AS HE THROWS IT AWAY. KIRK: HE SAYS, LET ME GET IN ON THE ACT. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT MCNEIL. THEY MOVE HUTCHERSON TO THE INSIDE THERE OVER THE LAST -- LEFT GUARD. IT'S THE OTHER SIDE, A GOOD EFFORT. FINISHING ON THAT PLAY. WE ASKED IF HUTCHERSON LIKES BEING MOVED TO THE INSIDE. HE SAID AT FIRST, I WASN'T REALLY EXCITED ABOUT BEING ASKED TO MOVE IN THERE. IF IT HELPS THE TEAM, I' IF IT HELPS THE TEAM, I'M STARTING TO UNDERSTAND IT. HE HAS GOOD LATERAL QUICKNESS. IT SUBMITS -- IT'S A MISMATCH FOR HIM AGAINST THE OFFENSIVE GUARD. AL: PACKER FANS HAVEN'T WITNESSED MANY FIRST HALF LIKE THIS. THINK ABOUT THIS. THE LIONS ARE TRYING TO WIN GAMES INTO OF THE TOUGH PLACES IN THE LEAGUE. KIRK: I THINK THAT GAME AGAINST THE CHIEF SCOTT THE ENTIRE LEAKS ATTENTION. THE WAY THE GAME IS PLAYED, HOW ATHLETIC THEY LOOK. THEN YOU FOLLOW IT UP WITH A GAME LIKE THIS IN LAMBEAU AT THIS STAGE. AL: PEOPLE MAY DETROIT THE IT TEAM, LOOKING OUT FOR THESE GUYS. DETROIT WILL TAKE A TIMEOUT THIS WAS A HOT TEAM AT THE END OF LAST YEAR. CAMPBELL STARTED HIS CAREER AT 19-1. ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEY GET HOT PURE GET TRYING TO MAKE IT THREE OUT OF FOUR THIS YEAR. YOU ARE RIGHT. KIRK: AGAIN, YOU GET THE PICK SIX. SOME OF THESE YOUNGER PLAYERS STARTING TO MAKE PLAYS. THEY ARE NOT JUST WINNING THE GAME. THEY LOOK ATHLETIC. THEY LOOK LIKE THEY ARE THE AGGRESSOR. HOW THEY RESPONDED TO THAT LOSS, THEY CAME BACK LAST WEEK AGAINST ATLANTA, DOMINATING THE GAME. HERE THEY ARE AGAIN. UP 27-3 AT THE HALF. AL: ATHLETIC AND VERY PHYSICAL. THAT IS WHATEVER THAT IS. THERE'S THE FLAG. DON JACOBS COVERING ON THE PLAY. THREE SECONDS. >> PASS INTERFERENCE. NUMBER 23. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. AL: DOBBS HAD THAT BIG CATCH LAST WEEK. ENDED UP BEING A GAME-WINNING TOUCHDOWN. LOOK HOW TIGHT THAT COVERAGES. I CAN SEE WHAT JACOBS IS SAYING. HE WAS TIGHT ON HIS COVERAGE MAYBE THE VERY END OF THAT ROUTE HE'S FRUSTRATED. HE THOUGHT HE WAS IN HIS POCKET. AL: NOTHING TO DO HERE BUT A HAIL MARY, ASSUMING HE HAS MORE THAN 2.5 SECONDS. FINAL PLAY OF THE HALF, BARRING THE DEFENSIVE FOUL. FORGET ABOUT IT. HE'S GOING TO GET SACKED. THAT WILL TAKE MORE YARDAGE OFF THE TOTAL. OH BOY. THE SOUND YOU DON'T HEAR HERE. KIRK: IT' KIRK: IT'S HARD TO THROW A HAIL MARY WHEN YOU NEED A LITTLE BIT OF TIME AND HARRIS GOES RIGHT BY HUTCHERSON, THE ENERGY HE BRINGS TO THE DEFENSE. AL: 27-3 DETROIT AT THE BREAK. STATE FARM HALFTIME SHOW, COMING RIGHT UP. IN FOUR GAMES IN HISTORY. KIRK: INCREDIBLE AFTER THEIR FIRST TWO WEEKS HAD THE ONE SACK AND OUT -- ANSWERED A LOT OF QUESTIONS FROM THEIR MEDIA. WHY CAN'T YOU COME UP WITH THE SACK? AL: NIXON. INTO THE END ZONE. THE FLAG IS THROWN. A GOOD RUNBACK. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT NORMALLY MEANS. ALL THE LINES ARE POINTING IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION. HOBBLES OFF. NUMBER 89. 10 YARD PENALTY. AL: MOMENTS AGO, KAYLEE TALKED TO MATT LAFLEUR. KAYLEE: WHAT ADJUSTMENTS DO YOU NEED TO PUT YOUR LOVE? >> WE HAVE TO BLOCK BETTER. THEY WON THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BALL. IT'S VERY HUMBLING AND EMBARRASSING. KAYLEE: WHAT DID YOU TELL YOUR TEAM AT THE HALF? >> WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO LOOK EACH OTHER INTO THE EYE AND GIVE IT UP FOR ONE ANOTHER THIS WHOLE SECOND HALF. I WANT TO SEE THE TEAM FIGHT. AL: NOT MUCH MORE NEED BE SAID. FROM THE 14 YARD LINE. PRESSURE ON. THE PASS IS CAUGHT AND TAKEN DOWN TO THE 20 YARD LINE. THERE'S TUCKER CRAFT. NUMBER TWO TIGHT END. KIRK: THREE ROOKIE TIGHT ENDS. YOU CAN FEEL THAT ENERGY TO GET YOU CAN'T BLAME MATT LEFLORE EMBARRASSED AND FRUSTRATED, TRYING TO COME UP WITH ANSWERS. WE TALKED ABOUT, WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU ARE LOSING THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AS BADLY ON OFFENSE? ONE OF THE THINGS RIGHT THERE, MOVING THE LAUNCH POINT. MOVING THE POCKET AROUND. TRYING TO GIVE YOUR QUARTERBACK A CHANCE TO GET AWAY FROM THE PRESSURE. AL: ON THE GROUND. COMES A YARD SHINE. AARON JONES WORKING HIS WAY BACK FROM A HAMSTRING INJURY. NEVER A GOOD SIGN WHEN A COACH REFERS TO, IT'S EMBARRASSING. SEAN PAYTON MAY HAVE SAID THAT LAST WEEK IN MIAMI. KIRK: THAT WAS REALLY A ROUGH AFTERNOON FOR DENVER. THIS FIRST HALF, WE WERE ALL TALKING AT HALFTIME, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THIS CROWD DEALT WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS? EVER? PRE-BRETT FAVRE? AL: MAYBE IN THE LATE 80'S. THIRD AND 1. THAT'S GOING TO BE CAUGHT FOR A DOBBS. GREEN BAY'S FOURTH FIRST DOWN. CREATES AN UPROARIOUS SITUATION IN THE STANDS. KAYLEE: DAN CAMPBELL TOLD ME HIS BIGGEST CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS THAT HIS TEAM WON'T COME OUT WITH THE SAME ENERGY THAT GOT THEM THIS 24 POINT LEAD. HE TOLD ME, I SAW THAT PACKERS GAME LAST WEEK, I SAW THEM COME BACK, WE CAN'T LET THEM DO THAT RIGHT NOW. HE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE ANY PENALTIES FROM HIS TEAM. HE WANTS TO SEE MORE DISCIPLINE. AL: THAT'S CAUGHT WIDE OPEN. LAUNCHING. FINALLY A BIG PLAY FROM THE 25 YARDS. KIRK: THEY ARE PLAYING WITH TWO SAFETIES DEEP. YOU SEE MOVEMENT HERE AND HERE. DOBBS DOES A GOOD JOB OF CLEARING IT OUT, OPENING UP A NICE THROWING LANE THERE. YOU SAW THE PRESSURE BY MCNEIL. GOOD JOB OF WAITING UNTIL THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT UNTIL HE GOT RID OF THE FOOTBALL. CLEARED OVER THE MIDDLE THERE. NICE GAME. AL: MOTION HERE. NOTHING. FLAG THROWN. TO JONES. HE MADE THE CATCH. THAT WOULD'VE BEEN A TWO YARD >> HANDS TO THE FACE. NUMBER 97. AL: THERE'S HUTCHERSON. KIRK: RIGHT NEAR THE END OF HIS MOVE FOR THE CORNERBACK. HE GOT HIS HANDS INTO THE FACE OF SACK TOM. REMEMBER, HE'S A GUY THAT'S GOING TO GO BEYOND THE WHISTLE. HE WAS REALLY CLOSE. I DON'T THINK HE CARED FOR THAT AT ALL. IT LOOKED LIKE HE GOT THE TOP OF THE SHOULDER PAD. THE REFEREE SAW IT AND THROUGH THE FLAG -- THREW THE FLAG. AL: HE GOES INTO THE PATTERN. THE PAST IS THROWN OUT OF BOUNDS -- PASS IS THROWN OUT OF BOUNDS. DOBBS THE INTENDED RECEIVER. KIRK: HE IS TRYING TO KEEP HIS SAFETY IS BACK. HE DOES NOT WANT TO GIVE UP THE HOMERUN. HAVE A SAFETIES BACK THERE AND MAKE GREEN BAY HAVE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL OR MAKE SHORT OR INTERMEDIATE THROWS. AL: HE PLAYED FOR BILL BELICHICK AND BILL PARCELLS. HE HAS NOT HIT THE HOMERUN YET. HE TOOK SOME PEOPLE ON THE SIDELINE WITH HIM. A FLAG DOWN. WOULD'VE BEEN A NINE YEARD GAIN. BRANCH NEEDS ATTENTION. >> PERSONAL FOUL, UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS. KIRK: HE USES HIS HELMET. HE LOWERS HIS HELMET, IS THE CALL. HE IS IN BOUNDS. CAN YOU BRING IN ON THIS? >> THAT IS THE ONLY THING THEY CAN CALL IS USE OF THE HELMET. LOWERING HIS HELMET. IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS LEAVING WITH HIS SHOULDER. THE HELMET CONTACT WAS INCIDENTAL. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS A FOUL. AL: THEY CALLED IT ANYWAY. BRANCH IS DOWN. STILL DOWN. HERE IS HOW HE GOT HURT. KIRK: AS HE SIMULTANEOUSLY GETS HIT. I DON'T KNOW IF HE STEPPED ON HIS FOOT. HE IMMEDIATELY WENT DOWN. IF YOU ARE LIONS FANS, YOU'RE HOLDING YOUR BREATH. THIS ROOKIE HAS BEEN A GREAT PICKUP FOR DETROIT. SO VERSATILE AND SO TOUGH. HE TOOK IT ALL THE WAY IN. NOT A GOOD SIGN AS HE COMES HOBBLING OFF THE FIELD. SECOND ROUND PICK OUT OF KIRK: LET' KIRK: LET'S SEE IF ANYTHING HAPPENS BEFORE THE CONTACT. YOU SEE HIM REACHING DOWN TO THAT RIGHT LEG. AL: THE ROOKIE GOES TO THE BENCH. PENALTIES HAVE HELPED AS WELL. THE THROW IS JUGGLED AND CAUGHT BUT NOTHING DOING THERE. KIRK: CHANGING HIS ARM ANGLE TO GET AROUND THE PRESSURE. DETROIT ALREADY, JOHNSON HAS BEEN OUT. JOSEPH IS INACTIVE. NOW BRANCH IS OUT. WILL HARRIS ASKED TO MOVE IN AND PLAY. AL: THEY CAME RIGHT AT HIM. JONES WILL GO NOWHERE AND PAY THE PRICE. KIRK: HE IS HAVING A ROUGH NIGHT AGAINST THIS PAST CRUSH. -- RUSH. USUALLY HE IS GETTING IN THERE THE ONLY THING WALKER COULD DO IS GRAB ONTO HIM. AL: HE HAS MISSED SO MANY GAMES THROUGHOUT THE LAST COUPLE OF SEASONS. ON INJURED RESERVE TONIGHT. PRESSURE, GETS IT AWAY. TO THE SIXTY TO THE SIXTEEN YARD LINE. THERE GOES BRANCH. THAT IS A BAD SITE. TO THE LOCKER ROOM HE GOES. KIRK: YOU HATE TO SEE THAT. HOPEFULLY HE WILL BE OK. THEY WILL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT WITH AN X-RAY. THEY HAVE A NICE DRIVE. THEY HAVE TO CONVERT. AL: FORGET A FIELD GOAL. THEY NEED TO SEVEN. CAN THEY GET IT? LOVE FIRES, CAUGHT BY DOBBS TO MAKE IT FIRST AND GOAL. KIRK: BROUGHT THE PRESSURE. A GOOD JOB OF SITTING IN THEIR. MAKING A HECK OF A THROW. PUTTING THE SAFETY IN A TOUGH SPOT. WATCH HIM JUMP THE ROUTE UNDERNEATH. HE HAS A GREAT OPENING RIGHT BEHIND TO MAKE THE THROW. AL: 15 YARDS. SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. KIRK: GOOD DRIVE HERE. THE FIRST HALF, 20 YARDS. THIS DRIVE, 85 YARDS. AL: 11 PLAYS. STARTED WITH A PENALTY. NOW YOU HAVE AN INJURED LION. KIRK: WE HAVE HAD BRANCH GO DOWN, NOW BARNES. AL: BARNES ABLE TO WALK OFF UNDER HIS OWN POWER. SECOND AND GOAL. 8:30 TO GO IN THE THIRD. TRYING TO CULMINATE WHAT WOULD BE AN 86 YARD DRIVE. IN THE PISTOL. NOW SIDE-BY-SIDE. PLAY FAKE, PASS, WIDE-OPEN, TOUCHDOWN WATSON. 27-9. THEY WILL KEEP THE OFFENSE OUT THERE TO MAKE IT A TWO POSSESSION GAME. MAKE IT 27-11. KIRK: A LITTLE MISCOMMUNICATION THERE FROM THE FOUR -- DETROIT DEFENDERS. MADE IT PRETTY EASY. AL: TWO POINT CONVERSION. THEY CONVERTED ONE LAST WEEK. THAT PASS CAUGHT IN THE BACK OF THEY WERE DOWN HUGE OPENING NIGHT BACK IN 2018. KIRK: THEY ARE BELIEVING. NOW IT IS UP TO THE DEFENSE. NOBODY THERE. YOU CAN SEE WALKER COMPLETELY FOOLED. HE KIND OF GOT CAUGHT UP WITH THE QUARTERBACK ROLLING THAT WAY. A GOOD CALL BY MATT LAFLEUR. YOU KNOW HE CHALLENGED THEM JUST BASED ON THAT. THEY WERE FRUSTRATED AND EMBARRASSED. HE WANTS TO SEE WHO WANTS TO FIGHT IN THE SECOND HALF. KAYLEE: JUST AFTER WE SAW HIM CARTED OFF THE FIELD, HE WAS TAKEN STRAIGHT TO THE X-RAY ROOM. THERE WILL -- THE LIONS TOLD US HE IS QUESTIONABLE TO RETURN. THE PACKERS ARE RULING OUT THERE TIGHT END AFTER HE WAS EVALUATED IN CONCUSSION PROTOCOL. AL: A GUY GOES OFF ON A CART. I DID THE OPENING GAME HERE. THE BEARS LED 20-0. AARON RODGERS TAKE IT OUT ON A CART. SECOND HALF, BACK HE COMES. THREE TOUCHDOWN PASSES. THEY WIN THE GAME. OURTH RATING. KIRK: HE MADE A MISTAKE EARLY WITH THAT INTERCEPTION. SINCE THEN HE HAS PRETTY MUCH BEEN IN COMMAND. HE HAS BEEN EIGHT BENEFICIARY OF REALLY GOOD OFFENSIVE LINE PLAY. AL: FROM THE 27. THEY GO TO THE GROUND GAME. STEAM CARRIES FOR DAVID. KIRK: THE OFFENSE ANSWER THE CHALLENGE FOR GREENLIGHT -- GREEN BAY. LET' LET'S SEE HOW THE DEFENSE CAN RESPOND. THEY WILL HAVE TO TAKE SOME CHANCES. GET SOME SAFETIES DOWN AGAINST THIS RUNNING GAME. BE CAREFUL AGAINST A AL: PRESSURE FROM THE OUTSIDE. PASS CAUGHT. BUT THE TACKLING IS RIGHT THERE. TAKING GIVES DOWN -- GIBBS DOWN. THE CROWD IN A FRENZY. THIRD DOWN AND 12. GOFF FIRES, CAUGHT. BEAUTIFUL TACKLE. A QUICK THREE AND OUT. BUTLER IS RIGHT THERE TO TAKE SAINT BROWN TO THE GROUND. LOVE PUTS THE HELMET ON AND HE IS READY TO COME BACK FOR THE NEXT DRIVE. KIRK: THE DEFENSE DOES THEIR JOB, GETS A THREE AND OUT. DO NOT THINK THESE GREEN BAY PACKERS ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT WHAT THEY DID IN THE FOURTH ORDER LAST WEEK COMING BACK FROM 17. AL: A FAIR CATCH MADE. 30 YARD LINE. 6:16 TO GO IN THE THIRD. THE MIRACLE OF MODERN MEDICINE, NOW HE IS BACK OUT ON THE SIDELINE. THEY ARE TAPING HIM UP. WHO KNOWS? GREEN BAY FROM THE 30 YARD LINE. THAT GOES OUT OF BOUNDS. WALKER CAME FLYING IN. BACKWARD PASS. KIRK: DEFINITELY A BACKWARDS PASS. TRYING TO THROW IT TO DOBBS BUT DETROIT ALL OVER THAT. YOU WONDER IF HE IS THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF DOBBS THROWING IT BACK. LOVE WAS LUCKY TO GET THE BALL OFF BECAUSE OF WALKER IN HIS FACE. AL: THEY TRIED THAT TRICK PLAY LAST WEEK AND IT DID NOT WORK. A LOSS OF ELEVEN YARDS. HERE HE COMES. THE PASS INCOMPLETE. WALKER COVERING. KAYLEE: AS YOU SAW, BRANCHES OUT HERE ON THE TRAINING TABLE. THEY PUT AN ADHESIVE HEATING PAD RIGHT ON THE ANKLE AND GAVE HIM A SOLID TAPE JOB. HE DOES NOT LOOK TO BE IN ANY PAIN. WHEN HE CAME OUT OF THE TUNNEL, HE WAS WALKING ON HIS OWN ACCORD. HE GOT UP TO A SLOW JOG. LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO SUPPORT AL: THIRD AND 21. DEEP DROP, PASS ALONG THE OFFICIALS CHECKING WITH EACH OTHER. ATTACHED IS GOOD -- CATCH IS GOOD. IT WILL BE FOURTH AND 6. THEY NEEDED 21 GOT 15. KIRK: DOING HIS BEST MYLES GARRETT IMPRESSION. ONE OF THE BETTER JOBS THIS OFFENSIVE LINE HAS DONE ALL NIGHT ON A THIRD DOWN. TOO MANY YARDS TO MAKE OF AFTER THE LOSS. AL: THAT BACKWARD PASS KILLED THE FIFTH PUNT OF THE NIGHT. FIELDED AT THE 15 YARD LINE. A COUPLE OF THEM, IN FACT, ON EITHER SIDE OF THE FIELD. 4:53 LEFT IN THE THIRD. KIRK: I THINK EVERYONE IS GETTING IN LINE. HE IS. [LAUGHTER] LEAN AND MEAN OUT THERE. AL: I AM TELLING YOU. A COUPLE OF FLAGS HERE. SEPARATE FILES. 22, RECEIVING TEAM. 10 YARD PENALTY FROM THE SPOT OF THE FILE. --DETROIT NOW HAS THE BALL AT THEIR OWN 11 YARD LINE. TO THE 14. KIRK: ONE OF THE THINGS IMPRESSIVE WITH DETROIT, THEY HAVE MOVED HIM OVER TO THE RIGHT SIDE. I WAS TALKING TO HIS COACH BEFORE THE GAME. HE SAID PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW CHALLENGING THAT IS. IT IS LIKE TRYING TO MAKE A LEFT-HANDED LAYUP IN BASKETBALL. IT IS THE COMPLETE REVERSE OF WHAT YOU'RE USED TO DOING ON THE NOW HE IS BACK IN HIS FAMILIAR AL: FORMER NUMBER ONE PICK OUT OF OREGON. COMING UP A LITTLE SHORT IS THIRD AND 2. KIRK: THEY HAVE THEIR UNIFORMS ON. YOU USUALLY WANT TO HEAR A QUARTERBACK OR A RECEIVER. BUT THE LIONS HAVE DONE IT WITH THREE FIRST ROUNDERS ON THEIR ONE OF THE REASONS THEY ARE ONE OF THE TOP OFFENSIVE LINES IN AL: THEY DO PICK UP THE FIRST ONLY NEEDED A COUPLE. GIBBS MAKING THE CATCH THE SIDELINE, MOVING THE STICKS. KIRK: THEY MOVED HIM IN MOTION. BECAUSE THE CORNER DOES WITH HIM, THEY KNOW IT WILL BE A LITTLE SOFTER AND COVERAGE. THE LINEBACKER HAS A LONG WAY TO GO. GOOD RECOGNITION BY GOLF -- AL: MONTGOMERY. CHEWING UP GROUND YARDAGE. PLENTY OF TIME LEFT BUT YOU MIGHT AS WELL TAKE AS MUCH TIME OFF THE CLOCK AS YOU CAN. KIRK: THAT IS A GREAT POINT. BCA TALENTED LINES TEAM WITH DAN CAMPBELL -- WE SEE A TALN CAMPBELL -- WE SEE A TALENTED LIONS TEAM WITH DAN CAMPBELL. THEY NEED TO CLOSE OUT GAMES. SACK. BROOKS. COULD DO BUT TRY TO THROW THAT AWAY. AL: THEY RUN A DRAW HERE. TO THE 26 YARD LINE. GREEN BAY READY TO GET THE BALL BACK. KIRK: THERE TOP TWO CORNERS ARE OUT OF THIS DEFENSE FOR GREEN STOKES NOT PLAYING. ALEXANDER. ABLE TO GO. TRYING TO HOLD UP WITH SOME BACKUP CORNERS. AL: FOX IS NUMBER ONE IN THE LEAGUE AND PUNTING SINCE HE CAME INTO THE LEAGUE. THIS IS A SHORT ONE. IT WILL ROLL DEAD. A SHORT KICK. WE ARE IN THE FINAL MINUTE OF THE THIRD QUARTER. WE ARE COMING DOWN TO THE END OF KIRK: DETROIT IN THE FIRST HALF WERE THE OPPOSITE. IN THE THIRD QUARTER, THEY ONLY HAVE 17 YARDS. AL: HACKERS TRYING TO BUILD ON THAT LONG DRIVE -- PACKERS TRYING TO BUILD ON THAT LONG DRIVE WITH 16 MINUTES LEFT IN THE GAME. JONES IS TAKEN DOWN. IT IS THAT TIME OF THE MONTH. YOU SEE UP IN THE SKY. WHAT THEY CALL THE HARVEST MOON. BIG, BRIGHT HARVEST MEN. EVERY TIME I SEE THAT I THINK ABOUT OUR OLD BUDDY KEITH SECOND AND 7. 37 YARD LINE. KIRK: GOOD JOB OF GETTING THE BALL OUT OF HIS HANDS. MOVING THE POCKET. BALL OUT QUICKLY. AL: TRYING TO GO QUICKLY HERE BUT THEY WILL RUN OUT OF TIME. THEY SAY THE CLOCK DID NOT GO TO ZEROS. A BOMB. TO THE 4 YARD LINE. RULED A TEST. 45 YARDS. THE CLOCK WAS AT TRIPLE ZERO. THE SNAP WAS GOOD, THE PASS WAS GREAT. GREEN BAY IN BUSINESS TO START THE FOURTH QUARTER. 27-11 AL: FIRST DOWN AND GOAL FOR WE WILL SHOW YOU THE PLAY AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER. THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING. YOU WILL SEE IT IN A SECOND. FIRST AND GOAL AFTER A 44 YARD RECEPTION. FROM THE 9. PLAY CLOCK WINDING DOWN. LOVE THROWS. JADEN READ IS THERE. KIRK: VERY CLOSE. HE GETS THAT BALL IN THEIR. -- THERE. NOT ABLE TO GET HIS FEET DOWN. A HECK OF TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE. MAN-TO-MAN ON THE OUTSIDE. AL: BRANCH IS BACK IN THE GAME. BOTTOM OF YOUR SCREEN. COVERING THE SLOT. LOVE WILL KEEP IT HIMSELF, TOUCHDOWN, GREEN BAY. NINE YARDS. THAT DID NOT TAKE LONG. 1:02, 66 YARDS. KIRK: YOU HAVE TO RESPECT JORDAN LOVES FEET. HE HAS PROVEN THAT. YOU RUSH THREE. EVERYBODY IS LOOKING AT THE RECEIVERS ON THE PERIMETER. NOBODY THERE TO ACCOUNT FOR HE WILL TAKE THAT GLADLY FOR THE AL: JONES IS THE BACK. LOVE WILL KEEP IT. HE IS SHORT. JOHN COMINSKY SAVES IT. KEEP SAID A TWO POSSESSION GAME. MEANWHILE, AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT LOVE. KIRK: I THOUGHT HE HAD THE CORNER. HIS KNEE IS DOWN. A HECKUVA JOB FIGHTING THROUGH TO MAKE THE PLAY. AL: PRETTY CLEAR. KNEE GOES FIRST. HE IS DOWN. PRETTY CLEARLY. WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE END OF WE HAVE TO BRING YOU IN. WATCH THE CLOCK. AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER. >> THE CLOCK CLEARLY HAD ZERO BEFORE THE BALL WAS SNAPPED. ONCE AGAIN CLOCK HIT ZERO, IT SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN ON THE FIELD BY THE OFFICIALS. NOT A REVIEWABLE PLAY. AL: THAT IS SUCH A GREAT POINT. A LOT OF TIMES YOU WILL SEE THE PLAY CLOCK GO TO ZERO BUT THE OFFICIAL DOESN'T DO ANYTHING. YOU ARE SO RIGHT ABOUT THAT. NO WIGGLE ROOM. KIRK: THEY GOT AWAY WITH IT AND THEY CAPITALIZE. A RARE ONE-ON-ONE OPPORTUNITY AND IT IS A PERFECT THROW AND A GREAT CATCH. COMPARED TO WHAT THEY FACED LAST WEEK IN THE THIRD QUARTER, THIS IS NO PROBLEM. A DIFFERENT TEAM. AL: AT LEAST THEY MADE A GAME OUT OF IT. THIS PLACE WAS DEAD. KIRK: IT IS A LONG WAY TO GO. THIS GAME WAS OVER, 27-3. AL: THAT IS TODAY'S NFL. IT IS A CLICHE TO SAY NO LEAD IS SAFE. WE ARE GETTING CLOSE. KIRK: WE KEEP GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THE OFFENSE. BUT IT HAS BEEN THE DEFENSE THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS THAT HAVE GIVEN THE PACKERS A CHANCE TO GET THERE OFFENSE BACK OUT THERE AND GET THEM INTO THE GAME. AL: A LITTLE FLIP OUT IN THE FLAT. MONTGOMERY TAKES IT FOR A GAIN. SECOND DOWN AND SHORT. KIRK: JOHNSON IS THE PLAY CALLER. WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT HIM AS ONE OF THE ELITE PLAY CALLERS IN THE LEAGUE. 27-3 ON THE ROAD. YOU START TO WORK THE CLOCK AND BE SMART ABOUT NOT MAKING AN ERROR. NOW YOU GO BACK TO THE FIRST HALF MODE OF BEING AGGRESSIVE. TRYING TO PUT POINTS UP ON THE BOARD. AL: GIBBS ON A DRAW. WALKER MAKING THE TACKLE. KIRK: THIS OFFENSIVE LINE DOMINATED THE FIRST HALF. IN ORDER FOR THAT NOT TO HAPPEN AGAIN IN THE SECOND HALF, THE PACKERS HAVE BEEN BLITZING. ATTACKING THE RUN. SAFETIES COMING DOWN. WHEN YOU ROLL THE DICE LIKE THAT AS A DEFENSE, IT CREATES OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE RECEIVERS ON PLAY-ACTION TO GET SOME ONE ON ONE SHOT DOWNFIELD. AL: ALMOST A PERFECT BALANCE FOR THE LIONS OFFENSE. 26 RUNS, 25 PASSES. THIS WILL MAKE IT EVEN. FIRST DOWN, MONTGOMERY. HE PICKS UP ABOUT 13. KIRK: YOU LOVE TO SEE THE PATIENTS. RINSE AND REPEAT. OVER AND OVER AGAIN. YOU LOVE THE PLAY ACTION. INTO GREEN BAY TERRITORY. KIRK: PERFECT TECHNIQUE. LOOK AT THE DOUBLE-TEAMED. HE GETS UP RIGHT THERE. THAT IS TEXTBOOK. YOU SEE MONTGOMERY STARTING TO WEAR ON THE DEFENSE. AL: GIBBS GETS A TURN. HE HAS IT. THIRD DOWN AND 2. VAN NESS, A ROOKIE FROM IOWA, MAKES THE STOP. HE WAS THERE NUMBER ONE PICK. BIG THIRD AND 2 FOR THE PACKER GIBBS GOT IT. TO THE 39 YARD LINE. KIRK: IT IS FUN TO WATCH THESE CLIMBING UP. JACKSON, IT IS EASY THERE. PEOPLE WOULD BE SURPRISED. IF YOU DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT GIBBS, THE ROOKIE. HE IS PHYSICAL. AL: THESE DAYS YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF RUNNING BACKS DRAFTED IN THE FIRST ROUND. REACHING OUT AND MAKING THE GRAB, REYNOLDS. KIRK: I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT JOHNSON CHANGING HIS MODE. AGGRESSIVE MINDSET. ABLE TO TURN HIS BODY. ANOTHER FIRST AND 10 PLAY ACTION THE BIG OFFENSIVE LINE, JOHNSON ONE STEP AHEAD OF THEM. AL: 10:30 LEFT IN REGULATION. ANOTHER THING FEID IS -- GOFF IS REALLY GOOD AT, BALL HANDLING. KIRK: THAT IS PART OF HIS MATURATION. SECOND YEAR IN THIS SCHEME. WHEN YOU TALK TO HIS COACHES, THEY SAY HE IS A DIFFERENT GUY THAN HE WAS. HE IS UNDER CENTER A LOT WITH THE RUN GAME. THE MECHANICS WITH THAT PLAY-ACTION GAME. AL: SECOND AND 7. NOTHING HAPPENING. GOING NOWHERE. WALKER IN THE MIX. KIRK: GOOD PLAY BY THE ROOKIE. ABLE TO BOUNCE OFF AND GET SOME PENETRATION. HIS LITTLE SWIM TECHNIQUE. THAT IS WHAT HE IS KNOWN FOR FROM HIS DAYS AT AUBURN. USING HIS QUICKNESS. AL: THIRD DOWN AND 9. THEY KEEP IT ON THE GROUND. TAKING IT TO THE 11. A COUPLE OF YARDS SHY. GIBBS THAT TIME. GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH THESE KIRK: THAT AGGRESSIVE MINDSET. HOPE FOR SOME POSITIVE YARDS. THEY WANT TO GO WITH IT -- FOR IT HERE. AL: TRYING TO MAKE IT 34-17. A THREE POSSESSIONS SCORE IF YOU CAN GET INTO THE END ZONE. THEY LINE UP ANYWAY TO GO FOR TRYING TO DRAW THEM OFFSIDE? THAT IS ALL THEY WERE DOING. TRYING TO DRAW THEM OFFSIDE. KIRK: THAT IS A VICTORY FOR YOU HAVE TO GET TWO TOUCHDOWNS. BUT THEY COME UP WITH A STOP RIGHT DOWN THE FIELD. AL: 17 IS ALMOST SURELY OUT OF REACH. 13, YOU HAVE A SHOT. HE WILL ATTEMPT TO SHORT FIELD GOAL. HE HAS MADE A COUPLE TONIGHT. THIS ONE WILL BE ABOUT 30 YARDS. >> DURING THE FIELD, UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT, NUMBER SEVEN, DEFENSE. THE PENALTY WILL BE ENFORCED HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL FROM THE PREVIOUS SPOT. AL: THINK ABOUT THAT. THE FIELD GOAL WOULD'VE MADE IT 30-17. ON WALKER. TALK ABOUT A LATE FLAG. THE PACKER RETURN TEAM HAD ALREADY COME OUT AND THE LIONS KICKOFF OUT. KIRK: YOU CAN SEE THE OFFICIALS COME TOGETHER. >> IT IS CLEARLY A FOUL. UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT. THAT IS WHAT HE DID ON THAT AL: THEY TAKE THE THREE POINTS OFF THE BOARD BUT NOW THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT SEVEN, OBVIOUSLY. THEY CAN CHEW UP SOME CLOCK SHOULD THEY PREFER AS WELL. MONTGOMERY SLIDING TO THE 3. KIRK: WALKER HAS WORKED SO HARD. HE HAS TALKED ABOUT MEDITATION, MATURITY, BEING THE GUY THEY COUNT ON. A GUIDE TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS. HE GOT KICKED OUT OF A COUPLE OF GAMES LAST YEAR. HE HAS WORKED VERY HARD ON THAT PART OF HIS GAME. AL: HE HAS BEEN IN ON A TON OF TACKLES TONIGHT. WELL INTO DOUBLE FIGURES. THAT WAS A KILLER. UNLESS THEY CAN STOP HIM HERE AND HOLD THEM TO ANOTHER FIELD STUFFED IN THE BACKFIELD IS OFF. KIRK: THEY ARE DOING WHAT THEY CAN UPFRONT. THEY HAVE PLAYED SO WELL. GETTING PENETRATION AND MAKING GREAT PLAYS. NUMBER 95 WAS THERE TO HELP OUT. AL: THIRD AND GOAL. ANOTHER HUGE PLAY FOR THE GREEN BAY DEFENSE. TRYING TO KEEP IT A TWO POSSESSION LEAD. THE BALL IS HANDED OFF AND STOP AT THE 1 YARD LINE. KIRK: THEY LINED UP TO GO FOR IT WHEN IT WAS FOURTH AND 2. DAN CAMPBELL CALL A TIMEOUT. NOW WITH THIS OFFENSIVE LINE, THE WAY YOU SAW MONTGOMERY WORK IT ALL THE WAY DOWN. AL: WORST CASE, YOU DON'T GET IT, GREEN BAY HAS A 99 YARD FIELD. KIRK: NOW YOU'RE DOWN TO SIX MINUTES. AL: FOURTH AND GOAL. HANDED OFF AND INTO THE END ZONE GOES MONTGOMERY. HE HAS CARRIED THE BALL 26 TIMES. 84 YARDS TONIGHT. KIRK: THEY HAD THREE TIGHT ENDS TO THE RIGHT. THEY WENT RIGHT BEHIND THE RIGHT WATCH HIM TURN HIS BODY AWAY FROM THE HOLE TO OPEN IT UP. ACTUALLY TAKES WALKER WITH HIM. THE LINEBACKER. HE TURNS HIS BODY THE OTHER WAY AND OPENS THE HOLE AL: EXTRA POINT OF SOME SIGNIFICANCE. IT IS A THREE SCORE GAME. THE WALKER PENALTY TAKES THE FIELD GOAL OFF THE BOARD AND SETS THEM UP FOR SEVEN. THEY CASH IN HERE. 34-17. ILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. CHICAGO AND WASHINGTON NEXT WEEK ON THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL. MEANWHILE, THERE IS WALKER BEING TALKED TO ABOUT THAT LEAPING FOUL THAT WAS VERY COSTLY. GREEN BAY DOWN BY 17. OUT OF THE END ZONE. I STOP. -- NICE STOP. TRIP UP AT THE 15 YARD LINE. THE PACKERS IN ALL LIKELIHOOD WILL GO TO 2-2. THE VIKINGS AND BEARS ARE WINLESS AT THIS POINT. KIRK: IT IS BEEN INCREDIBLE THE SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE VIKINGS AND BEARS. THIS IS A BIG WIN FOR THE LIONS. THEY MOVED TO 3-1. THEY HAVE HAD ONLY -- SUCCESS IS VERY NEW TO THEM. IN THIS CULTURE. AL: A GOOD PART OF THE CROWD HAS STAYED FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. SOMETIMES IN A BLOWOUT SITUATION YOU LEAVE EARLY BUT THE CROWD -- THERE ARE EIGHT HOME GAMES AND THE MILWAUKEE GROUP OR THE SOUTHERN WISCONSIN GROUP, THIS IS ONE OF THEIR TWO GAMES AS THE CATCH IS MADE BY ROMEO DOUBS. YOU LET THOSE PEOPLE HAVE PRIORITY FOR TWO GAMES. AND ANOTHER REASON IS THERE IS A LOT OF DETROIT FANS HERE AND IT IS A NICE NIGHT. LOVE, HOPPING AROUND. HE FIRES THAT ONE AWAY AND ALMOST HAS IT PICKED OFF. KIRK: DETROIT FANS ARE THINKING THIS IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. THERE IS A LOT TO LIKE WITH THIS YOUNG TEAM. YOU LOOK AT THEM AND IT IS ALL ABOUT WHO WILL BE ABLE TO STAY HEALTHY. THEY HAVE TO STAY HEALTHY LIKE EVERY TEAM. YOU LOOK AT THEIR SCHEDULE AND THE WAY IT WORKS OUT THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WITH CAROLINA. THEY ARE AT TAMPA AND BALTIMORE. VEGAS, RAMS, BEARS. THEY COULD LEGITIMATE GET AL: NO DOUBT. CAUGHT AT THE 40. KIRK: AND WE SHOULD MENTION NOT JUST FOR TONIGHT BUT BIG PICTURE TO SEE RYAN BRANCH COME BACK AFTER HAVING BEEN CARTED OFF -- THAT IS SIGNIFICANT AND GO NEWS. AL: THIRD AND ONE. BRANCH HAS THAT MOUTHPIECE. THERE IT IS. I WATCHED THE OPENING GAME AND I WONDERED IF IT WAS A BINKY, A PACIFIER. KIRK: [LAUGHTER] AL: A PACIFIER. AND THAT IS RUSTLED FOR AN -- WRESTLED FOR AND CAUGHT. HE'S SOMEHOW SOMEWAY MADE A BEAUTIFUL GRAB LAST WEEK THIS ONE FOR 35 YARDS.

KIRK: WHEN YOU HAVE AARON RODGERS YOU ESSENTIALLY HAVE THE COORDINATOR AS THE QUARTERBACK. NOW YOU HAVE A GUY THAT MADE HIS FIFTH CAREER START TONIGHT. A VERY DIFFERENT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES. HE HAS A LOT OF TALENT. A YOUNG GUY IN HIS FOURTH YEAR IN THE SYSTEM, HE NEEDS WRAPS. LAST WEEK WAS SYMBOLIC OF WHERE RECORDERS OF FRUSTRATING MOMENTS AND ONE QUARTER OF EUPHORIA BUT THEY CAME BACK TO WIN THE GAME.
