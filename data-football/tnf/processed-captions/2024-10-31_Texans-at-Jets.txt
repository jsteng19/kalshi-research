THERAPY IS, NOT ENOUGH SCREEN TIME, EVERYONE IS MAD ABOUT SOMETHING AND THIS IS HIS TIME IN THE SUN. STEVEN SIMS RUNS IT BACK, SEAN IS TONIGHT'S REFEREE. >> RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE. >> HOLDING BY THE RECEIVING TEAM, 10 YARD PENALTY. FIRST DOWN. >> C.J. STROUD PLAYED COLLEGE FOOTBALL AT OHIO STATE, NUMBER TWO OVERALL PICK BEHIND BRYCE YOUNG, YOUNG WENT TO THE PANTHERS AND STROUD HAD A TREMENDOUS SEASON, OFFENSE OF ROOKIE OF THE YEAR, HIS RATIO WAS GREAT LAST YEAR, THIS YEAR, GOOD. HE STARTS FROM THE 16 YARD LINE. JUST BRING PRESSURE, THE PASS IS BROKEN UP. THE BACKUP TIGHT END D.J. REED BREAKING IT UP, SECOND DOWN AND 10. >> WE WILL SEE HOW BOBBY SLOAN ATTACKS AGAINST THE JETS. WE TALKED ABOUT TOP RECEIVERS, NICO COLLINS HOPEFULLY BACK IN ANOTHER WEEK. AS A DUO THEY LEAD THE NFL FOR THOUSANDS OF YARDS RECEIVING SO HOW WILL THEY OVERCOME LOSSES? >> ROBERT WOODS, A LITTLE HESITATION IN THE HANDOFF IN THE BACKFIELD. ANOTHER FLAG ON THE PLAY, TO PENALTIES IN THE FIRST NINE SECONDS. >> WILLIAMS TRYING TO GET A QUICK JUMP ON THE SNAP COUNT. YEAH, THE JETS ARE THE MOST PENALIZED TEAM, PART OF THE REASON THEY HAVE BEEN SO INCONSISTENT. >> OFFSIDES BY THE DEFENSIVE TACKLE, THE NUMBER WAS 95. >> THERE IT IS, IT IS WILLIAMS AND SECOND DOWN AND FIVE, SO JEFF TOOK OVER THREE GAMES AGO. 0-3 AFTER ROBERT SALA WAS 2-3 AND FIRED AFTER A TRIP TO LONDON. HOLBROOK IS CALLING DEFENSIVE SIGNALS SO DOING DOUBLE DUTY IS STROUD. THAT IS INCOMPLETE. ROBERT WOODS WAS THE INTENDED RECEIVER. THIRD AND FIVE FOR THE TEXANS. >> THIS DEFENSE IS BEING CHALLENGED, HUSTLING, TACKLING, HERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO GET STROUD OFF THE FIELD. WITHOUT COLLINS YOU'VE GOT THE TIGHT ENDS, SEE IF SOMEBODY CAN SEPARATE FROM THIS COVERAGE. GIVEN AN OPTION. >> RECEIVER IS SET, FINDS THE OPEN MAN, TANK DELL MAKING THE CATCH. HE WAS NICKNAMED BY HIS MOTHER, HE WAS A TANK WHEN HE WAS THROWING. 16 YARDS. >> C.J. STROUD, GREAT JOB, NOT FOOLED AT ALL, HE WAS TELLING ME BEFORE THE GAME HE HATES TO LOSE BUT HAS CONFIDENCE IN TANK DELL, XAVIER HUTCHINSON STEPPING. THE VETERAN WILL GET AN OPPORTUNITY. >> OFF THE FAKE, RUNNING AROUND, FIRES. SECOND DOWN AND 10. NICO COLLINS HAS BEEN GREAT, HE WAS LEADING THE LEAGUE WHEN HE WENT OUT WITH AN INJURY BUT HE IS BACK. >> GREAT TO SEE HIM GET BACK AND IF YOU HAVE NOT FOLLOWED THE TEXANS, ONE THING THAT IS MOST CONCERNING IS C.J. STROUD PRESSURED AS MUCH AS ANY CORNERBACK. KENYON GREEN HAS HAD HIS ISSUES SO IF YOU WILL HAVE TO GET THE RUNNING GAME GOING. >> PASS IS CAUGHT, DALTON SCHULTZ TACKLED BY QUINCY WILLIAMS. THEY STARTED WITH FIVE CONSECUTIVE PASSES, THIRD-FOUR. EVENTUALLY WE WILL SEE A LOT OF JOE MIXON TONIGHT, HE HAS DONE THE JOB AS AARON RODGERS WAITS ON THE SIDELINE. JOE MIXON CAME FROM CINCINNATI AND HAS BEEN GREAT. DAVANTE ADAMS CAME OVER TWO WEEKS AGO, READY FOR THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY, KEEP IT GOING ON A THIRD DOWN AND FOUR. SIXTH IN A ROW, AVOIDS THE SACK, THROWS UNDER PRESSURE. HAASON REDDICK HELD OUT, GOT HIM IT A TRADE BUT HE SAID HE WANTED A NEW CONTRACT, HERE HE IS. >> HE RUNS HIMSELF INTO PRESSURE WITH REDDICK, DOES ENOUGH TO AFFECT STROUD. MCDONALD HELPING TO CLEAN THAT UP, JUST NOWHERE TO GO WITH THAT FOOTBALL. >> THE PUNTER IS TOMMY TOWNSEND. XAVIER IS BACK, TOWNSEND CAME FROM KANSAS CITY, WINNING SUPER BOWLS WITH THE CHIEFS. HIGH FLOATING CAKE, CAUGHT AT THE 11TH YARD LINE AND THAT IS WHERE AARON RODGERS AND THE JETS 5:00 P.M. EASTERN TIME. YOUR GO THE JETS, ROGERS OUT OF THE PISTOL, STRAIGHT DROPBACK, THROWS DOWN THE SIDELINE, OUT OF BOUNDS, RECOVERED BY DEREK STINGLEY, SECOND AND 10. AARON RODGERS HAS HAD BETTER YEARS, MANY BETTER. 12 TOUCHDOWNS, SEVEN INTERCEPTIONS, NOT BAD. 60 2%, 237 YARDS PER GAME. >> THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES WE'VE SEEN DAVANTE ADAMS GET DOWNFIELD AND HE WAS OPEN, ROGERS MISSES IT. >> DATA IS DROPPED AT THE 15 YARD LINE, TRIES TO GET IT TO BREECE HALL WHO IS A GOOD CATCHER. OUTSTANDING RUNNER. QUICKLY 3-10. -- THIRD-10. >> APPEARS TO PLAYS. A MISSED GO BALL AND A DROP FOR FIVE YARDS BY BREECE HALL. THIRD AND 10. >> DATE PLAYS, 64 HOUSTON, NO RUNS, ALL PASSES. PASS NUMBER NINE, LOOK OUT, SACKED AT THE 1-YARD LINE. THAT WAS NICO COMING IN FOR THE SACK. ANOTHER GUY THEY PICKED UP. A FREE AGENT FROM TENNESSEE LAST YEAR. GETS THE SACK HERE. >> THIRD AND LONG WITH ANDERSON AND HUNTER, THEY ARE SO QUICK THAT IT FREES UP THE MIDDLE, THEY END UP BRINGING SIX AND HOW GREAT IS IT TO SEE THEM SHOWING WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH 11 AND A HALF SACKS WITH TENNESSEE, FIRST WITH THE TEXANS. >> THOMAS MORSTEAD RIGHT AT THE END OF THE END ZONE, LITTLE ROOM TO GET IT AWAY BUT HE DOES AND IT IS OUT OF BOUNDS MIDFIELD. TEXANS WILL TAKE OVER AT THAT SPOT WITH 11 MINUTES 44 SECONDS REMAINING IN THE OPENING QUARTER. >> LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR NEXGEN STATS. LOOK AT THE INTERIOR OFFENSE OF LINE IN THE FIRST EIGHT WEEKS OF THE SEASON. THE MOST SACKS IN THE ENTIRE NFL, YOU SEE THAT PRESSURE AND YOU GOT THE JETS CREATING RUSHER MUCH LIKE THE HOUSTON DEFENSE. YOU SAID IT, A LOT OF PASSES. WE WILL SEE IF THEY CREATE MORE BALANCE. >> RUNNING BACK IN THE SACK AND BEFORE JOE MIXON CAN GET IT ANOTHER FLAG. >> FALSE START, OFFENSE, FIVE YARD PENALTY. >> HE LEADS THE LEAGUE IN PENALTIES. >> 13TH ACCEPTED PENALTY THIS YEAR, THE MOST, A LOT OF NEGATIVITY TONIGHT, THE MOST IN THE NFL. INTERIOR MOST PRESSURE, LEFT TACKLE, MOST PENALTIES BUT IT WILL GET BETTER. AL: THE JETS IN A MOMENT OF DARKNESS CHOSE TO WORE BLACK TONIGHT. -- CHOSE TO WEAR BLACK FINALLY A RUN BUT ONLY A COUPLE. YOU BEGIN TO THINK HE WILL LOSE A LITTLE BIT, NOT THIS GUY THIS KIRK: I AM WITH YOU. WATCHING HIM, GOING BACK TO OKLAHOMA AND THE BENGALS, A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT HIS BEST YEARS WERE BEHIND HIM. I THINK HE ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A ROOKIE. HE LOOKS MORE EXPLOSIVE, AVERAGING ALMOST 5 YARDS PER CARRY. I THINK A CHANGE OF SCENERY HELPED HIM OUT. AL: THAT WAS A GAIN OF TWO, SECOND AND 13. LOOK OUT FROM BEHIND, SACKED. THAT TIME IT IS D.J. REED. TRACK HIM DOWN FROM BEHIND. KIRK: YOU HAVE D.J. REED LINED UP ON DALTON SCHULTZ, THE TIGHT END, THEY WILL BRING THE CORNER PRESSURE. ONE TOO MANHY ON THE LEFT SIDE, REED IS UNDERSIZED BUT PLAYS WITH AN ATTITUDE. AL: DOES NOT BLITZ A OFTEN. IT IS HIS FIRST SACK IN SIX YEARS. THIRD AND 21 NOW. STROUD, STEPPING UP. IT IS ALMOST INTERCEPTED AT THE 42 YARD LINE. JALEN MILLS DIVING AT A PASS INTENDED FOR TANK DELL. RODGERS GETTING READY TO GO BACK TO WORK. KIRK: YOU GET A LITTLE PRESSURE FROM REDDICK. HE HAS SUCH GOOD GET OFF. C.J. STROUD STEPS UP AND FLICKS THE WRIST. CLARK ALMOST STEPS IN FRONT FOR A HUGE INTERCEPTION. REFEREE: PLEASE RESET THE GAME THANK YOU. AL: WE HAVE PLAYED 4:45. THREE PENALTIES, THREE SACKS. AND TOWNSEND'S SECOND PUNT, AND HERE IS A FLAG AGAIN. HE GOT KNOCKED DOWN. IS IT RUNNING INTO OR ROUGHING? HE IS ON THE GROUND. TOMMY TOWNSEND GETS RUN INTO. THE TEXANS RIGHT NOW -- REFEREE: PERSONAL FOUL, ROUGHING THE KICKER. 15 YARD PENALTY, AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. AL: HOW MANY TIMES THIS YEAR HAVE WITHIN THE PLACE KICKER OR THE PUNTER GET RUN INTO. KIRK: TERRY MACAULEY SAYING HE HIT THE PLANT LEG. THAT IS ROUGHING. THE JETS DEFENSE DOES ITS JOB, A CHANCE TO GET THE FOOTBALL BACK. ANOTHER MICROCOSM OF THEIR SEASON. AL: THAT WAS A FOURTH AND 21. A FIRST DOWN AND THE BALL IS ON THE 49 OF THE JETS. STROUD HAS STARTED 2-7 FOR 22 YARDS. MIXON. PICKS UP ABOUT THREE. SECOND DOWN AND 7. KIRK: TAKING A LOOK AT THE PUNTER. HE WAS RUN INTO ON THE PLANT FOOT. HOPEFULLY HE IS OK. DEMECO RYANS TRYING TO GET THIS OFFENSE GOING. SUCH POTENTIAL, EVEN WITH DIGGS AND COLLINS DOWN. THEY ARE TRYING TO SET UP THE PLAY-ACTION GAME. AL: TRYING AGAIN. BIG ENOUGH HOLE. CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN. IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND SHORT. KIRK: KENYON GREEN TAKES A SO MUCH, THE FANS GET FRUSTRATED WITH HIM AT LEFT GUARD. WATCH THIS A BLOCK. GET INTO HIM, ENGAGE AND THEN BURY HIM. LOOK AT THE WHOLE OPEN UP FOR AL: SOLOMON THOMAS GETS HURT ON THE PLAY. HE HAS BEEN HAVGOES TO THE SIDEL WILL CHECK THEM OUT IN THE BLUE TENTS. KIRK: ONE OF HIS OWN PLAYERS. GETS BLOCKED INTO HIS LOWER BODY. GOOD TO SEE HIM WALKING THAT OFF. TEXANS NOT ABLE TO PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN ON THE RUN BY MIXON. THIRD AND SHORT. AL: THIRD AND INCHES, JUST INSIDE THE 40 YARD LINE. STILL EARLY IN THE FIRST TO THE OUTSIDE HE GOES. MIXON, BOUNCING OFF TACKLES! RUNNING THROUGH TACKLES, ALL THE WAY TO THE 11 YARD LINE! WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MIXON IN HIS EIGHTH SEASON, HOW MUCH JUICE DOES HE HAVE LEFT? THAT SHOWS IT. KIRK: CLEMENS IS ABLE TO WORK AROUND GREEN. THE CUT AND PICKS UP THE FIRST HE THROWS THE SHOULDER. THIS IS A DIFFERENT JOE MIXON. PHYSICALITY, RUNNING THROUGH WOULD BE TACKLES. CHUCK CLARK COMING UP. WHAT AGAIN. AL: 29 YARD PICKUP FOR MIXON. OGUNBOWALE IS IN THE BACKFIELD. DARE HAS IT, GOES NOWHERE, STUFFED BY QUINNEN WILLIAMS. SECOND DOWN AND 11. KIRK: A GOOD JOB ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE JETS DEFENSE OF FLOWING TO THE FOOTBALL, NOT TAKING A PLAY OFF. HE WANTED TO CUT THAT BACK BUT THERE WAS NO ROOM BECAUSE OF THE EFFORT ON THE BACKSIDE. THIS IS WHERE YOU MISSED COLLINS AND DIGGS, DOWN IN THESE AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE TO MAKE QUICK DECISIONS AS A QUARTERBACK. THIS IS WHERE TANK DELL IN THE SLOT TO THE LEFT HAS TO GET A CHANCE TO GET INTO AN OPEN HOLE. AL: STROUD PRESSURED, LOSES THE BALL! THE JETS COME UP WITH THE FOOTBALL INSIDE THE 20 YARD LINE. WILL MCDONALD IS THE MAN WHO RECOVERED IT. QUINNEN WILLIAMS FORCE THE ISSUE. KIRK: THERE IT IS. THE INTERIOR. KENYON GREEN, THE LEFT GUARD. HE HAS TO BE ABLE TO MATCHUP. TOUGH TASK. QUINNEN WILLIAMS HAS BEEN COMING ON IN RECENT WEEKS. KNOTT'S THE BALL AWAY FROM C.J. NOW IT IS ON THE BALL AND WILL MCDONALD JUMPS ON TOP OF IT. THE JETS DEFENSE HAS COME UP WITH SOME BIG STOPS. AL: STROUD PLAYED THE WORST GAME OF HIS CAREER IN THIS BALLPARK LAST YEAR, LOSING TO THE JETS AND SUFFERING A CONCUSSION. OFF TO A RAGGED START TONIGHT. ON THE GROUND AND HE RECOVERS IT. HALL OFF TO A GOOD START ON THAT RUN WAS A LOT OF ROOM, GETS A LITTLE EXCITED, LOSES THE FOOTBALL AND COMES UP WITH IT. NOW YOU HAVE WILL ANDERSON DOWN FOR THE TEXANS. KIRK: JETS VERY FORTUNATE TO GET THAT FOOTBALL BACK. IT LOOKED LIKE HEWITT KNOCKED IT OUT. WILL ANDERSON IS ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS IN THE NFL. ANOTHER LOWER BODY. AL: HE WAS JUST NAMED THE OF 7.5 SACKS, HAVING A GREAT SEASON, NEEDS ASSISTANCE INTO THE BLUE TENT. THE JETS AFTER THE FUMBLE BY BREECE HALL, HE RECOVERS IT HIMSELF. NEVILLE HEWITT WILL COME IN. ANDERSON, AT LEAST OUT FOR THE MOMENT. UP THEY STILL HAVE FATUKASI. THEY HAVE THE DEAL HUNTER ON THE OTHER SIDE. KIRK: AUTRY HAS THE ABILITY TO PLAY INSIDE AND OUTSIDE. AL: SECOND AND 9. DAVANTE ADAMS. THAT IS PRETTY ODD AFTER ALL BAY. KIRK: HE IS BLOCKING STINGLEY DOWNFIELD. EVEN THOUGH HE HAS BEEN HERE A FEW WEEKS, IT IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS WITH DAVANTE ADAMS. JUST BECAUSE HE HAS THAT EXPERIENCE WITH AARON ROGERS DOES NOT MEAN HE HAS PICKED UP THE OFFENSE. HE DOES NOT THINK HE IS INVOLVED IN THE PLAY. AARON IMPROVISES SO OFTEN ON THE PLAY. HE IS LOOKING AT ADAMS, LIKE "WE HAVE TO GET THIS GOING." AL: THIRD AND 9. RODGERS. A LITTLE TOO FAR. THAT IS INCOMPLETE, INTENDED FOR MIKE WILLIAMS, WHO COULD VERY MUCH BE ON THE TRADING BLOCK. THE BOOS RAIN DOWN ON THE JETS. FOURTH AND 9. KIRK: LOOK AT ALL THE BODIES. SEVEN GUYS, ONE DROPS. THEY STILL BRING THE NICKEL, PITRE. BECAUSE OF THAT PRESSURE, AARON ROGERS NOT SETTLED, NOT COMFORTABLE. AL: THOMAS MORSTEAD. DRAFTED IN 2009. HE AND MATTHEW STAFFORD ARE THE ONLY PLAYERS REMAINING FROM THAT DRAFT. STAFFORD WITH NUMBER 1. THAT IS OUT OF BOUNDS AROUND THE 11. , OF COURSE, ON THE TRADING BLOCK. TALKING ABOUT BEING MOVED FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW. FINALLY THEY MAKE THE MOVE ANY WINDS APPEAR WITH HIS OLD BUDDY. KIRK: EVERYONE EXPECTED IT WOULD WORK OUT IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE. THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND A RHYTHM. AL: THIS DRIVE STARTS AT THE 13 YARD LINE. FINDING A CREASE, MIXON TACKLED BY NUMBER 52. IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN. KIRK: THIS IS A DEFENSE, AS ATHLETIC AS THEY ARE, AS MUCH AS THEY CAN PRESSURE THE QUARTERBACK -- YOU HAVE YOUR TWO STARTING SAFETIES DOWN, YOU'RE STARTING MIDDLE LINEBACKER, C.J. MOSLEY, DOWN. YOU THINK IF YOU COULD ATTACK IT WOULD BE IN THE INTERIOR. AL: SECOND AND 3. OFF HE GOES AGAIN. MAINTAINS HIS BALANCE AND PICKED UP A NICE GAIN BUT A FLAG IS THE TEXANS ARE ALREADY STARTING BACK. REFEREE: HOLDING BY THE OFFENSE, NUMBER 87. 10 YARD PENALTY, REPEAT SECOND IT WAS A 17 YARD GAIN, IN INSTEAD IT IS STOVER WITH THE PENALTY. KIRK: HE IS JUST TRYING TO HELP. HE IS TRYING TO PUSH ALL OF HER OUT. HE IS ABLE TO GET AWAY SO HE HAS TO GRAB ONTO THE JERSEY. THAT PLAY HAD A CHANCE TO BE A BIG ONE. AL: MEANWHILE, YOU HAVE D.J. REED GETTING ASSISTANCE AS HE MOVES OVER TO THE SIDELINE. COMING OUT AT LEAST FOR ONE PLAY AS HE TROTS TO THE SIDELINE. AFTER THE PENALTY, IT WILL BE 5:30 LEFT IN THE FIRST QUARTER, SECOND AND 11. FROM THE 12. FOUR-MAN RUSH, ENOUGH TO GET HIM. BACK ON THE GROUND AT THE 7-YARD KIRK: IT IS NOT THAT WE ARE PICKING ON KENYON GREEN BUT HE HAS BEEN A ROUGH YEAR. HE GOT BENCHED LAST WEEKEND JARRETT PATTERSON CAME IN BUT HE GOT HURT. RIGHT NOW HE IS GETTING OVERPOWERED. QUINNEN WILLIAMS GOES RIGHT THROUGH HIM. WE HAVE SEEN HIM GET AROUND WITH QUICK THIS. THAT TIME HE USES POWER TO GO RIGHT THROUGH HIM. IT IS A COMBINATION OF GREEN STRUGGLING AND QUINNEN WILLIAMS PLAYING UP TO HIS LEVEL THE LAST THREE OR FOUR WEEKS. AL: MEANWHILE, THE PASS OUT TO THE 18 YARD LINE GOES TANK DELL. IT IS FOURTH DOWN AND 6. HERE COMES THE PUNT GROUP. KAYLEE: AFTER TOMMY TOWNSEND GOT RUN INTO ON HIS LAST PUNCH HE CAME TO THE SIDELINES, TOOK A COUPLE PRACTICE PUNTS INTO THE NET, GAVE A THUMBS UP. HE USED A MASSAGE GUN ON HIS RIGHT CALF AND EVEN PRACTICED HOLDING. AL: THERE HE IS. HE IS BACK. XAVIER GIPSON IS SET UP INSIDE HIS 30. TOWNSEND WILL PUT IT IN THE AIR FOR THE SECOND OFFICIAL TIME THE HE WENT INTO THE TENT. THE JETS BEGINNING THERE DRIVE FROM THE 31-YARD LINE. A GAIN OF EIGHT. RODGERS TONIGHT IS 0-4. IN HIS ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER, NOW IN HIS 20TH SEASON, HE HAS NEVER GONE 0-5 TO START A GAME. KIRK: IT IS AN OFFENSE THAT HAS POTENTIAL BASED ON THE PIECES THEY HAVE. IT HAS BEEN VERY INCONSISTENT. THAT IS THE THING THAT HAS BEEN DRIVING AARON ROGERS AND EVERYBODY CRAZY. AL: THEY PUT BRAELON ALLEN IN A TWO-BACK SET. OFF TO THE RACES GOES BREECE HALL. GIVES THE CROWD SOMETHING TO CHEER ABOUT. A GAIN OF 16. KIRK: THE TIGHT END IS ABLE TO STEAL IT AND THE TACKLE ON THE LEFT SIDE, SMITH, IS ABLE TO GET AROUND. 17, ADAMS, ABLE TO HELP OUT. IF YOU GET BREECE HALL OUT THERE , HE CAN DO SOME DAMAGE. HE IS A GREAT RECEIVER OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. WHEN HE SQUARES THOSE SHOULDERS UP, HE IS A TALENTED BACK. AL: TODD DOWNING TOOK OVER AS THE PLAY CALLER FROM NATHANIEL HACKETT. 'S FIRST COMPLETION IS FOR A LOSS. AARON FINALLY GETS A COMPLETION BUT BREECE HALL LOSES TWO. SECOND AND 12. KIRK: TO'OTO'O, WHO MISSED LAST WEEK, JUST EYED TIME. THEY TRIED TO SELL IT. THE OFFENSE OF LINE MIGHT HAVE TIPPED THEIR HAND EARLY. WATCH 39. HE IS OUT THERE TO BEAT BREECE NO CHANCE THAT PLAY HAD BECAUSE OF THE INSTINCTS BY 39. AL: ADAMS MOVING. RODGERS GOES TO HIM. HE IS COVERED IMMEDIATELY AND TAKEN DOWN BY KAMARI LASSITER. KAYLEE: WHEN WILL ANDERSON CAME OFF THE FIELD YOU SAW HIM PUTTING VERY LITTLE WEIGHT ON THE LEFT LEG. HE SPENT EIGHT MINUTES IN THE BLUE MEDICAL TENT. HE CAME OUT AND DID SOME DRILLS TO TEST IT OUT. HE LOOKS TO HAVE A VERY HEAVY TAPE JOB ON HIS LEFT ANKLE. AL: HE IS BACK IN THE GAME ON THIRD DOWN AND 7. BRAELON ALLEN IS IN THE PASS IS BEHIND WILSON BUT HE IS ABLE TO REACH BACK, MAKE THE CATCH AND PICK UP THE FIRST GARRETT WILSON, REACHING BACK AND SAVING IT, PICKS UP THE FIRST. KIRK: THAT IS A GREAT JOB BY AARON ROGERS. LOOK AT STINGLEY LOSING GROUND. HE KNEW RIGHT AWAY. EVEN THOUGH THE BALL WAS BEHIND WILSON A LITTLE BIT, IT IS HIS RECOGNITION OF WHERE THE SOFT SPOT WAS VERSUS THAT PRESSURE. WILSON MAKES A GREAT PLAY ON THE AL: HIS 52ND RECEPTION, LEADS THE TEAM. HALL, NOWHERE TO ROAM. SECOND DOWN. THAT MIGHT TAKE US TO THE END OF THE QUARTER. YOU NEVER KNOW WITH AARON. KIRK: THIS IS AN OFFENSE THAT HAS BEEN ONE DIMENSIONAL. A LATE FLAG JUST CAME IN. AL: SHAWN HOCHULI -- THE CROWD WANTS A FACEMASK AFTER LOOKING AT THE REPLAY. REFEREE: PERSONAL FOUL, FACE MASK, NUMBER 91. KIRK: WHERE WAS THAT LAST WEEK WITH OUR GAME BETWEEN MINNESOTA AND L.A.? THAT WAS A LATE FLAG. I DO NOT KNOW IF REPLAY HELP WITH THAT. THE PLAY WAS OVER AND THEN THE FLAG CAME IN. THE RIGHT CALL -- YOU LOVE TO SEE THE RIGHT CALL BEING MADE. AL: THE CROWD SAW AND IN THE FLAG CAME OUT. NOT THAT THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE. THE OFFICIALS WERE TALKING ABOUT IT IS SORT OF MUTED TONIGHT. KIRK: YEAH. VERY DIFFERENT FROM BEFORE. AL: ABSOLUTELY. DO THAT. AL: A LITTLE TOSS, PLENTY OF ROOM, ALL THE WAY TO THE END ZONE! MALACHI CORLEY, A ROOKIE OUT OF WESTERN KENTUCKY. 19 YARDS. INTO THE END ZONE HE GOES. KIRK: THE QUESTION IS, DID HE DROP THE FOOTBALL BEFORE HE CROSSES THE PLANE. IT WILL BE VERY, VERY CLOSE. AL: THAT IS WHAT DEMECO RYANS IS LOOKING AT. HE DOES NOT HAVE TO BECAUSE ALL SCORING PLAYS GET REVIEWED. KIRK: THE EXECUTION IS GREAT. OH, BOY, HE DROP THAT BALL. DEFINITELY GOING TO TAKE A PEEK AT THAT. REFEREE: THE RULING ON THE FIELD OF A TOUCHDOWN IS UNDER FURTHER REVIEW. AL: TERRY MACAULEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY? TERRY: HE CLEARLY DROPS THE FOOTBALL BEFORE IT BREAKS THE PLANE. WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FOOTBALL AFTER THAT. IF THE JETS RECOVER, IT IS A TOUCHDOWN. IF THE TEXANS RECOVER, IT IS A TOUCHBACK. IF IT GOES OUT OF BOUNDS, IT IS A TOUCH BACK. IF IT JUST SITS THERE, IT GOES BACK TO THE JETS AT THE SPOT OF THE FUMBLE. REFEREE: THE RUNNER DROPPED THE BALL BEFORE CROSSING THE GOAL THE BALL THEN SUBSEQUENTLY ROLLED TO THE BACK OF THE END ZONE AND OUT OF THE END ZONE. IT IS A TOUCH BACK. IT IS A FIRST DOWN FOR THE DEFENSE. KIRK: THERE IT GOES ROLLING TOWARD THE BACK LINE. ONCE THE BALL HITS THE WHITE, IT IS THE TEXANS' BALL FOR A THE ROOKIE CORLEY, WHAT IN THE HECK IS HE THINKING? EVEN IF IT IS CLOSED, FINISH THE KIRK: DID IN THE END ZONE. AL: YOU SEE IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN. THE FIRST RUSH OF HIS CAREER, HE WILL REMEMBER FOREVER. MIXON LOOKING FOR ROOM. IN THAT SITUATION, HAD THE JETS RECOVER IN THE END ZONE, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A TOUCHDOWN. KIRK: KEEP IN MIND, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A TEAM THAT IS STRUGGLING. THEY HAVE LOST FIVE IN A ROW. THEIR INTERIM HEAD COACH HAS BEEN THE HEAD COACH FOR THREE GAMES. THEY ARE 2-6, THEY ARE DESPERATE TO GET A WIN. DESPERATE TO DO THE LITTLE THINGS RIGHT AND WE HAVE SEEN THE SAME ERRORS. THEY COULD BE UP SEVEN AND FEELING GOOD ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE. AL: SECOND AND 8. THE COVERAGE IS GOOD AND HE GETS TAKEN DOWN AT THE 25 YARD LINE BY QUINCY WILLIAMS. KIRK: THIS JETS DEFENSE IS DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO BAIL OUT THEIR OWN OFFENSE. WHETHER THE OFFENSE HAS GIVEN THE TEXANS GOOD FIELD POSITION, WHETHER IT WAS LIKE THIS, A MISTAKE THAT WAS MADE. THEY ARE ONCE AGAIN TRYING TO HELP THEIR OWN OFFENSE OUT, GET GOOD FIELD POSITION BACK TO AL: THE WAY THEY HAVE LOST THESE FIVE GAMES, IT HAS BEEN IN EVERY MANNER. AND NOW YOU HAVE THIS. THAT IS SOMETHING NEW. IT COMES BACK TO HAUNT THEM ON HALLOWEEN NIGHT. OVER THE MIDDLE, TOO HIGH, INTENDED FOR JOHN METCHIE. IT IS FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: ANOTHER PRESSURE. THIS TIME IT IS QUINNEN WILLIAMS AGAIN ON THE LEFT SIDE. GREEN, HE IS ACTUALLY DOWN. WILLIAMS WENT THROUGH HIM. HE WILL WORK IN. THE LEFT GUARD SPOT AGAIN FOR THE TEXANS. THE WRIT MOVE. IT IS NOT -- THE RIP MOVE. IT IS NOT ALWAYS ABOUT THE SACK. JOHN METCHIE DOES A GOOD JOB TRYING TO GET SEPARATION, WHICH HE GAINS. BUT BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE, IT GETS STROUD IN A LITTLE BIT OF A HURRY. AS HE THREW THE FOOTBALL, HE WAS HIT BY QUINNEN WILLIAMS. AL: GREEN WAS PICKED IN THE FIRST ROUND BACK IN 2022, CAME OUT OF LAST WEEK'S GAME, JARRETT PATTERSON CAME IN, HE GOT HURT. PATTERSON AN ACTIVE THIS WEEK AND NOW GREEN IS ON THE TURF AT METLIFE. EARLY IN THE SECOND QUARTER. IN A GAME BEING PLAYED IN QUICKSAND. KIRK: ZERO FLOW TWO THIS FOOTBALL GAME SO FAR. [LAUGHTER] AL: LESS THAN. KIRK: HOW ABOUT WE START OVER? AL: GOOD IDEA. WE WERE TALKING TO AARON ROGERS. HE WAS CONVINCING TELLING US HE KNEW A PATH. KIRK: VERY THOROUGH. AL: HE WENT THROUGH THE ENTIRE SCHEDULE. MORE STEAD -- TOMMY TOWNSEND. A FAIR CATCH. THEY WILL START FROM THERE. AARON, HE CAN SELL YOU A FEW THINGS. I WAS GOING TO BUY THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE AFTER THAT CONVERSATION. HE WENT THROUGH EVERY GAME AND SAID TWO WEST COAST TEAMS PLAYING 10:00 IN THE MORNING. MIAMI COULD BE ANYTHING. KIRK: HE ALSO COMPARED SOME OF HIS GREEN BAY TEAMS THAT GOT UP TO A SLOW START. HE TALKED ABOUT THIS TEAM AND THIS TEAM AND SAID THIS JETS TEAM IS BETTER THAN A LOT OF THOSE TEAMS IF YOU LOOK AT THE PERSONNEL. THE REST OF THEIR SCHEDULE, IF THEY CAN GET A WIN TONIGHT. AL: A SHORT GAME TO DAVANTE ADAMS. TACKLED BY MURRAY. A GAIN OF THREE. KIRK: HE HAS HAD SOME OPEN RECEIVERS. NOT ABLE TO GET ON TRACK AND BE ABLE TO FIND THEM. WHETHER IT IS HIM OTHER RECEIVERS, THEY ARE JUST NOT ON THE SAME PAGE. AL: TRYING TO PICK UP THE PACE IN THE NO-HUDDLE. THE PLAY CLOCK ALL THE WAY DOWN TO 12. KIRK: FOR A TEAM THAT HAS STRUGGLED WITH HER OPERATION AT TIMES -- LAST WEEK THEY HAD TO CALL A TIMEOUT. AL: THEY HAD TO USE ALL THREE IN THE FIRST HALF. THEY HAD A DELAY OF GAME ON A TWO-POINT CONVERSION. BREECE HALL FOR A MINIMUM GAIN. THIRD DOWN AND 6. KIRK: THIS DEFENSIVE LINE FOR HOUSTON HAS STRENGTHENED QUICK THIS ON THE INSIDE. THE ROTATE A LOT OF BODIES. AL: TOO EARLY FOR THAT. THAT IS A SHOT YOU NORMALLY SEE LATE IN THE FOURTH. THIRD AND 6. LOOK OUT. RODGERS SPINS AWAY, THROWS, COT. THE BALL IS OUT. DID HE HAVE CONTROL? THIS IS NEVILLE HEWITT. HE WILL TAKE THE BALL ALL THE WAY IN FOR A TOUCHDOWN. KIRK: THEY CALL THAT A CATCH AND A FUMBLE ON THE FIELD. AL: TYLER CONKLIN. KIRK: GREAT JOB. I AM SURE THEY WILL TAKE A PEEK AT THIS TO SEE IF HE HAS POSSESSION. THAT IS AN INCOMPLETION. THAT BALL WAS BOBBLED. AL: TOTALLY. KIRK: THE JETS THIS TIME CATCH A BREAK. AL: IT WILL BE OVERTURNED. SO WE HAD A NEAR-TOUCHDOWN FROM THE JETS. WE HAVE A SORT OF NEAR-TOUCHDOWN FOR THESE GUYS. KIRK: RODGERS HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO MOVE AROUND MUCH IN THE POCKET LATELY. THAT WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS. KNOCKED AWAY BY PITRE, CAUSING THE INCOMPLETION. THERE IS CONKLIN. THE RECIPIENT OF THE PASS. MEANWHILE, YOU HAVE THOMAS MORSTEAD BACK TO PUNT. HIS THIRD OF THE NIGHT. TOMMY TOWNSEND HAS ALREADY PUNTED THREE TIMES. STEVEN SIMS IS BACK FOR THE JETS , INSIDE THE 30-YARD LINE. SIMS, BACKING UP. BEAUTIFUL KICK. LOOK AT THIS BABY. WHOA! 2-YARD LINE. KIRK: THAT IS THE PLAY OF THE GAME. AL: BY FAR! THOMAS MORSTEAD. THAT IS 75 YARDS OF PERFECTION. ABSOLUTELY. NOT ONLY ANGLED DEEP, SIMS HAD TO GO OVER, AND THEN STAYS IN BOUNDS AND IS DOWNED AT THE 2-YARD LINE. KIRK: GREAT JOB BY BERNARD-CONVERSE NOT JUMPING. SOMETIMES THEY GET NERVOUS. HE LET THAT ROLLED ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE 2-YARD LINE. AL: THOMAS MORSTEAD HAS PUNTED 935 TIMES, THAT IS HIS LONGEST AVERAGE. MEANWHILE, YOU HAVE MIXON GIVING THEM SOME ROOM, TAKING IT OUT TO THE 7-YARD LINE. YOU ARE RIGHT, THAT IS THE PLAY OF THE GAME. KIRK: THIS IS THE THIRD LEFT GUARD. PATTERSON IS DOWN THIS WEEK. KENDRICK GREEN GETS HIS THAT IS 95, QUINNEN WILLIAMS, ACROSS FROM YOU. GOOD LUCK. AL: GODSPEED. SECOND AND 5. NICE MOVE AGAIN. KAYLEE: AN INJURY REPORT FOR YOU. WITH KENDRICK GREEN IN THE GAME, THAT IS BECAUSE KENYON GREEN IS IN THE X-RAY ROOM. WE ARE TOLD HE IS QUESTIONABLE TO RETURN BECAUSE OF A SHOULDER INJURY. WE SAW C.J. STROUD FALL ON IT WHEN HE CAME UP HURTING. FOR THE JETS DEFENSE, CORNERBACK D.J. REED IS QUESTIONABLE TO RETURN. HE IS BEING EVALUATED FOR A CONCUSSION. SOLOMON THOMAS IS QUESTIONABLE BECAUSE OF A KNEE. AL: BRANDIN ECHOLS COMES IN. 10 MINUTES TO PLAY IN THE HALF. STILL NO SCORE. KIRK: ECHOLS IN COLLEGE PLAY CORNER. IN THE NFL HE HAS BEEN PLAYING NICKEL. ECHOLS HAS THE ONLY TWO INTERCEPTIONS THIS ENTIRE YEAR. THIS JETS DEFENSE HAS ONLY TWO PICKS THIS YEAR. AL: NO PICKS FOR GARDNER OR REED EIGHT GAMES INTO THE SEASON. HUGE HOLE. MIXON HAS DONE ALL THE WORK ON THIS DRIVE. HE HAS TAKEN THEM FROM THE 2- YARD LINE TO THE 26TH. KIRK: THE DEFENSE SHOWS PRESSURE AND THEN THEY BAIL. IT MAKES IT EASIER FOR THE GUARD IN THE CENTER TO GET UP TO THE BACKERS. THAT PLAY JUST OPENED UP. THE INTERIOR IS WHERE THE TEXANS WANT TO WORK WITH C.J. MOSLEY AL: MIXON GETS A REST. OFF THE PLAY FAKE. THE CATCH IS MADE. TRYING TO STAY IN BOUNDS, THAT IS DALTON SCHULTZ. NICE MOVE, TURNS NOTHING INTO SOMETHING. BREAKING AWAY AND MAKING A GAIN OF SEVEN. KIRK: SAUCE GARDNER IS SUCH A GREAT PLAYER BUT AN AREA THAT HE HAS TO GET BETTER IS TACKLING. BOOM! RIGHT THERE, WRAPPED HIM UP. DALTON SCHULTZ IS A GOOD PLAYER BUT YOU HAVE QUINCY WILLIAMS AND SAUCE GARDNER AND POOR TACKLING. THAT LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD BE A LOSS OF THREE OR FOUR, BUT INSTEAD HE PICKS UP SEVEN YARDS. AL: THAT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE. IT HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF PUB. MIXON IS BACK. IS HE EVER. WHAT A NIGHT HE IS HAVING. A FLAG IS DOWN. REFEREE: HOLDING, BY THE OFFENSE, NUMBER 2. 10 YARD PENALTY, REPLAY SECOND KIRK: ROBERT WOODS, THE VETERAN, AGAINST JALEN MILLS. I APOLOGIZE EARLIER I WAS TALKING ABOUT CHUCK CLARK, HE IS ON THE I.R.. MILLS HAD TO STEP UP. WOODS, THAT IS WHAT HE IS KNOWN FOR. A GUY WHO IS A GREAT RECEIVER BUT PEOPLE APPRECIATE HOW PHYSICAL HE CAN BE. HE WRAPS UP AROUND THE SHOULDERS OF MILLS AND MAKES IT AN EASY CALL FOR THE OFFICIALS. AL: FIVE PENALTIES NOW ON THE TEXANS. THAT NEGATES WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A 15-YARD GAIN. STROUD IS UNDER PRESSURE AGAIN, FLUSHED OUT, FIRES DEEP DOWN FIELD. IT IS THE CATCH MADE? IT IS, AT THE 45-YARD LINE BY ROBERT WOODS. A GAIN OF 32. STROUD EXTENDS THE PLAY. WOODS, DOES HE STAY IN BOUNDS? KIRK: THE TEXANS WILL GO HURRY UP TO SEE IF THEY CAN GET THE BALL SNAPPED BEFORE THE RED FLAG COMES OUT. AL: STROUD, ON THE MOVE AGAIN. KIRK: ROBERT WOODS ADJUSTING THIS IS A DRILL THEY WORK ON BECAUSE OF STROUD'S ABILITY TO PLAYOFF SCHEDULE. THE LEFT FOOT IS DOWN FOR SURE, DOES THE OTHER FOOT DID DOWN? IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS. ONE OF PLAY BY THE VETERAN. HE MAKES UP FOR THE HOLDING CALL TO THE GATE THE 15-YARD GAIN. HE IS RUNNING A ROUTE AND SEES HIS QUARTERBACK IS IN TROUBLE. HE COMES BACK AND GIVES STROUD AN OPTION. AL: YOU SEE THE PEBBLES COME UP. THAT IS ALWAYS THE TELLTALE SIGN. SAUCE GARDNER MISS IS A TACKLE AND GETS BEAT ON THAT PLAY. STROUD ROLLING UNDER PRESSURE, THROWING AND THAT PASS IS INCOMPLETE. ANOTHER FLAG DOWN AS YOU HAD LEONARD TAYLOR COMING IN. MEANWHILE, SAUCE GARDNER IS WE WILL HEAR FROM SHAWN HOCHULI IN A SECOND. REFEREE: BEFORE THE PASS WAS THROWN, HOLDING, DEFENSE NUMBER 1. IT IS A FIVE YARD PENALTY AND AN AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. AL: THAT IS A BAD TRIFECTA. YOU HAVE A MISSED TACKLE, YOU GET BEATEN, YOU HAVE A PENALTY AND NOW YOU ARE HURT. KIRK: SAUCE GARDNER WAS VIEWED COMING INTO THIS YEAR -- THERE IS THE GRAB -- AS ONE OF THE TOP CORNERS IN THE LEAGUE. THIS YEAR, LIKE A LOT OF THE JETS PLAYERS, THINGS HAVE NOT BEEN THE SAME. TEAMS HAVE NOT AVOIDED HIM. THEY HAVE ACTUALLY GONE AFTER AL: HE HAD FIVE PENALTIES ALL OF LAST YEAR, HE HAS FIVE ALREADY THIS SEASON. DEFENSIVE ROOKIE OF THE YEAR IN '22. KIRK: TEXANS TRYING TO COME UP WITH ANSWERS BECAUSE OF THE LEFT GUARD POSITION. A LOT OF THE ANSWERS ARE MOVE STROUD AROUND, RUN THE FOOTBALL AND GET HIM AWAY FROM THE PRESSURE IN THE INTERIOR. AL: KENDALL SHEFFIELD COMES IN FOR SAUCE GARDNER. THERE GOES MIXON AGAIN. AN 11-YARD GAIN FOR JOE MIXON. WE HAVE ANOTHER INJURY. THAT IS 12 CARRIES FOR 86 YARDS. YOU HAVE WILL MCDONALD, WHO IS THE INJURED JETS THE INJURED JET. KIRK: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE LEFT GUARD. HOW WILL HE DO? HE HELPS CLEAN UP. HE GOT AWAY WITH A HOLD WITH HIS LEFT ARM. THEY ARE REALLY HAVING SUCCESS THROUGH THE INTERIOR. 99, MCDONALD, STILL DOWN ON THE AL: HE LEADS THE TEAM IN SACKS, HE HAS EIGHT. CLOCK TO 6:41. AL: STILL DOWN. YOU HAD ANDERSON GOING OUT FOR A WHILE FOR THE TEXANS. HE IS THEIR LEADING SACKER. NOW YOU HAVE MCDONALD DOWN. ADAMS AND RODGERS GOING, "I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. WE HAVE TO GET SOMETHING GOING." THIS DRIVE STARTED BACK AT THE 2 AFTER THAT 75-YARD PUNT. HERE IS THE MCDONALD PLAY AGAIN. KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE HE AVOIDS CONTACT. IN THE EFFORT TO AVOID IT, HE MUST HAVE TWEAKED SOMETHING. AL: A NONCONTACT INJURY. ACL LAST WEEK, GONE FOR THE SAUCE GARDNER ON THE SIDELINE FOR A MOMENT. KIRK: JOE MIXON IS DOING A NICE JOB. HE IS THE BENEFICIARY OF THE WAY THEY HAVE BEEN BLOCKING ON THE INTERIOR, AVERAGING OVER SEVEN YARDS PER CARRY. THEY HAVE MIXED UP THEIR PERSONNEL, KEEPING THIS JETS DEFENSE OFF BALANCE. AL: WE HAVE SEEN MIXON FOR HE IS LOOKING AS GOOD AS WE HAVE EVER SEEN HIM. KIRK: IT IS THE BEST HE HAS LOOKED IN SIX OR SEVEN YEARS. AL: ANOTHER BAD SIGN FOR THE NYJ. KIRK: A BIG PART OF THIS DEFENSIVE FRONT IS THE DEPTH THEY HAVE TYPICALLY HAD OVER THE YEARS AND ROTATING. THEY ARE SO VIOLENT, SO AGGRESSIVE. THEY MIGHT NEED HIM TO GET SOME DEPTH ON THE DEFENSIVE FRONT. THEY PLAY SO HARD THAT THEY ROTATE EIGHT OR NINE GUYS. AL: GOD FOR BID. KIRK: [LAUGHTER] AL: FIRST DOWN. HE FINALLY GIVES STUFFED BEFORE HE CAN TURN THE CORNER. KIRK: THE CORNERS IN THIS STYLE OF DEFENSE, A LOT OF TIMES THEY WILL SET THE TONE WITH A WILLINGNESS TO TACKLE. ECHOLS, HE HAS TO BE ABLE TO STEP UP AND MAKE A PLAY FOR REED. IT LOOKS LIKE ROBERT WOODS WAS MIXED UP FOR WHO TO BLOCK BUT AT LEAST THERE WAS A WILLINGNESS FROM THE CORNER TO COME UP AND MAKE A PLAY. AL: THE JETS FINALLY GET THERE TWO STARTING CORNERS BACK. FINALLY A LOT OF TIME FOR STROUD BUT THE SECONDARY DOES ITS WORK. HE WILL TAKE OFF AND HE WILL GET THE FIRST DOWN AT THE 14-YARD ON SECOND AND FOR THE FIRST. KIRK: AGAIN, LET'S WATCH THE HE WILL PULL AND LEAD AND TRY TO HELP OUT. TAKES ON REDDICK. NOW YOU HAVE C.J. STROUD. THIS IS AN AREA C.J. STROUD REALLY GREW DURING HIS TIME AT OHIO STATE. IN THE SEMI FINAL GAME AGAINST GEORGIA, HE SHOWED WHAT DO OUTSIDE THE POCKET. AL: INSIDE FIVE MINUTES IN THE HALF. MIXON GETS STUFFED IN THE BACKFIELD AND SLOWED DOWN BY LEONARD TAYLOR. THE JETS RIGHT NOW WERE ALREADY MINUS ADAMS, DAVIS, C.J. MOSLEY. TONIGHT, D.J. REED AND SAUCE GARDNER BOTH GOT HURT BUT THEY ARE BACK IN. KIRK: BOBBY SLOWIK, THE OFFENSE OF COORDINATOR, HAS TRIED TO MATCH WITS WITH JEFF ULBRICH. HE HAS BEEN CHANGING LOOKS. SOMETIMES HE HAS ONE TIGHT END, SOMETIMES TWO. 11 PERSONNEL, SOMETIMES 12. TWO TIGHT ENDS IS WHAT HE HAS RIGHT NOW. AL: THERE HE WAS OUT OF THE SLOT. HE HAS TO FLING IT AWAY AS HE WAS UNDER PRESSURE. JAVON KINLAW CHASED HIM OUT. 4:04 TO GO, IT IS THIRD AND 12. THE GAME REMAINS FOR THIS. KIRK: THAT TIME, GREAT EFFORT. WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY LIKE TO ROTATE AND STAY FRESH BECAUSE OF HOW HARD THEY PLAY. IT IS A PENETRATING FRONT THAT LIKES TO GET INTO THE BACKFIELD. THEY GET WORN OUT UP FRONT. TEXANS, THIRD AND 10-PLUS, THEY ARE THE BEST IN THE LEAGUE IN CONVERTING THESE THIRD AND LONGS. AL: THIRD AND 12. ON THE MOVE, THROWS, AND THAT IS CALLED IN, TANK DELL, FOR A NEEDED 12, PICKED UP 14. FIRST AND GOAL ON A DRIVE THAT STARTED BACK ON THEIR OWN 2-YARD KIRK: A LITTLE STUNT THAT AFFECTS COMMUNICATION. HOW ABOUT STROUD? WHAT WE LOVE ABOUT C.J. STROUD IS HIS EYES ARE DOWNFIELD WHILE HE IS RUNNING TO TRY TO BUY TIME AND THEN THE ACCURACY OF THAT THROW ON THIRD AND LONG. ONCE AGAIN, THEY CONVERT. AL: 14TH PLAY OUT THE DRIVES. THEY GIVE IT TO MIXON, GOES IN FOR THE TOUCHDOWN! IF ANYBODY EVER DESERVED A TOUCHDOWN AFTER A DRIVE LIKE THAT, IT IS THAT GUY. 15 CARRIES TONIGHT, 85 YARDS. THOMAS MORSTEAD PINS THEN AT THE 2, AND THEY GO 98 IN 14 PLAYS. KIRK: QUINCY WILLIAMS SHOT IN, TRY TO SEE IF HE COULD BLOW THAT PLAY UP. MIXON WITH THE JUMP CUT. ONCE HE GOT AROUND QUINCY WILLIAMS, THERE WAS NO ONE THERE. 98-YARD DRIVE. AL: TOOK 8:23 OFF THE CLOCK. KA'IMI FAIRBAIRN TO KICK THE EXTRA POINT. 3:21 TO GO IN THE FIRST HALF. THE HOUSTON TEXANS 7-0 ON THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL. REQUEST, HIS BARBER MOVED FROM COLUMBUS TO HOUSTON TO KEEP THE ROUTINE GOING. AND MAGGIE'S CLIENTS CAN BOOK THE CJ SPECIAL IF THEY LIKE HIS LOOK. AL: THE NEXT TIME WE ARE DOWN IN HOUSTON, WHAT DO YOU THINK? KIRK: SIGN ME UP. AL: WE DON'T LOOK GOOD, RIGHT? KIRK: THAT'S RIGHT. AL: SOMETHING LIKE THAT. KIRK: WE ALWAYS HAVE A TIGHT CUT WHEN WE COME IN ON THURSDAY. AL: THE HAIR ON MY CHEST. IN OTHER NEWS. 30 YARD LINE, THE JETS AND RODGERS GOES BACK TO WORK. KIRK: HERE WE GO, 3:21, LET'S SEE IF THE JETS CAN GET ON TH BOARD. AL: ROGERS 4-9 FOR 14 YARDS. BOTH BACKS IN THE BACK. HALL AND ALLEN. ALLEN, NUMBER ZERO. BOTH GOING TO THE PATTERN. PASS IS CAUGHT. BREAKING AWAY, PICKING UP THE SPINNING AWAY THAT TIME IS DAVANTE ADAMS TO PICK UP KIRK: GREAT JOB WHERE YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING AFTER THE PRETTY TIGHT IN THE INTERIOR. INSIDE LINEBACKER IS LOOKING RIGHT THERE, BUT HE'S ABLE TO SHAKE THREE FROM HIM. HE STILL HAS THAT ABILITY. YOU ALWAYS THINK ABOUT HIS RELEASE AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. MAKING PLAYS DOWNFIELD. THAT TIME DOING IT AFTER THE AL: THE GROUND, AND NOTHING TOTO, STOPPING REESE FALLEN HIS TRACKS. RUNNING 240. KIRK: THE GUY WE HAVE NOT SEEN YET, NOT GETTING THE OPPORTUNITY IS GARRETT WILSON. LAST WEEK HE EXPLODED FIVE CATCHES, 113 YARDS IN THE LOSS TO NEW ENGLAND. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE FELT WITH THE ATTENTION THAT ADAMS CAN CREATE, WILSON WILL GET MORE CLASS -- MORE CHANCES. IN THE FIRST HALF, JUST THE ONE TARGET, DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SCREEN. AL: THE JETS HAD THE BALL FOR A LITTLE OVER EIGHT MINUTES. THE PASS OUT HERE, SPEAKING OF HE GETS INTO THE PLAY, BUT NOTHING THERE. LASSITER MAKES THE TACKLE AND THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING. NO, TOO MANY KIRK: SHE'S NOT LOVING IT. AL: HALLOWEEN NIGHT. THE PERFECT NIGHT FOR CANDY CORN. COMING BACK WITH A THIRD AND 10 WITH THE JETS FROM THEIR OWN 42 EXTRA PRESSURE. AND ROGERS IS GOING TO GET SACKED. PUT THE HEAT ON AND DOWN HE GOES. IT LOOKED LIKE HUNTER WAS THE FIRST GUIDE TO GET THERE. 32ND TIMEOUT IS TAKEN HERE BY NEW YORK. KIRK: WHAT AN ADDITION DANIEL HUNTER HAS BEEN. BOTH OF THESE GUYS. NOW THAT HE'S BACK. LOOK AT THAT WIDE STANCE BY HUNTER. USUALLY ANDERSON IS ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT HE GETS ABLE TO GET AROUND TYRON SMITH AND IT MAKES HIM STEP UP. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN MORE FROM AARON RODGERS IN RECENT WEEKS. THE PRESSURE GETS TO HIM AND HE DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRY TO FIGHT TO GET OUT OF THERE. THIS DEFENSIVE LINE REALLY DIALING UP THAT PRESSURE AND WINNING THE BATTLE UP FRONT. AUTRY, TWO SACKS TONIGHT. AL: TIMEOUT TAKEN BY HOUSTON. SO THEY HAVE A TON OF TIME. THEY STILL HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS. JETS ARE GOING TO GET THE BALL TO START THE SECOND HALF. HERE'S MORE SAID, WHOSE LAST PUNT WAS 75 YARDS. PINNED HIM INTO TWO BUT THE TEXAS TOOK IT 98. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IN THE GAME RIGHT NOW. SHORT, FLOATING KICK. 29 YARD LINE BY STEVEN SIMS. AL: SHROUD SIX OUT OF 13 FOR 84 NIXON'S BEEN THE BIG MAN YOU'VE GOT BLAKE FISHER IN THEIR. ROOKIE OUT OF NOTRE DAME UP FRONT. PUTTING IT UP FROM THE 32 YARD LINE SECOND DOWN. KIRK: HARD RUN GOES RIGHT THROUGH ISAIAH OLIVER. NEAR THE END OF THIS RUN. WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT HIM. THAT RIGHT SHOULDER WENT RIGHT TO HIS FACEMASK. STEFON DIGGS DOWN, YOU WONDER WHO NOT JUST TONIGHT, MINUTE 20 TO GO, CAN STROUD FIND TIMING WITH THESE OTHER AL: MIX AND AGAIN. DESPITE THAT ANKLE INJURY CROSSING HIM THREE GAMES PUSH PART OF ANOTHER, HE'S ON PART OF A PACE TO RUN FOR OVER 1400 CART -- 1400 YARDS THIS SEASON. KIRK: INTERESTING DECISION. IT'S LIKE NOW HE'S GOING A LITTLE BIT FASTER. AL: SAVING THE TWO TIMEOUTS PART OF THE 50. DOWN THE SIDELINE, OUT OF BOUNDS STOPPING THE CLOCK WITH 43 SECONDS, SO HE GETS FREE. MIXON THREW A NICE BLOCK TO 34 KIRK: WITH HIM COMING FROM THE LEFT SIDE, HE GETS CAUGHT IN THE TRAFFIC. NO ONE HERE TO PICK HIM UP AND MAN COVERAGE. THERE'S THE SPEED HE SHOWED LAST YEAR AS A ROOKIE AFTER THE REMEMBER HE BROKE HIS LEG AND WEEK 13 ONE YEAR AGO, HASN'T QUITE BEEN THE SAME GUY BUT NOW WITH MORE OPPORTUNITIES. EVERYONE IS STILL VERY HOPEFUL HE COULD BECOME THE RECEIVER THAT HE HAD LAST YEAR WHEN HE WAS MAKING PLAYS DOWNFIELD. AL: MIXON PUSHING THE DEFENDER OUT OF THE WAY, FOR HIM. HE'S GOING TO THE END ZONE. ANOTHER CONTACT. FIRST TIME HE IS BEEN TARGETED SECOND AND 10. KIRK: MUCH BETTER COVERAGE STAYED ON TOP. PUTS 95 IN THE MIDDLE. DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB. HE'S PLAYING WITH SUCH DIFFERENT EFFORT AND NOT GETTING TOO LOW THEY PROTECT THE QUARTERBACK AFTER THE THROW. AL: SHROUD, INCOMPLETE. THE INTENDED RECEIVER, 33 TICKS, KIRK: JETS WOULD MAN COVERAGE AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THE DRIVER GOT STARTED. WHO CAN WIN AGAINST THAT MAN COVERAGE. WE SAW HIM ON THAT ROUTE WHERE HE WAS ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THAT TRAFFIC TO SPRING FREE, BUT THESE LAST FEW PLAYS, GOOD COVERAGE BY THE JETS AGAINST THESE RECEIVERS. AL: LONG TIME ASSISTANT COACH, MIKE SHANAHAN FOR A NUMBER OF THIRD DOWN AND 10. HANGING IN THE POCKET. DOWN HE GOES, A BIG SACK, TAKING DEEPER INTO THE FIELD GOAL TERRITORY. MEANWHILE, NOW YOU'VE GOT STROUD'S DOWN WITH 26 SECONDS OH BABY. KIRK: WITH THE EDGE PRESSURE WITH REDDICK AND MCDONNELL, IT MAKES THEIR QUARTERBACK WANT TO STEP UP. IF YOU GET A PUSH IN THE MIDDLE FROM THOMAS, THAT'S HOW YOU GET SACKS IN THE INTERIOR WITH THAT >> THIS OCCURRED BEFORE THE TIMEOUT. PLEASE RESET THE GAME CLOCK TO 37 SECONDS. AL: THE CLOCK GOES TO 27. THE BACKUP QUARTERBACK WOULD BE DAVIS MILLS. KIRK: I TALKED TO CJ ON THE FIELD, HOW YOU FEELING, SHORT WEEK. KIND OF BANGED UP RIGHT NOW AND HE'S FIGHTING LIKE A LOT OF GUYS. THEY CAPABLE BACK UP WITH A STARTER A COUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE CJ WAS DRAFTED. JUST GOOD TO SEE HIM UP AND WALKING OFF. AL: TAKING THE HALFTIME BREAK TO GET WHATEVER TREATMENT IS THERE. MEANWHILE, FAIRBAIRN IS GOING INTO THE GAME. THAT'S A 15 YARD PENALTY IF THEY WOULD'VE CAUGHT THAT. BUT THEY DIDN'T, SO INSTEAD NOW YOU' YOU'VE GOT A 56 YARD FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT FOR FAIRBAIRN NINE FOR 10 THIS SEASON. IN HIS RANGE. THE DISTANCE BUT NOT THE ACCURACY. JETS WILL TAKE WHATEVER BREAK THEY CAN GET. KIRK: THE OPERATION IS CLEAN, GOOD SNAP. HE JUST PUSHES IT HOW YOU SAID, HE HAD THE DISTANCE. AARON RODGERS AND HIS ENTIRE CAREER, THE FEWEST YARDS IN THE FIRST HALF. WHERE HE' WHERE HE'S ATTEMPTED AT LEAST 10 PASSES. 27 YARDS PASSING. PREVIOUS LOW WAS 37. AL: 12 OF THEM ON ONE PASS TO SO NOW THE JETS, ROGERS, HE'S CAPABLE, OBVIOUSLY THE KING OF THE HAIL MARY, WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO HERE, TRIES TO GET A LITTLE CLOSER, HE WILL STOP THE CLOCK AND IT GETS ADAMS THERE. EVERYTHING HAS BEEN PRETTY SHORT KIRK: THEY HAD FIELD GOAL KICKING ISSUES, OBVIOUSLY WHAT'S WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN RECENT WEEKS. AL: THEY CERTAINLY DO. NOW YOU HAVE PATTERSON WHO WAS JUST SIGNED. HE'S BEEN AROUND. JOURNEYMAN TICKER. HE'S HURT AND PATTERSON, FOURTH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE, TRADE A COUPLE OF TIMES. JACKSONVILLE, CLEVELAND. SEE IF HE GETS A SHOT. THAT IS GOING TO NOT HOLD IN. ADAMS WAS THERE, HAD TO REACH DOWN FOR IT. COVERING ON THE PLAY. ROGERS LOOKS AT THE HEAVENS DURING THE BY. KIRK: WHAT A MATCH UP WITH BALLS THERE, JUST UNABLE TO HOLD ONTO IT. GETS BOTH HANDS ON IT. IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S A SHORT CATCH FOR A GUY LIKE DAVANTE PUT THEM IN GREAT FIELD GOAL RANGE AT THE VERY LEAST. BUT, IN INCOMPLETION. AL: HE'S PROBABLY THINKING I'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO PERU. THIRD AND FIVE. IN THAT'S BROKEN UP. IT ADAMS, THE INTENDED RECEIVER AGAIN, BROKEN UP HERE, 12 KIRK: IT SHOWS YOU THE CONFIDENCE DEMECO RYANS HAS WITH THE CORNERS. HE PUTS THEM OUT THERE ON IOWANS. BELIEVE HE CAN WIN THAT ONE ON ONE MATCH UP. ADAMS WON THE LAST ONE. WATCH THAT. GREAT RECOGNITION, BALLS OUT IN THAT RIGHT ARM COMES DOWN TO KNOCK THAT BALL AWAY. AL: JETS CAN'T TAKE A CHANCE ON GOING FOR IT BECAUSE ON FOURTH DOWN THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT, ONE PASS IN TEXAS MIGHT BE IN FIELD SHAPE AGAIN. SO MOORE SAID COMES INTO NT. PUNT NUMBER FIVE FOR HIM. WE'VE GOT A FLAG. NO BIG DEAL HERE WITH THE BALL TO MIDFIELD. THE INTERIM COACH, AGAIN, IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE HE WAS THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR AND INSTEAD OF HANDING OFF THAT ROLE, HE'S TRYING TO DO TWO THINGS AT ONCE, HIS FIRST HEAD COACHING OPPORTUNITY. MIDDLE OF THE SEASON IS TOUGH. SO FOURTH DOWN. ONE IN TO THE END ZONE WITH FIVE SECONDS LEFT. A NONPARTISAN INITIATIVE THAT SUPPORTS CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AMONG NFL FAMILIES. FOR MORE INFORMATION, MAKE YOUR GAME PLAN FOR THE UPCOMING ELECTION, PLEASE VISIT INTEL.COM/VOTES. VOTE FOR THE M.V.P. OF THIS GAME, THERE HE IS, JOE MIXON. MEANWHILE, SHROUD IS BACK. THAT'S REALLY GOOD NEWS. HE WILL TAKE JUST A KNEE. A VERY FAMILIAR SOUND IN THE MEADOWLANDS BOTH FOR THE JETS AND THE GIANTS. KAYLEE, TO YOU. >>ES, 100 OR MORE RUSHING YARDS IN THE FIRST HALF, THANK YOU JOE MIXON. AND FOR AARON RODGERS, SEVEN OUT OF 14 32 YARDS. NO TRUTH TO THE RUMORS THAT IN THE JETS LOCKER ROOM AT HALFTIME THEY WERE PLAYING HELLO DARKNESS MY OLD FRIEND. FAKE NEWS. KIRK: THAT WAS A TOUGH HALF. AL: VERY. KIRK: IT'S GOING TO GET A LOT BETTER HERE. A BETTER EXECUTION. AL: PROMISE? AL: JETS START AT THE 30 AND WE GO TO KAYLEE. >> YOUR OFFENSE IF STRUGGLES CONTINUE, WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO GET IT ON THE BOARD? >> WEATHER PENALTIES, EXECUTIONS, YOU HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP AND WE WILL GET AFTER THESE KAYLEE: A MENTAL MISTAKE BY MALACHI ON THE COLTS -- GOAL LINE, HOW IS THAT A AT HALFTIME? >> HE WILL LEARN FROM THAT AND GROW FROM THAT AND I HAVE A FEELING HE WILL MAKE UP FOR A. AL: THANK YOU, KAYLEE. HE DROPPED IT BEFORE HE WENT INTO THE END ZONE. START WITH REESE, UP TO THE 35. SECOND DOWN AND FIVE. KIRK: HIS ANSWER GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF WHY AARON RODGERS ON THESE JETS PLAYERS ARE IN AN AWKWARD, WEIRD SITUATION WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR HEAD COACH EARLY IN THE YEAR, THEY SAID HE HAS BEEN A ROCK. WE LIKE HIM. HE HAS DONE THE BEST THAT HE CAN UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT EVEN THAT ANSWER, HE WILL MAKE UP FOR IT IN THE SECOND HALF. TRYING TO FIND POSITIVITY, WHICH IS TOUGH TO DO. AL: COMING UP CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN HERE. IN A MARKET JUST SHY THIRD DOWN. KIRK: IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT THE OFFENSE OF STAFF DOES TRYING TO GET THIS UP AND GOING, RODGERS BEING ABLE TO RUN THE BALL IN THE YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO WIN DOWNFIELD. AL: ALLEN, UP TO THE 43. SELDOMLY USED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF GAMES. KIRK: REALLY A GOOD EFFORT, IT LOOK LIKE IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE. FAST FLOWING DEFENSE TO GO OUT ON THE EDGE AND SOLVE IT, THEY WERE ABLE TO CUT IT BACK AND GET POSITIVE YARDS. THEY WERE ON THE GROUND TO START THINGS OFF. THEY GO TO THE BOTTOM. AL: ALLEN, A NICE AND A ONE-TWO PUNCH, BUT IT'S BEEN TAKING OVER MOST OF THE DUTIES OF LATE. KIRK: KIRK: HE HAS A HANDFUL -- KIRK: HE IS A HANDFUL. WE TALKED ABOUT IT WEEK THREE, I WATCHED THEM PLAY QUITE A BIT JUST QUITE A BIT -- QUITE A BIT. AS YOU SAY, NICE TANDEM, VERY DIFFERENT STYLE WITH HIM AT HOME. AL: 20 YEARS OLD, YOUNGEST PLAYER IN THE NFL RIGHT NOW. SECOND DOWN AND 5. QUICK TOSS HERE. THE OUTSIDE. HE SWINGS THEM OUT OF BOUNDS. NO FLAG ON THE PLAY AFTER THAT. KIRK: THEY RUN IT FOUR STRAIGHT TIMES. THIS IS ANOTHER RUN. HE'S GOT A QUICK THROW OUT YOU GOT THE BLOCK AROUND IN FRONT, YOU TAKE IT. AN EASY JOB TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP FIRST DOWN YARDAGE. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU SEEN THEM DO THAT WITH THE CORNER. HAS THAT TAG ON THE RUN, BEEN ABLE TO FLIP IT OUT THERE. AL: BACK TO BACK, THEY HAVE ONLY SEVEN IN THE GAME. EXTRA MAN COMES, ROGERS MOVING. ROGERS HIT PRETTY HIGH. AARON PASSED SECOND DOWN AND 10. KIRK: AARON RODGERS EARLY IN THE AIR WAS MOVING AROUND PRETTY WELL COMING OFF THAT ACHILLES. HE HAS NOT MOVED AROUND AS MUCH. THAT' THAT'S SCARY ANY TIME LET ALONE YOUR COMING OFF AN ACHILLES INJURY THAT HE HAD ONE YEAR AGO. AL: BRACE HIMSELF. THE 45. PLAY FAKE, ADAMS, AND ADAMS GOES THIS WAY FOR A FIRST DOWN. BACK TO BACK TO BACK FIRST DOWN FOR THE JETS TO START THE SECOND KIRK: A GREAT JOB BY AARON RODGERS, SENSING AND FEELING. HE' HE'S GOT A RUN PLAY HERE. BUT SEE THAT PLAY, FLIPS IT OUT THERE BECAUSE THE SAFETY IS SO DEEP SO THE ROOKIE WAS BACK, SEES HIS BLITZ AND SAYS, WE ARE NOT GOING TO RUN THIS. FLIPPING OUT TO ADAMS. SECOND TIME HE HAS DONE THAT. REALLY GOOD COMBINATION, RUNNING THE FOOTBALL, BEING PATIENT AND ROGERS RECOGNIZES THE PASS. AL: CLOSES IN A HURRY, 25 YARD WE GO TO KAYLEE. KAYLEE: THE JETS START MAKING HEADWAY ON OFFENSE WITHOUT DEFENSIVE END WEILL ANDERSON. RESOLVE TO THE FIRST HALF TRYING TO FIGHT THROUGH AN ANKLE INJURY BUT HE HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED TO QUESTIONABLE. WHEN THE TEXANS OFFENSE GETS BACK ON THE FIELD, THEY WILL NOT HAVE LEFT GUARD, HE HAS BEEN RULED OUT. AL: ANDERSON HAS BEEN IN AND OUT SINCE HE WENT INTO THE BLUE OUT RIGHT NOW, SECOND DOWN AND THREE. ROGERS THROWS, IT IN THE TRAFFIC CAUGHT. THAT'S A FIRST DOWN. MIKE WILLIAMS HAS HAD A LOT OF GOOD YEARS WITH THE CHARGERS, COMES OVER AND HASN'T DONE MUCH PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN. KIRK: THAT WAS A TIGHT WINDOW AND HE MAKES AN ACCURATE THROW TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE WITH THE LINEBACKERS. IT' IT'S THE 10TH PLAY THIS DRIVE. GRAPE PATIENT SO FAR BY ROGERS AND THE JETS. AL: FIVE RUNS, FOUR PASSES. GOOD TACKLE RIGHT IN THE BACK. RESOLVE TAKING DOWN TIM, COMES DIVING INTO STOP HIM. SECOND DOWN AND 12 AFTER A LOSS OF TWO YARDS. KIRK: WHAT A YEAR HE HAS HAD COMING FROM BUFFALO, NOT ONLY THE ABILITY TO BUY INTO THE SYSTEM AND SACKS. GOT FOUR INTO TONIGHT PUT A LOT OF ABILITY TO MAKE PLAYS LIKE THAT. GETTING THAT DEFENSE IS PREDICATED UPON. THAT DEFENSE OF LINE IS GETTING UPFIELD, BEING DISRUPTIVE. YOU SEE 96 AUTRY WHO COULD PLAY INSIDE BUT WITH THE INTEREST -- INJURY, ANDERSON IS PUSHED OUTSIDE. AL: SECOND AND 12, WHAT -- ROGERS UNDER PRESSURE, ONE-HANDED CAUGHT. WILSON, TOUCHDOWN! NOBODY THERE. GOOD BALL PLACEMENT. AL: RILEY PASSES FIRST KICK AS A JET. AL: FROM THE TWO YARD LINE, STEVEN SIMS. 29 AND A PENALTY. >> DURING THE RETURN, PERSONAL FOUL, FACEMASK BY THE KICKING TEAM NUMBER 88. IT'S FIRST DOWN. AL: WE TALKED ABOUT THE JETS PLENTY TONIGHT. THEY FINALLY GOT IT RIGHT, HE WAS THERE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THEN HE TOOK OVER THE MIDDLE OF THE SEASON. THEY HAD LOVIE SMITH. I THINK THEY REALLY GOT IT RIGHT. KIRK: I THINK HE RELATES TO THE PLAYERS IN A WAY THAT VERY FEW GUYS CAN. LOOK AT WHAT HE DID AS A PLAYER. HE HAS RESPECT THERE. HE PAID HIS DUES AND BECAME A COORDINATOR. HE HAS AN INFECTIOUS ATTITUDE AND ENERGY ABOUT HIM. AL: SHROUD. LET'S TAKE IT UP AT THE END OF WITH RYAN'S, HE WAS WITH THE TEXANS, SO HE KNOWS THE ORGANIZATION. HE GOES TO PHILADELPHIA AND SAYS, HIS FIRST YEAR IN PHILLY WAS AND HE READS. TOOK A LOT OF WIN FOR ANDY REID WHILE HE'S AROUND THE FOOTBALL TEAM. KIRK: AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO GO OUT OBVIOUSLY WITH SAN FRANCISCO AND WATCH AND LEARN FROM SOME OF THE BEST AND THEN HE GETS HIS I THINK WHEN HE HAS DONE A THAT'S WHAT HE HAS DONE A NICE JOB OF IT AS HE HAS TAKEN ALL OF THAT AND HE HAS BEEN TRUE TO HIMSELF AND WHO HE IS. THE FIRST YEAR HE CHANGE THAT CULTURE IN HOUSTON AND GOT SOME YOUNG PLAYERS. THEY ARE A TEAM ON THE GO RIGHT NOW. AL: CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN GOES JOE MIXON. BACK OVER THE KAYLEE. KAYLEE: YOU WON'T FIND ANYBODY DOZING OFF IN A D'AMICO RYAN LEAD MEETING. HE TOLD ME HE'S SO ENERGETIC HE'S GOT A PARTY SCREAMING ALL NIGHT. AL: YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT IF YOU TALK TO HIM AWAY FROM THAT ENVIRONMENT. SHROUD RUNS FOR A FIRST DOWN. KIRK: MAN-TO-MAN COVERAGE, NOT EXPECTING C.J. STROUD TO HOLD ONTO THAT BALL AND SHORT YARDAGE. GOOD CALL TO GET HIM OUT ON THE EDGE. NOBODY ACCOUNTS FOR HIM. TODD TOWNIE -- TODD DOWNING THEY ARE EXPECTING JOE MIXON TO RUN INTO THE MIDDLE. THAT'S FOR ALL THE DEFENDERS WERE. YOU COULD SEE SHERWOOD HAS HIS BACK TURNED. NOBODY HAS EXPECTED SHROUD TO RUN. GOOD CALL UTILIZING HIS LEGS. AL: JJ IS NOW A RUNNING BACK. FOR A COUPLE OF PLACE TONIGHT. YOU CALL THIS NUMBER AND THEN HE TRIPS AND FALLS. MIGHT'VE PICKED UP A FEW MORE, MIGHT'VE HAD A FEW, HE GOES THANKS TO THE TURP. KIRK: THE JOB THAT KENDRICK GREEN HAS DONE, WHO HAS REALLY STRUGGLED IN THE FIRST HALF, 53 HOLDING HIS OWN. DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB. WHETHER IT' WHETHER IT'S BEEN RUN OR PASS, MOVING THEM AROUND QUITE A BIT AS WELL, BUT THAT OFFENSE OF LINE AND THAT FIRST HALF, THEY WERE VERY -- DEALING WITH A LOT OF AGGRESSIVE APPROACH BY THE JETS. THE JETS WERE VERY DISRUPTIVE BUT THEY DID SLOW DOWN A BIT WITH 53 DOWN ON THE LEFT SIDE. AL: SECOND AND 1. GIVE IT TO TAYLOR AGAIN. HE PICKS UP A FIRST DOWN ON THE 24 YARD LINE. GOOD OPENING DRIVES. NOTHING MAJOR. GOOD OPENING DRIVES FOR BOTH TEAMS. KIRK: RIGHT ON CUE 53 GREEN WITH THE BLOCK. LOOKING FOR A LITTLE EXTRA EFFORT 10 YARDS DOWNFIELD. PRETTY GOOD ANSWER BY HOUSTON AFTER THAT IMPRESSIVE OPENING DRIVE BY THE JETS. COMING RIGHT BACK DOWN DEEP INTO THE JETS TERRITORY. AL: ON THIS THEY HAVE ALL BEEN RUNS. MIX IN APPROACHING 100 YARDS. PLAY-ACTION, PASS, NOT HOLDING. HE COULD NOT HAUL IT IN. MAKES IT SECOND DOWN AND 10. SHROUD IS SEVEN FOR 17 AND 15 KIRK: HE'S REALLY FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THAT WAS A FIRST AND 10 REACTION. THEY BOOTED HIM BACK TO THE HE ACTUALLY HAD AN OPEN HE DID A NICE JOB OF MAKING A QUICK READ. GETS IT OUT OF HIS HAND. THAT'S A BALL ACTIVITY SHROUD HAS SHOWN CONSISTENTLY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT THROW. THAT'S BIG YARDS ON FIRST AND 10 , IF THEY HAD THAT ONE. AL: STUFFED IN THE BACKFIELD, NO GAIN. JAVON KINLAW ON, SEVERAL SEASONS WITH THE -- KIRK: HE'S PLAYING A LOT BETTER THAN HE HAS RECENTLY WHERE HE HAS HAD SOME STRUGGLES WHERE HE GETS UP HIGH AGAINST THE RUN AND HE GETS PUSHED OFF THE LINE OF TONIGHT, HE MUST LIKE THE MATCHUP BECAUSE HE IS MOVING AROUND MUCH BETTER. HE SHOOTING THE GAPS AGAINST HIS OFFENSIVE LINE AND GETTING INTO THAT BACKFIELD, WHETHER IT'S BEEN A PASS RUSHER A PASS RUSHER GETS THE RUN. AL: WHEN HE'S IN THE BACKFIELD UP THIRD AND 11. HE STAYS IN THE BLOCK. THERE HE GOES. YOU HAD MCDONNELL COMING IN FIRST AND THEN SHERWOOD FINISHES HIM OFF. THAT'S A SACK OF 11 YARDS FROM MCDONALD WHO'S HAD SUCH A BIG YEAR COMING IN A SACKS ON THE YEAR, HE WORKS AROUND TONSIL WITH QUICKNESS. I THOUGHT HE WOULD PULL HIM DOWN WITH ONE ARM, BUT INSTEAD HE FORCED HIM TO STEP UP. THERE SHERWOOD THAT JUST CLEANED SET UP AT THE END. AL: YOU WILL COME IN. HE MISSED A 56 YARDER EARLIER, HAD THE DISTANCE, BUT IT WAS WIDE. THIS WAS 54 OUT. ON ITS WAY, AND THROUGH. AL: NO QUESTION. THE GIANTS AND FOR HOME GAMES THIS YEAR, WHEN TOUCHDOWN. KIRK: IT WAS A TOUGH FIRST HALF OF THE JETS OFFENSE. THEY RESPONDED PERFECTLY WITH THE ADJUSTMENTS. THINGS LOOKED A LOT BETTER BUT IT CANNOT HAVE GONE ANY WORSE. EVEN WHEN THEY PLAY WELL, THE DEFENSE WITH THE CHANCE TO STOP ON A PUNT, THERE'S THE POMMEL FOR T END ZONE WITH A TOUCH DROP PASSES. JUST OUT OF SYNC. WHEN THEY HAD OVER RECEIVERS DROP ALSO, A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING. MUCH OF WHAT YOU SEEN THE FIRST EIGHT WEEKS OF THE SEASON, BUT THE OUTSTANDING START TO THE SECOND HALF OF THE PATIENT APPROACH, AARON RODGERS RUN GAME MIXED IN WITH SOME QUICK THROWS. AL: THIS ONE, PLAY-ACTION, ROLLING, THROWING. INTENDED. THIS HAS BEEN A HOUSE OF HORRORS. DON'T FORGET, HOPE -- GHOSTS HAVE APPEARED HERE. SAM ARNOLD SAW SOME IN THAT PACE AGAINST THE PATRIOTS. KIRK: I'VE BEEN IN A BOOTH ON HALLOWEEN. I'M LOOKING AROUND. AL: YOU NEVER KNOW. YOU DON'T USE, THESE ARE JEWS. A TACKLE, AND ANOTHER. IN PICKS UP A FIRST DOWN. AND HE THINKS HE WAS NOT BROUGHT THE ROLE ON TOP OF A DEFENDER AND KEEPS ON GOING. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. KIRK: EARLIER, HE DID THIS EXACT SAME THING WHERE HE HAS HIS EYES ON HALL. HE KNOWS HE'S A DANGEROUS HE'S THERE TO MAKE THE PLAY. HE BOUNCES OFF OF RESOLVE. AL: THE REPLAY ASSIST SAID HE WAS DOWN. ORIGINALLY THEY WERE GOING TO PUT THEM UP AT THE 49. THERE HE WAS. KIRK: THINK OF BRAELON ALLEN BEING THE FISCAL BACK BUT RESOLVE BEING A 200 17 POUNDS, HE JUST BOUNCED OFF TO ATTILA. AL: 13 YARD GAIN, TO THE TAKEN DOWN AT THE 48. WITH THE LINEBACKER MAKING THE TACKLE. IT ONLY DOWN TO THREE MINUTES REMAINING IN THE THIRD QUARTER. THE -- KIRK: THE JETS HAVE HAD SOME INJURIES ON THE OFFENSIVE YOU HAD FOUR TACKLES IN THE GAME MAX MITCHELL IS IN RIGHT NOW PLAYING IT. HE'S A RIGHT TACKLE PLAYING LEFT GUARD IN THE ROOKIE IS PLAYING ALSO UP THERE IN THE RIGHT GUARD SPOT. ROTATING AND PLAYING WITH FOUR TACKLES OUT OF THE FIVE SPOTS. AL: TO THE 50, SETTING UP A THIRD DOWN. BRAELON ALLEN, THIRD AND THREE. TWO AND A HALF LEFT IN THE HOUSTON UP BY THREE. KIRK: WHEN YOU MAKE A MOVE LIKE THAT IT'S GREAT TO HAVE PLAYERS THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO MOVE FROM OUTSIDE TO INSIDE, BUT THAT CHALLENGES YOU WANT TO SHORT WE, THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE DEFENSE THAT CAN MOVE AROUND, IT'S TRYING TO PENETRATE. THE CALL IS UP FRONT. BEING ON THE SAME PAGE, THE CONTINUITY WILL BE TESTED FOR THE JETS ON THE LINE. AL: MOMENTARY STOPPAGE, THEY WILL ROLL THE CLOCK. 10 ON THE PLAY CLOCK. SNAP IT AT ONE. THAT'S A NICE GROUT THAT TIME, WILSON ABLE TO REACH FOR IT. HE STOPPED SHY FOR THE FIRST TIME BY PETRIE. FOURTH DOWN. THE CROWD WANTS HIM TO GO FOR ROGERS WILL WANT THEM TO GO FOR KIRK: EVERYONE IS EXCITED. IF YOU GET STOPPED, YOU GET BOOED OFF THE FIELD AND TEXANS GET GREAT FIELD POSITION. AL: OF COURSE, THAT' AL: OF COURSE, THAT'S HOW IT WORKS. ALAN IS IN THE BACKFIELD. TRYING TO GET A FREE FIRST DOWN. THAT TEXAN LINE TRYING TO HOLD ITS GROUND, AND THEY DO. ROGERS WILL THROW IN OPENS. FIRST DOWN AND A LOT MORE AS DAVANTE ADAMS GETS FREE. NOW HE IS DOWN. KIRK:CTATIONS AND TAKES HIS SHAR OF THE HEAT. A TEAM THAT HAS NOT BEEN TO THE PLAYOFFS AND 13 YEARS. FINAL MINUTE OF THE QUARTER. RODGERS THROWS. BUSTED UP AT THE LINES. KIRK: WE DO NOT KNOW IF THAT WAS GOING TO BE FOURTH DOWN AND SHORT, IF HE WAS GOING TO GO FOR IT OR NOT. SIGNALING TO ADAMS WITH A THUMBS RODGERS SO OFTEN GIVES THOSE HAND SIGNALS, ESPECIALLY TO A VETERAN RECEIVER. WHAT A MOVE BY DAVANTE ADAMS. IT IS A PRIME MOVE HE MAKES AGAINST THAT YOUNG CORNER. AND THAT IS WHAT I THINK WHAT JETS FANS ARE EXPECTING TO SEE A LOT OF, WHEN DAVANTE ADAMS CAME OVER FROM THE RAIDERS. AL: 699 ON 10 TARGETS. TO THE NEAR SIDE. STOPPING AND MAKING THE GRAB THERE WAS WILSON. HE HAD TO SLOW DOWN AND MAKE THE BACK TO KAYLEE WE GO. >> DAVANTE ADAMS' EXTREMITIES SEEM TO BE FINE. WHEN HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE SIDELINE, A STAFFER ASKED FOR HIS HELMET, AND HE'S WITH THEM AND ECOLOGIST AS A TOOK A LOOK AT THE MONITORS. AL: THIRD AND 1. BREAKS A TACKLE ON THE BACKFIELD AND THEN GETS STOPPED SHORT OF THE LINE AND THAT IS GOING TO TAKE US TO THE FOURTH AND AL: FOURTH QUARTER, AL MICHAELS, KIRK, AND KAYLEE WITH YOU. VERY INTERESTING DECISION HERE. MEANWHILE, THERE IS ADAMS, WHO IS IN THE BLUE TECH. THERE IS ANDERSON. HE HAS BEEN IN AND OUT, BUT MAINLY OUT. YOU CAN TIE THE GAME WITH A 40 YARD FIELD GOAL OR GO FOR IT AT FOURTH DOWN AND 1. BRAELON ALLEN IS THE BACK. RODGERS COMES UP IN THE PISTOL. RETREATS, SURVEYS, UNDER PRESSURE, NEARLY GET SACKED. PUSHING PAST, IT COULD HAVE BEEN INTERCEPTED BUT WAS NOT. THE FLAG IS THROWN. THERE IS A FLAG DOWN AT THE 15 SHAWN HOCHULI GETTING HIS CUE FROM THE OTHER OFFICIALS. RODGERS WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON. OBVIOUSLY. >> QUARTERBACK LEFT THE POCKET. ILLEGAL CONTACT. AL: WOW, SO INSTEAD OF TURNING IT OVER ON DOWNS, THEY CALL SINGLY. KIRK: HE'S UP AGAINST WILLIAMS, THE VETERAN PRESS MAN COVERAGE, HANDS, HANDS, HANDS, JUST GRABBING. AL: YOU HEARD HIM SAY BEFORE HE LEFT THE POCKET. WELL, WE HAVE SEEN WORSE, HEAVENLY? KIRK: YES. FROM THE 17 YARD LINE. ON FIRST DOWN. THROWING, THROWING, AND CAUGHT AT THE THIRD YARD LINE IS JEREMY RUCKER. MEANWHILE, A DEVANTE UPDATE. KAYLEE: THE JETS CONFIRMED THAT DAVANTE ADAMS IS BEING EVALUATED FOR A CONCUSSION IN THE LOCKER ROOM. AL: WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE SHOULDER. DOWN HE WENT. MEANTIME, HERE COMES THE 11TH PLAY OF THIS DRIVE. THE LAST DRIVE WENT 11 PLAYS AND RESULTED IN A TOUCHDOWN. SO SECOND DOWN AND SIX. WILSON TO THE LEFT. THEY GO THAT WAY, AND THE TACKLE IS MADE THAT WAY. BEAUTIFULLY RED, TAKEN DOWN, AND CONKLIN IS TAKEN DOWN. AND NOW YOU HAVE GOT ANOTHER INJURED TEXAN HERE. >> TIMEOUT FOR INJURY. AL: AND APPEARS TO BE PETRI IN ON THE PLAY. THERE HE IS. KIRK: MIKE WILLIAMS HERE, YOU HAVE TWO GUYS GOING OUT TO BLOCK ONE. NOBODY PICKS UP PETRI, AND THE RESULT IS A LOSS. AL: AND A LITTLE BIT OF FRIENDLY FIRE AT THE END. HERE COMES -- KIRK: TAKE A PEEK ONE MORE TIME, IT IS SUCH A BIG CALL. YOU HAVE FIVE YARDS, FOURTH AND1 , WHERE SINGLY CAN WORK HIM. AND AT THIS POINT, HE CAN TOUCH HIM, BUT THAT IS JUST A GRAY AREA. THAT CALL AND GO ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, BUT IT GOES IN FAVOR OF I THOUGHT HE LET GO AFTER THAT FIVE YARD MARK. AL: THEY SAW IT THE OTHER WAY, AND NOW YOU HAVE AFTER THE INJURY TIMEOUT AT THIRD AND 9, A LITTLE OVER ONE MINUTE INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER. TEXANS ARE UP BY THREE. KIRK: ADAMS IS IN THE LOCKER ROOM, BEING LOOKED AT. AL: SO THEY SENT EVERYBODY OUT HERE. FIVE WIDE. KIRK: THERE IS GARRETT WILSON. AL: RODGERS LOOKED THAT WAY. OVER THE MIDDLE, AND NOW HE'S GOING TO TAKE OFF, AND HE'S GOING TO GET THE FIRST DOWN. FLAG DOWN. HE IS AT THE THREE. THERE IS A FLAG DOWN BACK AT THE 23. KIRK: YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF BACKUP OFFENSIVE TACKLES THAT ARE PLAYING GUARD. THAT IS WHO THEY GOT. AL: ROOKIE OUT OF PENN STATE. KIRK: HE IS IN PRETTY GOOD DECISION -- POSITION. A TOUGH TASK HERE. HE IS OK, BUT WHEN AARON ROGERS TAKES OFF, THAT IS WHERE HE GRABS ONTO HIM. YOU JUST HOLD YOUR BREATH, AND THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD JOB WORKING THROUGH THAT, NAVIGATING TO PICK UP HIS YARDS, BUT OBVIOUSLY, IT IS GOING TO COME BACK WITH A HOLD. AL: SO IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A FIRST AND GOAL AND BECOMES A THIRD AND 19. FOUR MAN RUSH. RODGERS TO THE END ZONE. AND WILSON. HE STAYS IN BOUNDS. THEY SAY HE WAS OUT. LASSITER HOVERING ON THAT PLAY. ALMOST A CATCH FOR THE AGES. KIRK: THE ONLY CHANCE WOULD BE THE KNEE IF IT CAME DOWN. WHAT A CATCH. WAITING FOR THAT OTHER FOOT, JUST DOES NOT GET DOWN AT THE KNEES. THAT IS WITH THE CROWD IS REACTING TO. A RIDICULOUS CATCH. MAYBE THE SHIN GETS DOWN. TERRY, WHAT ARE THEY LOOKINGT AFTER THAT INITIAL FOOT GOT DOWN WHEN IT CAME RIGHT THERE AT THE BACK L THE LEFT SHIN HIT THE GRO INBOUND. IT IS A TOUCHDOWN. AL: WELL, 10 YEARS AGO IN THIS BALLPARK, ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD, ODELL BECKHAM MADE ONE OF THE GREAT ONE HANDED GRABS OF ALL TIME. AND TONIGHT, IT IS NOT GET KIRK: ANY BETTER THAN THIS. KIRK:THAT IS AS GOOD A CATCH IS YOU WILL SEE, THE LEFT FOOT, AND, TERRY, THEY FELT THAT SHIN GOT DOWN BEFORE THE KNEE WENT >> THIS IS A GREAT SHOT. THAT SHIN TOUCHES IN BOUNDS BEFORE THE KNEE GOES OUT OF BOUNDS. THAT PUTS THEM IN BOUNDS FOR A CONTROLLED TOUCHDOWN. KIRK: UNBELIEVABLE BY WILSON. HOW ABOUT THAT THROW BY ROGERS? AL: AND THAT EXTRA POINT IS COUPLE OF MINUTES INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER ON A CATCH FOR THE AGES, ON A NIGHT ON THE JETS NEED EVERY BREAK POSSIBLY GET PERFECT. KIRK: WATCH LASSITER, THE DECISION TO MAKE THIS THERE WAS AARON ROGERS SAYING MY GUYS BETTER THAN YOURS. LOOK AT THAT COVERAGE. HE WILL STILL THROW THIS BALL, COUNTING ON THIRD AND LONG, GARRETT WILSON TO ADJUST BACK AND MAKE THE CATCH. I DON'T KNOW IF HE KNEW IT WOULD BE THIS GOOD. THIS IS AS GOOD A CATCH IS AS GOOD A CATCH AS YOU WILL EVER SEE. THE BODY CONTROL, THAT STRENGTH OF HIS, GOING BACK TO HIS ENTIRE CAREER AT OHIO STATE. THE JETS HAVE BEEN WAITING WITH THEIR BEST PLAYERS TO MAKE THE PLAYS IN CRITICAL MOMENTS, AND AARON ROGERS AND GARRETT WILSON JUST DID THAT HERE IN THE FOURTH AL: WILSON HAS ALL TOUCHDOWNS ADAMS BEING EVALUATED FOR A CONCUSSION, WATCHING THAT IN THE LOCKER ROOM. A PENNY FOR HIS THOUGHTS. SPEAKING OF THE 1-YARD LINE, HERE COMES SIMS. HE GETS WHACKED. TAKES IT TO THE FAR CENTER. MEANWHILE, THIS WAS THE CATCH 10 YEARS AGO. ODELL BECKHAM MADE THAT GRAB. THE FLAG WAS THROWN. GIVEN TO DEFENSE. KIRK: WHAT MADE THAT IMPRESSIVE, IT WAS WAY BACK THERE AND THAT STARTED A TREND ALL OVER FOOTBALL, WHERE EVERYBODY, CATCHES AND PRACTICE WITH ONE HAND. THAT WAS THE FORERUNNER TO EVERYONE TRYING TO MAKE THAT AND WE HAVE SEEN A FEW THROUGH THE YEARS. STROUD ROLLING IT. HE IS THROWING DEEP. AND HE HITS HIM AT THE 20 YARD SO THE TEXANS COME RIGHT BACK WITH A BIG-TIME ANSWER, 50 KIRK: THEY SHOW YOU TWO TITANS ON FIRST AND 10, AND THEY HAVE DONE IT ALL NIGHT. PLAY-ACTION, GET STROUD AWAY FROM THE PRESSURE, DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THIRD DOWN, WERE OFFENSIVE LINE CAN TURN THE PRESSURE ON GET HIM OUTSIDE, AND HE WAS GOING TO BE THE GUY TO STEP UP WITH INJURIES TO NICO COLLINS? AND TODAY, IT IS HIM. AL: 120 CV YARDS. TO THE OUTSIDE. BREAKING A TACKLE. AND IT IS NOW CARRY 20 TIMES FOR 98 YARDS. KIRK: KEEP THIS IN MIND AS WE GET DOWN TO CRUNCH TIME AND THE FOURTH QUARTER, THE JETS HAVE STRUGGLED ALL YEAR AND ONE POSITION GAMES. THERE 1-4 IN ONE POSITION GAMES, AND THE TEXANS, THEY ARE 5-1 IN THESE ONE POSITION GAMES, AND IF YOU GO BACK THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, THE TEXANS KNOW HOW TO WIN THESE CLOSE GAMES. AL: THEY HAVE. THROUGH THE MIDDLE GOES J.J. TAYLOR. AND THAT WILL MAKE IT THIRD DOWN AND TWO. AL: ANOTHER TIMEOUT FOR INJURY. ISAIAH OLIVER. HE WILL COME OUT FOR AT LEAST ONE PLAY. KIRK: THEY JUST PICKED UP J.J. TAYLOR AND BROUGHT HIM IN YOU NEED THAT COMPLEMENT TO WHEN HE'S HEALTHY, AND TAYLOR 26 IS DONE A HECKUVA JOB RUNNING HARD AL: TAYLOR DO NOT PLAY AT ALL IN 2003. FREE AGENT THIS YEAR. DOING AN NICE JOB TONIGHT. MIXON IS BACK, THIRD AND ONE. ROLLING. AND GOING TO GET THE FIRST DOWN. HE REACHES. THEY WILL SEE WHERE THEY SPOT KIRK: WHAT A PLAY AND A GUTSY CALL BY BOBBY'S FLUID. DID NOT GET THE BALL AND THAT RIGHT HAND TO BE ABLE TO EXTEND HE MOVES AT THE LAST SECOND, AND STROUD SHOWING, HE TRIED TO BAIT THE DEFENSE, GOOD JOB OF THE JETS COVERING IT. AT THE LAST SECOND, HE PUTS IT IN THE LEFT-HAND TO PROTECT IT. THAT IS WHAT KEPT IT FIRST DOWN. >> MEDICAL TIMEOUT. AL: AND NOW YOU HAVE ANOTHER MEDICAL TIMEOUT. WHEN THEY SEE THAT WITH NOBODY DOWN ON THE FIELD, THAT MEANS THE OFFICIAL IS TAKING A PLAYER THAT IS ALL, WHO WAS OUT, CAME BACK IN, NOW THEY HAVE TAKEN THEM OUT AGAIN. SO 10.5 LEFT IN THE FOURTH. STROUD WILL GO UNDER CENTER. MIXON IS THE BACK. GETS IT, HEAD DOWN. TO THE 12. KIRK: YOU GET BEHIND THAT RIGHT SIDE OF THE OFFENSIVE LINE, LOOK AT THE OPENING THERE. THEY ARE EXPECTING THE QUARTERBACK, AND THEY GOT AWAY FROM THAT INTERIOR AND GOT THE BALL TO THE OUTSIDE. JUST TESTING HIM WITH THAT JUMP CUT AND THE WAY HE HAS BEEN RUNNING ALL YEAR. AL: MIXON, 100 YARDS NOW, 21 CARRIES. HE IS THE BACK AGAIN, HAS THE BALL AGAIN, TAKEN OUT OF THE 11 KIRK: HE ALMOST WAS ABLE TO PULL OUT OF THEIR AND GET BACK TO THE BACKSIDE, BUT SHERWOOD WILL GET IN FOR C.J. MOSLEY. HE WAS A MENTOR FOR HIM IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT DEFENSE AND SAYS HE PRACTICES ALL THE TIME. MAKING SURE HE IS DOING HIS JOB, AND MADE A GREAT PLAY ON THAT CUTBACK RUN. AL: SECOND AND 7. NOW THEY ARE GOING TO SNAP IT. STROUD COMES OUT TO THE RIGHT. AND HE'S GOING TO SNAP HE WILL THROW IT, AND OVERTHROWS. STROUD IS LOOKING FOR A FLAG. SO THEY GO TO THE BACK OF THE PLAYBOOK WHERE MIXON THREW A TOUCHDOWN PASS AND THE SUPER BOWL AGAINST THE RAMS. KIRK: STROUD CAME UP BECAUSE SEE GRABBED ONTO HIS ARM. OF COURSE, A THREAT TO RUN THE WHOLE DEFENSE, COMES UP TO STOP THEM EXCEPT FOR REED, WHO IS ONE-ON-ONE. AND STROUD NOW HAS A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. NOW HE FELT IT HIMSELF. AL: THIRD AND 7. STROUD, TAKING IT ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE 27 BY MICHEAL CLEMONS. KIRK: I'VE BEEN BRAGGING ABOUT KENDRICK GREEN AND THE JOB HE HAS DONE STEPPING UP, AND THIS TIME, HE GETS OVERMATCHED BY CLEMENS, USED TO SEEING WILLIAMS MAKE THAT PLAY, BUT IT IS MICHEAL CLEMONS' MICHEAL CLEMONS' TIME WHO USED A GREAT MOVE AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE FOR QUICKNESS AND POWER AND THEN FINISHES IT OFF AS STROUD TRIED TO ESCAPE. AL: 15 YARD SACK AND THAT TURNS THIS INTO A 43 YARD FIELD GOAL INSTEAD OF A CHIP SHOT. TO MAKE IT A ONE-POINT GAME. FEEDS IT THROUGH. SO WITH 8:19 WITH ANOTHER FLAG. KIRK: ANOTHER ONE CAME IN. YEAH. AL: SHAWN HOCHULI GETTING THE INFO. ANSWER IS -- >> PERSONAL FOUL. UNNECESSARY CONTACT OF A SNAPPER BY THE DEFENSE. AL: OH, BABY. KIRK: ERIC WATTS, OUT 58, ROOKIE OUT OF YUKON. HE IS LINED UP RIGHT HERE. AL: UP IN THE AIR. KIRK: HE DRIVES HIS LEG RIGHT INTO THE SNAPPER'S HEAD, AND THAT IS WHY THEY MADE THE CALL, WHICH IS THE RIGHT CALL. AL: SO THE FLAG COMES UP IMMEDIATELY. PUTS THEM AT THE 12 YARD LINE. AND A FIRST DOWN. STAYS ON HIS FEET. GETS TO THE 10. KIRK: LET'S SEE IF THE TEXANS CAN CAPITALIZE ON THIS ANOTHER MISCUE FOR THE JETS ON SPECIAL TEAMS. AND NOW, ROUGHING THE SNAPPER, WHICH YOU DON'T SEE OFTEN, AND GIVES C.J. STROUD SECOND LIFE YEAR, A CHANCE TO FINISH THE DRIVE OFF, DOWN FOUR. AL: STUFFED AGAIN. MIXON TAKEN DOWN THAT TIME. SO YOU HAVE A THIRD DOWN AND 7. KIRK: GREAT SHOT, JALEN MILLS HELPING OUT. I CAN IMAGINE HOW THEY FELT RUNNING OFF THE FIELD, AND THEN THEY HAVE TO COME BACK OUT, AND THEY HAVE STEPPED UP THESE FIRST TWO PLAYS. AL: SOME CRAZY STUFF ON THIRD AND SEVEN. STROUD FIRES, NO GOOD. COVERAGE WAS VERY GOOD. STROUD COULD NOT CONNECT. STROUD IS NOW EIGHT OF 19. KIRK: STROUD WORKS FROM THE LEFT AND THEN CAME BACK, GIVING HIM ENOUGH TIME. MACHI SEASON BACK THERE, AND THEN HE COMES BACK AND WORKS BACK UNDERNEATH WHERE HE IS OPEN. HE ACTUALLY PULLED AWAY FROM THE DEFENDER AND HAD A CHANCE HERE, AND HE IS IN THE END ZONE. THAT IS A TOUCHDOWN. AL: 27 YARD ATTEMPT, TOWNSEND PUTS IT DOWN, AND HE SNAPPED AMAZING. THINGS GO ONE WAY, THEN THE THIS IS LIKE EVERY NIGHT IN NEW ORLEANS. THE JETS NOW. TOSSED BACK HERE. SOME SPACE, TACKLED IN BOUNDS AT THE 22 YARD LINE. KIRK: 6:40 TO GO IN THE GAME, UP FOUR, LOST FIVE IN A ROW, YOUR QUARTERBACK AARON RODGERS THEY CAN GET A WIN TONIGHT, STARTING TO LOOK AT THAT SCHEDULE, STARTING TO GET POSITIVE, AND THE BALL IS IN YOUR COURT. AARON AND THE JETS HAVE THE LEAD. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TURN THIS SEASON AROUND BY TRYING TO FINISH THIS GAME OFF. AL: NOTHING YOU LOVE BETTER THAN A EATING DRIVE AT THIS POINT. FROM THE OUTSIDE. BREECE HALL. SO 14 TIMES, 70 YARDS, FIVE KIRK: WE JUST TALKED ABOUT, HOW BAD DO YOU WANT THIS. GOOD JOB, A LITTLE PENETRATION. HE BOUNCES OFF A TACKLER, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN HEWITT. AARON ROGERS KNOWS HOW BIG THAT ONE WAS. AL: STAYS IN BOUNDS. NOBODY WORKS THAT CLOCK BETTER THAN NUMBER EIGHT. TAKING UP PLAY CLOCK DOWN, INSIDE FIVE. AND 5.5. WILSON IS TRYING TO STAY IN, AND HE DOES. LASSITER MAKES THAT TACKLE. KIRK: KEEP IN MIND, YOU HAVE MAX MITCHELL IN PLAIN GUARD, YOU HAVE DAVANTE ADAMS IN THE LOCKER ROOM AFTER HE WENT DOWN WITH AN INJURY, SO LAZARD IS NOT PLAYING TONIGHT, SO THIS TEAM HAS GOTTEN BACKED UP INTO A CORNER ON A SHORT WEEK, AND THEY HAVE A FOUR POINT LEAD, AND THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO FIND A COUPLE OF PLAYS HERE TO WIN THIS GAME. AL: THE TEXANS ARE SAYING WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM, WE HAVE OUR OWN. GOING TO BE A THIRD DOWN AND TWO 43. KIRK: HERE COMES ADAMS. AL: DEVONTA DAVIS -- DAVANTE PASSING THE CONCUSSION PROTOCOL AND BACK OUT THERE. KIRK: BIG BACK IN THERE. ALAN. AL: YOU CAN START TO MAKE HOUSTON USE ITS TIMEOUTS. THIRD AND 1. TRYING TO GET HIM TO JUMP, AND THEY TAKE A TIMEOUT. EXACTLY FOUR MINUTES TO PLAY IN REGULATION. >> 30 SECOND TIMEOUT. AGAIN, LET'S SEE WHAT THIS MEANS FOR HOUSTON. THEY HAVE A TWO GAME LEAD, PLUS THE ONLY TIEBREAK OVER INDIANAPOLIS, BUT FOR THE JETS, BUFFALO LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE TO WIN THE DIVISION, BUT, YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE THEY WENT SEVENTH IN THE CONFERENCE AND A WILD CARD, THEY ARE NOT DEAD YET. KIRK: NO, AND YOU LOOK AT WHO THEY HAVE LEFT, THEY HAVE ONE TEAM THAT HAS A WINNING RECORD. EVERYBODY ELSE' EVERYBODY ELSE'S 500 OR BELOW. THIS WAS THE PIVOTAL SWING GAME FOR THEM. THE SEASON WAS GOING TO GO ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, AND IS. IT IS HERE FOR THE TAKING. AL: AS YOU POINTED OUT, WE ONE TEAM REMAINING ON THE SCHEDULE IS OVER 500. WE GO TO ARIZONA, REPLAY INDIANAPOLIS. MEANWHILE, A VERY BIG THIRD AND RODGERS, THROWING, COMPLETING, GETS A FIRST DOWN. MAKES HIS FIRST TARGET, HIS FIRST CATCH OF THE NIGHT. AND THE ONLY THING IS, IT STOPS THE CLOCK AND NOTHING ELSE. NOW HOUSTON HAS TO THINK ABOUT TAKING TIMEOUTS, FIRST AND 10, 11 YARD GAME HERE. KIRK: HOW ABOUT THE CALL HERE? YOU THINK WITH THE BIG BACK, GO THE SAFEWAY, YOU TRY TO GET THE YARDS YOU NEED, INSTEAD, HE PULLS IT OUT. I THOUGHT HE MIGHT THROW IT FURTHER DOWNFIELD, BUT INSTEAD, TAKES THE SHORT THROW UNDERNEATH. AL: GETS A GOT INTO THE ACTION WHO HAD NOT SEEN ANY ACTION NOTHING HERE. THIS IS ALLEN TAKEN DOWN. KIRK: PETRI IN THE PHYSICAL NO MATTER WHAT YOUR FORMATION IS, DEMECO RYANS BELIEVES IN HIM, THEY MOVED FROM FROM SAFETY, CLOSER TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, AND NO MATTER WHAT YOU COME UP IN, HE IS A TRUE HYBRID, RUN SUPPORT GUY, REALLY A PHYSICAL PLAYER AT 200 POUNDS, AND THEY COVER THAT SLOT AL: SECOND AND 12. BALL IN THE BACKFIELD. ADAMS WIDE TO THE LEFT. WILSON COMES OUT OF THE SLOT. MAKES THE CATCH. WILSON STAYS IN BOUNDS, KEEPS THE CLOCK MOVING. PETRI MAKES THE STOP, THIRD AND AND A TIMEOUT TAKEN HERE BY THE THERE FIRST. TWOLOOK AT THIS DEFENSE, EIGHT DIFFERENT DEFENDERS HAVE PRESSURED FIVE WITH A SACK. 51.6 PRESSURE RATE, SECOND HIGHEST IN STROUD'S CAREER. LAST YEAR AND HE CAME INTO THE GAME, HE GOT PRESSURE AGAINST THIS SAME DEFENSE. AL: A BAD DAY, CONCUSSION, MIXED THE NEST -- NEXT TWO GAMES. SO THIRD AND 3. AGAIN, IN THAT SITUATION WHERE WE PICK UP A FIRST DOWN. COMPELLING THE TEXANS TO TAKE AT LEAST ONE TIMEOUT, GET A TWO MINUTE WARNING, STOP THE CLOCK THREE TIMES, BUT A BIG, BIG STOP FOR THE TEXANS COMING HERE. KIRK: YOU CAN SEE HIM TALKING, MIKE WILLIAMS, EXTRA INSTRUCTIONS. AL: EXTRA PRESSURE. AND ADAMS, TOUCHDOWN. DAVANTE ADAMS, OUT OF CONCUSSION PROTOCOL, AND INTO THE END ZONE. KIRK: WE KNOW HE IS TELLING MIKE WILLIAMS, STAY UPTIGHT, MAKE SURE YOU GIVE DAVANTE ADAMS ENOUGH ROOM TO WORK ON THAT STRAIGHT UP COVERAGE AGAINST PETRI. AL: PATTERSON. GOOD, 21-10. FIRST TOUCHDOWN AS A JET, AT 68 IN GREEN BAY WITH NUMBER EIGHT. KIRK: HE HIT HIM ON A FOURTH AND 1, THIS TIME AGAINST PETRI. HE LOSES HIS CHALLENGE, BUT I DON'T THINK HE WILL BE ABLE TO STAY WITH HIM. HE IS EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED, AND THERE IS THE RHYTHM. THERE THEY ARE, EIGHT TO 17 THE WAY THE JETS FANS HAD HOPED WHEN THEY CAUGHT HIM. AL: USED TO BE 12-17. HE CHANGED UP, ADAMS STAYS THE SAME. CHECKING HIM OUT FOR A DOWN, OUT OF BOUNDS EARLIER IN CATCHES THIS ONE, AND, TONIGHT, 91 YARDS FOR HIM, 90 FOR WILSON, ROGERS NOW AT -- RODGERS NOW AT 2-11. KIRK: THE SECOND HALF, YOU START TO VISUALIZE WITH THE JETS OFFENSE, INSTEAD OF THE POTENTIAL OF IT, YOU SEE THE REALITY OF WHAT IT CAN BE THESE NEXT EIGHT WEEKS. AL: THREE TOUCHDOWNS ON THREE DRIVES. HERE IS SIMS. AL: RIGHT. AND JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO. KIRK: NOT MUCH SWEETER THAN THIS, CONSIDERING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS TEAM NEEDING A WIN. AL: DESPERATELY. OUT OF THE DARKNESS AND INTO THE LIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN THE SECOND HALF. STROUD HAVING A ROUGH NIGHT STROUD GOING DEEP. INCOMPLETE, COVERED BY JALEN MILLS, SECOND AND 10. KIRK: WE TALK A LOT ABOUT WITH DIGGS DOWN THE REST OF THE YEAR WITH THE A.C.L., YOU GET INTO THESE OBVIOUS PASSING SITUATIONS, IT IS SUCH A DIFFERENT CHALLENGE FOR STROUD, THE PROTECTION, NOT HAVING HIS TWO MAIN TARGETS. THIS IS WHAT THE JETS HOPED TO DO EARLY, JUMP UP ON HIM TO ALLOW THE DEFENSE TO GET AFTER HIM AND BE ABLE TO PUT PRESSURE ON THESE RECEIVERS WITH TIGHT AL: CHASED AGAIN. DEEP DOWNFIELD, AND INCOMPLETE AT THREE. KIRK: THE JETS DOING A GOOD JOB SITTING BACK WITH TWO SAFETIES. THEIR WHOLE GOAL IS TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN FRONT OF THEM. AND WILLING TO GIVE UP COMPLETIONS UNDERNEATH WITH 11 POINT LEAD, 2:33 TO GO. DON' DON'T GIVE UP THE EASY SCORE. AL: 18 PRESSURES, SEVEN SACKS. UNDER DURESS ALL NIGHT. DELAY OF GAME. BETTER THAN A TIMEOUT. YOU HAVE TWO LEFT, A TWO MINUTE WARNING. OF COURSE, IT COST YOU FIVE YARDS AND MAKES IT THIRD AND 15. AGAIN, THE STANDINGS FOR THE TEXANS, TWO GAME LEAD PLUS THE TIEBREAKER. THE BILLS ON TOP, 3.5 GAMES OVER THE DOLPHINS. AND THE JETS TRYING TO SCRAMBLE BACK INTO THE RACE. THIRD AND 15. STROUD THROWS. IT IS CAUGHT, AND ON TOP OF IT TO BOOT, TAKEN DOWN, SO IT IS FOURTH AND NINE, RACING UP TO THE LINE, HAS TO GO FOR IT, TRYING TO GET IT IN BEFORE THE TWO MINUTE WARNING. LEADS NINE. GETS NONE. FLAG, HOWEVER. KIRK: IT IS ON ISAIAH OLIVER, SITTING BACK IN ZONE. AND HE JUST BLOWS PLAY UP. DO NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE A >> DEFENSE, NUMBER 23, FIRST AL: AND IN MANY BREAK HERE, DOWN BY 11, BUT HE WILL TAKE ANYTHING HE CAN GET. ONE SECOND BEFORE THE TWO-MINUTE YOU STILL HAVE THREE CLOCK STOPPAGES, KIND OF A TWO MINUTE SO FIRST DOWN AT THE 43 YARD STROUD DENIED NINE OF 22 AND HAS BEEN VERY ACCURATE THE PAST TWO SEASONS. NOT TONIGHT. TOO MUCH PRESSURE. GETS IT AWAY, DOWN THE SIDELINE. CAN HE MAKE CATCH IN BOUNDS, OFFICIALS LOOK AT EACH OTHER, AND THEY GO WHAT. THEY GO NO. THAT IN. AL: FORGET THE WORLD SERIES. MEANWHILE, A DOWN AND 10 WITH 1:55. FIRES, AND CANNOT HIT HIM. INCOMPLETE, THIRD AND 10. KIRK: A TYPE WINDOW. HE DOES A GOOD ENOUGH JOB TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE. A ROUTE THAT TOOK TIME TO WORK ACROSS. HE HAD HIM, BUT IT WOULD HAVE HAD TO BEEN A PERFECT EURO. JETS DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB, ON REDDICK, WILL MCDONNELL. AL: THIRD AND 10, 1:49. EXTRA PROTECTION IN THE THEY FLARE AROUND. FIRES, AND STOPS SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN, DALTON KIRK: THAT IS REALLY WHAT THE JETS DEFENSE WOULD LIKE, REALLY TO GIVE UP A COMPLETION, NOW YOU HAVE A FOURTH DOWN PLAY. AL: NEED TWO, HAS IT, HAS A LOT MORE, INSIDE THE 30, STEP OUT OF AS WE GET DOWN TO IT, YOU KEEP THE FIELD GOAL FIRST, YOU ARE DOWN 11, AND YOU GET A TWO POINT CONVERSION. THAT'S THE CHOICE YOU HAVE. KIRK: IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WERE MAYBE YOU TAKE A SHOT INTO THE END ZONE, MAYBE A TIME OR TWO WERE YOU DON'T WASTE TOO MUCH TIME, AND THEN YOU FIELD GOAL. I'M SURPRISED THE JETS HAVE NOT TRIED TO SPY HIM. THAT TIME, AGAINST MAN COVERAGE, AND THERE WAS JUST NOBODY OUT THERE. THAT WAS BIG YARDAGE. AL: PART OF THAN EVER TO GET THE 11 THESE DAYS, HAVING TO DECLARE THE ONSIDE KICK. STROUD FIRES. ABLE TO GET IN THERE TO BUSTED UP, SECOND DOWN AND 10. KIRK: THAT IS A FAVORABLE MATCHUP FOR THE JETS, THE ROOKIE WHO WAS A GOOD TIGHT END, BUT A LITTLE PUSH OFF THERE, BUT THEN THAT LINK THAT GARDNER HAS THERE, JUST KIND OF EASED IN COVERAGE, GOT HIS EYES TURNED, FOUND THE FOOTBALL, AND TURNS IT AWAY. TOUGH TO GET A SEPARATION FOR A TIGHT END AGAINST NUMBER ONE. AL: STRAIGHT SHOT. THROUGH THE END ZONE. NOTHING. THIRD DOWN AND 10, 1:11 ON THE CLOCK. KIRK: YOU EXPECT THEM TO DO THAT , HE HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE DOING A GOOD JOB IN COVERAGE, WE HAVE SEEN HIM UP IN RUN SUPPORT. DAVANTE ADAMS FINALLY GETS A TOUCHDOWN IN A CRITICAL MOMENT. AL: AND A GAME THAT MIGHT HAVE TAKEN HIM OUT OF THE GAME IF HE DID NOT PASS PROTOCOL. THAT IS CAUGHT. FIRST DOWN, TRYING TO GET OUT OF ROBIN WOODS, SO NOW YOU ARE DOWN TO 65 SECONDS. KIRK: YOU KEEP PLUGGING AWAY THE RECEIVERS ARE DOING A GOOD JOB WITH WORDS, GETTING OUT OF BOUNDS, SAVING THE CLOCK YOU ARE THIS CLOSE. YOU HAVE TO PUT THE BALL INTO THE END ZONE. AL: AGREED, TOTALLY. YOU GET INTO THE END ZONE, YOU NEED THE TWO POINT CONVERSION. OTHERWISE, LIGHTS OUT. FIRST DOWN, FROM THE 12. TO THE END ZONE. TOO HIGH AGAIN. XAVIER HUTCHINSON, SO EXACTLY 60 SECONDS, SECOND DOWN AND 10 UPCOMING. KIRK: DAVIS GIVING STROUD ENOUGH TIME TO STEP UP IN THE POCKET, BUT THESE LAST FOUR OR FIVE PLAYS, HE HAS THROWN TO HUTCHISON, SCHOLZ, ROBERT WOODS, HE'S TRYING TO FIND ANYBODY CAN FIND EITHER AN OPENING AGAINST ZONE FOUR PULL ACROSS ON THESE CROSSERS AGAINST MAN AL: ROLLING. BUYING TIME. OUT OF BOUNDS. STOP THE CLOCK AFTER EIGHT SECONDS HAD GONE BY. AND WHILE, YOU HAVE A DOG DOWN. IN GAME TESTING 140 YARDS OF PENALTIES, 60 AGAINST HOUSTON, 80 AGAINST NEW YORK. >> HOLDING, DEFENSE, NUMBER ONE. THE PENALTY IS HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL, ADDED TO THE PLAY, AL: GARDNER. KIRK: GARDNER AGAINST HUTCHINSON I THINK IT HAPPENS MAY INTO THE END ZONE. HUTCHINSON TRYING TO GET THEM OFF THAT RIGHT ARM. THAT IS WHERE THE FLAG CAME IN RIGHT THERE. WELL, THEY GOT IT DOWN TO ABOUT THE THREE YARD LINE HERE. AL: FIRST AND GOAL. 52 SECONDS. KIRK: BEEN ABLE TO PRESERVE THE TIMEOUTS, TOO. AL: STILL HAVE TWO. NEEDS TO GET THE TWO POINT CONVERSION TO AT LEAST MAKE IT SOMEWHAT DRAMATIC AT THE END. SURVEYING, LOOK OUT. SO THAT IS ANOTHER FIVE SECONDS OFF THE CLOCK, 47 TO GO. THERE IS GARDNER. HE WILL HAVE TO COME OUT FOR AT LEAST A PLAY. KIRK: HOW MANY -- AL: HOW MANY END OF GAME INJURIES DO YOU SEE? >> NEW YORK IS CHARGED A KIRK: HE IS JUST TRYING TO STAY UP WITH STEVEN SIMS. WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THESE CROSSING ROUTES. THAT IS WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO DO. AND IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS ALREADY FEELING SOMETHING. THE CHANGE IN DIRECTION. AL: SO YOU HAVE THE 14TH PLAY OF A DRIVE COMING. TEXANS HAVE RUN 70 FOUR PLACE THE JETS HAVE -- 74 PLACE ECCLES COMES IN, HE'S BEEN IN AND OUT TONIGHT. THREE RECEIVERS OFF TO THE LEFT. TWO TO THE RIGHT. STROUD GETS TAKEN DOWN AT THE 15 HAASON REDDICK COMING IN. WILLIAMS IS ALSO IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THAT IS EIGHT SACKS TONIGHT. AND HOUSTON TAKES A TIMEOUT. KIRK: THIS IS WHAT REDDICK SUPPOSED TO DO IN THESE SITUATIONS, WHERE YOU CAN GET HIM HOME WITHOUT HAVING TO NECESSARILY BLITZ. HE HAS THE ABILITY TO WIN AGAINST HOWARD, AND THIS FORCES THEM TO STEP UP. YOU MENTIONED WILLIAMS AND REDDICK BOTH ABLE TO COME UP, BUT JUST THE ABILITY TO MAKE A QUARTERBACK FEEL THAT PRESSURE, AND THEN YOU GET TO PUSH IN THE INTERIOR, NOWHERE TO GO. THAT WAS THE KEY3 -- NOWHERE TO GO. THAT WAS THE KEY TONIGHT. AL: HE HAS MISSED TWO FIELD GOALS. THE THIRD TIME THAT HAS HAPPENED. TRYING TO MAKE IT AN EIGHT POINT ONSIDE KICK WOULD COME AFTER THAT IF HE MAKES IT, WHICH HE DOES, SO IT IS 21-13. NOW YOU TO CLEAR THE ONSIDE KICK AND SAY A SMALL PRAYER. AND WEGAME, OF COURSE AS USUAL,' OUR GANG. NOTHING LIKE IT EITHER. WE HAVE WILSON'S HEROICS. AND THE GANG IS ALL THERE. THEY WILL BE BACK AT THE HOTEL PROBABLY AROUND 3:00. KIRK: QUITE A NIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE FOR AARON RODGERS CONSIDERING WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FIRST HALF INNING, ONE OF THE WORST HE HAS HAD AS FAR AS PRODUCTION IS CONCERNED HIS ENTIRE CAREER. THREE TOUCHDOWNS AND NO INTERCEPTIONS. AL: ONLY 9% OF THE ONSIDE KICK'S, ONE OUT OF 11 ARE RECOVERED BY THE TEAM. THEN YOU NEED TO RECOVER IT AND GET A TOUCHDOWN AND A TWO POINT THEY HAVE GARRETT WILSON. AND THE BOUNCING BALL WILL BE STOPPED BY ADAMS SO THERE IT IS. HOUSTON CAN STOP IT WITH ONE MORE TIME OUT AND THAT WILL TAKE THE JETS TO THE END OF A FIVE-GAME LOSING STREAK. SO THEY START OUT 2-1. ROGERS HAD A BIG NIGHT. LOOKING TO GET HIS FIRST VICTORY AS INTERIM HEAD COACH. >> HOW ABOUT AARON RODGERS TELLING US ON THE CALL THIS WEEK I CANNOT WAIT TO HAND HIM THAT GAME BALL ON HIS FIRST WIN? HE WILL GET THE CHANCE TONIGHT. AL: YOU HAVE INDIANA, SEATTLE, MIAMI, JACKSONVILLE. ROGERS WILL TAKE A KNEE. THE TEXANS WILL BE CONTENT TO LET THE CLOCK RUN OUT. WE TALKED TO HIM THIS WEEK. I MEAN, AARON IS VERY SMART. WHATEVER YOU THINK ABOUT HIM, HE'S A POLARIZING FIGURE, WE KNOW THAT, BUT HE'S A VERY WELL READ GUY, VERY SMART, AND IS CONVINCING. WE GO HE CANNOT RUN THE TABLE AND THEN HE MAKES YOU THINK HE CAN. >> BY THE TIME THEY ARE DONE WE GO HE MAKES A GOOD POINT. >> OFF YOU GO INTO THE WILD BLUE YONDER, SO WHO KNOWS?
