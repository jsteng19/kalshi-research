21-POINT DEFICIT AT SOLDIER FIELD. SEAN PAYTON AND ANDY REID READY TO MATCH WITS TONIGHT. HARRISON BUTKER TO KICKOFF, MARVIN MIMS JR., THE VERY SPEEDY ROOKIE WILL LET IT BOUNCE INTO END ZONE AND THE BRONCOS BEGIN PLAY AT THE 25 YARD LINE. RUSSELL WILSON. 10 YEARS IN SEATTLE, TWO SUPER BOWL APPEARANCES, A SUPER BOWL VICTORY. MUCH BETTER THIS YEAR. 5-1 TOUCHDOWN TO INTERCEPTION RATIO AND HE HAS RUN FOR 191 YARDS. KIRK: HE IS DOWN 15 POUNDS. HE SAID HE FEELS LIKE HE IS IN THE BEST SHAPE OF HIS CAREER AND HE WILL NEED IS NIGHT. HE WILL HAVE TO USE HIS AVOID PRESSURE. AL: HANDED OFF TO THE ROOKIE MCLAUGHLIN AND WHAT A STORY HE HAS BECOME. A NINE YARD GAIN FOR THE GUY WHO WAS THE ALL-TIME LEADING RUSHER IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL. HE PLAYED AT NOTRE DAME -- NOT THAT NOTRE DAME -- IN OHIO AND THEN ENDED UP AT YOUNGSTOWN STATE AND HE HAS BEEN GREAT. KIRK: THIS IS WHAT MAKES THE NFL WHAT IT IS. ALL THE SUDDEN A GUY SHOWS UP THAT NOBODY EXPECTED ANYTHING FROM AND HE BECOMES ONE OF THE GREAT STORIES IN THE LEAGUE. AL: JAVONTE WILLIAMS MISSED LAST WEEK'S GAME. MICHAEL BURTON THE FULLBACK WILL TAKE IT AND PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN ON SECOND AND 1. KIRK: SEAN PAYTON PLANS ON TAKING SOME SHOTS DOWNFIELD. THAT IS WHAT RUSSELL WILSON DOES SO WELL. YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT COACH PAYTON IS LOOKING AT THE ABILITY TO RUN THE FOOTBALL AGAINST KANSAS CITY AND KEEPING NUMBER 15 IN RED ON THE SIDELINE. AL: NOW HE HAS SAMAJE PERINE IN THE BACKFIELD. WE HAVE SEEN ALL THREE RUNNING BACKS IN THE BACKFIELD. THE PASS IS CAUGHT AND THAT IS COURTLAND SUTTON. THEY SPOT IT A LITTLE BIT SHORT OF A FIRST DOWN. TRENT MCDUFFIE MAKING THE TACKLE ON THE PLAY. KIRK: BEYOND THE NUMBERS, JUST WATCHING HIM PLAY, EVEN BEFORE WE STARTED TO PREP BEFORE THIS WEEK, IT JUST LOOKS LIKE IT IS MORE RHYTHMIC. THE BALL IS COMING OUT FASTER THAN WHAT WE SAW LAST YEAR, WHEN IT TIMES HE WAS HOLDING THE BALL HESITANT, UNSURE. SO FAR HE AND SEAN, GREAT COLLABORATION TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO MAKE HIM BETTER. AL: PERFECTLY SNIFFED OUT, JERRY JEUDY MAKES THE CATCH BUT CHAMARRI CONNER IS RIGHT THERE TO STOP HIM. KIRK: THERE WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE WRISTBAND AND NATHANIEL HACKETT TALKING TO RUSSELL WILSON ABOUT USING THE WRISTBAND, HE DECLINED. THIS YEAR WITH SEAN PAYTON, THAT WAS NOT NECESSARILY A DEBATE. IT IS, "THIS IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO" BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF VERBIAGE WITH THIS OFFENSE AND IT HELPS HIM WITH THE PLAN. AL: PLAY CLOCK GOT RESET. 25. KIRK: ANOTHER TACKLE ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE. THERE HE IS IN MOTION. AL: RUNNING BACK IS JAVONTE WILLIAMS. HE LOVES FOR ROOM AND HE IS ABLE TO PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN AND GET INTO KANSAS CITY TERRITORY! NICK BOLTON STOPPED HIM, HE HAS MISSED THE LAST THREE GAMES, BUT HE SCRAMBLES FREE AND PICKS UP THE FIRST. KIRK: YOU SEE THE EXTRA TIGHT END IS REALLY ANOTHER TACKLE. IT IS MAN ON MAN AND THEY ACTUALLY GET OFF THE BLOCKS. BOLTON, THEIR BEST TACKLER, IT IS GREAT TO SEE HIM BACK. IF THE TACKLE IS SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN. JAVONTE IS A PHYSICAL RUNNER AS YOU SEE HIM BREAKING THROUGH. AL: KEEP IT ON THE GROUND. WILLIAMS AGAIN. HE MISSED LAST WEEK WITH A QUAD INJURY. OUT OF NORTH CAROLINA. SECOND ROUND PICK IN 2021. KIRK: SOMETHING SEAN PAYTON IS KNOWN FOR, NOT ONLY THE GREAT OFFENSES WITH DREW BREES, BUT A LOT OF PERSONNEL CHANGES, DIFFERENT FORMATIONS. HE HAS HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS FOLLOWING THAT 12 TO 15 PLAY SCRIPT AND MIXING UP A LOT OF DIFFERENT LOOKS, TRYING TO AFFECT THE DEFENSE AND THEIR COMMUNICATION. AL: MCLAUGHLIN BACK. THE BRONCOS HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD ON THEIR OPENING DRIVES THIS SEASON. SO FAR, SO GOOD. THIS TIME, STUCK AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. WILLIE GAY MAKING THE TACKLE. IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 7 AS YOU LOOK AT STEVE SPAGNUOLO'S DEFENSE. KIRK: HE WILL BE PROUD OF THIS. CHRIS JONES IN THE MIDDLE DOES A GOOD JOB OF FIGHTING OFF A BLOCK AND WILLIE GAY IS ABLE TO CLEAN IT UP. THIS DEFENSE IS PLAYING GREAT FOOTBALL. VERY PHYSICAL. A LOT OF THESE GUYS IN THEIR SECOND YEAR IN SPAG'S SYSTEM. IDENTIFYING THINGS QUICKER AND FLYING AROUND. AL: THREE SUPER BOWL RINGS IN HIS SAFE DEPOSIT BOX. THIRD DOWN AND 7. LOOK OUT. WILSON GETS AWAY! THROWS, CAUGHT INSIDE THE 40. ADAM TRAUTMAN, THE TIGHT END. AVOIDS DISASTER THAT TIME, CHASED AND WILSON AVOIDS WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE 498TH OF HIS CAREER. KIRK: NOTHING TRICKY. MAN ON MAN, HE GETS IN AND HAS TO BRING HIM DOWN. GREAT EFFORT BY RUSSELL WILSON TO GET THAT PLAY ALIVE. AL: FOURTH AND 3. BALL ON THE 38. YOU HAVE LOST 15 STRAIGHT TO THIS TEAM, YOU ARE IN LAST PLACE, HE IS GOING FOR IT. MAYBE. TIMEOUT. AT LEAST HE WAS LINING UP TO GO FOR IT. REFEREE: TIMEOUT, DENVER. THE FIRST OF THE HALF. AL: SEAN PAYTON, 15 SEASONS IN NEW ORLEANS, WON A SUPER BOWL IN 2009. HE AND DREW BREES, A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN. HE WAS IN THE FOX STUDIO LAST YEAR. DENVER OPENED UP THE CHECKBOOK AND HERE HE IS. KIRK: I THINK ALL ALONG WHEN HE STEPPED AWAY AND GOT INTO TV, AT HIS AGE, HE STILL FEELS LIKE HE IS IN HIS PRIME AND HAS A LOT TO OFFER ANY ORGANIZATION. DENVER WAS IN NEED OF A COACH WITH A TRACK RECORD. HE WILL DO IT HIS WAY. HE FEELS HIS WAY IS THE RIGHT WAY. IT WILL BE A PROCESS AND IT WILL TAKE TIME. YOU HAVE TO EXPERIENCE IT TO REALLY GROW AND THAT IS WHAT THIS TEAM IS GOING THROUGH THESE FIRST FIVE WEEKS. AL: THIS WILL BE THE NINTH PLAY OF THE DRIVE. MICHAEL BURTON LINES UP NEXT TO WILSON. PRESSURE. WILSON, SCRAMBLES AWAY AGAIN. HE CANNOT RUN FOR THE FIRST DOWN AND THEY TURNED THE BALL OVER. RUN OUT BY JUSTIN REID. GEORGE KARLAFTIS ALSO CHASING HIM. STYMIED WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DRIVE EXTENDING FIRST HERE GO THE CHIEFS. THEIR FIRST PLAY IS A RUN. PACHECO, GAIN OF ABOUT 2. ZACH ALLEN MAKES THE TACKLE. PATRICK MAHOMES, A COUPLE OF M.V.P. AWARDS, TWO SUPER BOWL RINGS. AGAINST DENVER, 11-0, 18 TOUCHDOWNS, EIGHT INTERCEPTIONS. 15 CONSECUTIVE WINS. SOME OF THOSE GO BACK TO ALEX SMITH. PACHECO AGAIN. HE HAD A BIG DAY IN THE SUPER BOWL. GOOD, TOUGH RUNNING BEHIND JOE THUNEY'S BLOCK, THE LEFT GUARD, AND A FIRST DOWN FOR KC. KIRK: THAT IS WHAT WILL BE DIFFERENT FOR DEFENSES TRYING TO DEFEND KANSAS CITY. THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND THEMSELVES IN THE CHEMISTRY WITH THE RECEIVERS. PACHECO IN HIS SECOND YEAR, HE EXPLODED ONTO THE SCENE LAST YEAR AS A SEVENTH ROUNDER. NOW YOU KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM HE GIVES A BALANCED ATTACK. IN THE PAST, DEFENSES WERE MORE WORRIED ABOUT MAHOMES AND THE PASS GAME. AL: OPEN AND THEN A LITTLE FLIP BACK FOR KELCE AS HE SENDS IT TO NOAH GRAY. ONE TIGHT END TO ANOTHER. ANOTHER FIRST DOWN. KIRK: MATT MOORE AND TONY NATHAN GOING WAY BACK TO THE DOLPHINS AGAINST THE CHARGERS. HOW CALM IS KELCE? HE JUST WAITS FOR HIS GUY. HE IS JUST OUT THERE IN PRACTICE HAVING FUN. HE USED TO BE A QUARTERBACK. PERFECT PITCH TO NOAH GRAY AND A FIRST DOWN FOR THE CHIEFS. AL: HOOK AND LADDER, HOOK AND TRAILER, TAKE YOUR PICK. FIRST DOWN FROM THE 36 YARD LINE. ROLLING. LOOKS ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE FIELD, NOTHING THERE. THEN HE THROWS AND IT IS CAUGHT INSIDE THE 30 YARD LINE. THERE IS HIS MAIN MAN AGAIN, KELCE. HE CAME OUT WITH A SPRAINED ANKLE LAST WEEK, HE WAS SO FRUSTRATED. THREW HIS HELMET DOWN, IT LOOKED LIKE HE WOULD BE DOWN A WHILE. NO. KIRK: HE KIND OF FEELS IT AND SEES THE LEVERAGE IS TAKEN AWAY TO THE INSIDE SO HE CALMLY WORKS BACK TO THE OUTSIDE. THE WAY MAHOMES AND HE ARE ALWAYS IN SYNC. AL: ALREADY TWO CATCHES FOR HIM. LOOKING FOR SPACE, PACHECO. HE WILL PICK UP A FIRST DOWN. THE MAN WHO TOOK OVER FOR CLYDE EDWARDS-HELAIRE ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH LAST SEASON. VANCE JOSEPH AND THE DEFENSE IS NEAR THE BOTTOM IN EVERY CATEGORY. HE HAS TAKEN A TON OF HEAT IN DENVER. TRYING TO GET SOMETHING GOING. KIRK: THE CHALLENGE HE HAS, GIVING UP EXPLOSIVES, DEALING WITH MAHOMES. AL: KNOCK DOWN AND INCOMPLETE. JA QUAN MCMILLAN, SECOND YEAR MAN OUT OF EAST IT WILL BE SECOND AND 10. KIRK: PEOPLE WHO DEFEND MAHOMES SIT BACK WITH TWO SAFETIES DEEP. THE PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU ARE STRUGGLING TO STOP THE RUN -- DEAD LAST IN THE LEAGUE STOPPING THE RUN -- YOU NEED TO SAFETIES TO COME DOWN AND HELP WITH THE RUN. THAT IS THE CAT AND MOUSE GAME FOR VANCE JOSEPH. AL: GIVING UP 36 POINTS PER GAME. OVER THE MIDDLE. TAKEN DOWN AT THE 18 YARD LINE, RASHEE RICE, ROOKIE OUT OF SMU, SECOND ROUNDER. MAHOMES LOVES TO SPREAD IT AROUND. FOUR OUT OF THE FIVE GAMES, HE HAS HIT 10 OR MORE RECEIVERS. KIRK: AS THE SEASON GOES ON, RASHEE RICE WILL BECOME A GO TO GUY. STILL A ROOKIE, FEELING THINGS OUT. OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE, HE STARTS TO PEEK. HE CAME BACK AND MADE A PERFECT THROW. AL: THIRD AND 3. THAT IS BATTED AT THE LINE OF THAT SETS UP A FOURTH DOWN. MIKE PURCELL BATTING IT DOWN, NUMBER 98. HARRISON BUTKER WILL COME INTO TRY TO MAKE IT A 3-0 GAME. KIRK: HE IS A BIG FELLA. TRYING TO GET IT OUT TO THE RIGHT TO KADARIUS TONEY. THAT WOULD BE A FIRST DOWN HE GOT IT OVER PURCELL BUT PURCEELL MAKES A NICE PLAY. AL:AL: HERE IS HARRISON BUTKER. HE HAS MISSED ONLY ONE, FROM 51 THE WIND IS SWIRLING. THAT KICK IS GOOD. FLUTTERING THROUGH. IT WILL BE THAT KIND OF NIGHT WITH EVERY KICK TONIGHT. THIS IS GAME NUMBER 419, REGULAR SEASON AND POSTSEASON, IN THE HISTORY OF THIS BUILDING. OPENING UP IN 1972. RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO WHERE THE ROYALS HAVE PLAYED SINCE ABOUT THAT SAME TIME. KIRK: YOU THINK YOU HAVE CALLED MORE GAMES HERE? AL: A LOT. KIRK: A LOT OF PLAYOFF GAMES. AL: PRESEASON GAMES. TOUCHBACK HERE. I EVEN CALLED AGAIN HERE, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, WITH HANK STRAM, THE YEAR AFTER HE GOT FIRED AS THE KANSAS CITY COACH. THE TOWN WAS GOING CRAZY AT THAT POINT. HANK WANTED TO KNOW IF SOMETHING HAD BEEN MOVED IN HIS OFFICE. KIRK: WHAT WAS THE ANSWER? AL: I SAID YES, HE DID. HE WAS NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT. KIRK: THIS IS A PASSIONATE FAN BASE. AL: VERY. RUNNING BACK IS JAVONTE THERE HE GOES, BIG HOLE. EXPLOITS THAT BABY. TOUGH RUNNING FOR A GAIN OF 18 MICHAEL BURTON, THE FULLBACK, LED THE WAY. KIRK: A NICE JOB ON THE RIGHT SIDE, AS WELL. WATCH THIS DOUBLE-TEAMED. OPENS UP A BLOCK FOR THE FULLBACK BURTON, WHICH YOU MENTIONED. I DO NOT THINK THE NFL HAS SEEN WHAT JAVONTE WILLIAMS CAN DO WHEN HE IS HEALTHY. 220 POUNDS AND BRINGS A LOT OF PHYSICALITY. AL: HE TORE HIS ACL IN THE FOURTH WEEK LAST SEASON AND WAS DONE FOR THE SEASON. PLAY-ACTION. GOOD POCKET. INTERCEPTED AT THE 42 YARD LINE. NICK BOLTON, RIGHT THERE. INTENDED FOR JERRY JEUDY. DOWN INTO THE END ZONE THEY GO, THE DEFENSE, TO CELEBRATE. WILSON THREW IT RIGHT TO HIM AND KC GETS IT. 3-0, CHIEFS. KIRK: DENVER GOES WITH A PLAY TO TRY TO GO HERE. THEY ARE TRYING TO AFFECT THE BACKER. WATCH OUT NICK BOLTON PLAYS THIS. KEEP IN MIND HE HAS BEEN OUT FOR THREE WEEKS. HE SEES THE BACK GOING HERE AND RIGHT AWAY HE GETS HIS HEAD ON A SWIVEL. HE IS ABLE TO LOOK BACK AND RECOGNIZE, HERE IS THE ROUTE. HE READS THE EYES OF RUSSELL WILSON AND I RUSSELL WILSON MIGHT HAVE PREDETERMINED WHERE TO GO WITH THAT FOOTBALL. AL: WIDE OPEN, KELCE. STIFF-ARMING DOWN THE SIDELINE. A LONG GAIN. RUN OUT BY JUSTIN SIMMONS. IT IS JUST ASTONISHING HOW OPEN THIS GUY GETS WHEN EVERYONE KNOWS HE WILL GET THE PASS. NOW YOU HAVE A FLAG AT THE END OF THE PLAY. REFEREE: BEFORE THE PASS WAS THROWN, HOLDING, DEFENSE, NUMBER 27. THIS PENALTY IS DECLINED IN THE PLAY RESULTS IN THE FIRST DOWN. KIRK: THEY CLEAR OUT. HE JUST KIND OF WORKS HIMSELF ACROSS THE FIELD. WITH MAN-TO-MAN ON THE RIGHT WITH MATHIS, THERE IS NOBODY OVER THERE. DOES IT EVER SURPRISE EVEN YOU GUYS THAT 87 ON YOUR BALLCLUB ALWAYS SEEMS TO GET OPEN? AL: IT IS CRAZY. HE IS OPEN BY 10 YARDS ON SO MANY CATCHES. AT THE 17 YARD LINE. KIRK: GET HIM BACK OVER THERE. AL: BRING HIM BACK. TONEY, THAT GOES NOWHERE. MCMILLAN MAKES THE TACKLE. LOSS ON THE PLAY OF THREE, SECOND AND 13. KIRK: THE EDGE OF THE DEFENSE HAS BEEN A PROBLEM. IT IS SOMETHING VANCE JOSEPH HAS EMPHASIZED. THIS WEEK COMING AGAINST THIS QUICK HITTING OFFENSE, THEY LIKE TO GET THE BALL TO THE PERIMETER. RUSS HOPING THIS DEFENSE HOLDS UP AGAIN AND FORCES A FIELD GOAL. AL: GOOD POCKET. PASS CAUGHT. 15 YARD LINE AND WRESTLED DOWN. PACHECO WRESTLED DOWN BY JOSEY JEWELL AND ALEX SINGLETON. IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 8 AFTER A GAIN OF 5. KIRK: THIS IS A TEAM THAT HAS STRUGGLED WITH MISSED TACKLES, MOST IN THE NFL. RIGHT NOW ON A SHORT WEEK, A COUPLE SERIES IN, EVERYONE GETTING THEIR FEET UNDER THEM AND GETTING THE FEEL FOR WHAT IS COMING AT THEM AND THEY ARE HOLDING UP PRETTY WELL. LET' LET'S SEE IF THEY GET PRESSURE ON MAHOMES ON THIRD DOWN. AL: JERICK MCKINNON IN THE BACKFIELD. THREE RECEIVER SET TO THE RIGHT SIDE. MAHOMES, PRESSURE, LOOK OUT. HE GETS IT AWAY AND SLINGS IT AND IT IS PICKED OFF AT THE GOAL LINE! JUSTIN SIMMONS. SO, DENVER IS ABLE TO HOLD THEM. YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO DOWN 10-0 ON THE ROAD. THEY KEEP IT AT 3-0 AND THEY GET THE BALL BACK. HE WAS UNDER PRESSURE, I THOUGHT HE WAS TRYING TO THROW IT AWAY. SIMMONS COMES UP WITH THE PICK. WITH 2:55 TO GO IN THE QUARTER, DENVER WITH THE BALL. KIRK: USUALLY THIS LOOK WITHAL, TWO SAFETIES HIGH, THIS BACK WILL RUN WITH HIM. HE DOES NOT. MAHOMES LOCKED IN. HE WANTED TO GET INTO KELCE BUT THEY SQUEEZED HIM. HE ACTUALLY GOT HIT WHILE HE RELEASED IT. THE BALL GOES UP INTERCEPTION BY THE DENVER IF HE IS IN TACKLE, HE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN THAT BACK. AL: FROM THE SEVEN YARD LINE. 4-YARD GAIN. KAYLEE: NO ONE HAS INTERCEPTED PATRICK MAHOMES MORE THAN JUSTIN SIMMONS. THAT MAKES FOUR. SIMMONS TOLD ME THE KEY IS BEING IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND BEING DISCIPLINED EVEN WHEN MAHOMES BREAKS THE POCKET. LAST YEAR AFTER HE GRABBED HIS THIRD PICK, HE SAID MAHOMES JOKE WITH HIM THAT I LOVE THROWING YOU THE FOOTBALL. HE SAID I WILL NOT COMPLAIN. AL: THAT IS HIS FIRST PICK THIS SIMMONS HAS BEEN WITH THE BRONCOS FOR EIGHT YEARS. HE SAID HE IS SICK OF LOSING. A GOOD LITTLE CUTBACK AND THE BALL IS OUT! IS IT OUT AFTER THE PLAY WAS OVER, IS THE QUESTION? KANSAS CITY THINK THAT WAS. THE OFFICIALS COME IN AND SAY, THEY DO SAY IT IS A FUMBLE. CHECK THAT BABY OUT. DRUE TRANQUILL. THEY WILL REVIEW THIS. REFEREE: AFTER DISCUSSION, THE RUNNER WAS DOWN BY CONTACT. IT IS DENVER'S BALL. KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAD POSSESSION OF THAT FOOTBALL. REFEREE: IT IS THIRD DOWN AND SHORT. AL: HE GOT THE WORD FROM ABOVE. IT WAS NOT A FUMBLE. THEY GET AWAY WITH IT HERE WITH 2 MINUTES TO GO IN THE QUARTER. HE IS A LITTLE SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN. IT IS THIRD DOWN AND 1. KIRK: GREAT JOB BY THE OFFICIALS COMING TOGETHER AND MAKING THE RIGHT CALL. AL: WHY REVIEW IT WHEN YOU GET THE WORD FROM UPSTAIRS? IT IS SIMPLER. MIKE THE PITCH CLOCK IN BASEBALL, IT MAKES IT MUCH EASIER. THIRD DOWN AND 1. JAVONTE WILLIAMS IS THE RUNNING BACK. AND WILSON WILL SNEAK AHEAD OVER THE RIGHT GUARD TO PICK UP A WHAT DO YOU THINK -- WE LOOKED AT RUSSELL WILSON PLAYING -- WHAT DID YOU THINK WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT HE WAS IN SEATTLE AND WHAT THEY TRY TO DO WITH HIM LAST YEAR? KIRK: I THINK HE WAS SITTING IN THE POCKET AND STRUGGLING TO SEE COVERAGE. I THINK THIS YEAR THEY HAVE GONE BACK TO WHAT WORKS. THEY WILL MOVE HIM ON THE LAUNCH THE BALL IS EITHER OUT QUICKLY WITH THE QUICK GAME, GET HIM OUT ON THE EDGES, AND TAKING SHOTS DOWNFIELD. AL: JERRY JEUDY TO THE 20. JEUDY BEING TALKED ABOUT AS A GUY IF THEY ARE GOING TO TRADE AND PICK UP DRAFT CHOICES -- THE TRADE DEADLINE IS AT THE END OF THE MONTH -- HE IS ONE OF THE GUY THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. KIRK: HE HAS HAD MOMENTS THAT WERE GOOD BUT HE HAS NOT BEEN CONSISTENT. THEY NEED HIM TONIGHT. YOU LOOK AT THE RECEIVERS. SUTTON, MIMS. AT SOME POINT YOU WILL TAKE SOME VERTICAL SHOTS AND RECEIVERS WILL HAVE TO MAKE SOME BIG PLAYS. AL: SECOND AND 8. GOOD, TOUGH RUNNING. MCLAUGHLIN CAME INTO THE GAME AVERAGING OVER 7 YARDS PER CARRY. THE LEAGUE AVERAGE IS 4.2. YOUNGSTOWN STATE, UNDRAFTED FREE AGENT. LIGHTED IT UP IN TRAINING CAMP AND EVERYONE FELL IN LOVE W KIRK: HE IS ABOUT A HUNDRED 85 POUNDS. HE HAS BEEN DETERMINED SINCE HE SHOWED UP AT DAY 1. HE GOT THERE AT 6:00 IN THE MORNING AND WANTED TO SEE THE SCRIPT. THIS WAS WHEN HE DID NOT SEE ANY REPS. HE JUST KEPT HANGING AROUNDA FEW ARROWHEAD. START THE SECOND QUARTER WITH A THIRD DOWN AND 1 FOR DENVER AND THEY GIVE IT TO THE UPBACK AND HE WILL NOT GET IT. THEY GIVE IT TO BURTON, CANNOT GET IT. FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: WHAT A TREMENDOUS EFFORT, SHORT YARDAGE. WATCH THIS MOVE RIGHT HERE BY 94. YOU DO NOT HEAR ABOUT HIM AS MUCH BUT THE QUICKNESS OFF THE BALL, SHOOTS THAT GAP AND JUST EXPLODES. THE TIGHT END NEEDS TO COME DOWN AND HELP. BURTON NEVER HAD A CHANCE. AL: RILEY DIXON IS THE DENVER PUNTER. LINE DRIVE KICK. FIELDED AT HIS KNEECAPS BY MONTRELL I WOULD SAY THAT IS CLU ELITE. KIRK: HIS FIRST FIVE YEARS AS A STARTER. HE HAD THE ONE START AS A ROOKIE. FIVE YEARS, FIVE AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES. AL: HERE IS ISIAH PACHECO OUT TO THE 49 YARD LINE. KIRK: MAHOMES HAS TALKED ABOUT BEING PATIENT AND NOT TAKING CHANCES, NOT TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN. OF COURSE, HE DID THAT ON THE SECOND POSSESSION. HIS DEFENSE HAS PUT HIM IN A GOOD SPOT. THEY ARE STARTING AT THEIR OWN 41, 43 AND 43 UNDER THIRD POSSESSION BUT ONLY 3 POINT SO FAR. AL: SECOND AND 5. PACHECO AGAIN, COMING IN FROM THE CORNER WAS PATRICK SURTAIN, ONE OF THE BEST IN THE LEAGUE. THIRD YEAR. NUMBER 1 PICK FROM ALABAMA. IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 5. KIRK: SURTAIN GETS A LOT OF RECOGNITION BECAUSE HE IS SUCH A GIFTED COVER CORNER BUT FOLKS AROUND THE LEAGUE LOVE HIS ABILITIES AT 6'2", 202 BECAUSE OF PLAYS LIKE THAT, A GREAT JOB IN RUN SUPPORT. AL: COMING ACROSS THE LINE. WHO WENT FIRST IS THE QUESTION. PERKINS RIGHT OVER DONOVAN REFEREE: NEUTRAL ZONE INFRACTION, DEFENSE, NUMBER 51. THIS FIVE YARD PENALTY RESULTS IN A FIRST DOWN. AL: IT IS PERKINS ON WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A THIRD AND 5. KIRK: I THINK THIS IS ALL BECAUSE OF MAHOMES KNOWING THE SITUATION, REALIZING THE HARD COUNT COULD POTENTIALLY DRAW SOMEBODY OFF. RIGHT THERE. RONNIE PERKINS NOT PLAYING A LOT. WHEN HE GETS IN, HE IS EAGER. AL: CHIEFS' AL: CHIEFS' FIFTH FIRST DOWN. THE FAKE, PASS, KADARIUS TONEY. CAME OVER FROM THE GIANTS. SURTAIN IS COVERING ON THE PLAY. THAT WILL MAKE IT SECOND DOWN AND 5. KIRK: VANCE JOSEPH TELLING US THIS WEEK, WE HAVE TO MAKE GAME CHANGING PLAYS. THAT IS WHAT THEY DID ON THE LAST POSSESSION. HE HAS BEEN AS FRUSTRATED AS ANYONE. THE MEDIA GETS UPSET, FANS GET UPSET, I DO NOT KNOW IF ANYONE HAS BEEN MORE UPSET THE WAY THINGS HAVE GONE THAN VANCE JOSEPH. DETERMINED TO GET IT RIGHT. OFF TO A GOOD START TONIGHT. AL: MAHOMES CHASED OUT, FLAG THROWN. GOES DEEP AND THROWS THAT AWAY. NOBODY IS HOME. FLAG IN THE OFFENSIVE BACKFIELD. REFEREE: HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER 74. 10 YARD PENALTY, REPLAY SECOND DOWN. AL: THE DENVER DEFENSE, AT LEAST TO THIS POINT, KEEPING THEM VERY MUCH IN THE GAME. KIRK: ALL THREE OF THESE POSSESSIONS CLOSE TO MIDFIELD. UP TO THIS POINT, THEY HAVE PUT A PLAN TOGETHER. YOU LOOK AT THESE TWO TEAMS ON PAPER, DENVER WILL HAVE THEIR HANDS FULL AGAINST MAHOMES. BUT THEY SHOW UP ON A SHORT WEEK WITH A GOOD PLAN. THEY ARE PLAYING A LOT FASTER. AL: NOT EASY, EITHER. YOU LOSE A GAME ON SUNDAY, YOU HAVE MONDAY AND TUESDAY AT HOME, YOU FLY ON WEDNESDAY AND YOU ARE PLAYING THE WORLD CHAMPS ON THURSDAY. A NICE HOLE, THAT IS CLYDE EDWARDS-HELAIRE. A COUPLE YEARS AGO HE LOOKED LIKE HE WOULD BE THEIR ACE RUNNING BACK A LONG TIME. IT LASTED AS LONG AS IT TOOK FOR ISIAH PACHECO TO GET IN THE KIRK: GOING INTO LAST YEAR, A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT HE WAS THE GUY BUT ONCE PACHECO SHOWED WHEN HE COULD DO -- WHAT DID MAHOMES TELL US? HE RUNS LIKE HE IS ANGRY AT THE GROUND. THAT IS HOW PHYSICAL AND HOW TOUGH HE RUNS. I HAVE HEARD RUNNING ANGRY BUT NOT RUNNING ANGRY AT THE GROUND. AL: THAT IS A GREAT DESCRIPTION. THIRD AND 8. MAHOMES STEPPING UP, LOOK OUT FROM BEHIND. HIT AS HE THROWS. KOK, FIRST DOWN WHO ELSE? 87, KELCE. MAHOMES IS CHASED FROM BEHIND ON THE NEXT AGAIN NO, THEY ARE ON THE MARCH AGAIN. KIRK: THESE GUYS ARE AS GOOD AS THERE IS AT RUNNING ROUTES AND ONCE THE ROUTE IS TAKEN AWAY, ESPECIALLY ON THIRD DOWN -- WATCH THE RECOGNITION HIS QUARTERBACK IS IN TROUBLE AND HE FINDS A SOFT SPOT. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE SEEN IT? IT IS ONE THING TO DRAW THE PLAY UP BUT MAHOMES AND KELCE DESERVE SO MUCH CREDIT FOR THOSE OFF SCHEDULE PLAYS. AL: PACHECO. FINALLY WRESTLED DOWN. -- THAT TURNS WHAT WOULD'VE BEEN A 67 YARD GAIN INTO A NINE YARD GAIN. KIRK: THE OTHER THING ABOUT KELCE' KELCE'S WHEN HE DOES THE ADJUSTMENTS, IT LOOKS SO ROUTINE. THERE IS NO PANIC. THERE IS NO WHERE AM I LOOKING. IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE HE IS JUST OUT OF THE PRACTICE FIELD AND HIM AND MY HOMES ARE OUT THERE MID JULY WORKING ON ROUTES. HE IS OUT THERE AGAINST THE BRONCOS ON A THURSDAY NIGHT. AL: TO THE 14 YARD LINE. THAT IS PER CHECK. KIRK: STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE TACKLES. SMITH ON THE LEFT AND TAYLOR ON THE RIGHT. THE INTERIOR IS AS GOOD AS YOU ARE GOING TO FIND. CREED HUMPHREY, A CENTER OUT OF OKLAHOMA. DOES A GREAT JOB WITH LEVERAGE AND BEING THE BOSS. TRACING IT ON THE RIGHT SIDE. THOSE TWO INSTRUMENTAL OPENING THE PLAY UP. AL: PACHECO AGAIN. CANNOT GET AROUND THE CORNER. >> AS YOU WERE DESCRIBING ISAIAH UP A CHECK OF RUNNING STYLE, HE SAYS HE WANTS ENERGY TO BE IS DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC. TWO TO GO AFTER HE GOT TACKLED BY THE JETS, HE STARTED DOING PUSH-UPS. HE TOLD ME HE WANTED TO SHOW THE OPPONENT HE IS NOT TIRED AND GIVES THE TEEN ENERGY THEY CAN BUILD OFF OF. HE HAS ALSO LEARNED SOME PATIENTS. AL: AND OTHER SEVENTH ROUND DRAFT. PLAYED AT RECORDS. SECOND AND 11. MAHOMES THROWS. ONCE AGAIN, ALREADY FOR KELCE. HE HAS CAUGHT FIVE. 72 RECEIVING YARDS. KIRK: THEY ARE MOVING HIM MORE THIS YEAR THAN ANY YEAR IN THE PAST. THEY MOVED HIM IN THE PAST BUT THEY ARE MOVING HIM AROUND A LITTLE MORE. TO TRY TO CREATE SOME MATCHUPS. THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY A DESIGNED ROUTE LIKE ON A ROUTE TREE. THIS IS HIM IMPROVISING. MATT 90 TELLING US THIS WEEK, THEIR DOWN SACCADIC MOMENTS AND AT THE RED ZONE, WE LET HIM DO WHAT HE CAN DO. AL: THIRD DOWN AND 2. MAHOMES SPINNING AROUND. FIRES AND THAT IS INCOMPLETE. TRIED TO GET INTO THE END ZONE TO SKY MOORE. THE DEFENSE ONCE AGAIN SETTING UP A FOURTH DOWN. THE CROWD IS NOT LIKE THE FIELD GOAL UNIT IS COMING IN. KIRK: PRESSURE COMES RIGHT HERE. HE GOT RONNIE PERKINS ON THE THIRD AND FIVE. LOOK AT ALL THAT WORK HE IS DOING. PERKINS IS ABLE TO STAY WITH HIM AND ZONE BEHIND IT. GOOD JOB BY VANCE GILL SIFT HAVING THE DEFENDERS WHERE THEY NEED TO BE. AL: SHIP SHOT FIELD GOAL. 25 YARDS. NOW YOU HAVE A FAKE HERE. DO THEY PICK UP THE FIRST IS THE QUESTION. THEY RUN A FAKE. IT LOOKED LIKE TOMMY TOWNSEND WHO IS THE HOLDER COMES UP WITH IT. TRYING TO ON PILE EVERYBODY HERE. KIRK: NOAH GRAY GETS BEHIND THE CENTER. >> THE REALLY ON THE FIELD AS THE RUNNER WAS SHORT. TURNOVER ON DOWNS. AL: THEY RUN A FAKE. IT DOES NOT WORK. KIRK: NOAH GRAY GETS IN HERE. EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO GET THEM ACROSS THE LINE. KIRK: NOAH GRAY IS GOING TO GET UNDER CENTER. YOU SEE THE HOLDER COME IN. THE BACKUP LEFT TACKLE. MORRIS, THEY' MORRIS, THEY'RE PUTTING AS MUCH SIZE AS THEY CAN. THAT IS EQUIVALENT TO WHAT YOU SEE PHILLY AND ALL THESE TEAMS DOING WITH THE SNAKE. DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN THEY PRACTICE THE PLAY. WE HAVE TO GIVE DENVER A LOT OF CREDIT. AL: LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE READY FOR IT THE WAY THEY WERE LINED UP. KIRK: AT THEIR OWN 42 AND I GOT THREE POINTS. AL: DENVER STARTING DEEP IN THEIR OWN TERRITORY. THAT IS WILLIAMS. KANSAS CITY THREE POSSESSIONS WITH DRIVES ENDING AT THE 17. THE FIVE ON DOWN. ANDY REID'S TEAM. PICKING UP A LOT OF YARDAGE. BUT ONLY THREE POINTS SO FAR. CAN DENVER GET ANYTHING GOING OFFENSIVELY NOW? 18 PLAYS WITH 73 YARDS. FOUR PER PLAY. MCLACHLAN IS THE BACK. DANGEROUS BUT CAUGHT. JUST GOT ACTIVATED. MAKING THE GRAB RIGHT THERE. KIRK: DOES A GOOD JOB OF GETTING INTO HIS FACE. NOT LETTING HIM GET OUTSIDE. I REALLY THOUGHT MCDUFFIE CAME CLOSE TO JUMPING THAT. RUSSELL WILSON JUST GETTING IT IN. AL: WILSON FIVE OUT OF SIX. 17 YARDS. SPREAD THEM ALL OUT. THE FULLBACK. INCOMPLETE. NUMBER 56 BATS IT. KIRK: AND ASHLEY SHOWED PRESSURE UP THE MIDDLE WITH BOLTON DID HE AND STASH WITH BOLTON. AND ASHLEY ENDS UP DROPPING OUT. YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET SOME KIND OF LOOK. VERY ATHLETIC EDGE PLAYER. GOOD JOB GETTING HIS HAND UP. AL: 34 PASSES KNOCKED DOWN AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. THE MOST IN THE LEAGUE. DIXONS PUNT A GOOD ONE. RECOVERED AT THE 38 YARD LINE BY MONTRELL WASHINGTON. SIX AND A HALF TO GO IN THE HALF. A WEIRD ONE. 3-0, KANSAS CITY. 52 YARD BOOT. LOOK AT OUR SPOTLIGHT PRESENTED BY BURGER KING. IT HAS BEEN A GOOD START FOR TRAVIS KELSEY. THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN HE AND PATRICK MAHOMES ALWAYS ON DISPLAY. SO IMPRESSIVE. KELCE LOOKS AROUND AND FINDS LEVERAGE AND GOES THE OTHER WAY. SO OFTEN WE SEE 15 87, 5 TARGETS ON THE NIGHT. YET TO GET IT INTO THE END ZONE. AL: NOW MY AL: NOW MAHOMES AND COMPANY GO TO WORK. FIRES. HE IS UNSTOPPABLE. ON THE 50 YARD LINE. SIX CATCHES. ALREADY HAS 89 RECEIVING YARDS. KIRK: THE BIGGEST CONCERN VANCE JOSEPH HAS HAD TONIGHT IS HIS LINEBACKERS ARE GOOD AGAINST A RUN BUT THERE IS A LOT OF SPACE AND AN AREA YOU KNOW ANDY REID AND PATRICK MAHOMES WANT TO ATTACK IS IN FRONT OF THE SAFETIES AND BETWEEN THE LINEBACKERS. FINDING THE SOFT SPOT. THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT. THE RECEIVERS, ONLY 26 YARDS COLLECTIVELY. AL: HOW DO YOU THINK THE ANKLE IS HOLDING UP? NOAH GRAY MAKES THAT GRAB THERE. KIRK: WHEN YOU'RE HERE IN KANSAS CITY FOR A COUPLE DAYS, ALL YOU ARE HEARING ABOUT IS WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE RECEIVERS. WE KNOW ABOUT KELCE AND MAHOMES AND PACHECO AND THE RUN IT SEEMS EVER SINCE TYREEK HILL LEFT, THAT WAS THE QUESTION. IT MOTIVATED THEM TO A SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP. MAHOMES IS CONFIDENT HIS GROUP WILL GET IT. AL: A LITTLE FLIP HERE, PACHECO. HE TAKES IT INSIDE THE 30 YARD A LATERAL THERE. A RUSH FOR 15 YARDS. AFTER PACHECO, HE HAS CARRIED EIGHT TIMES FOR 41 YARDS. KIRK: THEY BRING SOME PRESSURE. GETS RIGHT OUTSIDE OF IT. A QUICK SWEEP. BALL TO THE PERIMETER AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN. PACHECO HAS ROOM TO WORK AND GETS DOWNHILL. VERY GIFTED AND TOUGH TO BRING DOWN. AL: PLAY ACTION. CAUGHT. JUGGLED. HOLDS ON. KELCE AGAIN. AT A CERTAIN POINT, HOW DO YOU STOP HIM? KIRK: YOU PUT CERTAIN ON IT. THAT IS HOW YOU STOP IT. YOUR BEST COVER GOOD, ONE OF THE BEST I THE LEAGUE. THEY SAID LET'S PUT 21 87. BETTER COVERAGE BUT A GOOD JOB OF RUNNING AWAY FROM IT. A BIG MAN CAN BRING THAT ONE IN. AL: 109 RECEIVING YARDS. FIRST AND GOAL FROM THE NINE. THROWS THAT ONE. SECOND AND GOAL. KIRK: UP TO THIS POINT, THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MOVE THE BALL QUICKLY. LAST TIME THEY WERE DOWN IN THIS AREA, THREE TIMES OUT OF THE RED ZONE AND JUST THE THREE POINTS, VANCE JOSEPH TIGHTENING THINGS ANYTIME YOU GET DOWN HERE, THEY GET TIGHTER. TRAVIS KELCE TO THE RIGHT. AL: SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. FINDING SOME ROOM. PACHECO ANGRY AT THE GROUND. IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND GOAL. KIRK: TOOMEY CAME AROUND AND TOOK OUT JONATHON COOPER. OPENED IT UP NICELY. GOT UP UNDERNEATH THE BLOCK. THE PASSING GAME NOT IN RHYTHM DOWN HERE. BUT AS A GOOD THING ABOUT THE CHIEFS. THEY CANNOT TURN TO THE LINE. AL: KELCE IS PHENOMENAL IN THE RED ZONE. CAUGHT FOR A TOUCHDOWN. TONY INTO THE END ZONE. THEY FINALLY BREAK THROUGH. SEVEN PLAYS. 62 YARDS. 3:22. IN THE WAY OF THE SLOT CORNER. MCMILLAN SLOWS HIS ROUTE DOWN. CREATES JUST ENOUGH OF A PICK TO GET HIM TO THE EDGE WITH RELATIVE EASE. MAHOMES IS ABLE TO GET TO THE TOUCHDOWN. AL: A FLAG BEFORE THE SNAP. FALSE START. OFFENSE, NUMBER 65. FIVE YARD PENALTY. AL: TONY WAS THE GUY -- THE GIANTS HAD SUCH HIGH HOPES FOR FIRST ROUND PICK IN 2021. THEY SAID WE HAVE SEEN ENOUGH AT THIS POINT. KIRK: YOU HAVE THE KNEE SURGERY IN JULY. HAD A SPRAINED TO. THEY HOPE AS HE GETS HEALTHY THEY CAN BE A DIFFERENCE MAKER FOR HIM. AL: 38 YARD EXTRA POINT. NO PROBLEM. 3:06 REMAINING IN THE FIRST THE KANSAS CITY CHIEFS LEAD THE BRONCOS 10-0 AT HALFTIME. KIRK: TURNED THEIR SEASON AL: ABSOLUTELY. NEXT THURSDAY NIGHT. A TOUCHBACK. WILSON, IF ANYTHING HE IS FIVE OF SEVEN FOR 17 YARDS. KIRK: FIRST DRIVE LIKE WE HAVE SEEN FOR MOST OF THE YEAR, THE SCRIPTED START WITH SEAN PAYTON. HELD THE BALL FOR 95 MINUTES. LAST THREE DRIVES, THREE PLAYS AND OUT. STARTED AT THEIR OWN 25, THEIR OWN SEVEN AND THEIR OWN FIVE. AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO ANSWER THIS OFFENSE. AL: KANSAS CITY IS GOING TO GET THE BALL TO START THE SECOND ROLLING RIGHT. KNOCKED DOWN. NO CHANCE ON THAT ONE. ANOTHER ONE WE TALK ABOUT -- CAN'T A CITY OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS LEADING THE LEAGUE BY A LOT. KIRK: HE IS NOT COMING UP WITH A TON OF SACKS BUT HE IS DOING A GOOD JOB IN HIS SECOND YEAR OF GETTING MORE PRESSURE DID NOT ABLE TO GET THE PRESSURE BUT RUSSELL WILSON, LISTED 5' 5'11", MAYBE 5'10". GETTING HANDS UP AND BATTING BALLS DOWN. AL: THE 31 AND A LITTLE BIT MORE AS HE GETS SHELVED OUT TO THE -- GETS SHELVED OUT TO THE 34 YARD LINE. KIRK: WILLIAMS HAD THE ACL WE FOUR LAST YEAR. JUST ABOUT A YEAR AGO, A QUAD HELT ABOUT OF WEEK FOUR. AL: THIRD DOWN AND TWO. MCGLOCKLIN IS THE BACK. WILSON ROLLS OUT. LOOKING TO RUN. 30 YARD LINE. GRIPS HIM UP. KIRK: TRIED TO TO SECURE THE EDGE BUT TAKE AWAY POTENTIAL RECEIVER S RECEIVER . BY DOING THAT YOU ARE GOING TO PROTECT THE QUARTERBACK SHOULD THE PROBLEM IS YOU ONLY HAVE TWO RECEIVERS. NOTHING RUSSELL WILSON COULD DO. AL: TWO MINUTE WARNING. 10-0, KANSAS CITY. THERE THEY ARE. TO WRANGLE THE TROOPS AT HALFTIME. GET TONY TO WEIGH IN ON KELCE. RILEY DIXON SENDS THIS SKYWARD. A STOP AT ABOUT THE 18 WITH 1:49. CITY, 1:49. ALL THREE TIMEOUTS. START FROM THE 19. FUMBLES. DOWN HE GOES. JUST SHY OVER THE 25 YARD LINE. KIRK: GOOD JOB BY ALEX SINGLETON.

JACKSON TO ABOUT MIDFIELD. THE INITIAL INDICATION IS AGAINST DENVER. >> PASS INTERFERENCE, DEFENSE, NUMBER 27. THE BALL WILL BE PLACED AT THE SPOT OF THE FOUL. KIRK: MATHIS GRABS ONTO THE JERSEY OF SKYY MOORE. ONCE HE GETS A STEP ON HIM THE WAY HE CATCHES UP AND GRABS THE JERSEY, THAT IS WHY THE BALL IS INTERCEPTED BY DENVER. AL: 24 YARD PENALTY. THAT IS KNOCKED AWAY. THAT IS MATHIS RIGHT THERE TRYING TO ATONE FOR WHAT HE JUST DID. KIRK: PAT SURTAIN IS ON THE OTHER SIDE. WHOEVER IS THE CORNER ON THE OTHER SIDE IS GOING TO BE TESTED A LOT. A LOT OF BALLS COMING HIS WAY. MAHOMES WENT TO GO AFTER 27 IN WHITE. AL: SECOND AND 10. DEEP DROP. HE DROPS IT TOO. TO MAKE IT THIRD DOWN AND 10. 1:56. 109 IN THE POCKET OF KELCE. KIRK: THIS IS THE PART OF THE OFFENSE WHERE PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN SEEING GROWING. WHERE THEY ARE TODAY VERSUS WHERE THEY ARE IN JANUARY IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. KELCE CANNOT MAKE EVERY PLAY. WE NEED TONY AND RICE AND OTHERS TO STEP UP HERE. AL: THIRD AND 10. SECONDARY DOING HIS JOB. THROW IT AWAY. WE GOT ANOTHER FLAG NOW. KIRK: LEFT TACKLE SMITH ON A HOLD. THEY WILL DECLINE THA >> THERE WERE TWO FELLOWS ON THE PLAY BOTH BY THE OFFENSE. HOLDING, NUMBER 79. THIS PENALTY IS DECLINED. INTENTIONAL GROUNDING, NUMBER 15. HE WAS OUT OF THE POCKET BUT THE BALL DID NOT REACH THE LINE OF THIS WAS A LOSS OF DOWNS AT THAT SPOT. IT IS FOURTH DOWN. AL: IT IS FOURTH DOWN AND THE PENALTY IS GOING TO MOVE THE BALL. SOMEWHERE INSIDE THE 35 YARD KIRK: YEAH, HE IS WELL OUTSIDE OF THE POCKET BUT HE IS CONSIDERABLY SHORT OF THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. HE IS MAYBE EIGHT YARDS SHORT OF THE RIGHT CALL IS MADE. FRUSTRATION FROM MAHOMES. CANNOT FIND THE RHYTHM YET WITH AL: 61 SECONDS LEFT. DENVER FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH HAS TWO TIMEOUTS. A MASSIVE BOOT TO THE SIX YARD CAUGHT THERE. AROUND THE OUTSIDE. GETS BUMPED OUT ON THE 25 YARD SO THAT KICK IS 62 AL:SAYING WILSON IS NOT THE ISSU IT IS THE DEFENSE. DESPITE KELCE HAVING A PRO BOWL FIRST HALF, THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HOLD HIM SO OFTEN. GET THE BALL BACK. 47 SECONDS LEFT. A SCREEN HERE IS SET UP. NICE RUN HERE. STEPS OUT OF BOUNDS TO STOP THE CLOCK BEHIND A LLOYD CUSHENBERRY BLOCK. FIRST DOWN AT THE 39. KIRK: SEAN PAYTON OFFENSE IS ALWAYS KNOWN FOR SCREENS AND CALLING AT THE RIGHT TIME TO GET THINGS STARTED WITH PRESSURE FROM THE CHIEFS. GOOD JOB OF GETTING IT OUT TO YOU ROD HAS THE RECEIVING RUNNING BACK. AL: KNOCKED DOWN. JAYLEN WATSON COVERING ON THE PLAY. SECOND DOWN AND 10. KIRK: WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE CHIEFS TRYING TO BUILD CHEMISTRY WITH WHAT THEY ARE DOING FROM MAHOMES. THE SAME THING CAN BE SAID OF AND THESE RECEIVERS. NEED SEPARATION. WE NEED SOME KIND OF HELP. I GOOD JOB OF WATSON COMING AROUND AND NOT INTERFERING. TIGHT COVERAGE. AL: WILSON'S OF THE OUTSIDE. HAVING TO GO DOWN IS COURTLAND SUTTON. THEY FINALLY TAKE ONE HERE. >> TIMEOUT, DENVER. THREE SUPER BOWL APPEARANCES IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. KIRK: TWO RECEPTIONS. ONE YARD. AL: WILSON. SACK. CHRIS JONES. I WAS JUST STARTING TO SAY JONES HAS HAD A QUIET NIGHT UNTIL NOW. CHRIS JONES, ONE OF THE BEST. A TON OF SACKS. EIGHT STRAIGHT GAMES WITH A KIRK:KIRK: I LOVE WHEN HE ANSWER THE QUESTION ON WHO HE LINES UP ON THIRD DOWN. HE SAID HE LOOKS AT THE HEIGHT, THE WEIGHT, WHAT YOUR THEY ARE. HE WILL MOVE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE SHOULD THEY LET HIM DO HIS THING. HE SAID ON THIRD DOWN I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE HE IS GOING TO LINE THAT TIME HE WANTED TO GO UP AGAINST MCCLATCHY. AL: RUSSELL WILSON. 500 TIME HE HAS BEEN SACKED. JONES PROVIDES THAT MILESTONE. HE HAS THE RECORD. 11 STRAIGHT GAMES WITH A SACK A COUPLE YEARS AGO. NOW HE HAS ANOTHER STRING GOING. NOW THEY HAVE A PUNT HERE. MAHOMES HAS 15 SECONDS. KIRK: AS LONG AS 87 IN RED IS GOING OUT. THEY HAVE A SHOT TO GET INTO FIELD GOAL RANGE. YOU BRING UP A GREAT POINT ABOUT VANCE JOSEPH AND HIS DEFENSE. IT FEELS LIKE IT IS 28-0. AL: IT DOES. IT IS 10. KIRK:KIRK: THEY HAVE BEEN DEEP IN DENVER TERRITORY. >> ILLEGAL TOUCH OF THE KICK BY THE KICKING TEAM BY NUMBER 37. THIS FIVE YARD PENALTY WILL BE ADDED TO THE END OF THE PLAY. AL: THAT MOVES MAHOMES EVEN CLOSER NOW. KIRK: THE ROOKIE, RILEY MOSS. CLEARLY OUT. STEPPED OUT ON HIS OWN. AL: 39 YARD LINE. THEY HAVE A TIMEOUT IF THEY NEED THEY HAVE ALL THREE. THEY CAN STOP THE CLOCK. 45 YARD LINE. 10 SECONDS AND TIMEOUT. YOU ARE RIGHT. YOU SUMMED IT UP PERFECTLY. DENVER'S DEFENSE CANNOT GET ANYTHING GOING. KIRK: THE WAY IT STARTED, IF YOU ARE A DENVER FAN YOU KNOW THERE IS A LOT HAPPENING. EVERYONE MAKES A BIG DEAL OF THE SEAN PAYTON SCRIPTS. WE SELL IT TONIGHT WITH THE FIRST SERIES. THEY WERE RUNNING THE BALL AT ABOUT SIX YARDS A CLIP ON THE FIRST DRIVE. SINCE THEN THEY HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN COMPLETELY. UP AGAINST A REALLY GOOD DEFENSE TONIGHT. AL: CHIEFS WILL GET THE BALL TO START THE SECOND HALF. MAHOMES SAID THE 42 YARD LINE. -- TED THE 42 YARD LINE. NOW HE IS GOING TO TAKE A HE IS HIT BY MCMILLAN. BUCKNER AND HIS GANG READY TO COME OUT. AT THIS POINT YOU ARE LOOKING AT ABOUT A 60 YARD FIELD GOAL. KIRK: SEE MAHOMES TALKING TO THE SECONDARY FROM DENVER. I DON'T THINK HE APPRECIATED THAT HIT. WATCH IT AS HE STARTS TO GO DOWN HERE HE TAKES THE HIT FROM MCMILLAN. YOU SEE HIM GET UP RIGHT AWAY AND LOOK AT THE REF LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON HERE. AL: A 60 YARD FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT. IT IS A SWIRLING WIND. THERE IS NO PREVAILING WIND INSIDE MOST STADIUMS. YOU HAVE FLAGS GOING IN EVERY DIRECTION. HAD A 62 YARDER HERE LAST YEAR. TOMMY TOWNSEND TO PUT IT DOWN KICK IS GOOD. AND GOODBYE PLENTY. -- ANY GOOD BY PLENTY. 13-0. COMING UP AFTER THE BREAK, THE STATE FARM HALFTIME SHOW WITH CARISSA AND THE GANG FROM KANSAS CITY. DEFENSE HAS DONE A GOOD JOB ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. MAHOMES AND COMPANY. >> SEAN PAYTON CAME HERE WELL AWARE HIS TEAM HAS NOT PLAYED WELL. HE SAID PREPARE FOR THIS OFFENSE TO OPEN IT UP A LITTLE BIT. HE SHOWED ME HIS CALL SHEET AND THAT THING WAS MARKED UP TOP OR BOTTOM. ANDY REID TOLD ME HE LIKES THE PRESSURE HIS GUYS HAVE BEEN BRINGING UP FRONT AND HE WANTS THEM TO KEEP BRINGING IT. THEY STARTED 0-3 IN THE RED ZONE. ANDY REID SAID I WILL TAKE THAT IS MY FAULT. AL: WHERE THE RARE TIMES ANDY WILL TAKE THE BLAME. YOU WILL TAKE THE BLAME BUT IT IS NOT HIS FAULT. KIRK: USUALLY THERE IS NOT ANY BLAME TO TAKE. I DO FIND VERY -- UNUSUAL AND COMFORTING WHY THIS TEAM IS WHERE THEY ARE WHEN ANDY REID WILL FALL ON HIS SWORD, MAHOMES. A BIG PART OF THE CULTURE OF THE MOST WELL-KNOWN BRANDS. ALWAYS DEFLECTING THE ATTENTION AND ACCEPTING THE BLAME. AL: CATCH IS MADE. FIRST DOWN IS MADE. PACHECO. YOU GET A COUPLE OF TEAMS. KANSAS CITY AND PHILADELPHIA. PHILADELPHIA UNDEFEATED. THE GUYS SAY WE CAN PLAY SO MUCH THAT HER. YEAH, I GUESS. 5-0 AND 4-1 IS PRETTY GOOD. KIRK: CAN YOU ENVISION THEM WHERE THEY' WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE AROUND THANKSGIVING, DECEMBER AND INTO JANUARY? ONCE THESE WERE FEES THERE' ONCE THESE WERE FEES THERE'S -- ONCE THESE RECEIVERS GET MORE REPS TOGETHER, IT IS JUST A MATTER OF TIME. AL: KEEP 87 HEALTHY. ALEX SINGLETON MAKING THE THERE IS KELCE TONIGHT. HE HAS BEEN TARGETED SEVEN TIMES. CAUGHT SEVEN. 109 YARDS. THE 40 YARDER DOWN THE RIGHT SIDELINE. KIRK: SEE IF WE GET ONE OF THOSE TRAVIS ROUTES. I LOVE THAT. BASICALLY LIKE YOU AND 15 WILL FIGURE IT OUT. AL: SURE. SEE IF WE CAN GET OPEN BY 10 SECOND AND EIGHT. LOOKS ONE WAY. COMES THE OTHER. ENOUGH TO WHERE HE PICKS UP THE KIRK: THIS IS GREAT. I AM WATCHING HIM ON HIS ROUTE. I SAID LET'S SEE IF HE FIGURES OUT NONCHALANTLY HOW TO GET OPEN. INSTEAD OF FIGURING OUT WHERE TO GET OPEN, HE TELLS MAHOMES WHERE TO GO WITH THE FOOTBALL. BASICALLY SAYS I DON'T HAVE THE LEVERAGE. THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK OUT FOR ME. WATCH WHAT HE DOES HERE AT THE TOP OF HIS ROUTE. READING THE LINEBACKERS. HE PUTS HIS RIGHT ARM LIKE LET'S GO OUT HERE. GIVE HIM AN ASSIST FOR THAT COMPLETION AND FIRST. AL: THAT IS WHAT GUYS DO ON THE STREET. NUMBER EIGHT. THE 40 YARD LINE. MAKING THE TACKLE THERE. 100 OR MORE RECEIVING YARDS. KELCE AGAINST THE RAIDERS SIX TIMES AGAINST THE BRONCOS SIX HOPKINS AGAINST THE TITANS SEVEN SOFT THROW. STAYS IN BOUNDS. BROKE AWAY FROM SURTAIN. KIRK: THIS IS AN RPO WHICH THEY RUN A LOT OF. IF HE SEES SOFT COVERAGE, HE IS GOING TO GET THE BALL OUT. IT IS WHERE TO SEE HIM GO TOWARD SURTAIN. HE FIGURES WITH HIS ACCURACY, HE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT PRETTY QUICK. THE BALL OUT THERE AND GIVES MOORE A CHANCE TO MAKE SURTAIN MISS. AL: ACTION HERE. INTENDED FOR MCKENNON. TONY WAS THERE. A LITTLE RAZZLE-DAZZLE TO NO AVAIL. NOT QUITE AS DESIGNED. IT WAS NOT EXECUTED PERFECTLY. THE DESIGN WAS FINE. KIRK: I LOVE WHEN YOU BROUGHT UP ANDY REID AND YOU SAID HOW DO YOU KEEP CALLING THESE PLAYS? HE WINKED AT US AND SAID I MAY HAVE ONE FOR YOU GUYS THURSDAY NIGHT. HE HANDS IT OFF. LARRY LINED UP AS A FULLBACK. I THOUGHT MAHOMES MIGHT BE GOING OUT FOR A PASS. AL: CAUGHT. THE ROOKIE WILL SET UP A FIRST DOWN AND GOAL. MCMILLAN STOPS HIM INSIDE THE 10 TWICE THEY HAVE GONE TO THE HE HAS CAUGHT TWO FOR 30 YARDS. KIRK: THIS IS GOING TO BE THE GOING TO EMERGE AND GET BETTER AND BETTER. HE IS VERY PHYSICAL. HE HAS GREAT ABILITY AFTER THE CATCH. NO THAT ABOUT KADARIUS TONEY. THE ROOKIE OUT OF SMU. HIS ABILITY TO PULL AWAY FROM AL: OPENING-NIGHT AGAINST DETROIT. STOPPED AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE THIS TIME. NO GAIN ON THE PLAY. SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. KIRK: VANCE JOSEPH, HIS DEFENSE HAS DONE A GOOD JOB TONIGHT IN THE RED ZONE. NOT GIVING UP A TON OF POINTS TO ONE TOUCHDOWN. CAME UP WITH A PICK AND FORCED A FIELD GOAL. ONE OF FOUR SO FAR FOR KANSAS RUN OUT, SLUNG OUT. THE CROWD ONCE A FLAG. CLOSE. YOU CAN SEE THE FRUSTRATION. SLINGS HIM OUT OF BOUNDS. KIRK:3 KIRK: ALL ONE MOTION. LOOKED LIKE IT WAS IN BOUNDS WHEN HE INITIALLY HAD CONTACT I THINK IT WAS A FOLLOW-THROUGH THROUGH THE AIR. THAT IS AN EXTENSION OF THE RUN GAME, PUTTING PACHECO OUT, THREE RECEIVERS IN FRONT OF HIM. AL: LOOKED A BIT LIKE THE WWE. [LAUGHTER] THIRD DOWN AND GOAL. MY HOMES -- MAHOMES AGAINST THE GRAIN. THEY HOLD AGAIN. NO MORE THAN A FIELD GOAL KIRK: YOUR GUY GOT OPEN AGAIN. MAHOMES IS RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE. HE SAYS YOU GOT ME COVERED, I WILL JUST GO HERE. HE'S OPEN IN THE BACK OF THE END I LOVE HOW HE NEVER GIVES UP ON A PLAY AND ALWAYS TRUST MAHOMES WITH HIS CREATIVITY WILL EVENTUALLY FIND HIM. LOOKS LIKE MAHOMES IS LOOKING AT AL: YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT CLEARLY ONE OF THE BEST TIGHT END IN -- ENDS IN HISTORY. I KNOW WE HAD A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM, BUT THIS GUY, CRAZY. 9:16 TO GO, THIHE'S HAVING A BIG AL: HE HAS BEEN THE STAR OF THE SHOW TONIGHT. KIRK: AND I REALLY THINK AS MUCH AS MAHOMES AND KELCE GET THE ATTENTION, I THINK THE DIFFERENCE AS THIS SEASON GOES ON WILL POTENTIALLY BE THIS KANSAS CITY DEFENSE. WE CAN TALK ALL WE WANT ABOUT SEAN PAYTON, RUSSELL WILSON, W HY AREN'T THEY PLAYING BETTER? THEY COME INTO A TOUGH ENVIRONMENT AGAINST A DEFENSE FEELING GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES. MANY OF THESE GUYS IN THEIR SECOND YEAR. WE KNOW ALL ABOUT WHAT CHRIS JONES CAN DO, BEEN AROUND EIGHT YEARS. THEY HAVE A GROUP THAT IS FAST, DIALED IN AND PLAYING WITH TREMENDOUS DISCIPLINE. AL: RUSSELL WILSON HANDS THE BALL OFF HERE. UNDRAFTED ROOKIE MCLAUGHLIN. KIRK: IT FEELS LIKE A LOT MORE BUT IT IS STILL A TWO POSSESSION GAME TECHNICALLY. YOU CAN SEE THE HALFTIME ADJUSTMENTS TO GET THINGS GOING IN THE SECOND HALF. A PROBLEM SPOT FOR THEM HAS BEEN THE THIRD QUARTER. HE TOLD US THIS WEEK, I HAVE BEEN STRIPPED OUT OF A FEW PLAYS TO START THE SECOND HALF. I WOULD GO BACK TO THE RUNNING THE SCREEN WORKED FOR HIM AT THE END OF THE FIRST HALF. THEY AVERAGED OVER SIX YARDS A CARRY RUN, ESPECIALLY WITH JAVONTE WILLIAMS. AL: DOWN THE LEFT SIDELINE. FLIGHT IS THROWN. WATSON MAKING CONTACT WITH THAT WILL TAKE THE BALL TO MIDFIELD. KIRK: LOOKED LIKE HE GRABBED ONTO THAT ARM. REFEREE: PASS INTERFERENCE. AUTOMATIC FIRST. KIRK: YOU LOSE THE FOOTBALL IN THE AIR AND THE RECEIVER WILL WORK HIS WAY BACK TO THE FOOTBALL AND YOU ARE IN NO MAN'S LAND. YOU WILL EITHER GIVE UP THE RECEPTION OR YOU WILL GET PASS INTERFERENCE, MOVE THE BALL TO THE 46 YARD LINE. AL: 8:30 LEFT IN THE THIRD. MACLACHLAN -- MCLAUGHLIN. 91 FOR THAT TACKLE. SECOND AND NINE. KIRK: ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I THINK THIS FRONT DOES IS THEIR ABILITY TO GET OFF THE BLOCKS AGAINST THE RUN. TALKING ABOUT JONES, HOW ABOUT THE IMPROVEMENT? HE SAID MAKE SURE YOU TALK ABOUT 51, THIS GUY HAS BEEN THE UNSUNG HERO ON THIS DEFENSIVE FRONT. AL: KNOCKED DOWN A COUPLE FLIP HERE. MCGLOCKLIN -- MCLAUGHLIN. HE GETS TAKEN DOWN JUST SHY OF THE THIRD. KIRK: SLIP SCREEN, GET THE BALL OUT, GIVE HIM A LITTLE SPACE TO WORK WITH. HAS SOME POWER, SURPRISING POWER FOR HIS SIZE. I LOVE SEAN PAYTON BROUGHT UP TO HIM GUYS HE'S WORKED WITH IN THE PAST, GUYS THAT CAN BE PART OF THAT SCREEN GAME. GET TOUGH, PHYSICAL YARDS. IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT HIS SPEED. THEY HAVE BEEN IN THESE THIRD AND SHORTS, NOT RUN THE AL: JAVONTE WILLIAMS FLANKING. HAS IT. AND BULLS AHEAD. 40 YARD LINE FOR A FIRST DOWN. KIRK: WHEN IN DOUBT, GET BEHIND THE BIG LEFT GUARD. THEY HAVE BEEN THROWING THE FOOTBALL ON, NO ONE HAS BEEN OPEN ON THESE THIRD AND SHORTS. GOOD TIGHT COVERAGE. THIS TIME THEY RELY ON THAT OFFENSIVE LINE. THE LINE, THIS LINE IS HOLDING THEIR OWN IN THIS RUNNING GAME. STILL EARLY ENOUGH IN THIS GAME, 6:30 AND A TWO POSSESSION GAME, YOU DON'T WANT TO ABANDON THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE FOOTBALL. AL: WILSON AND THE POCKET, JEUDY MAKES THE CATCH. JERRY JEUDY PULLING IT IN. BRONCOS BACK AT THEIR OWN 25. KIRK: SEAN PAYTON, THEY MOVE HIM CAME BACK TO THE RIGHT. ACTUALLY ENDS UP IN THE YOU GET A SLIP IN BEHIND AND GET MATCHED UP AGAINST THE BACK OR. THAT IS A FAVORABLE MATCHUP. AL: A HUDDLE. IN THE AIR. INTERCEPTED! THE CHIEFS DO IT AGAIN. THAT ONE AT THE LINE OF JUSTIN REID INTERCEPTED IT AND THEY TURNED IT OVER. 16-0. 5:30 TO GO IN THE THIRD. HE GETS THE TIP BY GAY AND THE INTERCEPTION BY THIS KANSAS CITY AL: MAHOMES FINDS THE MAN UNDERNEATH. CAUGHT ON THE OUTSIDE BY THE NUMBER TWO TIGHT END. SECOND DOWN. KIRK: GOT TO BE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THEY ARE PUTTING A DRIVE TO GET THERE. -- A DRIVE TOGETHER. MOVING INTO PLUS TERRITORY. SPAGS WITH A CHANGEUP GOES TO BRINGING THE EDGE PRESSURE. HE IS EMPTY. ONLY FIVE OFFENSIVE LINEMAN TO TAKE CARE OF I JUST NOT ENOUGH. AL: SECOND DOWN AND NINE. FOUR MAN RUSH. MAHOMES SPINNING AWAY. LOOK OUT FROM BEHIND. GET IT DOWN. NUMBER ZERO, JONATHON COOPER. THIRD YEAR MAN OUT OF YOUR ALMA MATER OHIO STATE,. ONE OF THOSE SEVENTH ROUND DRAFT CHOICES. YOU LOOK AT BROCK PURDY OF COURSE WHO WOULD BE NUMBER ONE. IT'S AMAZING. WE DO A GAME EVERY WEEK WITH SOMEBODY PICKED THERE. KIRK: EITHER THAT OR UNDRAFTED FREE AGENT. WE ALL GET EXCITED FOR THE DRAFT, FORGET THE THIRD DAY. YOU ARE SEEING A LOT OF GUYS NOT JUST MAKE ROSTERS, BUT GUYS THAT ARE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS. AL: THIRD DOWN AND 11. MAHOMES MAKES IT AROUND, STEPPING UP. HE' HE'S GOING TO RUN IT. CAN HE GET TO FIRST DOWN? YES HE CAN. AND OUT OF BOUNDS. A LITTLE MOVE TOWARD THE END. JERICK MCKINNON LED THE WAY. ON THIRD AND 11 HE PICKS UP 15. KIRK: HE TYPICALLY SEEMS TO SAVE BIG MOMENTS TO USE HIS LEGS AS A WEAPON. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB WITH SAFETIES BACK, TAKING AWAY THINGS FOR THE MOST PART. HE'S GOT THE UNDERNEATH THROW TO HIS RIGHT BUT INSTEAD OF THROWING TO MCKINNON, USES HIM AS A BLOCKER ON MATHIS. SUCH GOOD INSTINCT AND FIELD VISION ON THOSE THIRD DOWNS. AL: 12TH TIME THIS YEAR HE HAS SCRAMBLED FOR A FIRST DOWN. TWO YARD GAIN INTO BRONCO TERRITORY. KIRK: TEAMS FEAR HIS ARMS SO MUCH AND HIS ABILITY TO IMPROVISE THAT THEY ARE A MOST FORGETTING ABOUT HIS LEGS. THE MORE YOU WATCH THEM OVER THE YEARS, THIRD DOWN AND RED ZONE. HE DOES NOT DO IT A TON, BUT HE PICKS HIS SPOTS TO PICK UP THOSE FIRST DOWNS. RUSSELL JUST WANTS TO GET HIS HANDS BACK ON THE FOOTBALL. AL: SECOND AND EIGHT. FLIP IT OUT HERE. CLOSE TO THE FIRST. SPOTTED A LITTLE SHORT. THIRD DOWN. ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE NIGHTS FOR THE NUMBERS, GOOD. WE TALKED ABOUT IT THIS WEEK. YOU LOOK IN THE BACKFIELD NOW. THE SNAP IS GOING TO BE TAKEN. BY TONEY. THEY CHANGE IT UP AND IT DOES NOT WORK. IT WAS THIRD DOWN AND ONE AND THEY DO A LITTLE RAZZLE-DAZZLE BACK TO THE PLAYBOOK. YOU HAVE PACHECO, KELCE BACK THERE, TONEY TAKING THE SNAP. KIRK: HE PREDETERMINED WHAT TO DO IN THAT ZONE RATE. THAT IS A GIVE. HE WANTED TO KEEP IT SO BADLY THAT HE FORGOT TO READ IT PROPERLY. IT IS A FIRST DOWN, BUT INSTEAD HE RUNS RIGHT INTO BONITO, WHO HE IS READING. AL: TOMMY TOWNSEND TO PUNT. TRYING TO DEADEN IT INSIDE THE FIVE. DOES. PERFECT. A LITTLE BACKSPIN ON IT. DENVER PINNED DEEP. 1:30 TO GO IN THE THIRD, 16-7. , 121. DENVER AFTER THE TOWNSEND PUNT PINNED INSIDE THE FIVE YARD FORWARD PROGRESS FOR WILLIAMS WILL TAKE IT OUT TO ABOUT THE 2.5. KIRK: HOW GOOD ARE THESE LINEBACKERS? THE YOUNG MAN OUT OF WISCONSIN, HE CAN PLAY SO MANY SPOTS. GOOD JOB OF RECOGNIZING THAT AND GETTING INTO THE BACKFIELD. DOWNHILL, ANTICIPATING A RUN. OUTNUMBERED THAT OFFENSIVE LINE. GOOD JOB ON THAT BACKSIDE LINEBACKER. AL: SECOND AND 12. FINAL MINUTE OF THE QUARTER. WILSON ROLLING, LOOKING, KEEPING. AND DIVES FOR THE FIRST DOWN. KIRK: THAT IS A HECK OF AN EFFORT. YOU KIDDING ME? THIS POSSESSION IS CRITICAL FOR SEAN PAYTON. THEY ARE BACKED UP DEEP IN THEIR OWN TERRITORY. LOOKS LIKE YOU WILL GET SACKED. HOW ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF MIND BY THE VET TO GET THE BALL OUT OF THAT RIGHT HAND INTO THE LEFT-HAND, AND A STIFF ARM ON THE LINEBACKER? THAT IS TEXTBOOK. AL: PERFECT. GOT AWAY FROM BOLTON. NOT EASY. GOING TO RUN IT AGAIN. THAT WILL TAKE US, AFTER WE GET THE CALL ON THE PENALTY FLAG DOWN, TACKLED BY BOLTON. REFEREE: THERE IS NO FOUL ON THE IT IS SECOND DOWN. AL: SO IT WILL BE SECOND AND VERY SHORT. WHEN WE COME BACK, AS WE MOVE ON TO THE FOURTH QUARTER. THEY WILL REWIND THE CLOCK IN A SECOND. I PROMISE KIRK HERBSTREIT, KAYLEE HARTUNG. KANSAS CITY STARTING THE FOURTH, SECOND DOWN AND ONE FOR THE BRONCOS. WILSON OFF PLAY ACTION. UNDER PRESSURE. CHASED. COMES BACK THE OTHER WAY. SHORT OF THE FIRST. KIRK: HE'S TRYING TO CHANGE THE WAY THIS GAME HAS GONE FROM THEY HAD A DECENT DRIVE TO OPEN THINGS UP, NINE PLAYS, AND IT UP ON DOWNS. YOU SEE THE INTERCEPTIONS, THE FOUR PUNTS. SEAN PAYTON TRYING TO PUT A DRIVE TOGETHER WITH RUSS. HE'S GOT A DEFENSE THAT UNDERSTANDS THIS GAME AND PLAYING WITH A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE NOT JUST TONIGHT BUT ALL YEAR. AL: THIRD AND ONE. WILLIAMS THE BACK BRINGING AN EXTRA LINEMAN. AND HE GETS THE FIRST DOWN. SEAN PAYTON, THIS IS HIS 16TH YOUR COACHING FOR THE SAINTS -- YEAR COACHING FOR THE SAINTS. NEVER BEEN SHUT OUT. KIRK: YOU'RE NOT SAYING IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TONIGHT, RIGHT? AL: YOU HAVE 44 PASSING YARDS. OOF. INTO A TIDAL WAVE. KIRK: RUSS IS SCRAMBLING ON THIS DRIVE. BEEN EFFECTIVE. AL: UNDER PRESSURE, FIRES. UNDER SUCH PRESSURE TO GET RID OF IT AND SUTTON COULD NOT HOLD SECOND AND 10. YOU GOT DOWN THERE JUSTIN REID. HE W HERE IS A LOOK AT OUR NEXT GEN STATS POWERED BY AWS. A LOT OF KELCE TONIGHT WHEN HE'S HAD CHANCES TO MAKE PLAYS IN SPACE. THAT IS ONE OF HIS GREAT QUALITIES. 24 TO 25 ROUTES AGAINST ZONE. ALL EIGHT RECEPTIONS AGAINST WE TALK ABOUT THOSE TRAVIS ROUTES, WHEN HE FEELS LEVERAGED, SOFT SPOT, HE AND PATRICK MAHOMES HAVE SUCH GREAT CHEMISTRY. THAT HAS BEEN ON DISPLAY AL: SO SECOND DOWN AND 10. SCOREBOARD TELLING EVERYBODY TO GET LOUDER. AND THEY COMPLY. KIRK: YOU SEE BOLTON WALKED UP THAT IS WHY HE'S ADJUSTING THINGS. LOOKS LIKE BOLTON BACKING OUT. TRANQUILL COMING. AL: KNOCKED DOWN AGAIN. THEY DO IT AGAIN. ANOTHER BATTED PASS. TALKED ABOUT IT A COUPLE TIMES THAT IS FOUR. KIRK: THEY ARE MOVING, SHOOT THIS WAY WITH JONES, WAS SO QUICK OFF THE BALL. THAT EMPHASIS AGAINST A SHORTER RUSSELL WILSON IS KNOCK THOSE BALL DOWN -- THOSE BALLS DOWN, THOSE QUICK THROWS. GOING DEEP AND OFF THE FINGERTIPS THAT TIME OF BRANDON JOHNSON. FIRST TIME THEY THROUGH JOHNSON'S WAY TONIGHT, A GUY WHO HAS THREE TOUCHDOWN RECEPTIONS THIS SEASON. KIRK: TRYING TO GET A LITTLE SEPARATION AT THE LINE OF TIGHT COVERAGE BY WATSON. THE BEST THING HE DOES IS READ THE EYES AND ANTICIPATES THE BALL AND NOT GET AWAY. -- AND KNOCKS IT AWAY. AL: RILEY DIXON. 22. WASHINGTON HAULS IT IN. THERE IS ROOM. GOOD RUN BACK. EVERYTHING IS IMPENDING THE INFRACTION. THAT WAS A 51 YARD TO 21 YARD RUN BACK. REFEREE: HOLDING BY THE KICKING TEAM, NUMBER 44. THIS 10 YARD PENALTY WILL BE ADMEANWHILE, WHILE YOU WERE GONE I SAID HOW UNUSUAL IT WAS TO HAVE THE RECEIVING TEAM CALLED FOR THE PENALTY. IT WAS THE RECEIVING TEAM, NOT THE KICKING TEAM. SO INSTEAD OF THE BALL BEING AT MIDFIELD, WHEN WE LEFT YOU FOR THE BREAK AT THE END OF THE LEFT SEGMENT, THE BALL IS MOVED BACK. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. KIRK: WE GOT YOU. I WAS WITH YOU. I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT CALL VERY OFTEN. AL: I GOT MY PROMO CARDS FLYING AROUND IN THE WIND, BUT APART FROM THAT. HERE WE GO. SECOND AND SEVEN. SCREEN. NICE TACKLE MADE BY SINGLETON. WE CAN TELL YOU AMAZON MUSIC LIVE, BACK MIDNIGHT EASTERN TIME WITH METRO BOOMING AND OUR MAN HOSTING 2CHAINZ. WHEN THE GAME ENDS, LIVE MUSIC BEGINS. METRO BOOMING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. AL: I FLY OUT. YOU STICK AROUND FOR THAT SHOW. KIRK: DAMN RIGHT. AL: BALL IS AT THE 24. AVOIDS THE FIRST DOWN BUT NOT THE SECOND. PERKINS WAS THERE TO SLOW HIM TACKLE MADE, BACK OF THE LINE. SECOND DOWN AND 11. KIRK: IT HAS BEEN A LONG NIGHT FOR RUSS WILSON AND SEAN PAYTON, BUT THIS DEFENSE ARE PLAYING THE DEFENDING SUPER BOWL CHAMPS, YOU HELD 1-5 IN THE RED ZONE, CREATED THE TURNOVER, YOU HAVE DONE JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO KEEP YOUR TEAM IN THIS GAME TO GIVE THEM A SHOT. IT HAS NOT BEEN A GREAT YEAR FOR THIS DEFENSE. TONIGHT THEY HAVE STEPPED UP. SOMEONE WILL HAVE TO MAKE A PLAY ONE MORE TIME ON THIS SIDE OF THE BALL. AL: SECOND AND 11. GOING DEEP. OFF THE FINGERTIPS THAT TIME OF JUSTIN WATSON. OUT IN FRONT OF MATHIS, COULD NOT HOLD. AND HE IS HURT. REFEREE: TIMEOUT FOR INJURY. KIRK: RUNS A GREAT ROUTE. A LITTLE OUT AND UP AGAINST MATHIS, WHO THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GO AFTER. HE DOES A GOOD JOB OF OLAN AWAY FROM HIM. THE BALL IS PERFECTLY THROWN AND HE'S UNABLE TO COME DOWN WITH THAT IS A HUGE GAIN. ALL OF HIS WEIGHT COMES DOWN ON IT LOOKS LIKE THAT RIGHT ARM. THIRD AND 11. WATSON WAS ABLE TO WALK OFF UNDER HIS OWN POWER AFTER THAT INJURY TIMEOUT. HERE IS MCKINNON. MCKINNON ABLE TO SLIDE THROUGH, PICKED UP FOR FIRST. LEG IS STRONG. AND MCKINNON FOR THE MOMENT WILL TAKE IT TO THE 10 YARD LINE. THERE IS A FLAG ALL THE WAY KIRK: THIS IS GOING TO COME ALL THE WAY BACK AROUND THE 32 YARD AL: FORGET ABOUT ALL THAT, IT WAS THIRD AND 11. KIRK: THEY HAVE BEEN HITTING SOME SCREENS. THAT ONE HIT BIG, BUT IT WILL HAVE TO COME BACK. HERE IS THE PUSH IN THE BACK. MCMILLAN TRYING TO GET TO THE THERE IS THE BLOCK RIGHT THERE. REFEREE: RULING ON THE FIELD IS THAT THE RUNNER STEPPED OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 35 YARD LINE. DURING THE PLAY, PERSONAL FOUL, BLIND SIDE BLOCK, OFFENSE NUMBER 29. THE PENALTY WILL BE HALF THE DISTANCE FROM THE GOAL. CORRECTION, IT IS A 15 YARD PENALTY. AL: AFTER ALL THAT HE STEPS OUT OF BOUNDS ON TOP OF IT. REFEREE: CORRECTION, BLIND SIDE BLOCK WAS NUMBER 11. IT IS THIRD DOWN. AL: WE HAVE HAD A FEW CORRECTIONS ALREADY. THAT WAS THE BLIND SIDE BLOCK WE TALKED ABOUT. ON TOP OF THAT HE STEPS OUT OF BOUNDS. THE REST OF IT ALL FOR NAUGHT. YOU GET A BUNCH OF NOTHING AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THIRD AND 26. I LOVE IT WHEN THE CROWD BOOS, YOU CAN SEE IT ON THE BIG SCREEN CAN DO NO WRONG. THIRD AND SEVEN. THIRD AND 17. NOT 26. YOU HAVE A LITTLE PASS LOW, SCOOPED UP. A LITTLE SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN WAS RICE, THE ROOKIE WHO SCORED BEFORE. GOT IT TO THE END ZONE. CROWD STILL BOOIN KIRK: YOU GET A GLIMPSE OF WHAT RICE CAN DO AFTER THE CATCH. THE EXHILARATION, I THOUGHT MAYBE -- THE ACCELERATION, I THOUGHT MAYBE PACHECO WAS UP THERE. GIVING CHIEFS FANS A GLIMPSE OF WHAT IS TO COME LATER IN THE YEAR FOR THIS ROOKIE. AL: TOMMY TOWNSEND. WOBBLY KICK, SHORT. TAKES IT TO THE 40 YARD LINE. KIRK: EVERYONE WILL LOOK AT RUSSELL WILSON AND TALK ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON, PUTTING UP BIG YARDS THROUGH THE AIR. YOU WATCH THE FILM, YOU WILL SEE IT HAS BEEN TIGHT COVERAGE WITH SNEED AND COMPANY DOWNFIELD. TRENT MCDUFFIE DOING A GOOD JOB. SPAGS PUTS THESE GUYS ON ISLAND. JOSHUA WILLIAMS IS HELD UP WHEN HE'S HAD HIS CHANCES IN HIS JAYLEN WATSON. GREAT JOB ON THE BACK END. I THINK THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS DEFENSE. WILLIAMS IN HIS SECOND YEAR, WATSON IN HIS SECOND, COOK SIX, REID COMING OVER FROM HOUSTON LAST YEAR, MCDUFFIE IN HIS SECOND YEAR, FIRST ROUND HER OUT OF WASHINGTON. ALL OF THESE GUYS LOCKED IN AND NOT THINKING ABOUT SCHEME ANYMORE. AL: WILSON HAS BEEN LIMITED TO 57 YARDS ON 17 ATTEMPTS TONIGHT. GOING DEEP, FINALLY IS ABLE TO CONNECT ON A DEEP THROW TO WE HAD 57 YARDS BEFORE THAT AND PICKS UP 23 THERE. KIRK: YOU HAD TWO DEFENDERS IN THE LEFT FLAT. YOU HAVE WILLIAMS, ALSO A LINEBACKER, GAY, TWO GUYS IN THE BACKGROUND UP ON TIGHT UNDERNEATH COVERAGE, ONE OF THE FEW MISTAKES WE HAVE SEEN FROM KANSAS CITY. IT OPENED UP AN EASY THROWING WINDOW ON TOP OF THAT COVERAGE TO SUDDEN. -- TO SUTTON. AL: WILLIAMS FOR SIX. 8:40 LEFT IN THE FOURTH. KIRK: IT IS NICE TO SEE RUSSELL WILSON STRETCH THIS DEFENSE AND FINALLY HAVE AN OPEN RECEIVER. I REALLY THOUGHT COMING INTO THE NIGHT, THE WAY RUSSELL WILSON HAS BEEN PLAYING THIS SEAN PAYTON OFFENSE, HIS GREATEST STRENGTH IS THAT VERTICAL SHOT, THOSE GO BALLS OUTSIDE THE NUMBERS. KANSAS CITY IS COMPLETELY TAKING THAT AWAY TONIGHT. AL: SECOND DOWN FIVE. CHASED BY JONES. OUT OF BOUNDS. TAKES A SHOT AT THE VERY END FROM JUSTIN REID. BUT LEGAL. KIRK: GREAT JOB AGAIN. HE LOOKS LIKE HE HAS A CHANCE. CHRIS JONES IS GOING TO GET RIGHT INTO HIS FACE. HE'S ABLE TO SHAKE HIM. EYES DOWNFIELD. CHANEL FOLLOWS THE RUNNING BACK. THIS IS WHAT HE HAS DONE A LOT OF THIS YEAR. THAT BEING A LATE HIT COME OUT OF BOUNDS BY REID BUT A NO CALL. AL: WILLIAMS THE RUNNING BACK. WILLIAMS GOES INTO THE WAITING ARMS OF ONE CHRIS JONES. KIRK: BIG FELLA, HANDS, HAS GREAT LENGTH. WE ALWAYS GET EXCITED TO WATCH. WHERE IS HE GOING TO BOUNCE AROUND? HE IS A PASS RUSHER. HOW QUICK IS HE? HE IS A DEFENSIVE TACKLE AT 6'6" AND HE'S ABLE TO OLE GUARDS. IT IS NOT JUST THAT BURST OFF THE LINE. I LOVE LISTENING TO HIM AS A VETERAN TALKING ABOUT HAND PLACEMENT, READING GUARDS, AND HOW MUCH PRESSURE THEY HAVE ON THEIR HANDS. AL: WILSON ON THE OUTSIDE. TO THE 22 YARD LINE GOES MCGLOCKLIN -- GOES MCLAUGHLIN. JONES IS A BIT OF A GOURMET. WE MET A FEW YEARS AGO. A GOURMET MEAL AT HIM WAS LIKE MOTHER CLUCKERS. KIRK: FIRST THING YOU WANTED TO KNOW IS WHERE IS THE BEST STEAKHOUSE? HE HAS A HIGH BAR. AL: YES HE DOES. KIRK: THAT PLACE IS OK. VERY ARTICULATE. AL: NICE GUY. THIRD DOWN AND FIVE. EVERYBODY COMING. JAILBREAK. PASS THROWN. A LITTLE UNDERTHROWN. JEUDY IS THERE. COVERING ON THE PLAY IS MCDUFFIE. FLAG IS DOWN. MIKE EDWARDS CAME IN FROM THE SAFETY SPOT TO PUT THE HEAT ON. THEY SENT EVERYBODY ON THAT ONE. REFEREE: ROUGHING THE PASSER, DEFENSE NUMBER 21. IT IS FIRST DOWN. AL: IT WAS EDWARDS. KIRK: THEY BROUGHT BOLTON. THEY GET PRETTY EXOTIC. HE'S ABLE TO SHOOT THROUGH THE GAP. IT IS NOT TO HIT, BUT IS IT TO FOLLOW THROUGH? IS THAT THE CALL? TERRY: LOOKS LIKE AT THE END HE MIGHT LAND WITH ALL HIS BODY WEIGHT QUARTERBACK. IT'S RIGHT ON THE EDGE. THEY ARE GENERALLY GOING TO CALL THAT. HE NEEDS TO BRACE HIMSELF OR GET TO THE SIDE. AL: YOU SAW ANDY, RIGHT ON THE EDGE. THAT WAS THE RIGHT RESPONSE PERINE IS THE BACK. CAN'T GET A FIRST DOWN WITHOUT A FROM THE 11. IN THE CORNER OF THE END ZONE. COURTLAND SUTTON LOOKING AROUND, SAYING, HEY, WAIT A SECOND. TERRY: IT WAS GOING TO COME DOWN TO THE NEAR FOOT. WATCH HIS RIGHT FOOT AND SEE IF HE HAS POSSESSION. HE STILL HAS POSSESSION. LEFT FOOT DOWN. DOES HE BOBBLE THE BALL? LOOKED LIKE HE POSSESSED THAT. THAT LOOKS LIKE A TOUCHDOWN TO ME. TERRY: IT IS. IT IS THE KNEE THAT COMES DOWN. HE GETS CONTROL THERE, THEN THE KNEE COMES DOWN IN BOUNDS AND HE MAINS CONTROL. THIS IS A TOUCHDOWN. AL: YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CHALLENGE OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE TH REFEREE: DENVER IS CHALLENGING THE RULE ON THE FIELD OF AN INCOMPLETE PASS. AL: SOME PLAY. WELL, WELL, WELL. SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE COME A TWO POITHEY HAVE USED ONE CHAL AL: THE TOUCHDOWN ESSENTIALLY THE WAY WE SAW IT IS CALLED. WE CAN TELL YOU BEFORE WE WENT TO BREAK IT WAS A TOUCHDOWN. KIRK: THE BIG THING IS THE BALL WAS NOT JUGGLING THE FOOTBALL, HE HAD CLEAR POSSESSION OF IT WHEN HIS KNEE TOUCHDOWN. AL: A TWO POINT TRY TO MAKE IT AN EIGHT POINT GAME. FROM THE TWO. AND HE GOES FOR THE CONVERSION. SO AT 6:07, KANSAS CITY SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES, BUT THE DENVER DEFENSE ABLE TO HOLD THEM EXCEPT ONE TIME. KIRK: THEY GOT A CHANCE. GREAT BLOCK WORKING DOWN THIS DOUBLE-TEAMED. YOU GET A BLOCK HERE, OPENS UP VERY NICELY. GOOD JOB BY THE CENTER. THEY ARE ABLE TO CLIMB BACK TO THE BACKER WILLIE GAY. YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF PASS PLAY YOU COME UP WITH, BUT THE WAY THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTROL THINGS FOR THE MOST PART UPFRONT, THIS RUN GAME HAS BEEN SOMETHING THEY CAN RELY ON. THAT TIME WITH A LOT ON THE LINE TO MAKE IT A ONE POSSESSION GAME, THEY ARE ABLE TO GET A GOOD PUSH. AL: THEY RUN THE BALL 23 TIMES, THAT IS FIVE YARDS PER CARRY. HERE IS THE ROUGHING THE PASSER. KIRK: THAT IS THE BIG CALL. ALWAYS -- ALL HIS WEIGHT COMING DOWN ON THE QUARTERBACK, ENDED UP GIVING DENVER MORE OF AN OPPORTUNITY. SUTTON WITH THAT GREAT CATCH TO GET ON THE BOARD. AL: PENALTY ON EDWARDS. MAHOMES GOES TO WORK FROM THE PRIME VIDEO'S MOST-WATCHED DOCUMENTARY OF ALL TIME IN THE U.S., KELCE, NOW STREAMING ON PRIME VIDEO. FOLLOW THEM THROUGH THE MOST EPIC YEAR OF THEIR LIVES CULMINATING IN A SUPER BOWL SHOWDOWN FOR THE AGES. GREAT GAME WON BY KANSAS CITY OVER PHILADELPHIA. AND OF COURSE LOOKING ON IS HIS -- WELL, AT THE MOMENT, HIS GOOD BUDDY AND GIRLFRIEND. TAYLOR SWIFT. HE MAKES A CATCH. GAIN OF THREE. KELCE NOW IS STILL DOWN AND WILL HOBBLE BACK TO THE THAT ANKLE WAS INJURED. IT'S NOT A HIGH ANKLE. THEY CALL IT A REGULAR LOW ANKLE SPRAIN. KIRK: THAT IS THE THING WITH ANGLES, YOU ARE TRYING TO PUSH OFF. SINGLETON TO WRAP UP AROUND THAT ANKLE. IT IS PLAYS LIKE THIS WITH THE SCAR TISSUE THAT IT SETS YOU BACK, ALWAYS LINGERING. AL: SECOND AND SEVEN. BLITZ. GETS AWAY, AS HE NORMALLY DOES. MAKES A THROW. IS BUMPED OUT OF BOUNDS. JONATHON COOPER ON THE HELMET. THIRD AND TWO. KIRK: THE QUARTERBACK 40 YARDS DOWNFIELD DOES THE PUMP FAKE. DEFENSE WILL FALL FOR IT. KELCE WILL COME BACK OUT ON THE GOOD TO SEE THAT HE'S FEELING ALL RIGHT. GOOD FOR KANSAS CITY CONSIDERING NINE TIMES OUT OF 10 YOU ARE LOOKING TO GET HIM THE BALL. AL: MAHOMES HAS THROWN NINE TIMES, COMPLETED EVERY ONE OF THEM. THROWS. RICE TO THE 40 YARD LINE. JACKSON IS THERE SAVING THE TD. 28 YARDS. KIRK: WATCH HIM AFFECT SINGLETON, USING HIS EYES TO MOVE HIM TOWARDS KELCE. THEY ARE GOING TO KELCE A LOT AND HE MOVES 49 AND IT OPENS UP A NICE PASSING LANE TO GET THE BALL BACK TO RICE. AL: GOT THE EYES GOING, THE TONGUE GOING, THE WHOLE THING. LOVE THE WAY HE SURVEYS. INSIDE TO PACHECO. THREADS HIS WAY TO THE 35 YARD SECOND AND SIX, CHEWING UP A BIT OF TIME AS WELL. EACH TEAM HAS USED ALL OF ITS TIMEOUTS. PACHECO OUT. KIRK: HE CAN'T GET HIS HELMET SITUATED. AL: EDWARDS-HELAIRE COMES IN. STILL PLENTY OF TIME. PLAY CLOCK AT -- 24 YARD LINE. TACKLE MADE, MOORE MAKING THE GRAB. MATHIS MAKES THE STOP. KIRK: LOOK AT OUR NEXT GEN STATS POWERED BY AWS WITH MY HOLMES THROWING THE FOOTBALL -- WITH MAHOMES THROWING THE FOOTBALL 10 87 YARDS UNDER 10. A LOT OF THEM TONIGHT AGAINST HE'S HAD TO GO UNDERNEATH. THAT HAS BEEN A THEME FOR HIM. NEED TO BE PATIENT. THIS DENVER DEFENSE HAS PROVEN TO BE A HANDFUL FOR KANSAS CITY, ESPECIALLY FINISHING OFF DRIVES. THEY JUST CAN'T PUT IT IN THE END ZONE. AL: DENVER TAKES A TIMEOUT TO STOP THAT CLOCK, 3:04. THEY HAVE TWO PLUS THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING. KANSAS CITY CLEARLY IN FIELD GOAL RANGE RIGHT NOW. MAHOMES HAS NOW THROWN FOR 305 WE STARTED TO SAY BEFORE, WITH MAHOMES, UNLESS HE HAS A PERFECT PASSER RATING, HE IS OK. ANYTHING BUT PERFECT TONIGHT. KIRK: HAD TO BATTLE TONIGHT. AL: 29-35. 305. RUNS THE BALL FOR 33 YARDS AS WELL. NICE TACKLE COMING UP, SIMMONS. TIMEOUT TAKEN BY DENVER. 2:58. KIRK: GREAT TO SEE JUSTIN SIMMONS BACK IN THIS LINEUP. WAS BACK LAST WEEK. THIS IS WHAT HE'S REALLY KNOWN FOR, HIS RANGE IN THE PAST GAME. WITH THE EXPERIENCE HE HAS, HOW QUICKLY HE'S BEEN ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THINGS AND GET INVOLVED IN RUN SUPPORT, EAT YOUR OUT OF BOSTON COLLEGE. TAKES AWAY THAT SPACE. -- EIGHT YEAR OUT OF BOSTON COLLEGE. NO CHANCE TO GET THAT STARTED. AL: SECOND DOWN AND 11. KIRK: KANSAS CITY, ALL THEY NEED IS A FIELD GOAL. THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT EATING UP CLOCK AND TRYING TO MAKE THIS A TWO POSSESSION GAME. AL: A LITTLE FLIP HERE. TONEY, HE GETS DUMPED AT THE 24. THEY HAVE THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING AND ONE TIMEOUT. THEY ARE GOING TO SAVE THAT. RIGHT HERE. AND OF COURSE, KANSAS CITY WILL LET THE CLOCK RUN DOWN AS CLOSE AS THEY CAN TO ABOUT 2:15. THERE IS BUTKER. HE HAS ALREADY KICKED A 60 YARDER TONIGHT. AL: MAHOMES IS SACKED BACK AT THE 36 YARD LINE. ZACH ALLEN CAME CRASHING THROUGH. THE FOURTH DOWN MAKES IT A -- AN EASY FIELD GOAL MORE PROBLEMATIC. RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE A 50 YARD FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT AND IF HE MAKES IT IT WOULD BA.2 POSSESSION GAME. -- IT WOULD BE A TWO POSSESSION BUTKER BANGS THAT ONE DEAD DOWN THE MIDDLE@ THE MIDDLLE! KIRK: WHAT A WEAPON. ONE POSSESSION, LATE IN THE GAME AND YOU NEED POINTS. MAHOMES WITH A RARE MISTAKE TAKING THAT SACK. MR. AUTOMATIC PUTS IT RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE. AL: FOUR FIELD GOALS TONIGHT. 52 YARDS. YOU KNOW, THE DENVER DEFENSE, NO ONE HAS TAKEN MORE HEAT THAN FRIENDS JOSEPH. TO COME IN HERE AND ALLOW ONE TOUCHDOWN AND MAKE FOUR FIELD GOALS MAKING A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE. KIRK: THE RED ZONE ALONE IS WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO KEEP THEM IN THE GAME. ONE TOUCHDOWN OUT OF FIVE ATTEMPTS. THEY GAVE UP SOME YARDS BUT SQUEEZED THEM WHEN THEY HAD TO. I UNDERSTAND THAT DENVER IS WHEN YOU ARE BUILDING THIS THING FROM THE GROUND UP, IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME ALL THE WAY BACK TO 2016 SINCE THEY HAVE HAD A WINNING SEASON. I THINK IT SHOWS YOU WHAT JOSEPH AND THIS DEFENSE IS CAPABLE OF AL: THEY HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN TO THE PLAYOFFS SINCE THEN. KIRK: THIS IS HOW THEY ENDED UP GETTING THE PRESSURE. THEY WALK SO MANY DEFENDERS UP. SEVEN GUYS ARE UP CLOSE. THEY MUG AND THEN DROP AND CONFUSE THE OFFENSIVE LINE. ZACH ALLEN PLAYED IN ARIZONA WITH J.J. WATT. HE KIND OF LOOKS LIKE HIM THERE IN HIS UNI. AL: DENVER HAS ONE TIMEOUT. FROM THE 25. WILSON OVER THE MIDDLE AND IT IS BROKEN UP AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE. RIGHT AT MIDFIELD. MIKE EDWARDS WAS THERE. KIRK: SPECS CAME OUT AND TALKED WITH THE MEDIA ABOUT HOW HE HAS APPRECIATED THIS GUY COMING OVER FROM TAMPA AND HE HAS VERSATILITY. THE BALL IS WELL THROWN. HE DOES NOT SEE THE BALL BUT NOW HE DOES ANY FIGHTS THROUGH HIS ARMS TO DISLODGE THE FOOTBALL. GREAT PLAY. THREE-MAN RUSH. A FLOATER IS CAUGHT. THE BALL IS OUT! AND KANSAS CITY HAS IT! TRENT MCDUFFIE KNOCKED IT OUT. GAY TAKES IT INTO THE END ZONE FOR THE CELEBRATION. ENDING DENVER'S VERY FAIN HOPES. KIRK: THIS DEFENSE WILL BE DOING THIS TO A LOT OF TEAMS THIS THIS BACKEND IS FLYING TO THE IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT COVERAGE. MCDUFFIE IS A SECOND-YEAR PLAYER OUT OF WASHINGTON. GREAT PLAY OUT IN SPACE. HE BRINGS BAD INTENTIONS WITH AL: THEY CAN RUN IT OUT RIGHT NOW. AN 11 POINT DIFFERENCE, A VERY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER TWO A FEW OF OUR FRIENDS SINCE GAMES DON'T END WITH 10.5 IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HERE WE ARE NEXT WEEK, JAGUARS AND SAINTS. SOME OF OUR FRIENDS ARE WONDERING WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. BOTH TEAMS COMING HAVE WINNING RECORDS. KIRK: A LITTLE FOOD FOR THOUGHT. CHIEFS NEXT WEEK. CHARGERS AT DENVER. MIAMI. THINK ABOUT THIS, HOW BIG THIS IS. THE BILLS COMING UP WITH HOME-FIELD ADVANTAGE FOR KANSAS CITY WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE BIG DIFFERENCE. WHETHER IT IS BUFFALO OR PLAYING HERE IN ARROWHEAD. AL: WORD HAS JUST COME DOWN THAT TAYLOR SWIFT HAS WRITTEN A FEW SONGS FOR US INCLUDING PIGSKIN LOVE STORY. WE COVER THE WORLD HERE. KANSAS CITY WINNING ITS LAST 16 REGULAR-SEASON GAMES AGAINST THE DENVER BRONCOS. DATING BACK TO THE ROCKIES. THEY GAVE IT A BATTLE. THE DEFENSE ALLOWED ONLY ONE TD OUT OF KANSAS CITY AND THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN OFTEN. SEAN PAYTON STILL HAS NOT BEEN SHUT OUT IN 16 SEASONS. TWO VETERAN COACHES EXCHANGING PLEASANTRIES. KELCE A GREAT NIGHT WITH NINE CATCHES TO 124. 80 AND 20 IS HIS LIFETIME RECORD, MAHOMES. AL: ALL RIGHT, HANG AROUND. THE POST GAME SHOW, THE JCPENNEY POST GAME SHOW COMING UP RIGHT AFTER THESE MESSAGES.
