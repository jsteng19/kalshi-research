GREEN BAY. JARED GOFF CAME OVER IN THAT TRADE WITH THE RAMS PRIOR TO THE 2021 SEASON. FORD FIELD PACKED TO THE GILLS AS YOU WOULD EXPECT. GREEN BAY WON THE TOSS. THEY DEFER, AND THE LIONS WOULD GET THE BALL. BRANDON McMANUS TO KICK IT OFF. TAKING A YARD THE END ZONE, AND DOWN TO THERE. SO HERE THEY COME. AND JARED GOFF HAVING A TREMENDOUS YEAR, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE MVP RACE. OF COURSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SAQUON BARKLEY. WHO ELSE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT TOO? ALLEN, JOSH ALLEN. >> Kirk: JOSH ALLEN AND JARED GOFF, SUCH A GREAT YEAR IN THIS SYSTEM. >> Al: EVEN THOUGH BALTIMORE HAS HAD ITS PROBLEMS, LAMAR JACKSON, HIS NUMBERS WOULD PUT HIM IN THAT CONVERSATION AS WELL. >> Kirk: GREAT RACE THIS YEAR. >> Al: START WITH DAVID MONTGOMERY AS RUNNING BACK. GO BACK AND FORTH AND HIM AND JAHMYR GIBBS. AND START WITH THE FULL BACK AS WELL. KEEP IT ON THE GROUND. AND IT'S A 2-YARD PICKUP HERE ON FIRST DOWN. P.J. SLAYTEN THE TACKLE. 2nd AND 8. MATCHUP AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE WITH THE PACKERS THAT SEEMS TO BE GETTING BETTER EACH WEEK WITH THE SYSTEM HAFLEY BROUGHT IN. AND RIGHT NOW PLAYING WITH FOUR D-LINEMEN IN THIS NEW 4-3 SCHEME. PLAYING MUCH BETTER AGAINST THE LINE IN RECENT WEEKS. >> Al: QUICK PASS, OUT TO THE 37. AMON-RA ST. BROWN MAKES THE GRAB, HIS 77th CATCH OF THE ISAIAH MAKES THE TACKLE. >> Kirk: BEN JOHNSON COORDINATOR ONE OF THE HOT NAMES LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR AS FAR AS FUTURE HEAD COACHES. HE AND GOFF, THE CONNECTION THEY HAVE. THE COMMAND GOFF HAS ESPECIALLY IN THESE SITUATIONS AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. >> Al: ST. BROWN IN MOTION. LOOKING THAT WAY IS GOFF. THROWING THAT WAY IS FIRST DOWN. BACK-TO-BACK RECEPTIONS FOR ST. BROWN. RECOVERING ON THE PLAY. >> Kirk: THIS IS THE THING THAT THIS LIONS OFFENSE IS KNOWN FOR, THE MOVEMENT. HOW DO YOU GET 14 OPEN? WELL, YOU MOVE HIM. EXPECTING HIM TO GET INVOLVED. THEY WANT TO GET HANDS ON HIM. YOU CAN'T. WHEN YOU MOVE HIM, YOU CAN SEE THAT SOFT COVERAGE THERE ALLOWS HIM TO GET UP AND OUT. BULLARD DOESN'T HAVE ANY CHANCE, AND THERE'S THE ACCURACY, OF COURSE, FROM GOFF. >> Al: PLAY ACTION. FIRED OVER THE MIDDLE, AND ST. BROWN WAS THERE, COULD NOT HOLD ON. COVER ON THE PLAY BY KEISEAN NIXON. >> Kirk: THE ACCURACY, THE FANS WANTED THAT RIGHT ARM LEANING OVER THE TOP OF SAINT BROWN AND A CALL TO BE MADE, BUT THAT IS PERFECTLY EXCOO UTED MANNED COVERAGE THERE BY THE CORNER NIXON. >> Al: NOW YOU'VE GOT WILLIAMS WITH BROWN ON THE RIGHT SIDE. 2nd AND 10 FROM THE 42. WILLIAMS GOES IN KEEP IT ON THE GROUND, MONTGOMERY, FIRST DOWN IN THE GREEN BAY TERRITORY. TACKLED BY McKINNEY. >> Kirk: THIS IS WHAT MONTGOMERY BRINGS TO THE TABLE WITH THESE TWO BACKS. YOU'LL SEE THE RIGHT GUARD 71 AND 87 PULL AROUND. BUT THE PACKERS TO THEIR CREDIT THEY BLOW THIS PLAY UP. I MEAN CLAY WALKER GETS DOWN THERE, BUT PHYSICALITY. WILLIAMS BLOCK OUT THERE ON THE CORNER SPRUNG HIM FREE, BUT THE PACKERS DID EVERYTHING THEY WANTED TO DO THERE TO DEFEND THAT. BUT THE BALANCE AND THE STRENGTH OF THE BACK, MONTGOMERY, GETS HIM OUT IN THE OPEN. >> Al: NOW, JAHMYR GIBBS COMES IN. HE'S 27 YARDS SHY OF 1,000. MAKES THE GRAB, ON THE MOVE, TACKLED AT THE 38 YARD LINE. HE CAN RUN, CAN CATCH. BULLARD MAKES THAT >> Kirk: HOW GREAT IS IT? IT'S THE BEST TANDEM OF BACKS IN THE NFL. WE ALREADY SAW MONTGOMERY WHAT HE CAN DO WITH THE POWER TO SHAKE FREE. THEN YOU BRING GIBBS IN, KEEPS BOTH THESE GUYS FRESH. HE GETS OUT INTO OPEN FIELD AND IS SO DANGEROUS. THAT TIME HE DIDN'T HAVE A TIME TO USE LINEMEN AND STILL PICKS UP POSITIVE YARDS. COMES BACK IN. AGAIN A SHORT DROP, QUICK THROW, AND IT'S WILLIAMS AT THE FIRST DOWN MARKER BUT JAMESON WILLIAMS CAN'T HOLD ON. IT'LL BE 3rd DOWN AND 3. >> Kirk: WITH EDGERRIN COOPER OUT, MONTGOMERY JUST A LITTLE BIT LATE IN GETTING UP THERE AND McDUFFIE ABLE TO EFFECT THAT. STILL HE GOT IT OFF. GOOD COVERAGE DOWNFIELD. >> Al: OPENING DRIVE OF THE GAME, THIRD PLAY HERE. 3rd DOWN AND 3. HANGS IN THE POCKET, FIRES, WILLIAMS OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 10 YARD JAMESON WILLIAMS. >> Kirk: THEY'VE BEEN PLAYING A LOT OF ZONE. HERE ON THIRD DOWN THEY GO MAN-TO-MAN. IT'S A TOUGH MATCHUP. ONCE YOU'RE ABLE TO -- THIS IS SPEEDSTER, AND THIS IS BULLARD WHO IS PLAYING NICKEL, TOUGH MATCHUP FOR HIM. YOU CAN SEE THE SEPARATION. AND HOW ABOUT GOFF HERE, WORKING THROUGH HIS PROGRESSIONS? THIS IS REALLY WHERE HE HAS GROWN. ONCE HE HAS THE TIME TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS THROW, HE SETS THOSE FEET, AND IT IS RIGHT ON THE MONEY FOR ANOTHER FIRST DOWN IT'S 2-2 NOW ON THIRD >> Al: AND RIGHT AT THE 10, SO IT'S 1st AND GOAL. TO THE OUTSIDE GOES GIBBS, AND WE'LL SEE OUR FIRST FLAG OF THE NIGHT. IN FACT, TWO COMES IN ON THE SAME PLAY AS HE PUSHED OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 11 YARD LINE. LEFT TACKLE SKIPPER WHO'S IN FOR TAYLOR DECKER, HE'S A BIG PHYSICAL GUY THAT TIME. HE LOST LEVERAGE AND HAD TO GRAB ONTO THE PACKERS. >> Al: DETROIT ALREADY WALKING BACK. DOING DOUBLE DUTY THIS WEEK. HE REFFED A MONDAY NIGHT GAME. SO WORKING ON TWO DAYS REST. HERE HE IS. >> Referee: HOLDING OFFENSE NUMBER 70, 10-YARD PENALTY. >> Kirk: WATCH HIM. HE GETS BOTH HIS HANDS ON HIM, SEES THE BALL GOING TO THE OUTSIDE. NOW HE'S ABLE TO GET TOUT THERE AND HE CANNOT BECAUSE OF THAT GRAB THERE BY DAN SKIPPER. GOOD CALL THERE BY THE OFFICIAL. >> Al: AGAIN, MINUS TAYLOR DECKER, THE GREAT LEFT TACKLE. SKIPPER'S BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE DETROIT ORGANIZATION LIKE FOUR TIMES ALREADY IN HIS CAREER. BACK AND FORTH HE GOES. MONTGOMERY AND GIBBS BOTH IN THE GAME. OFF THE FAKE. GIBBS MAKES THE CATCH. WORKS HIS WAY TO THE 13 YARD LINE. McDUFFIE. IT'LL BE 2nd DOWN AND GOAL FOR THE LIONS. >> Kirk: WHEN THEY DRAFTED HIM OUT OF ALABAMA, I NEVER TRY TO PUT THIS PRESSURE ON HIM TO BE THE NEXT CHRISTIAN McCAFFREY, BUT HE REMINDS YOU OF THAT KIND OF SKILL SET AS FAR AS HIS ABILITY TO RUN. HE'S A THREE DOWN BACK. AND NOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWO BACKS HERE IN MONTGOMERY, YOU'RE ABLE TO GET HIM AND KEEP HIM FRESH FOR FOUR QUARTERS AND HOPEFULLY THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE YEAR. YOU CAN ALREADY SENSE THEY WANT TO GET HIM IN SPACE EVERY WEEK BUT ESPECIALLY HERE TONIGHT AGAINST THE >> Al: EXTRA PRESSURE, QUICK THROW. CAUGHT AT THE 7 YARD LINE. TAKING IT IN THERE IS SAM LaPORTA, HAD A TREMENDOUS ROOKIE 11th PLAY OF THE DRIVE COMING IN RIGHT NOW. 3rd DOWN AND GOAL. >> Kirk: THEY'RE SIXTH IN THE NFL, BUT THEY HAVE HAD SOME ISSUES IN SOME GAMES. LAST WEEK 2-5 IN A RED ZONE. SO AGAINST JORDAN LOVE AND THIS PACKERS OFFENSE, THEY NEED TOUCHDOWNS DOWN HERE. >> Al: ON 3rd AND GOAL. JOSH SURVEYS, FIRES TOO HIGH. PUT A FLAG IN THE END INTENDED FOR TIM PATRICK, FORMER DENVER BRONCO. MISSED A COUPLE OF YEARS HAVING TWO SURGERIES. WILLIAMS WAS COVERING ON THE PLAY. GET THE CALL HERE FROM HUSSEY 3rd AND GOAL. >> Kirk: WHAT I SAW WAS THE TOM OF THE ROUTE. AT THE TOP OF THE ROUTE HE GRABBED ONTO THE SHOULDER PAD, ONTO THE JERSEY. IT WASN'T AT THE END YOU COULD SAY, HEY, INTERFERENCE. LET'S SEE HERE TOP OF THE ROUTE HE GETS A LITTLE HANDSY. WATCH HIM WORK TO OUR RIGHT AND GRABS ONTO THAT JERSEY, SLOWS HIM DOWN ENOUGH FOR THE OFFICIAL TO CALL THAT. >> Referee: PRIOR TO THE PASS ILLEGAL CONTACT DEFENSE. >> Kirk: YEAH, GET A LITTLE CLARIFICATION HERE. CORRECTION. THERE'S ONLY ONE FOUL PRIOR TO THE PASS, ILLEGAL CONTACT, DEFENSE. PENALTY'S HALF OF THIS IS THE FULL. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. THAT'S WHAT HE'S REFERRING TO. THE BALL WAS NOT YET IN THE AIR WHEN HE MADE THAT CONTACT. I TALKED ABOUT IT WASN'T NEAR THE END WHERE A LOT OF TIMES IT WAS AN ILLEGAL CONTACT CALL, AND THE BALL HAD NOT YET LEFT THE HAND OF GOFF, SO THEY CATCH A BREAK THERE ON THIRD DOWN. >> Al: HALF THE DISTANCE, JUST INSIDE THE 4. 1st AND GOAL. INTO THE END ZONE! WALKING IN, DAVID MONTGOMERY FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. PACKERS WON THE TOSS, DEFERRED, AND DETROIT SAYS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> Kirk: WELL, WHAT A DRIVE, WHAT A WAY TO OPEN THIS UP IN DETROIT. LOVE KNOWS WHAT HE'S FACING HERE TONIGHT. 3rd AND 2, 3rd AND 3, 3rd AND GOAL, ABLE TO KEEP THAT DRIVE ALIVE. AND WHEN IN DOUBT YOU GET IN THAT AREA, GET BEHIND 58, THE RIGHT TACKLE, SULE, AND A HECK OF A LOT FROM TIM PATRICK, THE RECEIVER AS WELL. >> Al: 12th RUSHING TOUCHDOWN OF THE SEASON FOR DAVID MONTGOMERY. JAKE BATES FOR THE POINT AFTER. A NICE JOB ON THAT SNAP. GETTING IT DOWN, PICK IS GOOD. BROADCAST BUT REALLY A TURNING POINT AFTER A 1466 START. THAT FOLLOWED UP A THREE, 13-1 FIRST YEAR FROM DAN CAMPBELL. IN FACT, KANSAS CITY HAS WON THE MOST. >> Al: EXACTLY. 31-8 THE RECORD SINCE THEY TURNED THINGS MEANWHILE, GREEN BAY WILL START ITS DRIVE FROM THE 30 YARD LINE AFTER THE LIONS HAD GOT 11 PLAYS, 70 YARDS IN A LITTLE OVER FIVE MINUTES. JORDAN LOVE, 11 PICKS. HE HAD ONE IN EACH OF THE FIRST EIGHT GAMES. KIRK COUSINS HAS 13. HE TOOK THE LEAD DUBIOUSLY WITH A POOR PICK PERFORMANCE LAST WEEK AGAINST THE CHARGERS. LOVE WHO STARTED THIS SEASON HURT ON OPENING DAY IN BRAZIL, MISSED TWO GAMES, HAS HAD A GROIN ISSUE AS WELL, APPEARS TO BE TOTALLY HEALTHY RIGHT NOW. >> Kirk: YEAH, FROM THE BYE-WEEK ON THE LAST THREE GAMES TO REALLY THE JORDAN LOVE YOU EXPECT TO SEE. >> Al: TO JOSH JACOBS AND WHAT A YEAR HE IS HAVING. OFF THE PLAY FAKE. UNDER PRESSURE. LOOK OUT. SACKED AT THE 23 YARD PLAY ACTION, THAT DOESN'T WORK. AND YOU'VE GOT SMITH CRAWLING HIS WAY WITH JAMAL ADAMS WHO JUST JOINED THE TEAM THREE DAYS AGO ALSO IN. BIG STORY LINE. BECAUSE THE RIGHT TACKLE A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED THERE. ZACH TOM, FREED UP SMITH TO GET OUT ON THE EDGE. WITH HUTCHINSON DOWN, THIS DETROIT DEFENSE HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR PRESSURE IN SMITH NOW IN JUST FIVE GAMES ALREADY HAS THREE SACKS TO HELP HIM OUT. >> Al: 2nd AND 17. PRESSURE. HE'S GOING TO RUN WITH IT. TRIPPED UP AT THE 31-YARD LINE. TRIPPED UP THERE BY JACK CAMPBELL IN HIS SECOND YEAR. CAMPBELL HAS THE GREEN DOT, WHICH MEANS HE CALLS THE DEFENSIVE SIGNALS. IT'LL BE 3rd DOWN. >> Kirk: THIS GAME HAS THE FEELING. WITH AARON GLENN WE TALKED IN THE OPEN WHAT A JOB HE'S DONE. 13 GUYS ON AR, THREE MORE DOWN TONIGHT. SIGNING FOUR PLAYERS THIS WEEK. JUST TRYING TO FIND BODIES THAT ARE HEALTHY. IMAGINE SOME OF THOSE GUYS LIKE YOU MENTION, JAMAL ADAMS ALREADY OUT THERE, HE'S BEEN OUT HERE FOUR DAYS. >> Al: AND STARTING TONIGHT, 3rd DOWN AND 9. EXTRA PRESSURE AGAIN. LOVE THROWS. INCOMPLETE. LOOKING FOR A FLAG, AND THERE IS A FLAG. JAYDEN REED, THE INTENDED RECEIVER. BRYAN BRANCH COVERING ON THE PLAY AND THERE'S A FLAG UPFIELD. >> Kirk: THESE LIONS BECAUSE THEY PLAY SO MUCH MANNED COVERAGE, THEY'VE BEEN CALLED FOR A LOT OF DEFENSIVE HOLDINGS AND PI'S A LOT THIS >> Referee: DEFENSE NUMBER 32. >> Kirk: YOU LIVE ON AN ISLAND, AND BRANCH IS GOOD WHEN HE'S NEAR THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. 32, HE GIVES HIM A CUSHION. 32, LEVERAGE, AND HE GETS TURNED. ONCE HE GETS TURNED, HE'S BEATEN, USES THAT LEFT HAND TO GROOB ONTO HIM, AND OFFICIALS AGAIN, ALL OVER WITH IT WITH THE RIGHT CALL. >> Al: THEY LEAD THE LEAGUE WITH DEFENSE PASS INTERFERENCE CALLS. THAT'S THEIR 16th OF THE SEASON. LOOKING FOR ROOM NOW, FINDING NONE. JOSH JACOBS CAME OVER AS A FREE AGENT AFTER PLAYING WITH THE RAIDERS. STOPPED THERE BY McNEILL. >> Kirk: WITH THESE INJURIES YOU NEED GUYS TO STEP UP. D.J. READER IS DOWN TONIGHT. YOU PUT D.J. READER AND McNEILL THAT'S AS GOOD AS THERE IS IN DEFENDING THE RUN. AND 54 IN THAT PLAY MAKES A FUROEKS S TACKLE THROWING A BLOCKER AND MAKING A PLAY AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. NOW HE GETS HELPED OFF. >> Al: YEAH, HE GETS HELPED OFF BECAUSE THEY TOOK A LOOK AND SAID TAKE HIM OUT FOR THIS PLAY. >> Kirk: WATCH HOW PHYSICAL HE GETS. THIS GUY IS STRONG, PUSHES HIM, MAYBE HOLDS ON. BUT THAT POWER HE HAS, A REALLY GOOD LOOK FROM BEHIND TO SEE HE GETS RID OF TOM. THAT'S A BIG LINEMAN. HE JUST THROWS TO THE GROUND AND THEN MAKES THE PLAY. >> Al: COULDN'T MAKE THE CUT THERE. 2nd DOWN AND 9. NOT A LOT OF ROOM, THOUGH. DONTAYVION RICKS IS TACKLED THERE BY KWON ALEXANDER, ANOTHER GUY WHO JUST GOT INTO CAMP. >> Kirk: MAN, DO THEY RUN THE FOOTBALL. IT'S A COACHING CLINIC ON GUYS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT JERSEY NUMBER THEY'RE WEARING BUT THEY KNOW THEY'VE BEEN TAUGHT BY DAN CAMPBELL. THEY'RE GOING TO LIVE UP TO THE STANDARD. THEY'RE GOING TO RUN TO THE FOOTBALL, PLAY THE WHISTLE AND GET SOME TURN OVERS. >> Al: HELLO, MY NAME IS JAMAL, MY NAME IS KWON, GOOD TO MEET YOU. LOVE OFF BALANCE. THROWING, AND INCOMPLETE AT THE 20 YARD LINE. INTENDED FOR WICKS. LOVE WAS UNDER PRESSURE, THROWING OFF HIS BACK FOOT. 4th DOWN. >> Kirk: FOR A TEAM THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE A GREAT PASS RUSH, THEY ARE GETTING HOME RIGHT NOW. EZEKIAL TURNER BROUGHT ON THE BLITZ. ALSO SEEING GOOD GET OFF THERE BY 95, PAT O'CONNOR, ENOUGH ON THE BACK FOOT SO HE LOSES ACCURACY ON THE FOOTBALL. >> Al: DANIEL WHELAN THE PUNTER. ALEXANDER SETS UP INSIDE HIS 10 YARD FAIR CATCH MADE AT T 76 YARDS, AND A BOY, LOOK AT THE BLOCKING. YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT SENDING A MESSAGE. ONCE THEY GOT 1st AND GOAL, LAPORTA IN MOTION, BLOWS IT UP NICE JOB, TRYING TO SEND A MESSAGE THERE TO THIS PACKERS >> Al: START THIS DRIVE FROM THE 8 YARD THREE TIGHT END. YOU'VE GOT GIBBS AS THE RUNNING BACK. HERE'S GIBBS. TACKLE THERE BY LUCAS VAN NESS. 2nd AND 9. >> Kirk: JEFF HAFLEY CAME OVER, LEFT COLLEGE AS A COLLEGE HEAD COACH AND DECIDED TO COME BACK TO THE NFL WHERE HE'D BEEN ASSISTANT FOR A LONG TIME AND BROUGHT A NEW SCHEME IN. IT JUST FEELS LIKE SECOND HALF OF THE SEASON AS YOU'D EXPECT HE GETS TO KNOW THE PLAYERS A BIT BETTER, THEY GET TO KNOW HIS SCHEME, PLAYING MUCH FASTER THAN IN RECENT WEEKS. THEY GUY KNEW THEY HAD THEIR HANDS FULL. >> Al: WALKER MAKES THE TACKLE THERE ON GIBBS, SETTING UP A THIRD DOWN. >> Kirk: WALKER'S REALLY BECOME THE GUY THAT THEY TURN TO. HE'S THE GREEN DOT. AND AGAIN WITH THE ROOKIE EDGERRIN COOPER DOWN, TAKES ON EVEN MORE RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT GOT TO GET THE CALLS. GOT TO HAVE DES PLNED EYES AGAINST A VERY BALANCED OFFENSE WITH GOFF AND THE WEAPONS HE HAS AROUND HIM. >> Al: LEADING THE TEAM IN TACKLES, HE DID IN HIS FIRST TWO SEASONS AS WELL. 3rd DOWN AND 5. GOFF UNDER PRESSURE, GOING TO GET HIM. AT THE 10 YARD LINE. THAT TIME RASHAN GARY COMES IN. MORE RUSHING THI YEAR. >> Kirk: AND ALSO BRINGING UP THE BLITZ UP THE MIDDLE. BY BRINGING THAT BLITZ IT CREATES A LITTLE ONE-ON-ONE. COMES OFF OF SULE. THERE'S THE BLITZ FROM 7, AND THEN THERE'S NO ONE ABLE TO ADJUST GAUZE OF THAT BLITZ TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP GARY ONCE HE MOVES OFF OF SULE. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO STOP GOFF. YOU'VE GOT TO GET HIM OFF THE SPOT AND GOT TO PRESSURE HIM. >> Al: JACK FOX HAVING A GREAT YEAR, LEADING THE LEAGUE IN NET PUNTING AVERAGE. AND A FAIR CATCH MADE AT THE 48 YARD LINE HERE BY JAYDEN REED. SO TALKING ABOUT THE LIONS AND THE INJURIES. AND THERE'S AARON -- YOU CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS GUY. I MEAN BEN JOHNSON GETS A LOT OF THE TALK IN REGARD TO THE NEXT HEAD COACH. WHAT ABOUT THIS GUY? LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THE GUYS ON INJURED RESERVE RIGHT NOW INCLUDING HUTCHPSON, DAVENPORT, ANZALONE. THESE ARE BIG GUYS, IMPORTANT GUYS. THEY BRING IN GUYS OFF THE STREET AND THEY'RE DOING A GREAT JOB. >> Kirk: I'M WITH YOU. NOT ONLY DO YOU LOSE YOUR ALPHA IN HUTCHSON, BUT FOUR OF YOUR TOP FIVE LINE BACKERS. YOU'RE BRINGING GUYS OFF THE STREET AND YOU'RE TEACHING THEM YOUR SCHEME. I'LL TELL YOU FIRST DRIVE THEY DIDN'T LOOK CONFUSED. THEY WERE PLAYING FAST. >> Al: FROM THE 48, OUT OF THE PISTOL. WOULD HAVE BEEN ROOM HERE FOR JOSH JACOBS. NOW WE GO TO KAYLEE. >> GUYS, TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, THE LIONS DEFENSIVE LINEMAN ALIM MIC INTERNATIONAL HAS BEEN TAKEN TO GET EVALUATED FOR CONCUSSION. >> Al: YOU SAW HIM BEING TAKEN OFF THE FIELD. >> Kirk: AS GOOD AS THEY ARE WITH THAT RUNNING BACK AND THAT TANDEM I'D ARGUE D.J. READER AND McNEILL AS GOOD IN THE RUN IN THE NFL AND BOTH OF THEM NOW OUT OF THIS GAME. >> Al: 2nd AND 5. LOVE THROWS, GOING TO THE GROUND TO MAKE THE GRAB, AND HE DOES. FIRST DOWN IS REED. >> Kirk: A GOOD CATCH FROM A GUY WHO'S HAD ISSUES. THIS WHOLE RECEIVING HAS HAD ISSUES WITH DROPS. ACTUALLY THEY'RE GOING TO WAVE THAT ONE OFF WITH REPLAY ASSISTANCE. >> Al: RIGHT. REPLAY ASSIST SAYS NO. WELL, I'LL INTERPRET IT'S 3rd AND 5. >> Kirk: YEAH, HERE'S A GREAT LOOK AT. GREAT CALL. INCOMPLETION. I WAS GOING TO SAY THEY'VE HAD DROPS ESPECIALLY REED AND WICKS. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT CATCH. BUT NONETHELESS IT IS TAKEN AWAY, SO THIRD >> Al: THAT IS AN EXPEDITED REVIEW, THE WAY IT SHOULD BE. >> Kirk: THE BEST. >> Al: 3rd DOWN AND 5. >> Kirk: YEAH, LOOK AT EVERYBODY UP AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. >> Al: LOOK OUT. DOES ANYTHING JUST TO GET IT AWAY, WHICH HE DOES. EZEKIEL TURNER THAT TIME COMING IN, PUTTING THE HEAT ON 4th AND 5. BRINGING PRESSURE, BUT I'LL TELL YOU HAVING A GAME IS THE GUY IN THE MIDDLE. LOOK AT THAT GET OFF WITH O'CONNOR, PAT O'CONNOR, OUT OF EASTERN MICHIGAN. WITH THESE GUYS THAT ARE DOWN, HE HAS STEPPED UP WITH HIS OPPORTUNITY, SECOND TIME WE'VE SEEN HIM GET OFF THE BALL IN PLUS TERRITORY. THEY'RE GOING FOR IT. >> Al: YEP, 4th AND 5. AT LEAST LINING UP TO GO FOR IT. SCOREBOARD HAS THE DECIBEL LEVEL AT 115. THAT'S WHAT IT IS IN AN AIRPORT. CLAP, CLAP, CLAP, AND SNOW NO SNATCH. JUST TRYING TO LOOK TO DRAW THEM OFF SIDE AND THEY CAN'T. NOW COMES THE PUNT GROUP. >> Kirk: YOU GO BACK AND TAKE A PEEK WITH THE HIT ON JORDAN LOVE, I'D RUFB TO ASK TERRY HIS OPINION WHAT DO YOU SEE AFTER HE RELEASES THE FOOTBALL? >> IT SURE LOOKS THIS IS FORCED CONTACT. ROUGHING THE PASSER SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED ON THIS ONE. >> Kirk: Za'DARIUS SMITH WITH THE RIGHT HAND CAME THROUGH, CLUBBED HIM WITH THE FACE MASK. >> Al: MISSED THAT ONE. LOVE TO THE BENCH. IN COMES THE PUNT DAN WHELAN, HIS FIRST PUNT WAS 43 YARDS. MORICE ALEXANDER TO RECEIVE IT. ALEXANDER CALLS FOR A FAIR CATCH. MAKES IT AT THE 11 THE HIT TO THE HEAD WAS MISSED. 3:50 TO GO IN THE OPENING QUARTER.RANKS AND BATMAN. DOWNTOWN DETROIT. BACK WE COME WILLIAMS, HE GETS BUMPED OUT OF BOUNDS FOR A GAIN OF ABOUT 6 BY CARRINGTON VALENTINE. 2nd DOWN. >> Kirk: WE SAW A CONVERS WHEN THEY MOVED ST. BROWN ON A SIMILAR PLAY. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SOFT CUSHION AND CREATING SPACE AND MATCHUPS. THAT TIME FOR JAMESON WILLIAMS. >> Al: GREEN BAY MINUS JAIRE ALEXANDER, ONE OF THE TOP CORNERS IN THE LEAGUE. 2nd AND 4. FROM THE 17. OFF PLAY ACTION, GOFF ROLLING AND THROWING, AND JUST THROWS IT AWAY. TO THE DOWN MARKER, ERIC WILLIAMS CHASED HIM. 3rd AND 4. DIALING UP PRESSURE. THE LAST TIME WE SAW A LITTLE BIT MORE BLITZING, THIS TIME ACTUALLY HE BRINGS 45 ERIC WILSON FROM THE FIELD, DOES A GOOD JOB FLUSHING HIM OUT OF THE POCKET, AND THAT'S THEIR WHOLE FOCUS ANY DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR KNOWS IF GOFF IS BACK THERE CLEAN, IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG NIGHT. >> Al: 3rd AND 4, KEEP IT ON THE GROUND, TRY TO GET THAT FIRST VERY CLOSE TO IT IS GIBBS. LET'S SEE WHERE THEY SPOT IT, AND COMING IN AS IF TO GIVE HIM THE 1st DOWN AND HE DOES. HE'S GOT ONE AT THE 21 >> Kirk: THAT'S AN EXAMPLE THERE. 3rd AND 4, YOU WOULD THINK THE HAMMER DAVID MONTGOMERY WOULD COME IN THERE, RIGHT? YOU NEED SOME YARDS BETWEEN THE TACKLE. BUT, NO, GIBBS SHOWS HIS VERSATILITY, RUNS THROUGH A FEW ARM TACKLES. BOY, THAT WAS CLOSE. LOOKS THAT SECOND EFFORT GOT HIM ACROSS THE LINE THERE. >> Al: JUST OUTSIDE THE 20. AND NOW WE WERE THINKING, YEAH, SO LaFLEUR IS GOING TO CHALLENGE. THAT WAS A 3rd AND 4. SO IF HE WINS THE CHALLENGE, IT'LL BE 4th AND INCHES. >> Kirk: WELL, THE THING I THINK YOU'LL SEE IN MY OPINION EVAN WILLIAMS WHEN HE FIRST HIT HIM, 33, I THINK HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS SHORT. BUT WHEN HE TWISTED AND THEN KEPT MOVING, I THINK HE ENDED UP GETTING PASSED FOR THE >> Al: A CHALLENGE. TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT 2:30 TO GO IN THE QUARTER. THE VERDICT WHEN WE COME BACK. >> Referee: AFTER REVIEW, THE RUNNER DID MAKE THE LINE TO GAIN FOR A FIRST DOWN. GREEN BAY IS CHARGED WITH A FIRST TIMEOUT FOR AN UNSUCCESSFUL THIS IS CONSIDERED THEIR FIRST CHALLENGE. >> Al: YEAH THAT'S A -- IT'S ALWAYS A TOUGH CHALLENGE TO WIN ON THE SPOT LIKE THAT. THAT EFFORT SPINNING AROUND THAT WAS A >> Kirk: THE OPPOSITE ANGLE. LIKE I SAID, WITHOUT THAT SECOND EFFORT I DON'T THINK HE GETS >> Al: GIBBS, NOTHING. TACKLE UP TO THE LINE OF SCRIM MG. CLARK NUMBER ONE PICK IN 2016 OUT OF UCLA. 2nd DOWN AND 10. >> Kirk: MOST OF HIS CAREER HE WAS KNOWN AS A GREAT PASS RUSHER AND GOOD AGAINST THE RUN THERE. HE GETS PENETRATION. TOUGH TO DO AGAINST THE CENTER, BUT HE DOES IT. WHAT IT DOES IS FREE THE LINE BACKERS TO GET DOWNHILL IN A HURRY WITH WALKER AND 10. TO THE OUTSIDE. GIBBS, STAYS ON HIS FEET. TURNS NOTHING INTO A LITTLE SOMETHING. BUT IT'LL BE 3rd DOWN AND 5. >> Kirk: I'LL TELL YOU GREEN BAY HOLDING THEIR OWN AT THE LINE AGAIN, THIS IS MAYBE THE BEST OFFENSIVE LINE IN THE GAME. HE HAD TO POUNCE THIS OUTSIDE. HOW ABOUT THE ROOKIE EVAN WILLIAMS, BUT THERE ONCE AGAIN IS GIBBS SHOWING YOU HE'S NOT JUST A GUY OUT IN SPACE. PHYSICAL RUNNER BOUNCING OFF OF THAT HIT BY EVAN WILLIAMS. DIDN'T WRAP UP, SO ABLE TO GET AROUND HIM FOR A FEW MORE YARDS. >> Al: 1:20 THE QUARTER. GOING NOWHERE. COLBY WOODEN STOPS HIM IN HIS TRACKS. SECOND YEAR GUY OUT OF AUBURN. FOURTH DOWN. >> Kirk: AND AGAIN, LOOK, 77 IS ONE OF THE BEST CENTERS IN THE GAME. HE JUST OLAYS HIM WITH QUICKNESS. THEY ARE GETTING OFF THE BALL AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE IN THE LAST TWO SERIES. THEY'RE WINNING A POINT UP FRONT. AND VERY HARD TO DO WITH THIS LINE. >> Al: FOX IS PUNT, FLAG IS THROWN, FAIR CATCH IS CALLED FOR, AND MADE AT THE 26 SO JOHN HUSSEY HUSTLES AS I SAY, HE'S WORKING ON TWO DAYS REST. >> Kirk: YEAH, NOT EASY. >> Al: NO. >> Referee: DURING THE KICK, HOLDING, 10-YARD PENALTY, FIRST >> Al: 35 SECONDS LEFT IN THE FIRST QUARTER. LIONS ON TOP 7-0. THEIR 11th GAME IN A ROW. JACOBS AND BROOKS ARE BOTH IN THE BACKFIELD. JACOBS. HE'S HAVING A GREAT CHRIS BROOKS LEADING THE WAY. >> Kirk: HE SURE HAS. WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE MUCH TO TALK ABOUT HIM. AARON JONES GOES TO MINNESOTA, AND JOSH JACOBS LAS VEGAS RAIDERS, WE HAD THEM LAST WEEK. I KNOW THEY WANTED TO HOLD ONTO HIM, BUT HE LEAVES, COMES TO GREEN BAY AND BRINGS A DIFFERENT KIND OF MORE DOWNHILL, MORE BEHIND THE TACKLES THAN WHO THEY WERE THE LAST FEW YEARS WITH AARON JONES, MORE ON THE EDGE OUTSIDE ZONE. >> Al: THAT LAST RUN TOOK HIM TO 1,000 YARDS FOR THE SEASON. THAT'LL BE THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER. WEEK FROM TONIGHT. MEANWHILE, McNEILL IS BACK IN THE GAME. >> Kirk: GREAT NEWS. >> Al: YEAH. MATT LaFLEUR TOLD US THIS WEEK HE'S A SEVERELY UNDERRATED PLAYER. PRESSURE IS PUT ON. PASS IS GOTTEN AWAY. CHRISTIAN WATSON WITH A NINTH MOVE AND LOSES THE BALL. AND FOR THE MOMENT THE LIONS HAVE IT. HE GOT CAUGHT BY CARLTON DAVIS, LOST IT ALONG THE SIDELINE AND STAYS INBOUNDS AND DETROIT WITH THE TAKE >> Kirk: DETROIT BRINGING A LOT OF THEY PLAY A LOT OF MAN-TO-MAN COVERAGE. NOBODY PICKS UP CHRISTIAN WATSON, AND THIS IS WHY YOU NEVER GIVE UP ON A PLAY. CUTS BACK AWAY FROM JOSEPH. WATCH FROM BEHIND, THE CRAFTY VETERAN. CARLTON DAVIS KNOCKS THAT BALL LOOSE, AND THE LIONS ARE ABLE TO POUNCE ON IT. NOT SURE KNEE IS OFF THE GROUND. AND IT IS. BALL IS IN THE AIR, DETROIT FOOTBALL. BUT THEY NOW HAVE BLITZED ON FIVE OF THE SEVEN DROP BACKS WITH ALL THESE NEW FACES. THAT TIME ONE OF THE NEW FACES, JONAH WILLIAMS, WHO APPLIED THE MOST PRESSURE. AND THE LIPS TALKED ABOUT TURN OVERS WITH US ALL WEEK AND THEY GOT ONE THERE. >> Al: AND DAVID LONG RECOVERED IT. NOW GOFF OFF THE PLAY FAKE, FIRES INTO TRAFFIC. AND THAT IS TAKEN IN THERE BY THE TIGHT END, SAM LaPORTA. >> Kirk: AND THEY LOVE THESE ROUTES OVER THE MIDDLE OF THE DEFENSE. TRY TO PICK ON THOSE LINE BACKERS, PUT THEM IN CONFLICT. THAT TIME IT WAS QUAY WALKER. HE CAME OFF A BIT LATE, AND GOFF WAS ABLE TO SQUEEZE IT IN THERE FOR A NICE GAIN. >> Al: SEVEN FIRST DOWNS FOR THE LIONS. ONLY ONE FOR GREEN BAY. MONTGOMERY SCORED THE TO THE 39 YARD LINE. A LITTLE EXTRA ACTION AFTER THE PLAY. YOU SEE THE FLAG COMING IN. YOU GOT QUAY WALKER INVOLVED AND DAN >> Kirk: YEAH, THAT'S AN EASY CALL, RIVALRY. IT'S GOING TO GET A LITTLE HEATED. AND THAT TIME QUAY WALKER LOST HIS COOL. AFTER HE GOT PUSHED NEAR THE END NEAR THE END OF THE WHISTLE. >> Al: AFTER THE PLAY WAS OVER, PERSONAL FOUL. UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS DEFENSE NUMBER 7. 15 YARD PENALTY WILL BE ENFORCED. >> Kirk: AL, HERE'S 70 SKIPPER FINISHING THE PLAY RIGHT HERE. WALKER DOESN'T LIKE IT, AND THEN HE HITS HIM, AND THE BIG FELLA GOES DOWN. THAT'S A BIG MAN GOING AT 6'9", 330, LOOKS LIKE A BIG TIME WRESTLER OUT THERE. >> Al: HE DOES. I THINK IT'S THE FOURTH STINT HE'S HAD WITH THE LIONS. HE'S BEEN ALL OVER THE LEAGUE. >> Kirk: BOUNCES NOT ONLY ALL OVER THE LEAGUE AND LIONS BUT OFFENSIVE LINE. >> Al: FILLING IN TONIGHT FOR TAYLOR DECKER. GOOD ON THE COVERAGE THAT TIME AS McDUFFIE PUT THE PRESSURE ON. >> Kirk: HOW ABOUT DAVID MONTGOMERY JUST IN TIME. WHEN McDUFFIE COMES IN THE BLITZES, HE'S COMING IN FAST. THIS TIME MONTGOMERY LEARNED BECAUSE HE WAS IN BEFORE, HE SOLD OUT. GIVE McDUFFIE CREDIT BECAUSE HE KEPT FIGHTING THROUGH IT. BOY, MONTGOMERY STEPPED RIGHT INTO THAT BLITZ FROM 58. >> Al: GIBBS IS THE GIVE IT TO HIM. NOTHING DOING. SMOTHERED AT THE LINE DEVONTE WYATT IS >> Kirk: WYATT IS AN UNAPPRECIATED PLAYER. KIND OF A FORGOTTEN GUY. HAD A KNEE IN '23, HAD AN ANKLE THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER. THERE'S VAN NESS RUNNING OFF INTO THE LOCKER ROOM. I'LL TELL YOU NOW THAT HE'S HEALTHY DON'T BE SURPRISED TO SEE 95 AND WYATT MAKE MORE PLAYS. >> Al: 3rd AND 10. THROWING. CROWD WANTS A FLAG. WILL NOT GET ONE. IT'LL BE 4th DOWN AND AND IN COMES THE FIELD GOAL GROUP TO MAKE IT 10-0. >> Kirk: THAT TIME GOFF AS EXPERIENCED AS HE IS, BLITS, DROPPED AT THE LAST SECOND, DEFENSIVE END. MOSBY EFFECTS THAT, AND JAMESON WILLIAMS, HE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS MANNED OR ZONED, AND HE STOPPED AND DIDN'T KNOW IF THEY WOULD KEEP GOING AND MISSED. ONLY MISSED LAST WEEK FROM 45. THIS IS FROM 43. JACK FOX TO PUT IT AND THE KICK IS GOOD. 2 MINUTES INTO THE SECOND QUARTER, AND THE GAME OF THE WEEK >> Kirk: YE YOUNG QUARTERBACK YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW MUCH HE HAD A CHANCE TO LEARN FROM WHIT AT THAT STAGE OF HIS >> Al: ABSOLUTELY. >> Kirk: LEARNED FROM THE BEST. >> Al: YEP. TO KICK OFF.0 THE PACKERS HAVE ONLY 37 YARDS ON TEN PLAYS. THEY'RE ONLY FIRST DOWN BY WAY OF PENALTY. CAN THEY GET SOMETHING GOING? THEY START HERE ON THE GROUND. 4-YARD GAIN HERE FOR JACOBS, TACKLED BY >> Kirk: YEAH, I THINK YOU'LL SEE THEM GOING AND MORE BACK TO THE RUNNING GAME FOR JOSH THE REASON IS HE'S DONE A GOOD JOB CREATING PRESSURE. HAS 13 PLAYERS ON THE DEFENSE ALONE ON IR, THREE MORE DOWN A LOT OF NEW FACES. THERE'S MUHAMMAD GETTING THE INVOLVE, PAT O'CONNOR, A LOT OF DEFENSE FACES. THERE'S MAYBE THE DEFENSIVE ASSISTANT COACH, COORDINATOR MAYBE, AND THE ENTIRE NFL WITH WHAT HE HAS FACED, AARON GLENN, DOING A GREAT JOB SO FAR TONIGHT. >> Al: WORKING WITH PACE. NICE HOLE OVER THE RIGHT SLIDE, AND THERE HE GOES FOR A FIRST DOWN AND MORE IS JOSH YOU KNOW, THE ONE THING ABOUT JACOBS AND BARKLEY AND HENRY AND MIXEN, THIR OGOING TO START MAKING THE RUNNING BACKS NOT UNDERVALUED ANYMORE. >> Kirk: I AGREE WITH THAT'S BECOME A BIG STORY THIS YEAR, AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE. IT'S BEEN FANTASTIC, AND THIS IS WHAT HE BRINGS TO THE OFFENSE. THIS IS AN OFFENSE BUILT ON THE RUN GAME FIRST. THEY'VE GOT TO GET HIM GOING. THAT'S WHAT HE CAN DO RUNNING THROUGH THE ARM TACKLES, HE GETS GOING AND THEN YOU'LL SEE MATT LaFLEUR DIAL-UP THE PLAY-ACTION PASS OPPORTUNITY LATER. >> Al: TAKING THAT ONE TO THE 40 YARD LINE. GAIN OF 7, MUHAMMAD MAKING THE STOP THERE. IT'LL BE 2nd AND 3. >> Kirk: WITHOUT HAVING AN A.J. DYLAN TYPE OF HAMMER BACK THERE, IT'S NICE TO SEE BROOKS AND WILSON PROVIDING A LITTLE DEPTH IN THAT BACKFIELD SPOT. JOSH JACOBS, GIVE HIM CREDIT, HE HAS BEEN A WORKHORSE. SEVEN GAMES HE'S GONE OVER 18 CARRIES, LET ALONE GETS INVOLVED IN CATCHING THE BALL IN THE BACKFIELD, TOO. WILSON AND BROOKS THE LONGER YOU GET INTO DECEMBER AND JANUARY, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED JOSH JACOBS HEALTHY, SO IT'S GOOD THEY'RE GOING TO STEP IN >> Al: WILSON AND BROOKS ARE BOTH IN THE BACKFIELD. NOW WILSON IN MOTION, GIVE IT TO BROOKS, AND HE'S FIGHTING FOR A MAY HAVE PICKED IT UP. THEY'RE GOING TO MARK IT AT ABOUT THE 37 RIPPING AT THAT BALL TRYING TO GET IT OUT OF THERE. >> Al: FIRST DOWN. HEATING UP JACOBS THROUGH WEEK 13. 987, HE'S OVER 1,000 YARDS WITH HIS EFFORT HERE TONIGHT. HE'S ALREADY GAINED 36 YOU GO BACK TO BROCKINGTON AND AMAN GREEN WHO FINISHED IN PASS RUSH. PRETTY GOOD COMPANY JACOBS IS BACK IN THE BALL AT THE 37 YARD AND LOOK OUT. AND WHO MOVED FIRST? JOSH MYERS SNAPPING >> Kirk: I DIDN'T SEE A FLINCH. IT'S GOOD THEY MIXED IN A HARD COUNT ON O'CONNOR BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN GETTING OFF THE BALL SO QUICKLY, HE'S MAKING IT TOUGH ON MYERS AND JENKINS TO GUARD. AND I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S UP THERE, HAS SOME KIND OF TAIL OR SOME KIND OF CUE THAT'S GETTING HIM OFF THE BALL, BUT GOOD JOB BY GREEN BAY. MAYBE THAT'LL SLOW HIM DOWN A LITTLE BIT. >> Al: 5-YARD PENALTY. 1st AND 5 AT THE 32. STOPPED AT THE LINE OF JACOBS GOING NOWHERE. JACK CAMPBELL'S SECOND YEAR OUT OF IOWA MAKING THE TACKLE. >> Kirk: AGAIN, THE PERSONALITY, THE CULTURE OF DAN CONNER TEAMS, WATCH YOU'LL SEE MAN GO IN MOTION WHO'S A BIG MAN IN TUCKER KRAFT. WATCH 85, WATCH THIS. BANG, LOOK AT THAT MESSAGE BEING SENT. THAT'S TREVOR WHO HITS HIM THERE, AND KRAFT'S GOING TO THINK TWICE BEFORE HE COMES IN MOTION TO BLOCK 53. WHAT A PLAY. >> Al: 2nd AND 3. TO THE 24 YARD LINE, SO GREEN BAY ON THE MOVE, DRIVE STARTED BACK AT THEIR 30 YARD THEY RUN SIX PLAYS FOR 46 YARDS HERE. ALL RUNS, TOO. >> Kirk: YEAH, BEING VERY PATIENT HERE. LOOKS LIKE SEAN RHYAN NEEDS SOME HELP OFF. >> Al: RHYAN THE RIGHT GUARD. COMING UP FOR AT LEAST ONE PLAY. >> Kirk: HE WAS THE POLAR THERE. HE HITS KWON ALEXANDER NUMBER 10. FROM THE BOTTOM YOU'LL SEE HIM WORK UP AND KWON ALEXANDER HITS I THINK THAT COLLISION MAYBE STUNNED MIM. HE'S GOING TO GO TO THE SIDELINE AND HOPEFULLY COME BACK. >> Al: YEAH, THAT'S KADEEM TELFORT COMES INTO HIS SPOT. FIRST DOWN AT THE 24 LEFT SIDE. HARD YARD FLAG THROWN, THAT'S JACOBS FOR ONE. >> Kirk: THIS IS WHY YOU SEE DEFENSES PLAY SOME COVERAGE. THEY WANT TEAMS TO HAVE TO DRIVE THE BALL WITHOUT MAKING MISTAKES, AND GREEN BAY HAD BEEN DOING IT UNTIL THIS HOLDING CALL. DON'T GIVE UP THE EXPLOSIVE. MAKE THEM HAVE TO DRIVE WITHOUT MAKING MISTAKES. OFFENSE NUMBER 74. >> Al: SO THAT'S THE LEFT YARD. THAT'S ELTON JENKINS. 1st AND 20 NOW. OVER HERE ON THE LEFT. CAN SEE THAT LEFT HAND GRABBING ONTO THE JERSEY. >> Al: SO BACK TO THE 35 YARD LINE AGAIN. LOVE IS 2 OUT OF 5 FOR 23 YARDS AND HAS NOT THROWN A PASS ON THIS DRIVE. >> Kirk: AND REMEMBER, AL, WHEN HE'S DROPPED BACK, THEY HAVE BROUGHT PRESSURE, AND IT'S EFFECTED HIM AND THE OFFENSIVE LINE. >> Al: MAJOR. BUT THIS TIME HE HAS TIME, AND HE'S ABLE TO COMPLETE THE PASS TO THE 28 YARD LINE. THAT'S TUCKER KRAFT, TACKLED BY BRANCH. LUKE MUSGRAVE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER ONE TIGHT END, BUT HE'S GIVEN KRAFT THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHINE THIS YEAR, AND HE HAS GIVEN SIX TOUCHDOWNS. >> Kirk: THERE'S THE ROOKIE SAFETY OUT OF OREGON WHO'S HAD A BIG IMPACT ON HIS TEAM. JEFF HAFLEY TELLING US THIS WEEK HOW IMPRESSED HE'S BEEN WITH THE WAY HE'S BEEN ABLE TO ICPICK THINGS UP. MATT LaFLEUR AND THE PACKERS POTENTIALLY LOSE THEIR SAFETY. >> Al: 2nd AND 12. LOVE, STEPPING UP. STEPPING OUT. LOOKS TO THE FIRST DOWN AND GETS IT. SO FROM THE 1st AND 20 TO ANOTHER FIRST DOWN AS THEY TAKE IT TO THE >> Kirk: MUHAMMAD GIBSON SOME PRESSURE OVER FOR HIS RIGHT, BUT THIS OPENS UP NICELY. REMEMBER YOU TOUCHED ON SOME OF THE INJURIES HE DEALT WITH EARLY DOWN IN BRAZIL IN THE GROIN THAT SLOWED HIM DOWN. THIS IS WHAT HE CAN BRING TO THE TABLE WHEN HE'S HEALTHY. WAVE SEEN HIM BECOME THIS KIND OF GUY THE LAST THREE WEEKS, AND THIS HAS BEEN MISSING THIS GREEN BAY OFFENSE. WHEN EVERYTHING'S COVERED AND YOU PLAY MANNED COVERAGE, YOU BETTER ACCOUNT FOR NUMBER 10 OR HE'S GOING TO TAKE OFF. >> Al: HIS LONGEST RUN OF THE YEAR, 14 YARDS. BACK TO THE GROUND. TURNER. AND A PENALTY. >> Kirk: THESE LINE BACKERS ARE PLAYING. THEY'RE ADJUSTING TO THE MOTION, GETTING DOWNHILL. THIS PENALTY MAY BE ON >> Referee: ILLEGAL USE OF THE HANDS, HANDS TO THE FACE, DEFENSE NUMBER 99. 5-YARD PENALTY WILL BE ADDED INTO THE RUN. >> Al: SO Za'DARIUS SMITH. WHEN THEY LOST HUTCHINSON, THEY PICKED UP SMITH. HAS DONE A GREAT JOB THE FRONT OFFICE HAS BRINGING GUYS IN OFF THE STREET, TAKING TRADES FOR GUYS. >> Kirk: GETS HIS HAND UNDERNEATH, YOU CAN SEE ON THE NECK THERE. SO THEY GET 5 YARDS. STILL FIRST DOWN. >> Al: EIGHT RUNS, ONE PASS. LOOKING FOR ROOM. THREADING HIS WAY. NICE MOVE. TO ABOUT THE 1 1/2 GOES JOSH JACOBS, 2nd DOWN AND GOAL. AL. THAT LITTLE HESITATION ALLOWED JOSH MYERS TO BE ABLE TO STAY ON HIS BLOCK AND GOT HIM TO BE ABLE TO WIGGLE THROUGH FOR MORE THIS PLAY POTENTIALLY BLOWN UP. WATCH THE CENTER, 71, A LITTLE HESITATION. GETS UNDERNEATH THAT, AND AGAIN, HE'S ABLE TO SHAKE THROUGH. HE'S ONE OF THE BEST BACKS IN THE NFL WITH YARDS AFTER CONTACT. IN FACT, HE'S THIRD IN THE LEAGUE, AND THAT TIME GOOD JOB OF SHOWING HIS VISION TO BE ABLE TO GET SOME POSITIVE YARDS. >> Al: 6 MINUTES TO HALF TIME. 2nd AND GOAL. JACOBS AGAIN. A FAKE TO HIM, AND THEN TUCKER KRAFT WAS THE INTENDED RECEIVER. IT'S INCOMPLETE. >> Kirk: WHAT A CALL. DEFENSE HAS THEIR EYES IN THE BACKFIELD. THEIR LOCKED IN ON JOSH JAKINGS. AND SEE THE EYES OF 32, BRANCH, HE JUST NEEDED TO PUT A LITTLE AIR UNDER THIS AND FLOAT IT OUT THERE AND AN EASY TOUCHDOWN. MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PACKERS ON THAT LOVE, UNDER PRESSURE. AND THAT'S A FLAG IN THE END ZONE. FOR THE MOMENT IT'S TAKEN BY DAVIS, BUT LET'S SEE ABOUT THE CALL IN THE END ZONE. SO FOR THE MOMENT THE LIONS THINK THEY HAVE IT, BUT YOU LOOK AT ARN LDS EXPRESSION, AND THAT MAY TELL YOU -- SPEAK VOLUMES ANYWAY. WE'LL SEE. CAMPBELL WANTS TO KNOW. SO DO WE. >> Kirk: YEAH, THEY GOT THE ROOKIE TERRION ARNOLD MAN-TO-MAN AGAINST WATSON ON THAT BACK LINE. IT LOOKED LIKE WATSON WAS TRYING TO WORK BACK TO HIS QUARTERBACK TO OUR LEFT. >> Al: YEAH, ARNOLD WAS ALREADY PLEADING HIS CASE BEFORE DAVIS PICKED UP THE BALL. SO WITH 5:30 TO GO, PENALIZED FOR PASS 17 TIMES. A COUPLE OF TIMES THAT'S THE MOST IN THE AND THAT'S THE THIRD FIRST DOWN FOR GREEN BAY TONIGHT BY TWO ON THIS DRIVE. CAN THEY GET IT INTO THE END ZONE? YES, HE CAN. JACOBS WITH A NOT THE PRETTIEST DRIVE WE'VE EVER SEEN. >> Kirk: NO. NO. >> Al: BUT VERY EFFECTIVE. 10 RUNS, 2 PASSES. YOU DON'T SEE THAT VERY OFTEN ON A TWO PLAY DRIVE. >> Kirk: THIS DRIVE AVERAGE 6 1/2 YARDS PER CARRY, THEY TURNED IT OVER AFTER GETTING DOWN 10. THEY DIDN'T PANIC, TURNED IT OVER ON THE OFFENSIVE LINE AND TURNED IT OFF OVER TO THE GUY THAT'S BEEN CARRYING THEM IN THAT BACKFIELD, SKBRAUGS AND PAID OFF WITH THAT >> Al: FOR THE MOMENT HAS SOLVED GREEN BAY'S KICKING PROBLEMS. LONG-TIME DENVER THAT ONE THROUGH. AND WITH 5:30 TO GO IN THE HALF, IT'S DETROIT 10, GREEN BAY 7. 31-8, 70 TOUCHDOWNS. THAT EQUALS KANSAS CITY FOR THE BEST MARK IN THE LEAGUE. IT ALL GOT TURNED AND FOR JARED GOFF, A GUY WHO, YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY HAD HIS CONFIDENCE SHOOK WHEN HE GOT TRADED FOR MATTHEW STAFFORD, OF COURSE THAT WORKED OUT VERY WELL FOR THE RAMS, BUT IS NOW WORKING OUT EXTREMELY WELL FOR THE LIONS. SO BOTH TEAMS ARE GOING TO WIND UP WITH WHAT THEY WANTED. HAPPENED WITH STAFFORD AND THE RAMS, INTENSIFIED THE TRADE AND ALMOST THE MOCKING SORT OF THE REACTION TO GOFF. I THINK THAT'S HOW HE TOOK IT. HE GETS HERE, GET OFF TO A SLOW START WITH HIM, THINGS AREN'T GOING WELL. MEANWHILE THE RAMS ARE THE BELL OF THE BALL. EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT SEAN McVEIGH AND MATTHEW STAFFORD. >> Al: THE RAMS WENT ALL IN '21. THEY PULLED IT OFF. A 9 YARD GAIN HERE FOR DERRICK. SEAN McVAY IS DOWN THERE IN CABO, MATTHEW STAFFORD IS THERE. THEY GET DEAL. >> Kirk: IT WORKED OUT FOR GOFF. THERE'S HIS FAMILY, HIS DAD. AND IT'S A TEAM I THINK FEELS THEY HAVE WHAT IT TAKES. THEY BUILT AROUND HIM BEAUTIFULLY. OFFENSIVE LINE, THE TWO BACKS, GREAT SKILL. IT'S ALL WORKING OUT FOR 16. >> Al: THAT PASS IS CAUGHT AT THE 45 YARD ON THE MOVE AGAIN IT'S MAKING THAT CATCH QUICKLY. THIS ONE? A SAFETY PLAYING CENTER FIELD IN XAVIER McKINNEY. YOU'VE GOT TO PUT THIS DOWN ON A LINE. >> Al: 20-YARD GAIN. SHOOTS IT OFF TO THE SIDE. MONTGOMERY PICKS UP ABOUT 6. WE GO TO KAYLEE. >> GUYS, PACKERS DEFENSE LINEMAN LUCAS VAN NESS LEFT THE FIELD EARLY AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY. TURNS OUT HE INJURED HIS RIGHT THUMB. HE'S COME BACK TO THE SIDELINES, TALKED WITH THE ATHLETIC TRAINER AND HAS A VERY STRONG TAPE JOB ON HIS LEFT. >> Al: 2nd DOWN AND 5 NOW FOR DETROIT. FROM THE 37. CHANGING THE PLAY AT THE LINE. AND THEN LOST ONE AND JAMESON WILLIAMS, AND VALENTINE COVERING ON MAYBE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE. 3rd AND 5. CONTINUES DIALING UP SOME PRESSURE. KAYLEE JUST MENTIONED THE ROOKIE IS OUT. AND ANDERSON THE SECOND YEAR OUT OF BYU IS IN. TURNED HIM LOOSE ON A BLITZ, AND ONCE AGAIN DAVID MONTGOMERY RIGHT WHERE HE NEEDS TO BE TO PICK THAT BLITZ UP TO GIVE GOFF THE TIME. JUST NOT ABLE TO MAKE THIS THROW. LET'S SEE WHO HE DIALS UP HERE ON THIS THIRD >> Al: THREE TIGHT ENDS IN THIS SET. GOFF STEPS AWAY FROM PRESSURE, THROWS, CAUGHT. MONTGOMERY GOT ALMOST SACKED, TOOK A STEP FORWARD. WILSON IS THERE. >> Kirk: KEEP AN EYE ON THIS GUY, HE'S THERE TO HELP OUT, JUST A CHECK HOW MANY TIMES IF YOU'RE A LIONS FAN HAVE WE SEEN THAT? YOU CLEAR IT OUT. THE RECEIVERS ARE SO TALENTED. THE SAFETIES, THE LINE BACKERS ARE GETTING DEEP TO TAKE AWAY THOSE MIDDLE FIELD DIG ROUTES THAT HE LOVES, AND HE'S SO AWARE THAT ONCE IT'S TAKEN AWAY ESPECIALLY ON THIRD DOWN, CHECK IT DOWN TO MONTGOMERY OR GIBBS AND LET THEM DO THE WORK AFTER THE CATCH. >> Al: FIRST DOWN BY THE 31. GOFF, BUYS TIME, OPEN, LAPORTA INSIDE THE 20. AND STOPPED THERE BY ABOUT SIX WHITE SHIRTS. >> Kirk: BOY, IS THAT GREAT. WHEN YOU RUN THE FOOTBALL AND EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT RUNNING IT GREAT TONIGHT, AGAIN SOME PUSHING AND SHOVING. SULES RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT, 95 WYATT RIGHT THERE WITH HIM, GOING YOU CAN RUN THE FOOTBALL LIKE THIS. THIS IS THE STORY OF REALLY BEN JOHNSON'S EARLY DOWN-PLAY ACTION. YOU GET THOSE LINE BACKERS RUNNING TOWARDS GIBBS TO STOP HIM FROM RUNNING, AND THEN YOU'RE ABLE TO MOVE THAT LAUNCHING POINT AND GET GOFF AWAY FROM THE PRESSURE, IS HE'S GOT A WIDE OPEN LAPORTA THERE ON THE BACKSIDE. >> Al: TICKING DOWN TO THE 2-MINUTE WARNING. AND THEY HAD TO GET A PLAY OFF OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DELAY OF GAME. AND IT'S A RUN FOR GIBBS. AND THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE 2-MINUTE WARNING OFFICIALLY WITH 1:53 LEFT LEAD IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME OUT IN SAN FRANCISCO, ENDED UP NOT ABLE TO FINISH THAT OFF. THE NINERS WAN THE SUPER BOWL, AND HE HAD ALL THOSE INTERVIEWS. HE SAID I'M NOT QUITE READY TO LEAVE THIS >> Al: YOU'VE GOT TO WIPED UP WITH THE RIGHT ORGANIZATION. >> Kirk: THAT'S TRUE. >> Al: 2nd SQUUN DO7. QUICK TRIP TO THE RIGHT SIDE. LAPORTA, LOOK AT HIM BLOW HIS WAY TO THE 4-YARD LIENE. 4th AND GOAL. >> Kirk: SULE GETS OUT THERE AND ZEITLER, THE RIGHT GUARD YOU'LL SEE 71 AND 58 DO GOOD, TOUGH RUNNING. LAPORTA YARDS AFTER THE CATCH, BUT IT SURE HELPS GETTING THOSE LINEMEN OUT IN FRONT PAVING >> Al: 1st AND GOAL. CLOCK RUNNING DOWN ON 1:15. FINDING HIS WAY, JUST A LITTLE SHORT TO THE ONE OR EVEN INSIDE 2nd TIMEOUT TAKEN BY GREEN BAY WITH 60 SECONDS >> Kirk: YEAH, GOOD NOT FITZ. SOMEBODY HAS DISAPPEARED. HALFTIME SHOW COMING BROUGHT TO YOU BY STATE FARM. 2nd AND GOAL FROM 2. GOFF GOING TO KEEP IT HIMSELF AND TAKE IT TO -- NO SIGNAL YET. NO SIGNAL. NOW THERE IS. HAD TO COME IN AND GET A CLOSER LOOK AT IT. >> Kirk: HE CALLED OFF OF THE PLAY THAT THEY HAD. HE SAW THAT GAP OVER THE LEFT SHOULDER OF THE CENTER, AND HE LET EVERYBODY KNOW HE WAS GOING TO KEEP IT. MADE A GOOD DECISION. >> Al: HOLD ON, HE IS SO ONE OFFICIAL COMES IN FROM THE SIDE. AFTER A LONG WAIT, THERE'S YOUR -- KNEE. IT'S DOWN. >> Al: BALL IS NOT ACROSS THE GOAL LINE. >> Kirk: GREAT LOOK BRINGS THE KNEE DOWN. HE'S SHORT. >> Referee: IN ASPECT OF THE PLAY WE MUST RUN 10 SECONDS. GREEN BAY HAS ELECTED TO USE THEIR LAST TIMEOUT IN LIEU OF THE 10-SECOND RUNOFF. THIRD AND FINAL TIMEOUT, GREEN BAY. >> Al: RIGHT, THEY TOOK TWO ON THIS DRIVE AND COST THEM ONE WHEN THEY MISSED THE IT WAS NOT OVERTURNED, SO IT'S 3rd DOWN AND GOAL NOW FROM INSIDE THE 1 YARD LINE. >> Kirk: MEANWHILE, DAN CAMPBELL ONE OF THE THINGS HE MENTIONED TO US IS THE ONUS IS ON OUR WITH THE NEW FACES WE HAVE THIS WEEK, NOT ONLY ARE WE TRYING TO SCORE POINTS, BUT CLOCK AND THEY HAVE A 5-MINUTE THIRD POSSESSION ADVANTAGE, SO THEY'RE KEEPING JORDAN LOVE ON THE SIDELINE. THIS FIRST HALF, KEEPING HIM OUT OF RHYTHM. >> Al: 3rd AND THAT MONTGOMERY IS IN RESETTING THE GAME CLOCK IS WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT HERE. GOING TO RESET IT TO 1 MINUTE. THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE DELAY HERE. THERE YOU GO. JUST FOR THE MOMENT, TIME IS STANDING STILL. OKAY, WE'RE GOOD. 60 SECONDS. THEIR RUNNING BACK, HE'S ALREADY BEEN INTO THE END ZONE TONIGHT. AND HE'LL GET STUFFED AT THE 1. KENNY CLARK IS THERE. SO IT'S GOING TO BE 4th DOWN AND GOAL. DANGER AGAINST HAVING A GUY LIKE KENNY CLARK GOING UP AGAINST THIS CENTER NOW. YOU'LL SEE HIM GET OFF THE BALL AND WORK INTO THAT POWER BACKFIELD AND FREES UP THOSE BACKERS AS WELL. RASHAN GARY ABLE TO COME OFF THE EDGE AND HELP CLEAN THAT UP. SO THEY USE ABOUT A YARD AND A HALF. >> Al: SO IT'S 4th AND GREEN BAY DOES GET THE BALL BACK. READY TO TAKE A TIMEOUT HERE. THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THE CLOCK TO RUN-DOWN. AND THEY'LL TAKE THE TIMEOUT. IT'LL STOP AT 14 SECONDS AND 4th HUGE PLAY IN THIS ONE. GREEN BAY'S GOING TO GET THE BALL TO START THE SECOND HALF. >> Kirk: OH, THIS IS WHERE YOU WOULD ASSUME THEY'RE KEEPING THEIR OFFENSE OUT IN THE YOU WOULD ASSUME WITH A VETERAN QUARTERBACK WHO SEES THE FIELD SO WELL, PROCESSES QUICKLY, YOU KNOW, YOU WOULD THINK GREEN BAY WOULD BRING SOME YOU'VE GOT TO RELY ON YOUR OFFENSIVE LINE, AND YOU'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY TO CREATE A MATCHUP FOR ST. BROWN, 18, OR 87 LAPORTA. DOWN HERE THAT'S WHERE THEY CAN WIN IF THEY CAN FIND A MATCHUP THAT'S FAVORABLE. >> Al: NOW THEY'VE GOT GIBBS IN THE IS GOFF TRYING TO SNEAK IT IN AGAIN? HASN'T SCORED A TOUCHDOWN THIS SEASON. HAD A TEMPORARY ONE. 12th PLAY OF THIS BACKS UP, THROWS. TOUCHDOWN TO GIBBS. DIALLED UP THE THEY BROUGHT QUAY WALKER, BUT WHAT A CALL TALKING ABOUT LAPORTA AND ST. BROWN. HOW CAN YOU FORGET ABOUT GIBBS OUT OF THE BACKFIELD? YOU GET HIM ONE-ON-ONE AGAINST A LINEBACKER. ISAIAH McDUFFIE DREW THE SHORT STRAW. NO CHANCE ON THIS ANGLE ROUTE TO STAND WITH HIM. AND I'LL TELL YOU, GIBBS SOLD IT WELL TO THE OUTSIDE. >> Al: BATES FOR THE EXTRA POINT. AND THAT ONE IS JUST GOOD. BUT GOOD NONETHELESS, SO IT'S 17-7. >> Kirk: YOU WANT TO SEE HOW TO RUN THIS AGAINST MANNED COVERAGE, GIBBS IN COLLEGE WITH ALABAMA RUNS ROUTES WITH RECEIVERS. HE SELLS IT OUT THERE BUT THEN WORKS BACK UNDERNEATH. McDUFFIE AGAIN TRIES TO STAY WITH HIM. YOU SEE HIM TURN HIS SHOULDERS TO START STOOSPRINT TO GET OUT TO THE OUTSIDE IN A FLAT. HE HAD NO CHANCE OF TURNING AROUND. THAT IS A GREAT ROUTE AND WENT IN ONE-ON-ONE BY JAHMYR GIBBS AND HECK OF A CALL BY BEN JOHNSON, THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, TO GET HIM ISOLATED AND GET THAT MATCHUP TO >> Al: AND LaFLEUR'S EXPRESSION SAYS IT ALL. TURNING A 3-POINT DEFICIT INTO A 10-POINT DEFICIT. >> Kirk: GREEN BAY, YOU MENTION GETTING THE BALL TO START THE SECOND HALF. THEY'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO PROTECT THEIR QUARTERBACK, JORDAN LOVE. HE'S BEEN PRESSURED. THEY HAVE BLITZED HIM. HIS ONE DECENT COMPLETION TO WATSON ENDED UP A FUMBLE. A 20-YARD RECEPTION. IT WAS A FUMBLE. >> Al: GREEN BAY HELD ONLY 105 YARDS IN THE HALF. BALL WILL COME OUT TO THE 30 WITH THE TIME FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYS UNLESS THEY JUST WANT TO KNEEL IT DOWN, GO TO THE LOCKER ROOM, TAKE THE BALL, AND WE START THE SECOND HALF. LAST TIME THEY HAD THE BALL, IT WAS -- THEY RAN THE FOOTBALL, YOU KNOW, AND -- >> Al: HAD 12-PLAY DRIVE, 10 RUNS. >> Kirk: YEAH. SO YOU'RE DOWN 10, DOWN IN THE SECOND HALF, IT'S NOT TIME OBVIOUSLY TO PANIC. YOU GET THE BALL TO START IT. BUT COMBINATION OF RELYING ON THAT LINE IN JACOBS AND TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO HELP THIS QUARTERBACK HAVE TIME TO THROW. >> Al: KNEEL DOWN. TAKES US TO HALF TIME. GO TO KAYLEE. >> WELL, THREE COMPLETIONS, HE'S VERY CAPABLE, BUT THE DETROITER ANSWER TO HAVING ALL THIS INEXPERIENCE ON DEFENSE IS NOT SIT BACK AND MAKE THESE GUYS HAVE TO THINK. TURN THEM LOOSE, JUST GO AFTER THE QUARTERBACK WHEN HE DROPS BACK TO THROW. AND IT WORKED FOR A I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE WHAT MATT LaFLEUR'S ANSWER TO THAT IS IN DETROIT DEFENSE IS THE ANSWER IN THE SECOND WHAT A JOB THEY HAVE DONE. AND KAYLEE. >> THEY'VE HELD GREEN BAY TO 7 POINTS AND FORCED A TURNOVER. HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THEIR SUCCESS? >> LOOK, A.G.'S GOT A HELL A PLAN. MAKE THEM EARN ANYTHING THEY GET AND GET A TAKE AWAY. WE GOT ONE. WE'VE GOT TO GET ANOTHER ONE SECOND >> OFFENSIVELY YOU'VE CONTROLLED THE BALL AND PUT UP 17. HOW DO YOU REPLICATE THAT IN A SECOND? >> SAME THING, WE'RE DOING EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO AND WHAT WE SAID WE NEEDED TO DO. WE'VE GOT TO BE MORE EFFICIENT RUNNING THE FOOTBALL AND THAT WILL OPEN EVERYTHING UP FOR US. >> HERE WE GO, THIRD QUARTER BEGINS OUT OF THE PISTOL WITH LOVE. HANDING THE BALL, JACOBS TO THE OUTSIDE, AND THAT'S THE WAY THE FIRST HALF LOOKED MOST OF THE TIME. BRYAN BRANCH COMES UP TO KNOCK HIM DOWN THE BACKFIELD, 2nd AND 11. >> MAN IS HE FUN TO WATCH PLAY AGAINST THE RUN. HE MOVED FROM THAT NICKEL SPOT WHERE THEY PLAYED HIM BACK AT SAFETY, BUT WHEN HE READS RUN, HE KNOWS HOW TO GET UP, HOLD THAT EDGE AND LOWER THE BOOM. THOSE ARE TWO COLLEGE PLAYERS FROM THE SAME SCHOOL IN ALABAMA. AND JACOBS I THINK SURPRISED BY THE FORCE THERE OF BRYAN BRANCH. >> Al: WE DO ALL THESE GAMES I THINK HALF THE PLAYERS IN THE LEAGUE OR EITHER ALABAMA OR GEORGIA. YOU WOULD KNOW. 2nd AND 11. DEEP DROP. HAS TIME. GOING DEEP, HAS HIS MAN! CAUGHT AND TAKEN DOWN TO THE 10 YARD LINE IS CHRISTIAN WATSON. SO YOU FIGURE SOONER OR LATER THAT GUY MIGHT GET FREE, AND IT HAPPENS RIGHT THERE? HAPPENS RIGHT THERE. >> Kirk: AND A GOOD JOB BY THE LINE. HE WORKS BACK TO THE OUTSIDE, PUTS IT RIGHT ON THE MONEY. PROTECTION. GOOD JOB OF LOOKING OFF THAT SAFETY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD, AND ABLE TO JUST HANG IT UP THERE AND LET WATSON RUN RIGHT UNDERNEATH IT. GREAT PLAY. >> Al: 59 YARDS. IT'S THEIR FIRST PASSING FIRST DOWN. FIRST DOWN AT THE 12. PLAY FAKED. PASS IS DROPPED. THAT'S WATSON. IT'S SO FUNNY TALK ABOUT WATSON AND WHAT HE'S DONE, HE'S THE BIG PLAY GUY. IN HIS LAST SEVEN CATCHES HE'S AVERAGED 40 YARDS PER RECEPTION. >> Kirk: HE'S REALLY GROWN BECAUSE WHEN HE FIRST CAME INTO THE LEAGUE THAT'S WHAT HE WAS. HE'S A VERTICAL DOWNFIELD THREAT. AS HE'S GROWN, HE'S GOTTEN BETTER AT RUNNING DIFFERENT ROUTES, BUT THIS IS AN OFFENSE THAT NEEDED SOMETHING TO IGNITE THEM AND PUSH THIS DEFENSE BACK A BIT. HAD 31 YARDS PASSING IN THE ENTIRE FIRST HALF, AND IN THAT COMPLETION 59 AT ONE >> Al: 2nd AND 10. PLAY ACTION. GOING TO THE CORNER OF A LITTLE CONTACT THERE, BUT INCOMPLETE. AGAIN, WATSON COVERED THAT TIME BY CARLTON DAVIS. >> GUYS, THE LIONS FOR RULED OUT DEFENSIVE LINEMAN ALIM McNEILL FROM THIS GAME BECAUSE OF A HEAD INJURY. NOT A CONCUSSION BUT A HEAD INJURY. >> Al: WE SAW HIM GO INTO THE LOCKER ROOM, BUT HE'S DONE. 3rd AND 10. >> Kirk: THEY GET TO THESE THIRD DOWNS, THEY'RE DOWN ON PRESSURE FROM THE LINE BACKERS AND TRYING TO GET AFTER LOVE AND PLAY MAN-TO-MAN COVERAGE BEHIND IT. LET'S SEE WHAT THEY DO >> Al: DELAYED BLITZ. THE PASS TO THE END KRAFT, TOUCHDOWN. WOW, TUCKER KRAFT. AND BOY, DID THEY NEED THAT DRIVE. >> Kirk: BOY, WHAT A THROW. AND HOW ABOUT A MATCHUP WITH YOUR BIG TIGHT END. THIS GUY 6'5", 260 POUNDS. AND HE PUT A LOT OF -- A LOT OF HEAT ON THAT. I MEAN THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE HAD TO DO. HIS BIG BODY, HE HAD LEVERAGE ON THE CORNER. HE HAD TO PUT IT IN THERE BECAUSE HE WAS CLOSING -- DAVIS WAS CLOSING IN IN A HURRY. AND IF HE DIDN'T THROW IT WITH THAT VELOCITY, DAVIS COULD NOT HAVE DREAMT UP A BETTER WAY TO START THIS SECOND 1:45 RIGHT DOWN THE FIELD, AND THEY GET JORDAN LOVE GOING, CAN SOME EMOTION ON THAT SIDELINE FROM THE PACKERS AFTER THAT >> Al: TOUCH BACK >> Kirk: LET'S TAKE A PEEK AGAIN AT THE QUARTERBACK, JORDAN LOVE. WATCH HIS EYES LOOKING. HE'S GOING TO THROW TO THE RIGHT. HE'S JUST KIND OF LOOKING -- THIS IS ALL ON TIMING. HE'S PEEKING, HE'S PEEKING, AND NOW HE SEES THE COVERAGE. AND HE'S GOT TO PUT A LOT ON IT. GETS IT TO THE INSIDE WHERE KRAFT CAN USE HIS BODY, BUT IT'S FUN TO WATCH LOVE AND KIND OF GO INTO HIS MIND THERE, SEEING THOSE EYES, MAKING THAT PERFECT THROW THERE FOR THEIR TOUCHDOWN. >> Al: BEAUTIFUL SHOT OF THAT. THAT'S ALMOST LIKE A VISION TEST. DON'T MOVE YOUR HEAD, JUST YOUR EYES. >> Kirk: KRAFT WAVING -- WAVING EVERYBODY. >> Al: FROM THE 30 GIBBS IS THE BACK. TRIES TO CUT TO THE SWARMED, AND A FLAG EACH TEAM HAS BEEN PENALIZED FIVE TIMES. ACCEPTED PENALTIES. >> Kirk: THEY MAY HAVE GOTTEN SULE, THE RIGHT TACKLE HERE. OFFENSE NUMBER 50. >> Kirk: THERE ISN'T 50 -- I THINK HE MEANT 58, SULE. HE GETS UP WITH KENNY CLARK, WORKING DOWN. KENNY CLARK'S JUST INSIDE OF HIM JUST TRYING TO SEAL. THAT LEFT ARM GETS UP AROUND THE NECK. SO THE PACKERS, THAT'S KIND OF BEEN THEIR TENDENCY THIS YEAR. THAT'S SECOND MOST IN THE NFL. >> Al: 1st AND 20. CATCH IS MADE. BEFORE WE GET AWAY FROM SEWELL AND TALK FOURTH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE, NUMBER ONE PICK OUT OF OREGON BACK IN '21. THIS IS GUY HE'S NOT MISSED A SNAP SINCE THE 2021 SEASON. COMING INTO TONIGHT HE HAD PLAYED 3,103 CONSECUTIVE SNAPS. >> Kirk: YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO SEE THAT AGAIN. HASN'T ALLOWED A SACK BUT HAS BEEN SACKED HIMSELF. >> Al: RIGHT, EXACTLY. >> Kirk: TRIED TO LET THE BIG MAN THROW IT. TELLS YOU WHAT KIND ATHLETE HE IS. >> Al: 2nd AND 14. NOW FIRES. IT'S INTERCEPTED. NIXON WITH THE PICK. AND DOWN THE SIDELINE HE GOES, KEISEAN NIXON WITH THE INTERCEPTION. AND GOFF WHO RARELY THROWS A PICK. IN FACT, IN 8 OF THE LAST 9 GAMES HE'S THROWN NONE. IN ONE GAME HE THREW FIVE AND STILL WON THE GETS PICKED OFF HERE. >> Kirk: HIS EYES I FELT LIKE THEY WENT TO THE MIDDLE OF THE COVERAGE, TO OUR RIGHT THERE. AND THEN DIDN'T REALLY LOOK OUT TO THE RIGHT. HE CAME OFF FROM THE MIDDLE JUST TRYING TO LOOK THE DEFENSE OFF, AND BEFORE HE COULD REALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE A DECISION ON IT, I BETTER NOT MAKE THIS THROW, HE JUST FLIPS IT OUT THERE AND NIXON WHO'S THEIR BEST COVER GUY WITH ALEXANDER DOWN, DID A GREAT JOB OF FIELDING THE ROUTE, STEPS IN FRONT OF IT, AND HERE COME THE PACKERS. >> Al: NIXON HAD NOT HAD A PICK THIS GOFF BARKING AT FIRST DOWN AT THE 16 GIBBS TO THE OUTSIDE. SHORT GAIN. AND BRANCH PAYS THE PRICE. VERY SLOW IN ATTEMPTING TO GET UP, AND NOW HE DOES. SO JACOBS 2nd DOWN AND 8. >> Kirk: WHAT A BLOCK BY ZACH TOM. HE AND SEAN RYAN CAME IN TOGETHER. LIKE I SAID TOM GETS OFTEN. THAT TIME HE'S ABLE TO SET THAT EDGE ON THAT >> Al: JOHN RYAN BACK IN. JACOBS 11, CARRIES 50 LOVE FIRES, CAUGHT, AND TRYING TO REACH FOR THAT FIRST DOWN IS LOOKS TO BE -- YEP, HE'S GOT THAT FIRST >> Kirk: YOU MENTIONED WHEN WE FIRST CAME BACK HERE IN THE SECOND HALF, ROMEO DOUBS IS OUT. AND IT'S GIVEN DONTAYVION WICKS MORE OPPORTUNITIES TONIGHT. REALLY GOOD BLOCKERS, HAD SOME DROPS. THAT TIME LOOKED IT IN >> Al: GO IN A HURRY TO AVOIDGY DEFENSIVE CHANGES. AND WORKING HIS WAY IS JOSH JACOBS, FINDING HIS WAY INTO THE END AND THE GREEN BAY PACKERS -- THAT DIDN'T TAKE LONG. TOOK THEM 3 MINUTES AND 45 SECONDS TO ERASE A 10-POINT DEFICIT AND TAKE THE LEAD. >> Kirk: AND, AL, YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT, THAT HURRY-UP -- REMEMBER A LOT OF NEW FACES ON THIS DETROIT THEY WERE COMPLETELY CAUGHT OFF-GUARD. LOOK AT THEM TRYING TO GET EVERYBODY ON THE SAME PAGE. ROBERT MARTIN WHO'S BEEN HERE BUT HADN'T PLAYED A LOT OF FOOTBALL, HE'S NOT ABLE TO GET LINED UP, AND THAT'S A MISTAKE AGAINST A POWERFUL RUNNING JOSH JACOBS WHO BOUNCES ALL THE WAY INTO THE END ZONE FOR THAT TOUCHDOWN. >> Al: SEVEN TOUCH DOWNS IN HIS LAST FOUR GAMES FOR JACOBS. McMANUS FOR THE POINT AFTER. AND JUST LIKE THAT, GREEN BAY 21, DETROIT 17 ON THURSDAY NIGHT HIS PICKS, HE JUST THREW ONE THERE. THAT'S HIS FIRST ONE SINCE -- WELL, SINCE HE THREW FIVE IN ONE GAME AND STILL WON THE GAME IN HOUSTON A FEW WEEKS AGO. MEANWHILE, KICK OFF AND DETROIT WILL START DOWN BY 4. TOUGH ACCOMPLISHMENT. FIVE INTERCEPTIONS IN ONE GAME AND WIN THE >> Al: LOOK AT IT. HE HAD FOUR IN HIS LAST THREE GAMES AND HAD THAT ONE CRAZY GAME IN HOUSTON AND THEN ONE TONIGHT. >> Kirk: YEAH, THIS -- YOU WANT TO SEE A VETERAN BOUNCE BACK FROM THAT. LET'S WATCH GOFF AND THIS OFFENSE. AFTER JUST TAKING A COUPLE BODY BLOWS HERE TO START THE SECOND >> Al: ST. BROWN'S BEEN QUIET. HE WAS IN MOTION THAT GOFF CHECKS IT DOWN. 5-YARD PICKUP HERE FOR 2nd AND 5. STOKES. >> Kirk: THERE'S SOME POPPING GOING ON BOTH THESE DEFENSES ARE FLYING AROUND AND HITTING PEOPLE. HERE THEY GO TEMPO. >> Al: THEY GO HURRY-UP FROM THE 35 GOFF CHECKS IT TO OVER THE MIDDLE IS THEIR FORWARD PROGRESS FOR THE FIRST DOWN. AND THERE APPEARS TO BE HERE FOR KENT PATRICK. RIGHT AT THE 40 AND THAT'S A GOOD DECISION BY BEN JOHNSON AFTER THE INTERCEPTION, GO A BIT OF TEMPO, TRUSTING THE QUARTERBACK TO GET BACK UP ON THE SADDLE. THIS IS A GUY THAT'S BOUNCED BACK, SHOWED YOU RESILIENCY HIS ENTIRE CAREER. >> Al: TOSS IT BACK TRYING TO CUT BACK. GAIN OF 2 FOR JAHMYR >> Kirk: I ASKED JEFF HAFLEY. I SAID, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU FACE A TEAM THAT LOVES TO RUN THE OUTSIDE GAME PLAY AS MUCH AS THEY DO, WHAT DO YOU DO? HE SAID WE'VE GOT TO SET THE EDGE PENETRATION AND STAY ON OUR FEET. THAT WAS A GOOD EXAMPLE RIGHT THERE. THEY SET THE EDGE AND THE DEFENSIVE LINEMEN ABLE TO CLOSE IN BY STAYING ON THEIR FEET ON THAT PLAY. THEY SQUEEZED THE SPACE OUT OF THAT >> Al: GOFF FIRES, AND THAT'S NOT CAUGHT. LAPORTA TRYING TO HAUL IT IN AT THE 43 YARD LINE AND COULD NOT. MANNED COVERAGE. ANY TIME YOU GET THAT KIND OF MANNED COVERAGE, YOU LIKE TO WORK ACROSS. WORK TO THE MIDDLE WHETHER IT'S A MESH CONCEPT AND CROSSERS. GOT TO THE TOP OF THAT ROUTE, GETS OFF AWAY FROM ERIC STOKES AND JUST NOT ABLE TO HOLD ONTO THAT FOOTBALL. LOOKS LIKE A REFEREE MAY BE DOWN. >> Al: OH, YEAH. SO ONE OF THE OFFICIALS NEEDS A MOMENT. THAT'S KARL JOHNSON WHO AT ONE TIME WAS THE HEAD OF OFFICIALS FOR THE NFL, AND THEN HE DECIDED I WANT TO COME BACK OUT ONTO THE AND HE'S A GOOD MAN. HAPPY TO SEE HIM GET UP MAYBE A MOMENT OR TWO HERE. AND WE'LL TAKE A MOMENT OR TWO OFF. ENAGBARE WAS THE GUY WHO ACCIDENTLY RAN INTO HIM. IT'S THE SHOULDER. THEY'VE TAKEN HIM BACK TO THE OFFICIAL LOCKER ROOM, WHICH MEANS YOUR DOWN FROM SEVEN TERRY, WHAT IS THE LOCATION NOW? HE'S THE LINE JUDGE. >> THEY'LL ONLY HAVE ONE OFFICIAL ON GREEN BAY'S SIDELINE. HE'LL ADJUST HIMSELF DEPENDING ON DOWN AND DISTANCE. >> Al: HOPING HE CAN GET BACK IN HERE AS THEY EXAMINE HIM. IN THE OFFICIAL'S MEANWHILE, A QUICK PASS HERE CAUGHT BY AND WILLIAMS IS OUT TO THE 40 YARD LINE, TACKLE THERE BY KENNY CLARK. THAT WAS A 3rd AND 8. NOW YOU'VE GOT A 4th AND 1 AT MIDFIELD. >> Kirk: BIG THING RECOGNIZE IS SPOTTING INSTEAD OF HAVING TWO OFFICIALS THAT CAN COME IN ONE FROM ONE SIDELINE, ONE FROM THE OTHER, IT'S ONLY COMING FROM THE NEAR SIDELINE NOW, THE DETOIT SIDE >> Al: AND IT'S 4th AND 1. THEY LINE UP TO GO FOR HE'LL KEEP IT GOFF TAKES IT TO THE 49 BEHIND RAGNOW. >> Kirk: NICE, EASY, SAFE CALL UNDER CENTER. REMEMBER WHEN PEOPLE USED TO DO THIS INSTEAD OF SHOTGUN ON 4th AND 1? IT'S PRETTY EFFECTIVE. YOU GET UNDER CENTER, YOU JUST QUARTERBACK SNEAK. DOESN'T IT WORRY YOU YOU WATCH A GAME AND SEE SHOUT GUN ON 4th SEE IT ALL OVER COLLEGE FOOTBALL. >> Al: EXCEPT IN PHILADELPHIA. >> Kirk: NEVER SEE IT. PLAY FAKE. SCREEN SETUP. NICE LOOKING PLAY. AND A 13-YARD PICKUP THERE FOR DAVID BEAUTIFULLY SETUP. HAD A FULL CONVOY, PICKS UP 13. ARE A GREAT STREAM TEAM. THEY JUST HAVE A SENSE OF WHEN TO START GOING TO THESE RPOs IN A STREAM GAME. GOOD JOB, LOOK AT THE LINEMEN DOWNFIELD. THE TIMING OF IT PERFECT WHETHER IT'S GIBBS OR MONTGOMERY. REALLY GOOD JOB OF LOOKING THAT OFF AND THEN DUMPING IT DOWN. AND AGAIN, THE ROOM TO FOR THAT FIRST DOWN. >> Al: ROLLING, LOOKING, KEEPING. GAINS 8. JARED GOFF ON THE MOVE. HE'S A POCKET QUARTERBACK, BUT THEY GO SO MUCH PLAY WAGGLES AND BOOTS, THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S DOWNFIELD, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO THINK ABOUT HIM TAKING OFF AND GOING, THEN HE'S EASILY GOING TO EAT UP THAT SPACE. I MEAN THERE IS NOTHING BUT GRASS THERE, AND HE TAKES 8 OR 9 YARDS. >> Al: 2nd AND 1. HALFWAY THROUGH THE THIRD QUARTER. EASY YARD. GETS THAT, AND A LOT MORE! DOWN THE SIDELINE GOES >> Kirk: KARL BROOKS ALMOST TOOK HIS HAND-OFF. 94 RIGHT HERE. THEY TALK ABOUT HOW HE HAS TWITCH. WHAT A GOOD GET OFF. GOFF, HE SHOULD HAVE GONE FOR THE BACK, BLOWN THAT PLAY UP. HE JUST GETS AN ARM ON GOOD JOB OF HOLDING ONTO THE FOOTBALL, AND THERE'S THAT ACCELERATION. IT'S AS GOOD AS ANYBODY IN THE NFL FROM JAHMYR GIBBS. >> Al: SO 1st AND GIBBS HAS NOW GONE OVER 1,000 YARDS FOR JACOBS DID IT FOR GREEN BAY EARLIER IN THE GAME. STRAIGHT DROP. AND THEN THROWN WAY OUT OF THE END ZONE. LaPORTA-WELL COVERED. >> Kirk: THEY TALKED ABOUT RED ZONE, THEY'RE SIXTH IN THE NFL. LAST WEEK 205 TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE TAMPA GAME 1-7. THEY DIDN'T HAD A HANDFUL OF GAMES WHERE IT'S NOT CLICKED. IN A GAME YOU START TO FEEL NOW, THESE QUARTERBACKS ARE STARTING TO WARM UP, THESE POINTS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT. WHERE HE TRIES TO FIND THIS MATCHUP. YOU MENTIONED ST. WE'VE NOT SEEN HIM GET MANY OPPORTUNITIES, AND THERE HE IS IN >> Al: HE'S CAUGHT THREE TONIGHT FOR 68 THERE GOES GIBBS TO HE TAKES McDUFFIE DOWN AND 3rd AND GOAL. >> Kirk: REMEMBER THEY WERE DOWN HERE AND GOT ALL THE WAY DOWN RIGHT BEFORE THE HALF, AND WE THOUGHT WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO TRY TO FIND A MATCHUP? THEY ENDED UP GOING TO GIBBS WHO WAS ONE-ON-ONE AGAINST A LINEBACKER. IT WAS A MISMATCH AGAINST McDUFFIE. >> Al: AND IT PAID OFF WITH A TOUCHDOWN. 3rd AND GOAL. SACKED THREE RECEIVERS TO THE LEFT. AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A 4th DOWN FROM ABOUT THE 2 YARD LINE AS GIBBS TAKES IT MAYBE A YARD. SO 4th AND GOAL. >> Kirk: YOU KNOW THEY RAMMED THAT PLAY TO GET READY FOR THIS 4th DOWN CALL. AND CAMPBELL HAS A VERY AGGRESSIVE APPROACH TO THESE PLAY THOSE LINEBACKERS GOT DOWNHILL IN A HURRY THAT PLAY REALLY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF A CHANCE TO GET INTO THE END ZONE. ALL THE WAY DOWN THE 3 YARD LINE HERE ON 4th >> Al: ST. BROWN IS IN THE BACKFIELD. THE PASS IS CAUGHT FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. CEN PATRICK! >> Kirk: WE SAW GREEN BAY SCORE A TOUCHDOWN WITH TEMPO. LOOK AT THE GREEN BAY JUST LIKE DETROIT, MIDDLE LINEBACKER EVERYBODY LINED UP, A LOT OF CONFUSION AND AN EASY READ FOR GOFF ON THAT TOUCHDOWN TO >> Al: IT'S REALLY GREAT TO SEE THIS GUY HE MISSED TWO FULL SEASONS, HAD A COUPLE OF SURGERIES. LOOKED LIKE HIS CAREER MAY BE OVER. GREAT PLAYER IN DENVER, COMES HERE. FIRST TD FOR HIM SINCE 2021. EXTRA POINT BY BATES GO. GREEN BAY TOOK THE LEAD, NOW DETROIT HAS IT BACK. 24-21 ON THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL. OF OFFICIALS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS, BUT MISSED THE ACTION. WANTED TO GET BACK TO WORK IN THESE GAMES, AND WE'VE SEEN HIM A LOT ON THE JOHN HUSSEY CREW. MEANWHILE YOU'VE GOT THE KICK OFF HERE AND THE TOUCH BACK THERE. >> Kirk: NICE TOUCH BY JARED GOFF AFTER THAT THE BALL IS ON THE GROUND, EXCITED. DPAUF WITH PRESENCE OF MIND THINKING, HEY, MY GUY HADN'T SCORED A WHILE. I THINK I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS ONE OVER TO MY GUY TIM PATRICK. >> Al: HE'S A REALLY SOLID GUY AND MEANS SO MUCH IN THAT WIDE RECEIVER ROOM. >> Kirk: TALKED TO ANTWAAN BEFORE THE GAME AND SAID HE'S A GREAT RECEIVERS COACH. AND REALLY SET THE TONE IN THAT ROOM HELPING OUT ST. BROWN AND OTHERS. >> Al: SO NOW GREEN TWO QUICK TOUCH DOWNS TO START THE QUARTER. WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE? GOT A LITTLE FLEAFLICKER AND LOVE PUMPS, THROW. A LOT 06 NOTHING FOR ALL OF THAT ACTION. >> Kirk: YEAH, HE HAD A CHANCE IF HE HAD BUT ONCE AGAIN THESE GUYS, YOU KNOW, THEY JUST GOT HERE. THIS WAS MYLES ADAMS WHO'S JUST RECENTLY BEEN SIGNED. HE'S UP THERE LINED UP AT THE NOSE. THIS PLAY TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. SEE PRESSURE RIGHT THERE COMING THROUGH THE TIGHT END, BEN SIMS. HE'S LUCKY TO KEEP HIS FEET, BUT HE HAD OPEN RECEIVERS DOWNFIELD. JACOBS AND BROOKS TO GIVEN TO JAKEBS WHO'S FOLLOWING BROOKS. TACKLED BY BRODRIC MARTIN, 3rd AND LONG. >> Kirk: THEY HAD EVERYBODY WALKED UP CLOSE, HAD EIGHT UP CLOSE TO THE LINE OF WITHIN 2 OR 3 YARDS, THEY STILL TRIED TO RUN INTO THAT AARON GLENN DEFENSE. INDEED. 3rd AND 8. >> Kirk: SEE SOME OF THE CONFUSION THERE WITH SOME OF THE NEWER FACES. >> Al: CLAP, CLAP, CLAPPING. GREEN BAY TRYING TO GET A CALL HERE. DETROIT'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND GREEN BAY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON. >> Kirk: HE DID GET THE TIMEOUT, OKAY. FLAG CAME OUT, AND HE JUST GOT THE TIMEOUT. YOU'RE RIGHT, WE SAW MOVEMENT ON ONE SIDE AND CONFUSION ON GREEN THIS IS PRETTY BIG LOVE DID NOT WANT TO HAVE TO USE ONE OF THESE TIMEOUTS BUT REALLY FORCED TO >> Al: YEAH, NOT IN A GAME LIKE THIS. THAT COULD COME BACK TO BITE YOU AT THE END. 3rd AND 9. IT'S BLOCKED WELL. THE PASS IS GOING TO BE HAULED IN BY CHRISTIAN WATSON, BUT SHORT OF THE FIRST ROOKIE ARNOLD MAKES A CAMPBELL PUT THE PRESSURE ON. 4th AND 3. YOU, IF DETROIT WINS THIS GAME PAT O'CONNOR, 95, HE'S GOING TO GET A GAME WITH D.J. READER, NOW McNEILL OUT IN THE MIDDLE, THAT'S A REAL STRENGTH. IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT GETTING THE SACK. IT'S ABOUT GETTING OFF HERE HE IS IN THE MIDDLE, MATCHED UP ONE-ON-ONE WITH JOSH MYERS. DOES ENOUGH HERE TO BE ABLE TO PUSH AND GET IN THE FACE TO GET THAT BALL OUT SOONER THAN HE WANTED. >> Al: EASTERN MICHIGAN PRODUCT. MEANWHILE, FAIR CATCH CALLED FOR MADE AT THE 21 YARD LINE. DETROIT WITH THE BALL, APPRECIATE, LET'S JUST SETTLE DOWN. >> Al: OFFENSIVE WORD. START THIS DRIVE FROM THE 22 YARD LINE. MONTGOMERY IS THE CHECK IT DOWN. AND HE GETS GANG TACKLED AFTER A GAIN OF A COUPLE. NIXON THE FIRST GUY 2nd DOWN AND 7. >> Kirk: JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT ST. BROWN HAS NOT BEEN INVOLVED A LOT TONIGHT IN GETTING CHANCES. FOUR TARGETS, THREE CATCHES, ONLY 16 ONE OF THE TOP RECEIVERS IN THE NFL. YOU KNOW WHAT? HE'S NOT OUT THERE MOPING. HE'S NOT COMPLAINING. HE'S OUT THERE BLOCKING HIS ASS OFF AND JUST BEING A GREAT TEAMMATE. HIS TIME WILL COME AT SOME POINT TONIGHT. >> Al: CAUGHT 79 IN RUNNING INTO A WALL THAT TIME IS SO IT'LL BE 3rd DOWN AND ABOUT 6. >> Kirk: YOU KNOW, AT SOME POINT HE'LL GET A ONE-ON-ONE MATCHUP, AND IT'S JUST GREAT TO SEE GOFF DOESN'T FEEL HE HAS TO FORCE THE BALL TO HIS GUY. NOBODY WANTS TO GET THE BALL MORE TO ST. BROWN THAN GOFF. BUT THE MATCHUPS RIGHT NOW HAVE NOT ALLOWED FOR THAT TO HAPPE BUT IT WILL. AND THE FACT HE'S NOT FORCING IT AND THE FACT ST. BROWN IS JUST DOING HIS JOB, IT'S REFRESHING TO SEE. >> Al: 3rd AND 6. WILLIAMS MOVING. GOFF OVER THE MIDDLE. GOFF FIRES, AND THAT'S GOING TO BE CAUGHT. IS IT A FIRST DOWN? THAT'S PATRICK MAKING THE GRAB, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE MARKED A YARD SHY. SO WITH UNDER 2:00 TO PLAY IN THE QUARTER, 4th DOWN, 4th AND 1. YOUR OWN 30 YARD LINE. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? >> Kirk: YEAH, AND DAN CAMPBELL HAS A REPUTATION OF GOING FOR IT. HE'S DONE IT THREE TIMES TONIGHT. HE'S MADE ALL THREE. BUT HERE THEY ARE DEEP IN THEIR OWN IT'S A BIG ONE. >> Al: THREE OUT OF THREE. CAN THEY MAKE IT FOUR OUT OF FOUR OR GIVE IT TO GREEN BAY? TO THE OUTSIDE, TURNS NO, GREEN BAY STUFFS THEM. GIBBS TAKEN DOWN, AND THE PACKERS ARE GOING TO GET IT AT ABOUT THE 30 YARD LINE. >> Kirk: WHAT'S INTERESTING TEE INTERESTING TO ME, AL, IS GOFF HAS HAD OPPORTUNITY TO SNEAK LOOK AT THE GAP HERE, HE MAKES A CALL, CAN, CAN, CAN. THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE A SWEEP TO GET TO THE OUTSIDE, BUT LOOK AT THE REACTION FROM THIS THEY ARE FLYING. THEY KNOW THE OPPORTUNITY THEY HAVE. SECONDARY COMING UP, THAT WAS BULLARD, AND EVENTUALLY QUAY WALKER MAKES THE PLAY TO KEEP HIM SHORT OF THAT GREAT PLAY BY THAT >> Al: SO A 1:30 TO GO IN THE THIRD. THREE-POINT GAME. DETROIT ON TOP. LIONS TRYING TO WIN 11 STRAIGHT. PACKERS TRYING TO AT LEAST KEEP PACE AND GET TO WITHIN A GAME OF THEM IN THE STANDINGS. A LOT AT STAKE REED IN MOTION, CIRCLES BACK, KEEP IT ON THE GROUND. 4-YARD GAIN FOR JOSH TO THE 26 YARD LINE. 2nd AND LET'S CALL IT 7. 3-YARD PICKUP. >> Kirk: YOU LOOK AT THAT DECISION, IT'S EASY TO SAY WHAT THE HECK IS HE DOING DEEP IN HIS OWN TERRITORY? BUT, LISTEN, YOU LIVE BY THE SWORD. WHEN IT WORKS AND THEY END UP GOING DOWN A LINK TO THE FIELD AND PUTTING POINTS ON THE BOARD EVERYONE'S GOING TO GO GOOD OLD DAN CAMPBELL, HE'S ALREADY THREE FOR THREE RISKY, OF COURSE, YOU GIVE IT TO JORDAN LOVE HERE, BUT HE'S LIVING UP TO WHAT HE DOES. YOU CAN'T QUESTION IT WHEN HE DOES IT AND IT WORKS. >> Al: YEAH, A THIN LINE BETWEEN A GENIUS AND A BUM. MEANWHILE, FREE, JUGGLES, MAKES THE CATCH. WHAT A POPPY, LOOK AT THE WAY HE GETS UP, TOO! GRAB, HIT BY JACK CAMPBELLS, SPRINGS TO HIS FEET. SETS UP 1st AND GOAL. >> Kirk: EIGKWON ALEXANDER. AND THIS TIME THAT DEFENSE BROUGHT A LOT OF PRESSURE. NOBODY OF THAT SECOND LEVEL OF THE DEFENSE. AGAIN, THIS GUY MAKING A PLAY. THAT'S 260 POUNDS MOVING AROUND LIKE >> Al: THAT'S A GOLD MEDAL IN THE OLYMPICS WHEN YOU PULL THAT CLOCK TICKING DOWN TO THE END OF THE DON'T HAVE TO RUN A AND THEY DON'T. THAT'S THE END OF THE TRYING TO GET HIM TO JUMP OFFSIDE. HERBSTREIT, KAYLEE HARTUNG. 3-POINT GAME. DETROIT HAS THE LEAD, BUT THE PACKERS FOR A 1st AND GOAL AT THE 6. CROWD FULL VOLUME. JACOBS IS THE BACK. SIMS SETS UP IN THE AND AFTER A LONG COUNT, PLAY ACTION. SURVEYING, HAS TIME, THROW'S CAUGHT. AND THAT WAS VINCE SIMS, NUMBER 2 TIGHT END WHO HAD SETUP IN THE BACK FIELD. RUNS A ROUTE HERE. >> Kirk: LOVE THE NO PLAY ACTION THERE. AS EXPECTED OF JOSH THINK ABOUT THE SCORED 13 POINTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER, ON THE THIRD OF PUNCHING ANOTHER ONE IN, BUT THEY HAVEN'T REALLY HAD TO DRIVE THE LENGTH OF THE FIELD. THEY HAD THE BIG 50 YARD PASS TO WATSON. AN INTERCEPTION GOT THEM AT THE PLUS 30, AND THEN THE STOPS ON DOWNS GETS THEM AT THE PLUS 30. >> Al: JACOBS IN THERE! TOUCHDOWN GREEN BAY. AND THEY HAVE THE LEAD FOLLOW MYERS AND JENKINS THE CENTER AND THE LEFT GUARD. AND BACK AND FORTH WE CONTINUE TO GO. >> Kirk: BOY, THIS IS A HECK OF A IT'S GOING TO BE A HECK OF A FINISH. WATCH THE RIGHT GUARD WHAT A BLOCK, HE DOESN'T NEED A LOT OF ROOM. ONCE HE GETS DOWNHILL WITH THE POWER HE HAS IN THOSE LEGS, NO CHANCE OF SLOWING HIM BOY, HE'S A GREAT A ADDITION TO THIS THAT'S HIS THIRD NIGHT, RIGHT? BRANDON McMANUS WITH THE EXTRA POINT. SO THEY TURN IT OVER ON DOWNS, AND IT'S A 30-YARD DRIVE. AND WE GO BACK TO CAMPBELL'S FOURTH DOWN-PLAY HERE. AGAIN COMING INTO THIS FOURTH DOWN, AND THIS ONE IS DEEP IN HIS OWN MADE THREE, AND INSTEAD OF THE SNEAK HE FELT THE PRESNAP THEY'D TAKEN THAT BUT THE PACKERS SPEED AND RECOGNITION OF THAT PERIMETER RUN GETS THE DEFENSE OFF THE FIELD. AND ONCE AGAIN NUMBER 8 FINDS THE END ZONE, AND THEY MAKE THE LIONS PAY FOR THAT DECISION TO GO FOR IT ON FOURTH DOWN. >> Al: YEAH, BIG STOP QUAY WALKER WAS THE FIRST GUY TO STOP HIM. THEN JOHNSON GOES I SHOULD HAVE CALLED SOMETHING ELSE. >> Kirk: WELL, WE'VE SEEN THEM RESPOND WHEN THEY'VE GOTTEN DOWN. CHAMPIONSHIP TEAMS DO. THESE TWO TEAMS ARE JUST GOING TO KEEP SWINGING TO THESE LAST 14:20. YOU MENTION THE DIVISION, YOU KNOW, WHAT'S GOING ON WITHIN THE DIVISION. BUFFALO COMES INTO TOWN NEXT WEEK. WIN THE NFC HOME FIELD ALL THE WAY THROUGH, AND THEY'RE ON THE ROPES TONIGHT. THEY'VE GOT BUFFALO COMING IN HERE NEXT >> Al: YEAH, BUFFALO GOES TO THE RAMS THIS WEEK, THEN TO FORD SO NOW THE LIONS AGAIN TRAILING. 14:20 LEFT IN REGULATION. 40 SECONDS INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER. SO GOFF TONIGHT 22 OF 31. 178, TWO TOUCHDOWNS AND THE VERY COSTLY >> Kirk: GREEN BAY HAS DONE A VERY GOOD JOB. THIS JEFF HAFLEY DEFENSE NOT GIVING UP THOSE BIG PLAYS, EXPLOSIVE PLAYS. KEEP IN MIND THEY DON'T HAVE JAIRE ALEXANDER OUT THERE, AND THEY'VE PLAYED MORE ZONE THAN THEY WOULD LIKE TO. GOFF SLIDES AWAY, CAUGHT AT THE 40 YARD THAT'S TIM PATRICK. COMES OFF THE TOUCHDOWN GRAB. BRINGS THIS ONE OUT TO ALMOST MIDFIELD. 18 YARDS. >> Kirk: WATCH THE MECHANICS OF THE BALL HANDLING BY 16 ON THIS HE'S AS GOOD AS THERE IS. HE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME ON IT, GOOD JOB. WORKS AROUND SEWELL, THE RIGHT TACKLE, AND THEN FINDS THAT SECOND LEVEL WHERE HE MAKES SO MANY COMPLETIONS. OVER THE MIDDLE, SECOND LEVEL, AND THERE'S YOUR GUY, TIM PATRICK, MAKING A NICE >> Al: YEAH, HE SELLS IT WELL. MEANWHILE, YOU'VE GOT JAVON BULLARD THE SAFETY, THE >> Kirk: I SEE IT >> Al: WE'LL CHECK OUT JOE AND TROY AND LOOK AT THIS. >> Kirk: EXACTLY. >> Al: GO BACK AND FORTH IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING. ZAYNE ANDERSON COMES IN, THE SAFETY NOW WITH BULLARD GOING OFF UNDER HIS OWN POWER. PLAY RESUMES 1st AND 10 FROM THE 48 YARD GOFF OVER THE MIDDLE, FINDS HIS MAN. MONTGOMERY TO THE 45. LOOK AT OUR NEXT GEN STATS POWERED BY AWS. JARED GOFF, WE JUST TALKED ABOUT HOW IF GOOD HE IS WITH THE MECHANICS ON PLAY THEY DO GOOD ON EARLY DOWN UNDER CENTER ON I LOVE TO SEE IT BECAUSE THE RUN GAME MARRIED WITH THE PLAY ACTION WITH GIBBS AND MONTGOMERY REALLY CHALLENGES THE EYE AND DISCIPLINE OF THOSE LINE BACKERS AND SAFETIES OF THIS >> Al: 2nd AND 4. THIS WILL SETUP A 3rd AND 2. MONTGOMERY STOPPED THERE BY KENNY CLARK. >> Kirk: KENNY CLARK'S HAVING A HECK OF A GETTING OFF CLOCKS, USING HIS HANDS, USING HIS QUICKNESS. CRAFTY VET OUT OF UCLA. >> Al: MENTIONED BEFORE THE NOMINEE THIS YEAR FOR THE PACKERS FOR THE WALTER PAYTON AWARD. >> Kirk: YEP. >> Al: FIRST-ROUND PICK BACK IN '16. NINTH YEAR AS A PACKER. GOFF NOW 3rd DOWN AND FIRES, CAUGHT. AND THERE IS ST. BROWN, WHO'S BEEN VERY QUIET SINCE THE FIRST SO BIG CATCH HERE AND A FIRST DOWN FOR >> Kirk: YEAH, YOU JUST HAVE A FEELING THAT THIS FOURTH QUARTER COULD BE HIS JUST TOO MUCH SPACE, WHETHER IT'S GIBBS OR MONTGOMERY SNEAKING OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. HERE HE'S MATCHED UP UNDERNEATH AGAINST QUAY WALKER. SO MANY OPTIONS, SO MANY THREATS AS A DEFENSE YOU'RE CONCERNED, YOU'RE TRYING TO PREVENT A BIG PLAY. AND A SMART DECISION TO JUST CHECK IT DOWN TO HIS GUY ST. BROWN >> Al: GAIN OF ABOUT 2 OR 3 FOR JAHMYR GIBBS. TO THE 31. WALKER MAKING A REMEMBER TALKING TO PAYTON MANNING ONE TIME HE WAS SO GOOD AT INDIANAPOLIS THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER WITH THE PLAY ACTION MECHANICS. AND HE USED TO FILM HIMSELF FROM SO MANY DIFFERENT ANGLES AND WORK SO HARD TO MAKE THE UNDERNEATH CENTER HAND-OFF AND THE PLAY ACTION FAKE LOOK IDENTICAL, TO MAKE THOSE LINE BACKERS A LITTLE HESITANT NOT JUST ON THE PLAY ACTION BUT THE RUN GAME AS WELL. >> Al: PAYTON'S BEEN SELLING EVERYTHING SINCE THEN, TOO. >> Kirk: DOING A GREAT JOB. >> Al: GOFF FIRES AND INSIDE THE 20 YARD LINE LaPORTA MAKES THE >> Kirk: I MEAN WE'RE SEEING SOME TIGHT END PLAY TONIGHT. TUCKER KRAFT WITH GREEN BAY, AND LaPORTA REALLY HAD TO WORK TO GET OPEN. I LOVE HOW THEY'RE ABLE TO FLEX HIM OUT BECAUSE OF HIS SKILL SET AT 6'3", 245. YOU SEE HE DIPPED UNDERNEATH THAT TIGHT COVERAGE TO REGAIN LEVERAGE, AND WHAT A BALL OUT IN FRONT WHAT A HECK OF A THROW, AND CONCENTRATION. ALL HANDS FROM SAM LaPORTA. >> Al: FIVE GRABS FOR FAKE TOSS AND KEEP IT INSIDE. THIS IS ST. BROWN FOR A FIRST DOWN. BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED >> Kirk: YEAH, IT SURE SO MUCH ATTENTION ON EVERYBODY'S EYES ARE THINKING THE BALL'S COMING OUT HERE. AND HERE COMES THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE OFFENSIVE LINE LEADING ST. BROWN. YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET HIM THE BALL THROWING IT TO HIM. YOU JUST WANT HIS HANDS ON THE BALL. AGAIN, HE'S BEING REWARDED FOR THE KIND OF PLAYER HE HAS BEEN. HE'S BEEN QUIET. THERE'S SEWELL WHO'S SO MUCH FUN TO WATCH SMART MAN ST. BROWN GETTING BEHIND 58. IT'S LIKE A BODYGUARD FOLLOWING HIM >> Al: MONTGOMERY. IT'S PUNCHED UP AT THE 4. 10 MINUTES TO GO IN AFTER A QUIET FIRST I GOT TO SEE YOU THIS JUST BECAUSE THIS IS ANOTHER PLAY THAT SHOWS ST. BROWN'S ATTITUDE. CARTED OFF. WATCH ST. BROWN'S BLOCK HERE. BANG, THAT'S WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING ALL NIGHT. THAT'S McKINNEY WHO DIDN'T APPRECIATE HE'S AN ALPHA HIMSELF ON THE OTHER SIDE. >> Al: NO QUESTION. XAVIER McKINNEY WITH SEVEN INTERCEPTIONS SO FAR THIS SEASON. BULLARD GOES BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM ON A CART. MEANWHILE, A TOSS BACK HERE TO MONTGOMERY. AND HE CANNOT GET IN. PLAY IS BLOWN DEAD. IT'LL BE 3rd AND GOAL. GOT TWO PLAYS. THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL ON THESE FOURTH DOWNS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ONE DEEP IN THEIR OWN TERRITORY THAT BACKFIRED ON THEM WHERE GREEN BAY GOT THE GO AHEAD SCORE. >> Al: SO PATRICK GOES WIDE LEFT THIS TIME. TO THE END ZONE. CAUGHT! TIM PATRICK AGAIN. >> Kirk: TALK ABOUT HIS MECHANICS. EVEN ON THIRD DOWN UNDER CENTER, HE WANTS TO FREEZE THOSE GOOD JOB. HE KNOWS WANTS TO GO. HE SEES THE MATCHUP, GETS BACK TO TIM WHO TIM PATRICK RAN A HECK OF A ROUTE BEING ABLE TO SEPARATE FROM ERIC STOKES THERE. HE'S GOT TWO FOOTBALLS FIRST TOUCHDOWN SINCE 2021 FACED WITH THE AND DETROIT HAS THE LEAD AGAIN. 31-28. TO TALK ABOUT YOU MISS AARON JONES, BUT JUST A DIFFERENT KIND OF RUNNER. AND HE'S BROUGHT THAT PHYSICALITY, WHICH MATCHES THEIR PLAY ACTION GAME PERFECTLY. ESPECIALLY AS THE WEATHER CHANGES AND YOU'RE IN LAMBO AND BICKTURE THOSE GAMES COMING UP. KEEP HEALTHY. >> Al: THIS GUY'S FOUR YEARS YOUNGER. THAT FACTORS IN, TOO. KAYLEE. >> THE LIONS DEFENSE IS TRYING TO HOLD IT TOGETHER. WHILE THEY WERE ON THE SIDELINE COACH SHEPPARD WAS YELLING I DON'T WANT ANOTHER MISSED ASSIGNMENT. THERE WAS BRANCH GETTING HIS MASSAGE LOOKING UNCOMFORTABLE. BUT Za'DARIUS SMITH JUST BEFORE THEY RETURNED TO THE FIELD SAID RIGHT NOW, RIGHT NOW IT'S GOING TO BE ON US. >> Al: THAT'S CRAZY. THEY WERE SO GREAT IN THE FIRST HALF, BUT MEANWHILE THE PACKERS THREE TOUCHDOWNS ON THEIR FOUR POSSESSIONS IN THIS HALF. START HERE WITH A FLAG BEFORE THE PLAY. O'CONNOR WANTS THE CROWD TO REALLY GET INTO IT. >> Referee: FALSE START OFFENSE NUMBER 50. 5-YARD PENALTY. >> Al: TACKLE ZACH THE HUNGRIEST FAN BASE IN ALL OF FOOTBALL. HAS NEVER BEEN TO A SUPER BOWL. THIS WILL BE SUPER BOWL LIX COMING UP. CAN THEY GET TO NEW ORLEANS. 49ers WOND UP WINNING >> Kirk: WORTH MENTIONING FOR PEOPLE JUST TUNING IN THIS TEAM HAS BEEN DECIMATED WITH THREE OTHER STARTERS DOWN, AND YET THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME PLAYS TONIGHT TO WIN THIS GAME. >> Al: 1st AND 15, A 1-YARD PICKUP HERE. CAUGHT THAT TIME BY CARLTON DAVIS, ANOTHER ONE OF THE OFF-SEASON PICKUPS FROM TAMPA >> Kirk: I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING DAN CAMPBELL SAID WE BROUGHT IT UP TO HIM. YOU GET TERRION ARNOLD IN A DRAFT, PICK UP FROM TAMPA AND GET AMIK IN FREE AGENCY. LAST PIECE. WE HAD TO GET BETTER AT CORNER TO FREE UP AARON GLENN WITH WHAT HE LIKES TO DO. AND EVEN WITH THOSE INJURIES, THEY'RE MAINTAINING THAT AGGRESSIVE APPROACH BECAUSE THEY ARE HEALTHY AT CORNER. >> Al: AGAIN, ALLOWING THE SECOND FEWEST POINTS IN THE LEAGUE COMING INTO THE GAME. LOVE ESCAPES. IT'S CAUGHT. IT'S JUGGLED, HAULED IN BY WATSON. ANOTHER BIG PLAY FOR THAT TIME JACK CAMPBELL ALMOST HAD THE SACK. >> Kirk: BOY, DID HE TIME THIS UP PERFECTLY. AND FOR WHATEVER REASON JACOBS MISSES THIS BLITZ PICKUP. BUT WHO BAILS HIM OUT? THE QUARTERBACK. A HEALTHY JORDAN LOVE ABLE TO STEP AWAY FROM THAT PRESSURE. HOW ABOUT THE LOCATION OF THIS FOOTBALL? RESETS THE FEET, THROWS IT, RIGHT ON THE MONEY. MAYBE AN INCH OR TWO OVER THE OUTSTRETCHED ARMS THERE OF CARLTON >> Al: WATSON NOW FOUR CATCHES TONIGHT, 114 FROM THE 45. JACOBS TRIES TO CUT IT UH-OH, LONG TAKES HIM 2nd AND 10 AS THE CLOCK RUNS DOWN WITH 7 MINUTES LEFT IN >> Kirk: LOOK AT MUHAMMAD THERE SHOWING GREAT DISCIPLINE ON THAT BACKSIDE. ALWAYS GOT TO BE AWARE WITH JACOBS HE'S GOING ANYWHERE. IF HE GETS CLOSED DOWN IN ONE SPOT, DOES SUCH A GOOD JOB WITH FIELD AND VISION TO CUT IT MUHAMMAD THAT TIME COMPLETELY TAKES IT >> Kirk: THIS IS ALL YOU COULD HOPE FOR. 31-28, 6:30 TO GO. >> Al: I'LL SAY. BROOKS IS THE RUNNING LOVE, FIRES OVER THE LINE AND SPUN DOWN, DONTAYVION WICKS FOR A BIG FIRST DOWN. TIME THE OFFENSIVE LINE DOES GIVE HIM JUST ENOUGH TIME. THE POCKET WILL BE COLLAPSING AROUND HIM. GOOD JOB OF JUST KIND OF WAITING AND WAITING ON THIS CROSSER OVER THE MIDDLE. KEEP IN MIND, THEY'RE TOP RECEIVER DOUBS, WHO WOULD BE RUNNING THOSE ROUTES, IS OUT AND WICKS IS ABLE TO STEP UP, THE SECOND YEAR MAN OUT OF VIRGINIA. GOES UP, CLIMBS THE LADDER TO MAKE THAT >> Al: AND BRANCH IS HURT ON THE PLAY. BRYAN BRANCH. DOWN TO THE 35 YARD LINE AFTER A A THURSDAY YOU KNOW, WE LOOKED AT THE LIONS SCHEDULE, MENTION BUFFALO. LOOK AT PHILLIES SCHEDULE. THIS IS BIG NIGHT TONIGHT FOR DETROIT BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY HAVE REMAINING ON COMPARED TO WHAT PHILADELPHIA HAS ON THEIR SCHEDULE. LOOKED LIKE HE WAS CRAMPING THEREAFTER HE TRIED TO MAKE THAT HERE'S A DETROIT >> Al: BUFFALO, OF COURSE, TOUGH ONE. GO TO CHICAGO, GO TO SAN FRANCISCO, AND THEN WRAP IT UP WITH MINNESOTA HERE IN WEEK 18. >> Kirk: REMEMBER, MINNESOTA WILL BE EVERYTHING THEY HAVE IN WEEK 18. AND SAN FRANCISCO IN THE NFC WEST, THEY'RE GOING TO BE PLAYING LIKE THEY'RE PLAYING PLAYOFF FOOTBALL, TRYING TO GET ANY WIN. >> Al: SOMEBODY'S GOT TO WIN THAT DIVISION. BRANDON JOSEPH COMES IN REPLACING BRYAN BRANCH WHO GOES TO THE SIDELINE HERE. THEY EMPTY THE ON A 1st DOWN FROM THE 19 YARD LINE. FOUR-MAN RUSH. LOVE THROWS, THAT IS AND A FIRST DOWN HERE. SO BACK-TO-BACK TO AND HE WILL BE SLOW IN GETTING BACK UP. >> Kirk: WHAT A JOB HERE OF THE QUARTERBACK, AGAIN. HOPEFULLY WICKS WILL GET HELPED UP. THERE HE IS. LOVE IS ABLE TO WORK THROUGH HIS PROGRESSIONS. WICKS IS STEPPING UP. WE MENTION HOW DOUBS IS NOT AVAILABLE. HOW ABOUT THAT ROUTE? A LITTLE WHIP ROUTE BACK TO THE INSIDE, TAKES A HUGE HIT AND IS ABLE TO HOLD ONTO WORKS THROUGH THE PROGRESSIONS, THE LINES, ABLE TO HOLD AND IF YOU'RE A GREEN BAY PACKERS FAN, YOU'RE ON THE ROAD IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, ISN'T IT GREAT TO SEE JORDAN LOVE HEALTHY THESE LAST FOUR WEEKS? WHAT A DIFFERENCE FROM WHERE HE WAS EARLY WHEN HE HAD TO DEAL WITH THE GROIN WEEKS 8 AND 9, THE KNEE WEEKS 2 AND 3. >> Al: WHAT A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIRST HALF AND THE >> Kirk: OH, YEAH. GOOD CALL. HE'S NOW THROWN FOR 206 YARDS. 1st AND GOAL FROM THE PUNCHED UP AT THE 5. MUHAMMAD LOSES HIS HELMET. A LOT OF EMOTION. YOU KNOW, THE NFC NORTH, TELL ME WHAT'S NOT A RIVALRY IN THAT DIVISION. >> Kirk: YEAH, IT'S A LOT OF FUN EVERY SINGLE WEEK. SEEMS TO BE A GREAT MATCHUP. AND THE EMOTION ALWAYS FLYING. AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS GAME, UNDER 5 MINUTES TO GO. WHAT A WEAPON TO HAVE IN JOSH JACOBS ALWAYS IS A THREAT. AND WITH THE WAY YOUR QUARTERBACK'S PLAYING AND THE DECISION MAKING HE'S MAKING FOR YOU RIGHT NOW, YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF WAYS TO ATTACK DOWN HERE. LOVE THROWS, CAUGHT. FLAG'S ALL OVER THE PLACE. SO JACOBS GOT INTO THE END ZONE, BUT YOU SAW THE FLAGS COME IN. >> Kirk: I THINK THEY MAY HAVE AN ILLEGAL SCREEN OR A PICK ON THE OFFENSE. CHRISTIAN WATSON, HE KNOCKED OUT KERBY HE'S TRYING TO RUN HIS ROUTE AND SELL IT. >> Referee: PASS INTERFERENCE OFFENSE, NUMBER 9. >> Kirk: THAT WAS ALMOST LIKE A CRACK BLOCK. HE'S OUT ON THE RIGHT, BACK TO THE AND, BANG, RIGHT THERE HITS 31. THAT'S WHAT FREED UP JACOBS OUT OF THE >> Al: AND IT MOVES THE BALL BACK TO THE 16. 4:30 TO GO. >> Kirk: SEE THE COMMAND THERE. JORDAN LOVE CLAPPING. MARCHING WATSON OVER THE LEFT. NOW HE MOVES REED. >> Al: REED SETS UP IN THE SLOT. THREE RECEIVERS TO THE LOVE, LOOKING, SURVEYING. UNDER PRESSURE, AND THEN JUST THROWS THAT ONE AWAY TO MAKE IT >> Kirk: REALLY GOOD COVERAGE BY THIS YOUNG WE TALKED ABOUT THEY'VE BEEN DECIMATED WITH THE INJURIES, BUT THE ONE AREA WHERE THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO HOLD UP IS THESE GUYS THAT ARE IN COVERAGE AND PLAYING ALL YEAR. ARNOLD, DAVIS, ROBERTSON, THE SECONDARY HAS HELD UP, SO THAT HELP EM SO THAT HELP THEM TO PLAY THIS AGGRESSIVE STYLE. YOU'VE GOT 3rd AND LONG, 3rd AND GOAL SEE IF AARON GLENN DIALS UP PRESSURE. THEY HAVE MOST OF THE NIGHT WITH THOSE >> Al: RUSHED FOR, LOVE TO THE 15, AND THAT'S ALL. TAKEN DOWN BY EZEKIEL TURNER, SO THEY'LL HAVE TO SETTLE FOR A FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT, WHICH WOULD TIE THE >> Kirk: WHAT A PLAY BY TURNER. A GUY THAT'S HAD TO STEP UP WHEN FOUR OF BACKERS ARE INJURED AND NOT PLAYING. YOU'VE GOT TO TURN TO A GUY LIKE EZEKIEL TURNER, WHO CAME OVER FROM SEATTLE OFF THE PRACTICE SQUAD, AND HE MAKES THIS PLAY IN SPACE AGAINST A VERY CAPABLE QUARTERBACK IN LATE BREAKING RECEIVER AS HE'S RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE. TOUGH TO SEE. >> Al: 32-YARD ATTEMPT FOR McMAN SPOT. >> Kirk: HE'S GOT TO BE HAPPY FOR MONTGOMERY JOINING SIMS WITH 12 RUSHING TOUCHDOWNS IN CONSECUTIVE SEASONS. RARE COMPANY FOR >> Al: SO THE LIONS WITH A GAME TIE 3:38. LOOKING DOWN THE STRETCH THE LIONS HAVE ALL THREE TIMEOUTS. AND JARED GOFF WILL GO TO WORK 27-36. SO HE'S 75%, 228 ONLY TUA TAGOVAILOA HAS A BETTER COMPLETION PERCENTAGE THIS SEASON COMING INTO TONIGHT. FROM THE 30. RUNNING BACK IS GIBBS. CAUGHT ALONG THE GAIN OF 19. PLAYING VALENTINE INTO THIS CORNER ON THE DOESN'T DO A GREAT JOB OF SLOWING DOWN HE'S ABLE TO GET TO THAT SECOND LEVEL. HE'S JUST READING 24 THERE, DECIDES TO GO UP AND OVER HIM, AND AN EASY COMPLETION TO GET THIS DRIVE STARTED. >> Al: FIVE CATCHES FOR WILLIAMS. 80 YARDS TONIGHT FROM THE 49. PLAY FAKE AGAIN. ROLLING, THROWING, HE'S FOUND HIS NEW MAN HERE, MR. TIM PATRICK. TWO TOUCHDOWNS, ANOTHER CATCH HERE. TIM PATRICK HAS NOW CAUGHT 6 ON 7 TARGETS. >> Kirk: HE'S IN A GOOD FLOW HERE TO START THIS DRIVE. THE REASON I'VE BROUGHT UP THAT WE'VE SEEN VALENTINE IN A CORNER IS BECAUSE THIS DEFENSIVE BACKFIELD AS THEY APPROACH THIS DRIVE, THEY'VE HAD TO SHIFT SOME GUYS EVAN WILLIAMS IS OUT OF THE GAME. BULLARD IS ALSO OUT OF THE GAME, SO YOU'VE HAD TO TAKE NIXON, 25, FROM OUTSIDE AS A CORNER, PUT HIM TO THE INSIDE TO TAKE OVER FOR BULLARD. SO WILLIAMS AND BULLARD OUT OF THERE. >> Al: YEAH, NIXON A BIG INTERCEPTION LEADING TO A TOUCHDOWN EARLIER. LITTLE TOSS BACK HERE. AND 1 OR 2 YARD GAIN FOR GIBBS INSIDE THE 40 YARD LINE. SECOND DOWN. >> Kirk: HE'S ONE OF THOSE YOUNG, DEFENSIVE ENDS THAT THEY'RE EXCITED ABOUT. THAT TIME IT WAS COX, BRENTON COX WHO FORCED THAT BALL BACK INSIDE. IF YOU'RE DETROIT 2:30 TO GO, TIME IS NOT AN ISSUE. IN FACT, YOU'RE THINKING MORE ABOUT ON THE BACK END ABOUT THE DAN CAMPBELL SLOWING THE WHOLE OPERATION DOWN AFTER THOSE TWO BIG COMPLETIONS ALREADY IN PLUS >> Al: YEAH, TIME MAY BE MOEF OF AN BE MOEF RE OF AN ISSUE FOR GREEN BAY RIGHT BLITZ FROM THE CORNER. PASS TO THE OUTSIDE. SHORT GAIN HERE. >> Kirk: OH, SEPTEMBER THAT INTERESTING? 201 AND IT GOES OUT OF BOUNDS. AND SPEAK OF GREEN BAY HOPING FOR MORE TIME, THAT WAS A BIG PLAY TO GET GIBBS OUT OF >> Al: KARL JOHNSON WHO HAD TO COME OUT WITH A SHOULDER PROBLEM EARLIER, NOW GETTING AN EARFUL FROM LaFLEUR. >> Kirk: THE ONLY WAY YOU STOP GOFF ON THIS PLAY, YOU'VE GOT TO GET PRESSURE ON HIM. IF HE'S CLEAN, IT'S GOING TO BE A COMPLETION. >> Al: DUMPS IT OFF GIBBS LOOKING FOR THE FIRST DOWN, AND HAS ALMOST GOT PUSHED FROM BEHIND THAT TIME BY WYATT TO SECURE THE WITH 1:55 REMAINING. THIS IS THE 2-MINUTE >> Al: ALL RIGHT, SO IT'LL BE FIRST DOWN. MATT LaFLEUR STILL ARGUING. TRYING TO FIGURE IT BY THE CLOCK STOPPING AT 2:01 THAT WOULD WORK TO HIS BENEFIT. >> Kirk: NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. PROBABLY SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S IN PLAY >> Kirk: YEAH, HE WAS PRETTY FIRED UP THE ENTIRE TIME WE WERE >> Al: MEANWHILE, AS PLAY RESUMES, 1st AND 1:55. 31 YARD LINE. SETS IT UP TO STARTED TO SLIP. HOLDS ON, KEEPS HIS BALANCE. >> Kirk: LATE FLAG. >> Al: YEAH, LATE FLAG NIXON MAKING THE STOP. CROWD RESPONDING TO A REPLAY. BUT STILL NO ANSWER FROM SEAN HUSSEY. OFFENSE NUMBER 77. >> Al: IT'S UNDER FRANK RAGNOW. >> Kirk: IT'S AN INTERESTING CALL. IT WAS RIGHT AFTER HE SNAPPED TRIES TO GET OUT THERE TO HELP OUT ON THE -- ON THE SCREEN. IT'S QUAY WALKER TRYING TO GET TO THE AND WE WERE FRAME-BY-FRAME THERE, AND I MEAN IF YOU DO THIS ON ALMOST EVERY PLAY, YOU CAN FIND SOMETHING LIKE THIS. >> Al: OH, FOR SURE. >> Kirk: SO NOW THEY'RE ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE 40 YARD WHAT A HUGE CALL. THEY WERE EASILY IN FIELD GOAL RANGE. >> Al: BATES JUST HAD A GREAT YEAR. READY TO BE CALLED ON. HE GOES FOR THE EXTRA POINT. 1st AND 20. PICKING UP ABOUT 3 IS DAVID MONTGOMERY. >> Kirk: THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO SEE IT AN UNNECESSARY PENTALTY FROM GREEN BAY, AND THAT TIME YOU SAW JUST JUMP ON THE PILE RIGHT IN THAT GRAY AREA. JUST GOT TO AVOID ANY MENTAL ERRORS IF YOU'RE GREEN BAY AND YOU'RE DESPERATELY THIS RANGE. >> Al: TAKE A TIMEOUT >> Kirk: WHISTLE HAD ALREADY BLOWN. SHOWING THAT ON THE BIG SCREEN. >> Al: THAT GETS THE RESPONSE. THAT GETS A RESPONSE FROM LaFLEUR AS WELL. >> Kirk: SO THEY'VE GOT ONE TIMEOUT LEF 1:42. DETROIT WANTS TO MAKE IT A LITTLE -- EVEN THOUGH THIS IS WITHIN BATES' RANGE, YOU WANT TO STILL KIND OF BE AGGRESSIVE AND GIVE HIM A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A CUSHION. >> Al: FOR SURE. >> Kirk: GOT A COUPLE PLAYS HERE TO TRY TO DO THAT. >> Al: RIGHT NOW HE'D BE LOOKING AT A 55-YARD ATTEMPT. 2nd AND 17. GOFF, OVER THE MIDDLE. WIDE OPEN. OUTSIDE THE 20. ST. BROWN, HUGE PLAY. >> Kirk: WELL, YOU KNEW IT WAS COMING. ST. BROWN IS THE GUY. DAVID MONTGOMERY DOES HIS JOB. NOT ONLY IS HE SCORING TOUCHDOWNS TONIGHT, HE PICKS UP ISAIAH McDUFFIE WHO'S COMING ON THIS BLITZ. DOES A NICE JOB OF PICKING THAT UP. HOW OFTEN HAVE WE SEEN DETROIT -- BY THE WAY, McDUFFIE GOT UP AND GOT TO HIM. THAT CROSSER, THAT DIG LITTLE PUSH THERE. THAT'S WHAT NIXON WAS REACTING TO. BUT ST. BROWN GETS AWAY WITH IT. WATCH McDUFFIE GET UP AFTER GOING HEAD OVER HEELS. THEY FORCE GREEN BAY TO USE THAT LAST >> Al: THE FINAL ONE. NOW DETROIT CAN MILK THAT CLOCK. >> Kirk: WE SEE THAT FOLLOW THROUGH. THE RIGHT-HAND HITS THE HELMET OF >> Al: NOW THERE'S A QUESTION WHETHER HE GOT THE FIRST DOWN OR NOT. >> Referee: REPLAY CHANGES AS RESULT OF WE MUST RUN 10 SECONDS. RESET THE GAME CLOCK FOR 1:37. BUT IN LIEU OF THE TO TAKE THEIR THIRD AND FINAL CHARGE >> Al: TERRY MACAULAY WHAT ARE YOU MAKING OF THIS? >> YEAH, THERE'S A LOT OF MISSED WORDS IN THAT ANNOUNCEMENT. IT'S ACTUALLY AN EXPEDITED REVIEW. HE DIDN'T MAKE THE LINE TO GAIN. IT DOES REQUIRE A 10-SECOND RUNOFF, BUT GREEN BAY HAD ALREADY USED THEIR TIMEOUT, WHICH THEY KEPT, WHICH THEY'RE GOING TO DO. IT'S NOW 3rd DOWN AND >> Kirk: AND THEY'RE OUT OF TIMEOUTS. >> Al: THEY'RE OUT OF TIMEOUTS, RIGHT. SO IF THEY PICK UP A FIRST DOWN HERE THEY CAN RUN THE CLOCK OUT AND KICK THE FIELD CAMPBELLS WANTS TO GET AN EXPLANATION. MEANWHILE, GOFF HAS COMPLETED HIS LAST 13 PASSES. HE'S 32 OUT OF 41. 283 YARDS, 3 TOUCHDOWNS TONIGHT. TWO TO PATRICK, ONE TO 3rd AND INCHES. AND DOES HE GET THE FIRST DOWN GREEN BAY, THINKS NOT. NO, HE DIDN'T. YOU'VE GOT ZAYNE ANDERSON WHO COMES UP, STOPS MONTGOMERY NOW, THIS IS FASCINATING DECISION. >> Kirk: HE'S DYING TO GO FOR IT, BUT OBVIOUSLY HE'S GOT TO KICK THIS FIELD GOAL TO POTENTIALLY WIN THIS GAME OR DARE AT LEAST GO AHEAD HERE BY >> Al: SO THIS WOULD BE ABOUT A 38-YARD YOU'RE ALMOST COMPELLED TO DO THAT. IF YOU DON'T MAKE IT AND GOT TO GIVE THE OTHER GUYS THE BALL, YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING OVERTIME. THE PLAY CLOCK IS DOWN AND STOP AT 2, 1, WHATEVER. 44 SECONDS, TIMEOUT, 43 >> Kirk: IF YOU'RE A PACKERS FAN THE PLAY OF THE GAME BY ZAYNE ANDERSON WHO'S HAD TO STEP IN AT SAFETY. HE'S THE GUY THAT KNIFED IN THERE TO SUBMARINE THIS PLAY AND GIVE GREEN BAY SOME TIME. EVEN IF THIS FIELD GOAL IS GOOD, THEY STILL HAVE A SHOT NOW BECAUSE OF THIS EFFORT PLAY BY 39 TO MAKE THAT -- THAT'S A TOUGH MONTGOMERY, BUT A GREAT JOB BY ZAYNE ANDERSON ON THAT 3rd DOWN AND SHORT. THAT'S A HALF A YARD HE NEEDED. REMEMBER, IT TOOK A REVIEW FOR THAT TO THAT WAS A FIRST DOWN. THEY BROUGHT IT BACK A HALF YARD, AND THEN ANDERSON MAKES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET THE BALL BACK EVEN IF THIS IS GOOD AND GIVE JORDAN LOVE SOME TIME TO MAYBE GETS IN FIELD GOAL RANGE. >> Al: SO FOR THE MOMENT THEY ARE LEAVING THE OFFENSE OUT ON THE FIELD. AIN'T THIS FASCINATING? IF NOTHING ELSE DRAW THEM OFFSIDE, YEAH. >> Kirk: GOT THE >> Kirk: MAYBE THE THINKING YOU KNOW ME, I'M THE GUY THAT GOES FOR IT ON 4th DOWN AND THEN CALL YOUR >> Al: HE COULD. OR HE SAYS TO HECK WITH IT. ARE THEY GOING? THEY ARE GOING. AND McDUFFIE IS ABLE TO PICK UP THE FIRST SO GOFF FALLS DOWN AS HE'S MAKING THE HAND-OFF, AND THIS SHOULD SEAL IT. THEY'LL RUN THE CLOCK DOWN, KICK THE FIELD WHAT A CALL! AND THEN GOFF IS STUMBLING WHEN HE'S TRYING TO MAKE THE >> Kirk: I DON'T KNOW. HE MUST HAVE GOTTEN STEPPED OUT WHEN HE CAME OUT. WHAT A GOOD JOB OF KEEPING HIS FOCUS AND STAYING LONG ENOUGH ON LET'S WATCH HIS FEET. YEAH, HE GETS STEPPED ON BY GLASGOW, THE LEFT GUARD. AND SOMEHOW HE REACHES ONCE HE GOT IT TO MONTGOMERY, WHAT A CALL, BY THE WAY. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? 4 OF 5 NOW, COLLEGE BALL HE'S DOWN. THIS IS THE PRO GAME HE'S GOOD TO GO. 4 OF 5 FROM 4th DOWN. >> Al: AMAZING. >> Kirk: HEY, YOU GOT TO BE WHO YOU ARE, RIGHT? >> Al: THAT'S RIGHT. HE'S DAN CAMPBELL. MEANWHILE, NIXON IS SHAKEN UP. YOU'VE GOT TO LUN DAN DON'T FORGET HE'S THE GUY WHO CAME IN AND HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO BITE OFF YOUR KNEECAPS. AND EVERYBODY SAYS WHO IS THIS GOOF. ABOUT NOT GETTING IN THE KICKER CLOSER. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT? TAKING ALL THE TIME AWAY FROM JORDAN LOVE, THE POSSIBILITY OF HIM GETTING THE BALL AND MOVING INTO FIELD GOAL RANGE. HE THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH THE RISK TO GO FOR IT, BELIEVED IN HIS GUYS, GETS THE FIRST DOWN, AND NOW WORKS THAT CLOCK DOWN, KICK A LAST SECOND FIELD GOAL. AND LaFLEUR AND LOVE WON'T GET A CHANCE TO TOUCH THE FOOTBALL. >> Al: AND A MAJOR RISK. AND LOVE WOULD HAVE HAD TO DO IT WITHOUT A THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN EASY EITHER. >> Kirk: JUST GET IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE >> Al: WE'VE HAD A FEW CRAZY ENDINGS ON THURSDAY. MAKE UP FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. ABOUT THAT. >> Al: JUST GETTING IT IN POSITION WHERE BATES WANTED IT TO GET A BETTER SHOT AT IT. SO IT COMES DOWN TO THIS. BATES IS NO STRANGER TO WINNING GAMES AT THE END. 52-YARD GAME WINNING FIELD GOAL AGAINST HOUSTON. HAD A CAREER LONG 58 IN THAT GAME. KICKED A 64-YARDER FOR THE MICHIGAN PANTHERS OF THE UNITED LEAGUE. REMINDER TO STAY TUNED AFTER THE GAME, THE JC PENNEY POST GAME SHOW. KAYLEE WITH THE STAR A LOT TO CHEW ON FOR THAT GAME. KICK HE MADE IN THE UFL, THAT WAS A BOMB. IT'S A DIFFERENT -- A DIFFERENT RISK HERE OR DIFFERENT CHALLENGE, I SHOULD SAY HERE. >> Al: HAVE TO SNAP IT, JACK FOX TO HOLD 35 YARDS TO WIN IT. AND EXTEND THE WINNING STREAK TO 11. BALL GAME! AND WHAT A GAME! 34-31, LIONS. GO TO 12-1. STILL THE NUMBER ONE SEED IN THE NFC. PACKERS DROP TO 9-4. >> Kirk: SO THE TWO GAMES THIS YEAR THAT GOFF AND ALLIANCE PLAYED AGAINST GREEN 6 OF 7 ON 4th DOWN AND FOUR 4th DOWN TOUCHDOWNS. JUST INCREDIBLE THE RISKS HE'S WILLING TO TAKE IN THESE DIVISIONAL MATCHUPS AND PAYS OFF FOR HIM. >> Al: THAT WAS AN A-PLUS OR AN F-MINUS DEPENDING HOW IT WORKED OUT. >> Kirk: RIGHT. GOFF MADE IT EXTRA SPECIAL BY GETTING STEPPED ON, GETTING OUT OF THERE AND STILL GOT THE FOOTBALL TO >> Al: 34-31. SO BATES, HE'S GETTING USED TO THIS. DOES IT AGAIN, YES, SIR. FROM 35 OUT. THAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE. GOFF 32 OF 41. 283 YARDS FOR LaFLEUR ANOTHER TOUGH LOSS. THEY DON'T COME MUCH TOUGHER THAN THAT. OF COURSE, DAN CAMPBELL DIFFERENT REACTION, OBVIOUSLY.N DETROI TT HEWINS I MTOT IORN A
