TO BE WHO WE WANT TO BE. >> DREW BREES WILL BE INDUCTED TONIGHT. LOOK AT THOSE GUYS. A JACK OF ALL TRADES, AND THERE IS DEREK CARR. HE HAD A LINE WHERE YOU SAID CRIME THE RIVER. MEANWHILE THERE IS SEAN PAYTON, HIS RECORD, WINNING SUPER BOWL 44, TRAILING AND THEN A KICK TURNED THEY GAINED AROUND AGAINST THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS. THE SAINTS WILL DEFER SO DENVER WILL START ON OFFENSE YOU GOT A KICKOFF, TREMONT SMITH BACK TO RECEIVE. PACKED HOUSE AT THE SUPERDOME, CELEBRATING ITS 50TH YEAR NEXT SEASON. THIS ENABLES A RUN BACK FROM MARVIN TO COVER THE SIDELINE AND GET TAKEN OUT OF BOUNDS. SO HERE IS THE NUMBER SIX OVERALL PICK IN THE DRAFT AND SIX QUARTERBACK PICK. HE ONLY HAD ONE TOUCHDOWN IN THE FIRST FOUR GAMES IN THE LAST TWO, HE'S 5-5. A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO COVER HIM. >> HE DREAMED HIS WHOLE LIFE OF PLAYING THEIR, ENDS UP IN OREGON, TWO GREAT YEARS, FIRST ROUND PICK FOR DENVER. >> A TON OF EXPERIENCE, THERE HE GOES. HE CAN RUN, HE HAS PROVEN THAT. >> THAT IS SOMETHING FOR A TEAM THAT IS STRUGGLING, THEY HAD BETTER BE READY FOR SHOCK -- SEAN PAYTON. HIS INSTINCT IS TO TAKE OFF WITHOUT ONE WAS WIDE OPEN. >> MARVIN IN THE BACKFIELD. MINIMUM GAIN IF ANY. >> THIS IS AN OFFENSE WITH ROOKIE QUARTERBACK AND ROOKIE RECEIVERS. FRANKLIN TO GO ALONG WITH SUDDEN , THE PLAYMAKER. THEY ARE TRYING TO CHANGE LOOKS UP. >> WILLIAMS WITH A PISTOL. FAKE IT TO HIM AND BO NIX GETS THE FIRST DOWN. THE BLOCK FROM MICHAEL BURTON AND -- >> DEFENSE WILL HAVE TO BE AWARE OF HIS ABILITY TO COME DOWN, PICKS UP A NICE BLOCK. COUPLE OF PLAYS, BO NIX GETTING AN IDEA OF WHAT CAN DO, SPRINKLE IN IRAN WERE TO CALL THE NORMALLY IT IS CREATED BY BUYING IN SOME TIME. >> RAZZLE-DAZZLE HERE AND HE FINDS THE OPEN MAN BUT CANNOT HIT HIM. WIDE OPEN IS LUCAS, NUMBER THREE TIGHT END WIDE OPEN, OVERTH >> GREAT JOB WAY FOR HIM TO CLEAR, BUT YOU WILL SEE HIS FEET, THIS IS THE BIGGEST CONCERN. OFF-BALANCE, NOT ABLE TO GET HIS FEET SECURED. STEP UP IS FINE, NOW MAKE AN ACCURATE THROW. HE IS AN ACCURATE PASSER BUT THROWING THE BALL DOWNFIELD HE HAS NOT DONE A GOOD JOB. >> SECOND DOWN AND 10, GOES AGAINST THE GRAIN, THROWS AGAINST THE GRAIN. INTENDED FOR FRANKLIN, T DOWN AND 10. >> HE HAD FRANKLIN PULLING AWAY FROM HIS DEFENDER, HE HAD HIM OPEN AND THE OPTION, PROBABLY COULD HAVE GOTTEN ANOTHER BIG RUN WHEN HE GOT OUTSIDE. >> THIS TIME THEY SPREAD IT OUT. RECEIVERS TO THE LEFT, BRINGING WILLIAMS BACK INTO THE BACKFIELD. PLAY CLOCK AT TWO MINUTES AND THIRD AND 10, INCOMPLETE BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE AND QUICK FIRST DOWNS FOLLOWED BY A PUNT. >> TAYLOR DID A GOOD JOB DISGUISING THE PRESSURE AND THEN PRESSURE FROM THE THE BALL SNAPPED PRESSURE CAME FROM THE OTHER SIDE, YOU CAN SEE HOW OPEN THE TIGHT END IS BUT THE PRESSURE AFFECTED HIM. >> DIXON IS EARNING HIS KEEP. FAIR>> HAVE YOU EVER BEEN? >> NO. RATTLER THROWS, THEY MAKE THE CATCH. WHAT A START FOR THE ROOKIE WHO MADE HIS FIRST START LAST WEEK. >> HOW ABOUT THAT, THEY COME OUT RIGHT AWAY AND FIND A TIGHT END, NOBODY PICKS HIM UP. MAN TO MAN TEAM BUT COMBINATION OF MAN AND ZONE TONIGHT. >> L YOU'VE GOT RATTLER, ONE OF THE FRONT RUNNERS FOR THE HEISMAN TROPHY. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HE DID DOWN 17-0. HE LED THEM IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND HERE IS DEREK CARR BLOWN OUT BY TAMPA BAY. SECOND AND NINE. OUT OF THE POCKET, HE'S LUCKY THAT WAS NOT PICKED OFF. BARTON COULD NOT SECURE IT. FORCING RATTLER OUT OF THE POCKET. >> THIS IS A MAN TO MAN TEAM BUT THEY WILL PLAY ZONE AND MAKE THE QUARTERBACK MAKE DECISIONS. SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO DIAL UP THE PRESSURE. HE CAUGHT A BREAK THAT TIME THROUGH THE HANDS. >> THIRD AND NINE IN THE POCKET, FIRES, TAKEN IN AT THE 40 SEVEN YARD LINE BY CEDRIC WILSON, TACKLED BY MCMILLAN FOR A FOURTH DOWN. >> IT'S GOING TO BE THAT KIND OF THE GAME. ESPECIALLY WITH RATTLER, LAST WEEK. >> MIGHT BE THAT TYPE OF GAME, TURNS OUT TO BE SOMETHING ELSE. A ROOKIE KICKER BANK THAT ONE INSIDE THE END ZONE. BO NIX COMES BACK OUT. LOOK AT HIS TIMELINE. HE GOES WEST, WINS PLAYER OF THE YEAR, 12TH OVERALL PICK. NO QUARTERBACKS IN 130 EIGHT PICKS UNTIL THEY GOT TO RATTLER. >>. STORY WITH BO NIX, HIS DAD PLAYED QUARTERBACK. AFTER THREE YEARS HE LEFT AND TURNED HIS CAREER AROUND. >> A GAIN OF 74 MARVIN MIMS JR. OUT OF OKLAHOMA. >> THE WORLD WE LIVE IN, THESE COACHES AND GM'S FIND IT REFRESHING WHEN A GUY GETS THROUGH STUFF AND THEN SURVIVES AND HAS BEEN THROUGH TOUGH TIMES. I THINK THAT IS VERY ATTRACTIVE. IT WAS TO SEAN PAYTON. >> SECOND DOWN AND THREE AND THEY HAND THE BALL OFF, JUST LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO PICK UP GOOD YARDAGE. >>3 KIRK: I WATCHED HIM PLAY AT NOTRE DAME. HE IS A POWERFUL BACK. JAVONTE WILLIAMS STILL WORKING HIS WAY BACK FROM THE KNEE A COUPLE YEARS AGO, THEY ARE HOPING ESTIME CAN BE THAT THUMPER IN THE BACKFIELD. AL: THEY WILL BRING IN JALEEL MCLAUGHLIN. SLANTS, COT AND INTO SAINTS TERRITORY GOES VELE, THE ROOKIE OUT OF UTAH. HE LOOKS GOOD, 6'5 H HANDS". KIRK:, A GREAT CATCH RADIUS. WHEN BO NIX'S FEET ARE SET, LOOK HOW GREAT OF A THROWER HE IS. THAT IS WHY THE COACHES ARE SO EXCITED ABOUT HIS POTENTIAL OF WHAT HE CAN BECOME. WORKING THROUGH HIS PROGRESSIONS AND KEEPING THE RHYTHM. WILLIAMS BACK IN AS A RUNNING BACK. PLAY-ACTION. THE PASS WILL BE CAUGHT AT THE 50 YARD LINE. FRANKLIN PICKS UP A COUPLE OF YARDS ON THE PLAY. IT WILL BE SECOND AND 8. KIRK: I AM SURE DENVER LOOKING AT CELL SCOUTING, THEY HAVE ATTACKED THROUGH THE AIR TO THE LEFT BECAUSE COURTLAND SUTTON LINES UP TO THE LEFT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR TARGETS ON A PASSING DIAGRAM, THEY HAVE BEEN THROWING A LOT OF BALLS THE MIDDLE AND OFF TO THE RIGHT. SUTTON WILL EVENTUALLY GET INVOLVED. AL: THEY PUT BURTON IN AT FULLBACK. WILLIAMS BREAKING TACKLES AND HE PICKS UP A FIRST DOWN, GETTING TO THE 35 YARD LINE. KIRK: THEY GO WITH THE BIG FULLBACK, BURTON, NICE JOB LEADING THE WAY WITH THE ISOLATION BLOCK. IT IS GOOD TO SEE JAVONTE WILLIAMS RUN HARD LIKE THAT. AL: THEY GO NO-HUDDLE AND PICK UP THE PACE. GREAT PROTECTION. CAUGHT AT THE 30 YARD LINE, TAKEN DOWN IS JAVONTE WILLIAMS AND THAT WILL MA DOWN AND ABOUT 5. KIRK: ONE GUY YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT TACKLING IS DEMARIO DAVIS. THE REST OF THE DEFENSE MISSED 18 TACKLES AGAINST TAMPA BAY, 33 OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS. JUST A CHECK DOWN AND THEY GET POSITIVE YARDS ON FIRST AND 10. WHEN YOU HAVE A ROOKIE QUARTERBACK, STAY ON SCHEDULE. AL: SECOND AND 4. THE BACK IS MCLAUGHLIN. SMOTHERED. ANFERNEE ORJI COMES IN TO BREAK UP THAT PLAY. IT WILL BE THIRD AND 6. KIRK: FIVE DEFENSIVE LINEMEN IN, SO IT IS HARD TO WORK THE DOUBLE-TEAMS AND GET UP TO THE LINEBACKER. LOOK AT THE DOUBLE-TEAMS, THEY CANNOT QUITE GET UP THERE. IT WAS A GOOD EFFORT BUT IT KEEPS THE LINEBACKER FREE AND HE IS ABLE TO GET DOWNHILL IN A HURRY. AL: THIRD AND 6. SPREAD IT OUT. FIVE WIDE. NIX LOOKS THAT WAY. THROWS. HE STILL HAS IT. NIX ON THE MOVE, BREAKING AWAY THAT TIME FROM CHASE YOUNG, AND OUT OF BOUNDS INSIDE THE 30 YARD LINE. FOURTH AND 3. KIRK: NOT ONLY IS HE FAST, HE IS POWERFUL. GREAT JOB KEEPING THE PLAY ALIVE. ALMOST HAD ENOUGH SPEED TO TURN THE CORNER FOR THE FIRST D BUT AT LEAST HE KEEPS THEM IN FIELD GOAL RANGE. AL: A 46-YARD ATTEMPT FOR WIL LUTZ, WHO WAS PICKED UP LAST YEAR. HE WAS WITH SEAN PAYTON HERE FOR SEVEN YEARS IN NEW ORLEANS. QUARTERBACK, PAYTON AND HIS FIRST YEAR AS HEAD COACH, FACING THE DALLAS COWBOYS, COACHED BY BILL PARCELLS, ONE OF SEAN'S ME NTORS. KIRK: THAT WAS A SPECIAL YEAR IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. AL: ABSOLUTELY. POST-KATRINA. DECIMATED BY KATRINA IN 2005. NOW YOU HAVE PAYTON AND NIX. TOUGH LOVE ALL YEAR LONG. JERMAINE JACKSON FROM THE GOAL UP TO THE 33. THIS TOWN WAS A WRECK. THE SAINTS HAD TO PLAY ALL OF THEIR GAME ON THE ROAD. SAN ANTONIO, BATON ROUGE, SHREVEPORT. THEY COME BACK IN AND PAYTON TAKES THE JOB AND THEY GET AND THAT TURNED EVERYTHING AROUND. KIRK: INCREDIBLE IN HIS FIRST YEAR TO HAVE THAT MOMENT IN THAT BUILDING AFTER EVERYTHING THIS REGION HAD BEEN THROUGH WAS ALMOST LIKE A REBIRTH FOR SO MANY PEOPLE. THEY RALLIED AROUND THIS FOOTBALL TEAM. HE AND DREW BREES ARE SYMBOLIC HAD. AL: THERAPEUTIC FOR THE FANS. ALVIN KAMARA WILL BE TAKEN OUT AFTER A SHORT GAIN. KIRK: HE HAS DOWNPLAYED IT ALL WEEK AND RIGHTFULLY SO. WHEN YOU GET INTO A TEAM SPORT IT IS FOCUSED ON EXECUTION. BUSINESS TRIP AND WINNING A FOOTBALL GAME. AFTER ALL HE WENT THROUGH, IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT FOOTBALL. I THINK THERE IS A LOT TO DO WITH WHAT HE MEANT TO THE CITY. AL: TALKING ABOUT SHOWING UP FIVE HOURS EARLY. HE WENT TO A LUNCHEON HONORING DREW BREES TODAY AT NOON. BREAKING A TACKLE, STILL ON HIS FEET, UP TO THE 40 YARD LINE GOES KENDRE MILLER, WHO THE ACTIVATED. IT WILL BE THIRD AND 2. SEAN, HE LEAVES HERE, HE WAS STILL UNDER CONTRACT, AND THEY HAD TO MAKE A TRADE TO GET HIM TO DENVER. SEAN SPENT A YEAR AT FOX SPORTS, CHARISSA THOMPSON ON HER SHOW. HE MISSED LOOKING AT THE SCOREBOARD. THE CATCH IS MADE BY BUB MEANS, A ROOKIE OUT OF PITTSBURGH. DRAFTED HIM IN THE FIFTH ROUND. KIRK: IMAGINE KLINT KUBIAK TRYING TO PUT THIS GAME PLAN TOGETHER. YOU TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING THEY ARE MISSING, PLAYING A ROOKIE QUARTERBACK, SHAHEED DOWN, OLAVE DOWN, THIRD AND SHORT, A BUNCHED FORMATION AND DENVER DOES NOT PICK UP BUB MEANS, HE WAS ABLE TO CLEAR EASY FOR RATTLER. AL: LOOK OUT! HE GETS HIT WITH THE ARM COMING FORWARD. HAVE NOT HEARD A WHISTLE. MEANWHILE, CODY BARTON COMING IN. THEY WILL RULE THAT A FUMBLE AND A RECOVERY. KWON ALEXANDER, THEY JUST ACTIVATED HIM, IN HIS 10TH EAR IN THE LEAGUE. THEY WILL CONTEND IT IS A FUMBLE. WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AND SEE WHAT REPLAY SHOWS US. KIRK: WATCH HOW BARTON DISGUISES THIS. THIS IS WHAT TAMPA DID LAST WEEK. NOBODY PICKED HIM UP. THE 23RD SACK ON THE YEAR, THEY ARE SECOND IN THE NFL. TERRY MCCAULEY VERIFIES THAT IS A FUMBLE. AL: BARTON IS IN HIS FIRST YEAR IN DENVER. ALEXANDER ON THE RIGHT HAS PLAYED FOR SIX TEAMS NOW. RATTLER WITH THE FUMBLE. BARTON ALMOST HAD A PICK EARLIER. KIRK: HE DID. AL: HE CREATES THE FUMBLE HERE AND DENVER TAKES OVER AT MIDFIELD, AT THEIR 45 YARD LINE. KIRK: HOW DO YOU WIN THE GAME IF YOU ARE DENVER? A ROOKIE QUARTERBACK WHO HAS BEEN GOOD AT TIMES AND AT TIMES HAS BEEN A ROOKIE, YOU LEAN ON YOUR DEFENSE. SEE IF THEY CAN CAPITALIZE ON THIS OPPORTUNITY. AL: HANGS IN THE POCKET, THROWS. CAUGHT AT THE 49 YA LUCAS KRULL. KIRK: WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE TACKLING OR LACK THEREOF FOR NEW ORLEANS. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR NEXGEN STATS. 370 YARDS ALLOWED AFTER MISSED TACKLES. BY FAR THE MOST IN THE NFL. WE HAVE SEEN SOME MOMENTS TONIGHT WHERE JAVONTE WILLIAMS GOT TO THE SECOND LEVEL, BOUNCING OFF OF WOULD BE TACKLERS. THERE HAS BEEN A HUGE EMPHASIS. IN A SHORT WEEK, IT IS TOUGH. THEY SHO TRY TO MOTIVATE THEM. AL: THAT IS 60 YARDS PER GAME WORTH OF MISSED TACKLES. THAT TIME THEY STOP HIM CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN. WE GO TO KAYLEE. KAYLEE: THE SAINTS HAVE OWNED THE TACKLING IS A PROBLEM. DEMARIO DAVIS TOLD ME THERE ARE NO MOTIVATIONAL TACTICS NEEDED AT THIS POINT. EVERYONE HAS A SENSE OF URGENCY. HE BELIEVES SOLVING THE PROBLEM IS MORE MENTAL THAN ANYTHING. THEY CAN EXECUTE BUT IT COMES DOWN TO HAVING A HIGH LEVEL OF FOCUS AND BEING PHYSICAL. AL: DAVIS HAS BEEN CONSISTENT IN HIS CAREER. 200TH GAME FOR HIM. THIRD DOWN AND INCHES AND A QUARTERBACK SNEAK AS NIX KEEPS IT AND TAKES IT TO THE 44-YARD LINE WITH A LITTLE OVER 2 MINUTES TO PLAY I QUARTER. DENVER ON TOP, 3-0. KIRK: YOU HAVE BEEN TACKLING YOUR WHOLE LIFE. IT IS ABOUT COMMUNICATI IT IS LIKE REBOUNDING IN BASKETBALL. WHEN YOU SEE IT CONSISTENTLY BECOMING AN ISSUE -- DENNIS ALLEN TALKED ABOUT ANGLES, LEVERAGE AN TECHNIQUE. A LOT OF TIMES THEY ARE AND THEY HIT BUT THEY DO NOT WRAP UP. I THINK WE HAVE BEEN PRETTY CLEAR. IT HAS BEEN EMPHASIZED. SEE HOW THEY RESPOND TONIGHT. AL: WILLIAMS AND MCLAUGHLIN BOTH IN THE BACKFIELD. 37 YARD LINE, JAVONTE WILLIAMS. KIRK: MIKE MCGLINCHEY BACK IN THE LINEUP. HE HAS BEEN OUT THE LAST FOUR WEEKS AND HE IS NOW BACK AT THE RIGHT TACKLE SPOT. IF YOU ARE A DENVER FAN YOU ARE WATCHING THIS THINKING, "THAT IS MORE LIKE IT." THEY HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL AND TAKE PRESSURE OFF BO NIX. THERE THEY GET POSITIVE YARDS AND GETTING JAVONTE WIL RUNNING DOWNHILL. AL: THEY HAVE ALREADY RUN IT NINE TIMES FOR 52 YARDS ON THE GROUND. SECOND DOWN AND 3. CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN IS WILLIAMS. TAKE A LOOK AT THE STICKS. FIRST DOWN. KIRK: SEAN PAYTON, I LOVED HOW HE SAID I DO NOT HAVE THAT JOKER. WHEN I WAS IN NEW ORLEANS WE HAD A JOKER, REGGIE BUSH OR DARREN SPROLES IN THE BACKFIELD, JEREMY SHOCKEY, JIMMY GRAHAM. THAT MEANS A GUY WHO CAN WIN IN THE PASS GAME, ONE-ON-ONE AGAINST LINEBACKERS. HE HAS HAD TO DO IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS, MIXING UP PERSONNEL GROUPINGS. AL: PASS TO THE OUTSIDE, INCOMPLETE. FLAG IS THROWN. WE WILL HEAR FROM A REFEREE, MR. LAND CLARK, FOR THE FIRST TIME REFEREE: PRIOR TO THE PASS, HOLDING, DEFENSE, NUMBER 29. FIVE YARD PENALTY, AUTOM AL: ADEBO, HE HAS PROBABLY DRAWN MORE FLAGS THAN ANY BACK IN THE LEAGUE. KIRK: WITH MARSHON LATTIMORE ON THE OTHER SIDE IT IS NOT A SHOCK THAT PEOPLE GO AT HIM. WHAT GETS OVERLOOKED BECAUSE HE HAS THREE INTERCEPTIONS AND PEOPLE THINK HE IS HAVING A BIG YEAR BUT A LOT OF PASS INTERFERENCES AND DEFENSE OF HOLDINGS. AL: NIX KEEPS IT, THROWS, CAUGHT OVER THE MIDDLE. TROY FRANKLIN SIGNALS A FIRST WE WILL TAKE A BREAK AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER. WILL GO INTO THE SAINTS HALL OF FAME AT THE HALF AND WE WILL GET HIM UP IN THE BOOTH SOMETIME IN THE THIRD SO, SECOND QUARTER STARTS. WITH A FIRST DOWN AT THE 17-YARD LINE WITH THE DENVER BRONCOS UP, 3-0. TOSS IT HERE, WILLIAMS. A BIT OF A CREASE. THEY HAVE TAKEN OVER THE TIME OF POSSESSION. THEY HAVE HAD THE BALL FOR 11:30, TO A LITTLE LESS THAN 4 FOR THE SAINTS. KIRK: THE CHARGERS KEPT CONVERTING THIRD DOWNS AND HAVE THE BALL FOR 37 MINUTES. THE BIGGEST CHANGE I SEE IS THEY ARE WINNING THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. THEY ARE RUNNING THE FOOTBALL WHICH IS FOOTING BO NIX IN A FAVORABLE POSIT CHECK DOWN PASSES. AL: HANGS IN THE POCKET. PUTS HIS SHOULDER DOWN AND IS ABOUT TO YARDS SHY OF THE FIRST TACKLED BY LATTIMORE. THIRD DOWN AND 2. KIRK: HE HAS BEEN THROWING THESE CHECK DOWNS. THIS TIME HE IS LOOKING TO HIS LEFT, 14, COURTLAND SUTTON, WORKING ACROSS AGAIN ZONE, HE ALMOST THREW IT BUT HE DID THE RIGHT THING BY HOLDING ONTO IT. HE ALWAYS TRUSTS HIS ATHLETIC ABILITY. SETS UP A THIRD AND SHORT. AL: HE HAD 61 RUSHING YARDS LAST SUNDAY, HE ALREADY HAS 31 TONIGHT ON FIVE CARRIES. THIRD AND 1. OFF THE FAKE. A TON OF TIME. ALL DAY, ALL NIGHT. ROLLING. THE COVERAGE IS VERY GOOD AND THE PASS IS SHORT. IT WAS TIPPED. IT WILL BE FOURTH DOWN AND 1. KIRK: HE DID THE HARD PART. THE COVERAGE WAS GOOD. THEY ARE SITTING BACK. THIS TIME THEY BRACKET 84, HUMPHREY. VELE IS TRYING TO WORK OUT ON A DELAYED REACTION. THEY DID EVERYTHING RIGHT AND RECEIVER. AL: GOING FOR IT ON FOURTH AND 1. TRYING TO DRAW THEM OFFSIDE. WELL, YOU CAN LOOK AT IT THIS WAY -- IT WILL BE A VERY LOW- SCORING GAME. YOU THINK MAYBE THEY WILL GO FORWARD ON FOURTH AND 1. THEY TAKE A TIMEOUT HERE. KIRK: I AM WITH YOU. POINTS TONIGHT, IF YOU GET THE CHANCE TO GET INTO FIELD GOAL RANGE, WITH THE WAY DENVER'S DEFENSE WILL PLAY TONIGHT AGAINST RATTLER, YOU TAKE THE THREE POINTS. AL: THAT DOES NOT GO OVER FOR THE OVER, BY THE WAY. KIRK: [LAUGHTER] WE KNEW THAT COMING IN. AL: WIL LUTZ. NO LOVE LOST. 32-YARD ATTEMPT. WRITE DOWN CANAL STREET. THAT WILL MAKE IT DENVER 6, AND NEW ORLEANS DRAFT WITH SIX QUART GOING IN THE FIRST ROUND AND THEN NONE UNTIL THE FIFTH ROUND, WHERE HE WAS PICK NUMBER 150. KIRK: THE PICTURE WITH HIM WITH HIS LEFT THUMB POINTING TO THE NAMEPLATE ON THE BACK, HE IS POINTING TO HIS SHOULDER, THE CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER ENTERING THE NFL. NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE DRAFT BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM IN OKLAHOMA, WHEN CALEB WILLIAMS TOOK OVER. AL: JACKSON TAKES IT A COUPLE OF YARDS DEEP IN THE END Z TAKES IT BACK TO THE 30. KIRK: NOT SHORT ON CONFIDENCE. AL: NO. KIRK: HE IS A GUY THAT DESPITE WHAT HE HAS BEEN THROUGH BELIEVES HE IS DESTINED TO BE STARTER, A FRANCHISE QUARTERBACK. HE IS GETTING WITH DEREK CARR DOWN FOR A FEW GAMES. HE HAS THE PHYSICAL ABILITY. NOT THE TALLEST GUY BUT HE GETS ON THE EDGE, HE IS ATHLETIC AND HAS A BIG ARM. HE NEEDS REPS, HE NEEDS TO LEARN. AL: HIGH SNAP. DROPS IT. IN TROUBLE, RUNS INTO HIS OWN MAN AND THEN LOSES THE BALL. IT IS PICKED UP BY CODY BARTON. TOUCHDOWN. CODY BARTON HAS TAKEN IT INTO THE END ZONE. MEANWHILE, A L GOING ON WITH THE OFFICIALS. KIRK: I THINK DENVER'S D.J. JONES WAS OFFSIDE. IT WILL NEGATE THIS PLAY FOR DENVER. REFEREE: OFFSIDES, DEFENSE, NUMBER 93. FIVE YARD PENALTY, STILL FIRST AL: RIGHT OVER THE CENTER, CONNOR MCGOVERN. A HUGE BREAK FOR THE ROOKIE. INSTEAD OF A TOUCHDOWN -- MEANWHILE, BARTON IS ALL OVER THE PLACE TONIGHT. THE BALL IS OUT TO THE 35-YARD LINE AND A FIRST AND 5. KIRK: HIS OUTSTANDING CENTER IS OUT. THE BACKUP IS OUT. YOU HAVE A GUY, CONNOR MCGOVERN, WHO THEY SIGNED 13 DAYS AGO. AL: AGAIN, THIS TIME THEY WHISTLE IT DEAD. THAT IS BROWNING OFFSIDE. REFEREE: NEUTRAL ZONE INFRACTION, DEFENSE, NUMBER 5. KAYLEE: ACCORDING TO TIGHT FOSTER MOREAU, SPENCER RATTLER THROWS A FASTER BALL AND FROM A DIFFERENT ARM ANGLE THAN DEREK CARR. HE DESCRIBED IT AS A BASEBALL THROW. SOME OF THE SAINTS RECEIVER A HARD TIME ADJUSTING TO THE DEFENSE. THIS TIME THEY TURNED UP THE SPEED ON THE JUGS MACHI BETTER ADJUSTED TO RATTLER. AL: WHATEVER IT TAKES. COMPLEMENT OF RECEIVERS. RATTLER, DEEP DOWN FIELD, THE RECEIVER FALLS DOWN, MASON TIPTON. THE CROWD WANTS A FLAG, THERE IS NONE. RILEY MOSS WITH THE COVERAGE. IT WILL BE SECOND AND 10. KIRK: IT LOOKED LIKE HE LOST HIS BALANCE. DENNIS ALLEN THINKS HE WAS PUSHED BY THE CORNER MAAS. -- THE CORNER MOSS. HE WANTS -- OK. 21 STEPS ON HIS FOOT. AL: SECOND DOWN AND 10. THAT PASS IS CAUGHT FOR A GAIN OF FOUR. JUWAN JOHNSON, A WIDE RECEIVER IN COLLEGE, NOW A TIGHT END. CODY BARTON MAKES THE TACKLE. KIRK: IF YOU DO NOT MIND CLARIFYING FOR PEOPLE, IF YOU HAVE FOOT ENTANGLEMENT AND THE DEFENDER IS NOT PLAYING THE BALL. TERRY: IT IS A FOUL FOR DEFENSIVE PASS INTERFERENCE. IF HE IS PLAYING THE BALL, IT IS NOT A FOUL. AL: OUR EXPERT HAS SPOKEN. AL: THIRD AND 5. RATTLER, PUMP FAKE, THROWS IT OUT OF BOUNDS. THEY PICKED UP A FIRST DOWN ON TWO PENALTIES. ON RATTLER. RATTLER STARTING 4-7 FOR 54 YARDS AND ANOTHER PUNT. KIRK: ONE OF THE MORE UNDERRATED PLAYERS IS ZACH ALLEN. 6'5", 285. YOU CAN SEE HE HAS GOOD QUICKNESS. NOT THE MOST GIFTED GUY. HE SPENT SOME TIME WITH J.J. WATT AND PICKED UP SOME GREAT TECHNIQUE ON HOW TO BECOME A GREAT PASS RUSHER. AL: MATTHEW HAYBALL, FIELDED OF THE 13 YARD LINE AND MIMS GOES NOWHERE. THE COVERAGE IS REALLY GREAT AL: AS OF RIGHT NOW, THE DENVER BRONCOS HAVE HAD THE BALL ALMOST 13 MINUTES. LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES FOR THE SAINTS. THEY START THIS DRIVE FROM THEIR OWN 14-YARD LINE. 6-0. BRONCOS TRYING TO GET ABOVE .500 , SAINTS TRYING TO SNAP A FOUR- GAME LOSING STREAK. ROLLING, LOO 18. KIRK: BO NIX, YOU SEE SOME OF THESE THROWS. HE IS HIS BIGGEST CRITIC. THIS IS AN AREA HE WILL GET MUCH BETTER. HIS MIND IS MOVING FAST AND HIS FEET ARE MOVING FAST AND HE IS MISSING OPEN TARGETS. LOOK HOW MUCH CLEANER IT IS. LOOK AT THE ACCURACY IN THAT THROW RIGHT THERE. THAT IS WHAT HE IS STRIVING THE CONSISTENCY OF THE FOOTWORK BEING BETTER, HIS EYES AND F ALIGNED. AL: SECOND AND 6. THROUGH THE MIDDLE, BIG HOLE, TACKLED FROM BEHIND AT THE 38 YARD LINE GOES JAVONTE WILLIAMS. WE HAVE HAD FOUR DIFFERENT RUSHERS TONIGHT INCLUDING NIX. THAT WAS A GAIN OF 20. KIRK: THE TIGHT END COMES OVER AND HELPS PICK UP. LOOK AT THE CENTER GET TO THE THIS PLAY OPENS UP NICELY. WE HAVE NOT SEEN THIS FROM DENVER MUCH AT ALL THIS YEAR. TAKING A LOT OF THE HEAVY LIFTING OFF BO NIX ANDY'S RECEIVERS AND ALLOWING THEM TO EVENTUALLY GET SOME PLAY ACTION PASS GOING, CHECKING THE BALL DOWN INSTEAD OF HAVING TO FORCE THE BALL DOWNFIELD. 88 YARDS ALREADY ON THE GROUND. AL: THE ROOKIE ESTIME OUT OF NOTRE DAME TAKES THE HANDOFF AND FIGHTS HIS WAY PAST THE 40. SECOND AND 6. KIRK: IF YOU CAN START TO MIX IN ESTIME WITH WILLIAMS, WHO IS OFF TO A REALLY GOOD START, AND THEN THE CHANGE OF PACE BACK IS MCLOUGHLIN. IT IS A NICE TRIO THEY HAVE BACK THERE. REMEMBER, THEY ARE LOOKING FOR PLAYMAKERS. SOMEBODY BESIDE COURTLAND SUTTON AND JOSH REYNOLDS, WHO IS ON THE IR WITH SURGERY ON HIS FINGER. AL: SUTTON HAS NOT BEEN TARGETED. PLAY-ACTION, SCREEN. THERE GOES WILLIAMS, FIRST DOWN NEAR THE 50. POWERS THREW A NICE BLOCK. KIRK: SEAN PAYTON OFFEN WILL ALWAYS BE THINKING ABOUT THE SCREEN GAME. BEN POWERS, NICE JOB OF NOT SELLING IT TOO EARLY. JAVONTE WILLIAMS SHOWING THE JUMP CUT AT HIS SIZE, 220 POUNDS, CUTTING BACK INSIDE. AL: YOU SAW ADEBO COME BACK IN, HE NEEDS A MOMENT. AL: LAST THING THE SAINTS NEED IS ANOTHER KEY INJURY. PAULSON ADEBO, STARTING CORNER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF LATTIMORE. THREE PICKS. HE HAS BEEN WITH THE TEAM SINCE 2021. ALWAYS THE WORST SITE IN T GAME WHEN YOU HAVE TO BRING THE CART OUT. THE SAINTS JUST DECIMATED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BALL. KIRK: ADEBO, PAULSON ADEBO MAKES BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM ON THE CART. ANYTIME WE DO NOT WANT TO REPLAY SOMETHING FOR YOU, YOU KNOW IT IS SERIOUS. HOPE FOR THE BEST FOR PAULSON ADEBO. YOU HAVE KOOL-AID MCKINSTRY COMING INTO REPLACE HIM. IT IS FIRST AND 10 AS PLAY RESUMES FROM THE 50-YARD LINE FOR BO NIX. TO THE OUTSIDE HE GOES. THE OPEN MAN HE FINDS AND DOWN THE SIDELINE GOES FRANKLIN. KNOCKED OUT OF BOUNDS BY MCKINSTRY. THEY GO RIGHT TO JUST CAME IN THE GAME. KIRK: THIS IS A SLOW DEVELOPING LEVELS CONCEPT. THE TWO PLAY SIDE RECEIVERS ARE CLEARING OUT. THE BACKSIDE, FRANKLIN, EVENTUALLY COMES CLEAR AND THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE USED TO SEEING FROM BO NIX FROM HIS COLLEGE DAYS AT OREGON. NICE JOB OF ADJUSTING BY HIS COLLEGE TEAMMATE, FRANKLIN, FOR THE BIG GAIN. AL: BURTON, THE FULLBACK. WILLIAMS, THE RUNNING BACK. TO THE 18 YARD LINE. KAYLEE: YOU SAW THAT RATHER LARGE SPLINT PUT ON PAULSON ADEBO'S RIGHT LEG. IT IS CALLED A VACUUM SPLINT. TYPICALLY WHEN THAT IS USED THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT STABILITY OF THE BONE, NOT JUST A LIGAMENT. AL: OH, BOY. THE INJURY JUST PILING UP. MEANWHILE, YOU HAVE MCKINSTRY, A ROOKIE OUT OF ALABAMA, WHO IS VERY GOOD FRIENDS WITH NIX, WHO WENT TO AUBURN. SECOND DOWN AND 8. THE PASS IS CAUGHT FOR A FIRST FORWARD PROGRESS FOR LIL'JORDAN TACKLED BY TAYLOR. KIRK: IT IS INCREDIBLE, THE BALL IS THROWN RIGHT ON THE MONEY. WHEN HE HAS OPEN RECEIVERS, HE HAS STRUGGLED TONIGHT WITH HIS FOOTWORK AND ACCURACY. BOTH OF THESE DEFENSES IN THE RED ZONE, THEY ARE 1 AND 2. DENVER LEADS THE NFL IN RED ZONE DEFENSE AND THE SAINTS ARE NUMBER 2. YOU WILL HAVE TO EARN IT AL: FIRST AND GOAL, HALFWAY THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER. WIDE OPEN. JAVONTE WILLIAMS WITH A HE GOES IN UNTOUCHED. THEY COMPLETE THAT DRIVE. EIGHT PLAYS, FIVE ON THE GROUND. AN EIGHT YARD TOUCHDOWN HERE. IT TOOK 4:44 AND THEY ARE UP BY TWO SCORES. KIRK: YOU SEE THIS ONE OPEN UP. IT IS NOT ABOUT TACKLING ON THIS ONE, IT IS ABOUT GAP RESPONSIBILITY. AL: DENVER WAS TALKING ABOUT STARTING FASTER. IN THE SIX GAMES PRIOR TO TONIGHT THEY HAD BEEN SHUT OUT IN THE FIRST HALF AND THREE OF THEM. LUTZ FOR THE EXTRA POINT. WITH 7:30 REMAINING IN THE OPENING HALF, THE DENVER BRONCOS , TRYING TO GET TO ABOVE .500, LEADING THE SAINTS, 13-0. KIRK: THE LINEBACKER BLITZ IS PICKED UP BY THE CENTER. THE KICK OUT BLOCK AND THERE IS NO ONE LEFT. THAT IS ABOUT AS EASY AS IT CAN BE ONCE THE CENTER IS ABLE TO PICK UP THE BLITZING LINEBACKER, DEMARIO DAVIS. DENVER RIGHT NOW, OVER 100 YARDS RUSHING. AL: 102 ON THE GROUND AND THE SAINTS WITH NINE. DENNIS ALLEN HAS THAT LOOK AGAIN OF A TEAM THAT STARTED OUT ON FIRE, KNOCKED OFF CAROLINA IN THE OPENER. YOU THINK, NO BIG DEAL. DALLAS. AL:2-0. KLINT KUBIAK, WHAT A HIRE. WE STILL THINK HE IS BUT THE INJURIES ARE STARTING TO STACK AND THEN LOSING DEREK CARR. AL: THEY HAVE THE LEAD AGAINST PHILADELPHIA AND LOST AT THE END. MEANWHILE, IT IS JUGGLED BY JACKSON, WHO WILL RUN IT BACK. TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE COVERAGE UNIT. TO THE 20 YARD LINE HE GOES WITH SKINNER MAKING THE TACKLE. DENNIS ALLEN SPENT 12 YEARS WITH SEAN PAYTON ON THE STAFF TWO DIFFERENT TENURES. IN BETWEEN HE WAS HEAD COACH OF THE OAKLAND RAIDERS FOR TWO FULL SEASONS. DEREK CARR CAME IN AS A ROOKIE AND DENNIS ALLEN WAS STILL TRYING TO GET THIS TEAM TURNED SIX YARD GAIN FOR KAMARA A SUPER ALLEN. THEY WON IT ALL IN 2009 AGAINST THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS. THEY STATED HOUSE WHEN SEAN DECIDED TO STEP AWAY FROM FOOTBALL FOR A YEAR. HIS TEAM NOW WITH A SECOND DOWN AND 4. WILLIAMS GIVES TO THE 28 YARD THIRD DOWN. KIRK: ONE OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT AND HOW YOU WIN WHEN YOU ARE ON THE ROAD, YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS QUARTERBACK HAVE TO WORK A LONG FIELD. TONIGHT THEY HAVE STARTED DEEP IN THEIR OWN FIELD POSITION. A LOT OF TIMES AROUND THEIR OWN 20. VANCE JOSEPH, WHO BY THE WAY WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL IN THIS AREA, HE IS FIRED UP TO BE BACK HOME AND BRING IN ONE OF THE NFL'S TOP THEY ARE PLAYING VERY WELL TONIGHT AND VERY SOUND ALL YEAR. AL: HERE IS A THIRD AND 3. PRESSURE. GETTING AWAY, KEEPING HIS EYES DOWNFIELD. CAN HE GET THE FIRST DOWN? HE IS BUMPED OUT SHORT OF IT BY BARTON, WHO IS HAVING A HECKUVA NIGHT. KIRK: THEY ARE PLAYING ZON THEIR EYES ARE ON THE WHEN BO NIX LOOKS TO RUN, HE IS TAKE OFF. RATTLER, HE HAS SOME ATHLETIC ABILITY, NO WATCHES LEFT-HAND. HE IS TRYING TO THROW. HE WAS NOT THINKING ABOUT GETTING THE FIRST DOWN. HE DID NOT HAVE ANOTHER RECEIVER OTHER THAN THE ONE THAT WAS DEEP. 55, CODY FIELD. AL: FOURTH AND INCHES, SAINTS WILL TAKE A TIMEOUT. IF YOU ARE NEW ORLEANS, HAVING TROUBLE ON OFFENSE WITH A ROOKIE -- THE CROWD WANTS YOU TO GO FOR IT BUT GOOD LUCK IF YOU DO NOT MAKE IT HERE. WE ARE APPROACHING THE MARK OF THE SEASON. KIRK: YEAH. AL: A LOT OF THINGS STAND OUT -- NAME ONE. KIRK: HOW ABOUT THE MOVES WITH THE JETS? IT HAS BEEN A SOAP OPERA WITH EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON. THE LATEST, DAVANTE ADAMS COMING OVER FROM LAS VEGAS. YOU KNEW HE WOULD GET MOVED, A LOT OF PEOPLE ASSUME HE WOULD END UP WITH AARON. THEY LOSE A TOUGH GAME AND T BREAK THE NEWS THAT DAVANTE ADAMS IS COMING. WITH THE AMARI COOPER COMING OVER TO HELP THEM ON THE PERIMETER? AL: THE JETS WILL BE IN PITTSBURGH ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND THEN WE GET THEM AT HOME AGAINST HOUSTON ON HALLOWEEN NIGHT. THEY WILL LINE UP TO GO FOR IT AND THEY DO. AND IT IS FLOATED AND CAUGHT AND THEY GET A BREAK BY GETTING THE FIRST DOWN AS JUWAN JOHNSON IS THAT IS ABOUT AS SLOW DEVELOPING PLAY AND A GET THE FIRST DOWN. A GUTSY CALL BY KLINT KUBIAK. HE FLOATS THAT OVER THE TOP OF ZACH ALLEN AND LUCKILY THE DEFENSE IS FOOLED ON THE FOURTH AND SHORT. NOBODY HOME. ABLE TO SECURE THAT AND PICK UP THAT IS A GUY -- JUWAN JOHNSON -- WHO THEY THINK PLAYS. AL: ROLLING, THROWING, CAUGHT ALONG THE SIDELINE. ALVIN KAMARA MAKES THE GRAB. KAMARA IN HIS EIGHTH SEASON, LONGEST TENURE WITH ONE TEAM AMONG RUNNING BACKS. KIRK: THAT IS ONLY THE FOURTH TOUCH HE WOULD HAVE. I THOUGHT COMING INTO TONIGHT, IF THEY WERE GOING TO MOVE THE BALL, 41, WHETHER CATCHING THE BALL OR RUNNING, THEY HAVE TO GET HIM ON TRACK. KLINT KUBIAK FIGURING OUT DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET THE RHYTHM GOING WITH ALL OF HIS INJURIES AND HIS ROOKIE QUARTERBACK. TOSS HERE. RUNNING INTO A BRICK WALL AT THE 50-YARD LINE IS KAMARA. THAT TIME HE IS TAKEN JORDAN JACKSON. YOU LOOK AT KLINT KUBIAK, YOU CANNOT HELP BUT THINK WAS THE COACH OF THE DENVER BRONCOS WHEN THEY WON SUPER BOWL 50. STEPPED AWAY. KIRK: HIS SON HAS A HUGE FUTURE IN THIS BUSINESS. HE WAS AT SAN FRANCISCO LAST YEAR WITH KYLE SHANAHAN AS THE PASSING GAME COORDINATOR, NOW GETS A SHOT IN NEW ORLEANS. AL: THIRD AND 2. AVOIDING THE SACK, GETTING AWAY, DEEP INTO DENVER TERRITORY AND RATTLER IS OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 20-YARD LINE. BROWNING ALMOST HAD HIM, COULD NOT SECURE HIM AND OFF HE G FOR 28. KIRK: THEY BRING EVERYONE UP, PLAY MAN-TO-MAN COVERAGE, IT A GREAT JOB OF FEELING THIS BY RATTLER AND THEN CLIMBING THE ONCE HE GOT AWAY FROM THE INITIAL SURGE, THERE IS LEFT BECAUSE OF THE MAN-TO-MAN COVERAGE. THIS TIME HE IS LOOKING TO RUN ONCE HE GETS OUT OF THERE. HE GETS VALUABLE YARDS. DEREK CARR LIKES TO SEE THAT. REFEREE: TIMEOUT, DENVER. AL: DENVER TAKES A TIMEOUT WITH 3:09. PUTTING TWO MORE SECONDS BACK ON THE CLOCK. LOOKING AT OUR SCHEDULE DOWN THE LINE, WE TALKED ABOUT THE JETS GAME ON HALLOWEEN AGAINST HOUSTON. AND THEN A BUSY NOVEMBER FOR US. WE WILL GET THE RAVENS AND THE BENGALS. WASHINGTON AND PHILLY. ON BLACK FRIDAY, THE DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING, THE RAIDERS GO TO KANSAS CITY. OUR ONE KANSAS CITY GAME THIS YEAR WILL BE ON FRIDAY WITH A 3:00 EASTERN TIME KICKOFF. KIRK: KEEP EATING. AL: KEEP EATING LEFTOVERS ON FRIDAY. AFTER THE TIMEOUT, 3:09. WILLIAMS IS THE RUNNING BACK. FAKE IT TO HIM, GIVEN TO KAMARA. AROUND THE CORNER HE GOES. COMING UP IS JA'QUAN MCMILLIAN TO MAKE THE TACKLE. A LOSS OF SEVEN. KIRK: WITHOUT SURTAIN, LEVI WALLACE HAS HAD TO STEP UP. THESE DEFENDERS ARE PLAYING WITH A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE THIS YEAR IN THIS SCHEME WITH VANCE JOSEPH. THIS IS A TEAM THAT PLAYS A TON OF MAN-TO-MAN WHEN SURTAIN IS OUT THERE. VANCE JOSEPH D THAT. AL: SECOND AND 17. THAT IS MASON TIPTON MAKING THE GRAB, RILEY MOSS MAKING THE TACKLE. THIRD AND 11 FOR NEW ORLEANS. KIRK: YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE QUARTERBACK AND YOU CAN DISGUISE MORE AND MAKE HIM GET A PRE-SNAP LOOK AND THEN GO TO ANOTHER LOOK TO CREATE HESITATION AND CONFUSION. REFEREE: PLEASE RESET THE CLOCK TO 2:27. AL: DENVER WILL TAKE ANOTHER TIMEOUT ON DEFENSE. 2:27. GIVES US A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE STANDINGS RIGHT NOW. IN THE TWO DIVISIONS AND PLAY. THE AFC WEST, THE CHIEFS ARE UNBEATEN. IN THE SOUTH YOU HAVE THE FALCONS AND THE BUCS BOTH 4-2 WITH THE SAINTS TRYING TO HANG IN AT 2-4. KIRK: THE RACE ON THE LEFT, FOR DENVER IT IS ABOUT TRUSTING THIS A TOP-5 DEFENSE IN THE ENTIRE LEAGUE. THERE ARE TIMES BO NIX AND THIS OFFENSE WILL KEEP G AND BETTER. AL: THIRD AND 11. PRESSURE, CAUGHT. TRYING TO BREAK AWAY AND GETS A COUPLE MORE YARDS TO THE 17-YARD LINE BUT WELL SHY OF THE FIRST THAT IS GOING TO TAKE US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TO THE 2-MINUTE WARNING. STATE FARM HALFTIME COMING YOU HAVE THE WHOLE GANG, PAINTING THE TOWN RED AS THEY DO EVERY WEEK. I KNOW. THERE THEY COME. SHERMAN. [LAUGHTER] EVERYBODY WORKING HARD. ON 28 MINUTES OF SLEEP. ALL RIGHT, 33. STATE FARM HALFTIME SHOW COMING YOUR WAY NEXT. DREW BREES IS GOING TO BE INTO THE HALL OF FAME. MEANWHILE, FOURTH DOWN AND 5. FOR A MOMENT, THEY LEFT THE OFFENSE OUT THERE. BLAKE GRUPE, WHO WAS SO GOOD LAST YEAR, THEY TREATED LET'S -- TRADED UT TRADED ULUTZ, SENT HIM TO DENVER THIS WILL BE AT 35 YARD ATTEMPT. SNAP GOOD, HOLD GOOD. ON THE BOARD. 13-3. COUNTS, IT WILL BE QUITE VALUABLE, DON'T YOU THINK? DOES NOT LOOK LIKE X FOUR Z -- X OR Z. I'M TRYING TO THINK OF WHAT A GUYS NAME WOULD BE -- YOU WOULD JUST HAVE TO HAVE A FIRST NAME. THREE LETTERS IN THE SECOND. KIRK: I CANNOT THINK OF ANYTHING. AL: THIS IS WHAT WE DO IN THESE THINGS OUT. KIRK: THERE IS DAVIS WEBB, THE QUARTERBACK COACH, TALKING TO THEM BEFORE THE FIELD. THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE IN THAT ROOM, AND ALREADY, A QUARTERBACK COACH FOR THE NFL. I'M SURE HE HAS GOT A BRIGHT FUTURE IN THIS BUSINESS. BY THE WAY, FIRST TIME THE BRONCOS HAVE HAD 100 YARDS PASSING SINCE 2020, 4 YEARS AGO. AL: RUNNING BACK FROM NIMS. INTO THE END ZONE. BRING SET BACK OUT TO THE 28 YARD LINE WITH 152. ONE TIMEOUT REMAINING FOR KIRK: IT HAS BEEN PRODUCTIVE FIRST HALF FOR BO NIX AND HIS OFFENSE, 13-3. LET'S SEE WHAT SEAN P DECIDES TO DO WITH HIS YOUNG SEE WHAT KIND OF COMPETENCY HAS WITH HIM. IF HE IS SECURE WITH A 10 POINT LEAD, OR IF YOU TRUST THEM TO KEEP ATTACKING HERE WITH THAT ONE TIMEOUT. AL: FROM THE 28. THEY BEGIN THIS DRIVE. NIX, 102 YARDS THROUGH THE AIR. 35 ON THE GROUND, ALSO. SWINGS WENT OUT HERE. MISSED TACKLE. SIX OR SO FOR JAVONTE WILLIAMS. KIRK: PEOPLE FORGET WILLIAMS WHEN HE WAS COMING OUT OF NORTH CAROLINA, WHAT KIND OF FUTURE A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT HE COULD HAVE IN THE NFL AND HAD TO REALLY BAD INJURY, CAM FROM IT LAST YEAR AND WAS NOT QUITE THE SAME. THIS IS THE BEST HE HAS LOOKED SINCE THE INJURY, AS FAR AS THE HALF IS CONCERNED. AL: RUNNING DOWN TO 1.5 AND ON SECOND AND TWO AND AFTER THE TRAFFIC INTO THE 46 YARD LINE, AND LAUNCHED IT, SO THAT WILL MAKE IT THIRD DOWN AND 2. COULD NOT HOLD ON. GOOD-LOOKING ROOKIE OUT OF UTAH. TALKED ABOUT HIM, LOOKING FOR HIS FIRST CAREER. HE HAD EIGHT RECEPTIONS IN THE OPENER. CAME BACK WITH FOUR MORE LA THIRD AND 2. GOOD P OPEN. FIRST DOWN, RIGHT TO MIDFIELD GOES LUCAS KROLL, THE TIGHT END. CONSERVING THAT LAST TIMEOUT. A LITTLE OVER ONE MINUTE REMAINING IN THE HALF. KIRK: GREAT COMMUNICATION BY THE OFFENSIVE LINE AND GIVE BO NIX ENOUGH TIME ON THAT THIRD DOWN. AL: STAYS IN THE POCKET BUT HAS TO THROW IT AWAY. THAT WILL BE A FLAG. KIRK: JAVONTE WILLIAMS WAS RIGHT THERE, RIGHT AT HIS FEET. HE GOT LOST IN THE SHUFFLE WITH ALL THOSE LINEMEN, BUT HE WAS RIGHT THERE. AL: ANNOUNCED IN THE RECEIVER IN THE AREA? NO GROUNDING. KIRK: HE THROWS IT RIGHT AT HIS FEET. FROM THE 49. KIRK: THIS IS USUALLY WHERE THEY LIKE TO GET SUTTON INVOLVED. RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM. AL: THEY HAVE NOT EVEN TARGETED HIM TONIGHT. PRESSURE, THROWING, ALMOST PICKED OVER THE 34 YARD LINE. RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF TIME MATTHEW, NO STRANGER TO INTERCEPTIONS -- MATTHEW, NO STRANGER TO INTERCEPTIONS. EASY. KIRK: BO NIX, IT IS LIKE THROUGH BETWEEN TWO RECEIVERS, THE CROSSING, AND DOWNFIELD, RIGHT IN BETWEEN HIM. ALMOST A FAIR CATCH FOR MATTHEW. THE LAST GUY ON THE FIELD THAT YOU TAKE WOULD DROP A SHORT INTERCEPTION. AL: ABSOLUTELY, ALMOST TOO EASY. THIRD AND 10. NI, BUYING TIME -- NIX, BUYING TIME. A BROKEN TACKLE, AND MIMS IS ABLE TO GET THAT EXTRA YARDAGE. I THINK THE FIRST DOWN. KIRK: WE TALKED ABOUT THAT LAST PASS WHEN HE SHOWED CONFIDENCE IN HIS YOUNG QUARTERBACK JUST BECAUSE THE POTENTIAL OF A PASS THAT COULD COST HIM POINTS. YET, HE COMES RIGHT BACK WITH THE NEXT CALL AFTER THAT POOR DECISION BY BO NIX, BECOMES RIGHT BACK TO SHOW CONFIDENCE AND TO LOOK DOWNFIELD. HE CHECKS IT DOWN, AND BREAKS UP THE TACKLE AND PICKS UP THAT AL: BRONCOS RUNNING THEIR 38TH PLAY. ONLY 21. PRESSURE COMING. NIX THROWS. A LITTLE BIT SHORT. MARVIN MIMS IS THERE. KIRK: THAT WAS A GREAT THROUGH -- THROW, CONSIDERING THE HE HAD TO GET THE BALL OUT WELL BEFORE WAS THINKING OF COMING BACK TO THE FOOT -- BEFORE MIMS WAS THINKING OF COMING BACK TO THE FOOTBALL. SO THAT BALL IS EASILY CATCHABLE. BUT THE SAINTS HAVE DIALED UP THE PRESSURE ON THIS DRIVE, AND THAT TIME HE IS FORCED TO THROW IT A LITTLE BIT ENOUGH ON HIM. AL: SECOND AND 10. NIX, GOING TO RUN IT. NIX HAS CARRIED THE BALL SEVEN IT IS GREAT TO THEY TAKE A TIMEOUT TERRY HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT YOUR QUARTERBACK RUNNING -- HOW -- THEY TAKE A TIMEOUT. HOW MUCH QUARTERBACK RUNNING? KIRK: BECAUSE OF THE SCREEN, BY MIMS, IT WAS PICKED UP BY CARL GRANDERSON, SO HE DID THE SMART THING. WATCH GRANDERSON SNIFF THIS OUT. WAIT A MINUTE, SOMETHING IS GOING ON. HE IS RIGHT THERE WITH THE RECEIVER, TAKES THEM AWAY. BO NIX IS FORCED WITH MEN DOWNFIELD, FORCED TO RUN IT AND GET SOMETHING POSITIVE OUT OF IT AND USE THE LAST TIMEOUT. AL: BALL AT THE 37, SO IF YOU DO NOT GAIN ANOTHER YARD, YOU COULD BE LOOKING AT A 55 YARD FIELD GOAL. THE SAINTS WILL GET THE BALL WHEN WE START THE SECOND HALF. FIVE RUSHING YARDS, 59 FOR WILLIAMS, 38 FOR NIX. KIRK: THIRD DOWN HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE FOR THEM THIS YEAR. BUT TONIGHT THEY HAVE BEEN PRETTY GOOD. AL: THEY ARE THREE OUT OF SIX. KIRK: THEY MOVE SUTTON FROM THE LEFT ALL THE WAY TO THE RIGHT AGAINST THE ROOKIE. AL: NUMBER 14. 37 -- THIRD AND SEVEN. NIX WILL TAKE OFF AGAIN AND SCOOTS OUT OF BOUNDS. A LITTLE BIT SHY. THEY ARE GOING TO SEND IN THE FIELD GOAL UNIT NOW WITH 21 SECONDS AND NO TIMEOUTS REMAINING. KIRK: SO HE GETS A YARDS ON THE SCRAMBLE. GETS OUT OF BOUNDS. GOING TO HAVE TO HURRY IT UP HERE TO TAKE THE FIELD GOAL. AT LEAST TO GET SOME INTO FIELD GOAL RANGE. -- AT LEAST TO GET SOME AL: THIS HAS BECOME ALMOST A CHIP SHOT THESE DAYS. 50, 59, HITTING THREE OF THEIR ATTEMPTS. HERE IS ANOTHER ONE. 52 YARD FIELD GOAL IS GOOD. HE HAS THREE FIELD GOALS AL: SO, THE ROOKIE FROM OREGON, 41 GROUND YARDS, THEY HAVE HAD THE BALL ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF THE FIRST HALF. CONTROLLING THE PACE, THE TEMPO. TOUCHBACK. KIRK: THIS DEFENSE FROM DENVER HAS LIVED UP TO THE BILLING. TOP FIVE IN A LOT OF CATEGORIES. A NO-NAME DEFENSE. WE PROBABLY DON'T KNOW A LOT OF THE PLAYERS, BUT THEY PLAY WELL AS A UNIT, UNDERSTANDING THE PURPOSE, GOING AGAINST THIS ROOKIE QUARTERBACK, RELYING ON THE FRONT TO GET HOME AND TO GET THAT PRESSURE WITHOUT HAVING THE BLITZ, EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE A BLITZ TEAM, SECOND AND THE ENTIRE NFL AS FAR AS BLITZ AND PRESSURE, BUT THEY HAVE RELIED ON THE FRONT AND ALLOW THAT SECOND AND THIRD TO KEEP THEIR EYES ON THE QUARTERBACK. AL: OVER THE MIDDLE. THAT GOES NOWHERE. TACKLED BY MCMILLAN. WOULD LIKE TO REEMPHASIZE THE MAC. TAKE ABOUT 11 SECONDS HERE. YOU ARE TRYING T KIRK: MAYBE TRY TO GET API. THINK ABOUT IF YOU ARE SPENCER RATTLER. YOU DECIDED TO STEP IN FOR DEREK CARR AND GET AN OPPORTUNITY AND IN YOUR FIRST CAREER START TO GO UP AGAINST SCOTT BOWLES AND THEY GET CREATIVE WITH THEIR BLITZ PACKAGE. DREW BREES WILL BE HONORED HERE AT HALFTIME. AND THEN THE SECOND GAME, HE IS GOING UP AGAINST JOSEPH AND HIS THAT IS HIS INTRODUC NFL. AL: TWO OF THE BEST. DREW WILL JOIN US FOR A SEGMENT OR TWO IN THE BOOTH IN THE THIRD MEANWHILE, UNDER PRESSURE, AND THAT IS THE WAY THIS HALF IS GOING TO END, IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, BUT THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER TIMEOUT? I GUESS. FOR WHAT PRACTICAL PURPOSE? TELL ME. EVEN YOU ARE STUMPED. AND TO DO THAT IS HARD. KIRK: YOU ARE EXCITED OR WHAT GOING ON BEHIND THIS WALL RIGHT HERE AT HALFTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY? AL: IT DEPENDS I HAVE TO SEE. KIRK: WHAT IS ON THE MENU. AL: WHAT ARE WE HAVING TONIGHT? CAJUN OR CREOLE? KIRK: A GREAT TOWNKIRK: -- KIRK: A GREAT TOWN FOR FOOD. AL: SURE. FUMBLE, PUNT FIELD GOAL FOR THE YOU WILL TAKE A TIMEOUT? THAT IS THE ONLY ONE I HAVE EVER SEEN, AND A KNEEL DOWN FOLLOWS. KIRK: AND NOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET BOOED OFF. AL: I KNOW, WHATEVER. 16-3 IS THE HALFTIME SCORE. IN THE LAST 60 MINUTES OF PLAY, THIE SAINTS HAVE SCORED THREE POINTS. BRONCOS ON TOP BY 13. KAYLEE: FOUR SCORING TOUCHDOWN, HOW DO YOU ASSESS BO NIX? >> WE ARE RUNNING IT WELL, BO IS MOVING WELL. I HATE SETTLING FOR FIELD GOALS. THE SECOND HALF, THAT'S THE FIRST THING ABOUT OFFENSIVELY. KAYLEE: NO TARGETS FOR COURTLAND SUTTON. >> I THINK YOU'RE GETTING A LOT MORE ZONE. THEY ARE TRYING TO KEEP THEIR EYES ON THE Q. WHEN YOU ARE IN M SOMETIMESAN, HE CAN COVER MORE, SO A LOT MORE ZONE COVERAGE AND WE HAVE SEEN. AL: HALFTIME COMING UP, THE STATE FARMQUARTERBACK COMPARISON IS IMPRESSIVE. RATTLER IS STILL TIME TO GET SOMETHING GOING. KIRK: WHEN YOU HAVE ROOKIE QUARTERBACKS, THE GAME STILL MOVING REAL FAST FOR THESE GUYS. ESPECIALLY IN RATTLER'S CASE, WHERE HE WAS INACTIVE THE FIRST FIVE WEEKS OF THE SEASON, PLAYED LAST WEEK AND NOW HERE HE IS ON A SHORT WEEK WITH A LOT OF INJURIES ON HIS OFFENSIVE LINE, TRYING TO FIGURE THINGS OUT. THAT IS TOUGH TO DO. AL: SAINTS WILL TAKE IT TO THE 30 YARD LINE MOMENTS AGO. KAYLEE: TACKLING WAS A BIG POINT OF EMPHASIS THIS WEEK. HOW DO YOU FEEL YOUR DEFENSE DID? >> WE WERE BETTER TACKLING, BUT WE STILL GOT A LOT OF THINGS TO FIX AND CORRECT. IT WAS UNFORTUNATE WE GAVE UP THE THREE POINTS ON THE TWO-MINUTE DRIVE, BUT THE BIGGEST THING HAS BEEN THE THE QUARTERBACK HAS BEEN ABLE TO RUN AND SCRAMBLE. KAYLEE: WHAT WAS YOUR MESSAGE TO HALF? >> GO OUT, KEEP PLAYING. HE HAS DONE GOOD THINGS. HIM, TOO. KAYLEE: THANK YOU. AL: THANK YOU. MEANWHILE, IT IS DROPPED AREA HAVE TO MAKE SOME PLAYS. CEDRIC WILSON DROPPING THE SECOND DOWN. KIRK: SPENCER RATTLER IS MAKING HIS SECOND CAREER START, WORTH MENTIONING. YOU HAVE YOUR TWO BEST RECEIVERS OUT OF THE LINEUP. YOUR STARTING CENTER, WHO IS OUTSTANDING, MCCOY, IS ON THE NJOKU -- I.R.. THE RIGHT AND LEFT GUARDS ARE HILL IS OUT, AND YOU ARE TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER SOME CONTINUITY. AGAINST ONE OF THE BETTER DEFENSES IN THE LEAGUE. AL: HE SWINGS IT OUT. HE SAW NUMBER THREE, JAKE HAENER, WHO WOULD BE THE BACKUP QUARTERBACK RIGHT NOW. THERE HE IS. WHAT DO YOU DO? DO YOU PUT HIM IN AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME? HELLO ROOKIE, YOU HAVE RATTLER DOING HIS THING. OF COURSE, DEREK CARR. KIRK: THERE IS HILL ON THE LEFT. I THINK WHAT YOU DO IS YOU HAVE GOT TO STICK WITH THIS GUY BECAUSE HE IS MOVING. HE IS ATHLETIC ENOUGH, MUCH MORE THAN JAKE HAENER, TO GET AWAY FROM THIS PRESSURE LINE IS CREATING. AL: MORE PRESSURE, AND HE FIRES THIS ONE, DROPPED RIGHT THERE. COVERAGE IS GOOD, BUT JOHNSON HAD TO CATCH THE THROUGH THERE, AND IT IS FOURTH DOWN AND 7. KIRK: MATHIS IS BACK. HE HAD AN ANKLE T OUT OF THE LINEUP AND THAT IS WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE. THEY ARE LOOKING FOR PLAYMAKERS WITH THE TOP TWO RECEIVERS DOWN, HE MAY GET A LITTLE COLD, BUT YOU LOOK TO SEE JOHNSON WORK BACK TO THE BALL AND MAKE THAT CATCH, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE AL: THEY START THE SECOND HALF WITH A 39 SECOND THREE AND OUT. AND HEY WALL'S KICK FIELDED TO THE TWO YARD LINE. MIMS. DECENT RUN BACK. OUT TO THE 34. KIRK: THE FIRST HALF, THE MOST POSITIVE THING FOR BO NIX AND DENVER IS THE FACT THAT THEY GOT A PUSH. LOOK AT THESE HOLES. THIS IS NOT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AT ALL FROM DENVER. IT IS ALLOWING JAVONTE WILLIAMS, AND HE HAS BEEN THERE TO GET THEM TO THE SECOND A LEVEL. LOOK AT THE OFFENSIVE LINE. THEY ARE DOING A HECKUVA JOB, OPENING UP HOLES, NOT MAKING BO NIX, LIKE LAST WEEK, FEELING LIKE THEY COULD NOT RUN THE BALL AS WELL. THEY PUT A LOT ON BO NIX THE PAST GAME BUT NOT TONIGHT. AT LEAST THE FIRST HALF. AL: ON THE GROUND HERE. ANOTHER GOOD RUN BY WILLIAMS. KIRK: BRYAN BRESEE, HE IS IN THE YOU TALK ABOUT DENVER, WHA GOOD JOB THEY ARE DOING WITH THEIR OFFENSIVE LINE, BUT CRESE -- BRESEE IS RIGHT THERE. INSTEAD, IT IS A MISSED TACKLE. AND JOVAN TAYLOR WILLIAMS, TOUGH RUNNING. THEY HAVE BEEN OPENING HOLES ON HOW HE RUNS ON THIS ONE, IT WAS THE YOU GOT PENETRATION. HE WAS ABLE TO SHAKE IT. AL: THE ROOKIE IS THE RUNNING FIRST DOWN PLAY, GIVEN TO HIM, AND A NICE RUN TO THE 46 YARD LINE, CHEWING HIM UP ON THE GROUND HERE, THAT IS 121 RUSHING YARDS. KIRK: NOT TO GET INTO THE MINUTIA AS FAR AS FOUR-POINT -- 47 YARDS, BUT THEY ARE NEAR THE BOTTOM COMING INTO THE NIGHT ON PENETRATION AND ALLOWING DEFENSES TO BE ABLE TO SLOW THE RUNNING BACKS DOWN BEFORE THEY GET STARTED. TONIGHT, THEY HAVE DONE A MUCH BETTER JOB OF CREATING SOME HOLES. AL: BY THE WAY, THAT IS MINUT 2.0. HERE'S MCLAUGHLIN. LOOK AT THIS. MCLAUGHLIN, AND THEY FINALLY STOPPED, THE 25 YARD LINE. MATTHEW -- TYRANN MATHIEU THE TOUCHDOWN. GREAT OPENING DRIVE IN PROGRE FOR THE BRONCOS. KIRK: A LITTLE EYE CANDY. THIS IS JUST A TOSS THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO GET YOUR MORE TALENTED PLAYMAKER IN SPACE OUT THERE AGAIN. A NICE PICKUP FOR ANDERSON AND SOME ROOM TO RUN FOR ANOTHER DENVER RUNNING BACK. AND SEAN PAYTON HAS GOT TO BE SO HAPPY WITH WHAT HE THIS OFFENSIVE LINE NOW. AL: GREAT OPENING SECOND HALF. DRIVE FOR THE BRONCOS FROM THE 25 YARD LINE. TO THE OUTSIDE. BACK INSIDE. FINALLY, THEY CORRALLED HIM. JAVONTE WILLIAMS. SECOND DOWN, SECOND AND 9. KIRK: THEY COULD RUN THE BALL DOWN THE ENTIRE FIELD. I'M SURE BO NIX IS GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A PLAY HERE. THE SAINTS. AL: 20TH IN THE LEAGUE AGAINST THE RUN. THEY HAVE GIVEN UP MORE THAN AVERAGE, 105TH AND 23 CARRIES, OVER FIVE YARDS PER. SECOND AND 9. COMING, HANGS IN THERE, AND THEY CAUGHT IT AT THE 20 YARD LINE, TROY FRANKLIN, MAKING IT THIRD DOWN AND 5. SO THE BRONCOS, OF COURSE, THEY HAD THE SITUATION OVER TWO YEARS, AND THEN THEY KNEW THEY HAD TO GO INTO THE DRAFT, COULD HAVE TREATED UP, BUT THEY WAITED , AND THEY STILL HAD A GUY THEY WANTED AS THE NUMBER 12 PICK. KIRK: AND I THINK HE IS A GUY EVERYBODY WANTED, BUT I THINK BO NIX FITS YOU WOULD LIKE TO GROW THE OFFENSE. AL: THIRD DOWN AND 5. AND INTO THE CORNER OF THE END ZONE, AND INCOMPLETE. COVERAGE WAS VERY GOODBYE TAYLOR. -- GOOD BY TAYLOR. THEY BECOME THE FIELD GOAL GROUP WATCH HIM WORK THROUGH TRAFFIC IN THIS FORMATION. HE HAS GOT TO BE ABLE TO WORK AROUND ONE OF HIS OWN PLAYERS. HE DOES A GOO HIS EYES TURNED BACK TO THE FOOTBALL. ONCE HE FELT HUMPHREY LOOK BACK FOR THE BALL, HE DID A GOOD JOB OF GETTING HIS OWN EYES TURNED BACK, WAS ABLE TO LOCATE AND KNOCK IT AWAY. AL: TEXTBOOK, 38 YARD ATTEMPT. AND HE IS NOW FOUR FOR FOUR. A. 'OF TIME -- WHAT A PERIOD OF TIME, SEAN PAYTON AND DREW BREES HOOKING UP TOGETHER. DREW IS GOING TO JOIN US INTO THE BOOTH AFTER HE WAS INDUCTED INTO THE SAINT HALL OF FAME -- SAINT HALL OF FAME. THIS DRIVE WILL START FROM 30 YARD LINE. HERE HE IS. I'M READING ABOUT YOU AND THE PAPER TODAY. YOU ARE OPENING UP A PICKLEBAL FACILITY. HOW IS RETIREMENT TREATING YOU? DREW: LIFE AFTER FOOTBALL. IF YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYMORE, YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THE PADDLE. IT IS GOOD. A LOT OF FAMILY TIME, COACHING HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL, AND POPP WARNER, SHOUT OUT TO THE EAGLES. WE ARE DOWN THE STRETCHER IN THE PLAYOFFS. THAT IS FILLING A LOT OF TIME. AL: YOUR TEAM WILL WHITWORTH'S TEAM AT SOME TIME. DREW: I HOPE SO. AL: THIS DRIVE BEGINNING FROM THE 30 YARD LINE, STARTING WITH MILLER. I THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU SIGN HERE , YOU HAVE SAN DIEGO, THE SURGERY, AND THEN I THINK MIAMI TURNED YOU DOWN BECAUSE OF A SHOULDER. NEW ORLEANS, THE CITY WAS DECIMATED. YOU HAVE A NEW COACH, NOT EVEN KNOWING IF YOU COULD PLAY IN THE BUILDING. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING THAT POINT? DREW: SEAN PAYTON GOT LOST DURING OUR VISIT, AND HE SHOWED US THINGS HE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO, WHICH WAS THE DEVASTATION. AND IT HAD THE REVERSE EFFECT. IT MADE ME REALIZE THIS WAS MORE THAN FOOTBALL. AL: THERE IS A GRAB, BUT A TACKLE THERE. KIRK: I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT WHEN YOU COME BACK, AND I KNOW YOU COME BACK WITH YOUR FAMILY, IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT FOOTBALL. WHAT DOES THE REGION MEAN TO YOU BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS YOU HAD ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD AND WHAT IT MEANT TO THE CITY IT REVITALIZED IT? DREW: THIS REGION, COMMUNITY, FAN BASE, IT SHAPED US ALL. ALL THE GUYS PART OF THE JOURNEY DURING THE SEAN PAYTON ERA FROM 2006 UNTIL WE WERE TIRED, WE EXPERIENCED INCREDIBLE THINGS BUT WE HAD BETTER PLAYERS AS A RESULT OF BEING A PART OF THIS. AL: FLAG HERE ON WHAT WAS A THIRD DOWN AND 11. WHAT DO YOU THINK SO FAR OF YOUR ROOKIE QUARTERBACK? DREW: HE IS AN EXCITING PLAYER AND CAN DO A LOT. I LIVE WHAT WE DO WITH THE RUN GAME, AND IT FITS HIS STRENGTHS WELL BECAUSE IT SETS UP A TON OF PLAY-ACTION GETS ABOUT THE MOVE. THAT'S WHEN I THINK HE IS AT THE BEST. KIRK: BY THE WAY, WHAT WAS THAT FIRST GAME LIKE IN 2006 WHEN THEY CAME BACK, FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT FROM THIS REGION? WHAT WAS THAT LIKE? DREW: THIS VANTAGE POINT, BLOCKING THE PARK RIGHT THERE, I HOPE IT DOES NOT HAPPEN TO US AND IT WAS THE SHOT HEARD AROUND THE WORLD. THAT WAS ALMOST THE MOST INCREDIBLE MOMENT IN SAINTS HISTORY. AL: AS I RECALL, STOPPING AT THE 31-YARD LINE, THAT HAPPENED EARLY, 1.5 INTO THE AND THE PLACE JUST EXPLODED. DREW: I HAVE NEVER HEARD THE DOME THAT LOUD. I NEVER HEARD THE DOM LOUD. IT MEANT THAT MUCH MORE. PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES, AND SOMEHOW THEY FIGURED OUT A WAY TO BUY SEASON TICKETS. WE DO NOT FEEL IT AS PRESSURE BUT SPOTS ABILITY. WE REPRESENTED OUR CITY, COMMUNITY, AND WE KNEW WE COULD LIFT YOUR SPIRITS AND PROCESS BY WINNING FOOTBALL AL: YOU AND SEAN PAYTON ARE A MATCH MADE IN FOOTBALL HEAVEN. SO THEY HONORED YOU AT A LUNCHEON TODAY, AND SEAN PAYTON SHOWS UP. DREW: IN ALL OF HIS BRONCOS GEAR, HIS BRONCOS HOODIE, ALONG WITH OTHER COACHES. 75% OF THE SIDELINE I PLAYED WITH HAD SOME INTERACTION OVER THE YEARS. AL: THE TIGHT END MAKES A CATCH. HE'S HAD A NICE NIGHT. KIRK: JIMMY GRAHAM. DREW: ONE OF THE GREATEST TEAMMATES EVER. AL: OF COURSE, REMEMBER -- I NEVER FORGOT, HE DID A PRODUCTION MEETING ONCE SAID, WHAT DOES YOUR WIFE THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU ARE DOING THIS? SHE SAID I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU. DREW: YOU HAVE TO GO TO A DIFFERENT PLACE WHEN YOU ARE DOWN THERE. I REMEMBER MATT STARTED IN THE 2007 SEASON. IT FELT LIKE SOMETHING WAS LACKING AND NEEDED TO BE DONE TO CREATE THE ENERGY AND EXCITEMENT FOR PREGAME AND LUCID CONFIDENCE. -- AND COMPETENCE. KIRK: BO NIX HAD PLANNED FOR A LOT OF US WATCHED BEFORE HE GOT THE PLAY, LOOKED AT HIS PHYSICAL ABILITY, AND HE REMINDED ME A LOT OF YOU AS FAR AS HIS APPROACH TO THE GAME, ATHLETIC ABILITY, AND HIS APPROACH AND HOW HE IS A NO-NONSENSE GUY. HAVE YOU WATCHED HIM MUCH? DREW: I WATCHED HIM A WHILE. I SAW HIM DO A LOT OF THINGS, AND I KNOW THAT HE IS REQUIRED IN THE QUARTERBACK POSITION. BO IS AT HIS BEST ON THE PERIMETER. I THINK WHERE HE CAN TAKE BALANCES IS THROWING FROM THE BEING ABLE TO GET THE BALL OUT ON TIME, AVOID PRESSURE, AND ALSO TO WIN THAT CONFIDENCE IF HE CAN BE UNDER CENTER A LITTLE MORE AND TURNED BACK OFFENSE MORE. KIRK: GO BACK TO YOUR ROOKIE YEAR, FOR THE FANS, WATCHING ROOKIE QUARTERBACKS, JUST THE SPEED OF THE GAME AND HOW DIFFERENT IT IS COMPARED TO YEAR 3, 4 AND FIVE, VERY DIFFERENT. YOU HERE. AL: THEY GET YOU ON A THIRD AND HE SETS UP A FIRST AND GOAL. DREW: HE LOOK LIKE JASON HOWELL WITH THAT. KIRK: WHAT IS GREAT IS YOU CAN USE THE FORMATION TO GO TO THE FIELD, AND THEY ARE ONE AND SHORT BACK THE OTHER WAY. DREW: GUY LIKE HIM WITH HIS ATHLETICISM, HE CAN GIVE YOU WHAT MOST CANNOT. THE GAME WILL STEADILY SLOW DOWN FROM HIM, ESPECIALLY AS IT PERTAINS TO THE DRAWBACK PASSING GAME. THEY DO HAVE SOME BIG TARGETS, SO YOU CAN GET COMPLETION, PUMP LAMENT THE RUN GAME AND GET SET UP FOR MUCH MORE FROM THEIR -- COMPLEMENT THE RUN GAME AND GET SET UP FOR MUCH MORE FROM THERE. AL: 79 RUSHING YARDS FOR NIX HE BURROWS HIS WAY INTO THE SO THE DENVER BRONCOS, 69 YARDS, FIVE PLAYS, FOUR ON THE GROUND. AND THE BRONCO FAITHFUL ARE HAPPY. ON THE ROAD. KIRK: WHAT WE HAVE SEEN THROUGHOUT THE GAME, ABILITY TO CONTROL THE LINE OF IT HAS NOT BEEN SOMETHING THAT NECESSARILY HAS BEEN A STRENGTH, BUT TODAY IT HAS BEEN. GREAT JOB -- LOOK AT THE PUSH UP FRONT, BACK FROM THAT JAVONTE WILLIAMS'S SINCE THE INJURY, AND YOU ARE S LOOKS GREAT. AL: RIGHT PROBABLY. AL: GOING ALL THE WAY BACK, JIM MOORE KIND OF HELP TO TURN THE FRANCHISE AROUND. EVERYBODY WAS WEARING THE BAGS UNTIL HIM. THEY HAD SOME REALLY GOOD YEARS, AND THEN SEAN PAYTON CAME AND YOU KNOW THE REST. 26-3, THE BRONCOS ON TOP. FROM THE FOUR, RUNNING THIS ONE YOU TALK ABOUT RATTLER. YOU COVER HIM, HE WAS IN OKLAHOMA, GOT OFF TO A GOOD START THERE, THEN HE GOES TO SOUTH CAROLINA. THE PASS IS LOW. HE IS A HEISMAN CANDIDATE, GOT THE NUMBER ONE DRAFT PICK. WHAT HAPPENED? KIRK: I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IS CALEB WILLIAMS EMERGED AND BECAME CALEB WILLIAMS. EVENTUALLY, IT TOOK A GUY, BEFORE THAT HAPPENED, HE WAS A HEISMAN FRONT RUNNER AND WAS GETTING BOOED OFF THE FIELD IN HIS OWN STADIUM. AND HE ENDED UP LOSING THE JOB. CALEB WILLIAMS WENT ON TO HAVE A GOOD YEAR, AND HE SAT THROUGH THAT YEAR, AND THEN AFTER THE SEASON, HE LEFT TO COLUMBIA HAD TWO GOOD YEARS AT SOUTH CAROLINA. IN THIS STAGE OF PORTAL, HE IS STAYING AND GREW. AND I THINK NOW HE GETS INTO THE NFL, AND HE IS GOING TO SIT BEHIND DEREK CARR, WHO IS BACK, WHICH IS GOOD FOR HIM, BUT I THINK THIS EXPERIENCE IS HU FOR HIS BROTHER. AL: WE TALKED ABOUT GETTING BOOED OFF THE FIELD. YOU KNOW, IN A WAY, YOU TALK ABOUT NIX AT AUBURN, THAT DID NOT END WONDERFULLY. KIRK: GARY SIMILARLY. -- VERY SIMILARLY. BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE GREW UP IN ALABAMA, HIS DAD WAS A GREAT QUARTERBACK THERE, AND NOW GREAT HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACH. THIS KID, FROM THE TIME HE TWO OR THREE HAD NOTHING BUT AUBURN JERSEYS. HE LIVED OUT HIS DREAM TO GO TO AUBURN, PLAY QUARTERBACK. AFTER HIS FIRST YEAR, I THINK THEY WERE 6-5, NOT GREAT, AND THEY BOOED HIM. SO HE LEFT, WENT OUT TO SO THEY BOTH HAD A SIMILAR PATH AS FAR AS GETTING ADVERSITY, WHICH AS I SAID, A LOT OF THESE NFL EXECUTIVES LIKE TO FIND QUARTERBACKS THAT ARE NOT PERFECT, THAT THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH SOME STUFF BECAUSE IT WILL OBVIOUSLY APPEARED TO THE NFL. AL: THAT WAS TIPTON ACHING THAT CATCH, EIGHT YARD GAIN -- MAKING THAT CATCH, EIGHT YARD GAIN. HE IS IN THE TRIPLE DIGITS RIGHT NOW, AND A NICE RUN RIGHT HERE FOR WILLIAMS. BACKUP. WILLIAMS CAME OVER AS A FREE AGENT AND HAD A 1000 YARD SEASON AS A LION. KIRK: WITH KENDRE MILLER BEHIND HIM, HE IS NOT GETTING A TON OF CARRIES, BUT HE GOT THAT ONE. AL: AND 17 TOUCHDOWNS WITH THE LIONS COUPLE OF YEARS BACK. RATTLER WILL SLIDE TO ESTOP. 3:50 REMAINING IN THE THIRD. BRONCOS HAVE THINGS AT THIS POINT WELL IN HAND. TIGHT END, AND WE GO TO KAYLEE. KAYLEE: ADD ANOTHER INJURY FOR THE SAINTS OFFENSIVE LINE, NICK SALDIVERI IS OUT WITH A SHOULDER INJURY. HE WAS A BACKUP FOR STARTER BECAUSE OF OTHER INJURIES, AND NOW IT HIS SPOT. AL: A ROOKIE OUT OF BOSTON COLLEGE. AND THE IT IS THAT KIND OF BACK FOR THE SAINTS AT THIS POINT. KIRK: NOW LANDON YOUNG, THE RIGHT GUARD, WHO WAS A BACKUP, HE IS A TACKLE THAT THEY MOVED THE GUARD. THAT IS WHERE THEY ARE. THEY HAD TO MOVE A TACKLE IN AT GUARD. AL: THAT IS ALL IT TAKES. SO IT IS FIRST AND 25, SO THE SEASON THAT STARTED SO PROMISINGLY FOR THE SAINTS, THAT COMING OFF THE RAILS. TWO BLOWOUT WINS TO GET THINGS STARTED. TIGHT GAME WITH PHILLY, THEY LOST IT. NOW ON THE VERGE OF GOING DOWN FOR THE FIFTH CONSECUTIVE GAME. CATCHES AT THE 43 BY MASON TIPTON, THE ROOKIE OUT OF YALE. NOT THE ONE IN TOWN, THE KEY COMPANY. I'M FINDING THIS AMUSING. SECOND AND 18. DATA CENTRIC WILSON. -- THAT IS CEDRIC WILSON. KIRK: ANYTIME YOU SEE A HELMET ON THE GROUND, HANDS OF THE OFFENSE. >> LEGAL HANDS TO THE FACE. NUMBER 60. AL:. GOOD. KIRK: IT IS LIKE REGISTERED KAYLEE TALK ABOUT KYLE HERGEL COMING IN, THE UNDRAFTED ROOKIE AGENT OUT OF BOSTON COLLEGE. HE GETS INTO THE GAME, HE GETS HIS HANDS OF PION D.J. JONES -- ACTUALLY THAT IS MALCOLM ROACH, A FORMER SAINT. IT IS LIKE THE SAINTS FANS HAVE SEEN ENOUGH. AL: NOT QUITE THOUGH. KIRK: NOW. AL: SECOND AND 28. DOWN HE GOES. FINALLY, THEY GET TO HIM. JOHN FRANKLIN-MYERS GETS THE SACK HERE. KIRK: AGAIN, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF LANDON YOUNG, THE RIGHT GUARD RIGHT HERE WHO IS A TACKLE, TRYING TO FIT IN TO BE A GUARD. FRANKLIN-MYERS, WHO THEY BROUGHT OVER FROM THE JETS, 6'4", 290. HE HAD WELCOME BROOCH, YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT, YOU ADD THOSE TWO WITH ZACH ALLEN AND D.J. JONES, SUCH A DIFFERENT DEFENSE THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THE PUSH THEY ARE NOW GETTING IN THE MIDDLE TO COMPLEMENT COOPER, ELLIS, BONITTO, AND BROWNING OUT ON THE EDGE. AL: WHAT IS ON YOUR PLACE YOU GET 30, 34? DECENT GAME, BREAKING TACKLES, UP TO THE 41-YARD LINE ROOKIE OUT OF PITTSBURGH. AND LIKE RATTLER, HE WAS DRAFTED IN THE FIFTH ROUND. THEY HAD A COUPLE OF CHOICES. HE JUST SAW THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THEM. FOURTH DOWN IN 20. -- AND 20. AND THERE WILL BE THE FIFTH PUNT OF THE NIGHT. SAINTS, MEANWHILE, THEY HAVE THEIR THURSDAY NIGHT GAME AND AFTER GREW TO THE CHARGERS ONE WEEK FROM SUNDAY TO L.A., AND THEN CAROLINA. FAIR CATCH CALLED FOR AT THE 16 YARD LINE. BY MARVIN. AND EIGHT FLAG. LINE OF SCRIMMAGE -- AND BY A LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. KIRK: SINCE THAT SECOND LAST WEEK AGAINST TAMPA WERE THEY SCORED 27 POINTS, SINCE THEN, THEY HAVE BEEN OUTSCORED 53-3, SECOND HALF, LAST WEEK. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN THESE FIRST THREE QUARTERS. AL: YOU TALK ABOUT A GOOD TEAMMATE, AND WE TALKED TO RATTLER ABOUT DEREK CARR -- >> NUMBER 48 WAS LINED UP I AL: THAT IS NOT ALWAYS HAPPEN. WITH A GUY LIKE CARR NUMBER, NUM SO NIX HAS DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB TONIGHT. 50-24, 161, 75 ON THE GROUND. FLAG. PAST ALONG THE SIDELINE. TAKING IN. WE WILL HEAR FROM CLARK AGAIN. KIRK: JAVONTE WILLIAMS PICK IT UP AND PASS, AND I HAVE TO HOLD. HE'S ONE OF THE BETTER PASS PROTECTING RUNS IN THE LEAGUE HE GOT CAUGHT THERE. >> HOLDING, OFFENSE. NUMBER 33. 10 YARD PENALTY. AL: INDEED, WILLIAMS. NOW WE GO ONCE MORE TO KAYLEE. KAYLEE: IT IS A BIG FOOTBALL WEEKEND FOR THE NIX FAMILY. BO'S MOM IS HERE TONIGHT, BUT HIS DAD, PATRICK, IS WATCHING FOR THE DUCKS. AL: YOU SEE MOM KRISTIN, PROUD OF HER BOY. FIRST AND 20. ANOTHER GOOD RUN ON THE GROUND FLOOR MCLAUGHLIN. HE'S APPROACHING AND HAS EXCEEDED 200 YARDS ON THE GROUND, 206. KIRK: THE OFFENSE OF LINE ARMS A LOT OF CREDIT. SEAN PAYTON REAL WITH WHAT HE'S SEEN FROM THE BIG BOYS UP FRONT. AL: ANYTHING WITH THAT BABY TONIGHT. MORE WITH OUR LOCAL ASTRONOMER IN A MOMENT. KAYLEE: IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT, THE INJURY BUG JUST RELENTLESS ON THE SAINTS SIDELINE. SEAN LATTIMORE, AFTER A VISIT TO THE MEDICAL TEAM HAS BEEN PULLED OUT OF THIS GAME BECAUSE HAMSTRING INJURY. HE SAT OUT TWO BECAUSE OF A HAMSTRING INJURY AS WELL. AN UPDATE ON THE OTHER QUARTERBACK, YOU SAW HIM IN THAT VACUUM SPLINT ON HIS RIGHT LEG. HE WENT TO THE AMBULANCE AND NOW HERE. AL: OUR BEST TO HIM. THEY LOST BOTH CORNERS, WE TALKED ABOUT ALL THE GUYS MISSING ON THE BENCH. THEY'VE GOT THREE EXTRA DAYS TO HEAL UP, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, AGAINST THE CHARGERS. MEANWHILE YOU'VE GOT A FOURTH DOWN HERE. FIRST DRIVE, THIS WAS THEIR EIGHTH DRIVE OF THE NIGHT AND IS NOT BEEN AT ONE POIN TERRITORY. KIRK: NOBODY HAS BEEN HIT LIKE THE SAINTS THIS YEAR. AL: THEY HAVE SOME COMPANY BUT THEY MIGHT BE NUMBER ONE IN THE CATEGORY. RILEY DIXON. FAIR CAUGHT AT THE 24 YARD LINE. A MINUTE AND A HALF INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER, IN NEW ORLEANS, 26-3 DENVER. KIRK: LET'S LOOK AT RELIABILITY REPORT PRESENTED BY XFINITY INTERNET. MOST RELIABLE HAS BEEN JAVONTE WILLIAMS, LOOK AT THAT HOLE HE IS HAVING A GREAT NIGHT. A COUPLE OF TOUCHDOWNS, FIRST TIME IN HIS CAREER HE'S BEEN ABLE TO GET A COUPLE OF SCORES. A LOT OF TALK ABOUT BO NIX BUT TO ME IT'S BEEN ABOUT WILLIAMS AND THE OFFENSE OF LINE AND THE RUN GAME TONIGHT. AL: THE PASS HERE LEVI WALLACE. KIRK: THIS DEFENSE ARE PLAYING WELL TONIGHT AGAINST THE SAINTS OFFENSE THAT'S BEAT UP. THIS DEFENSE, YOU CAN' THIS DEFENSE, YOU CAN'T LLAMA NOT OF -- LOT OF THEM. THEY HAVE PLAYED WELL TOGETHER AS A UNIT. AL: VANCE JOSEPH HAS DONE A NICE JOB, HE WAS THE HEAD COACH AT DENVER, THEN HE WENT TO ARIZONA AS THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR. THEN WHEN SEAN GOT THE JOB, HE BROUGHT HIM BACK. KIRK: HE IS A STUD. HE HAS RILEY MOSS ON ONE CORNER OPPOSITE SEARCH AND. -- AL: HE'S KIND OF LIKE HAD A LOT OF THE SAME PATH THAT RAHEEM MORRIS HAD. HAD NOT BEEN A HEAD COACH, GAMING D.C., HE' GAMING D.C., HE'S GOT ATLANTA PLAYING VERY WELL RIGHT NOW. PASS TO THE OUTSIDE IS CAUGHT BY MEANS, THE ROOKIE MAKES HIS SECOND GRAB. KIRK: IT REALLY SHOWS YOU THE WAY THIS DEFENSE CAN BECOME SOMETHING ELSE. TONIGHT THEY HAVE PLAYED PREDOMINANTLY IN THE ZONE. BECAUSE THEY ARE PLAYING AGAINST THIS YOUNG QUARTERBACK, THEY COMPLETELY CHANGE THE LOOK, PLAYING WAY MORE ZONE AND BLITZING. AL: HERE COMES THE SACK HERE. KIRK: AND THEN BAILED AT THE LAST SECOND TO CREATE A LITTLE CONFUSION FOR THE ROOKIE LEFT ALLOWED BONITTO TO COME AROUND AL: FIVE STRAIGHT GAMES NOW WITH THE SACK FOR BONITTO. THE BRONCOS ARE GOING TO TRY TO RATCHETED UP AND WIN TONIGHT. CAROLINA IN DENVER NEXT WEEK. THE SCHEDULE MAKERS DID NOT DO THEM ANY FAVORS. AT BALTIMORE, AND THEN AT KANSAS CITY, BACK TO BACK. KIRK: THAT'S TOUGH. THE AFC, KANSAS CITY IS GOING TO WIN THAT DIVISION MORE THAN LIKELY. YOU'VE GOT A SHOT AT THAT WILDCARD. AL: SEVEN TEAMS IN EACH CONFERENCE GOING IN. ANOTHER SACK HERE. THIS NOT OF MISERY IN A WAY WILL CONTINUE. ANOTHER SACK HERE, THIS TIME ZACH ALLEN, CAME OVER FROM ARIZONA. FOUR SACKS TONIGHT FOR THE BRONCOS. KIRK: HE IS RELENTLESS. A GREAT PLAYER. AL: THE BRONCOS CAME INTO THE GAME SECOND IN THE LEAGUE IN SACKS. 22, THEY ARE NOW AT 26. THIS WILL WE PUNT NUMBER SIX. DRIFTING, MAKING THE FAIR CATCH AT THE 15. 10:34 LEFT IN REGULATION. STORY OF THE NIGHT IF YOU ARE A SAINTS FAN, RIGHT THERE. LOOK AT NEXGEN STATS, POWERED BY AWS. YARDS BEFORE CONTACT TELLS YOU THE JOB THE OFFENSE OF LINE HAS DONE. 114 YARDS AFTER CONTACT, KIND OF EXPECTED THAT WAS SOME OF THE SAINTS TACKLING. AND PLUS 40 RUNS YARDS OVER EXPECTED. ALL THREE OF THOSE ARE SEASON HIGHS AND THE BENEFICIARY IS BO NIX AND THE OFFENSE TONIGHT. AL: DENVER HAS 372 TOTAL YARDS. THE SAINTS DEFENSE POROUS AGAIN, SHREDDED FOR ALMOST 600 YARDS TOTAL LAST WEEK. TO THE OUTSIDE, AROUND THE CORNER. WE' WE'LL CHALK UP ANOTHER 15 OR 16. KIRK: YOU ALWAYS WONDER IF THEY HAD A HOLD ON THE EDGE THERE. AL: THAT SAINTS DEFENSE IS GOING -- 51 POINTS LAST WEEK, ONLY HALF OF THAT TONIGHT. BUT ALMOST 400 YARDS OF OFFENSE. >> NUMBER 79 IS ELIGIBLE. AL: MEANWHILE DENVER HAS NOT EVEN BEEN TARGETED. YOU WOULD THINK THAT REALLY WOULD HAVE NEEDED HIM. FINALLY THERE ABLE TO SMOTHER WILLEMS IN THE BACK FIELD. SECOND DOWN AND 19. KIRK: JUST A MISCOMMUNICATION IN THE INTERIOR MADE IT EASY FOR ORJI TO GET IN THERE. DENVER HAS NOT GOTTEN BEHIND THE STICKS MUCH TONIGHT WITH PENALTIES AND MISCUES. IT'S BEEN A PRETTY CLEAN GAME. AL: THEY WANTED TO RUN IT AND THEY HAVE DONE THAT IN DEED. 31 RUNS, ONLY 25 PASS PLAYS. NOT DOWN AT THE LINE OF IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 19. KIRK: YOU LOOK AT THIS TEAM AND WHO THEY HAVE COMING UP, YOU MENTIONED KANSAS CITY AND BALTIMORE OUT OF THAT CAROLINA WITH THE DEFENSE AND THE SPECIAL TEAMS THEY PLAY, I THINK SEAN PAYTON IS CONFIDENT THEY CAN BE COMPETITIVE IN A LOT OF THESE JUST A MATTER OF CAN THEY CONTINUE TO DO THIS, TO GEL AND DEVELOP UPFRONT WITH THE CONTINUITY OF THAT OFFENSE OF LINE AND WHAT THEY HAVE COMING JAVONTE WILLIAMS, CAN HE STAY HEALTHY AND RUN THIS FOOTBALL? BO NIX, WE KNOW HE'S JUST GOING TO GET BETTER EVERY SINGLE WEEK. AL: THIRD AND 19. OUT TO THE 16 YARD LINE GOES JAVONTE WILLIAMS AS HE HONES IN ON 100 YARDS TONIGHT. 91 ON THE GROUND FOR HIM. RILEY DIXON WILL COME IN. IT'S BEEN AN OFF NIGHT FOR HIM. HE'S AVERAGING SIX PINTS AGAIN. THIS WILL ONLY BE HIS THIRD -- SIX PUNTS A GAME. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS AND YOU DON'T CONVERT VERY OFTEN ON THEY HAVE DONE ENOUGH OF A JOB TO KEEP HIM ON THE SIDELINE. 39 YARD LINE. JACKSON, STARTS ONE WAY, GOES THE OTHER. FORCED OUT OF BOUNDS. KIRK: CONNOR MCDAVID, MAYBE THE BEST EVER. AL: WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY PAL WAYNE GRETZKY, HE IS RIGHT MEANWHILE WE TALK ABOUT DEREK CARR, MISSING HIS SECOND STRAIGHT GAME. I KNOW HE'D LIKE TO PLATE NEXT THEY ARE NOT SURE OF THAT, PROBABLY THE FOLLOWING WEEK. THEY WERE SAYING HIS WHOLE CAREER HAS BEEN WITH THE RAIDERS, COMES OVER HERE. THE CATCH IS MADE BY JOHNSON. KIRK: TALKED TO HIM ON THE FIELD BEFORE THE GAME. EVERY TIME AT THIS POINT OF HIS REHAB, EVERY TIME HE TRIES TO THURN -- TURN AND PRO, THAT THROWING MOTION ON THE FIELD, CONTINUING TO DOUBLE DOWN. HE'S DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN TO GET BACK. AL: INCOMPLETE, COVERED ON PLAY BY RILEY MOSS. FOURTH DOWN. 7:31 ON THE CLOCK IN THE FOURTH. I WONDER IF HE CAME WITH AT SIGN ALREADY MADE. KIRK: IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS ALREADY PREPARED. AL: VERY PROFESSIONAL. KIRK: HE IS ANTICIPATING THIS. AL: RATTLER, A LITTLE SHOVEL DUMP TO ALVIN KAMARA AND THEY TURNED THE BALL OVER ON DOWNS. 7:25 REMAINING. AND WE WILL BE BACK. I PROMISE. AL: THURSDAY NIGHT NEXT WEEK, LOS ANGELES, THE RAMS WILL PLAY THE RAIDERS ON SUNDAY. VIKINGS WILL PLAY THE LIONS ON SUNDAY AND THEY GO INTO THAT GAME UNBEATEN. MATTHEW STAFFORD WITH THE RAMS. NEXT WEEK. KIRK: BACK IN THE SADDLE. AL: WE FELL OFF THE HORSE KIRK: THIS IS PAYBACK. AL: 15 YARD GAIN CARRY ESTIMATE. MEANWHILE WE HAVE BO NIX, HE AND SEAN PAYTON THE SIDELINES. KIRK: WHAT I LOVE IS SEAN PAYTON, WHEN HE TALKED TO US, HE SAID THAT'S MY LOVE LANGUAGE. HE LIKED SEEING HIS ROOKIE QUARTERBACK GETTING A LITTLE FEISTY THERE. WAS THAT THE GAME AFTER THE GAME HE SAID FERRIS BUEHLER? AL: I THINK THAT WAS IT, HE SAID HE REMINDED HIM OF FERRIS BUEHLER ON HIS DAY OFF. KIRK: I NEVER SAW HIM LIKE THAT. AL: NO, NEVER. FERRIS WAS PRETTY CHILL. >> INELIGIBLE PLAYER DOWNFIELD. FIVE YARD PENALTY, REPLAY FIRST KAYLEE: BO NIX HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO BE COACH HARD, ACCORDING TO HIS DAD, PATRICK. PATRICK TOLD ME FROM THE TIME BO WAS FOUR YEARS OKLAHOMA WHETHER HE WAS PLAYING T-BALL OR FLAG FOOTBALL, HE WAS THERE TO COMPETE AND WIN. FROM HIS FIRST MEETING WITH SEAN PAYTON, BO SAID THEY WOULD BE A GOOD FIT. HE NEEDS SOMEONE TO BE A LITTLE FIERY WITH HIM BECAUSE THAT'S HIS PERSONALITY. FIRST AND 15 NOW AFTER THAT PENALTY. THE SAINTS HAVE IT. RECOVERED WITH 6:10 REMAINING IN THE FOURTH. KIRK: HE GOT THAT BALL OUT BEFORE HE HIT THE SURFACE. YOU LOVE TO SEE GUYS STILL COMPETE WITH THIS GAME WELL OUT OF REACH. ESTIMATE IS A GUY TRYING TO GET MORE CARRIES, TRYING TO IMPROVE. WERE TALKING ABOUT FRANKLIN AND VELE AND ESTIME. HE GETS A FEW CARRIES. AL: FIVE CARRIES FOR HIM MEANWHILE THE SAINTS WHO HAVE HAD TERRIBLE FIELD POSITION ALL NIGHT, COVERAGES GOOD. DOWN GOES KENDRE MILLER FOR A LOSS. KIRK: I FEEL LIKE YOU WATCH NFL, YOU WATCH SEVEN OR EIGHT GAMES A WEEK, DENVER IS JUST SOUND. VANCE JOKES THAT WHAT HE HAS TO LOVE ABOUT THIS GROUP IS THEY ARE JUST IN THE RIGHT SPOT AND THAT PLAY WELL AS A UNIT. THEY LEVERAGE THE FOOTBALL, THERE'S TWO GUYS THERE. AL: NUMBER 55, THEY PICKED HIM UP FROM WASHINGTON. KIRK: STRNAD HAS DONE A GREAT JOB SINCE HE HAS BEEN IN THERE, VERY PRODUCTIVE. AL: THIRD AND NINE. THE TACKLE IS MADE BOUGHT MOST, SAVING THE FIRST DOWN. WILSON MAKES THE GROUND. IT WILL BE FOURTH AND 2. KIRK: MOSS IN HIS SECOND YEAR OUT OF IOWA. A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT GUYS, HE HAS REALLY EMERGED TO BECOME A TIGHT CORNER ON THAT SIDE. AL: THAT WILL CONVERT AS WILSON MAKES THAT CATCH FOR A FIRST SAINTS WERE SHUT OUT OF THE LAST TWO QUARTERS LAST WEEK. ONE FIELD GOAL, RATTLER STOPPED AT THE 34 YARD LINE. KIRK: THE OTHER THING THEY'RE ABLE TO DO IS ROTATE A LOT OF BODIES, ESPECIALLY ON THAT EDGE. THESE OUTSIDE LINEBACKERS AL:. SECOND, LOOK OUT. IS THAT GOING TO BE A THAT IS TAKEN BY BARTON IN THE AIR? THERE IS NO WHISTLE YET. BARTON -- THE BALL IS BEING RELEASED FOR THE MOMENT. RULED A TOUCHDOWN. KIRK: IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER IT'S A FUMBLE OR AN INTERCEPTION, HE CAUGHT THAT IN THE AIR. MCMILLAN CAME COME THEY HAVE NOT BLITZED A TIME. THIS TIME THEY DIAL IT UP. THEY BROUGHT BOTH THE LINEBACKER AND ALSO MCMILLAN. SEE HIM LOOPING AROUND, BUT THIS IS WHERE THE PRESSURE ACTUALLY GETS HOME. NOBODY SEES HIM OFF THAT SPOT AL: A 52 YARD RETURN OFF AN AND BARTON, MEANWHILE A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM GO FOR TWO HERE, BUT THEY WILL SETTLE FOR ONE. THE KICK IS GOOD. AND THE SCORE IS NOW 33-3. THEY EVEN BROUGHT CONDOLEEZZA RICE INTO THE MEETING WHEN THEY HIRED SEAN PAYTON AS PART OF THE INTERVIEW PROCESS. THAT IS THE BIG TIME. SEAN NOW IN HIS SECOND YEAR THE RUNBACK SO THE BRONCOS WITH THE BRAND-NEW FACILITY. A BRAND-NEW TRAINING FACILITY, TEAM HEADQUARTERS IN INGLEWOOD, COLORADO. KIRK: GREAT FOOTBALL TOWN, THEY OBVIOUSLY LOVE THE BRONCOS. AL: IT'S A FRANCHISE THAT HAS BEEN THROUGH STRUGGLES. THEY WON THREE WITH ELWAY BACK TO BACK, THEN WINNING SUPER BOWL A NICE RUN HERE, AGAIN OF 16 FOR KENDRE MILLER. GO BACK TO THE ORANGE CRUSH DAYS BACK IN THE 1970'S. HERE WE GO. LIFE AFTER DREW. WE HAD DREW IN THE BOOTH MEANWHILE, THE INJURED BRONCO, FOR THE MOMENT. IT'S INTERESTING, THE BRONCOS WITH SEAN, MIKE SHANAHAN WAS THERE FOR 14 YEARS, TWO SUPER BOWLS, JOHN ELWAY RIDING OFF INTO THE ROCKY MOUNT SUNSET. SINCE IN THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH EIGHT OR NINE HEAD COACHES. MAYBE THEY HAVE FINALLY FOUND THEIR MAN. SEAN WAS OUT FOR A YEAR, WENT INTO TELEVISION BUT HE MISSED THE SCOREBOARD. WIN, LOSE, WHATEVER. YOU DON'T TELEVISION. KIRK: I FOUND IT INTERESTING THAT HE WAS OUT ONE YEAR, THEN HE WAS ABLE TO FIND AN BUT THEN IT WOULD JUST KIND OF FADE AWAY AFTER WE WERE DONE, AND I JUST MISSED I HAD TO PRACTICE THE COMPETITIVE SPIRIT THAT HE HAS. HE STILL HAS A LOT IN HIM AND I THINK HE FEELS HE CAN LEAD THAT FRANCHISE BACK TO THAT SUPER BOWL YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. AL: THAT WAS MATHIS WHO W OFF ON HIS OWN POWER, THE INJURED BRONCO. AT THE 37 YARD LINE. KEEP IT ON THE GROUND, NICE RUN KIRK: KIND OF A SLASHER KID OUT OF TCU, THE SECOND YEAR, HE HAS BATTLED THROUGH SOME INJURIES. KIND OF REPETITIVE COMMENTS ABOUT THE SAINTS. AL: SECOND AND ONE. IS FIRED AND INCOMPLETE. JOHNSON COULD NOT HOLD ON. THIRD DOWN AND ONE. AGAIN, THE BRONCOS IN A WILL HAVE CAROLINA, THEN KANSAS CITY. KANSAS CITY HAS BEEN THEIR NEMESIS FOR A LONG TIME. DIDN'T PLAY VERY WELL IN THAT ONE GAME AGAINST THEM LAST YEAR WE HAD A THURSDAY NIGHT GAME. THEY WILL TAKE IT OUT OF BOUNDS HERE, KENDRE MILLER. ANDY REID, THE WHOLE GANG. AFTER TONIGHT, EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT CALEB WILLIAMS, 4-2 WITH CHICAGO, JAKE DANIELS WITH WASHINGTON. THEY MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE MORE NOTABILITY AFTER TONIGHT. KIRK: WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CALEB WILLIAMS AND JAKE DANIELS, THEY HAVE A LOT OF SPLASH PLACE. TO ME, IT'S ABOUT QUARTERBACKING. IT'S ABOUT HAVING A GOOD DEFENSE, PLAYING COMPLEMENTARY THEY HAVE GREAT SPECIAL TEAMS. THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THAT FOR THE MOST PART TONIGHT. IF THEY COME -- IF THEY CAN PLAY SMART WITH BO NIX WITH THIS DEFENSE, THEY WILL BE COMPETITIVE. AL: SLIDES THROUGH A HOLE HERE AT THE 48 YARD LINE. KIRK: HE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT FEELING 100% OUT THERE HIMSELF. AL: EMOTIONALLY AS WELL. THIRD DOWN AND FIVE AS THE CLOCK KEEPS ON ROLLING TO THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING. AND THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING IS UPON US. JAKE HAENER WHO HAS NOW COME IN. THAT PASS IS JUGGLED AND NOT CAUGHT BY TIPTON. YOU'VE GOT PASS INTERFERENCE COMING UP HERE AGAINST DENVER. THAT WILL GIVE THEM AN AUTOMATIC HAENER GOT INTO A COUPLE OF GAMES EARLY ON BUT IT WAS TWO BLOWOUT WINS. OUT OF FRESNO STATE, AS IS DEREK CARR, CHECK OUT RENTAL ON THE SIDELINE. KIRK: MUCH MORE OF A DISTRIBUTOR, GET THE BALL OUT OF HIS HANDS QUICK. AL: HE DOES THERE AND HITS MASON TIPTON THERE. LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO CHASED BY MCMILLAN, TAKEN DOWN. KIRK: ON THE INTERCEPTION. AL: INSULT TO INJURY. TALKING ABOUT SEAN PAYTON SUPER BOWL IN HIS FOURTH YEAR HERE, 2009. GETTING -- THE CITY GETTING RESURRECTED AFTER KATRINA HIT IN AUGUST OF 2005. DREW BREES TAKES OVER THERE AND THE SAINTS WIN THE SUPER BOWL. WHAT A NIGHT. KIRK: WHAT I REMEMBER ABOUT THAT IS DREW BREES' SON HE WAS, HOLDING HIM, A LITTLE GUY. ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES HE WAS HOLDING THE HEADPHONES TO TRY TO PROTECT HIM FROM THE NOISE. AL: BIG SPORTS ILLUSTRATED COVER STORY ON DREW AT THAT TIME. SECOND DOWN AND ONE. HAELN HAEENER STEPS INTO THE POCKET. A TON OF DROPPED PASSES AND MISSED TACKLES TONIGHT. KIRK: A LOT OF STUFF TO CLEAN A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT WITH HAENER AS THE BACKUP HE MIGHT GET AN OPPORTUNITY WHEN CARR WENT DOWN, AND RIGHT ON HER WENT FROM BEING THE STARTER THE LAST COUPLE OF GAMES. I THINK HE BRINGS A LITTLE BIT OF JUICE TO THE OFFENSE, HIS PERSONALITY. HE MOVES AROUND A LOT BETTER THAN HAENER. AL: THAT'S A FIRST DOWN AND MORE. AT THE 11 YARD LINE GOES CEDRIC WILSON. KIRK: HAENER GETS THE BALL OUT. IF YOU WERE GOING TO STATE HIS CASE WHY HE SHOULD GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO THROW, EVEN IF THEY PRESSURE ME, I'M NOT GOING TO RUN AROUND, I'M GOING TO GET THE BALL OUT. HE MOVES A BIT SLOWER IN THE SEASON, RIGHT AWAY HAS AN ANSWER TO GET THE BALL OUT OF HIS HANDS AND GET THE FIRST DOWN WITH CEDRIC WILSON. AL: THEY TAKE A TIMEOUT HERE WHICH IS MUSIC TO THE EARS OF SOME OF OUR REP PROBATE FRIENDS. KIRK: WE ARE VERY CLOSE HERE. AL: WE ARE. 33-3 IS THE SCORE. HOW IT STARTED, HOW IT'S GOING, THE FIRST TWO GAMES, EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT. HOW ABOUT THEM SAINTS? THE LAST FIVE, YUCK. FROM THE 12. FIRED, CAUGHT, TOUCHDOWN. KIRK: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT IT'S THAT QUICK RELEASE AND THE DOLLED UP PRESSURE IN THE RED ZONE. THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE RED ZONE DEFENSE IN THE NFL IN THE BALL HAS NOT GOTTEN OUT LIKE THIS ALL HE IS IN HIS SECOND YEAR WOULD LOOK AT ALL THOSE WHITE JERSEYS. TRYING TO CREATE SOME CONFUSION, MAKE HIM HESITANT. HE SEES IT RIGHT AWAY AND IT IS OUT OF HIS HANDS, AND IT IS ACCURATE. A COUPLE OF NICE ROSE FOR NUMBER THREE. AL: NOW YOU CAN SAY THE GAME IS OFFICIALLY KIRK: I THINK SO. AL: GOT TO KEEP AN AUDIENCE, WHAT CAN I TELL YOU. SEAN PAYTON, MIKE WESTOFF, THE LONGTIME SPECIAL TEAMS COACH. SEAN PAYTON DOESN'T LIKE TO GIVE CIRCUMSTANCE. THEY BRING IN HAENER AND ALL HE DOES THIS GO THREE OUT OF FOUR FOR 38 YARDS AND A TOUCHDOWN. SO HERE WE GO, IF CARR CAN PLAY IN THE NEXT GAME, WHAT DO YOU DO? KIRK: BASED ON WHAT WE JUST SAW, THAT IS THE BEST EXECUTION THAT WE HAVE SEEN ALL NIGHT. AL: THAT'S 1:38, WHATEVER IT WAS. KIRK: HOW QUICKLY HE MADE THE DECISION AND HOW THE BALL GOT OUT AND HOW ACCURATE HE THROWS IT. I THINK NEXT GAME YOU MIGHT WANT TO SEE HIM UNDER CENTER, JUST SEE IF HE CAN KEEP THAT GOING. AL: THE NEXT GAME WILL BE IN L.A. AGAINST THE CHARGERS SUNDAY. THEN THEY GO TO CHARLOTTE TO MEET THE PANTHERS. SO THEY HAVE DECLARED FOREIGN ONSIDE KICK, WHICH YOU HAVE TO DO THESE DAYS. IN THE PUNTER WILL TRY TO KICK IT THE NEEDED 10 YARDS. AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SECURE POSSESSION AGAIN. KIRK: DENVER CALLED A TIMEOUT JUST TO KEEP YOU HONEST. WANT TO MAKE SURE WE USE OUR FULL ALLOTMENT. AL: THEY STILL HAVE ONE I DON'T THINK SO, WE WILL SEE. DENNIS ALLEN, OF A MAN WHO VERY MUCH IS GOING TO TAKE SOME HEAT. YOU LOSE FIVE IN A ROW AND EVERY COACH IS GOING TO TAKE SOME HEAT. KIRK: HE'S NOT GOING TO EVER SAY INJURIES. PEOPLE JUST SAY 2-0, WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FIVE >> I'M NOT MAKING EXCUSES FOR HIM, YOU LOSE YOUR STARTING QUARTERBACK, YOUR TOP TWO RECEIVERS, TWO OF YOUR BEST OFFENSIVE LINEMAN. UP ON THE DEFENSIVE SIDE. IT'S REALLY TOUGH TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN LEVEL WHEN YOU HAVE THAT MANY INJURIES. AL: AND NUMBER TWO OUT ON A CONCUSSION LAST WEEK. HERE COMES THE ATTEMPTED ONSIDE KICK WHICH WILL BE SECURED BY THE DENVER BRONCOS. P.J. LOCKE LOCKS IT UP. WHAT A WORD MASTER I AM. KIRK: WELL, YOU BEEN DOING IT FOR SO LONG. AL: 31 GAMES WITH MY GUYS. KIRK: WHAT WAS THE FIRST YEAR YOU CAME IN HERE? AL: I ACTUALLY DID A GAME HERE IN 1975. I DID GAME LATE IN THE SEASON WITH HANK STRAM ON CBS. WE WERE GOING TO HAVE DINNER THE NIGHT BEFORE THE GAME AND HE SAID I CAN'T, BECAUSE THE OWNER OF THE TEAM WANTS TO HAVE DINNER WITH ME. AND I SAID HE'S GOING TO TRY TO HIRE YOU, AND HE DID. AND THEN HANK CAME HERE AFTER HE GOT BARBARA KANSAS CITY AND WAS WORKING ONE YEAR FOR CBS. HE COMES HERE AND COACHES THE KIRK: FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. AL: THEN GOT BACK INTO BROADCASTING. DID A GREAT JOB WITH JOE BUCK. THE BRONCOS WOULD HAVE A HAPPY KIRK: ALL THE TALK ABOUT SEAN PAYTON COMING BACK, IT WAS COOL HE WENT THIS AFTERNOON TO CELEBRATE DREW BREES. THOSE TWO WILL BE CONNECTED FOREVER IN THIS TOWN AND FOR FOOTBALL FANS. AND HE WAS ABLE TO GET THE WIN, SO MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. HE WANTED TO PAY TRIBUTE AND ALSO BRING HIS TEAM ON A BUSINESS TRIP BACK TO NEW ORLEANS AND GET THE W, 33-10. ONWARD, GET READY FOR THE ONE. AL: THAT TAKES US TO THE 40 SECOND MARK, WHICH MEANS NO MORE PLAY IS NECESSARY. TO SEAN PAYTON, COMES BACK 15 YEARS AS THE SAINTS HEAD COACH. COMES OVER WITH HIS MAN DENNIS ALLEN WAS HIS ASSISTANT 12 YEARS. TWO DIFFERENT TENURES. MIKE WESTOFF ALSO COMING OVER TO SHAKE HIS HAND AS WELL. AND THE DENVER BRONCOS ARE ABOVE 500, AT 4-3. BO NIX, A GOOD NIGHT FOR HIM. 75 YARDS ON THE GROUND AS THE BRONCOS WIN IT BY A SCORE OF 33-10.
