THE FIELD IS WILLIAMS. >> YOU FACE THE VIKINGS WITH THE SECOND RANKED RUN DEFENSE, WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO HAVE SUCCESS? >> CONFIDENCE, BELIEF, IT IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE, NOTHING WE DON'T ALREADY KNOW. >> YOU WILL GET SOME HELP WITH THE RETURN OF COOPER CUP. HOW CAN THEIR PRESENCE CHANGE YOUR ATTACK? >> THEY GET OPEN AND MAKE STUFF HAPPEN, SO THEY BRING A LOT OF THREATS TO THE DEFENSE AND I AM EXCITED, EXCITED. AL: RAMS FANS ARE EXCITED, THERE IS COOPER KUPP, BUT NOT NECESSARILY READY. THE TWO GUYS WHO WERE TOGETHER FOR 24 SNAPS ARE BOTH IN ACTION. RAMS WINNING THE TOSS, ETHAN EVANS HAS HAD 29 KICKOFFS AND 28 TOUCHBACKS AND ONE. SO MUCH FOR THE DYNAMIC KICKOFF WITH THIS GUY. VIKINGS WILL START. SAM DARNOLD WENT TO USC, NUMBER THREE PICK OVERALL, BAKER MAYFIELD WENT FIRST WITH THE JETS. THEY SENT HIM TO CAROLINA. MCCARTHY IS GONE FOR THE SEASON. AARON JONES, FORMER PACKER CJ AND THEY START WITH JONES TO THE 35 YARD LINE. KEVIN O'CONNELL IS HERE AND WAS OFFENSE OF COORDINATOR AGAINST CINCINNATI. SEAN IS IN HIS EIGHTH SEASON AS THE HEAD COACH OF THE RAM. WHAT A COACHING TREE HE HAS DEVELOPED. ON SECOND DOWN AND FIVE, THE PASS IS CAUGHT, JEFFERSON IS TACKLED BY WILLIAMS AND IT IS FIRST DOWN. KIRK: JEFFERSON AND SAM DARNOLD OFF TO A SLOW START, THREE RECEPTIONS GOING BACK TO JOE BURROW AT LSU, JEFFERSON LIKE A LOT OF THE GREAT ONES LIKES TO GET HIS HANDS ON THE BALL, GOOD JOB BY SAM DARNOLD MAKING THE THROW. HOW: TWO TIGHT ENDS IN THIS, NICE MOVE BY JONES. GETS TO THE OUTSIDE AND THEN HE BREAKS AWAY FROM THE RAMS NUMBER ONE AND IT IS SECOND DOWN AND SHORT. KIRK: HECK OF A BLOCK BY JORDAN, SPRINTS TO THE OUTSIDE. AL: JONES WILL TAKE THE BALL INTO THE RAMS TERRITORY. KIRK: HE DOES A GOOD JOB OF MANAGING, IT HAS BEEN A BIG STORY THIS YEAR, THE JOB NOT JUST SAM IS DOING, BUT THE POSITION KEVIN O'CONNELL PUT HIM IN ALLOWS HIM TO GIVE HIM LAST-MINUTE ADJUSTMENTS. AL: SAM DARNOLD LOOKING DOWN THE FIELD, COMPLETION, JEFFERSON TO THE 25 YARD LINE, VIKINGS ARE VERY STRONG AND THE RAMS SAFETY IS DOWN. INJURY TIMEOUT, ANOTHER SPECTACULAR SEASON. KIRK: THIS IS AN AREA WHERE HE HAS WORKED TO BECOME NEXT LEVEL. WES PHILLIPS SAID WITH THE ABILITY TO PUSH THE BALL DOWN THE FIELD BEING MORE CLEAN WAS A IT IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY, KIM RETURN FOR A TOUCHDOWN, A ROOKIE OUT OF MIAMI WILL TAKE HIS SPOT, THE SAFETY SPOT IN THE DRIVE RESUMES FOR MINNESOTA. PICKS UP ABOUT FOUR, SECOND DOWN AND SIX. KIRK: CHRIS SHULA IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT LIFE WITHOUT AARON DONALD, AS A FIRST-TIME DEFENSIVE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR THAT USE TO PLAY SHELL DEFENSE, YOU'VE GOT KOBIE TURNER AND SOME OTHERS TRYING TO BE MORE CREATIVE WITH STUNTS AND BLITZING, TRYING TO FIND THAT IDENTITY. AL: SAM DARNOLD SECOND AND SEVENTH, SHOULDER SHAKE, FIRES IT UP THE MIDDLE, CAUGHT. WILLIAMS MAKES THE TACKLE AND IT IS FIRST AND GOAL FOR THE VIKINGS. KIRK: NOW YOU'VE GOT POINT PLAYING, HE IS AN EDGE GUY BUT THESE MIDDLE LINEBACKERS WITH THEIR EYES IN THE BACKFIELD ARE GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THE VIKINGS DID A GREAT JOB OF ATTACKING THE INTERIOR BEHIND THE LINEBACKERS AND FINDING JEFFERSON AND SAM DARNOLD ABLE TO MAKE THAT THROW. ALL DRIVE BY THE VIKINGS. AL: THEY HAVE OUTSCORED 58-3 OVER SIX GAMES. WIDE OPEN, TOUCHDOWN. JOSH OLIVER, SO SAM DARNOLD COMES BACK TO LOS ANGELES, 4-4 ON THAT DRIVE AND SIX-NOTHING, GOING ON SEVEN. KIRK: WATCH THE SAFETY TRYING TO COMMUNICATE AND NOW WATCH THE SAFETY TRY TO LOCATE, I'VE GOT TO GET OVER THERE. JUST A LITTLE THING, WHAT THEY DO BEFORE THE SNAP REALLY CAN IMPACT THE PLAY CALL TO PRODUCE TOUCHDOWNS. AL: THE ROOKIE HAS HAD A PERFECT SEASON, THAT CONTINUES. KAYLEE: -- AL: THEY'VE ONLY ALLOWED THREE, THIS IS LIKE HORSE RACING AND IN THEIR FIRST FIVE GAMES THEY ARE THE HORSE, WIRE TO WIRE. OVERTAKEN DOWN THE BACKSTRETCH AND THEN THE, THEY GOT BEATEN AT THE WIDER. KIRK: I LIKE THOSE ANALOGIES, I LIKE THOSE COMPARISON. AL: RAMS WITH STAFFORD WILL TAKE OVER. FOR MATTHEWS IT HAS BEEN A ROUGH YEAR. RECEIVERS ARE BACK TONIGHT AND THE OFFENSIVE LINE, THREE OF THEIR STARTERS ARE ON INJURED RESERVE. KIRK: A ROOKIE OUT OF ARKANSAS, LEFT GUARD. ANOTHER ROOKIE, A FREE AGENT. GOING UP AGAINST BRIAN FLOREZ IN A COMPLEX DEFENSE. AL: THEY DID NOT WASTE ANY TIME AND IT IS DROPPED THERE. SO THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH WILL THEY PLAY TONIGHT, IS HE GOING TO PLAY? HE IS ACTIVE, HE IS RIGHT THERE, THE PASS IS THERE, HE COULD NOT HOLD ON. KIRK: AS GOOD AS HE IS, LOOK AT HIS EYES, HE'S STARTING TO LOOK UP AND HE DID NOT HAVE THE BALL SECURED, HE LOSES IT. THERE THEY GO, WALKING GUYS, -- AL: HE MAKES THIS CATCH, BREAKING TACKLE AT THE 44 YARD LINE, JACKSON, LEFT TACKLE, SPRINGING INTO A NICE DOWN. KIRK: THAT FREED HIM UP TO HAVE SOME SPACE. THEY WALKED SIX UP HERE AND YOU MOVE COOPER KUPP, WATCH THE LINEBACKERS, THEN THROW BACK THE OTHER WAY. WELL-DESIGNED BY SEAN MCVAY. AL: THE MAN IN MOTION, THERE IS WILLIAMS WITH A BIG HOLE. UP 13 AND KIRK: KYREN WILLIAMS, A LOT OF ATTENTION HAS BEEN ON STAFFORD. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE OFFENSE? INJURIES. BUT WHEN YOU GET THESE TWO RECEIVERS BACK, THESE ARE BIG GUYS. 6'2", 210. THEY BLOCK WELL. THE BENEFICIARY IS NOT JUST STAFFORD, IT IS THE RUN GAME, AS WELL. AL: WILLIAMS WITH A TOUCHDOWN IN NINE CONSECUTIVE GAMES. STAFFORD THROWS IT TO THE LEFT, HITS TYLER JOHNSON. THAT WILL SET UP A SECOND DOWN AND 4. YOU LOOK AT BRIAN FLORES, THE VIKINGS DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR. KIRK: YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE ABOUT YOUR DEFENSE? YOU LOOK AT ALL THE GUYS ON THE DEFENSE, THEY BROUGHT IN FOUR OR FIVE NEW FACES. THEY ALL HAVE CHIPS ON THEIR SHOULDER. BRIAN FLORES HAS A BIT OF A CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER AS A DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR. A PERFECT MARRIAGE OF INTENSITY AND HOW THEY PLAY WITH OTHER AL: TIMEOUT TAKEN HERE BY THE RAMS WITH 8:30 TO GO IN THE QUARTER. THE VIKINGS FELT GOOD ENOUGH ABOUT THE GUYS THEY BROUGHT IN TO LET THE DEAL HUNTER OUT THE DOOR. KIRK: HOW ABOUT ANDREW VAN GINKEL COMING OVER FROM MIAMI? HE HAS BEEN ASKED TO DO A LOT OF THINGS ON DEFENSE. BLAKE CASHMAN CAME OVER FROM HOUSTON. HE IS THE COMMUNICATOR, THE MIDDLE LINEBACKER. HE IS NOT DRESSED SO THEY ARE HAPPY TO COME UP WITH ANSWERS WITHOUT HIM. YOU SEE VAN GINKGO MOVING AROUND EVEN MORE. -- YOU CAN SEE VAN GINKGO MOVING AROUND. IT HAS BEEN A GREAT START TO THE AL: MOTION BY NACUA. PLAY FAKE. NACUA TAKES THE PASS AND NACUA IS INSIDE THE 30, INSIDE THE 20 TO THE 16 YARD LINE. THE GUARDS GOT OUT TO PROVIDE THE CONVOY. KIRK: YOU HAVE THE BACK BACK HERE AND A TIGHT END, YOU HAVE SEVEN TO PROTECT AGAINST THAT AGGRESSIVE DOWNHILL DEFENSE. GOOD JOB PICKING UP IVAN PACE. YOU HAVE BLOCKERS DOWNFIELD AND A CONVOY. GOOD JOB PICKING UP POSITIVE YARDS. I LOVE HOW QUICK THE BALL IS GETTING OUT OF THE HANDS OF MATTHEW STAFFORD. AL: WILLIAMS. TRYING TO FIND A SPOT. A FLAG THROWN, OUR FIRST OF THE GAME. PRETTY OBVIOUS WHAT WENT ON. KIRK: YOU GOT THE FACEMASK, BEFORE HE EVEN WENT DOWN. AL: TWO OFFICIALS SAY, "WE GOT IT." REFEREE: PERSONAL FOUL, DEFENSE, NUMBER 0. HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL, AL: IVAN PACE. HE HAD A FUMBLE RETURN FOR A TOUCHDOWN SUNDAY AGAINST DETROIT. THAT MAKES IT A FIRST DOWN AND GOAL. SO FAR, TWO RUNS AND FOUR PASSES. THE RAMS TRYING TO ANSWER MINNESOTA'S OPENING SALVO. WILLIAMS. TWO THE 5. PACE MAKING THE TACKLE. SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. KIRK: THIS OPENING DRIVE BY THE RAMS, DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB. THE BALL IS GETTING OUT OF HIS HANDS. DIFFERENT LOOKS, FORMATIONS AND MOTIONS. THEY ARE GETTING OFFENSIVE LINEMEN IN SPACE AGAINST SMALL THEIR DEFENSIVE BACKS. THAT IS A GOOD THING WHEN YOU COULD GET THE BALL OUT. SECOND AND THIRD LEVEL, LINEMEN ARE RUNNING DOWNHILL. AL: KUPP IN MOTION. STAFFORD FIRES AND THAT IS INCOMPLETE. KUPP IS LOOKING FOR A FLAG, WILL NOT GET ONE. STEPHAN GILMORE. NOW A VIKING. KIRK: KUPP WILL GO IN MOTION FROM THE RIGHT TO THE LEFT. STAFFORD WORKS TO THE RIGHT, LOOK AT HIS HEAD, AND THEN COMES BACK. GREAT JOB OF PROTECTING BY THE OFFENSIVE LINE. IT LOOKED LIKE HE MIGHT HAVE GRABBED HOLD OF THE HIP. THAT IS WHAT THE CROWD IS REACTING TO. AL: ABSOLUTELY. SAW THE REPLAY. THIRD DOWN AND GOAL. IN THE POCKET, TOUCHDOWN, KYREN WILLIAMS! HIS SECOND RECEIVING TOUCHDOWN OF THE SEASON. KIRK: WHAT A CALL HERE. I HAPPEN TO BE WATCHING KYREN WILLIAMS LIVE. WATCH IVAN PACE THINK THE ROUTE IS COMING OUT HERE. WATCH HOW HE GETS HIMSELF OUT OF POSITION. RUNS OUT, PUTS HIS FOOT IN THE GROUND, EASY ONE-ON-ONE MATCHUP AND A GREAT WAY TO ATTACK THE INTERIOR OF THE VIKINGS DEFENSE WITH A BACK AGAINST A LINEBACKER TO POTENTIALLY TIE THIS ONE UP. AL: KARTY, A ROOKIE FROM STANFORD. THIS ONE IS GOOD. EACH TEAM WITH A STELLAR OPENING DRIVE ON THIS THURSDAY NIGHT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. 7-7. DO NOT SEE VERY MANY. GOT THE WHOLE THING GOING ON. T-MAN, OUR PRODUCER. MEANWHILE, ANOTHER TOUCHBACK. HE HAS ONLY ALLOWED ONE RUN BACK THIS YEAR, THE RAMS KICKER. KIRK: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR NEXGEN STATS. JUSTIN JEFFERSON. VERY INVOLVED IN THE OPENING DRIVE. 263 RECEIVING YARDS AND FOUR TOUCHDOWNS AGAINST MAN COVERAGE. THE OPENING DRIVE, RAMS TRYING TO KEEP HIM IN FRONT OF THEM AND THE VIKINGS DID A GOOD JOB OF HITTING THE INTERIOR ROUTES TO JEFFERSON. THEY WENT EIGHT PLAYS, 70 YARDS ON THE TOUCHDOWN DRIVE AND DID NOT HAVE ONE THIRD DOWN. AL: DARNOLD STARTS 4-4. THEY WRAP UP JONES AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. KAYLEE: AS SOON AS KEVIN O'CONNELL WALKED INTO THE VIKINGS FACILITY DAYS REMOVED FROM WINNING THE SUPER BOWL WITH THE RAMS, JUSTIN JEFFERSON TELLS ME HE ASKED HIM HOW DID COOPER KUPP GET SO OPEN? JEFFERSON BELIEVED HIS NEW HEAD COACH COULD GET HIM TO THAT LEVEL. THE MAIN THING OATMCONNELL TOLD HIM WAS TO LEARN EVERY RECEIVER AL: HE MAKES AS MANY SPECTACULAR CATCHES AS ANYBODY. AL: LOOKING THAT WAY. THE PASS IS THROWN TO THE OUTSIDE AND THAT TIME IT IS ADDISON MAKING THE GRAB APPEARED ADDISON PLAYED HIS COLLEGE BALL AT USC. KIRK: YOU MOVE HIM BACK HERE, HE ALMOST USE HIM AS A DECOY TO GET CARNELL LAKE IN THE FLAT. TWO DEFENDERS AND YOU GO OVER THE TOP TO ANOTHER GIFTED RECEIVER, JORDAN ADDISON. THAT IS AN AREA THAT THE UNSELFISH SIDE OF JEFFERSON. HE WILL GET BRACKETED OR DOUBLE-TEAMED AND THAT WILL OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE OTHER AL: JONES. IT IS NEVER BAD TO HAVE A NUMBER 2 RECEIVER, YOU HAVE AN ALPHA AND A BETA. IF THE BETA IS GOOD, THAT TAKES PRESSURE OFF THE ALPHA. KIRK: JORDAN ADDISON HAS TO LEARN OTHER POSITIONS. JALEN NAILOR HAS TO LEARN THAT. WHEN T.J. HOCKENSON COMES BACK. EVEN AARON JONES. WE TALKED ABOUT HIM COMING OVER FROM GREEN BAY. WEAPONS ON THIS VIKINGS OFFENSE AND A VETERAN OFFENSIVE LINE IN FOUR OF THE FIVE SPOTS. AL: HOCKENSON MIGHT BE READY TO COME BACK IN THE NEXT GAME. DARNOLD FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE TO THE 41. JEFFERSON HAVING A GREAT FIRST FOUR GRABS FOR HIM ALREADY. DARNOLD IS PERFECT, 5-5. KIRK: OMAR SPEIGHTS JUST LOST IN COVERAGE, IN FOR TROY REEDER. LOOK AT THAT. UNTIL THEY CORRECT THIS AND START TO SYNC A BIT OR CHANGE THE COVERAGE, JUST KEEP THROWING IT TO 18 OVER THE MIDDLE BECAUSE THE LINEBACKERS ARE NOT GETTING DEPTH. A GOOD JOB BY SAM DARNOLD THROWING IN RHYTHM. AL: DARNOLD BUYS TIME, ROLLS, WILL RUN IT AND SLIDES TO A STOP INSIDE THE 25-YARD LINE. WITH 3:48 AND TICKING DOWN UNTIL THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER, THE VIKINGS ARE ON THE MOVE AGAIN. KIRK: NEW YORK JETS FANS HAVE TO BE WATCHING SAM DARNOLD -- IF I NEED ANOTHER THING TO DRIVE ME CRAZY, I HAVE TO WATCH SAM DARNOLD IN PURPLE? CAROLINA FANS, WHAT IN THE HECK IS GOING ON WITH SAM DARNOLD? IT IS KEVIN O'CONNELL AND WES PHILLIPS HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB WORKING WITH HIM. AL: LOOK AT JONES BANGING HIS WAY TO THE 22-YARD LINE. IT IS INTERESTING WITH AARON JONES, AND HIS EIGHTH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE -- THEY WILL GO FAST HE HAS DONE SO MUCH DAMAGE TO THE VIKINGS OVER THE YEARS AS A PACKER, NOW HE IS ON THE OTHER SIDE. THIRD AND 1, DARNOLD TAKES IT HIMSELF. THE RAMS CITY DID NOT GET IT BUT THE OFFICIALS WILL MAKE THE JUDGMENT. AND THEY SIGNAL A FIRST DOWN. KIRK: IT IS CRAZY TO SEE AARON JONES AFTER ALL THOSE LAMBEAU LEAPS NOW WEARING PURPLE AND GOLD. YOU TALK ABOUT A DIFFERENCE MAKER IN THE BACKFIELD. YOU GET CAUGHT UP WITH JUSTIN JEFFERSON AND DOUBLING HIM AND YOU HAVE JORDAN ADDISON AND JALEN NAILOR. EVENTUALLY YOU GET T.J. HOCKENSON BACK. NOW INSTEAD OF A PHYSICAL BACK LIKE LAST YEAR WITH ALEXANDER MATTISON, NOW YOU HAVE AN ELECTRIC BACK WITH AARON JONES. AL: SHORT DROP, PASS TO THE OUTSIDE. AGAIN THAT IS JEFFERSON, MAKING HIS FIFTH CATCH. COBIE DURANT COVERING ON THE PLAY. DARNOLD IS 7-7 AND JEFFERSON HAS CAUGHT FIVE 468 ALREADY. KIRK: WHAT I WAS GOING -- AL: JEFFERSON HAS CAUGHT FIVE FOR 68 ALREADY. KIRK: HE HAS PLAYERS AROUND HIM AND COACHES THAT HAVE BUILD HIS CONFIDENCE UP. HE WAS THE THIRD PICK OVERALL. IT WAS A MATTER OF HIM SITTING IN IN THE RIGHT SYSTEM WITH THE RIGHT PLAYERS AROUND HIM AND HE HAS FOUND A HOME WITH MINNESOTA. AL: SECOND AND 5 OUT OF THE PISTOL, JONES AGAIN. NOT TOO MANY GUYS GO FROM GREEN BAY TO MINNESOTA. BRETT FAVRE DID IT BUT HE MADE A STOP IN NEW YORK. KIRK: THAT IS RIGHT. AL: CONNECTED. KIRK: [LAUGHTER] HOW ABOUT JONES? ANOTHER GUY WHO COMES OVER. HE UNDERSTOOD BEFORE HE SIGNED TO COME OVER TO MINNESOTA, JEFFERSON AND THESE RECEIVERS WILL GET A LOT OF ATTENTION. THAT IS NOT A BAD THING FOR ME AND THIS RUNNING GAME. BEFORE THAT PAY ATTENTION TO 18, THAT WILL OPEN RUNNING LANES FO ME. AL: FIRST AND GOAL, BALL SPOT IT AT THE 10. DARNOLD, GOOD PROTECTION, THAT IS CAUGHT BY SHERFIELD. TRENT SHERFIELD, FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. WHAT A START FOR THE VIKINGS. THEY ARE USED TO THAT, THE WAY THEY HAVE STARTED ALMOST EVERY FIRST QUARTER THIS SEASON. KIRK: IT IS ALMOST LIKE WATCHING A SEVEN ON SEVEN DRILL WITH THE WE DID NOT EVEN BRING UP SHERFIELD, 11, WHO JUST WORKS ACROSS. LINEBACKERS, EYES IN THE BACKFIELD, THEY DO NOT PICK HIM UP UNTIL LATE. EASY THROW IN RHYTHM FOR SAM DARNOLD. THAT COULD NOT HAVE GONE ANY BETTER FOR THE VIKINGS. AL: IS PERFECT SEASON CONTINUES, HE MAKES THE EXTRA POINT. FINAL MINUTE, FIRST QUARTER ON THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL. WHAT A START. MINNESOTA 14, L.A. 7. IT IN HIS FIFTH YEAR AS HEAD COACH. ANOTHER GUY ON SEAN MCVAY'S COACHING TREE. THE RAMS WENT ALL IN, GOT VON MILLER, TRADED FOR STAFFORD IT PAID OFF. THERE IS THE BANNER. THE KICK IS TAKEN THREE YARDS STAFFORD' STAFFORD'S NAME IS BEING THROWN OUT IN THE RUMOR MILL. IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT COOPER KUPP COULD GET TRADED. THERE IS A PREMIUM FOR WIDE RECEIVERS WITH THE TEAMS THAT NEED THEM. THE RAMS WOULD NEED SOMETHING REALLY GOOD. TONIGHT'S GAME WILL BE A BIG FACTOR WITH WHAT HAPPENS. KIRK: IF THEY ARE ABLE TO WIN THIS FOOTBALL GAME, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO MAKE A MOVE, SITTING AT 3-4? JUST LIKE LAST YEAR, WHEN THEY WON SEVEN OF THEIR LAST EIGHT. AL: IF THEY WIN TONIGHT, THEY WOULD BE 3-4 AND GOING TO SEATTLE. NACUA, AS OF MONDAY, PEOPLE SAID HE WOULD NOT PLAY. ALL OF THE SUDDEN, NOT ONLY IS HE PLAYING, HE HAS BEEN TARGETED FOUR TIMES, THREE CATCHES, 50 KIRK: THEY ARE ATTACKING THE INTERIOR OF THE SECOND LEVEL. THE LINEBACKER IS UPTIGHT, SIX GUYS COMING ON PRESSURE, THE BALL IS GETTING OUT OF HIS HAND ON THE LINE IS DOING A GREAT JOB SO FAR HELPING OUT MATTHEW STAFFORD AGAINST THE PASS RUSH. AL: PROTECTED WELL. REACHING BACK AND INCOMPLETE. COOPER KUPP TRIED TO REACH BACK FOR IT. PASS ERRANT. 10 SECONDS LEFT IN THE QUARTER. SECOND DOWN. KIRK: NEVER SECURED IT. AGAIN, ANOTHER QUICK BALL. THAT ONE JUST A LITTLE BIT BEHIND KUPP. ALL THE OPTION ROUTES HE HAS UNDERNEATH, HE CAN GO LEFT, CAN SET THE GOT UP AND GO RIGHT. THAT TIME I THINK DAY READ IT. THEY WERE ON THE SAME PACE BUT THAT WAS A RARE MISS FOR STAFFORD. YOU JUST ASSUME IT WILL BE ACCURATE EVERY THROW. AL: HE WAS A CATCHER IN HIGH SCHOOL AND HE CAUGHT CLAYTON KERSHAW. REFEREE: TIMEOUT. 30-SECOND TIMEOUT. AL: EVERYONE KNOWS THE STORY OF BASEBALL AND FOOTBALL, CLAYTON KIRK: HIGHLAND PARK OUT OF DALLAS, RIGHT? AL: WHAT A STORY THAT WILL BE WITH THE DODGERS.THE LAKE. KIRK: A LOT OF UNDERNEATH SHOTS. AT SOME POINT THEY WILL TRY TO SNEAK BEHIND THE COVERAGE. KIND OF SETTING THEM UP TO GET THE DOUBLE MOVE. AL: SECOND AND 10. GOES THE OTHER WAY. WILLIAMS SLIPS A TACKLE, SLIPS ANOTHER ONE AND MAKES A LITTLE SOMETHING OUT OF NOTHING AS TIME WINDS DOWN AND THE FIRST QUARTER IS OVER. END OF ONE. KAYLEE: JUSTIN JEFFERSON WITH 68 YARDS ON FIVE CATCHES. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO GET HIM GOING? KEVIN: FIRST AND FOREMOST I LIKE WHAT WE ARE DOING AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. GETTING THE RUN GAME GOING. JUSTIN IS FINDING SOME SPACE BECAUSE OF THAT. WE HAVE SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN OUR GUYS. SAM IS PLAYING GREAT. WE ARE OFF TO A GOOD START. KAYLEE: SEAN MCVAY HAS HIS OFFENSE HUMMING. HOW DO YOU SLOW THEM DOWN? KEVIN: WE KNOW SEAN WILL CALL A GREAT GAME. WE HAVE TO PLAY COMPLEMENTARY FOOTBALL AND GET OFF THE FIELD HERE ON A CRITICAL THIRD DOWN. AL: INDEED THEY GET OFF THE FIELD, BUT THERE IS A FLAG. THAT WAS A THIRD AND 7. REFEREE: HOLDING, DEFENSE, NUMBER 7. FIVE YARD PENALTY, AUTOMATIC AL: THEY GOT OFF THE FIELD BUT ONLY MOMENTARILY BECAUSE THE FLAG WAS ON BYRON MURPHY. KIRK: THE PLAY WENT EXACTLY THE WAY BRIAN FLORES WOULD WANT. THIRD AND 7 AND THEN BRING THE PRESSURE. THIS ENDS UP BEING THE HOLDING CALL ON MURPHY. I DID NOT SEE MUCH OF ANYTHING. IF IT WAS ON 7, THERE WAS NOT A HOLD THERE. AL: ROBINSON. MEANWHILE, GREAT MOVES BY I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, THIS KID DOES NOT GET A LOT OF ATTENTION. HE NEEDS TO START GETTING A LOT MORE. A BEAUTIFUL RUN. 18 YARDS. KIRK: HE BRINGS GREAT ENERGY. GREAT BLOCK AND THEN WATCH PUKA GET UP TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND SEAL THE EDGE. PUKA IS ABLE TO GET UP ON STEFON GILMORE. THIS GUY IS NOT LOOKING TO RUN OUT OF BOUNDS. HE WAS THE SAME WAY IN COLLEGE AT NOTRE DAME. THIS OFFENSIVE LINE FEEDS OFF OF THE RUN. AL: HE COMES OUT FOR THE MOMENT. CORUM, THE ROOKIE OUT OF MICHIGAN, WHO HAD A TREMENDOUS COLLEGE CAREER. SHORT AGAIN. KIRK: HE IS SIMILAR AS FAR AS PERSONALITY AND MAKEUP. IT DID NOT SURPRISE ME WHEN LES SNEAD DECIDED TO PULL THE TRIGGER. KYREN WILLIAMS ALREADY, 116 CARRIES COMING INTO TONIGHT. THAT IS A LOT. AS THE SEASON GOES ALONG, YOU WILL HAVE TO GIVE BLAKE CORUM MORE AND MORE CARRIES AND SEE WHAT HE CAN DO AS A ROOKIE. AL: HE PLAYED WITH J.J. MCCARTHY. THE PASS IS CAUGHT AND TO THE 14 YARD LINE, NACUA. WHAT A NIGHT. PICKING UP WHERE HE LEFT OFF LAST SEASON. KIRK: NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE ROOKIE. THEY WILL CHALLENGE HIM RIGHT AWAY. YOU HAVE TO PICK THAT UP AND HE JUST GETS ENOUGH OF IVAN PACE GIVE MATTHEW STAFFORD ENOUGH ROOM TO GET THAT BALL OUT. THE BEAUTIFUL HANDS OF NACUA TO PULL THAT ONE IN FOR THE FIRST GREAT LOOK AT THAT PASS PROTECTION. A BIG EMPHASIS THIS WEEK AGAINST THOSE LINEBACKERS. AL: WILLIAMS IS BACK IN. MEANWHILE, THE END AROUND, HERE COMES NACUA AGAIN, TO THE LINE. PUKA NACUA, FIFTH ROUND DRAFT CHOICE OUT OF BYU. EXPLODED ON THE SCENE LAST YEAR WITH THE RAMS. TREMENDOUS ROOKIE SEASON. KIRK: JUST TO REMIND PEOPLE, THIS GUY IS A BIG, BIG RECEIVER. HE IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL RECEIVER. BOTH HE AND COOPER KUPP, THEY ARE NOT THE GUY IN THE SLOT WHO HAS WIGGLE. THEY ARE BIG GUYS. HE HAS ACCELERATION. AL: SECOND AND 3. EIGHTS PLAY OF THE DRIVE. WILLIAMS GETS TAKEN DOWN. THE RAMS PICKED A GUY NAMED NACUA, YOU THINK HE WOULD BE 5'7". I AM WITH YOU. AL: HE IS A STUD. KIRK: KYREN WILLIAMS, MATTHEW STAFFORD, 16TH YEAR, 36 YEARS OLD, YOU BRING IN GUYS AROUND HIM. IT IS NICE TO SEE HOW THEY HAVE BROUGHT IN PIECES TO BRING THE ENERGY. NOW YOU HAVE A BIG THIRD DOWN FOR BRIAN FLORES AND THE VIKINGS DEFENSE. KYREN WILLIAMS BACK IN THE BACKFIELD NEXT TO STAFFORD. AL: COLBY PARKINSON, THE TIGHT END. THEY HAVE TRIPS TO THE RIGHT. NOW, A FLAG. IT LOOK LIKE JACKSON MOVED, THE LEFT TACKLE. REFEREE: FALSE START, OFFENSE, NUMBER 77. FIVE YARD PENALTY. KIRK: IF IT WASN'T GOING TO BE A FALSE START BY JACKSON, IT IS HARD TO STAY IN THERE ON THIRD AND SHORT, IT WAS GOING TO BE A DELAY OF GAME. YOU SEE STAFFORD TRYING TO HURRY OUT. YOU HAVE A ROOKIE CENTER. A LITTLE MISCOMMUNICATION PUSHES THEM BACK ON THIRD AND 7. AL: THEY HAVE ALREADY USED TWO TIMEOUTS BECAUSE OF THE PLAY CLOCK ALREADY. THIRD DOWN AND 7. TRIPS TO THE RIGHT. STAFFORD LOOKS THAT WAY. IT IS INCOMPLETE. KUPP WAS COVERED, BUT YET ANOTHER FLAG. THEY GET A BREAK ON AN EARLIER FLAG, GILMORE WAS THERE WITH KUPP. KIRK: I THINK GILMORE GOT OUT OF POSITION AND HAD TO PLAY CATCH-UP. HE GOT OUT-FLANKED FROM THE BUNCH LOOK. THEY WENT TO A THREE-RECEIVER LOOK SO GILMORE HAS TO TRY TO WORK THROUGH SOME TRAFFIC AND NOW IT IS A FOOT RACE. THE BALL BEING UNDERTHROWN MAKES GILMORE RUN INTO COOPER KUPP. GOOD CONFUSION WITH THAT PRE-SNAP MOTION. SLOWED GILMORE, A LITTLE HESITANT, TO ALLOW COOPER KUPP TO GET OUTSIDE. AL: FIRST AND GOAL. RAMS OUT OF A TIGHT FORMATION. TAKEN DOWN IN THE BACKFIELD, THAT WAS PACE COMING THROUGH. IVAN PACE. SECOND YEAR OUT OF CINCINNATI. KNOX DOWN WILLIAMS. IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. KIRK: THIS IS WHAT HE IS KNOWN FOR. YOU SEE METELLUS. BOTH OF THE BACKERS ARE PROTECTING. THE AMOUNT OF BIG BODIES THEY HAVE UPFRONT. EASY TACKLE THAT TIME FOR PACE. AL: VIKINGS MINUS BLAKE CASHMAN TONIGHT. HE LEADS THE TEAM IN TACKLES. STAFFORD CHASED, ESCAPES, FIRES, CAUGHT, TOUCHDOWN. COOPER KUPP. KIRK: ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!? 36 YEARS OLD. HE IS A GREAT ATHLETE. WHAT A JOB, THE RAMS ANSWERING SAM DARNOLD. WATCH THIS BEEN MOVE BY BERNARD. HE HAS A CHANCE FOR THE SACK. THE BIG FELLA, HARRISON PHILLIPS. I KNOW STAFFORD WILL FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT. HE GETS OUT AND HAS THE VISION DOWNFIELD TO FIND HIS MAIN GUY, 10, KUPP. AL: JOSHUA KARTY FOR THE POINT AFTER. AND WITH 10:05 TO GO IN THE FIRST HALF, WE HAVE A TRACK MEET. KIRK: FOUR DRIVES, AL: WE LOVE L.A. BLACK FRIDAY FOOTBALL ON PRIME. WE WILL BE IN KANSAS CITY THE DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING AS THE RAIDERS AND THE CHIEFS. ON BLACK FRIDAY. THOSE TWO TEAMS WILL MEET ON SUNDAY IN LAS VEGAS. ONE OF THEIR TWO MEETINGS THIS SEASON. 28 POINTS ON THE BOARD. THE RAMS TO KICK OFF. ETHAN EVANS. DOES IT AGAIN. KAYLEE: JUST FORLD GAVE HIM THE NOD TO COME OVER. THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION OF TECHNIQUE. DONALD CALMED THE ROOKIE'S NERVES. SAID IT IS JUST FOOTBALL, DON'T LET IT GO TO YOUR HEAD. AL: TY CHANDLER IS NOW THE RUNNING BACK. NUMBER 32, AARON JONES, RESTING FOR THE MOMENT. MOTION, AND WE HAVE A FLAG. KIRK: EVERYBODY MOVING ON THE BALL DID NOT COME UP FROM BRADBURY, THE CENTER. NUMBER 64. FIVE YARD PENALTY, STILL FIRST KIRK: THE EXECUTED SO FLAWLESSLY THE FIRST TWO DRIVES. HOW ABOUT SAM DARNOLD IN THE FIRST QUARTER THIS SEASON? 81% OF HIS PASSES, 418, SIX TOUCHDOWNS, NO INTERCEPTIONS, A 143 QB RATING. AL: THE VIKINGS OFFENSIVE LINE HAS STAYED HEALTHY, SANE FIVE STARTERS EVERY GAME. THEY HAVE MISSED ONLY NINE SNAPS. KIRK: I DON'T THINK THE VIKINGS HAD THE RIGHT FORMATION. REFEREE: ILLEGAL FORMATION, OFFENSE. KIRK: DEJA VU. AN AREA THEY WANTED TO CLEAN UP. REFEREE: CORRECTION, THE PENALTY WILL BE DECLINED. AL: THE RAMS WILL TAKE THE PLAY AND MAKE IT SECOND DOWN AND 15 INSTEAD OF FIRST AND 20. MEANWHILE, KAM CURL, WHO GOT HURT EARLIER, IS NOW BACK AT SAFETY. SECOND AND 15. JJ IN MOTION. GETS A BLOCK. UP TO THE 31-YARD LINE, TACKLED BY JAYLEN MCCOLLOUGH. KIRK: GIVES THEM A SHOT ON THIRD INTERESTING THE RAMS LET THE SECOND PENALTY GO. NOW WE HAVE THIRD DOWN. SEE IF THEY CAN DIAL UP SOME THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT. EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE BLITZED, DARNOLD HAS BEEN UNTOUCHED, VERY CLEAN POCKET. THEY HAVE GOOD PASS RUSHERS. SEE IF THEY CAN GET AFTER HIM. AL: THIRD AND 9. LOOK OUT FROM BEHIND. DARNOLD FEELS IT, STEPS FORWARD BUT THE THROW IS LOW AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE GAME, WE HAVE A FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: VERSE DOES A GOOD JOB FROM BEHIND HERE. THE PUSH IN THE INTERIOR FROM MICHAEL HOECHT AFFECTED HIM. FINALLY, WE SEE A DEFENSE GET THE OPPOSING FIELD. AL: FIRST PUNT OF THE NIGHT. RYAN WRIGHT. XAVIER SMITH SETS UP INSIDE HIS 25. DRIFTS OVER TO THE FAR SIDE. GOOD KICK. FIELDED OUT THE 9. NO ROOM TO ROAM. TACKLED AT THE 13. NORMALLY VEGGIES, BABY, NO VEGGIES. YOU KNOW WHO ELSE DOES NOT EAT VEGGIES? PUKA NACUA. KIRK: THAT IS WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO FIND HIM ON THE FIELD BEFORE THE GAME. AL: ANDREW WHITWORTH. A GAIN OF A COUPLE FROM BLAKE CORUM, STARTING ON THIS DRIVE. UNDER NINE MINUTES TO PLAY. GAME TIED AT 14-14. KIRK: WE SAW THE DEFENSE OF THE RAMS MAKING ADJUSTMENTS, HELPING TO GET THE VIKINGS TO MAKE MISTAKES. AFTER A GREAT PUNT, LET'S SEE IF THIS VIKINGS DEFENSE CAN COME UP WITH SOME ANSWERS. THEY HAVE STAFFORD AND THE RAMS PINNED. WE ARE WATCHING TWO OF THE BEST PLAY CALLERS GO AT IT TONIGHT. AL: FLAG. REFEREE: PRIOR TO THE SNAP, FALSE START, OFFENSE, NUMBER 50. FIVE YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN. KIRK: THAT IS BEAUX LIMMER, THE ROOKIE CENTER. AL: JUST A FLINCH BY THE CENTER. CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING IN A ROOKIE IN A GAME LIKE THIS AGAINST THIS DEFENSE? HE IS WORRIED ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS. PROTECTION, SLIDING RIGHT, SLIDING LEFT. HE JUST MOVES A LITTLE BIT. THAT PUSHES THE RAMS BACK EVEN FURTHER. AL: KUPP. WITH BLOCKING. HE GETS OUT TO ABOUT THE 13-YARD HE GOT A BLOCK FROM COLBY PARKINSON. THE RAMS NOW WITH A THIRD DOWN AND 9. WITHOUT A HUDDLE. THREE-MAN RUSH. STAFFORD, LOOK OUT. AVOIDS THE SAFETY. REFEREE: THERE IS NO FOUL FOR INTENTIONAL GROUNDING, THERE WAS AN ELIGIBLE RECEIVER IN THE AREA. AL: HE STARTED TO STUMBLE. REFEREE: ILLEGAL HANDS TO THE FACE, DEFENSE, NUMBER 52. AL: WHOA. REFEREE: FIVE YARD PENALTY, AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. AL: THAT IS THE THIRD TIME THE RAMS HAVE FAILED ON THIRD DOWN AND THE VIKINGS HANDED THEM A GIFT. KIRK: WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE CENTER. HE GETS A DOUBLE TEAM AND THE LEFT-HAND GETS UP INTO THE FACE. FIRST YOU HEARD HIM SAY THERE WAS NO FOUL FOR INTENTIONAL GROUNDING. THERE IS A GREAT LOOK AT THE HAND IT TO THE FACE OF THE YOU ARE RIGHT, THE RAMS CATCH A BREAK. AL: THREE TIMES. HALFWAY THROUGH THE QUARTER. FROM THE 17. CORUM IS THE RUNNING BACK. GIVE IT TO THE MICHIGAN ROOKIE. UP TO THE 22-YARD LINE HE GOES. KIRK: THIS KID TACKLES. HE IS 5' HE IS 5'8", ABOUT 210 POUNDS. HE COMPLEMENTS KYREN WILLIAMS. LOOKING TO PROVE HIMSELF AND RUN WITH A GREAT DEAL OF ENERGY AND PASSION ANYTIME HE GETS A CHANCE. WE ALREADY SAW THE PASS PRO HE HAD EARLIER THAT HELPED STAFFORD MOVEMENT AGAIN, THIS TIME ON THE RIGHT SIDE. IT LOOKED LIKE 87. NUMBER 79. FIVE YARD PENALTY, STILL SECOND AL: THEY CALL THAT ON THE TACKLE, HAVENSTEIN. KIRK: EVERYTHING HAS BEEN SO FLAWLESS FOR BOTH OF THESE OFFENSES. AND THEN THIRD TIME, FOR BOTH SIDES, MAKING MISTAKES. AL: HARD TO KEEP UP THAT PACE. YEAH, NO DOUBT. AL: KYREN WILLIAMS IS BACK ON SECOND AND 10. HE GETS IT. LOOKS FOR ROOM. THREADS HIS WAY TO A GAIN OF 8 -- AND ANOTHER FLAG. AFTER A MOSTLY FLAG-FREE FIRST QUARTER, A TON HERE IN THE SECOND. REFEREE: HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER 50. 10-YARD PENALTY, SECOND DOWN. AL: THAT IS BEAUX LIMMER AGAIN. A TOUGH NIGHT FOR HIM. THEY ARE MINUS TWO STARTING LINEMEN. THE ROOKIE IN AT CENTER HAVING A TOUGH ONE. KIRK: THE BACK SIDE DOES SUCH A GOOD JOB ON THE ZONE PLAY. RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE IS THE HOLD AGAINST PACE WITH LIMMER. LOOK AT THAT HOLE OPEN UP ON THE BACKSIDE. GREAT VISION. AL: SECOND AND 20. TRYING TO SET UP A SCREEN BUT NOTHING HAPPENING HERE. BUSTING THAT PLAY UP IS VAN GINKEL. KYREN WILLIAMS MADE THE CATCH. VAN GINKEL CAME OVER FROM THE DOLPHINS. KIRK: I TALKED TO HIM ON THE FIELD BEFORE THE GAME ABOUT WISCONSIN. HE WAS A GREAT PLAYER. I ASKED, DID YOU PLAYOFF BALL BACKER IN COLLEGE? HE SAID I DID NOT REALLY. HE SAID I AM ENJOYING THE OPPORTUNITY. AL: THIRD AND 18. WILLIAMS TAKES IT OUT TO THE 22. THEY WILL BRING IN THE PUNT GROUP FOR THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT WITH A LITTLE LESS THAN 5:30 TO GO IN THE HALF. KIRK: BOTH OFFENSES AFTER TOUCHDOWNS ON THEIR FIRST TWO DRIVES SELF-DESTRUCTIVE BIT AND CAUSE THEM TO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUSTAIN DRIVES. THE DEFENSES FINALLY GET STOPS. AL: ETHAN EVANS SENDS IT DOWN TOWARD BRANDON POWELL. POWELL CATCHES IT AT THE 36. AND RUNS IT BACK OUT TO THE 44-YARD LINE. RAMSAL: FOUR DIFFERENT TEAMS BEF TURNING 28. THREE TEAMS IN THREE YEARS. LAST YEAR AT SAN FRANCISCO, BACKING UP PURDY. IT WAS A FREE AGENT, LOOK AROUND AND FELT THAT MINNESOTA WAS THE RIGHT FIT. FROM THE 42. GOOD PLAY FAKE. PROTECTION BREAKS DOWN AND TACKLED, THAT IS VERSE WITH THE SACK AT THE 30-YARD LINE. KIRK: WHAT AN IMPRESSIVE ROOKIE YEAR THAT JARED VERSE IS ENJOYING. YOU KNEW IT WAS A MATTER OF TIME. THIS WAS UP AGAINST THE TIDE DAN, JOSH OLIVER. HE HAS 32 PRESSURES, 15TH IN THE NFL AS A ROOKIE. YOU KNEW ME EVENTUALLY HE WOULD GET HOME AND COME UP WITH PLAYS LIKE THIS. IT IS MORE OF A BULL RUSH, POWER. HE HAS TWITCH BUT THIS WAS MORE ABOUT OVERPOWERING THE MAN ACROSS FROM HIM. KIRK: ANOTHER PRE-SNAP PENALTY. NUMBER 71. FIVE YARD PENALTY, SECOND DOWN. AL: HOW ABOUT HAVING THE AWARENESS TO SAY, WAIT A SECOND -- I AM PLAYING IN A STADIUM OR A LOT OF TIMES THE VISITING FANS OVERWHELM THE HOME FANS -- NOT NECESSARILY TONIGHT -- BUT GIVING THE SIGN FOR THE "SKOL." KIRK: THIS IS OUR HOUSE, I DON'T NEED TO SEE THAT. AL: SECOND DOWN AND 25. LOOK OUT AGAIN! AVOIDS THE SACK, CHASED AND FIRES THAT ONE AWAY, INCOMPLETE. BYRON YOUNG WAS CHASING HIM. THIRD AND 25. KIRK: THEY USE FISKE, ANOTHER ROOKIE OUT OF FLORIDA STATE. YOUNG WILL WORK UNDERNEATH. THE LEFT GUARD, BRANDEL. ZERO ON ONE SIDE, EIGHT ON THE OTHER. THOSE TWO ARE REALLY DANGEROUS OFF THE EDGE FOR THIS RAMS KIRK: 3 -- AL: 3:30 UNTIL HALFTIME. RUSH THREE, DROP EIGHT. 35-YARD LINE. JALEN NAILOR, HIS FIRST CATCH OF THE NIGHT. FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: BACK TO WHAT CHRIS SHULA TOLD US ABOUT DEFENDING THIS WE HAVE TO GET NEGATIVE PLAYS. WE HAVE TO GET THEM BEHIND THE STICKS. WITH THE SNAP AND PENALTY, SECOND STRAIGHT SERIES THEY GOT THEM BEHIND THE STICKS AND GOT THEM OFF THE FIELD. AL: RYAN WRIGHT'S SECOND KICK. AL: SOFI STADIUM IN INGLEWOOD ON THIS THURSDAY NIGHT. EACH TEAM SCORING ON ITS FIRST TWO DRIVES AND NOW NOTHING BUT A SLOWED DOWN GAME AND PONCE. THE RAMS WILL BEGIN THIS DRIVE FROM THEIR OWN 11-YARD LINE. OUT OF A TIGHT FORMATION. MCVEIGH IS GREAT. HE IS AN OFFENSIVE GENIUS. THEY USE MORE TIGHT FORMATIONS THAN ANY OTHER TEAM IN THE LEAGUE. KIRK: HE IS REALLY THE GUY WHO HAS MADE IT A TREND. GOING BACK SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AGO. SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE COPIED THAT. IT HELPS YOU IN THE RUNNING GAME AS MUCH AS ANYTHING. IF YOU HAVE RECEIVERS WHO CAN SET THE EDGE. IT CREATES SPACE OUTSIDE OF THE PERIMETER FOR THE RECEIVERS TO WORK ON THE SECOND LEVEL ROUTES. AL: SECOND AND 6. THROWS TO PARKINSON, HIS TIGHT COLBY PARKINSON, OUT OF A TIMEOUT TAKEN -- ACTUALLY, IT IS THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING. AL: OUR OWN 55, ANDREW WHITWORTH, THERE HE IS, HOW ABOUT ENDING YOUR CAREER HERE IN THE SUPER BOWL WITH A VICTORY. KIRK: MASSIVE. AL: THAT MAN WILL BE IN THE HALL OF FAME SOMEDAY. NO QUESTION IN MY MIND. FROM THE 23 YARD LINE. WILLIAMS, ONE FOR 12 AFTER THE 35. THE RAMS, BECAUSE THEY USE TWO TIMEOUTS, HAVE ONLY ONE IN THE FINAL TWO MINUTES HERE. KIRK: ONE OF THE BIG STORIES THIS FIRST HALF IS STAFFORD. WHIT WOULD BE PROUD OF WHAT HE'S SEEN FROM THIS OFFENSE ALONE, ESPECIALLY THOSE TWO ROOKIES. AL: OUT OF THE POCKET, LOOKS FOR WILLIAMS, UNDER HANDS IT, LITTLE SHOVEL TOSS. PICKS UP A FEW. SECOND DOWN AND 4, GAIN OF SIX. KIRK: NICE LITTLE TOUCH THERE. MOST IMPORTANT THING, THEY ARE ABLE TO GET OUT OF BOUNDS, SHOWING THAT MOBILITY. AVOIDED THAT RASH. -- RUSH. FLIPPING IT DOWN THE FIELD. AL: HE KNOWS THE BLITZ IS COMING WITH THE BLITZ IS COMING WITH PACE RIGHT HERE. ONE OF THEM COMES, FINDS HIS WAY , AND THAT IS ENOUGH FOR A FIRST THE CLOCK IS RUNNING, ONE TIMEOUT FOR THE RAMS REMAINS. KIRK: AS MUCH AS THIS MINNESOTA DEFENSE BLUFFS, THEY SHOW IT, THEY BACK OUT, GOOD JOB OF USING THAT HARD COUNT TO TRY TO GET THEM TO TIP THEIR HAND AND GET AN INDICATOR. AL: ON THE OUTSIDE. CAUGHT AT THE 50 YARD LINE. KUPP, FLAG IS THROWN WITH 53 SECONDS. IF IT STANDS, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS THIRD CATCH TONIGHT. NACUA HAS BEEN THE BIG GUY. KIRK: JACKSON, 77, THREW WATCH HIM THROW HIM DOWN. WATCH THE FOLLOW THROUGH ON 77'S ARMS, THAT IS PROBABLY WHY THEY SAID HE WAS BLOCKING TO HIM. AL: SECOND AND 6, KUPP EN GILMORE, WHO HAS DONE THAT A LOT AND HIS 13 YEAR CAREER, KNOCKS YOU DOWN, THIRD AND 6. KIRK: T IS SITTING BACK, HE KNOWS WHETHER IT IS 17 AND 10, THIS TIME IT IS COOPER KUPP A LOT OF UNDERNEATH THROWS. MOST OF WHAT STAFFORD HAS THROWN HER GETTING OUT OF HIS HANDS -- HAS THROWN. GETTING IT OUT OF HIS HANDS QUICKLY. AL: STAFFORD, AND THAT IS KNOCKED DOWN. BERNARD, CAME OVER AS A FREE AGENT FROM THE TEXANS. KIRK: THERE IS FLORES AGAIN, SHOWS PRESSURE AGAIN, JUST RUSHERS THREE, DROPS EIGHT. EVERYBODY IS DOWNFIELD. EVEN IF HE MAKES THIS CATCH AND THAT BALL GETS OVER BERNARD, THERE ARE TWO DEFENDERS RIGHT THERE, AND HE WOULD NOT HAVE EVEN GOTTEN BACK TO THE LINE OF AL: ETHAN EVANS. TRYING TO DROP IT SHORT OF THE GOAL LINE. PUT SOME BACKSPIN. THEY LET IT BOUNCE, AND PERFECT. DOWN TO THE FIVE YARD LINE. THE VACCINES -- THE VIKINGS HAVE IT FOR 35 SECONDS, ANOTHER FLAG DOWN AT THE 44 YARD LINE OF THE >> DURING THE KICK, HOLDING, RECEIVING TEAM. AL: THAT BACKS THEM UP EVEN FARTHER NOW. THEY HAVE ALL THREE TIMEOUTS BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH 35 SECONDS? KIRK: FOUR OPENING DRIVES IN THIS GAME, TOUCHDOWNS, GOT A LITTLE SLOPPY. EVEN WITH THE TIMEOUTS. THIS IS WHERE YOU FIRST GET OUT OF HERE IN MY OPINION. YOU WOULD THINK, MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS. AL: EVERY TIME WE SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT, IT HAPPENS. I'M THINKING LIKE 97 YARDS. AS YOU WOULD FIGURE, THAT IS JONES. AND THEY SHOULD LET THE CLOCK -- KIRK: WE HAVE A GUY DOWN. AL: THAT WILL STOP THE CLOCK FOR AN INJURY. THAT IS THEIR BEST LINEMAN, LEFT TACKLE. KIRK: JONES, AS HE GOT TO FOOTBALL, HE MAY HAVE CUT AND THE DEFENDER MAY BE ROLLED UP ON DARRELL SCHALL, COMING FROM OUR RIGHT. YOU SEE THE LOWER LEFT LEG. AL: THREE INTERCEPTIONS, THE ROOKIE FREE AGENT, AND THAT IS WHY DARRISAW IS GOING TO NEED THE ATTENTION, AND HE IS STILL DOWN IN THE END ZONE. OH MAN. AL: DARRISAW GOT UP AND NEEDS TO BE ASSISTED BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM. THE LEFT TACKLE. I'M TALKING ABOUT HIM THE OTHER DAY, WHAT A GREAT JOB HE HAS DONE, AND OFFENSIVE LINE, TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE, EVERY GAME, THEY HAVE STARTED EVERY GAME THIS SEASON. NINE SNAPS COLLECTIVELY, BUT NOW DAVID CLOSE AND VERY -- BUT NOW DAVID, THAT IS A HECKUVA WAY TO LOSE YOU LEFT TACKLE TRYING TO RUN A CLOCK OUT. CAN KNEEL DOWN HERE WILL TAKE US -- THE KNEEL DOWN HERE WILL TAKE US TO HALFTIME. A SPIRITED BEGINNING TO THE HALF, SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT TOWARD THE LATTER STAGES, BUT IT WILL BE THE HALFTIMEACK TO START QUARTER, THE FIRST FOUR DRIVES IN THIS GAME, IT WAS A TRACK MEET, FOUR TOUCHDOWNS, 21, LAST FIVE DRIVES, ONLY THREE FIRST. IN THE FIRST SIX SEASONS, NO GAMES WITH TWO TD PASSES, HE HAS HAD THREE. STAFFORD THIS YEAR, ONLTHREE TOUCHDOWN PASSES, TONIGHT, PUKA NACUA PUKA NACUA TWO, AND HE GETS COOPER KUPP BACK, BACK, HE HAS 13 OF 18, AND HERE WE GO WITH THE THIRD QUARTER. KIRK: IT WAS GREAT TO SEE BOTH OF THESE QUARTERBACKS WITH RHYTHMS AND PLAY CALLERS, SAM DARNOLD AND SEAN MCVAY, WHAT HE CAN DO AS GOOD AS ANYBODY IN THE LEAGUE, AND NOW THAT HE HAS HIS WEAPONS BACK WITH MATTHEW STAFFORD, HE REALLY SAW THE RHYTHM OF BOTH OFFENSES AND WHAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF DOING. I'M SURE THEY WILL MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AFTER THE WAY THE FIRST HALF ENDED UP, AND THEN GET BACK TO WORK. AL: RAMS AT THE SECOND HALF KICKOFF, AND WILL START AT THE 30. MOMENTS AGO, KAYLEE WAS ON THE FIELD WITH SEAN MCVAY. KAYLEE: DESCRIBE THE IMPACT COOPER KUPP AND PUKA NACUA HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE COMING BACK? >> THEY HAVE BEEN HUGE. I LIKE WHAT THEY' I LIKE WHAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO. WE HAD A COUPLE OF DRIVES WHERE THEY STALLED BECAUSE OF PENALTIES ARE GREAT DEFENSE, BUT SECOND HALF, HERE WE GO. KAYLEE: THE VIKINGS SCORED TWO TOUCHDOWNS, AND THEN YOU HELD THEM. >> WE HAVE GOT TO KEEP GOING DEFENSIVELY, AND THEN WE HAVE TO GET A LITTLE MORE MOMENTUM TO FINISH THE SHOW OFFENSIVELY. AL: STARTING FROM THE 30 YARD LINE, AND, YOU KNOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE, IN MINNESOTA, THEY ARE IN GOOD SHAPE, BUT THEY ARE IN THE TOUGHEST DIVISION, 17-4. FOR THE RAMS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO AND FIVE, AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IS HUGE. KIRK: ESPECIALLY WILLIAMS, WITH THE CIRCULATION OF THE POSSIBILITY OF GUYS POTENTIALLY MOVING. YOU CAN GET THAT MANY BY, AND, YOU ARE RIGHT, BOTH TEAMS NEED A WIN. AL: SECOND AND 6, AND PUKA NACUA IS SOMEHOW NOT ABLE TO CATCH IT, EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS ABLE TO WORK HIS WAY AROUND. WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN AMAZING CATCH. LATE FLAG, BY THE WAY. KIRK: WHAT AN EFFORT TO COME BACK TO THAT, BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BACK IN, HOLDING. I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO DO IT AGAIN, HE IS FUN TO WATCH. NEVER KNOW WHAT HE IS CAPABLE OF DOING. VIKINGS DIALING UP PRESSURE, AND EVEN THOUGH THEY DID NOT GET HOME, THEY FORCED THE OFFENSIVE AND YOU HAVE A VIKINGS DEFENSE THAT CAN DIAL UP AS MUCH PRESSURE AS ANYBODY IN THE AL: SECOND DOWN AND 16. AFTER THE PENALTY FROM THE 24 YARD LINE. TARON WILLIAMS. -- THAT ALSO INCLUDES A TOUCHDOWN PASS. KIRK: THIS IS WHERE THEY LIKE TO GET BACK TO IT VAN GINKEL, TRY TO SEE THEY CAN DIAL IT UP AND GET SOME TO STAFFORD, GET THAT BALL OUT OF HIS HANDS QUICKLY. THEY WILL SHOW PRESSURE LIKE THEY ALWAYS DO ON THIRD DOWN. 22 IS OFF TO THE RIGHT. SMITH. AL: EXTRA MAN COMES. STAFFORD THROWS. PUKA NACUA, ALONG THE SIDELINE, PULLS IT IN. AGAIN, GILMORE COVERING. I TELL YOU WHAT, FOR A GUY WHO HAS BEEN HURT, WHO HAS NOT PRACTICED, WHAT A NIGHT. KIRK: LET'S GIVE STAFFORD A LOT OF CREDIT FOR THE TIMING OF THAT BALL. HE ANTICIPATES, A TOUGH THING TO DO ON THIRD DOWN. GREAT FOOTWORK THERE. POSSESSES THE FOOTBALL. A GREAT CATCH, BUT STAFFORD THROWING THE BALL EARLY GAVE HIM THAT CHANCE TO GET THOSE FEET AL: SIX CATCHES, 87 YARDS. KIRK: AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHEN YOU HAVE A GOOD NIGHT OFFENSIVELY, IT IS OBVIOUSLY PLAYERS LIKE NACUA AND COOPER KUPP COMING BACK, BUT THOSE CONVERSIONS ON THIRD DOWN, THEY HAD A HARD TIME LAST WEEK FOR YOU THEY ARE TWO OF 10, AND BY BEING ABLE TO COME UP WITH THAT FIRST DOWN CONVERSION, NOW YOU GET BACK ACROSS, START TO RUN THE FOOTBALL, THEY TRIED THAT DOUBLE MOVE, AND IT IS NOT THROWING THE BALL DOWNFIELD MUCH, BUT YOU KNOW IT IS COMING. OFF THE FAKE, GOING DEEP. TOO DEEP. YOU HAVE HARRIS AND SMITH, HAS HAD A STELLAR CAREER, HIS 13TH YEAR, NUMBER ONE PICK YEARS AGO OUT OF NOTRE DAME, THIRD AND 6. KIRK: I PERSONALLY LOVE WHAT MCVAY DOES HERE, HE GETS THE BALL THROWN DOWNFIELD, SO HARRISON, SMITH, ALL THOSE WHO HAVE NOT HAD TO REALLY WORRY ABOUT THE BALL GOING OVER THEIR HEADS AT ALL TONIGHT, IF NOTHING ELSE, IT REMINDS THEM ABOUT STAFFORD, AND THAT CAN OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES. AL: KUPP MOVING. THE THROW, AND IT WILL BE PICKED UP ALONG THE SIDELINE. MURPHY WITH THE INTERCEPTION. OVERTHROWN, AND MURPHY IS ABLE TO CORRAL IT AND STAY IN BOUNDS WITH IT. THREE MINUTES IN TO THE THIRD. MINNESOTA WITH THE BALL. THE GAME IS LOCKED AT 14-14. MEANWHILE, MURPHY WITH THE PICK, 12 INTERCEPTIONS NOW FOR THE VIKINGS, TOP AND THE LEAGUE, SECOND FOR MURPHY THIS YEAR. AND A RUN BY JONES. LINUS, THEIR BIG LEFT GO TO KAYLEE. KAYLEE: CHRISTIAN DARRISAW WILL NOT RETURN TO THE GAME, AND HE HAS NOT EVEN RETURN TO THE VIKINGS SIDELINE. HE TOOK THAT SHOT TO THE OUTSIDE OF HIS LEFT KNEE, AND TRAINERS ARE FOCUSING ON STABILITY OF THE KNEE WHEN THEY EVALUATED HIM AND YOU SAW HIM PUT LITTLE WEIGHTS, SO HE IS OUT. IN THE LEAGUE, DAVID QUESSENBERRY TAKES HIS SPOT. AND TRIPPED UP AT THE 43 YARD KIRK: YOU GOT THE 12 PERSON NOWLAND WITH TWO TIGHT ENDS. THE PLAY ACTION, WATCH HOW THEY GET OUT. THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL SHOTS DOWNFIELD. IT IS WITH THE VIKINGS LIKE TO DO WITH THE PLAY-ACTION, TAKE SHOTS. WITH A COMPLEMENT AND WHAT YOU HAVE TO RESPECT IS NOT JUST THE RUNNING GAME. AL: AGAIN, JONES, SECOND AND 8. KIRK: NOBODY IS EVER GOING TO BE AARON DONALD, WE KNOW THAT, BUT KOBIE TURNER, WHO HAD A GREAT ROOKIE YEAR OUT OF WAKE FOREST, HE HAS MOVED OUT TO THAT TACKLE SPOT AND HE HAS SOME TWITCH, HE HAS SOME QUICKNESS. SO THAT TIME, HE MADE A GREAT PLAY, AND HE NEEDED TO GET THE BACKFIELD. AL: TRYING TO FIGHT FOR IT. LET'S SEE IF HE GOT IT OR NOT, THAT IS JORDAN. KIRK: HOW ABOUT THAT FOR A FIRST DOWN? ADDISON, AGAIN AND ENDED UP TRANSFERRING TO USC, KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING, GOT HIM. THIS IS AN EFFORT TEAM. BOTH SIDES OF THE FOOTBALL. AL: YOU CANNOT GET A BETTER VIEW. KIRK: THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL. AL: FROM THE 47. JEFFERSON, WHO IS BLAZING HOT THAT FIRST HALF, HE HAS ALREADY CAUGHT 60 OF 74, BUT HE HAS BEEN QUIET THE LAST QUARTER PLUS. KIRK: YOU ARE RIGHT, THE WAY THIS GAME STARTED, DETERMINED TO GET HIM GOING EARLY. JUST AS YOU SAY THAT, YOU KNOW IT IS A MATTER OF TIME, LIKE LAST AGAINST THE LIONS. THEY MADE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO GET HIM MORE INVOLVED, AND THEY DID. IT HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THE COME AL: ONLY SIX YARDS SINCE, SECOND AND EIGHT. DONALD AVOIDS -- DARNOLD AVOIDS THE SACK. YOU COULD HAVE PREDICTED THAT. KIRK: THE LEFT GUARD MAKES A CRITICAL BLOCK. WATCH THIS. I THOUGHT THE PRESSURE MIGHT GET TO HIM. HE GOES INSIDE, OUTSIDE, AND THEN HE JUST MOVES HIS HAND ON SAM DARNOLD, BUT THIS IS WHERE JEFFERSON HAD MOST OF HIS OPPORTUNITIES, OVER THE MIDDLE OF THAT DEFENSE, BEHIND THE LINEBACKERS, GETTING LOST A LITTLE BIT IN COVERAGE. AL: DONALD -- DARNOLD, IN THE CORNER, HE IS JUGGLING, AND THEY ARE GOING TO SAY HE DID CATCH VIKINGS ARE GOING TO RACE OFF THE LINE BEFORE THE RAMS CAN GET SET, BEFORE THEY CAN CHALLENGE THIS. KIRK: LET'S SEE. AL: IS IT WORTH A CHALLENGE? WILL MCVAY THROW THE FLAG? TOO LATE. TAKEN DOWN. JONES WAS TAKEN DOWN. KIRK: I THINK HE ENDED UP CATCHING IT AT THE END. HOW ABOUT THE NONCHALANCE TO GET IT STARTED? NO PROBLEM. NOW HE HAS GOT IT. GIVING US THE CATCH SIGN. HE BELIEVES IT IS A CATCH. AL: 27 YARDS. TRIPLE DIGITS RIGHT NOW IT 115. KIRK: LET'S NOT TAKE THOSE CATCHES FOR GRANTED. WE ARE USED TO HIM DOING THAT. AL: THAT WAS SPECTACULAR. KIRK: RIGHT WHEN THEY SAID WHERE IS OUR CATCHES. AL: THEY WOKE HIM UP. SECOND AND GOAL. 40 YARD LINE, AARON JONES, SEVEN AND ITS REMAINING IN THE THIRD. KIRK: HE JUST HAS SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. WHEN I WATCH AND PLAY WITH JOE BURROW, I USED TO THINK, THIS GUY LOOKS LIKE HE PLAYED A LOT OF FOOTBALL IN HIS DAYS AS A KID, OLDER BROTHERS WHO PLAYED FOOTBALL, THEY PLAYED AT LSU, AND HE HAS SUCH NATURAL SAVVY. BEYOND JUST HE IS A GOOD RECEIVER, HE IS FAST. AL: MURPHY ON THE BENCH, INTERCEPTION, SETTING UP THE DARNOLD IN THE POCKET, FIRES. JEFFERSON GOT CRACKING THAT TIME BY WALLACE, AND THEY WILL SEND IT TO FIELD GOAL, TWO. KIRK: EVEN THOUGH THEY MOVED HIM TO THE LEFT TO THE RIGHT, HE WILL STILL FIND A WAY TO DOUBLE IT, TAKEN INSIDE, OUTSIDE, EVEN THAT DOUBLE MOVE, AND STARTING TO CREEP IN THERE WITH DARRISAW OUT AND DAVID QUESSENBERRY IN, I THINK HE FELT THE PRESSURE THAT TIME FROM THE LEFT SIDE WITH THAT BACKUP TACKLE. AL: REICHERT HAS NOT MISSED A KICK ALL SEASON. CHIP SHOT HERE. 23. SO THE VIKINGS HAVE THE LEAD THAT HAPPENED TWICE THE FIRST HALF. 17-14. WELL, T DOWNTOWN. LOS ANGELES, JEFFERSON MADE THOSE TWO CATCHES, INCLUDING THAT SPECTACULAR ONE, BUT COULD NOT PAID OFF IN THE END ZONE. FRUSTRATION ON THE SIDELINE. THE VIKINGS HAVE THE LEAD. REICHERT TO KICK OFF. AND DEEP IN THE END ZONE, WE GO TO KAYLEE ON THE SIDELINE. KAYLEE: IT IS TIME FOR TONIGHT'S JOURNEY, PRESENTED BY HON DAY. MATTHEW STAFFORD, THE NUMBER ONE OVERALL PICK IN THE 2009 DRAFT IS THE ONLY QUARTERBACK LEFT STANDING WEEKS LATER. MARK SANCHEZ MADE IT THE NEXT LONGEST AND HE HAD NOT FOR SIX YEARS. STAFFORD'S LONGEVITY HAS SURPASSED EVERY PLAYER IN THE DRAFT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THOMAS MORSTEAD, PROBABLY WITH A LITTLE LESS WEAR-AND-TEAR. STAFFORD NOW, FROM THE 22, 138, AND DOWN THE MIDDLE IS WILLIAMS. KIRK: HE GOT OFF TO A QUICK START. WE TALKED ALL DAY ABOUT HIM. PUKA NACUA IS BACK, AND THE BIGGEST THING WE SAW WAS THE BALL GETTING OUT OF HIS HANDS. IT IS TOUGH TO TACKLE THE VIKINGS DEFENSE AND TO BE ABLE TO HIT TO THAT LAST DRIVE. THEY GOT A GOOD PUSH ON THE LEFT SIDE, AND THEY DOUBLED, TRYING TO GET IT OVER THE TOP, AND JUST MISSED. AL: SECOND AND 8. THROWS, COCKED, OVER THE MIDDLE. AND THAT IS A FIRST DOWN. KIRK: LET'S GIVE THIS OFFENSIVE LINE CREDIT, ROOKIE AT CENTER, LEFT GUARD, AND STAFFORD IS ONE OF THE FIRST GUYS, IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE ARM ANGLES, BRETT FAVRE, AARON ROGERS, AND THEN HE SEES HIM SNEAK THAT IN, LIKE A SHORTSTOP, TALKING ABOUT HIS BASEBALL DAYS. JUST FLIPS IT RIGHT THERE. AND WITH ALL THAT TIME, EVENTUALLY, THEY WOULD FIND SOMEONE OVER. AL: UP IN MOTION. AND WILLIAMS DROPS IT. HAD NOT GOTTEN MUCH IN ALL LIKELIHOOD. SECOND DOWN AND 10. KIRK: ONE OF THE SMARTEST GUYS, PHILLIPS, THE NOSE GUARD, WAS OUT THERE, SEVENTH YEAR, OUT OF IT IS ALMOST BETTER OFF YOU DROPPED HIM. THAT BALL WAS DEFINITELY THROWN FORWARD BY STAFFORD. YOU ASKED EARLIER ABOUT JUSTIN JEFFERSON, AND WHERE IS SEE? WHERE IS COOPER KUPP? AL: HE HAS GOT THREE TONIGHT, 15 AND THAT IS CAUGHT AT THE 41. THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE TARGETED HIM TONIGHT, AND PULLS THAT BABY IN. KIRK: YOU SAW TYLER JOHNSON, HE GOES RIGHT INTO THE FLAT, PULLS THAT FLAT DEFENDER WITH HIM, GRIFFITH, AND A SIMPLE HIGH-LOW READ FOR AST READ FOR AS ACCURATE A QUARTERBACK AS YOU WILL SEE WAS STAFFORD WILL MAKE THAT THROUGH EVERY TIME. AL: WITH THE TWO BIG GUNS MISSING, UNTIL TONIGHT, HE WAS THE LEADING RECEIVER. PAUL PLAY ACTION, GOING DEEP, ON THE SIDELINE, AND IT IS BROKEN OUT AT THE VERY END BY MURPHY. GOT OUT IN FRONT, BUT MURPHY IS ABLE TO MAKE UP THE GROUND AND KNOCK IT DOWN. INCOMPLETE, SECOND AND 10. KIRK: YOU MOVE HIM, THE WAY MCVAY USUALLY DOES, BUT IT CREATES A MATCHUP FOR AN UNDERSIZED ATHLETE. HE THINKS HE HAS HELPED BUT THAT BALL IS THROWN, HE SAW IT A LITTLE BIT LATE, AND HE GAVE MURPHY ENOUGH TIME TO CATCH UP AND GET THE RIGHT HAND. IF HE HAD THROWN IT EARLIER, WE WOULD HAVE SEEN IT EARLIER, BUT THAT IS A TOUCHDOWN. AL: TWO BIG PLAYS NOW FOR MURPHY, THE INTERCEPTION, AND THAT ONE, THE PLAY CLOCK IS DOWN TO ZERO. KIRK: EVERYONE MOVED AGAIN. STAFFORD DID NOT GET UP. >> FALSE START. 79. AL: SECOND PENALTY. KIRK: MISSED OPPORTUNITY. NOW YOU GET A PENALTY. AL: SECOND DOWN AND 15, COOPER KUPP, EXPECTED TO PLAY, NACUA NOT EXPECTED TO PLAY, 87 YARDS. LIMITED TO 15. AND SIDELINE, ON THE LEFT, WIDE OPEN. THERE IS NACUA. HE TAKES IT TO THE 26 YARD LINE. AND HE MAKES THAT TACKLE. SEVEN CATCHES, 106 YARDS. KIRK: WATCH HIM LOOK LEFT AND THEN COME BACK, KNOWING EXACTLY WHERE HE WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH THE FOOTBALL. HIS EYES RIGHT NOW ARE OVER HERE TO JUST OPEN UP THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD, COMES BACK, STEPS INTO IT, AND THROWS AN ABSOLUTE BLAZER TO NACUA TO COME UP WITH A FIRST DOWN. AL: ONE OR TWO BY WILLIAMS, TACKLE, SECOND DOWN. KIRK: ALL THE TALK YESTERDAY, TODAY, ABOUT THE POTENTIAL, COULD A MATTHEW STAFFORD EVER GET MOVED? A LOT OF TIME IT COMES UP WITH THE SALARY AND THE CAP HIT, WHAT IT MIGHT BE. HE IS 36 YEARS OLD. HE IS PROBABLY IN AS GOOD OF SHAPE AS HE HAS BEEN HIS WHOLE LIFE, STILL MAKES THROWS LIKE I DON' I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT IS A CONVERSATION. AL: WAS IN DETROIT BEFORE HE CAME HERE. THROWS THIS ONE TO THE CORNER. REACHING FOR IT, AND A FLAG IS THROWN ON THE END ROBINSON COMES DOWN WITH IT FOR THE MOMENT. DEMARCUS ROBINSON. AND THE RAMS ALREADY CELEBRATING. 25 YARDS, AND THE FLAG WILL BE AGAINST MINNESOTA. KIRK: WE TALK SO MUCH ABOUT NACUA AND COOPER KUPP. HERE IS DEMARCUS ROBINSON, WHO GIVES ONE-ON-ONE. HE IS ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THAT HOLD. NO SAFETY SUPPORT OVER THE TOP. YOU ARE ON AN ISLAND, AND WITH THIS DEFENSE, AND WHEN RYAN FLOREZ PLAYS, YOU HAVE GOT TO BE ABLE TO HOLD UP. GOOD JOB. THEY ARE ABLE TO TAKE THE LEAD HERE IN THE THIRD. AL: ROBINSON'S FIRST CATCH OF MOVES IT THROUGH, 2.5, TO THE THIRD, AND THE RAMS HAVE THE LEAD FOR THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT. UP TO FOUR. KIRK: WHAT A CALL HERE BY SEAN MCVAY TO MOTION TYLER JOHNSON OVER HIM. WHEN HE MOVES THEM, IS GOING TO MOVE WITH THEM, WHICH TELLS MATTHEW STAFFORD, I HAVE ONE OUT HERE TODAY, -- OUT HERE, AND I'M GOING TO RUN. HE IS ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THE THAT IS THE THIRD QUARTER WITH GRIFFIN, AND THEY KNEW THE MATCHUP THEY HAD. IT IS ALMOST LIKE I TOLD YOU THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. I TOLD YOU WE GET THAT ONE ON ONE MATCH UP, AND HE DID IT. AL: THE CELEBRATION ON THE SIDELINES. THIS TIME, EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THE PASSING OF FERNANDO VALENZUELA, 63 YEARS OLD, AND FERNANDO MANIA OVERTOOK THE TOWN BACK IN THE EARLY 1980'S, PITCHED IN THE WORLD SERIES, GAME THREE, 1981, YANKEES-DODGERS. HE HAD THROWN 147 PITCHES THAT GAME, THIS IS GRANDFATHERS BASEBALL. THINK ABOUT THAT. THE DODGERS AN ACTION AGAINST THE YANKEES TOMORROW. WALKED SEVEN GUYS, GAVE UP NINE HITS AND PITCHED A COMPLETE KIRK: AMAZING. AL: TO THE 35 YARD LINE, MEANT SO MUCH TO THE TOWN. KIRK: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHEN YOU THINK OF FERNANDO? AL: JUST HIS DELIVERY, HE LOOKED AT THE SKY, ANOTHER WINDUP, THROW A SOMBRERO IN THE AIR, I MEAN, HE WAS VERY SPECIAL, VERY HUMBLE. WAS ON SPANISH-LANGUAGE RADIO WITH THE DODGERS FOR MANY YEARS, A WONDERFUL, HUMBLE MAN. HE TURNED THIS TOWN UPSIDE DOWN WHEN HE WAS PITCHING. KIRK: NO DOUBT. AL: SECOND AND 5, 35 YARD LINE. MOVES UP, THROWS, COCKED AT THE 45. AND FIRST DOWN. KIRK: WE HAVE TO SEE DARNOLD AGAIN, WHO HAS BEEN QUESTIONED THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER IF HE COULD BE THE GUY, BUT HE HAS THE ATHLETIC ABILITY TO GET OUT OF LAST WEEK ESPECIALLY, USING HIS LEGS, BUT JUST BACK THERE, TAKING OFF WHEN HE FEELS HE SUDDENLY MOVES UP, CLIMBS THE POCKET, CHECKS DOWN. THAT IS QUARTERBACKING IN THIS GREAT JOB. AL: JONES, ON THE TOSS. WE GO TO THE FINAL MINUTE. UNDER ONE MINUTE TO PLAY IN T THIRD. KIRK: BOBBY BROWN WORKING DOWN THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. 328 POUNDS, DOES A GOOD JOB OF ROTATING, TRYING TO STAY FRESH UPFRONT. I'M SURPRISED CHRIS TOLD ME THE UNSUNG HERO OF THIS DEFENSE IS 97 POINT BECAUSE THEY CAN DO SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS WITH IT. AL: THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, SON OF DAVID, THAT IS CAUGHT, ACROSS THE 50. NAILOR MAKES BACKGROUND. AND DARNOLD WILL TRY TO TAKE INTO THE LINE BEFORE THE END OF THE QUARTER. THIRD DOWN AND 3. TRYING TO DRAW THEM OFFSIDE, WHICH YOU CANNOT. TRIPLE DIGITS ON THE CLOCK, AND UPAL: FOURTH QUARTER, THE STANDINGS, EC THE VIKINGS FIVE AND ONE, THAT DIVISION THE TOUGHEST RIGHT NOW. THE RAMS TRYING TO GET TO 3-4, WOULD BE ONE GAME BACK OF THE SEAHAWKS, WHO THEY PLAY THIS SUNDAY. THE SEAHAWKS HOSTING BUFFALO THIS WEEK. DARNOLD STEPS UP IN THE POCKET. THROWS, AND IT IS ALONG THE SIDELINE. IT IS CAUGHT BY AARON JONES. KIRK: THIS IS A RED ALERT, RED ALERT, YOU HAVE A MATCHUP. THIS GUY IS 280 POUNDS. THERE IS NO WAY HE COULD MATCHUP WITH AARON JONES, AND A BIG THIRD DOWN, HE SAW THAT MATCHUP, HIS EYES LIT UP AND HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED TO DO. THAT IS A GOOD JOB GETTING HIS FEET DOWN. THIS GUY HAS WIDE RECEIVER FOOT SAT AS FAR AS RUNNING ROUNDS, AND HE GOT MATCHED UP AGAINST THE BIG I, WHO WE TALKED ABOUT BEING AN UNSUNG HERO. AL: ONE OF AARON ROGERS FAVORITE PLAYERS. AND A FLAG BEFORE THE SACK. >> TIMEOUT. MINNESOTA. THEIR FIRST OF THE HALF. 30 SECOND TIMEOUT. AL: PART OF THAT UNBELIEVABLE SEAN MCVAY COACHING, THE THIRD YOUNGEST COACH IN THE LEAGUE, WHICH MCVEIGH'S, ONLY MIKE MACDONALD IN SEATTLE, AND THIS GUY, FOUR GUYS WHO ARE FORMER ASSISTANTS, BRANDON STALEY IS ANOTHER GUY, WHO WAS WITH THE CHARGERS, NO UP IN SAN FRANCISCO , AND IT IS FRANKLY ASTONISHING. KIRK: IT REALLY IS, AND THE ENERGY HE PROVIDES, THEY LEARN FROM HIM, THEY HAVE WATCHED HIM. THAT SHOWS THE ENERGY OF THE MODERN PLAYER CAN GO A LONG WAY. AND WITH THE QUARTERBACK COACH, WITH SAM DARNOLD, HE IS PART OF THAT SAME STUFF. AL: ON THE GROUND. YOU SAW THAT GRAPHIC ABOUT EVERY YEAR OVER THE LAST FIVE, OFFENSE AND DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, HE MADE HIS OWN BED WITH THAT, AND HE IS SO GOOD TRAINING THESE BECOME VICTIMS OF YOUR OWN SUCCESS. SECOND AND 6. INSIGHT HANDOFF. THIRD DOWN, NOW AT THE 17 YARD JONES CARRYING HERE. HE HAS NOW CARRIED 18 TIMES TO THE 56 YARDS. KIRK: GREAT VISION, HE FINDS THE HOLE. GETS AS MUCH AS HE CAN OUT OF RAMS DEFENSE THIS YEAR HAS ALLOWED 120 YARDS OR MORE ON THE 6 C13 AL: THIRD AND 4. DARNOLD STEPPING UP. COULD NOT HANDLE IT. KIRK: THAT PUTS A REALLY TOUGH SPOT. YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE OF DARNOLD CLIMBING THE LADDR. WATCH HOW HE PULLS THE LINEBACKERS. ISRAEL HERE PULLING AWAY -- HERE HE IS RIGHT HERE PULLING AWAY. RIGHT ON THE MONEY. AL: 35 YARD FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT. UP AND GOOD. THAT WILL MAKE IT TIME FOR THE REPORT. WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT WILLIAMS BEING RELIABLE. THEY HAVE OPEN THINGS UP. HE GETS A TOUCHDOWN. THAT HAS OPENED UP MATTHEW IT LOOKS LIKE THE OLD OFFENSE FROM THE RAMS WERE USED TO SEEING. WILLIAMS HAVING A GREAT NIGHT TONIGHT AS WELL. AL: STAFFORD HAD THREE TOUCHDOWN PASSES ALL SEASON COMING INTO TONIGHT'S GAME HAD HE HAS THREE ON THE GAME, INCLUDING 12 THEY WILL BEGIN THEIR DRIVE FROM THE 30. KIRK: HE HAS A TOUCHDOWN AND 10 STRAIGHT GAMES. AL: 16 TOUCHDOWNS WITH THIS TEAM. HE HAS 10 OF THEM. THEY GO TO WORK FROM THE 30 ON FIRST AND 10. A FLAG. REFEREE: FIVE YARD PENALTY. AL: TURNER, THE ROOKIE, THE NUMBER ONE PICK OUT OF ALABAMA, WAS TO 12TH MAN IF YOU SEATTLE BUT NOT SO GREAT HERE KIRK: THERE THEY ARE. DALLAS TURNER, THE FIRST ROUNDER YOU MENTIONED. IT HAS BEEN TOUGH FOR HIM TO GET ON THE FIELD THIS YEAR. THIS KID IS GOING TO BE A SPECIAL PLAYER. RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE THREE GUYS AND ALL THREE OF THEM HAVE FIVE SACKS. AL: FIRST AND 5. STAFFORD DUMPS IT OFF. TO THE 44 YARD LINE GOES THE MICHIGAN ROOKIE. KIRK: IT IS SO FUN TO WATCH A QUARTERBACK WHO IS COMFORTABLE. HE TURNS HIS BACK ON PLAY ACTION AND CALMLY ALREADY KNOWS HE IS GOING TO CHECK THIS DOWN. LET THAT DEFENSE KEEP DROPPING HE KNOWS HE WANTS TO CHECK THIS BALL DOWN. ABLE TO PICK UP FIRST DOWN YARDAGE. AL: ROLLING LEFT, FIRING, CAUGHT, TO THE 38 YARD LINE. HUNTER LONG, FIRST TARGET AND CATCH FOR HIM TONIGHT. KIRK: WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE EDGE PRESSURE. YOU CANNOT LOSE CONTAIN HERE. THESE QUICK THROWS, ABLE TO SQUEEZE THEM IN THEIRE. AL: STAFFORD CAME OVER IN ONE OF THE BIGGEST TRADES EVER. JARED GOFF GOES THE OTHER WAY. HOW IS HE DOING? KIRK: REALLY WELL. BIG WIN LAST WEEK ON THE ROAD IT IS A RARE WIN-WIN FOR BOTH TEAMS. WILLIAMS BACK IN. STAFFORD PROTECTED WELL. HITS WILLIAMS. CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN. ABOUT A YARD SHY. MAKE IT THIRD AND 1. KIRK: THIS RAMS OFFENSE THIS DRIVE, A LOT OF PLAY-ACTION. THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROTECT AGAINST THE AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE. THEY ARE FRUSTRATED RIGHT NOW. WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT, BECAUSE THEY ARE ON SCHEDULE SO MUCH, IT IS NOT AS EASY TO DIAL UP THOSE PRESSURES. AL: A LITTLE SHORT OF THE FIRST THE RAMS BROUGHT EVERYBODY INSIDE. THE VIKINGS ARE ABLE TO JUST GET ENOUGH PRESSURE. KIRK: YOU SEE HIM OUT HERE. HE CANNOT BOUNCE IT. NOWHERE TO GO. I THINK IT IS CLOSE ENOUGH. STAFFORD COULD SNEAK IT. AL: SEAN MCVAY IS OUT ON THE FIELD ASKING IF WE CAN MEASURE? KIRK: IT IS HALF A YARD. AL: HE CAME ALL THE WAY OUT. GETS FREE, WILLIAMS, AFTER GETTING STOPPED IN THE HE HAS JUST ENOUGH TO PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN. KIRK: I KEEP SAYING, IT IS JUST ABOUT WHAT HE DOES AS A RECEIVER. I AM GETTING BEHIND THIS GUY. HE WILL TAKE ON THAT LINEBACKER. HE FINISHES THE BLOCK. THAT IS BEAUTIFUL. AL: THAT IS THE OVERLOOKED THING ABOUT HIM. HE IS SUCH A GOOD RECEIVER, YOU FORGET WHAT ELSE HE CAN DO. JOHNSON IN MOTION. NOT MUCH HAPPENING ON THE GROUND. KIRK: BRIAN FLOREZ TOLD ME ABOUT THEM COMING OVER FROM HOUSTON. THIS GUY IS A LUNCH PAIL GUY. HE DOES ALL OF THE DIRTY WORK. THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL PLAY. AL: EIGHT MINUTES LEFT IN THE FOURTH. THE FLAG IS THROWN. COOPER KUPP ALONG THE SIDELINES. KIRK: YOU WILL HAVE THE OFFENSIVE HOLDING BY MURPHY. AL: THE CROWD IS CHANTING "COOP ." IF IT GOES AGAINST THE RAMS, THEY WILL GO "BOO." THE OFFICIALS DISCUSSING IT. REFEREE: PASS INTERFERENCE, DEFENSE, NUMBER SEVEN. THE BALL WILL BE PLACED AT THE SPOT OF THE FOUL. KIRK: HE GRABBED ONTO HIS HAND, TRY TO PREVENT HIM FROM GETTING DID NOT ALLOW HIM TO GET HIS AL: THE RAMS HAVE NOT PICKED UP FIVE FIRST DOWNS BY PENALTY. KIRK: SEAN MCVAY SAID THEY HAVE TO FINISH DRIVES. AL: FROM THE 16. NICE PLAY. RIGHT NOW, 35 CAREER INTERCEPTIONS. TIED WITH TYRANN MATHIEU FOR MOST ACTIVE PLAYERS. KIRK: DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE JETS SWEET MOTION THAT CAME AROUND -- JET SWEEP MOTION THAT CAME AROUND. AL: SECOND AND 11. KIRK: CRUNCH TIME NOW IN THIS AL: WILLIAMS THREADING HIS WAY, PULLING HIS WAY TO THE 10. THIRD AND 4. KIRK: WEAVING AND PATIENTLY CUTTING. HE IS NOW OVER 100 SCRIMMAGE CHARTS ON THE NIGHT. 13TH TIME IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. WHEN WILL THE FANS AROUND THE LEAGUE RECOGNIZE NUMBER 23 OUT HERE? HE IS THE REAL DEAL. AL: WITHOUT A DOUBT. 20 CARRIES, 96 GROUND YARDS HE TAUGHT A TOUCHDOWN PASS. KIRK: THEY HAVE THEM LINED UP ON THE LEFT. AL: OUT OF THE SLOT. STAFFORD TO THE END ZONE, CAUGHT FOR A TOUCHDOWN, DEMARCUS ROBINSON. ROBINSON TONIGHT, TWO TOUCHDOWN KIRK: NICE, CLEAN ROUTE BY YOU RUN OUT OF THINGS YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT THIS GUY. HE LOOKS LEFT BUT NOW HE WILL COME BACK OVER HERE TO FIND ROBINSON MATCHED UP AGAINST HARRISON SMITH. ZONE COVERAGE FROM THE LEFT. BACK TO THE RIGHT. RIGHT BETWEEN THE SAFETY AND THE CORNER, ROBINSON ABLE TO SEPARATE FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. WHAT A DRIVE BY THE RAMS. 6:30, 10 PLAYS, 70 YARDS. AL: THE EXTRA POINT. STAFFORD, FOUR TOUCHDOWN PASSES AL: GOING BACK TO THE MEADOWLANDS ON HALLOWEEN NIGHT NEXT THURSDAY NIGHT. THE TEXANS AGAINST THE JETS. WE HOPE THE GAME WILL BE DRAMATIC. THERE IS ALWAYS HIGH DRAMA WITH THE NEW YORK JETS. WE LOVE TO TALK ABOUT IT. THE VIKINGS NOW DOWN BY EIGHT. THEY WILL START AT THE 30. KIRK: IT HAS BEEN A GREAT NIGHT FOR JUSTIN JEFFERSON. SO MANY THINGS SEE BRINGS TO AN HE HAS THE ABILITY TO HURT YOU. YOU KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO GET HIM THE BALL. THE RAMS WILL PROBABLY PUT A CORNER ON THE OUTSIDE AND SAFETIES ON THE INSIDE. HE IS MOVING ALREADY IN MOTION. AL: SETTING UP ON THE LEFT SIDE. THAT WILL BE A FIRST DOWN. JOSH OLIVER. KIRK: YOU HAVE A MAN COVERAGE. THIS IS A BUST BY THE RAMS LOOK AT ALL THE DEFENSIVE BACKS. NOBODY STAYS WITH JOSH OLIVER. HE IS A LITTLE HESITANT TO GET I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IDENTIFY THEM AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. HE WAS ABLE TO SLIP OUT. GREAT WAY TO START THIS DRIVE. AL: 2 YARD PICKUP. JONES TONIGHT, 19 CARRIES, 58 KIRK: HE HAS A TENDENCY TO BE ABLE TO HOLD ONTO SOME THINGS OFFENSIVELY UNTIL THE FOURTH AL: DANCING AROUND, SACKED, ALL THE WAY BACK AT THE 40 YARD KIRK: HE IS OUT OF THIS LINE. GOING UP AGAINST QUIZZING BARRY -- QUISENBERRY AT THE LEFT TACKLE SPOT. LOOK AT HIM. THE ATHLETIC ABILITY. YOU CANNOT RUN AWAY. HE HAS POWER, QUICKNESS, HE IS FIRED UP. UNDER PRESSURE AGAIN. NOBODY HOME. KIRK: THESE LINEBACKERS HAVE ALLOWED A LOT OF THESE ROUTES TO GET BEHIND THEM. HERE ON 3RD AVENUE LONG, MUCH BETTER AT TAKING THAT AWAY. NO ONE WAS OPEN. AL: THE VIKINGS FORCED INTO A POSITION WHERE THEY WILL MOST LIKELY HAVE TO USE THEIR TIMEOUTS ON THE EVENTS. THE PUNT IS FAIR CAUGHT AT THE 19 YARDET'S TAKE A LOOK. WE MENTIONED JUSTIN JEFFERSON THIS KID IS A SPECIAL PLAYER. HE HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME. 31ST GAME WITH OVER 100 YARDS RECEIVING. AL: THE RAMS NOW FROM THE 19. THE VIKINGS HAVE TO THINK USING THEIR TIMEOUTS ON THIS SIDE OF THE BALL. THEY ARE DOWN ONE TIMEOUT BECAUSE THEY USE ONE EARLIER. KIRK: YOU HAVE TO GET OFF THE FIELD AND GIVE THE OFFENSE A SEAN MCVAY, HIS TEAMS HAVE BEEN SO CLOSE. ALL OF THESE ONE POSSESSION GAMES. A CLOSE LOST TO CHICAGO, GREEN BAY. HERE IT IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM. CAN THEY FINISH IT? AL: THE VIKINGS ARE OFF TO A GOOD START IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY REALLY NEED A THREE AND THEY TAKE THEIR FIRST OF THE TWO TIMEOUTS REMAINING RIGHT HERE. KIRK: THIS OFFENSIVE LINE HAS HAD A MUCH BETTER GAME THAN I THINK ANYBODY WOULD TALK ABOUT. NOW THESE FIRST COUPLE OF PLAYS, A COUPLE OF OBVIOUS RUN. NOW IT IS THIRD AND LONG. AL: I THINK HE IS ROLLING THE DICE. KIRK: WITH A QUARTERBACK WHO HE TRUSTS AND RECEIVERS YOU KNOW HE CAN MAKE PLAYS. YOU ARE TRUSTING YOUR OFFENSIVE LINE TO GIVE STAFFORD TIME. IF HE HAS TIME, CHANCES ARE HE WILL FIND AN OPEN MAN. AL: NACUA TO THE RIGHT. THIRD AND 9. STAFFORD LOOKED TO HIM. IT IS CAUGHT BY COOPER KUPP. HE STARTED WITH A COUPLE OF CATCHES BUT HAS BEEN VERY QUIET SINCE THEN. A BIG TIME PLAYED HERE. KIRK: THEY GET LOST IN COVERAGE WITHOUT MOTION. HE DID SAY LATE BREAK. AND HE DOES NOT FIND THE FOOTBALL. THE MOTION, THE STACKS RECEIVER, LOSING COOPER KUPP. BY THE TIME HE COMES OVER, HE CANNOT LOCATE THE FOOTBALL. GOOD JOB WORKING BACK BY COOPER KUPP, BACK TO THE FOOTBALL, INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR IT, HE WENT AND GOT IT. YOU TRUST YOUR QUARTERBACK AND YOUR RECEIVERS AND YOU PROBABLY HAVE A CHANCE TO SECURE VICTORY WITH THAT PLAY CALL. AL: THEY FORCED MINNESOTA TO USE THEIR FINAL TIMEOUT. BOOM ONE CLOCK STOPPAGE REMAINS OF THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING. COOPER KUPP, ALL OF THE CHATTER ABOUT A TRADE. SOME BIG TIME RECEIVERS HAVE GONE IN DEALS OVER THE LAST WEEK. GOING BACK TO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. IF YOU ARE 2-5 YOU ARE LISTENING A LOT CLOSER THAT AT 3-4. KIRK: THEY WERE 3-6 A YEAR AGO BUT STILL MAY THE POSTSEASON. NOW YOU ARE ON THE VERGE OF GOING 3-4. WINNING TWO GAMES IN FIVE DAYS. I DON'T SEE THEM MOVING GUYS. AL: IF NOTHING ELSE, THE PRICE JUST WENT UP. THEY KEEP IT ON THE GROUND. KIRK: WITH THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING, A FIRST DOWN INTO THE GAME -- THEY STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. IT IS NOT OVER YET. JUST STAYING IN BOUNDS. DOES HE? HE DOES. YOU DO NOT WANT TO STEP OUT OF BOUNDS AND GIVE THEM SOME EXTRA THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING. KIRK: A HECKUVA JOB BY MURPHY HOLY OFF ROBINSON. VAN DINGELL RUNNING. LOOKING AT THE CLOCK AND HOPING THEY WILL GET ONE MORE SHOT. AL: THE RAMS WILL HAVE A THIRD AND 12 WHEN WE COME BACK. -- POSTING SHOW. KIRK: WE THOUGHT THEY WOULD GIVE CONFIDENCE. THEY DON'T RUN IT. MAKING SURE HE STAYS IN BOUNDS. THAT WILL GET REALLY CLOSE. KIRK: I THINK HE STEPPED OUT OF BOUNDS. AL: AND HE DID NOT GET A FIRST KIRK: WOW. AL: NACUA ALMOST WENT OUT OF THEY WERE TRYING TO FORCE THEM THAT IS HUGE. NOW YOU HAVE TO PUNT. BRANDON POWELL BACK AT THE 10 LAST TIME HE PUT SOME GOOD BACKSPIN AUDIT. -- ON IT. WHAT A KICK. SPOTTED AT THE 3. HE DOES IT AGAIN. THAT IS CLUTCH. HE HAS NOT DONE A GREAT JOB PUNTING. HE IS THE KICKOFF MAN. NOW THEY JUST HAVE TO GO 97 YARDS AND MAKE A TWO-POINT CONVERSION. I A KEEPING AN EYE ON THAT LEFT NOW THEY WILL TRY TO DIAL UP THEY MIGHT WANT TO MOVE THE POCKET. AL: 95 YARDS TO GO. THAT PASS IS UNDERTHROWN A LITTLE BIT. IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND 10. A LATE FLAG HAS COME IN. OFFENSE, NUMBER 18, WAS NOT ON THE LINE. THAT PENALTY WILL BE DECLINED. AL: SECOND DOWN AND 10. KIRK: THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, I DON'T CARE THAT THEY ARE PINNED BACK, WHERE IS 18? THE RAMS ARE THINKING PRESSURE OVER THE LEFT TACKLE. WHERE IS NUMBER 18 LINED UP? HE IS MOVING FROM RIGHT TO LEFT ALL THE WAY AT THE TOP. AL: LOOK OUT, SAFETY. YOUNG. TAKES HIM DOWN IN THE END ZONE. RAMS SEAL IT. 30-20. KIRK: SOMETHING HAPPENED TO MAYBE HE GRABBED UNDERNEATH AND GOT THE JERSEY. SOMETHING MADE HIS HEAD GO BACK. THE LEFT SIDE IS WHERE THE PRESSURE CAME FROM. YOUNG WORKS THROUGH IT. HE GOT A HOLD OF SOMETHING. LET'S SEE. HE GOT THE FACEMASK. HE SURE DID. THEY CANNOT REVIEW THAT. BUT HE DEFINITELY GOT THE FACEMASK. RIGHT THERE. ANYTIME YOU SEE A GUYS HEAD GETS SPUN BACKWARD, SOMETHING HAPPENED. HE GOT AWAY WITH ONE RIGHT AL: FIGHTING FANS ARE SAYING WHAT THE HELL? KIRK: THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN REVIEW. AL: THEY MISTED. -- MISSED IT. KIRK: THE DEFENSE BASICALLY WON THE GAME A WEEK AGO. THEY STEP UP HERE IN A BIG WAY LATE. AL: THAT IS NOT A REVIEWABLE SITUATION. KIRK: THAT IS A FACEMASK. AL: THEY WILL GET CREDIT FOR TWO POINTS. KIRK: THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FIRST AND 10 AT THE 20 WITH 1:36 LEFT IN THE GAME. AL: MEANWHILE, THE VIKINGS HAVE THE CLARE FOR AN ONSIDE KICK, FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH. IT HAS TO GO 10 YARD. REFEREE: TIMEOUT, LOS ANGELES. AL: THE CHANCES OF THEM WINNING THE GAME WOULD'VE STILL BEEN MINIMAL. KIRK: BUT IT IS A FIRST DOWN AND IT GETS YOU OUT OF THE SHADOW OF YOUR OWN GOAL LINE. AND YOU HAVE JUSTIN JEFFERSON AND THESE RECEIVERS, WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS. AL: HUMAN ERROR. KIRK: IT IS PART OF THE GAME. AL: SEAN MCVAY'S TEAM WAS 1- 4. NOW THEY WILL LIKELY GO TO 3-4. THEY HAVE A MINI-BYE. THE THURSDAY NIGHT GAME GIVES YOU 10 DAYS. THE VIKINGS HAVE INDIANAPOLIS NEXT WEEK. THEN THEY GO TO JACKSONVILLE, TENNESSEE, AND CHICAGO. KIRK: THE RAMS, ONCE THEY GET THERE STARTERS BACK -- THEIR STARTERS BACK. AL: SOFI STADIUM, THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS. KIRK: HIS FACE SAYS IT ALL. NOT ONLY A VICTORY, BUT TO THINK ABOUT WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE THE BYE. 1-4 WITH A TON OF INJURIES AND A LOT OF QUESTIONS. THEY DID NACUA AND KUPP BACK, THEY WIN LAST WEEK. THE DIVISION IS WIDE OPEN. AL: DO NOT WRITE THEM OFF. WHO WOULD' WHO WOULD'VE GUESSED, YOU KNEW KUPP WAS COMING BACK. YOU DIDN'T KNOW NACUA WAS COMING A DIFFERENT SITUATION. HERE IS THE UPCOMING SCHEDULE. PHILADELPHIA WILL COME IN HERE. BUFFALO WEEK 14, LOOKING AHEAD. KIRK: A DIFFERENT FEEL WHEN YOU PUT THOSE TWO OUT THERE. THE RUNNING GAME WITH WILLIAMS. IT IS THE OFFENSE YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM SEAN MCVAY AND WAIT UNTIL THEY GET SOME OF THEIR OFFENSIVE LINEMAN BACK. AL: SEAN MCVAY LOVES WHEN WE COME TO TOWN FOR A THURSDAY NIGHT GAME. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, BAKER MAYFIELD CAME IN. WHO COULD FORGET THAT? HE LED THEM ON A GIGANTIC DRIVE AT THE END OF THE GAME. HELPED HIM TURN HIS CAREER KIRK: THE VIKINGS WILL BE JUST FINE. THEY WILL GET IT GOING. A BIG NIGHT FOR MATTHEW NACUA HAD 106 RECEIVING YARDS. THE RAMS GET A NICE 10 DAY WILLIAMS TONIGHT, 23 CARRIES, 97 HE HAS A TOUCHDOWN NOW INTEND THE RAMS WHEN IT
