-- POINTS ON THE BOARD. STEELERS ARE SIX-TWO, RAVENS ARE SIX-THREE, BENGALS ARE 4-5 AND ZAC TAYLOR TOOK THEM TO THE SUPER BOWL. JOHN HARBAUGH IS IN HIS 17TH YEAR. JOE BURROW AND LAMAR JACKSON HAVING GREAT SEASONS, LAMAR THE FRONT RUNNER TO WIN THE M.V.P. AWARD, IN THE CONVERSATION, WINNING TWO OF THOSE. RAVENS TO KICK OFF, WINNING THE TOSS, DEFERRED AND JOE BURROW WILL SET UP SHOP AT THE 30 YARD LINE. HE SAID HE WAS PLAYING THE BEST BALL OF HIS CAREER. 20-4, COMPLETING 70% OF PASSES AND YOU SAW HOW UPSET HE WAS, FIVE A PERFECTIONIST. OUT OF THE GUN, CHASE IN MOTION TO THE LEFT SIDE. WITHOUT TEE HIGGINS, HE IS OUT FOR ONE MORE GAME AND WE GET A SEVEN YARD GAIN. CHASE BROWN 157 SCRIMMAGE YARDS AGAINST LAS VEGAS, SECOND DOWN AND THREE. KIRK: THIS IS AN EXTENSION OF THEIR RUNNING GAME. THEY RUN THE BALL A LOT INSIDE ZONE COVERAGE WHICH BALTIMORE HAS HAD SOME PROBLEMS WITH WITH LINEBACKERS. AL: NUMBER ONE AGAINST THE RUN. SECOND DOWN AND THREE, PLAY ACTION, HE STEPS UP. CHASE HAS THE MOST OF ANY RECEIVER AND A FIRST DOWN. KIRK: JOE HAS PLAYED GOOD FOOTBALL AND FOR HIM TO SAY THIS IS THE BEST HE'S PLAYED, HE NEEDS THE MOST CONSISTENT -- HE MEANS THE MOST CONSISTENT ON THE BACK HALF OF THE SEASON. AL: FROM THE 43 UP THE MIDDLE, NOTHING HAPPENING IN THE RAVENS ARE NUMBER ONE AGAINST THE RUN, STOPPING CHASE BROWN AFTER ONE YARD, SECOND DOWN AND NINE. KIRK: SUCH STRENGTH WITH TRAVIS JONES HEALTHY, RODRICK WASHINGTON, THEY CREATE THE WALL AND FREE UP THE LINEBACKERS SO YOU WILL NOT SEE A LOT OF THEM RUN. AL: FIRST YEAR COORDINATOR MIKE MACDONALD, HE IS NOW THE HEAD COACH OF SEATTLE. PASS IS BROKEN UP, INCOMPLETE, MARLON HUMPHREY GETS IN, BATTED AWAY, JERMAINE BURTON, ROOKIE OUT OF ALABAMA PLAYING TONIGHT. KIRK: HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE ROOKIE AND GREAT TO SEE HEALTHY. A SEASON, NUMBER ONE PICK OUT OF ALABAMA, THIRD AND NINE. JOE BURROW STEPPING FORWARD, THROWING, IT'S CAUGHT. JA'MARR CHASE AT THE 50 YARD LINE SO JOE BURROW COMING FORWARD BEFORE HE GETS TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, COMPLETES THAT. KIRK: GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING, CHASE OFF TO YOUR RIGHT, JOE BUYS DOWNFIELD, CHASE IN LINE WITH THE QUARTERBACK. AL: GIVE IT TO BROWN ON THE OUTSIDE, PICKS UP ONE. GOT AWAY FROM DAVID, SECOND DOWN , NEEDED TO. KIRK: JOE BURROW DOES NOT GET THE RECOGNITION FOR HIS ABILITY IN MANEUVERING, THE FUNDAMENTALS WHEN HE MOVES, TO HANDS ON THE FOOTBALL. UNDERRATED ATHLETE. AL: BROWN THROUGH THE MIDDLE RUNS INTO PURPLE SHIRTS, THIRD DOWN AND FOUR ON THE OPENING DRIVE, TANGLES HAVE PICKED UP THE TEMPO, THIRD AND FOUR AND NOW JOE BURROW WILL SLOW DOWN. KIRK: HE SAID POSSESSIONS WILL BE LIMITED, CANNOT SETTLE, WE HAVE TO SCORE TOUCHDOWNS. AL: TAKES THE PLAY CLOCK DOWN TO SIX SECONDS IN THE POCKET, OPEN, TAKING IT INTO THE FIVE YARD LINE, SECOND YEAR OUT OF PRINCETON, SECOND AND GOAL. KIRK: HE WORKS OVER THE MIDDLE, CINCINNATI GOES OUT AND A GREAT THROW, GREAT THROW. AL: PLAYS FOR TOUCHDOWNS. JOE BURROW LOOKS LEFT, THROWS THERE. TWO TOUCHDOWNS AGAINST THE RAIDERS. KIRK: HE IS A TOUGH MATCH SHOW, LAMAR WANTS TO THROW THE FLAG. WE SAW HIM TALKING TO THE OFFICIAL. WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT IS A CATCH. USES THE FLAG EARLY ON FIVE MINUTES INTO THE GAME, CATCH WAS GOOD. THE NEED IS DOWN. IT APPEARS TO HAVE CONTROL IN THE BALL COMES OUT AS HAMILTON MAKES THE TACKLE ON THE SIDELINE. NOT RIGHT. >> AFTER REVIEW, IT IS A CATCH. AL: MOST INTERESTING ASPECT IS THE CHALLENGE. SECOND AND GOAL REGARDLESS, YOU TELL ME. SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. JOE BURROW TO THE END ZONE, INCOMPLETE. CHASE COVERED BY HUMPHREY, THIRD DOWN AND GOAL. KIRK: GREAT MATCHUP MAN TO MAN. HUMPHREY GETS CHASE. HE SAID CHASE IS A RUNNING BACK PLAYING WIDE RECEIVER, HE CAN AL: HERE COMES THE 11TH PLAY OF THE OPENING DRIVE. AND A TIMEOUT TAKEN HERE BY BALTIMORE, MAY HAVE HAD AN EXTRA MAN ON THE FIELD. >> BALTIMORE TAKES IT SECOND TIMEOUT. AL: GOING BACK TO THE CHALLENGE, YOU LOSE A CHALLENGE AND THAT IS BIGGER THAN LOSING A TIMEOUT. KIRK: ZACH IN HIS FIRST YEAR NOT JUST CALLING THE PLAYS, EVERYBODY IN AND OUT, A PENALTY AND THEY DO NOT GET THAT THE RAVENS WILL HAVE ONE OF THE BEST DEFENSES AND AT THIS POINT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN THAT CONSISTENT. AL: THIRD AND GOAL, CHASE DOWN, BURROW THROWING IN THAT TIME THEY GOT THE PASS THAT THEY VERY MUCH NEEDED AND THIS DRIVE WILL RESULT IN A FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT 468 YARDS. KIRK NOT SETTLING FOR FIELD GOALS, THEY THINK THEY WILL HAVE TO OUTSCORE LAMAR JACKSON BUT THEY WILL NOT KICK THE FIELD GOAL. AL: AND WITH FOURTH AND GOAL. CROWD RISING AS ONE. BROWN AND SAMPLE THE TIGHT END OVER THE BACKFIELD. NOW BROWN IN THE SLOT, JOE BURROW, CHASE, PRESSURE, FIRES. UNBELIEVABLE PLAY. TRYING TO HIT CHASE, BROWN WAS COVERED. OUT OF THE POCKET. KIRK: BRANDON STEPHENS. THAT IS WHEN THE FLAG WAS THROWN AL: THAT IS THE GUY, IF KIRK: CHASE WORKS INSIDE, TRIES TO WORK HIS WAY BACK OUT. THEY GRABBED HOLD OF HIM AS HE TRIES TO WORK BACK TO THE OUTSIDE. IT WAS FOURTH-AND-GOAL, SO THEY GET FIRST AND GOAL NOW. AL: FROM THE 1. LOOKING FOR THE END ZONE AND FINDING IT -- CHASE BROWN FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. THE BENGALS COME IN AFTER SCORING 41 AGAINST VEGAS. REAGAN'S WON -- RAVENS WON THE TOSS AND DEFERRED AND THE BENGALS SAID TAKE THIS. KIRK: THEY MET IN WEEK FIVE, IT WENT INTO OVERTIME. BOTH THE QUARTERBACKS PUT UP BIG NUMBERS. CINCINNATI CAME IN ANTICIPATING HAVING TO SCORE TOUCHDOWNS. THEY CATCH A BREAK ON THE DEFENSIVE HOLDING CALL. FIVE MINUTES OFF THE CLOCK ON THAT DRIVE. AL: MCPHERSON FOR THE EXTRA POINT. WITH 9:23 TO GO IN THE OPENING QUARTER ON THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL IN BALTIMORE, BENGALS 7 , RAVENS 0. HT. THEY LIKE TO SAY A PERFECT NIGHT FOR FOOTBALL BUT THIS IS PRETT CLOSE. KIRK: THIS IS A PERFECT NIGHT. AL: IT IS DRY, A BIG CROWD -- AND A VERY LIVELY ONE. THEY WERE QUIETED BY THE BENGALS FOR THE MOMENT. THE RAVENS WILL GET THE BALL AT THE 30 YARD LINE AND THAT IS WHERE WE WILL SEE LAMAR JACKSON GO TO WORK. JOE BURROW SAID HE IS PLAYING HIS BEST BALL, LAMAR JACKSON HAS ALREADY WON TWO M.V.P. AWARDS. LAST WEEK HE THREW AS MANY TOUCHDOWN PASSES AS INCOMPLETIONS AND HIS RATING WAS PERFECT, 158.3. KIRK: NOT JUST LAST WEEK BUT THE ENTIRE SEASON. 20 TOUCHDOWNS, TWO INTERCEPTIONS. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN HE WAS AN ATHLETE PLAYING QUARTERBACK AND HAPPENS TO BE ATHLETIC. AL: HE IS FLANKED BY DERRICK HENRY. WHAT ASSIGNING THAT WAS. JACKSON GOING DEEP ON THE FIRST PLAY AND BROKEN UP AT THE 32 YARD LINE. TRYING TO GET IT TO BATEMAN ALL THE WAY DOWN FIELD. CAM TAYLOR-BRITT BREAKS IT UP. KIRK: THEY MOVE BATEMAN FROM THE RIGHT TO THE LEFT, TRYING TO CREATE A MATCHUP. GET LAMAR JACKSON TO WHAT HE HAS. HE HAD BATEMAN BEHIND THE COVERAGE. TAYLOR-BRITT CAME OVER LATE AND RECOVERED NICELY. HE ACTUALLY GOT A AL: THEIR NUMBER 2 RECEIVER. ZAY FLOWERS, NUMBER 4, HE HAS BEEN FANTASTIC. HERE GOES HENRY. YOU THINK HE HAS THEM STOPPED AND HE WILL PICK UP ANOTHER COUPLE OF YARDS. HE TURNS A THREE YARD GAIN INTO A SIX YARD GAIN. THIRD DOWN AND 4. KIRK: BALTIMORE HAS HAD THE BENGALS' NUMBER. LAMAR JACKSON, 9-1 AS A STARTER AGAINST THE BENGALS. HE GETS TO THE THIRD AND 4, YOU ARE AT THE MERCY OF THE PLAYCALLING OF T OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. AL: JUSTICE HILL GETS TAKEN DOWN. HILL. KIRK: WHAT A JOB. B.J. HILL TOOK A HIT LAST WEEK. SOME PEOPLE WONDERED HOW MUCH HE WOULD BE ABLE TO PLAY. HE USES HIS HANDS TO GET OFF THE BLOCK OF THE ROOKIE ROSENGARTEN, AND MAKES THE PLAY IN THE BACKFIELD. ONE OF PLAY BY THE INTERIOR OF THIS BENGALS DEFENSE. AL: THE BENGALS CONTROL IT FOR ALMOST SIX MINUTES AND THE RAVENS HAVE A THREE AND OUT. JORDAN STOUT WILL PUNT DOWN TO TRENTON IRWIN. HE SIX YEARS IT OUT ABOUT THE 10 YARD LINE. KIRK: AMAZING IF YOU THINK ABOUT HERE WE ARE, VERY CLOSE, ALMOST THE SAME WEEK IN THE SEASON, JOE BURROW HAD THE INJURY. THE RIGHT WRIST. AFTER THAT THROW HE GOES OVER TO THE SIDELINE AND TRY TO WORK IT OUT. HE DID NOT MAKE A THROW, HE SAID I AM DONE. HE HAD SURGERY IN THE OFF-SEASON. TRY TO GET HIMSELF BACK. YOU CAN SEE HOW FRUSTRATED HE IS. HE SAID I AM PLAYING THE BEST FOOTBALL OF MY CAREER. YEAR LATER. AL: HE WAS OUT FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON. HE GETS HIT FROM BEHIND. THAT TIME, OWEH -- ODAFE OWEH KNOCKS HIM DOWN. KIRK: CODY FORD IS IN FOR ORLANDO BROWN. THEY DECIDED TO KEEP ORLANDO BROWN DOWN. LOOK AT THAT HOP, JUMP, SKIP AND SPEED OFF THE EDGE. THAT IS WHAT OWEH IS SUPPOSED TO BE -- THE GUY OFF THE EDGE. HE DELIVERS AGAINST THE BACKUP LEFT TACKLE, CODY FORD. AL: THE RAVENS GETTING A DECENT PASS RUSH. GETTING BURROW OUT OF THE POCKET AGAIN. THROWS AND IS LUCKY THAT WAS NOT PICKED AT THE 20-YARD LINE. AR'DARIUS WASHINGTON, WHO HEADED INTERCEPTION IN LAST WEEK'S GAME, COULD NOT HANG ON AND IT IS THIRD AND 10. JOB OF TRYING TO GET THIS PLAY ALIVE. WATCH THE HAND GESTURE. HE TRIES TO MOVE PEOPLE AND GET SOMEONE TO HELP HIM OUT. OVER THERE. GESICKI MOVES LATE. 6'6" AGAINST 5'8", QUICK THIS WINS -- QUICK THIS -- QUICKNESS WINS. AL: THEY WILL TAKE A TIMEOUT. REFEREE: CINCINNATI TAKES ITS FIRST TIMEOUT. AL: LET'S GO TO KAYLEE. KAYLEE: A YEAR LATER JOE BURROW SAID THIS IS THE BEST HE FELT SINCE HE TORE THAT LIGAMENT IN HIS RIGHT WRIST HERE IN BALTIMORE. HE TOLD US THE SCAR TISSUE CONTINUES TO BREAK DOWN AND HE IS GETTING MORE RANGE OF MOTION. IF YOU WATCH HIM CLOSELY ON THE SIDELINE, YOU CAN SEE THE MOMENTS HE IS INSTINCTUALLY MOVING AROUND TO TRY TO KEEP THE WRIST LOOSE. AL: SO FAR, SO GOOD. HE COMES INTO THIS GAME WITH A 5-1 TOUCHDOWN TO INTERCEPTION RATIO. THIRD AND 10. PRESSURE. EXTRA PRESSURE. FIRES, TOO HIGH. FLAG -- THERE IS A FLAG. KIRK: IT IS THE ROOKIE, NATE WIGGINS. IT IS RISKY TO LEAVE A ROOKIE AN ISLAND. REFEREE: PASS INTERFERENCE, DEFENSE, NUMBER 2. KIRK: HE GETS HELD. LOOK HOW CLOSE THEY CAME TO COMPLETING THAT. YOU SEE HOW FRUSTRATED JA'MARR CHASE IS, HE GETS THE CALL. AL: WIGGANS WAS THEIR NUMBER ONE TRAFFIC OUT OF CLEMSON. KIRK: THE FOURTH DOWN CALL THAT GIVES THEM A TOUCHDOWN, AND NOW PINNED BACK DEEP IN THEIR OWN TERRITORY AND THEY GET A CALL. MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR JOHN HARBAUGH'S DEFENSE. AL: THE CROWD DID NOT LIKE IT. BROWN TO THE 30 YARD LINE. THEY HAVE ZACK MOSS, GOT HIM FROM INDIANAPOLIS -- THEY LET JOE MIXON GO -- MOSS IS ON INJURED RESERVE SO BROWN HAS BECOME THE GUY. FROM CHICAGO. KIRK: CHASE BROWN HAS BEEN REALLY IMPRESSIVE. CATCHES THE BALL OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. HE HAD FIVE CATCHES, 30 SEVEN YARDS AND A TOUCHDOWN LAST WEEK TO GO WITH THE RUSHING YARDS. HE CANNOT KEEP TAKING A SO THAT IS WHY THEY SIGNED KHALIL HERBERT. AL: BURROW STEPS UP AND THROWS, THAT IS A FIRST DOWN AND THAT IS BROWN AGAIN. SCORE THE TOUCHDOWN EARLIER. IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US, CINCINNATI MARCHED DOWN THE FIELD, 70 YARDS. RAVENS WIN THREE AND OUT. THE ENTIRE CONTROLLED BY CINCINNATI. KIRK: THERE IS A HERBERT, COMING OVER FROM CHICAGO. HE WAS NOT USED A LOT. D'ANDRE SWIFT CAME OVER. HERBERT MIGHT GET MORE OF AN OPPORTUNITY HERE IN CINCINNATI. AL: BROWN AGAIN. GOOD RUN AGAIN. AND A FLAG IS DOWN BACK AT THE 36 YARD LINE. KIRK: IS IT A HOLD ON KARRAS, THE CENTER. REFEREE: HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER 64. 10-YARD PE KIRK: HE IS TRYING TO MAKE A REACH BLOCK. TOUGH TO DO. WORKING TO HIS LEFT, HE TRIES TO GET OUT IN FRONT AND THEN JUST ENDS UP HOLDING DOWN. THERE HE IS RIGHT HERE. HE IS OFF TO THE LEFT GAP, GETS HIS HANDS UP AND BRINGS THE BIG MAN DOWN. AL: BENGALS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE LEAGUE AT AVOIDING PENALTIES. ONLY 37 YARDS PER GAME, SECOND BEST IN THE NFL. FIRST AND 20. BURROW TO THE OUTSIDE, THAT IS CAUGHT. BREAKING A TACKLE AND GETTING ABOUT NINE IS GESICKI. KIRK: I THINK YOU WILL SEE MORE AND MORE OF THAT WITH GESICKI UP ON THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND JA'MARR CHASE STACKED BEHIND HIM. IT PUTS THE DEFENSE IN A BIND AND YOU FREE UP JA'MARR CHASE TO GIVE HIM OPTION ROUTES DEPENDING ON THE COVERAGE. THAT IS AN AREA THAT DAN PITCHER, THE OFFENSE OF COORDINATOR, HAS PUT A LOT MORE ON JA'MARR CHASE, GIVING HIM FREEDOM AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. INSTEAD OF BEING STATIONARY AT ONE SPOT. AL: THAT IS TANNER HUDSON MAKING THE CATCH. A SECONDARY HAS BEEN EXPLOITED. NUMBER 1 AGAINST THE RUSH, DEAD LAST AGAINST THE PASS. KIRK: TEAMS DO NOT TRY TO RUN ON THEM A LOT. YOU WILL NOT GET A LOT OF PRODUCTION. THEY ARE RELEASED OUT IN THE MIDDLE WITHOUT INTERIOR. ROQUAN SMITH ALWAYS CONTROLLING THE INTERIOR, AS WELL. TOUGH SLEDDING UP FRONT, TRY TO GET THE SHORT PASSING GAME AGAINST THE LINEBACKERS. AL: BENGALS RUNNING THEIR 19TH PLAY. PRESSURE AGAIN. BROWN MAKES A NICE BLOCK AND CHASE MAKES THE CATCH ALONG THE THEY GO FROM FIRST AND 20 TO THIRD AND 2, TO A FIRST DOWN. KIRK: THAT IS A TOUGH ASK FOR A RUNNING BACK WHEN YOU HAVE A LINEBACKER LIKE ROQUAN SMITH COMING ON A BLITZ, CLEAN. BROWN PUSHES HIM OUT. YOU KNEW THE MOTION WITH JA'MARR CHASE GETTING MESSED UP AGAINST STEPHENS THAT JOE BURROW WAS GOING RIGHT THERE. THERE IS THE CHEMISTRY WITH 9 AND 1. AL: BURROW 14 PASSES, COMPLETED NINE. UNDER FOUR MINUTES TO PLAY IN THE QUARTER. BROWN TO THE 40-YARD LINE. IN HIS SECOND YEAR AT OF ILLINOIS. PICKED HIM IN THE FIFTH ROUND. JOE MIXON WAS THE GUY, BROWN WAS MOSS WOULD PROBABLY BE 1 AND BROWN WAS GOING TO BE 1A NOW HE IS 1. KIRK: YOU CAN SEE EVEN TONIGHT THAT LAMAR JACKSON IS WAITING FOR HIS OPPORTUNITY. HAS NOT HAD MUCH AT ALL. 1:29. HE IS 200 10 POUNDS, HAS GREAT VISION. AL: SECOND DOWN AND 3. PLAY FAKE. PASS. GOING DOWN AS THE PASS GOT TO HIM, IOSIVAS, CANNOT PULL THAT ONE IN. IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 3. KIRK: I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WITH CINCINNATI AND JOE BURROW WHEN THEY GET TO NOVEMBER BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENT LOOK IN HIS EYES, IN THE HUDDLE, A DIFFERENT SENSE OF URGENCY. JOE LOOKS LIKE HE IS IN THE ZONE. WE SAW THAT AT LSU WHEN THEY WON THE TITLE IN 2019. SEPTEMBER. KIRK: [LAUGHTER] AL: HISTORICALLY THEY HAVE ME GETTING OFF TOO BAD STARTS. BURROW ESCAPES, THROWS, INCOMPLETE ALONG THE SIDELINE. LOOKING FOR A FLAG, DOES NOT GET ONE. FOURTH DOWN AND 3. KIRK: VAN NOY MADE HIM STEP UP. THEY ARE GETTING PRESSURE WITH FOUR. THAT IS A GREAT MATCHUP AGAINST MIMS, THE ROOKIE. KYLE HAMILTON DOES EVERYTHIN THIS DEFENSE. AL: ALL OVER THE PLACE. MEANWHILE, FROM THE 41, THEY MADE A FOURTH DOWN A TOUCHDOWN EARLIER, COMING OUT FOR A FOURTH AND 3. BURROW, DEEP DROP. BURROW, DOWN THE SIDELINE AND THAT IS INCOMPLETE. THE COVERAGE WAS GOOD COME OF PRESSURE WAS PUT ON. THEY HAND THE BALL BACK TO THE RAVENS AT THE 41 YARD LINE. HIT A 56 YARD FIELD GOAL TO SEND IT INTO OVERTIME AND THEN A SHORT ONE TO WIN IT. KIRK: YOU TEASED ME ABOUT MY SCHEDULE. I USUALLY GO TO THE BENGALS HOME GAMES. REFEREE: FALSE START, OFFENSE, NUMBER 77. FIVE YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN. KIRK: LET'S TAKE A LOOK WHILE WE HAVE A CHANCE AT OUR NEXGEN STATS POWERED BY AWS. DERRICK HENRY HAVING A CAREER A LOT OF PEOPLE WONDERED IF HE STILL HAD THE GOODS. LOOK AT THEM AS A TEAM. THEY LEAD THE LEAGUE IN YARDS AFTER CONTACT. AL: HENRY WILL BE 31 BEFORE THE END OF THE SEASON. IT IS FUNNY BECAUSE HE WANTED TO LEAVE TENNESSEE. WE WERE TALKING TO JOHN HARBAUGH, WHO ARE YOU COMPETING WITH? A LOT OF TEAMS FELT $8 MILLION WAS TOO MUCH MONEY FOR A RUNNING BACK. OF COURSE, THE COWBOY FANS ARE CRAZED THAT THEY DID NOT PICK HIM UP. SECOND DOWN AND 11. JACKSON THROWS. MAKING THE GRAB IS MARK ANDREWS. ANDREWS, THE VICTIM OF A HIP DROP TACKLE IN THIS GAME LAST YEAR AND MISSED THE REST OF THE SEASON, LOOKS BETTER THAN EVER. KIRK: IT IS GREAT TO SEE HIM WHAT A MATCHUP AGAINST THE SAFETY, JORDAN BATTLE. HOW ABOUT LAMAR JACKSON? VERY COMFORTABLE, MOVES AWAY FROM THE PRESSURE. LOOK AT THE TOUCH HE IS THROWING THE FOOTBALL WITH. HE IS NOT JUST THROWING IT WITH EVERYTHING HE HAS. AL: FROM THE 43. THAT PASS IS INCOMPLETE. OUT OF THE REACH OF FLOWERS. WE WERE WATCHING ANDREWS BEFORE THE GAME. HE WAS PRACTICING THAT A HALF HOUR. KIRK: I SAW THAT. WITH SERIOUS INTENT. I THINK WITH LAMAR, LOOK AT THE PIECES AROUND HIM. THE REASON E THE REASON HE IS HAVING ANOTHER MBP YEAR, ANDREWS IS HEALTHY, RASHOD BATEMAN IS HEALTHY, ZAY FLOWERS IS REALLY COMING ALONG. THEY ARE SO MUCH BETTER ON THE EDGE. AL: SECOND DOWN AND 10. JACKSON, OUT OF THE POCKET, ALWAYS DANGEROUS. PROVES IT AGAIN. FIRST DOWN. YOU THINK YOU HAVE HIM, AND YOU DON'T. HE PICKS UP 12 YARDS AND A FIRST. KIRK: YOU ARE IN NO MAN'S LAND AND HE IS IN SHOTGUN AND YOU DO NOT GET PRESSURE. YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO PLASTER THE RECEIVER, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? AL: GOES OUT THE SIDE DOOR. STOPPED AT THE LINE OF THAT IS KEATON MITCHELL. HE HAS BEEN HURT. A FLAG IS THROWN. THEY ACTIVATED MITCHELL TONIGHT. HIS FIRST ACTION OF THE SEASON. KIRK: PRATT DID NOT GET OFF THE FIELD IN TIME. REFEREE: TOO MANY MEN ON THE FIELD, DEFENSE. FIVE-YARD PENALTY. A FIRST DOWN. KIRK: TRYING TO GET ENOUGH PERSONNEL IN. THEY WERE TRYING TO GET GERMAINE PRATT OFF. HE HUSTLED, BUT HE WAS A STEP SHORT. LAMAR SAID, NO, NO, WE GOT HIM. AL: LOU ANARUMO, DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR IN HIS 60 YEAR WITH THAT ROLE WITH -- IN HIS SIXTH YEAR IN THAT ROLE WITH THE BENGALS. GETS AROUND PRATT, TACKLED AFTER A GAIN OF 11. KIRK: YOU LOVE TO SEE THIS. I-FORMATION, OLD SCHOOL THEY WILL RUN THE FOOTBALL ON FIRST DOWN, RIGHT? THE BENGALS HAVE THREE LINEBACKERS IN THE GAME, EXPECTING RUN, TODD MONKEN DOES A GREAT JOB OF BREAKING A TREND. GET HIM ON THE EDGE AND GET HIM A CHANCE TO MAKE THE THROW ON THE RUN. SO DANGEROUS. AL: THE BENGALS WILL LET THE CLOCK RUN OUT. THE FIRST QUARTER WITH THE BENGALS LEADING THE RAVENS EAGLE COMMANDERS. WASHINGTON AT PHILADELPHIA IS THE GAME NEXT THURSDAY NIGHT ON PRIME. JAYDEN DANIELS, HURTS, THE WHOLE THING GOING ON. FIRST AND 10, HENRY GETS THE TOSS, DOWN THE SIDELINE. HE IS PUSHED OUT OF BOUNDS. KIRK: THE WHOLE THING IS CAN HE GET STARTED? CAN HE GET DOWNHILL? THE BENGALS DID A GOOD JOB UNTIL OVERTIME OF BOGGLING HIM WHEN HE DOES GET DOWNHILL, THAT IS WHEN THOSE INFAMOUS STIFF-ARMS COME, SAFETIES AND DEFENSIVE END BACKS. AL: HERE HE IS AGAIN. THAT TIME THE COVERAGE IS VERY NORMALLY HE GETS ROLLING, HE IS LIKE AN 18-WE'LLER ROLLING DOWN -- 18-WHEELER. KIRK: I GET IT EVERY WEEK. THAT TIME IT WAS REALLY WELL PLAYED BY SAM HUBBARD, CONTROLLING THE EDGE. THEY GET LAMAR JACKSON TO THIRD HAVE NOT SEEN ANY OF THE ZONE READ STUFF. THEY KIND OF SPRINKLE IT IN. HE DID NOT RUN THE FOOTBALL MUCH LAST WEEK. HE WAS UNDER CENTER FOR TH PART. AL: ONLY THREE CARRIES. FLOWERS IN MOTION, THIRD AND 4. HE THROWS A DART THAT IS CURRENT -- HE THROWS A DART THAT IS CAUGHT BY HILL. KIRK: A SLIP SCREEN. BY THE WAY, ANOTHER WEAPON. YOU TALK ABOUT HENRY AND THESE OTHER WEAPONS AND YOU GET A THIRD IN HERE COMES 43 INTO THE GAME AND I CANNOT FIND HIM. IT WAS A SIDE ARM FLIP. GET IT TO THE LITTLE MAN, 43. HE IS STRONG AND TOUGH TO BRING AL: FIRST AND GOAL. LAMAR. WIDE OPEN, NELSON AGHOLOR, TOUCHDOWN, BALTIMORE. JACKSON STARTS OUT LIKE HE IS GOING TO RUN IT, YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT. KIRK: THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT THERE IS NO OFFENSE IN THE ENTIRE NFL THAT CHALLENGES YOU WITH THE EYES AS MUCH AS LAMAR JACKSON. MAKING IT LOOK AND FELL LIKE HE IS GOING TO RUN. THE SECONDARY HAS THEIR EYES IN THE BACKFIELD AND THEY LOSE FOCUS ON THE RECEIVER, AGHOLOR, WHO SNEAKS OUT BEHIND THEM. AL: JUSTIN TUCKER TO TRY TO TIE THE GAME, WHICH HE DOES, TWO MINUTES INTO THE SECOND QUARTER. THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL IN 7-7. KICKOFF HERE. TOUCHBACK TO THE 30 YARD LINE AND IT WILL COME. KAYLEE: AFTER EACH WIN, THE RAVENS GIVE OUT WHAT JOHN HARBAUGH GIVES OUT THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS AWARD. AS UNASSUMING AS IT LOOKS, ITS INSPIRATION IS FROM THE NAVY SEALS. HARBAUGH TAKES PRIDE IN RECOGNIZING THE PLAYER WHO DID THE DIRTY WORK TO GET THE JOB DONE. HIS FIRST AND SEVENTH SEASONS, LAMAR JACKSON WAS HYPED TO GET IT AFTER BEATING TAMPA BAY. AL: HERE IS THE DEBUT FOR KHALIL HERBERT. JUST CAME OVER FROM CHICAGO. HE DROPS THE BALL AND RECOVERS IT HIMSELF. THAT IS QUITE A DEBUT. THAT WOULD BE THE DEFINITION OF INAUSPICIOUS. I THINK THAT IS FAIR TO SAY. THE FUMBLE, I THOUGHT HE MIGHT ROLLUP ON ALEX CAPPA. THE BALL IS IN LIKE. YOU SAID, HIS FIRST OPPORTUNITY. THERE IS CAPPA GETTING PUSHED BACK ON TOP OF HIM. THE BALL BACK. AL: SECOND AND 11. BURROW. LOOK OUT. ESCAPES. THROWS. HAD A MAN, CHASE, BUT OVERTHREW IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN 11. ATHLETIC ABILITY. GETS AWAY FROM TWO DEFENDERS WHO HAD HANDS ON HIM. OWEH HAD HIM. HE WAS WRAPPED UP, IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS DOWN. THAT WAS THE HARD PART. THEN HE HAD A WIDE-OPEN JA'MARR CHASE. STILL GETTING PRESSURED AT THE END BY AR'DARIUS WASHINGTON. AL: BURROW NOW 50%, 9-18. FLANKED BY A COUPLE OF TIGHT ENDS IN THE BACKFIELD. THROWS TO ONE OF THEM. FIGHTING HIS WAY TO THE 39 YARD LINE IS TANNER HUDSON. IT WILL BE FOURTH DOWN. HE IS A YARD HAVE GONE FOR IT A COUPLE TIMES KIRK: THE BENGALS WILL PUNT. AL: THE ROOKIE PUNTER IS BRIAN REHKOW, OUT OF BYU. FREE AGENT THEY PICKED HIM UP. VERY HIGH KICK. SKY HIGH. FAIR CAUGHT AT THE 16 YARD LINE BY WALLACE. RAVENS WILL WE COME BACK. HE IS ON HIS WAY TO SURPASSING MICHAEL VICK FOR THE MOST RUSHING YARDS BUT A QUARTERBACK AT AGE 27. HE WILL BE SO FA EVERYONE. NUMBER 79. FIVE YARD PENALTY DOWN. AL: YOU USED TO SAY GRETZKY IN THE RECORD BOOK BUT ALEC BEHIND HIM. KIRK: FRUSTRATED GETTING BEHIND THE STICKS. AL: PLAY FAKE. FLOWERS. COVERED VERY WELL. KIM TAYLOR-BRITT MAKES ANOTHER GOOD PLAY. KIRK: KIM TAYLOR-BRITT -- CAM TAYLOR-BRITT. THIS IS A TOUGH ASKED. GOING INTO THE BOUNDARY. HE GETS AROUND HIM USING HIS QUICKNESS. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE SECONDARY IS LOOKING INTO THE BACKFIELD. AL: A LOSS OF FIVE. SECOND DOWN AND 20. SITES HIS WAY -- FIGHTS HIS WAY. THIRD AND 15. KIRK: YOU CAN HEAR JORDAN BATTLE FIRED UP, THE BACKUP SAFETY, NUMBER 27. HE WENT TO ALABAMA, DERRICK HENRY WENT TO ALABAMA. HE PROBABLY WAITED A LONG TIME TO MAKE THAT HIT ON THE BIG FELLA. THEY CAN GET YOU BEHIND THE STICKS, GIVE THE DEFENSE CONFIDENCE AND HERE YOU ARE AT THIRD AND 15 ON YOUR OWN 11. AL: 10 MINUTES TO GO IN THE OPENING HALF. FIVE WIDE ON THIRD AND 15. QUICK THROW TO FLOWERS. LOOKS FOR ROOM. HE IS ABOUT SIX YARDS BATTLE MAKES THAT TACKLE. KIRK: THIS DEFENSE IS FLYING AROUND. CINCINNATI CAME INTO THIS GAME, DEFENSE HAS NOT BEEN A STRENGTH. HOW DO THE BENGALS WIN THIS GAME? HOW MANY STOPS WILL THEY GET ON LAMAR JACKSON? THEY WILL PRO OUTSCORE HIM. AL: JORDAN STOUT OUT TO PUNT. TRENTON ERWIN SETS UP INSIDE THE 35. HIGH, FLOATING KICK. 34. IRWIN LOOKING FOR ROOM, THERE IS NONE. BACK COME THE BENGALS ON OFFENSE WITH BURROW AL: CINCINNATI TAKING OVER. WITH THE BENGALS, THEY ARE TAKING CARE OF THE BOTTOM FEEDERS. WINS AGAINST TEAMS THAT ARE 8-2 8. AGAINST TEAMS WITH WINNING RECORDS, VERY TOUGH. HERE COMES CHASE BROWN FOR A GAIN OF ABOUT FOUR. KIRK: BACK TO THE EARLIER PART OF THE SHOW, THEY SENSE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BEAT ONE OF THE TOP TEAMS IN THE LEAGUE, ON THE ROAD, ON A SHORT WEEK. COMING OFF A WIN AGAINST THE RAIDERS, OFF TO A SLOW START. HERE THEY ARE AT 4-5, A CHANCE TO GET TO .500 AND 2-1 DIVISION. AL: SECOND AND 7. TIPPED AND INCOMPLETE. THAT TIME, KYLE HAMILTON. THIS GUY PLAYS ALL OVER THE PLACE. HE REMINDS YOU OF HOW PLAYED WITH PITTSBURGH. KIRK: HE IS 6'4". WITH THAT KIND OF LENGTH AND THAT ABILITY TO EXPLODE INTO THE BACKFIELD, THAT IS A NICE JOB OF DISGUISING THAT. LINES UP AGAINST THE TIGHT END, JOE WAS FOOLED. ABLE TO KNOCK THE FOOTBALL DOWN. AL: THIRD AND 7. STRAIGHT DROP. COMES UP. GOING TO RUN IT AND WILL BE TAKEN DOWN JUST SHY OF THE OWEH AND ROQUAN SMITH ARE THER THEY ARE JUSTE. SHY OF THE 40. KIRK: HE IS NOT BLINKING. HE IS SENDING IN THE TIGHT END AND CHASE BROWN. LAST SERIES, THEY WERE CLOSE TO THE SAME SPOT ON THE FIELD. THIS TIME WITH A HALF YARD TO GO, THEY ARE SENDIN OFFENSE. AL: DO THEY REALLY GO FOR IT OR JUST TRY TO DRAW THEM OFF SIDE? PLAY CLOCK AT 5. MEANWHILE. KIRK: SNAPPED IT TO TANNER HUDSON, WHO WENT IN MOTION. AL: THE LIN AND. KIRK: WOW. HOW ABOUT THAT? WOULD YOU SAY THAT IS RISKY? AL: I WOULD SAY. KIRK: WATCH HOW JOE COMMUNICATES TO THE SIDELINE. IS THAT THE CALL? AND THEN THE BALL IS SNAPPED TO ASLEEP. AL: GOOD SNAP BY KARRAS. THEY GAMBLE AND GO GET A FIRST DOWN. BURROW RETREATS, A LITTLE FLOATER. BROWN HAD NO CHANCE. COVERAGE BY MARCUS WILLIAMS. KIRK: THEY ARE PLAYING ZONE HERE, THEIR EYES RIGHT WHERE THEY NEED TO BE. MARCUS WILLIAMS AND POSITION. DOES NOT GET FOOLED. A LITTLE HALF ROLL. WILLIAMS SNIFFED THAT OUT THE ENTIRE TIME. NOW THE BENGALS GO BACKWARD. AL: SECOND AND 15, 6:30 LEFT IN THE HALF. DROPPED. 40 YARD LINE. TANNER HUDSON. A FEW PLAYS AGO HE IS THE HERO. AND THEN A COUPLE PLAYS LATER HE DROPS AN EASY THROW. KIRK: THE BENGALS HAVE PLAYED A LOT OF MULTIPLE TIED NSAIDS WITHOUT TEE HIGGINS -- A LOT OF MULTIPLE TIGHT END SETS. IT IS IMPACTING HOW THIS OFFENSE CAN ATTACK. THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO MOVE HUDSON AND GESICKI INTO THIS GAME. AL: THEY HAVE TO GET TO THE 49 OF BALTIMORE. BURROW ROLLING AGAINST THE GRAIN. HE IS TAKEN DOWN. HE DOES NOTHING, THEY WILL PUNT. MADUBUIKE CHASES HIM DOWN. FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: THIS IS THE GUY THEY ARE WAITING TO BECOME MORE VIOLENT IN THE PAST GAME. PRETTY GOOD SPEED. IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF HOW WELL HE CAN RUN FOR A 305-POUND A -- MAN. THE BALL GETS NOT LOOSE, GOES OUT OF BOUNDS. AL: REHKOW TO KICK AGAIN. WALLACE CALLS FOR A FAIR CATCH. AND MAKES IT THAT THE 20 YARD WHO HAVE SUPPORTED THE TEAM SINCE IT CAME TO BALTIMORE IN 1996. TUCKER TOLD ME IT PUTS THE PERSPECTIVE. AL: HE MIGHT WIND UP IN THE HALL OF FAME SO THE GUYS WILL BE IN CANTON FOR THAT INDUCTION. FROM THE 20 YARD LINE. NOT ABLE TO GET ON TRACK TONIGHT. DERRICK HENRY HAS CARRIED THE BALL SIX TIMES FOR 22 YARDS AND THE DEFENSE WILL TAKE THAT. KIRK: THEY DO A GOOD JOB OF SETTING THE EDGE. WHEN YOU RUN LEFT YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE OF TREY HENDRICKSON. WHEN HE AND RONNIE STANLEY GO HEAD TO HEAD, THIS LAST WEEK, FOUR SACKS. HE LEADS THE ENTIRE NFL WITH 11 SACKS. AL: HE HAS 11 OF THEIR 17. QUICK THROW. A FIVE YARD GAIN. KIRK: WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THIS. RONNIE STANLEY IS BACK HEALTHY, HAVING AS GOOD OF A YEAR AT LEFT TACKLE AS ANYONE. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO CHIP, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PUT A TIGHT END OVER BALL IS GETTING OUT PRETTY QUICK. RONNIE STANLEY IS HOLDING HIS OWN AGAINST THE NUMBER 1 SACK MAN IN THE NFL. AL: ON A THIRD AND 5. DEEP DOWN THE LEFT SIDE, TWO RAVENS ARE THERE AND IT IS BROKEN UP. DJ TURNER BREAKING IT UP. KIRK: THAT BALL FLOATED A LITTLE BIT. THE GREATEST ASSET THE DJ TURNER HAS IS HIS SPEED. HE IS A 4.2 GUY. THIS BALL COMES OUT A LITTLE BIT LATE. LAMAR FLOATS IT. WATCH TURNER CATCH UP TO THE REALLY GOOD PLAY ON THIRD DOWN. I DO NOT KNOW IF HE SAW THE BALL BUT HE KNOCKED IT AWAY. AL: MEANWHILE, FOR STOUT, HIS THIRD PUNT OF THE NIGHT. THAT ONE IS OUT OF BOUNDS AT ABOUT THE 27 YARD LINE. AL: IN THAT WILD SHOOTOUT THEY HAD A MONTH AGO IN CINCINNATI, IT WAS 17-14, BENGALS, AT THE HALF. TONIGHT A DIFFERENT STORY, SO FAR. 4:02 TO GO IN THE FIRST HALF. BURROW HANDS THE BALL OFF. A GAIN OF ONE. CHASE BROWN HAS BEEN BUSY. HE HAD 27 CARRIES LAST SUNDAY. MEANWHILE, THERE GOES JACKSON. WHAT DO WE CALL IT? A POTTY BREAK? YOU CAN CALL IT THAT. KYLE HAMILTON WALKED UP IN THE BOX, PLAYING THAT DIME LINEBACKER SPOT. AL: SECOND AND 10. BURROW STEPPING UP, THROWS ON THE RUN AND THAT WILL BE HAULED IN FOR THE FIRST DOWN. GESICKI COMING OFF HIS BEST GAME AS A CINCINNATI BENGAL. HERE COMES LAMAR. KIRK: GOOD TO SEE HIM COME BACK. JOE BURROW CLIMBING THE POCKET, GESICKI IS RIGHT OVER THERE. WATCH HOW HE FEELS THE PRESSURE. WATCH GESICKI COME BACK TO THE THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT BALL GETTING KNOCKED DOWN AND A COMPLETION. LOOK AT BURROW MAKING THAT THROW. AL: FROM THE 40 YARD LINE. BROWN SHOVES HIS WAY FOR A GAI OF FIVE. KIRK: HE HAS BEEN UNDER PRESSURE THROUGHOUT HIS ENTIRE CAREER, SINCE HE HAS BEEN IN CINCINNATI. HE HAS A LINEBACKER MENTALITY. HIS FATHER, A DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL. HIS BROTHER PLAYED LINEBACKER AT NEBRASKA. IT IS HIM STEPPING UP AND MANEUVERING, EYES DOWNFIELD, LOOKING FOR A CHANCE. JUST HAD A NICE ONE TO GESICKI. HE HAS A FEEL INSIDE THE POCKET AS GOOD AS ANYONE IN THE LEAGUE. AL: YOU SAW HAMILTON COME UP TO THE LINE. GOES BACK INTO COVERAGE. SECOND DOWN AND 6. A NICE MOVE BY TANNER HUDSON TO PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN. THAT TAKES US TO THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING. THAT MUCH TIME LEFT IN THE HALF, I LEFT EARLY. I HAD TO. HALFTIME SHOW COMING UP. TWO MINUTES TO THE HALF KIRK: PIPE OR PRESSURED -- PIPER GETTING PRESSURED. THERE'S THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN CHASE AND JOE BURROW, ABLE TO WORK THAT AROUND WRITTEN SIMPSON. HE'S GETTING HIS ARMS STILL HAS ENOUGH ON IT TO GET THE BALL THERE FOR THE FIRST AL: BENGALS OF TWO TIMEOUTS. RUSHED FOR, OPEN, 30 YARD LINE, FIRST DOWN AND A FEW MORE. KIRK: KYLE HAMILTON THERE, YOU KNOW, YOU SAW BROWN MAKE A MOVE. HE WENT DOWN IMMEDIATELY. ONE OF THE TOP DEFENDERS IN THE LEAGUE LET ALONE ON THIS RAVENS DEFENSE. HE IS SITTING OUT THERE IN THE ZONE WITH GESICKI. HE WILL STARTS WANT TO REACT TO CHASE BROWN AND, BOY, YOU CAN SEE THE RIGHT LEG, THE RIGHT FOOT. AL: SO KYLE HAMILTON GETS UP, HOBBLES TO THE SIDELINE, AND HERE' HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE HE STEPPED ON GESICKI. THE RIGHT FOOT, A LITTLE BIT OF A TWIST AFTER HE STEPPED ON IT, SO HE GOES INTO THE TENT. AL: THAT COMES WITH 69 SECONDS UNTIL HALFTIME. YOU HAVE WATSON COMING IN THAT ROLE SO TO SPEAK. MEANWHILE BURROWED TO THE END. AND COMPLETE. GESICKI GOING UP IN THE AIR. START. AL: HE DID. SHOT OUT OF A CAUGHT HIM. >> OFFSIDE, DEFENSE, NUMBER 99. KIRK: THE RIGHT GUARD GIVES THAT SIGNAL THAT THE OFFENSIVE LINE IS READY, AND HE JUMPED IT, KIND OF ANTICIPATING THE CENTER WOULD SNAP THE FOOTBALL THAT MOVEMENT AND HE JUST GOT OUT A LITTLE BIT EARLY. I THINK BOROUGH FELT THAT, GOT THAT JUMP, TRYING TO SQUEEZE IN AN. GIVES THE FIVE YARD PENALTY. >> FIRST AND 5. SERVING TO THE END ZONE. AND STEVENS WITH THE PICK. THEY GO GESICKI'S WAY AND THROWS ONLY HIS FIFTH INTERCEPTION OF THE SEASON. KIRK: THIS GOES TO SHOW YOU EVEN THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS CAN SOMETIMES GET CAUGHT. WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WITH JOE YOU SEE HIM SINKING STEPHENS? HE THINKS HE HAS MAN-TO-MAN COVERAGE AND A CHANCE TO GO OVER TOP OF HIM BUT INSTEAD HE ENDS UP SINKING BACK AND FOOLED JOE YOU HAVE TO GIVE STEPHENS OF CREDIT FOR THAT ONE. AL: SO THE PLAY IS UNDER REVIEW. THE QUESTION IS DOES HE STAY IN BOUNDS AFTER THE PICK? WELL, PRETTY INTERESTING. BACK AFTER THIS. >> AFTER REVIEW, THE RULING ON THE FIELD IS AN INCOMPLETE PASS. SECOND DOWN FROM THE PREVIOUS 5. AL: HERE IS THE SITUATION. BEFORE THE LEFT FOOT GETS DOWN, THE RIGHT FOOT IS OUT OF BOUNDS. THAT IS THE RULING. KIRK: THE TOW GOT DOWN BUT AS THE FOOT CONTINUED TO SLIDE, THE OUTSIDE OF THE TOE HIT THE WHITE BEFORE THE LEFT FOOT GOT DOWN. AL: CINCINNATI WITH A BALL, SECOND DOWN AND 5 NOW. BURROW, PRESSURED, UP FROM BEHIND. HE'S TAKEN DOWN. THE CLOCK CONTINUES TO RUN. THEY HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS. THEY ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT KIRK: NOW HE CALLS A TIMEOUT, BEING RESPECTFUL OF LAMAR JACKSON IN THE RAVENS OFFENSE. CREDIT TO THIS DEFENSIVE FRONT. AGAIN, THAT IS THE GUY THEY HAVE BEEN WAITING TO SEE. HE HAS BEEN A FORCE CHASING DOWN JOE BURROW TONIGHT. >> OUT OF TEXAS ANAM, FOR FEAR. AT A GREAT YEAR LAST YEAR. KIRK: THE FOURTH DOWN ON THE OPENING DRIVE, DEFENSIVE HOLDING ON FOURTH DOWN INSIDE THE 5, GAVE HIM A CHANCE TOGETHER TOUCHDOWN. NOW THEY HAVE IT OVERRULED WITH THE INTERCEPTION SO ANOTHER CHANCE TO CAPITALIZE ON A BREAK. AL: 44 SECONDS. BURROW FIRES, OVER THE MIDDLE, CAUGHT, AND THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT A FIRST DOWN AND GOAL, TANNER HUDSON. THAT'S ACTUALLY JERMAINE BURTON WHO MAKES THE CATCH. BURTON MAKES THE CATCH, HIS FIRST GRAB OF THE NIGHT. THERE'S THE ROOKIE MATCHED UP AGAINST STEPHENS. BURTON. THERE'S NEVER A QUESTION ABOUT JERMAINE BURTON'S ABILITY ON THE FAR LEFT TO PRESS COVERAGE, SEPARATION. CONFIDENCE JOE BURROW HAS IN THAT BALL WAS OUT BEFORE HE MADE THIS CUT AND THE YOUNG ROOKIE DELIVERS IN THE CLUTCH HERE AND END ZONE. AL: SO IT'S GOING TO BE FIRST EACH TEAM IS OUT OF TIMEOUTS RIGHT NOW. SO EITHER BALTIMORE GETS THE BALL. NO TIMEOUTS TO WORK WITH. MEANWHILE, CINCINNATI TRYING TO TAKE THE LEAD BEFORE THE HALF. 36 SECONDS. KIRK: CHASE BY HIM LEFT, SAFETY OVERTOP. AL: BURROW LOOKS THAT WAY. IN THE END ZONE. ADVANTAGE, TANNER HUDSON. SO HUDSON, WHO TOOK THAT SNAP FROM CENTER AND MADE IT, MAKING HIS PRESENCE VERY MUCH FELT. KIRK: WHAT A JOB AS YOU WOULD EXPECT. GIVE THE OFFENSIVE LINE CREDIT BECAUSE JOE BURROW LOOKS LEFT TO JA'MARR CHASE. HE ENDS UP BEING DOUBLE ONCE HE HAS TO GET AWAY FROM THE TROUBLE AND FINES HUDSON, HAD SAT DOWN FROM THE TOUCHDOWN. AL: SO 73 YARDS TOOK THEM 3.5. MCPHERSON NOW FOR THE EXTRA AND THE BENGALS GO UP BY A SCORE OF 14-7. KIRK: MARCUS WILLIAMS ENDS UP DOUBLING JA'MARR CHASE. HIS BODY WILL TURN. THEY ARE JUST KIND OF BRACKETING LOOK AT JOE'S EYES. HE'S LOOKING LEFT. WATCH OUT HUDSON SITS IN THAT SOFT SPOT OF THE ZONE. HE IS SQUARING UP TO BURROW AND JUST SETTLING IN. A YARD OR TWO INSIDE THE GOAL LINE, MAKES IT AN EASY TARGET. SOMEHOW THE RAVENS DEFENSE LOST HIM, MISCOMMUNICATED, AL: SECOND CAREER TOUCHDOWN CATCH FOR HUDSON, WHO HAS BEEN IN THE LEAGUE FOR FIVE SEASONS. IT WAS ACTUALLY ON THE TAMPA BAY ROSTER BACK IN 2020 WHEN THEY WON THE SUPER BOWL. 14-7. BURROW CHECKING OUT THE TABLET. WHO KNOWS? KIRK: YOU NEVER KNOW. AL: HE'S A PERFECTIONIST AS WE MENTIONED. KIRK: TALK ABOUT HOW ZAC TAYLOR WAITED. LET THE CLOCK RUN A LITTLE BIT. JUST IN CASE YOU END UP PUTTING A TOUCHDOWN ON THE BOARD, YOU DON'T WANT TO GET BALTIMORE AND LAMAR JACKSON ANYTIME. THEY END UP GIVING HIM 30 SECONDS. AL: 30 AND NO TIMEOUTS. KAYLEE: THE BENGALS GOT THE END ZONE THERE WHILE THE RAVENS JACK OF ALL TRADES DEFENSIVE BACK KYLE HAMILTON WAS IN THE X-RAY ROOM. FIELD, NOT ABLE TO PUT MUCH WEIGHT ON HIS LEG. HE'S QUESTIONABLE TO RETURN. AL: HUGE LOSS IF HE CANNOT COME KIRK: HE DOES EVERYTHING. HE AFFECTS THE ENTIRE DEFENSE BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY USE HIM. BACK IN THE SAFETY SPOT. YOU WILL HAVE TO USE TWO OR THREE DEFENDERS TO REPLACE ONE GUY. AL: IF THEY CAN PICK UP ENOUGH OF A TRUMPCARE TO SET UP OF A CHUNK HERE -- ENOUGH OF A CHUNK HERE TO SET UP TUCKER. IT TAKES ONLY FOUR SECONDS OFF THE CLOCK. SECOND AND 7. SO JACKSON RIGHT, 8-11, 51 YARDS, ONLY CARRIED THE BALL ONE TIME TONIGHT. THEY WANT TO RUN THE BALL EIGHT TIMES, 31 YARDS. KIRK: WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THIS DEFENSE, THE WAY THEY PLAY. THEIR OWN OFFENSE HAS KEPT LAMAR ON THE SIDELINE BUT 51 YARDS PASSING? AL: 2:1 TIME OF POSSESSION. KEEPING JACKSON ON THE BENCH. FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE. THIRD DOWN AND 7. CINCINNATI, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE DEFENSE. ONE OF THEM WAS HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER. A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT HE WOULD BE A HEAD COACH. HE GOT SOME INTERVIEWS. HE WENT FROM ONE OF THE HOT ASSISTANCE TO A GUY UNDER THE GUN BECAUSE THE CINCINNATI AS PEOPLE WOULD EXPECT. KIRK: ONE OF THE TOP ASSISTANCE OUT THERE. HE'S DONE A HECKUVA JOB. HE'S GETTING THE DIALED IN TONIGHT BUT DEAFENING DID A COUPLE YEARS AGO. CLOSE ONE. ANDREWS GETS OUT OF BOUNDS. AND YOU HAVE A FLAG DOWN. STILL OUTSIDE OF FIELD GOAL RANGE. WE WILL SEE ABOUT THE PENALTY. >> HOLDING, DEFENSE, NUMBER 57. PENALTY DECLINED. AL: THEY WILL TAKE THE PLAY, WHICH IS 14 YARDS. SO NOW YOU ARE AT THE 47. FOR JUSTIN TUCKER, YOU KNOW, THE SKY IS THE LIMIT, NOT NECESSARILY THE WAY IT USED TO BE. HE'S HAD SOME ISSUES HERE WITH 50 YARD FIELD GOALS AND BEYOND. KIRK: HOW MUCH DO THEY WISH THEY HAD THOSE TWO TIMEOUTS THEY NEEDED TO USE? THEY ENDED UP HAVING 12 MEN ON THE FIELD. LET OPENING DRIVE ON DEFENSE, THEY BURNED TWO. AL: RIGHT. SO YOU HAVE TO WORK THE OUTSIDE. IF YOU WANT TO FLING A HAIL MARY. THEY WORK THE MIDDLE BUT THE TACKLE WAS MADE. DYONTAE JOHNSON RIPS THE BAL THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD BUT NOT ENOUGH TIME. THAT IS THE END OF IT. KIRK: YEAH. THE NICKEL MAKES A HECKUVA PLAY IN SPACE. THAT WAS A RACE TO SEE WHO WAS GOING TO GET THERE. HE GOT JOHNSON BEFORE HE COULD GET OUT OF BOUNDS. FLOWERS TRIED TO MAKE THE BLOCK. HECKUVA JOB BY THE VETERAN. AL: SO IT IS 14-7, BENGALS. KAYLEE: ZAC, YOUR OFFENSE HAS CONTROL A TON OF POSSESSIONS 2: 1. HALF? >> KEEP POSSESSING THE BALL. US BACK. WE -- OUR DEFENSE DID A GREAT JOB FINISHING THE HALF. KAYLEE: WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF TIME RAVENS OFFENSE CAN EVEN BE ON THE FIELD, YOU STILL HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BOTTL DERRICK HENRY WHEN THEY HAD THEIR CHANCES. >> DEFENSE IS A BIG PART OF THEY HAVE DO THIS POINT. KIRK: IF YOU TOLD HIM BEFORE THIS GAME STARTED HE WOULD HAVE AL: THE RAVENS ONLY HAVE 102 YARDS PERIOD. SO THE RAVENS WILL GET THE BALL AS WE START THE SECOND HALF, OPENING GAME WITH 10, TOUCHBACK MOMENTS AGO. KAYLEE WITH JOHN HARBAUGH. KAYLEE: CINCINNATI CONTROLLED THE BALL. HOW DO YOU GET FIELD? >> WE HAVE TO GET THEM OFF ON THIRD DOWN SO FAR. A LITTLE TOO MUCH JOE SCRAMBLING. WE HAVE TO KEEP HIM IN. KAYLEE: YOUR OFFENSE ONLY HAVE ONE DRIVE LON PLAYS. HOW DO YOU SUSTAIN THEM? >> IT'S BEEN HURTING US. FIRST DRIVE. AL: INTERESTING BECAUSE LAST WEEK THE RAVENS SCORED ON SEVEN CONSECUTIVE DRIVES. TONIGHT A DIFFERENT STORY. MEANWHILE, THIS WAS GOING TO BE SEVENTH. INSTEAD IT IS JACKSON. AND A FLAG IS DOWN. BLANK MEN IS OUR REFEREE. >> HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER 77. AL: DANIEL. >> THAT'S A FRU CALL NOT JUST TO START THE HALF BUT IT WAS UNNECESSARY. LAMAR JACKSON WAS ALREADY WAY FROM B.J. HILL AND THE BIG FELLOW. BY THE WAY, HE' BY THE WAY, HE'S 410. PLAYED TACKLE IN COLLEGE AND NOW GUARD. AL: 410 THOUGH THEY LIST HIM AT 380. I BELIEVE YOU. UNDER PRESSURE. GETS AWAY. SURVEYING, RUNNING IT. THERE HE GOES. IT GETS BACK TO THE 20 YARD LINE AFTER ALL THAT. KIRK: WHEN HE CAME OUTSIDE OF B.J. HILL, I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, A HEALTHY LAMAR JACKSON TAKES OFF AND GETS SOME YARDS BUT, YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT RUNNING THE BALL AS MUCH THESE LAST COUPLE WEEKS. THERE'S YARDS THERE TO TAKE. GOOD JOB BY THE BENGALS. ANYTIME LAMAR JACKSON GETS OUT, HE TAKES THAT OFF, GETS DOWN THE RIGHT SIDELINE. HUGE YARDS BUT INSTEAD WE TOLD YOU A LITTLE WITH. AL: RUNS AROUND 35 TO GET ONE. SECOND AND 19. GOOD PROTECTION. FIRES AND THE RECEIVER FALLS DOWN, SO THAT TIME, DYONTAE JOHNSON -- A COUPLE YEARS AGO, HE'S THE NUMBER ONE RECEIVER IN PITTSBURGH, GOES TO CAROLINA, CANNOT WAIT TO GET OUT OF THERE. SECOND GAME N UNIFORM. KIRK: HE'S TRYING TO ADJUST HERE. HE STARTS TO RUN HIS ROUTE AND NOW HE SEES YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND THE OPEN SPOT. HE JUST LOSES HIS FOOTING THERE. THAT'S FIRST DOWN. AL: THIRD AND 19. THREE-MAN RUSH, FLAG, CAUGHT AT THE 25 AFTER THE 31 GOES TYLAN WALLACE. >> ILLEGAL FORMATION, OFFENSE, NUMBER 70, FIVE YARD PENALTY, REPLAY THIRD DOWN. KIRK: THOSE TACKLES, THEY GET BACK, A LITTLE TOO MUCH DEPTH. THAT'S WHY THEY ENDED UP CALLING IT IS JUST THE OPERATION OF IT. THAT MAKES SENSE. THEY WILL DECLINE IT. BUT THE OPERATION OF THIS HAS TO BE FRUSTRATING JOHN HARBAUGH. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU HAVE WATCHED A LOT OF RAVENS TONIGHT. IT'S NOT THE WAY I MEAN, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT AN OFFENSE ON PACE TO BE ONE OF THE BEST OFFENSES IN THE HISTORY OF THE NFL, AVERAGING 7.13 YARDS PER PLAY THROUGH THE FIRST NINE WEEKS. THAT'S SECOND BEST IN THE HISTORY OF THE NFL, AND TONIGHT, A COMBINATION OF BEING OUT OF SYNC AND THE BENGALS LOT OF CREDIT FOR THE WAY THEY ARE PLAYING TONIGHT. AL: FOURTH PUNT OF THE NIGHT. SHORT KICK, CLEAR PAST. CALLED AT THE 33. YOU MAKE A GREAT POINT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GO BACK, YOU KNOW, LIKE THE GREATEST SHOW ON TURF, THE RAMS BACK IN 2000 AND WHAT THEY WERE DOING. OF COURSE, MARSHALL FOUGHT, KURT WARNER, ISAAC BRUCE. YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE RAVENS THAT ARE A TEAM THAT CAME IN SECOND IN TOTAL YARDAGE. KIRK: REALLY EVERY ASPECT, THIRD DOWN, YOU KNOW, PASSING, RUSHING, SO BALANCED, SO EXPLOSIVE, BUT TONIGHT, NOT HAVE THEY NOT BEEN ON THE FIELD A LOT BUT THEY HAVE BEEN BEHIND THAT LAST ONE THIRD AND 19. IT KNO FOUND THEIR RHYTHM. AL: AVERAGING 4.5 YARDS PER BURROW FIRES, CAUGHT. THEY WILL CHASE HIM DOWN AND THEY CANNOT. >> HOW SPECIAL IS HE WHEN HE GETS OUT IN THE OPEN FIELD. 67 YARDS FOR JA'MARR CHASE ON THEIR FIRST PLAY OF THE SECOND HALF AND THE RAVENS ARE PUT IN A TWO TOUCHDOWN WHOLE. KIRK: WATCH THE LINEBACKER PLAY, AND IT'S BEEN A WEAKNESS OF THIS BALTIMORE DEFENSE. GREAT JOB FROM A TIMING STANDPOINT AND THIS IS JUST NEXT LEVEL, PROBABLY BEST IN THE LEAGUE. THE RUNNING BACK STILL SAID TO PULL AWAY FROM THE RAVENS. HE DID IT IN WEEK FIVE AND CINCINNATI, DOES IT AGAIN HERE ON A THURSDAY BENGALS UP BY A COUPLE. AL: THAT'S EIGHT RECEIVING TOUCHDOWNS FOR CHASE. AL: WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT ALL DAY FOR NEXT THURSDAY. JAYDEN DANIELS, OUR FIRST LOOK AT HIM FOR A STORY THE PANTHERS HAVE BEEN THE SEASON -- THIS SEASON. JALEN HURTS IN THE EAGLES. PHIL LEAFY -- PHILADELPHIA NEXT WEEK, 8:15 P.M. EASTERN KICKOFF. SO A 14-POINT LEAD, AND AFTER HESITATING, NICK'S HESITATING, NICKX WILL COME OUT THE END ZONE. KIRK: JOE BURROW HAS BEEN FOCUSED AND LOCKED IN. WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY HERE. STEPS UP AGAIN, READS THE COVERAGE, SOFT SPOT, PUTS IT OUT IN FRONT OF JA'MARR CHASE, AND NOW IT IS AGAIN A FOOT RACE FOR THIS DEFENSE DOES NOT HAVE KYLE HAMILTON, ONE OF THE LEADERS ON THE BACK END, AND MAKES THEM PAY FOR IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF FUN SOME JEWELRY. UP THE MIDDLE GOES DEREK. HE HAD BEEN BOTTLED UP TONIGHT. MAKES OF FOUR YARDS THERE. HENRY HAS NO CARRIED SEVEN TIMES, 26 YARDS. KIRK: THEIR FIRST MATCHUP, THEY WERE DETERMINED TO STOP HIM AND HIS ABILITY TO RUN THE FOOTBALL. THEY LOADED UP. YOU ONLY HAVE THAT 41 YARDS UNTIL THEY GET INTO OVERTIME. AL: LONGEST RUN TONIGHT, SEVEN YARDS. AND THEY STOP HIM AGAIN. THIRD DOWN. KIRK: THAT BIG HIT WITH LOGAN WILSON. THIS DEFENSE, MAN, THEY ARE LOCKED IN, AND THE BETTER JOE BURROW PLAYS, THE CONFIDENCE THEY PLAY ON THEIR SIDE OF THE FOOTBALL, THE ROOKIE, MCKINNLEY JACKSON, TRYING TO HOLD THE POINT. NOT A LOT OF ROOM IN THE INTERIOR. THERE'S A BIG HIT BY 55, THE LEADER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DEFENSE, LOGAN WILSON. AL: THIRD AND FOUR. JACKSON, PRESSURES. HE RUNS OUT FROM BEHIND, TAKES THE PASS AND IT'S CAUGHT, BATEMAN, FIRST DOWN. THAT TIME HENDRICKSON ALMOST PICKED UP HIS 12TH SACK OF THE KIRK: THE BALL HAS BEEN GETTING OUT SO QUICKLY HE HAS NOT HAD MUCH OF A CHANCE TO GET AFTER THE QUARTERBACK. THERE'S THAT BEEN, THE LENGTH -- THAT BEND, THE LENGTH COMING EXTENDS AND JUST MISSES IT. GETS HIS RIGHT HAND ON THE LEG BUT LAMAR JACKSON, NOT JUST THE ATHLETIC ABILITY BUT THE EYES LOCATE THE RECEIVER FOR THAT AL: FLOWERS. TO THE 50 YARD LINE. WE GO TO KAYLEE. KAYLEE: THE RAVENS DID NOT WANT TO HEAR KYLE HAMILTON WILL NOT RETURN TO THIS GAME. THAT ANKLE INJURY OFFICIALLY. AL: MM. THE ONLY GOOD NEWS WOULD BE HE'S GOT THREE EXTRA NEXT GAME. >> OFFENSE, NUMBER 65, 5-YARD PENALTY. AL: PATRICK AND CARRIE -- PATRICK MEKARI WAS ILLEGALLY KIRK: THAT'S EITHER A RUN OR A PASS AND THAT HESITATION BECAUSE HE HAD TO PUMP THAT, THE OFFENSIVE LINEMAN, WITHOUT THE BALL GETTING OUT QUICKLY AND IT'S ANOTHER SECOND WHERE THEY GET ANOTHER YARD OR TWO DOWNFIELD SO THAT'S WHY THEY BROUGHT THAT ONE BACK. AL: FIVE WIDE. FIRST AND 15. JACKSON CANNOT GET HIM THAT TIME. THEY GET THE BALL AWAY. SECOND DOWN. JOSEPH ACAI THAT TIME PUT THE HEAT ON IT. KIRK: YOU HAVE TO COLLAPSE THE POCKET TO GET TO JACKSON. YOU CANNOT GO UP FIELD BECAUSE THAT CREATES LANES FOR HIM TO STEP UP IN AN THAT TIME THEY A GOOD JOB AS A FOURSOME OF JUST KIND OF SQUEEZING THEM. ONCE AGAIN, THE RAVENS WITH THAT PENALTY, THAT THEME TONIGHT, THEY ARE THE STICKS YET AGAIN. AL: THERE'S BURROW, WHO HAS THROWN FOR 228 TONIGHT. JACKSON IS 91 ON 18 ATTEMPTS. HE WILL KEEP IT. AND GET UPENDED AT THE 42 YARD SO IT IS THIRD DOWN AND LONG. LAMAR, ONLY HIS THIR THE NIGHT. KIRK: TODD MONK AND IN HIS SECOND YEAR AS AN OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. WE TALKED ABOUT THE NUMBERS AND THE JOB THEY ARE DOING. TONIGHT, THEY ARE TRYING TO FIND SOME ANSWERS. A BIG PART OF THAT WOULD BE NOT SELF-DESTRUCTING. SEVEN PENALTIES ON THE NIGHT. A LOT OF THE TIMES, AGAIN, IT'S PUTTING THEM BACK BEHIND, MAKING THEM PLAY CATCH UP ON THIR AL: HIS DEFENSE DOING YEOMAN WORK TONIGHT, THIRD DOWN AND 11. DEEP, DEEP DROP, PRESSURED AGAIN, ALL THE WAY BACK, AND JUST PUTS IT AWAY, CAUGHT, TAKEN TO THE 26 YARD LINE. WELL, A SOUND YOU DON'T HEAR OFTEN THESE DAYS AT THIS STADIUM. THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON HERE. THIS IS A TEAM THAT THREE TIMES THIS -- WHATEVER. THREE TIMES THIS YEAR, THIS IS A TEAM THAT HAS SCORED 41 POINTS IN THREE GAMES. TONIGHT, SEVEN POINTS, NOTHING GOING. CINCINNATI HAS BOTTLED THEM OUT. MEANTIME, STOUT IS MAKING HIS FIFTH PUNT OF THE NIGHT. TAKEN TO THE 16. THERE'S A FLAG. TO THE 17. IT'S A ONE RUNNING IT BACK -- IT'S A ERWIN RUNNING IT KIRK: LETTING THESE GUYS KNOW THEY ARE STILL PLAYING GOOD A CHALLENGE ANYTIME Y AGAINST LAMAR JACKSON BUT THEY HAVE MET THE CHALLENGE SO FAR. AL: ON THE ROAD ON THREE DAYS' REST. >> AT LEAST HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL LINE, FIRST DOWN. AL: 8:58 LEFT IN THE THIRD. THE BENGALS ARE ON TOP. ING THE BEST BALL OF HIS CAREER, HE MAY JUST BE GETTING STARTED. AL: HE HAS ALREADY THROWN FOR 2:28 TONIGHT. A FEW MORE HERE ON A PASS OUT TO THE 13 YARD LINE TO TANNER HUDSON, SECOND AND FIVE. KIRK: ENDED THAT DRIVE WHEN JACKSON CAME OFF THE FIELD. HE GOT HIT BY A BUNCH OF BENGALS PLAYERS. HE W ON THE SIDELINE, TALK TO THE TRAINERS, FLEXING THAT RIGHT HAND, THAT THROWING HAND COME AL: THE BACKUP IS JOSH JOHNSON, WHO HAS BEEN AROUND SO LONG HE HAS PLAYED WITH 14 TIMES. THE RYAN FITZPATRICK OF HIS ERA. SECOND AND 6. BURROW DUMPS IT OFF, DROPPED, AND IT'S INCOMPLETE. THEY NEVER HAD CONTROL OF IT. THIRD DOWN AND 6. KIRK: JOE HAS DONE A GOOD JOB OF MIXING UP THOSE QUICK UNDERNEATH THROWS AGAINST HIS OWN DEFENSE AND GETTING THOSE EYES TO THE LINEBACKERS AND SAFETIES. WE SAW THAT WITH CHASE ON THAT LONG TOUCHDOWN SO WHICHEVER DIRECTION THEY TAKE AWAY, HE'S ABOVE IT. GOING TO RESET THE PLAY CLOCK. KIRK: IT'S RESET AT 25. BRINGS THEM BACK INTO THE HUDDLE, THIRD AND 6. KIRK: JA'MARR CHASE SO FAR THIS YEAR AGAINST THE RAVENS, 15 RECEPTIONS, 300 12 YARDS AND THREE TOUCHDOWNS. YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK HIM UP. AL: INTO THE BACKFIELD. GOES TO TANNER HUDSON. TANNER HUDSON, HE TOOK THAT SNAP, PULLED IT OVER. HE HAS BEEN ONE OF JOURNEYMEN GUYS, HAVING A HECKUVA NIGHT. KIRK: THEY LINE HIM JA'MARR CHASE, LET HIM GET DOWNFIELD. UNDERNEATH ZONE COVERAGE FOR THE RAVENS, A MAJOR PROBLEM BURROW JUST CAPITALIZING ON THAT SPACE. AL: HUDSON HAS CAUGHT SIX ON SEVEN TARGETS. AND AFTER THE 27 YARD LINE GOES CHASE BROWN. 27 CARRIES, 10 TONIGHT FOR 34 THEY ALSO GAVE HIM SOME BACKUP HELP WITH HERBERT. HE FUMBLED THE LAST TIME WE SAW SECOND AND 5. THE BALL IS OUT. RAVENS HAVE IT. THEY DO. KNOCKED AWAY BY MARLON HUMPHREY. HE CREATED IT AND THEN ROADBLOCK SMITH, NUMBER ZERO, COMES AWAY WITH IT. KIRK: THE LEADERS, MARLON HUMPHREY AND ROQUAN SMITH, THEY HAVE TO MAKE A PLAY, AND YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE RIPPING THE GREAT JOB FOR HUMPHREY, DOING EXACTLY WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO, ATTACK THE FOOTBALL, AND THE VETERAN, ROQUAN SMITH, SEES IT THINK IT'S ON TOP OF IT. THAT'S A FREE BALL, ANYBODY'S IT BOUNCES FOR THE RAVENS. THEY GIVE JACKSON GREAT FIELD POSITION. AL: EXACTLY WHAT BALTIMORE NEEDED. LESS THAN SEVEN MINUTES TO GO IN THE THIRD. SO AFTER FLEXING HIS HAND ON THE BENCH FIRES. THAT WILL BE AN EIGHT YARD GAIN FOR BATEMAN. KAYLEE: IT LOOKS LIKE THE RAVENS HEAD ATHLETIC TRAINER WAS EXAMINING THE BACK OF LAMAR'S RIGHT THROWING HAND AND HIS WRIST BUT THE HE LEFT -- THE SECOND HE LEFT HIS SIDE HE GAVE HIM A HANDSHAKE AND HE DIDN'T FLINCH. THAT LOOKS LIKE A GOOD ME HE HAD SHAKEN IT OFF. AL: THAT'S A HECKUVA CATCH. SECOND AND 2. TO THE 12 YARD LINE. HIS BEST GAIN OF THE NIGHT. THERE HE GOES AGAIN. A PASSEL OF WHITE SHIRTS IS THERE TO GREET HIM. 10 CARRIES, 40 YARDS FOR HENRY SECOND AND 9. GOT TO GO BACK TO THE END OF THE 2021 SEASON, LARGEST DEFICIT IN A HOME GAME. JUSTICE HILL IN THE BACKFIELD. SENDING THEM OUT TO THE RIGHT. JACKSON BACKING UP, BACKING AWAY, UNDER PRESSURE, AND DOWN THE SIDELINE HE GOES. LAMAR JACKSON. HE IS STOPPED INSIDE THE 1. NAME SOMEBOD CAN DO THAT. KIRK: NOBODY. NOBODY. AS MUCH AS HE AND THIS OFFENSE -- WHEN THE GAME IS ON THE LINE, YOU BETTER GET HIM DOWN. B.J. HILL WITH HIS STUNT MOVE HAS A CHANCE TO KEEP CONTAINED. ONCE HE GOT OUT OF IT, MAYBE SOME OF THE DEFENDERS THOUGHT HE WAS OUT OF BOUNDS, BUT LOOKING AT HIM -- LOOK AT HIM SHAKING PEOPLE. LOOK AT HILL GIVING YOU AN EFFORT, ANDREWS. AL: DO THEY GIVE IT TO HENRY? INDEED THEY DO. AND HE PASSES IT. SO HENRY HAS NOW SCORED A TOUCHDOWN IN EVERY GAME THIS KIRK: THAT IS COMPLEMENTARY FOOTBALL BY THE RAVENS. NOW 14 SECOND HALF, MARLON HUMPHREY THE VETERAN RIPS THE BALL OUT FROM CHASE BROWN, HECK OF A PLAY BY HIM, ROQUAN SMITH, TWO THAT'S MAKE THE PLAY THAT'S ALL LAMAR JACKSON AND DERRICK HENRY NEEDED. AL: SO THEY GET A BIG BREAK, GO 31 YARDS. 4:12 LEFT IN THE THIRD. BENGALS 21, RAVENS 14 ON THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL. NOVEMBER 15. KIRK: THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS. I SEE IT. RETURNABLE, FOUR YARD LINE, BURTON, TO THE OUTSIDE HE GOES. BACKS UP. HE GOES OUT OF BOUNDS TO THE 19. KIRK: THAT LAST SERIES, NOT ONLY THE TURNOVER, AND JOE BURROW, IT TAKES A LOT TO GET HIM KNOCKED OUT, BUT THIS IS A BIG HEAD ON A BLIND SIDE BLITZ TO THE CORNER. MARLON HUMPHREY, YOU FACIAL EXPRESSION, TAKES A BIG HIT. HE'S BACK ON THE FIELD. HE REACHES TO PICK THE HELMET UP. TUGGED DUDE. AL: YEAH. NOBODY KNOWS BETTER THAN HIM. HE HAD A WRIST INJURY LAST YEAR. PLAY-ACTION, HANGS IN THE POCKET, THROWS. BROWN GETS TAKEN DOWN AFTER A GAIN OF SIX. IN THE QUARTER. KIRK: INCREDIBLE WHAT ONE PLAY CAN DO TO A FOOTBALL GAME. DOWN BY 14. BENGALS IN CONTROL WITH THE FOOTBALL, FUMBLED, MARLON HUMPHREY RIPS OUT, SMITH JUMPS ON IT. SPECTACULAR PLAY BY LAMAR AND NOW THEY GET WITHIN THAT POSSESSION. HUGE SECOND AND 3. BOROUGH, STEPPING UP. BUYERS ON THE RUN. CHIEFS MAKE THAT CATCH UP TO THE DUST THEY MAKE THAT CATCH UP TO SIX CATCHES, 134 YARDS. KIRK: THE RAVENS ARE GOING HAVE TO START, THEY AREN'T GETTING A PUSH. THEY BROUGHT THE LINEBACKER SIMPSON HOW MANY TIMES TONIGHT, HOW MANY TIMES ALL YEAR HAVE WE'VE SEEN JOE BURROW WITH TWO HANDS ON THE FOOTBAL THE POCKET. LIKE A SMART CORNERBACK HE'S TRYING TO FIND THEM BECAUSE HE KNOWS THEY CAN COUNT ON HIM WHEN HE GETS ON THE MOVE LIKE THAT. AL: AROUND AGAIN FOR A GAME. SECOND DOWN AND 8. THEY'RE TRYING THEIR BEST PLAYER ON THE DEFENSE HAS A BOOT ON THAT RIGHT FOOT. AL: THE NEXT GAME IS A THEY GO TO PITTSBURGH IN 10 DAYS. KIRK: ONE OF THE MOST MILD-MANNERED, LAID-BACK, DOMINATING, MOST VERSATILE PLAYERS IN AL: SECOND AND 8. HE MAKES THIS GRAB. ABOUT THREE YARDS OUT. HAMILTON, WE HAD HIM OTHER DAY. I'M THINKING TO MYSELF, THIS GUY IS -- CANDIDATE. HE' HE'S A REAL DEAL. KIRK: HIS MOM REALLY PUSHED ACADEMICS AND A BIG PART OF SPORTS. A BIG PART OF HIS CHILDHOOD. PLAYING INSTRUMENTS. HE GOES TO UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME. AS A BRILLIANT CAREER THERE. VERY CEREBRAL AND TALENTED PLAYER. IS IT 6, 7, 8 HANDICAPS. KIND OF FRUSTRATED, HE WANTS TO GET BETTER. AL: THERE'S SOMETHI DO. THIRD AND 2. BOROUGH THROWS CHASE IS THERE. ROQUAN SMITH KNOCKS HIM OUT OF BOUNDS. PLAYING AT BOROUGH, LSU. BOROUGH HAS ENOUGH ROOM FOR 285. FOR NUMBER ONE. KIRK: WATCH ROQUAN SMITH. HE KNOWS THERE'S A CHANCE. HE'S POINTING IT OUT, BUT HE CAN'T STAY WITH HIM. HE'S IN NO MAN'S LAND. STAY WITH JA'MARR CHASE AND BOROUGH IS GOING TO TAKE IT OR RUN OR YOU START TO COME OFF OF THAT'S A TOUGH ASK FOR ROQUE WANTS -- FOR ROQUE WANT TO STAY WITH CHASE. IT'S 151 NOW IN THE NIGHT. AL: SEVEN CATCHES. BOROUGH ON HIS WAY TO 300. INSTEAD, HE GETS SACKED HERE, BACK AT THE 41 YARD LINE. KIRK: THEY PAID HIM BIG MONEY EXPECTING HIM TO DO THESE KIND OF THINGS AND HE'S BEEN CHALLENGED BY ZACH TO BECOME MORE VIOLENT, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE DID THERE. HE'S ABLE TO WIN WITH THAT VIOLENT MENTALITY. HE HAS LOOKED QU IN THE INTERIOR. AL: THAT'S THREE SACKS FOR HIM THAT'S GOING TO TAKE US TO THE FINAL QUARTER. IT WILL BE SECOND IN 16 WHEN THE PLAY RESUMES AFTER THREE. STEELERS LEAD THE DIVISION SIX AND 2. NINE GAMES LEFT AND SIX OF THEM WILL BE AGAINST THE OPPOSITION. 21-14. SECOND AND 16 FOR THE BENGALS AT THE LTIMORE 40 YARD LINE. BOROUGH AGAIN. ROLLS AWAY. DUMPS IT OFF. LEAVING THE TEAM IN SACKS WITH SEVEN. PUT THE PRESSURE ON, THIRD DOWN. KIRK: THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD CHOP DOWNFIELD WITH COVERAGE. BOROUGH GOT RUSHED, BUT IT WAS BECAUSE HIS FIRST AND SECOND OPTION TAKEN AWAY. A LITTLE BIT MORE MAN COVERAGE. PLAYING A LOT OF ZONE, HE MIXED IN A LITTLE MAN THERE GOT SEPARATION. THEY TOOK THE DEFENSE TO GET TO THEM. BOROUGH, AGAIN PRESSURED. FLYERS, INCOMPLETE. NO FLAG. THAT TIME HE HAD LED DARIUS WASHINGTON WHO ALMOST GOT TO BOROUGH FOR THE SACK, F KIRK: HE DECIDES TO WALK. LOOK AT ALL THOSE PURPLE JERSEYS. WHEN YOU'RE IN OFFENSE OF LINE YOU ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT FROM. THAT'S A TOUGH THING TO DO IN FRONT OF THIS CROWD. GAVE HIM ENOUGH ROOM TO AT LEAST STEP UP. SHAKES THAT WOULD BE SACK ANIMALS HITS THAT TO JA'MA CHASE WITH THE PRESSURE JUST ENOUGH THERE FOR THE RAVENS. AL: THIRD PART OF THE NIGHT FOR THE ROOKIE RYAN RICO. THERE CATCH CALLED FOR. MADE AT THE EIGHT YARD LINE BY TOMLIN WALLACE. SECONDS INTO THE FOURTH SEVEN POINT GAME. KIRK: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR NEXT STATS POWERED BY AWS. TRAVELED 58 YARDS. LOOK HOW PRETTY THAT IS. IF YOU WOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT INTO THE END ZONE -- 4%, SOMEHOW OF GAINING THE FIRST DOWN. IF ANYBODY CAN DO IT, IT'S LAMAR WHAT A PLAY. AL: TIGHT ROPING THE SIDELINE ON HIS WAY DOWN THERE. MADE IT PAY OFF AFTER THE TURNOVER. AND NOW DOW GO. START WITH THE PASS. SURE CAME HERE. GERMAINE PRATT IN ON THE TACKLE. KIRK: RAVENS ARE GOING TO COME YOU WILL SEE BATEMAN OR FLOWERS. SOMEBODY'S GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A PLAY ON THE OUTSIDE FOR THIS GREAT FRIENDS -- RAVENS OFFENSE. MARK ANDREWS IS A SOLID PLAYER BUT YOU NEEDED ASTONISHING PLAY TO HELP LAMAR JACKSON. LET'S KEEP EVERYTHING IN FRONT. GET THOSE SAFETIES BACK. AL: THEY'VE DONE A GREAT JOB ON HIM TONIGHT. TAYLOR COMES UP TO STOP HIM. KIRK: THEY SLANT THEIR DEFENSE OF FRONT TO THE ANTICIPATING. THIS DEFENSE IS COMING THIS WAY. ALMOST ANTICIPATING THAT THEY WILL GO TO THAT SUITE. GREAT JOB BY THE CORNER. AL: WALLACE MAKES THE GRAB. WALLACE DOWN THE SIDELINE. WALLACE IS GOING TO GO ALL THE HE STAYED IN BOUNDS ALL THE WAY. SO ON A THIRD AND 2, TOMLIN WALLACE WITH A MOMENT WITH THE KIRK: WHICH ONE OF THESE WIDE RECEIVERS IS GOING TO MAKE A WE BROUGHT UP FLOWERS. INSTEAD IT'S WALLACE WHO ENDS UP GETTING AWAY FROM THIS DEFENSE. HE HAS A TACKLE. WILSON WITH THE STIFF-ARM. SAFETY, HE COMES OVER LATE. WHAT AN EFFORT BY TOMLIN WALLACE TO TAKE THAT ALL OVER THE END HERE'S A GREAT LOOK TO SEE IF HE STAYED IN BOUNDS. RIGHT HERE WHEN WILSON HITS BECAUSE VERY CLOSE. KIRK: THAT'S THE ONE THE LOOK AT. EVERY OTHER STEP HE TOOK IS CLEARLY IN BOUNDS. IT WAS THAT WAS CLOSE. AL: ALMOST LOOKED LIKE THE TOE WAS IN AND THE HEEL WAS U THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT IF IT STANDS, IT'S 84 YARDS. LOOK AT THIS. KIRK: YOU'RE RIGHT, THE TOE DOWN, THEY HEEL NEVER TOUCHES. YOU LOOK AT THAT AND YOU THINK THAT FOOT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ON THE WHITE LINE BUT THE HEEL IS HE'S GOOD. AL: TURNER WAS ALL GOOD IN TOUCH FOR THE POINT AFTER. OF ALL THE GUYS, JUSTIN TUCKER. WOW. BILL FIGURE THAT BABY OUT. 21-20, CINCINNATI. WELL, JUSTIN TUCKER ONLY MISSES HIS SEVEN EXTRA POINTS OUT OF BUT THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN THE GAME RIGHT NOW AS HE KICKS OFF. 21-20, BENGALS HANGING ON BY A THREAD. THEY WILL START THIS DRIVE FROM THE 30 YARD LINE, BACK WE GO. KIRK: THE DEFENSE PLAYED WELL TONIGHT, I JUST WONDER WHERE WAS THE DEFENSE ON THIS PLAY. WATCH THE EFFORT HERE AS IT SLOWS DOWN BY LOGAN GENO STONE. THEY THINK THE PLAY IS MADE, THEY KIND OF GIVE UP ON IT AND THEN THEY TAKE OFF. THAT SLIGHT HESITATION IS A STEP OR TWO PREVENTING THEM FROM AT THE VERY LEAST, PUSHING ALL OF THIS OUT OF BOUNDS. SO I THINK THEY THOUGHT THE PLAY WAS MADE, THEY STOPPED, AND THEN THEY TRIED TO TURN UP THE SPEED. BY THEN, IT WAS TOO LATE. AL: 84 YARDS, LONGEST PASSIVE JACKSON'S CAREER. BOROUGH -- BURROW. KAYLEE: WE WERE KEEPING AN EYE ON JOE BOROUGH AFTER HE TOOK THAT SHOT TO HIS LEFT LOWER RIBS. JUST AS YOU SAW HIM GRIMACE WHEN HE REACHED FOR HIS LEFT ARM BEFORE THEIR PREVIOUS DRIVE. WE SAW SOMET THIS TIME WHEN HE REACHED FOR THE HELMET WITH HIS LEFT ARM HE WAS REMINDING HIMSELF THAT IT ACTUALLY HURT AND GRIMACED. HE THEN HAD TO REVERT TO PICKING UP THE HELMET WITH HIS RIGHT ARM TO PUT IT ON BUT HE DID RECEIVE ANY MEDICAL ATTENTION WHILE ON THE SIDELINE. AL: COMPLETES OUT ONE FOR 17 TO BROWN. WE WERE TALKING TO HAMILTON THE OTHER DAY ABOUT A TEAM PLAYER. WHAT'S THE BEST PLAY OF YOUR CAREER. HE SAID IT WAS RETURNED AND OVER TIME TO BEAT THEM LAST YEAR. KIRK: USUALLY IT'S LIKE IT MIGHT'VE BEEN THIS INTERCEPTION. AND HE SAID IT'S NOT EVEN IN HOW: BEAT THE RAMS IN OT HERE. IT IS CRUNCH TIME HERE UNDER 12:30 TO GO. BURROW NOW HAS THROWN FOR 304 25 OF 40. GOOD PROTECTION FOR HIM, GOOD COVERAGE BY THE RAVENS AS THE ROOKIE MAKES THAT GRAB AT THIRD DOWN AND SIX. KIRK: KEEP MIXING UP THESE PERSONNEL GROUPINGS WITH ZAC TAYLOR. THOSE TWO TIGHT ENDS, THREE TITANS, ROTATING IN AND OUT. HAVE TO TRY TO CREATE A MATCHUP. TOUGH MATCHUP FOR JA'MARR CHASE. OFFENSIVE LINE IS GOING TO GIVE HIM TIME TO THROW IN TIME TO STEP UP THE WAY HE HAS MOST OF AL: THE CROWD ROARING, STANDING. CHASE WIDE RIGHT. AND THIRD AND SIX. BURROW OVER THE MIDDLE, CAUGHT. BROWN, DIVES. FIRST DOWN TO THE 41 YARD LINE. 13 CARRIES, HE HAS NOW FOR 46 YARDS ON TOP OF THAT. KIRK: HE DOES A GOOD JOB. I THOUGHT IT WOULD LOOK AT HIS EYES. HE HAS ALREADY LOOKE INSTEAD HE TOOK THAT AWAY. WHAT A GOOD JOB HOLDI MAKING BETTER OF IT, THEN JUST CHECKING IT -- CHECKING IT DOWN. THOSE LINEBACKERS, PUMP FAKE AND CREATED THAT OPENING. AL: EXTRA PRESSURE GETS IT AWAY. CAUGHT ALONG THE SIDELINES. MAKING THAT GRAB. PICKS UP THREE. WASHINGTON ON THE TACKLE. KIRK: TONIGHT, THIS PACKAGE THAT THEY BUILT WITH GESICKI AND JA'MARR CHASE ON THAT SAME SIDE, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY GET MAN-TO-MAN WHEN THEY GET SO CONSUMED AND WORRIED ABOUT CHASE MAKING PLAYS. THEY ARE OFTEN C GESICKI. EASY THROW THEIR FOR BURROW. JUST FOR POSITIVE YARDS. AL: SECOND AND FIVE. -- 5. ALL NIGHT LONG TO BROWN. KIRK: THAT'S THEIR RUNNING GAME. DOESN'T SHOW UP IN THE STAT SHEET. THAT HAS BEEN THEIR RUNNING GAME ALL YEAR. ESPECIALLY BEEN THE CASE LET THE LINEBACKERS CLEAR OUT, THEN CHECK IT DOWN. YOU KEEP CHECKING IT DOWN, YOU KEEP DOING THAT, THOSE EYES START TO CREEP UP, THE PACKERS START TO CREEP UP AND THAT'S WHAT JA'MARR CHASE CONTINUES TO DO BEHIND THEM. TALKED ABOUT IT EARLIER. REALLY GOOD PLAN TONIGHT WITH ALL THAT SPACE WITH THE AL: THIRD AND 2. BROWN BACK INTO THE BACKFIELD. PLAY CLOCK UNDER FIVE. GOING FOR IT ALL. CHASE, DOUBLE COVERED, MARCUS WILLIAMS BACK THERE. FOURTH DOWN AND 2. KIRK: WHEN YOU THROW A BALL LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW THEY ARE GOING FOR IT ON FOURTH DOWN. IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT TAKING A SHOT TO JA'MARR CHASE. I LOVE THE SWEEP THAT MARLON HUMPHREY SAID TO THE MEDIA. I THINK JOE BURROW LOVES THROWING THE BALL FORWARD TO H GUYS. BECAUSE A LOT OF TIME HE BELIEVES IN HIS GUYS IN THE HOUR THAT HE CAN THROW. THAT TIME HE JUST THREW IT OUT THERE KNOWING IF YOU MISSED IT HE WOULD GIVE IT A SHOT HERE ON THE 52. AL: IT WOULD BE ABOUT A 53 FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT. FOURTH AND 2 WITH THE PLAY CLOCK AT ONE. AGAIN GOING DEEP. THAT'S INCOMPLETE. TRYING TO GO TO BURDEN THAT AND THE RAVENS NOW TAKE OVER. AT THEIR OWN 34 YARD LINE. 9:24 LEFT IN BALTIMORE ON THURSDAY NIGHT. THE RELIABILITY REPORT PRESENTED BY XFINITY INTERNET. THREE PLAYS BY THIS RAVENS LAMAR JACKSON IN POSITION. RAVENS ARE ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON IT. HE STAYS IN BOUNDS. TWO DEFENDERS COME OVER A LITTLE BIT LATE. THEY ARE ONE POINT AWAY FROM MAYBE IF THERE'S ANYTHING THEY CAN DO AND MAYBE THEY CAN TAKE THE LEAD. AL: TAKING OVER ON BOUNDS. BOTH THE 35 YARD LINES. WIDE OPEN. INSIDE THE TERRITORY. THEY GO AGAIN. OKLAHOMA STATE. COVERS THAT TIME LINE. THAT'S A GAIN OF 20. KIRK: THEY MOTION OUT AND I THINK HE JUST ENDS UP GETTING LOST IN COVERAGE. ONCE THEY MOTION HIM OUT THERE, THEY'VE GOT HIM OUTFLANKED. THEY'VE GOT ONE TOO MANY RECEIVERS. UPTIGHT ON THE UNDERNEATH ROUTE. NOBODY IS THERE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE WALLACE. WALLACE AT 16 COMING ALIVE. AL: 84 YARD GAIN, 20 YARD GAIN. FIRED UP A LITTLE. THAT'S ANDREWS. HE GETS INTO THE ACTION. ALREADY IN FIELD GOAL RANGE, KIRK: SINCE MARLON HUMPHREY GOT THE BALL OUT OF CHASE BROWN, RAVENS ARE PLAYING THEIR STYLE OF FOOTBALL. THERE PLAYING ON THEIR TERMS, DEFENSIVELY, MORE AGGRESSIVE, OFFENSIVELY, GETTING FIRST DOWN POSITIVE YARDS. NOT GOING BACK FOR DOING LEGAL PROCEDURE. THERE DOING THEIR T AL: HENRY. GAIN OF NINE. OLDS MOMENTUM NOW. THE RAVENS ARE TACKLED ERASING A 14 POINT DEFICIT AND NOW ON A QUEST FOR RE-TAKING THE LEAD. KIRK: IN TIMES WE SEE THIS WHEN DERRICK HENRY WAS IN HIS PRIME. BLACKS -- BACKSIDE BLOCKS. GOOD SIDE WITH DRESSING THAT HENRY HAS DIVISION, NICE CUT THEREBY HENRY. AL: SECOND AND 1, JACKSON, AND HE PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN. A LITTLE HAND SLAPPED FOR THE FAN. ANDREWS LED THE WAY. GAIN A FIVE FIRST DOWNS. KIRK: IT'S LIKE TODD IS HOLDING ONTO THAT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER JUST FOR THE RIGHT TIME TO BE ABLE TO TURN HIM LOOSE THAT TIME HE HAD AN ESCORT BLOCKER OUT IN FRONT OF HIM, MARK ANDREWS AND TODD MONCKTON FEELING IT. QUARTERBACKS PLAYING WELL. AL: DUMPS IT OFF. SAM COVERED AT 94. ON THAT TACKLE, THREE SECOND KIRK: AT THIS OFFENSE, DROPPING BOTH OF THEIR DEFENSE OF ENDS. DROPPING OUT IN THE FLAT. HAD A IN COVERAGE, ONLY RUSHING TRYING TO GET HIM TO JUST HOLD ONTO THE FOOT -- TO THE NOT ALWAYS IN PRESSURE AND IN THE BLITZ. AL: THIS TIME IT'S HILL. STOPPED AT THE 19 YARD LINE. HENDRICKSON AND ON THAT TACKLE ALONG WITH MIKE HILTON. A BIG THIRD AND NINE. KIRK: HENDRICKSON IS TALENTED. FOR THE HIS SIZE, NOT ONLY A PASS RUSHER, YOU COULD SEE ON THAT PLAY THE SPEED THAT HE HAS TO BE ABLE TO CHASE DOWN THE BALL CARRIER, HILL. AL: HENDRICKSON, STARTING HIS CAREER IN NEW ORLEANS. EIGHTH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE. LEADING THE LEAGUE IN SACKS. THIRD AND 9. TOUCHDOWN! MARK ANDREWS. BLITZ AND GOT BURNED. 18 YARDS, 0-2. KIRK: IT LOOKED LIKE A MIXUP IN LOGAN WILSON HAS TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THIS CROSSING ROUTE. HE WAS WORKING ACROSS, THAT KIM TAYLOR. THEY ALMOST RAN INTO EACH OTHER. BUT CLEARLY LOOKED CONFUSED. NOBODY TAKES THE BIG GUY. ANOTHER PERFECT THROW BY LAMAR AL: ANDREWS TO THE END ZONE, JACKSON IS NOW THROWN FOR 234. GOING FOR TWO TO TRY TO MAKE IT A SEVEN POINT LEAD. ATTENTION. AL: JACKSON. STRUTS IN. FLINGS IT AWAY. IT'S GOOD. THE ROAD -- THEY'VE ERASED A 14 POINT DEFICIT TO LEAD BY SEVEN. 28-21. RAY LEWIS IS RIGHT HERE AFTER THAT BEAUTIFUL SHOT. KIRK: RAY IS READY TO PLAY. HE'S FIRING UP THE CROWD. HE STILL FIRED UP. AL: GOING BACK TO THOSE YEARS. IT'S RETURNABLE, BUT THEY WILL BE DOWN INTO THE END ZONE. KIRK: THINK ABOUT CINCINNATI GOING BACK TO WEEK FIVE. HERE'S THE QUARTERBACK TONIGHT. BOTH THESE GUYS AND THEY DID PLAY IN WEEK FIVE THEY PUT UP BIG NUMBERS. WHAT A TURNAROUND FOR LAMAR JACKSON 2026, THREE TOUCHDOWNS, 234. REMEMBER CINCINNATI HAD A LEAD IN THAT GAME. THERE WERE UP 10 IN QUARTER. TONIGHT THEY WERE UP PLAY 14 IN THE THIRD QUARTER. KIRK: THE RAVENS -- AL: THE RAVENS HAVE CLOCKED UP SO MANY FOURTH QUARTER LEAGUES -- LEADS IN THE YEAR. BRO GOING DEEP. CHASE, LOOK AT THIS! JUST LIKE THAT. CHASE IS GOING TO STRUT TO THE ONE YARD LINE, CROWD DOESN'T LIKE THAT. KIRK: THAT'S A RESPONSE TO WHAT LAMAR JACKSON DID. YOU TALK ABOUT AN ANSWER. YOU TALK ABOUT NUMBER NINE RESPONDING AND JA'MARR CHASE MAKING A HUGE PLAY. AL: 70 YARDS. CHASE TONIGHT, 238 RECEIVING YARDS AND BOROUGHS 400. HE'S 389 AT THE MOMENT. WELL -- WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG? THAT TOOK 13 SECONDS OF WHICH HE WASTED L5 BEFORE HE GOT INTO THE MCPHERSON TO TIE THE GAME. SO AT 28-28, LAST TIME THEY HAVE 3140 EIGHT. HIGH-SCORING GAME OF THE SEASON WITH 5:37 LEFT IN THIS ONE. WILLIAMS. WE GIVE BENGALS ALL THE CREDIT. HE GETS CAUGHT UP, AND THEN HE JUST GETS LOST. I DON'T KNOW THE COVERAGE, S DON'T KNOW IF HE NEEDS TO BE BACK THERE IN CENTER FIELD, BUT OBVIOUSLY SOMEBODY NEEDS TO BE HELD AT 21 STEVENS OUT. THAT'S A MISMATCH. HE NEED SOMEBODY BACK THERE TO BE ABLE TO HELP HIM OVER TOP. LOOK AT STEVENS RUNNING. I THINK THEY GAVE UP ON THE PLAY LOOKING AROUND AT EACH OTHER LIKE, WHERE WAS MY HELP OVER TOP. THAT TIME MARCUS WILLIAMS WAS BENCHED JUST A COUPLE OF AGO. HE RESPONDED WELL LAST WEEK. BUT A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION, AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND A TIGHT GAME AGAINST JOE BURROW. HE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT EVERY SINGLE TIME. WHAT A THROW IN THERE IS THAT CHEMISTRY AGAIN WITH BURRO AND AL: THE RAVENS WITH THE DEAD LAST FAST OFFENSE IN THE NFL. KIRK: THIS GUY, DOES HE GET ENOUGH HYPE FOR HOW GOOD HE IS? WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE ELITE, ELITE RECEIVERS. AL: HE'S AMONG THEM. KIRK: HE SURE IS. AL: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE RAVENS AND HOW MUCH TROUBLE THEY'VE HAD IN RECENT SEASONS AND THE FRUIT -- FOURTH QUARTER HOLDING ONTO LEADS. FIVE LOSSES AND LEADING IN THE FOURTH, TIED FOR THE SECOND MOST SINCE 2023. SO, AGAIN YOU ARE IN THE SITUATION, A BIG COMEBACK, AND THEN GIVING UP ON ONE PLAY THAT AMOUNTS TO THE TYING TOUCHDOWN. KIRK: WE'VE GOT TWO OF THE BEST CORNER BACKS IN THE LEAD GOING HEAD UP 28 WITH 5:30 LEFT TO GO. AL: JACKSON, LOOK OUT. AVOID THE SACK. HE THROWS DEEP. THAT IS PICKED OFF BY TAYLOR BRICKS. CAN TAYLOR BRITT -- OF COURSE THE BENGALS NOW PENDING ANOTHER TURNOVERS ARE REVIEWED, DOES HE HOLD ON, DOES HE KEEP IT? PREMATURE CELEBRATION. HE WAS IN THE END ZONE. KIRK: DEFINITELY COME BACK. JUST NOT ABLE TO GET HIS ARMS UNDERNEATH THE FOOTBALL BEFORE IT HITS THE SURFACE. A COUPLE OF GREAT LOOKS. IN LAMAR JACKSON LIVES TO TELL ABOUT IT. GOT AWAY WITH ONE THERE. AGAIN, HE COULD'VE TAKEN OFF, HAD POSITIVE YARDS IF YOU WANTED TO RUN IT. AL: SO SECOND AND 10. PLEASE PUT FIVE MINUTES AND 27 SECONDS ON THE CLOCK RAVENS HAVE THREE TOUCHDOWNS ON THE LAST THREE DRIVES. ABOUT A FOUR YARD GAME. THIRD AND 6 AS THE CLOCK TICKS DOWN TO FIVE MINUTES AGO AND THE FOURTH. KIRK: HE RUNS THE FOOTBALL WITH DERRICK HENRY. HE'S DONE A LOT OF SHIFTING, A LOT OF CHANGING TO RESPOND TO AT THE RAVENS ARE GOING TO. AL: THIRD AND 6. FOUR-MAN RUSH. LAMAR THROWS, CAUGHT, FIRST TO THE 48 YARD LINE. BEEN A LOT OF KEY CATCHES TONIGHT FOR A TOTAL FIRST DOWN. KIRK: WILSON IS UP AND THEN DROPS. ONCE HE DROPS THERE'S A VOID IN RECEIVER COMES FROM THE LEFT AND SITS RIGHT THERE. LAMAR JACKSON WAITS UNTIL THE VERY LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT BEFORE HE DOES THAT, HE DOES THAT A LOT AND KIND OF JUMP PASS WHERE HE ELEVATES AND FLICKS THE BALL TO THE OPEN RECEIVER. BALTIMORE PROBABLY NOT IN A BIG HURRY RIGHT NOW. AL: FOUR MINUTES TO GO. JACKSON TO THE OUTSIDE. THAT'S TAKEN BY FLOWERS. FLOWERS IS FINALLY WRESTLED DOWN AT ABOUT THE 35 YARD LINE, FIRST KIRK: RIGHT THERE LAMAR JACKSON IS LOOKING DOWN FIELD, KNOWING HE COULD SENSE THE DEFENSE HAD DROPPED. NOBODY WAS OUT THERE. SO HE WAITED AND WAITED. DOWNFIELD, DOWNFIELD, KNOWING HE WOULD TAKE THE SEASON PERIPHERAL VISION. AL: A GAIN OF 19. TURNS ABOUT IT THREE YARD GAIN INTO AN EIGHT YARD TACKLED BY HILL, SECOND IN A DEUCE. KIRK: WORK THROUGH THAT ARM TACKLE OF DAVIS GAITHER THERE. WHEN HE RUNS THE FOOTBALL AT THIS STAGE IN THE GAME USUALLY GETS STRONGER AS THE GAME GOES ON HE GETS TOUGHER AND TOUGHER TO TACKLE AND SHOOK OFF A COUPLE WOULD BE TACKLERS. NUMBER ONE SAYING JUST GIVE US ANOTHER CHANCE. AL: SECOND AND2. HENRY AGAIN, JUST ENOUGH. THAT'S ALL HE NEEDED. TAKES MORE TIME OFF THE CLOCK. HE HAS FULL COMPLEMENTS PLUS TIMEOUT AND THE TWO-MINUTE UNDER THREE TO PLAY. KIRK: 41-30 AND OVER TIME. WEEK FIVE. HERE WE ARE 28-28 UNDER THREE TO AL: AFC NORTH, PITTSBURGH, BALTIMORE IS ALMOS ATMOSPHERE. KIRK: IN THE OLD DAYS IT WAS MORE ABOUT DEFENSE. THEY ARE MORE PHYSICAL TEAM. NOW THE QUARTERBACK PLAYING, ESPECIALLY THESE TWO TEAMS. AL: NOW WITH THE PLAY CLOCK AT TWO. RAVENS HAVE TO TAKE A TIMEOUT. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS GAME, IF THE RAVENS WIN, THEY ARE THREE GAMES UP ON THESE GUYS. EVERYBODY IS FORGETTIN PITTSBURGH. PITTSBURGH STILL HAS TO PLAY ALL SIX DIVISION GAMES. BUT THE AFC NORTH, THEY WILL BE GREAT AND THEY ARE AGAIN. KIRK: YOU KNEW COMING IN, BALTIMORE LOSES THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME A YEAR AGO AT HOME AGAINST KANSAS CITY. BEING AROUND THIS WEEK, I THINK BEING THAT CLOSE AND LOSING, ESPECIALLY LAMAR. LAMAR TALKING ABOUT WITH KAYLEE BEFORE WE STARTED, HE'S POSSESSED, HE'S FOCUSED. I THINK IT'S BECAUSE HE'S ACCOMPLISHED EVERYTHING. HE HAS ONE AND VPS, HE MAY WIN ANOTHER THIS YEAR BUT HE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT RING IN THIS TEAM IS DRIVEN TO GET THAT OPPORTUNITY. AL: PITTSBURGH ON THE CHARGERS. FLOWERS MAKES THE GRAB. THERE'S A FLAG ON THE PLAY. KIRK: SO HE TAKES A PEEK, RUN PASS OPTION WHERE HE CAN RUN IT OFF TO HENRY. THIS IS WHERE HE WILL GET HE DECIDES TO THROW IT. HE CAN HAND THIS BALL TO HENRY. HE SEES WHAT HE WANTS BECAUSE HE HAD LEVERAGE. ONCE THIS DEFENDER GOT INSIDE HE KNEW HE COULD THROW IT TO THE THE PROBLEM IS, IT TOOK TOO LONG IT'S ALWAYS FRUSTRATING TO A COACH WHEN YOU HAVE A RUN/PASS OPTION AND YOU FIND THEM IN DOWNFIELD ON THE RIGHT CALL IS MADE. AL: SO FIRST AND 15. BALL BACK AT THE 29. KIRK: A LITTLE DUMP OFFS -- AL: A LITTLE DUMP OFF. ANDREWS. DAVIS GAITHER MAKES THE STOP. THINKING ABOUT TAKING TIME OUT SO THEY DO RIGHT HERE. IN THE OLD DAYS, LIKE 20 MINUTES AGO, YOU WOULD SAY, AUTOMATIC FOR JUSTIN TUCKER, ONE OF THE GREATS OF ALL TIME. I DON'T THINK ANYTHING IS AUTOMATIC THESE DAYS WITH A LOT OF KICKERS. THAT'S THE EXTRA POINT BEFORE. KIRK: I THINK YOU GOT CONFIDENCE IN LAMAR JACKSON, HIS DECISION-MAKING AND PLAYMAKING ABILITY AND THE PLAYERS AROUND I THINK KNOWING JOHN HARBAUGH, HE WILL BE AGGRESSIVE. THEY WILL TRY TO GET A TOUCHDOWN AND AT THE SAME TIME WORK THAT CLOCK DOWN BECAUSE OF BURRO AND SECOND AND 10. BOUGHT, SPINNING AROUND. TAKES IT TO THE EIGHT YARD LINE. THAT BALL WAS HFWAY IN THE AIR BEFORE BATEMAN GOT TO THE TOP OF HIS ROW. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS HERE IS YOUR RECEIVER, WHEN HE THROWS THIS FOOTBALL. SOFT COVERAGE. GOING TO STOP IT RIGHT AS HE RELEASES THE BALL AND LOOK WHERE BATEMAN IS. BALL HAS ALREADY BEEN WELL OUT, IT'S HALFWAY THROUGH AND HE STARTING TO TURN HIS HEAD. THAT'S TOUGH TO COVER ONE A RECEIVER AND QUARTERBACK ARE THROWING IT IN SYNC AND HE LOCATES IT TO THAT OUTSIDE SHOULDER AWAY FROM THE CORNER. AL: BATEMAN IS ONE OF THOSE UNSUNG GUYS. FLOWERS HAS BEEN GETTING A LOT OF FLOWERS. WALLACE HAS BEEN THE GUIDED NIGHT BUT BATEMAN HAS MADE SOME VERY KEY CATCHES TONIGHT. THEY WILL BE CONTENT TO TAKE IT TO THE FIVE YARD LINE. TAKES US TO THE TWO-MINUTE BANGLES HAVE ONE TIMEOUT LEFT. IT WILL BE SECOND IN GOAL WHEN TWO MINUTES LEFT IN REGULATION AND A TIE GAME. TWO MINUTES TO GO, WE A TIED. IT IS SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. KIRK: I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED CINCINNATI LETS THEM SCORE JUST TO GIVE BURROW TIME COMPARED TO LETTING AL: THIS IS HIM IN THE END ZONE. THAT THE BIG BREAK FOR THE BENGALS BECAUSE THAT STOPS THE CLOCK. NOW IT'S THIRD DOWN AND GOAL IN THE BANGLES HOLD ON TO THAT ONE KIRK: IF YOU THINK ABOUT BALTIMORE RUNNING THE FOOTBALL ONES, RUNNING AT A SECOND TIME. TIMEOUTS. YOU WORK IT ALL THE WAY DOWN 30, 35 SECONDS. CHIP SHOT TO TAKE THE LEAD WITH 30-35 SECONDS. COMPARED TO GIVING BURROW A LITTLE BIT OF TIME, YOU HAVE TO GO SCORE A TOUCHDOWN, BUT AT LEAST YOU HAVE SOME TIME TO WORK. NOW THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT AFTER THE INCOMPLETE. AL: NOT THIRD AND GOAL. RUNNING AROUND. JUMP PASS, TOUCHDOWN. BATEMAN. RASHOD BATEMAN, AND THEY HAVE THE LEAD AGAIN. KIRK: THAT WAS QUITE THE JUMP SHOT. HE HAS SHOWN INABILITY TONIGHT TO WORK FROM THE POCKET, HE HAS SHOWN THE ABILITY TO GET HE HAS SHOWN A LOT OF VELOCITY WHEN HE HAD TO PUT SOMETHING ON IT, HE HAS ALSO SHOWN A LOT OF THESE TOUCH PASSES THAT HE HAS THROWN TO THESE RECEIVERS THAT TIME WHEN YOU SEE THIS FOLLOW-THROUGH IS LIKE A STEPH CURRY JUMP SHOT A TOUCHDOWN. AL: THAT'S FOR TOUCHDOWN PASSES FOR JACKSON TONIGHT. THE RAVENS HAVE SCORE TOUCHDOWNS ON FOUR STRAIGHT DRIVES AND THE EXTRA POINT IS GOOD. KIRK: IT WORKS OUT, THEY HAVE TIME TO WORK HERE'S THIS THROW. NOW WATCH THIS STEPH CURRY LITTLE JUMP, AND LOOK AT THE FOLLOW-THROUGH. PERFECT LOCATION. YOUR GUY, BATEMAN WITH THE GO-AHEAD TOUCHDOWN. AL: SIX FOR BATEMAN TONIGHT. FOR TOUCHDOWN PASSES FOR LAMAR. HE'S GOING FOR 290 NOW. THERE'S BATEMAN WORKING ON DELIBERATE. KIRK: PUT THAT FOOT IN THE GROUND GOING THE OTHER WAY. HE'S GOT IT. AS SOON AS HE THREW IT HE STARTS TO HEAD TO THE BENCH. 70 FRONT -- 71 YARDS IN THE FIRST HALF AT 219 AND THREE TOUCHDOWNS IN THE SECOND HALF. AL: I THINK THEY MADE A FEW ADJUSTMENTS. KIRK: I THINK THEY DID. IT WILL BE FUN TO SEE WHAT JOE BURROW CHASE CAN DO. AL: YOU NEVER KNOW. IT AIN'T OVER, BABY. SEVEN POINT LEAD. DOWN IN THE END ZONE. START AT THE 30. REMINDER AFTER THE GAME IS THE POST GAME SHOW ON PRIME VIDEO. THEY WILL BE INTERVIEWING THE START OF THE GAME, OUR GANG IS HERE TO RECAP AT ALL. QUITE THE RECAP -- A RECAP TONIGHT. A LOT. KIRK: THIS COMES DOWN TO THE OFFENSIVE LINE GIVING JOE BURROW TIME TO THROW. JOE BURROW LIVES FOR THESE OF OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE PRESSURE ON. NO TIMEOUTS, DOWN SEVEN. AL: CHASE DOWN, THROWS, CAN'T BE ONE-HANDED BECAUSE ALWAYS PUTS THE PRESSURE ON, SECOND AND 10 WITH 1:44. KIRK: INTERESTING DECISION WITH THE FIRST TIME DEFENSE COORDINATOR LEARNING AS HE GOES, DOING A GOOD JOB, HE WAS UPSTAIRS, CAME OVER A FEW WEEKS PRESSURE THERE. SITTING BACK IN PREVENT DEFENSE. GET AFTER BURROW. AL: CHASE TO THE RIGHT. BURROW, PRESSURE, HE THROWS. HE'S HAD THREE SACKS TONIGHT. KIRK: IT LOOKED LIKE THEY MAY HAVE GOTTEN A HOLD OF JOE BURROW'S FACEMASK THERE ON THE LET'S SEE IF IT DID. YEAH, HE GOT HIS THUMB. HE ACTUALLY GRABBED ONTO IT. NO CALLS, SO IT'S THIRD AND 10. AL: HE SURE DID. NO CALL. PROTECTION. THEY' AL: BURROW FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE, NOBODY HOME THERE. SO, FOURTH DOWN. DOWN TO ONE MORE PLAY. KIRK: BRINGS THE PRESSURE. BURROW HAD TO GET THE BALL OUT, MISCOMMUNICATION. THEY ARE NOT MAKING THAT MOVE OVER THE MIDDLE WHERE THEY'VE HAD SO MUCH SUCCESS TONIGHT. FIRST PLAY THE GAME. AL: LAST GAS. FOURTH DOWN, BURROW FIRES, AND THAT IS GOING TO BE CAUGHT AT THE 40 YARD LINE. AND THEY ARE GOING TO GIVE HIM THE FIRST. WITH THE FIRST DOWN. AND THEY STOP THE CLOCK YOU CAN'T CHALLENGE ANYTHING AT THIS BUT YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE DOING. SO THEY WILL LOOK AT THIS UPSTAIRS. WHOA, WHERE'S THE BALL? KIRK: WHERE IS THE BALL AND THAT NEED TOUCHES. AL: IT CAN'T BE WHAT ARE YOU SEEING? >> YOU LOOK FOR A DOWN THE LINE TOUCHES. IF IT TOUCHES THE 40, IT'S A WE HAVEN' WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING YET SO FAR UNTIL IT'S CLEAR AND OBVIOUS THAT WE REVERSE THIS. AS OF NOW IT'S GOING TO STAND. KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE HE' KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S ON THE LINE WITH THE BALL COMES DOWN. WHAT IN EFFORT WITH THE GAME ON AL: THAT'S THE END OF THE PLAY, BUT THE POINT OF THE BALL IS ON THE 40 YARD LINE, IT'S A FIRST IF IT'S A FIRST DOWN YOU HAVE 121 AND YOU STILL HAVE THAT IN THE BALL WILL BE AT THE 40 MEANWHILE, LET'S NOTICE YOU LOOK AT JACKSON, FOR TOUCHDOWN PASSES RIGHT NOW, LAMAR JACKSON HAS THROWN 24 TOUCHDOWN PASSES IN TWO INTERCEPTIONS. 24-2. KIRK: NOT TO MENTION WHAT HE DOES WITH HIS LEGS OVER 500 YARDS RUSHING. AGAIN, BURROW ONCE AGAIN GETS HIT AS HE MAKES THAT THROW. AL: IN THE BANGLES HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO HUDDLE WHICH LEADS US TO BELIEVE THEY'VE ALREADY TOLD CINCINNATI IT'S GOING TO STAND. EVEN THOUGH BLAKEMAN IS LOOKING AT IT. HARBAUGH WANTS TO LEAVE IT OFF BUT TO NO AVAIL -- BUT TO NO AVAIL, WE THINK IT'S GOING TO STAND. OUR INSIDE INFORMATION. WHATEVER THAT IS. SO HERE WE GO. 81 SECONDS, ONE TIMEOUT. KIRK: THEY KEEP MOVING JA'MARR HE'S BEEN ON THE LEFT, THE AL: BURROW HAS NOW THROWN FOR 399 YARDS. BURROW FIRES, INCOMPLETE. SMOTHERED. KIRK: THESE DEFENSIVE BACKS OF HAD TO MOVE AROUND A DERRIUS WASHINGTON. HE'S 5'8". YOU'D THINK HE WAS SIX FOOT 5, 66. -- 6'6". HE'S ABLE TO EXTEND IT AND KNOCK THE BALL AWAY. AL: TO THE OUTSIDE, CHASE, A FLAG IS THROWN ON THE PLAY. KIRK: HE GRABBED A HOLD OF THE RECEIVER. AL: IF IT'S ON THE DEFENSE IT'S AN AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. AND YOU WOULD TAKE THE PENALTY. YOU GOT A HANDFUL OF SECONDS. KIRK: DID HE GET A HOLD OF THE SHOULDER PATTER THE FACE MASKS? HE DID. THAT'LL BE TACKED ON TO THE BACKEND THAT'S 15 MORE YARDS. AL: THEY MISSED ONE FACEMASK BUT GOT THE OTHER. KIRK: IT'S THE VETERAN, HUMPHREY, GETS THAT RIGHT HAND JUST TRYING TO GET OFF THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. AL: THE BALL NOW AT THE 45. 66 SECONDS. THROWS, HE'S GOT CHASE AGAIN. ADD CHASE TO THE 23 BUT A FLAG IS THROWN ON THIS PLAY WITH TWO FLAGS KIRK: BURROW GOT DESTROYED AFTER HE THROUGH THIS CALL. AL: ON BRODERICK WASHINGTON. KIRK: BY THE WAY, HE HAS BEEN HIT ALL NIGHT. GETS HIT OVER TODD, THEY FOLLOW THROUGH AND DRIVE HIM INTO THE GROUND, WASHINGTON DOES. LOOK WHERE THEIR LOCATION OF THE BALL IS. ONCE AGAIN UNDER DURESS. HE GETS A TO HIS GUY, HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL LINE AND IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE THEY ARE INSIDE OF THE RED ZONE. AL: 15 YARD PENALTY. A LOT GOING ON. IF HE SCORES, HE IS 0-2. THE RAVENS HAVE PLENTY OF TIME. THEY'VE GOT TO TIMEOUTS. 59 SECONDS. FROM THE 12. BURROW TO THE BACK CORNER OF THE END ZONE, IN INCOMPLETE THERE COVERED BY NATE WIGGINS, SECOND KIRK: JUST AMAZED HOW JOE BURROW SITS IN THAT POCKET, HE DOESN'T HAS HAPPY FEET. HE GETS HIT ALMOST EVERY TIME HE EVERY WEEK OF THE SEASON. NOT TONIGHT, EVERY WEEK. THIS IS YEAR FIVE AND THE GUY DOESN'T FLINCH. IT'S REMARKABLE. AL: THOSE PIERCING EYES SURVEYING THAT DEFENSE SECOND AND 10. HANGS IN THE POCKET AGAIN, FIRES, CAUGHT THE FIVE CHASE TONIGHT, LIVING CATCHES -- 11 CATCHES. YOU HAVE A FLAG ON THE PLAY. AL: AWAY FROM THE PLATE ITSELF. PROBABLY ON VAN MALLOY. 53 MAY HAVE JUMPED. >> OFFSIDE, DEFENSE, NUMBER 53, LINED UP IN THE NEUTRAL ZONE. , REPLAY SECOND DOWN. AL: THEY WILL TAKE THAT BECAUSE IT MAKES IT SECOND DOWN AND 5. KIRK: TRY TO GET A JUMP AND HE GETS CAUGHT, TRYING TO POKE HIMSELF BACK. AL: SO 50 SECONDS. AT THE 7. BURROW FLUSHED OUT, TO BROWN, AND BROWN IS OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE FIVE YARD LINE, SO CHASE BROWN IS THERE. IT'S GOING TO BE THIRD AND 3. AND AGAIN, HAVE THAT TIMEOUT. AL: -- THEY WILL HOLD ONTO THAT TIMEOUT AND WITH 42 SECONDS AND LAMAR JACKSON AND HIS GROUP OF RECEIVERS AND A KICKER, YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T NEED A TON OF RIGHT NOW, JOE BURROW IS PROBABLY NOT WORRIED ABOUT TIME. HE'S WORRIED ABOUT GETTING THE BALL INTO THE END ZONE AND ITS DECISION TIME. AL: CHASE LINED UP TO THE RIGHT SIDE. PUNTS THAT WAY, THROWS THAT WAY, CHASE, WHAT A NIGHT. THIS IS AS GOOD AS THEIR FIRST MEETING THIS YEAR. IT TURNED OUT TO BE. SO NOW, NOW, IF YOU ARE CINCINNATI, YOU WANT TO GO FOR 2, 1? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO HERE? KIRK: ZAC TAYLOR HAS BEEN AGGRESSIVE ALL NIGHT. AL: THEY WILL GO FOR IT. THEY ARE GOING FOR THE LEAD. I DON'T WANT TO SAY THE WIN YET. THE RAVENS HAVE TO GET THE BALL BACK BUT THEY HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS. KIRK: THERE'S A MATCHUP ALREADY. YOU CAN SEE THAT HE WANTS RIGHT IT IS STEPHENS AGAINST CHASE. HE'S GOT HIM ISOLATED. TAKES IT. THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT. AL: THAT'S INTERESTING. KIRK: ZAC TAYLOR CAME ALL THE WAY DOWN. >> THIRD AND FINAL TIMEOUT. KIRK: LET'S TAKE A PEEK AT THIS TOUCHDOWN, AND ONCE AGAIN, IT'S A GREAT THROW IN A NICE JOB -- AND A NICE JOB, BUT YOU HAVE A ROOKIE CORNER IN WIGGINS AND LINEBACKER AND TWO GUYS THAT TAKE THE FLAG. THE READ AS YOU UNDERNEATH RECEIVER AND A DEEP YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE READING ONLY ONE RECEIVER. SPECTACULAR CATCH BY JA'MARR CHASE ONCE AGAIN. AL: HE WANTED TO SEE WHAT THE DEFENSE HAD. KIRK: NOW THE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FORMATION. AL: TOTALLY. KIRK: THERE YOU GO. THERE GOES CHASE. HE'S GOT IT AGAIN. AL: THE SAME THING. KIRK: TO THE RIGHT, CHASE TO THE LEFT SIDE. TO THE RIGHT SIDE HE GOES. INCOMPLETE AT THE GOAL LINE. WASHINGTON BREAKING IT UP. AND THE RAVENS ARE GOING TO PULL OFF A BIG VICTORY, DOWN BY 14. AL: WATCH GESICKI, WHO HE DIDN'T LOOK TO, BUT WATCH OUT PHYSICAL THIS ROUT IS. THEY GRAB HOLD OF HIM. THAT IS DEFENSIVE HOLDING RIGHT THERE THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE CALLED. AND THERE'S WITH AN UNDERSIZED DEFENSIVE >> ONSIDE KICK. KIRK: THE FRUSTRATING GESICKI THROWING HIS ARMS UP IN THE AIR ASKING WHERE IS THE DEFENSIVE HOLDING CALL? KIRK: I DON'T THINK ZAC TAYLOR WANTED TO GIVE LAMAR JACKSON AN OPPORTUNITY INTO OVERTIME. HE SCORED FOUR STRAI TOUCHDOWNS AND DIDN'T WANT TO ROLL THE DICE. HE SAW THAT IN FIVE AND SAID LET'S TAKE A CHANCE AND TRY TO WIN IT WHILE WE CAN. AL: CINCINNATI HAS DECLARED, WHICH YOU HAVE TO DO THESE DAYS, AN ONSIDE KICK. IT HAS TO GO 10 YARDS. THEIR ONLY CHANCE RIGHT HERE. SO THERE HAVE BEEN 27 ONSIDE KICKS, OF WHICH TWO HAVE BEEN RECOVERED BY THE KICKING TEAM. THAT'S HOW TOUGH IT IS THESE BACK TO THE TWO POINTER WE GO. KIRK: THIS IS AFTER THE THROW AND THE TWO POINT CONVERSION. ANOTHER ONE. AND JOE DUTTON COMPLAIN VERY OFTEN. HE DIDN'T THERE. LOOK AT THAT FOLLOW-THROUGH. AND THEN YOU THROW THAT AND IS A KEY -- AND WHAT DO YOU SEE? >> IT WAS CLEARLY DEFENSIVE HOLDING BEFORE THE PASS WAS IN FLIGHT AND THAT LOOKS FORCIBLE CONTACT TO THE HEAD OF IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED. AL: TOO MANY GAMES END THIS WAY. AL: YOU MISSED CALLS, THE WHOLE THING, SO FRUSTRATING. HE RECOVERS THAT. AND IN A GAME THAT CAME CLOSE TO MATCHING THAT, THE RAVENS WILL DO IT AGAIN AND SWEEP THE SERIES. KIRK: BOTH THESE GAMES CLASSICS. BOTH THESE GAMES WERE EVERYTHING YOU LOVE TO SEE IN DIVISIONAL MATCHUPS. BALTIMORE, TO THEIR CREDIT, YOU KNOW, GREAT TEAMS FIND WAYS TO WIN GAMES. PEOPLE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT BOTH OF THOSE CALLS THERE ON THE TWO POINT CONVERSION. DOESN'T MEAN THEY WOULD HAVE ENDED UP WINNING THE GAM THEY WOULD HAVE DEFINITELY HAD ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY. AL: EVERY WEEK. THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE FINISH LINE AND TAKE THE BALTIMORE RAVENS TO A RECORD OF 7-3. THEIR NEXT GAME AT PITTSBURGH AGAINST THE DIVISION LEADERS AND THE BENGALS NOW ARE 4-6 AND IN DEEP TROUBLE IN TERMS OF THEIR PLAYOFF HOPES. 35-34, BURROW TONIGHT, FOUR TOUCHDOWN PASSES, 428 YARDS. JACKSON AND I, FOUR TOUCHDOWN PASSES, 200 -- JACKSON TONIGHT, FOUR TOUCHDOWN PASSES, 290 THEY LIMITED HENRY TO 68. BUT THE RAVENS GAIN 389 YARDS. TONS OF OFFENSE BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT CAME DOWN TO THAT TWO POINT MISSED CONVERSION.
