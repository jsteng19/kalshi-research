FULL HOUSE AS ALWAYS, AND WE ARE READY TO GO AS WE BEGIN WEEK 13 OF THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE SEASON, WHICH ACTUALLY STARTED LAST NIGHT AND YESTERDAY AFTERNOON WITH THREE GAMES. AND AWAY WE GO WITH GAME NUMBER 4 OF THIS WEEK. CARLSON TO KICK OFF FOR LAS VEGAS. THEY WON THE TOSS, AND THEY HAVE DEFERRED. WANT TO RESET THE PLAY CLOCK, AND AS THEY SAY A VERY LIGHT BREEZE BUT ENOUGH TO BLOW THE BALL OFF THE TEE TO GET STARTED. NICOLE HARDMAN AND SIMONTE ARE BACK TO RECEIVE FOR KANSAS CITY. CARLSON GETS A 10-YARD RUNNING START AND SENDS THE BALL TO THE CORNER OF THE END ZONE. IT'LL BE TAKEN BACK FROM THE GOAL LINE. AND HE WORKS HIS WAY UP TO THE 28 YARD LINE. SO THEY DEFER, WHICH MEANS THEY FACE PATRICK MAHOMES RIGHT OFF THE BAT. PATRICK HAS HAD BETTER SEASONS. HE'S THE FIRST TO SAY IT. BUT WHEN WE TALKED TO HIM THE OTHER DAY HE SAID, HEY, JUST FINDING A WAY TO WIN. THAT INDEED HE'S DONE. HE'S BEEN MUCH BETTER OVER THE LAST FEW GAMES THAN HE WAS URLT EARLY ON. KAREEM HUNT GETS THE BACK HEELED. ISIAH PACHECO HAS BEEN VERY ACTIVE. THE RAIDERS ARE EQUAL TO THAT TASK. IT'LL BE SECOND DOWN. ADAM BUTLER ON THE STOP. >> Kirk: A BIG FOCUS FOR ANYBODY GOING UP AGAINST PATRICK MAHOMES, TRY TO NEGATE THIS RUN GAME. THE CHIEFS LEAD THE NFL IN THIRD DOWN EFFICIENCY, SO YOU WANT TO TRY AND GET HIM BEHIND THE STICKS. GOOD JOB THERE STOPPING THAT RUN GAME AND HUNT HERE EARLY. >> Al: HIS FIRST PASS OF THE THE GAME. OPEN AND ISAIAH WORTHY, ROOKIE OUT OF TEXAS. THEIR FIRST DRAFT CHOICE. WORTHY IS GOOD THERE AT THE FIRST DOWN AT THE 40 YARD LINE. CONDENSED FORMATION. GIVES HIM PLENTY OF ROOM TO THE WORK TO THE OUTSIDE. RAIDERS DROP BACK IN SOFT COVERAGE AND PATRICK MAHOMES AS GOOD AS HE IS SEEING THAT PRE- AND POST-SNAP MOMENT. >> Al: GAIN OF 14. GOOD DROP, GOOD PROTECTION, GOING DEEP DOWNFIELD, AND A LITTLE TOO DEEP FOR JUSTIN WATSON. THEY HAVE A PLETHORA OF -- OF WIDE RECEIVERS, EVEN MINUS HOLLYWOOD BROWN AND EVEN MINUS RASHEED RICE WHO GOT EARLY ON AND THEY PICKED UP HOPKINS. >> Kirk: PLAYING 1st AND 10, NOT USED TO SEEING THAT. PATRICK MAHOMES USED TO SEEING SHELL COVERAGE, MEANING A LOT OF COVERAGE TOO IN FRONT OF HIM. >> Al: KEEPING THE BALL DOWN ON THE LEFT SIDE. KAREEM HUNT UP TO THE 44 YARD LINE. THEY PICKED UP HUNT WHO'D BEEN WITH CLEVELAND OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS WHEN PACHECO GOT HURT. NOW PACHECO IS BACK TODAY, AND WE'LL GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWO MONTHS. >> Kirk: YEAH, IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT OFFENSE WITHOUT WHAT HE BRINGS, THAT EXPLOSIVE NATURE OF HIS RUNNING GAME AND WHAT HE CAN DO. AND I THINK IT ELECTRIFIES THE OFFENSE WILL EVENTUALLY GET A LOOK AT HIM. THESE GUYS, AGAIN, LEAD THE ENTIRE NFL IN THIRD DOWN EFFICIENCY. SEE HOW THEY DO HERE. >> HERE THEY ARE ON A 3rd DOWN AND 8. MAHOMES STEPPING UP, UNDER PRESSURE. THROWS UNDER PRESSURE. COMPLETES IT. TRAVIS KELCE TO THE 45 YARD LINE. HE GOES, BUT THERE'S A FLAG DOWN. A LOT OF ACTION UP FRONT AT THE INCEPTION. >> Kirk: YEAH, HE HAD A FREE PLAY THERE. CHAISSON JUMPED TO HIS LEFT. RECOGNIZED HE HAD THAT FREE PLAY AND DIALS UP HIS MAIN TARGET FOR THE FIRST DOWN. >> Al: CLAY MARTIN, OUR REFEREE TODAY. >> Kirk: WATCH KELCE'S ROUTE. BY THE WAY, HE JUMPED THERE. NOW HE'S JUST PLAYING BACKYARD FOOTBALL. THAT'S NOT EVEN A THAT'S JUST FEELING WITH THE OPENING SPACE IS AND MAHOMES BEING ON TARGET. >> Al: NOW PACHECO. AND THE CROWD RESPONDING, GAVE HIM A GREAT OVATION WHEN HE WAS INTRODUCED BEFORE THE GAME. AND YOU CAN HEAR THE CHEERS RESOUNDING TO THE RETURN OF NUMBER 10. BRINGS SUCH ENERGY. YOU CAN FEEL NOT JUST THE CROWD -- HE'S GOING TO CHECK OUT. NOT JUST THE CROWD, MORE IMPORTANTLY ON THE FIELD. TEAMS, AGAIN, THEY PLAY A LOT OF COVERAGE MEANING THEY WANT TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN FRONT OF THE DEFENSE. THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE MAHOMES A CHANCE TO LET THESE RECEIVERS GET BEHIND HIM, AND THAT'S WHERE THEY'VE MISSED PACHECO, MAKING DEFENSE PAY FOR THAT APPROACH. >> Al: 2nd DOWN AND 6. FAKE TOSS AND A LITTLE SHOVEL PASS TO KAREEM HUNT WHO'S BACK IN PACHECO IN FOR PLAY. FRACTURES FIBULA IN WEEK 2 AGAINST CINCINNATI. THEY'VE HAD THEIR SHARE OF INJURY. OF COURSE EVERY OTHER TEAM IN THE LEAGUE SAYS EXCUSE US. >> Kirk: EXACTLY. ANDY REID PUTS XAVIER NEXT TO MAHOMES AND LINES HIM UP AND GIVES HIM THAT SHOVEL PASS. >> Al: NOW YOU'VE GOT PACHECO LINED UP HERE. IN THE BACK FIELD, TAKES THE HAND-OFF, SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH. FIRST DOWN. COLLISION WITH THE LINEBACKER. AND THAT WAS A COLLISION. RIGHT HERE HE'S GOING TO GET DOWNHILL AND TRY TO KEEP HIM SHORT AGAINST THAT DIAMOND FORMATION. BANG, HITS HIM RIGHT AT THE LINE AND JUST ENOUGH FOR THE FIRST DOWN. >> Al: SPILLANE HAVING AN OUTSTANDING SEASON. PACHECO IS THE RUNNING BACK. PLAY ACTION. SWINGS IT SHORT, INCOMPLETE. 2nd DOWN AND 10. LET'S GO DOWN TO KAYLEE. >> GUYS, I'M TOLD WHEN ISIAH PACHECO ARRIVED TONIGHT HE HAD A FIRE IN HIS EYES. THAT MADE NINE GAMES HE MISSED. IT TOOK A TITANIUM PLATE AND SEVEN SCREWS TO STABILIZE THE BONE IN HIS LOWER SHIN. HE RETURNED LAST WEEK, BUT THEY HELD HIM BACK BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW HARD HE PLAYS. >> Al: SO HERE HE IS STAYING IN. 2nd AND 10, 4 MINUTES INTO THE GAME. CHIEFS ON THE MOVE. DEEP DOWNFIELD. ONE-ON-ONE THERE. ONE-HANDED CATCH NOT MADE BY HOPKINS. ALMOST HAD THE OPPORTUNITY, BUT YOU'VE GOT A FLAG AT THE END OF THE PLAY, SO MAHOMES HAS ALREADY DAIKON HIS TEAM IT'LL BE PASS INTERFERENCE ON JACK JONES. >> Referee: PASS INTERFERENCE DEFENSE NUMBER 18. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. >> Kirk: AGAIN, YOU'RE JUST NOT USED TO SEEING PEOPLE CHALLENGE MAHOMES AND HIS RECEIVERS. I'M SURE HE'S WELCOMING IT. SHOWS YOU THE CONFIDENCE RAIDERS HAVE IN JONES AND OTHERS TO HANG OUT ON THESE ISLANDS. HE DOES A PRETTY GOOD JOB STAYING STEP FOR STEP THERE. HE'S IN PHASE, BUT THE HANDS GOT A LITTLE BIT INVOLVED THERE, AND THE FACT HE'S NOT LOOKING BACK TO FIND THE FOOTBALL PROBABLY IS WHAT DREW THE FOUL. >> Al: ALMOST CAUGHT IT AS WELL. THERE'S AIDAN O'CONNELL AWAITING HIS TURN. BUT THE BALL AT THE 13 QUICK PASS, KELCE MAKES THE GRAB. KELCE TO THE 7 YARD STOPPED THERE BY ISAIAH POLA-MAO. INTERESTING THEY SIT BACK DOWN IN THIS RED AREA WHERE MAHOMES IS ALWAYS LOOKING TO FIND HIS TIGHT ENDS, OF COURSE KELCE. BUT THEY HAD REALLY SOFT COVERAGE, MADE IT SIMPLE FOR MAHOMES TO ABORT ANYBODY ELSE AND IMMEDIATELY GET THE BALL TO TRAVIS KELCE. >> Al: HAVE ALREADY RUN 11 PLAYS. WHEN YOU WIN THE TOSS, WHAT DO YOU DO? YOU DEFER AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU. GOT TO STOP THEM ON THEIR 12th PLAY HERE ON A 2 PD DOWN AND 4. MAHOMES ROLLING AND SPINNING AND TWIRLING AND THE PASS ININCOMPLETE, INTENDED FOR HUNT. 3rd DOWN AND 4. >> Kirk: YEAH, THAT'S THE ONE AREA THAT OBVIOUSLY MAHOMES AND THE CHIEFS, THE BIGGEST CONCERN THEY HAVE IS GIVING HIM ENOUGH TIME. USUALLY IT COMES OFF THE EDGES TODAY AGAINST MAXX CROSBY. THAT'LL BE A GREAT MATCHUP TO SEE IF THEY CAN PROTECT HIM ESPECIALLY IN OBVIOUS PASSING SITUATIONS. THAT TIME IT WAS JUST A GOOD PUSH IN THE INTERIOR THAT TIME. >> Al: PLAYED IN THE SUPER BOWL AGAINST THE RAMS THREE YEARS AGO. SEND HIM IN MOTION. MAHOMES FIRES, AND THAT'S CHIPPED AND TRY TO GET IT TO TO HOPKINS, COVER THERE BY JACK JONES AND THEY'LL HAVE TO SETTLE FOR A FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT WITH A BRAND NEW FIELD GOAL KICKER BECAUSE HARRISON BUTKER IS HURT BACK IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. TRADER KICKED LAST WEEK BUT HE'S HURT NOW. INSIDE LEVERAGE? HE TOOK AWAY THE SLANT. THAT'S JUST A GREAT PLAY BY JONES TO RIGHT BEFORE THE SNAP TAKE ONE OR TWO STEPS INSIDE ALMOST ANTICIPATING THAT QUICK SLANT. AND HE TOOK THAT LEVERAGE AWAY FROM HE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF A CHANCE THERE. >> Al: HERE'S MATTHEW WRIGHT, JUST SIGNED HIM. WE SAW HIM ON THURSDAY NIGHT LARGEST WOOD FIRE COOKERY IN THE UNITED STATES. YOU KNOW THAT? >> Kirk: NO, I DIDN'T. IF ROOM SERVICE WEREN'T SO GOOD, WE COULD HAVE HEADED OVER >> Al: ROOM SERVICE WHERE? ANYWAY, ARROWHEAD STADIUM. >> Kirk: STARTING EARLY HERE. >> Al: SPARKLING DAY. >> Kirk: PLUS HAD A GREAT NIGHT. >> Al: ABSOLUTELY. KICK OFF BOUNDING THROUGH THE END ZONE, AND WE TAKE A LOOK AT AIDAN O'CONNELL. SO HE'S BACK. HE LOST THE JOB TO GARDNER MINSHEW EARLY IN THE SEASON, AND FRACTURED HIS THUMB, AND MINSHEW IS OUT HAVING BROKEN HIS COLLAR BONE LAST WEEK. >> Kirk: HAVING HIS BACK I THINK IT'S BIG. I THINK THIS TEAM LOVES HIS APPROACH. SHOWS UP, FIRST GUY THERE, WORKS HARD. HIS PREPARATION I THINK HAS BURNED THE RESPECT OF HIS TEAMMATES. THE BEST THING HE CAN DO IS HE'S DECISIVE, GETS THE BALL OUT QUICKLY. THEY WANT TO TRY TO RUN THE FOOTBALL. BEEN A PROBLEM ALL YEAR. AND PUT HIM IN A SPOT TO GET IT DOWNFIELD. >> Al: AMEER ABDULLAH THEIR RUNNING BACK. THEY'RE MINUS TWO RUNNING BACKS AMONG OTHER THINGS TODAY. JAKOBI MEYERS WHO ONCE DVONTAYE ADAMS BECAME THE WIDE RECEIVER. >> Kirk: IT REALLY FREED UP NOT JUST JAKOBI MEYERS TO BECOME THE TOP RECEIVER BUT ALSO THIS TEAM TO GET THE BALL TO BROCK BOWERS EVEN MORE. AS GOOD AS A TIGHT END I THINK YOU'LL SEE AS A YOUNG PLAYER IN THE NFL. THEY MOVE HIM AROUND, HE'S GOING TO HAVE A BIG DAY TODAY. >> Al: NUMBER 99. YOU SAW ANTONIO PIERCE TOOK OVER LAST YEAR MIDSEASON, GOT THE JOB ON A PERMANENT BASIS, AND WORKING HIS WAY IS ABDULLAH UP TO THE 40 NOW, MINUS ALEXANDER MADISON, ZAMIR WHITE WOULD BE THEIR TWO TOP GUYS. EVERY TEAM IN THE LEAGUE HAS THEIR SHARE OF INJURIES. THESE GUYS HAVE HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE. REALLY HAVE. WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR TOP BACKS, YOU FIRE YOUR OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR, AND YOU HAVE SCOTT TURNER TAKE OVER. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT. NORA TURNER UP IN THE BOOTH, HIS DAD, AND THESE GUYS ARE DEAD LAST IN THE LEAGUE, GOT TO BE A PRIORITY TONIGHT TO MAKE THIS CHIEFS DEFENSE HAVE TO RESPECT IT. >> Al: WE'RE NIGHT ANIMAL. WE THINK IT'S THE NIGHT, IT'S ACTUALLY THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. I GET THE POINT, THOUGH. IT'S A 4 YARD GAIN HERE. JAKOBI MEYERS. IT'S SO WEIRDS COACHED AND TALKING ABOUT THE UFC TEAM AND TROY AIKMAN, SO MANY GREAT TEAMS HE'S BEEN A PART OF OVER THE YEARS. >> YEAH, HE GAVE THE INDUCTION SPEECH FOR TROY AIKMAN WHEN TROY GOT INTO THE HALL OF FAME. THE BALL IS OUT, BUT THEY'RE GOING TO SAY WITH A FLAG DOWN -- I BELIEVE IT DOWN BY CONTACT THERE AS CONNER CAME IN. SO HE GOT IT TO THE 48 CLAY MARTIN, WE'LL HEAR FROM HIM IN A MOMENT. >> Referee: HOLDING OFFENSE NUMBER 58. 10-YARD PENALTY. SECOND DOWN. >> Al: THAT'S THE ROOKIE OUT OF THE OREGON, SECOND-ROUND PICK. JACKSON POWERS-JOHNSON. JPG. >> Kirk: GETS OVER THE NECK OF WHARTON AND TAKES HIM DOWN. HE'S A NASTY OFFENSIVE LINEMAN. WE SAW HIM PLAY QUITE A BIT IN COLLEGE AT OREGON. GOT A COUPLE ROOKIES STARTING TODAY, THE RIGHT TACKLE, D.J. GLAZE AS WELL. >> Al: SO 2nd AND 16. FROM THE 34 YARD LINE. FOUR-MAN RUSH. FLUSHED OUT, EYES DOWNFIELD. THROWS INTO SOME TRAFFIC IN FRONT OF THE CHIEFS BENCH. AND THAT'S DREW TRANQUILL BREAKING IT UP. DEFENSE COMING IN WITH A BIT OF A CHIP ON THEIR SHOULDER OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS AGAINST BUFFALO AND CAROLINA. THEY GAVE UP MORE POINTS THAN THEY PROBABLY CARE TO DO. SPACKS, A DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, ONE OF THE BEST IN THE NFL WORKING THROUGH SOME THINGS ON THE BACK END BECAUSE OF SOME INJURIES THEMSELVES THEY'VE DEALT WITH, AND THEY WANT TO CRANK THE PRESSURE UP MUCH MORE THAN THEY HAVE HERE THE LAST FEW WEEKS AFTER THIS QUARTERBACK. >> Al: THEY YIELDED 30 TO BUFFALO, AND IN A LOSS YIELDED 27 TO CAROLINA AND WON IT AT THE GUN LAST WEEK. 3rd AND 16. SEND IT OUT TO THE SIDELINE, AND WELL SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN IS BOWERS. SO IT'LL BE 4th DOWN AND 10 AS BOWERS MAKES HIS FIRST GRAB AND 73rd OF THE SEASON. >> Kirk: RAIDERS ARE JUST NOT EQUIPPED ESPECIALLY AGAINST THIS CHIEFS DEFENSE. HAVE A HOLDING CALL, GET BEHINE THE STICKS LIKE THAT, GET INTO THIS OBVIOUS PASSING SITUATIONS AGAINST IT CHIEFS. AND THE PRESSURE THEY HAVE AND THE WAY THEY CAN MATCHUP IN THE BACK END. >> Al: A.J. COLE PUNT. ONE OF THE BEST IN THE LEAGUE, IN FACT. THE NUMBERS PROVE IT. 52.9 HIS AVERAGE. HARDMAN IS THERE, FLAG IS THROWN, AND THE BALL WILL BOUNCE AND GO OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 1 YARD LINE, BUT THERE'S A PENALTY MARKER DOWN. CLAY MARTIN IS BACK. HOLDING CALL ON THE RAIDERS. >> Al: YEAH, WHERE THE -- >> Kirk: THE OUTBACK HAD A HOLDING CALL. SO A GREAT PUNT. JUST TALKED ABOUT HOW GOOD HE IS. >> Referee: DURING THE KICK HOLDING, RECEIVER TEAM NUMBER 53. PENIMENT IS HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL FROM THE END OF THE KICK. TIMEOUT. >> Al: AFTER THIS IT'S ABOUT THE HALF YARD DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT. CHIEFS HAVE THE >> Al: ALL RIGHT, SO WHILE YOU WERE OUT IN THE KITCHEN, HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. WHEN WE LEFT YOU AND WENT TO COMMERCIAL CLAY MARTIN HAD SAID THE PENALTY WAS AGAINST THE CHIEFS. HE MEANT IT WAS AGAINST THE RAIDERS. SO AFTER THE TEAMS HAD GONE DOWN TO THE HALF YARD LINE TO START A CHIEFS DRIVE, HE REALIZED THE PENALTY WAS NOT ON THE CHIEFS. IT WAS ON THE RAIDERS, SO THEY HAD TO REKICK WHILE YOU WERE GONE. WE'RE STILL HERE WITH YOU. THE BALL IS NOW AT THE 23 YARD LINE. TERRY, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT? >> IT'S JUST AN ADMINISTRATIVE ERROR BY THE REFEREE. HE CLEARLY PUNCHED OUT FOR COMMERCIAL, AS WE SAY. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO WAIT FOR TV TO GET BACK BEFORE THEY PUT THE BALL BACK IN PLAY. THEY DIDN'T, WE MISSED THE PLAY. IT CLEARLY WAS ON THE KICKING TEAM, AS YOU SEE RIGHT THERE, NUMBER 53. SO JUST AN ADMINISTRATIVE MISTAKE THAT JUST SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED. >> Kirk: AND A 22 1/2 YARD DIFFERENCE. >> Al: YEAH, AND MAYBE THEY HOLD IT BUT NOT FOR STREAMING. LET ME TELL YOU. ANYWAY, WE'RE ALL CAUGHT UP. AND KANSAS CITY HAS THE BALL IN ITS OWN 23 >> Kirk: AND A GREAT REMINDER IF FOLKS WHO HAVE NOT SEEN A LOT OF THE CHIEFS. THIS TEAM IN THE PAST EARLY YEARS OF MAHOMES, IT WAS ABOUT THE EXPLOSIVE OFFENSE. IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS BECAUSE OF THE STYLE DEFENSE THEY PLAY, IT'S ABOUT SUSTAINING DRIVES. IT'S ABOUT SHORT GAME PASSING GAME, INTERMEDIATE PASSING GAME, RUNNING THE FOOTBALL. LAST DRIVE THEY HAD, WHAT, 14 PLAYS? SO THAT'S KIND OF THE NEW MAHOMES OFFENSE BECAUSE OF THE WAY TEAMS TYPICALLY TRY TO DEFEND THEM AND NOT GIVE HIM THOSE HOMERUN THREATS. >> Al: WELL, THEY'VE HAD 32 DRIVES, I GUESS 33 COUNTING THIS LAST ONE, WHICH WAS 14 PLAYS LEADING TO A FIELD GOAL. THAT'S MOST IN THE THAT'S ALMOST THREE LONG DRIVES PER GAME. >> Kirk: YEAH. AND, AGAIN, IT'S A CREDIT REALLY TO MAHOMES AND RANDY REID FOR ADJUSTING FROM WHERE THEY WERE THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO TO HOW TEAMS NOW DEFEND THEM. THEY'VE HAD TO BECOME MORE PATIENT. THEY'VE COME UP WITH AN ANSWER. INITIALLY IT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE FOR THEM. NOW IT'S WHAT THEY SEE EVERY WEEK, SO IT'S WHAT THEY KNOW. IT FORCES THEM TO BE PATIENT. AND THEY GO TO THEIR RUNNING GAME AND THAT SHORT PASSING GAME, AND YARDS AFTER THE CATCH IS WHAT NOW BECOMES A PREMIUM. >> Al: START THE DRIVE WITH A RUN HERE. A 2-YARD PICKUP FOR KAREEM HUNT. >> Kirk: AND WHAT IT DOES IT REALLY SHOWS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MAHOMES, KELCE, THE OTHER TIGHT END, NOAH GRAY, JUJUSMITH-SCHUSTER, THOSE GUYS COMING THOSE GUYS ARE PART OF THAT INTERMEDIATE PASSING GAME AND FINDING THAT SOFT SPOT IN THE ZONE. BOY, 15 HAS A WAY OF LOCATING YOU AND GETTING THE BALL TO >> Al: 2nd DOWN AND 8. PROTECTION. MAKING THE CATCH, ON THE MOVE. TRAVIS KELCE. >> Kirk: THERE IT IS. >> Al: IT'S SO FUNNY, HE'S GOT THE OTHER TIGHT END NO GRAY WHO'S REALLY COMING INTO HIS OWN AS WELL. SO MUCH OF THIS OFFENSE NOW REVOLVING AROUND THESE TWO GUY. >> Kirk: WATCH DEABLO, A FORMER SAFETY OUT OF COLLEGE. NOBODY CAN STAY WITH THE WAY HE'S RUNNING THAT ROUTE INITIALLY YOU'RE THINKING A SHALLOW CROSS, AND PUTS THE FOOT IN THE GROUND AND WORKS HIGHWAY BACK. AND MAHOMES FINDS HIM QUICKLY FOR THAT FIRST >> Al: MAHOMES, CATCH IS MADE, BREAKING THE TACKLE HERE. JuJu SMITH-SCHUSTER. >> Kirk: AND THE EXTRA YARDAGE AND HOW TEAMS ARE DEFENDING AND THE ANSWER TO THAT THERE IT IS. CUT TO KELCE YARDS AFTER THE CATCH, COME BACK FOR VERY NEXT PLAY GET IT TO JuJu SMITH-SCHUSTER. YARDS AFTER THE CATCH FOR A FIRST DOWN. THIS IS WHO THEY ARE. THIS IS THE CHIEFS FOR THESE LAST COUPLE OF >> Al: ALREADY SIX FIRST DOWNS IN THE FIRST TEN MINUTES OF KAREEM HUNT, SHORT GAIN HERE 2nd AND LONG. >> Kirk: WHAT IT DOES IS PUT EVEN MORE ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE QUARTERBACK BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THAT PATIENT APPROACH. YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE THE BALL DOWN THE FIELD, AND THEN IT ALL COMES DOWN TO WHAT WILL YOU DO IN THE RED ZONE WHEN IT COMES TO EXECUTION? FIRST TIME THEY GOT DOWN THERE THEY HAD TO SETTLE FOR A FIELD GOAL, SO THAT WAS REALLY A RAIDERS WIN ON THAT OPENING DRIVE, EVEN THOUGH THEY ALLOWED THEM TO HAVE THE BALL FOR 14 PLAYS. >> Al: KELCE IN THE RIGHT SLOT. MAHOMES, CHECKS IT DOWN TO NUMBER 1, AND NUMBER ONE PICK AND A FLAG IS DOWN. THAT'S XAVIER WORTHY, RIGHT OUT IN FRONT OF THAT RAIDER BENCH. A BIT OF TAUNTING THERE BUT THE FLAG THROWN AS HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FIRST DEFENSE. THAT PENALTY IS DECLINED. RESULT OF THE PLAY IS A FIRST DOWN. >> Kirk: TALKING TO MARVIN LEWIS YOU AND I PREGAME AND ONE OF THE THINGS HE WAS TELLING US WHO KNOWS DEFENSE BETTER THAN MARVIN LEWIS, HOW DO YOU SLOW KELCE DOWN. HE SAID ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'VE GOT TO GET HANDS ON HIM. THAT'S TOO MANY HANDS. GIVES THEM A HOLD. THEY WANT TO REROUTE AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, TRY TO JAM HIM TO SLOW HIM DOWN. >> Al: PUTTING NOAH GRAY IN AT FULL BACK. MAHOMES, STRAIGHT DROP, THROWS. HERE'S KELCE AGAIN. AND AGAIN ANOTHER FLAG FOR THE MOMENT. TAKES THE BALL TO THE 30-YARD YARD LINE. BUT PENALTY IS AGAINST KANSAS CITY. OFFENSE NUMBER 65. REPLAY THE DOWN. >> Al: SAW HIM LOOKING TO THE BENCH TO SEE WHAT PIERCE WANTED TO DO WITH THE CALL. MATCHUP WITH CROSBY. USUALLY YOU'RE USED TO SEEING HIM ON TAYLOR, THE TACKLE, BUT SMITH KICKS OUT. THAT IS A BATTLE BETWEEN THE TWO. SMITH GOES DOWN, GETS AHOLD OF HIM, AND BRINGS HIM DOWN. >> Al: CROSBY, HE MAKES YOU PLAY ALL DAY EVERY PLAY, DOESN'T HE? >> Kirk: YEP. NEVER COMES OFF THE FIELD. >> Al: HATES TO. 1st AND 20. MAHOMES. OVER THE MIDDLE, CAUGHT. WHO ELSE, KELCE. IN HIS 12th YEAR IN THE LEAGUE, IT'S AMAZING HOW OFTEN HE KEEPS GETTING THEM GAME AFTER GAME. >> Kirk: THE BIG INTERIOR NOSE GUARD ACTUALLY WORKS HIS WAY AROUND TO GET INTO THE POCKET, AND WATCH HOW MAHOMES JUST PATIENTLY WAITS FOR KELCE, KNOWS HE'S GOT SEPARATION RIGHT THERE, ABLE TO BLOCK OUT THAT 320-POUNDER THAT'S ZEROING IN ON HIM AND PUTS IT IN FRONT OF HIM WHERE HE CAN MAKE A PLAY AGAIN AFTER THE CATCH. BEAUTIFUL CHEMISTRY THERE BETWEEN MAHOMES AND KELCE. >> Al: 24 YARDS, AND YOU'VE GOT THE PENALTY HERE COMING UP AGAINST KANSAS CITY WITH A FALSE START. >> Referee: 5 YARD PENALTY FIRST DOWN. >> Al: SO 3 MINUTES TO GO IN THE QUARTER. KANSAS CITY HAS DOMINATED THE QUARTER. TOLD YOU THAT TAYLOR SWIFT PER USUAL IS WATCHING HER MAN. ALREADY OFF TO A GREAT START WITH FOUR CATCHES AND FIVE TARGETS FOR 56 YARDS. >> Kirk: YOU SAID YOU BUMPED INTO HIM ON THE GOT THE HAIR GOING. >> Al: GOT THE HAIRCUT, TOO. LOOKED GREAT. >> Kirk: SAID HE LOOKED EVEN YOUNGER. >> Al: HAD TO DO A DOUBLE TAKE. I SAID WAIT A SECOND, HOW'D YOU GET FIVE YEARS YOUNGER? 1st AND 15. MAHOMES ALL THE WAY TO THE END ZONE AND INCOMPLETED. TALKING ABOUT NOAH GRAY. THINKING BACK TO TWO TIGHT ENDS. REMINDS WHEN BILL BECKCHECK HAD GRONKOWSKI AND HERNANDEZ AND CHANGED EVERYTHING. >> Kirk: WITH THE WAY GRAY IS COMING ON, YOU'RE RIGHT. AS GOOD AS THESE RECEIVERS BECOMING AROUND HIM, WORTHY COMING ON, HOPKINS COMES OVER IN THE TRADE. JuJu SMITH-SCHUSTER, WE KNOW WHAT HE CAN WITH THE WAY GRAY'S LOOKED ESPECIALLY THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS IT'S ANOTHER GREAT OPTION FOR THEM. AND YOU MENTIONED ALREADY LINE-UP IN FULL BACK. >> Al: FOUR TOUCHDOWNS IN THE LAST TWO GAMES. MAHOMES PROTECTED WELL AGAIN. LITTLE TOO HIGH. INTENDED THERE FOR XAVIER WORTHY. 3rd AND 15 WITH 2:00 TO GO IN THE QUARTER. >> Kirk: THIS COULD BE A LITTLE THING LIKE HE WORKS INSIDE, GOT MANNED COVERAGE. JUST MAYBE WORKING ANOTHER YARD OR TWO DEEPER ON THAT ROUTE. HE GOT PUSHED TO INSIDE AGAINST JACK JONES WHO GOT A LITTLE BIT PHYSICAL WITH HIM. AND MAHOMES DOESN'T MISS VERY OFTEN. YOU JUST WONDER WITH THAT CHEMISTRY THEY'RE CONTINUING TO WORK ON, IF THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF WORTHY TRYING TO WORK BACK OUTSIDE ANOTHER COUPLE YARDS >> Al: 3rd AND 15, AND AGAIN YOU'VE GOT MOVEMENT UP FRONT. MORRIS, HE'S THE LEFT TACKLE AND THEY'VE HAD A PROBLEM ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE LINE THIS ONE OF THE REASONS THEY WENT OUT TO ARIZONA AND GOT MAYBE THEIR FUTURE LEFT TACKLE. >> Al: WE'LL SEE WITH D.J. HUMPHRIES, HOPEFULLY WHEN HE GETS HEALTHY AND READY TO GO. WANYA MORRIS, THEY'VE HAD ISSUES PROTECTING ON THE OUTSIDE. HE'S JUST TRYING TO GET A BIT OF HEAD START THERE AND THAT TIME GOT OUT A LITTLE BIT EARLY. >> Al: 3rd AND 20, MAHOMES FLUSHED OUT, EVER DANGEROUS. FIRES AND ALONG THE SIDELINE. INTENDED FOR WATSON. AN INCOMPLETE, OUT OF BOUNDS 4th DOWN NOW. YOU'VE GOT A BRAND NEW COOKER, YOU'VE GOT WRIGHT COMING IN. THEY'RE GOING TO PUNT THEM AND TRY TO PIN THEM BACK. >> Al: THEY WILL. YOU KNOW, IF BUTKER WAS OUT HERE, NOW YOU'RE TALKING 55, EVERYTHING'S IN HIS RANGE. MATT ARAIZA WILL DO THE KICKING, TRY TO PIN HIM DEEP, NOSE DOWN, BACKSPIN ON THE BALL. FAIR CATCH CALL MADE >> Al: ONCE AGAIN, KIRK, I KNOW YOU'RE READY FOR THE ULTIMATE CAT AND MOUSE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT CRIME THRILLER. DETECTIVE ALEX CROSS LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE. THE NEW "CROSS" NOW STREAMING ONLY ON PRIME VIDEO. >> Kirk: GREAT TIMES DURING THE HOLIDAYS WHEN YOU'RE NOT WATCHING FOOTBALL, RIGHT? FOOTBALL IS ALL THE TIME. >> Al: 24/7. FROM THE 8 YARD LINE. RUNNING THEIR SIXTH ALREADY RUN 21. STARTING ON THE GROUND AND ABDULLAH PICKS UP A COUPLE. REMEMBER THIS IS THE TEAM THAT HAD JOSH JACOBS AND LET HIM GO. HOW'S HE DOING? >> Kirk: DOING PR THAT FORCES YOU TO BECOME ONE-DIMENSIONAL WHEN YOU CAN'T RUN A PUTS A LOT ON THAT OFFENSIVE LINE AND A >> Al: ESPECIALLY IN A GAME LIKE THIS, PASS IS CAUGHT. NICE MOVE THERE. A LOT OF SUCCESS >> Kirk: THIS GUY HE IS JUST AN UNDRAFTED ROOKIE FREE AGENT WITH THE PATRIOTS. HANGS THERE FOR A FEW NOW GETS AN OPPORTUNITY IN LAS VEGAS. GOOD JOB OF POSSESSING THAT BALL FIRST AND THEN JUST GETTING NORTH AND SOUTH. WHEN YOU'RE VERY DEEP INSIDE YOUR OWN TERRITORY, YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO GET THAT FIRST DOWN, GET AWAY FROM YOUR OWN GOAL GOOD THROW, GOOD JOB OF GETTING THAT CATCH, AND THEN GETTING THE YARDS AFTER THAT CATCH TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT FIRST. >> Al: THAT'S CHRIS JONES OUT ON THE SIDELINE NEEDING SOME HELMET ADJUSTMENT. AGAIN WORKING HIS WAY. NICE LITTLE MOVE THERE BY ABDULLAH SETTING UP THE 3rd AND SHORT. JUSTIN REED COMES UP TO MAKE THE TACKLE. >> Kirk: YOU'VE GOT TO REALLY ADMIRE WHAT THEY'RE DOING. GOING TO STICK WITH THIS RUNNING GAME AND DEAD RUSHING. SCOTT TURNER AND HIS DAD NORV, THEY'RE TRYING TO GET DOWNHILL NORTH AND SOUTH AND JUST GET YOUR THREE, 4, 5 YARDS. THAT'S POSITIVE GAIN THERE RUNNING THE >> Al: NICE LITTLE FATHER AND SON COMBINATION DURING THE HOLIDAYS. 1st AND 4 FROM LOOKING FOR ROOM, NOTHING THERE. STOP ON 3rd DOWN. ABDULLAH STOP ON McDUFFIE, AND THAT SHOULD TAKE US TO THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER ON THIS BLACK FRIDAY. MEANWHILE, NICK BOLTON IS DOWN, ONE OF THE DEFENSIVE STALWARTS FOR THE KANSAS CITY SO THEY WILL TAKE A >>> MAHOMES HAS ALREADY FOUND FOUR TIMES. WHAT'S YOUR STRATEGY TO LIMIT THAT COMBINATION? >> WE'RE DOUBLING IN THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S REALLY GOOD PLAYERS, SO WE'VE GOT TO DO A BETTER JOB. >> YOUR OFFENSE HAS ONLY HAD THE BALL FOR NINE PLAYS. HOW DO YOU WANT TO ATTACK THE CHIEFS DEFENSE? >> RIGHT AFTER OPPORTUNITY WE'RE MOVING THE BALL TO GET SOME POSITIVE PLAYS. >> Al: AND RIGHT ON CUE, HOW'S THAT. NEED SOME BIG PLAYS, O'CONNELL TO JAKOBI MEYERS ALL THE WAY CHECK THIS ONE OUT. GAIN OF 43. >> Kirk: AND THAT LITTLE MOVEMENT RIGHT THERE I THINK AFFECTS THE COMMUNICATION. THIS IS BUST RIGHT THIS IS JOHNSON STILL FEELING HIS WAY. HE THINKS HE'S GOT SAFETY SUPPORT BEHIND HIM, BUT CONNER'S MANNED UP ON THE INSIDE. GREAT JOB HERE RECOGNIZING THAT. GETTING TO THE O'CONNELL FOR A BIG GAIN HERE. >> Al: RAIDERS FROM THE 29. O'CONNELL, HAS TIME. THROWS INTO TRAFFIC, AND SOMEHOW, SOMEWAY HE COMES UP WITH THAT ONE DOES MEYERS. RISK THROWING THIS THIS JUST SHOWS YOU HOW MUCH TRUST HE HAS IN MEYERS. BUT WHAT HAPPENS HERE IS TRENT McDUFFIE WHO'S VERY GOOD IN SLOT SPOT. HE'S INSIDE WHERE HE'S NORMALLY DOMINANT, WATCH HOW HE NEVER FINDS THE FOOTBALL. GOOD JOB AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, LITTLE INSIDE MOVE, BY THE TIME McDUFFIE IS LOOKING FOR IT MEYERS HAD ALREADY ADJUSTED TO THE INSIDE TO FIND THE FOOTBALL. >> Al: 43 AND TO 24. BACK-TO-BACK TO JAKOBI MEYERS WHO'S SPLIT TO THE LEFT ON A FIRST AND GOAL. WHISTLE BEFORE THE >> Referee: FALSE START, OFFENSE NUMBER 89. 5-YARD PENALTY FIRST >> Al: TIGHT END BROCK BOWERS. >> Kirk: WE CAME IN EXPECTING TO CALL HIS NAME A BUNCH TODAY. WE JUST EVEN SAID FOR HEM TO HANG AROUND IN THIS GAME 89'S GOING TO HAVE TO GET HIS HANDS ON THE BALL. INSTEAD IT'S JAKOBI MEYERS MAKING PLAYS HERE ESPECIALLY ON THIS DRIVE. >> Al: MAHOMES ALWAYS HAS THAT KIND OF IMPASSIVE LOOK ON THE OKAY. >> Kirk: ALL RIGHT, JUST GIVE ME THE BALL >> Al: I'LL GET OUT FIRST AND GOAL. PLAY ACTION, ROLLING, THROWING, CAUGHT. TO THE 4 YARD LINE GOES BROCK BOWERS. DRUE TRANQUILL STOPS HIM THERE. >> Kirk: GETS LOST IN COVERAGE ON THE PLAY ACTION LOOK. LOVE THE AGGRESSIVE CALL THERE BY SCOTT TURNER ON THE -- WELL, WITH THE PENALTY 1st AND 15. >> Al: SAW BOLTON SHAKEN UP AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER. HE'S BACK IN THERE. DRIVE STARTED AT THEIR OWN 8 YARD LINE. 2nd DOWN AND GOAL. BOWERS INTO THE SLOT TO THE RIGHT. PLAY CLOCK AT 1:00. KEEP IT ON THE GROUND. INTO A BRICK WALL GOES ABDULLAH. 3rd AND GOAL. ANTONIO PIERCE DURING THE WEEK GOES, HEY, IT'S THE WORST TEAM IN FOOTBALL AGAINST BEST. HAVE SOME FUN. >> Kirk: RIGHT. WHAT THE HECK? IT SURE HELPS WHEN YOUR QUARTERBACK CAN MAKE A FEW THROWCH DIFFERENCE, GETTING A QUARTERBACK THAT CAN GET THE BALL DOWNFIELD AND BE DECISIVE, NOT HOLDING ONTO IT. POWERS IS GOING TO BE OUT TO HIS RIGHT. >> Al: MEYERS WIDE O'CONNELL IN THE POCKET, BREAKS AWAY. DOWN HE GOES AT THE 9 CHASED DOWN BY CHRIS HADN'T MENTIONED HIS NAME UNTIL NOW, BUT SOONER OR LATER HERE COMES 95. >> Kirk: A MATTER OF TIME ESPECIALLY ON THESE THIRD DOWN SITUATIONS. YOU GET MATCHED UP AGAINST A ROOKIE. BUT THIS IS REALLY AS MUCH ABOUT COVERAGE AS IT IS ANYTHING. THAT AND A RELENTLESS APPROACH BY 95. I THINK HE'S LOOKING INITIALLY TO BROCK BOWERS TO THE RIGHT. NOW HE STEPS UP, THIS IS NOT HIS GAME. CREATING AND GETTING AWAY FROM A PASS RUSH IS NOT WHAT AIDAN O'CONNELL IS KNOWN FOR, AND JONES BRINGS HIM DOWN. >> Al: DANIEL CARLSON FOR THE 27-YARD FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT. KICK IS GOOD. TO TIE IT. JONES WAS HUNGRY, SINCE WEEK 4. SUPER BOWL AS A STARTER. ALL HE'S WON IS THREE. INCREDIBLE TO THINK OF ALL THOSE DRAFTED AND HE'S THE ONLY GUY TO WIN AS A STARTER. AND AS YOU SAID THREE OF THEM. FEEL LIKE HE'S STILL JUST WARMING UP. WHO KNOWS HOW MANY HE'S GOING TO END UP WITH. >> Al: AS MOTIVATED AS EVER. AND YOU TALK ABOUT A MARRIAGE MADE IN HEAVEN. HE AND ANDY REID AND THE WAY THIS ORGANIZATION IS RUN, BETTER. >> Kirk: NOPE. >> Al: SO CARLSON READY TO KICK OFF. GAME TIED 3-3. 4 MINUTES INTO THE SECOND QUART. HARDMAN AND PERYAN ARE BACK FOR KANSAS CITY. FROM THE 1, HARDMAN. UP TO THE 23 YARDLINE YARD RUN AGAINST CAROLINA. HE'S THINKING ON HIS WAY TO THE HIS 33 YARD RUN, IF I HAVE BUTKER I DON'T HAVE TO GET PAST THE 50. BUT WITH THE OTHER GUY KICKING LAST WEEK, I HAD TO GET DEEPER INTO CAROLINA TERRITORY. AND MEANWHILE, STUFFED IN THE BACKFIELD HERE IS MAXX CROSBY TAKING AHOLD OF ISIAH PACHECO. >> Kirk: I THINK IT'S THE HUMILITY, THE PASSION, THE COMPETITIVE SPIRIT, AND HE AND ANDY REID JUST BEING CONNECTED IN A WAY WHERE THEY'RE CONTINUING TO JUST -- YEAH, THEY HAVE A SYSTEM. BUT IT JUST FEELS LIKE THEY'RE CONSTANTLY TWEAKING, CONSTANTLY COMING UP WITH A NEW WRINKLE. IT MAKES IT MORE FUN I THINK FOR THE OFFENSE AROUND HIM. I THINK FOR THE HUMILITY, THOUGH, HOW HE GETS A NEW PLAYER IN, WANTS TO WORK WITH HIM, WANTS TO GET LIKE ALL THE GREAT ONES, THAT COMPETITIVE FIRE IS WHAT SEPARATES HIM FROM THE REST. >> Al: 2nd AND 15. CHECKS IT DOWN HERE, CATCH IS MADE. SHORT GAIN FOR PACHECO AND THIRD DOWN. >> Kirk: THIS RAIDERS DEFENSE AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS, THIS IS EXACTLY HOW ANTONIO PIERCE ENVISIONED IT. THIS IS WHAT HE TALKED ABOUT, HOW HE THOUGHT ABOUT. WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE OPEN HOW DO THEY RANG OPEN HOW DO THEY RHANG AROUND, AND THEY'VE GOT TO COME IN WITH AN ATTITUDE AND BELIEF, AND THEY'VE GOT TO GET MAHOMES BEHIND THE STICKS. AND EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE GIVEN UP SOME YARDS, THEY'VE DONE THEIR JOB IN THE RED MUMOEMS IS GOING TO GET SACKED AT THE 15 YOU TALK ABOUT YOU WIN ON DEFENSE. THAT TIME IT'S K'LAVON CHAISSON. THEY WON WITH TWO DEFENSIVE TOUCHDOWNS LAST YEAR. >> Kirk: THAT'S RIGHT. AND THIS IS THE ISSUE FOR THE CHIEFS. NOT JUST TODAY BUT CHAISSON WITH GREAT HANDS THERE. HE USES IT TO GET AWAY FROM THE TACKLES. MORRIS WHO CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE WITH THE BLIND SIDE. LOOK HOW QUICK HE GOT OFF OF THE LEFT TACKLE AND AROUND HIM. AND MAHOMES NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO GET AWAY FROM THAT PRESSURE. >> Al: SO THE CHIEFS FORCED TO PUNT. 36 YARD LINE, D.J. TURNER COMING TO THE NEAR SIDE, TRYING TO GET AROUND THE CORNER. HE GETS POPPED AT THE 45. JUSTIN REED. AND GET THIS, EVEN ANTONIO PIERCE WHO PLAYED FOR SPAGNUOLO WITH THE GIANTS TOLD US HE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO A BROWN BAG WITH THAT PUDDING INSIDE AFTER THIS GAME. >> Al: THAT WOULD MOTIVATE ME. >> Kirk: NO DOUBT. HEARD ALL WEEK ABOUT HOW MANY GREAT MEALS SHE CAN MAKE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SETUP A LITTLE BIT OF FREE TIME NEXT TIME WE DO THE CHIEFS. >> Al: 1,000%. I'M ALL IN. >> Kirk: HOW ABOUT THE JOB AIDAN O'CONNELL HAS DONE? RAIDERS GOT 3 POINTS, ENVIRONMENT. >> Al: FRACTURED THUMB APPEARS TO BE NO ISSUE. THAT'S ONLY THE SECOND INCOMPLETION. TRY TO HIT BOWERS THERE 2nd AND 10. HE'S RIGHT NOW AS YOU LOOK AT O'CONNELL 7-9 FROM 99 YARDS. >> Kirk: HE HAD THE THUMB THAT TOOK HIM OUT WEEK 7. MINSHEW BACK IN. WATCHING HIM PREGAME HERE, I DON'T THINK IT'S ON HIS MIND. I THINK HE'S PLAYING WITH CONFIDENCE. I THINK HE'S FOCUSED IN ON THE CHIEF AND THE COVERAGE AND DISTRIBUTING THIS >> Al: INTO THE BACKFIELD COMES ONE SINCERE McCORMICK. ROOKIE OUT OF TEXAS, SAN ANTON QUO. O'CONNELL CHASED, LOOK OUT FROM BEHIND. GETS IT AWAY, COMING BACK TO MAKE THE GRAB HERE IS BROCK BOWERS. SO HE COMES BACK. MEANWHILE, JUSTIN REED WAS CHASING O'CONNELL, GOT IT OUT OF THE WAY AND PICKS UP A FEW YARDS HERE. BLITZED FROM HIS BLIND SIDE, AND NOW YOU'VE GOT A MATCHUP YOU LIKE TO SEE. WAS SO MUCH PRESSURE HE COULDN'T GET MUCH ON IT. SO IT BROUGHT THE ROOKIE BACK, BUT A GREAT ADJUSTMENTS BY BOWERS TO GET THE >> Al: GAIN OF 9 THERE, 3rd DOWN AND 1. ON THE CHIEFS SIDE OF THE 50, AND HAND IT, COMES AROUND FROM THE SIDE THAT TIME IS HAD HIM IN MOTION, TACKLED THERE BY JOSHUA WILLIAMS. FIRST DOWN RAIDERS. >> Kirk: THIS KID'S A FREAK. BY THE WAY, THIS IS WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE AS A TRUE FRESHMAN WHEN HE SHOWED UP AT GEORGIA. AND THIS IS LOT OF THE PLAYS HE RAN. HE WOULD RUN THAT JET SWEEP. USUALLY THAT'S A RECEIVER PLAY. THIS GUY AT 6'4", 234 POUNDS HE'S ATHLETIC, EXPLOSIVE, GOES AIRBORNE. JOSH WILLIAMS WONDERED WHERE HE WENT. WENT UP AND OVER FOR OUTGAINED THE CHIEFS BY 22 YARDS TO THIS POINT. McCORMICK. SINCERE McCORMICK TO THE 27 YARD LINE. ROOKIE FREE AGENT. >> Kirk: LIKE TO LOOK AT THIS GUY. AND HE RUNS. HE JUST SHOOK OFF NICK BOLTON. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHO'S BACK IN THE LINE-UP, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE OF THE BETTER LINE BACKERS IN THE NFL, AND HERE'S A GUY JUST TRYING TO MAKE A NAME FOR HIMSELF, JUST TRYING TO GET ANY CARRIES AT ALL. YOU MENTION HIM THIS IS A PRACTICE SQUAD GUY ESSENTIALLY THROUGH THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. LAST WEEK HE GETS BROUGHT UP FIVE CARRIES, RAISED ENOUGH EYEBROWS DETERMINED TO GET HIS HANDS ON A FOOTBALL AGAIN TODAY. >> Al: AND THESE GUYS RUNNING A STORM RIGHT FAKED TO HIM, LOOK OUT, PRESSURE, HAS TO DUMP IT AWAY. THAT TIME KARLAFTIS CAME FLYING THROUGH. JONES IS TRYING TO PLEAD THE CASE IT SHOULD BE GROUNDING. FOR THE MOMENT THERE'S NO FLAG, BUT THERE IS A CONVERSATION. >> Kirk: I THINK A TIGHT END MICHAEL MEYER WAS RIGHT THERE AND FLIPPED IT TO HIM, BUT HE WAS RIGHT THERE'S A TIGHT END RIGHT HERE MICHAEL MEYER. HE'S BLOCKING, LOOKS LIKE A LINEMAN, BUT HE THROWS IT RIGHT AT HIS FEET. >> Referee: INELIGIBLE PLAYER DOWNFIELD. >> Al: AND THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY. SETTING UP A SCREEN AND THOSE LINEMEN ARE GETTING DOWNFIELD. KARLAFTIS DOES A GOOD JOB OF BEING ABLE TO APPLY THAT PRESSURE WHERE THE SCREEN NEVER HAD MUCH OF A CHANCE. IT WAS ON THE RIGHT GUARD, PARHAM. NOW, THESE GUYS ARE JUST TRYING TO RUN A STREAM. THEY'RE NOT EXPECTING THAT PRESSURE TO GET TO THE QUARTERBACK THAT QUICKLY. THEY OF COURSE IDEA. THEY'RE RUNNING THE PLAY CALL. GIVE AN ASTERISK AND A MARK THERE TO KARLAFTIS FOR CAUSING THAT. >> Al: SO 2nd DOWN AND 8 AFTER THE PENALTY. ON THE GROUND AGAIN. 38 YARD LINE. NICK BOLTON MAKES THE TACKLE ON McCORMICK. THIRD DOWN. >> Kirk: AND A BIG PART OF RUNNING THE FOOTBALL IS NOT JUST, HEY, WE WANT TO TAKE THE PRESSURE OFF OUR PROTECTION AND OFFENSIVE LINE, IT'S KEEPING HIM ON THE AGAIN, THEY ARE DEAD LAST IN THE NFL IN RUNNING THE FOOTBALL. AND WITH A NEW COORDINATOR, THEY'RE TRYING TO RUN-DOWN HILL. THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO RUN WIDE OUTSIDE ZONE. THEY'RE TRYING TO RUN DOWNHILL, AND IT'S BEEN EFFECTIVE ENOUGH. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, HERE THEY ARE 3rd AND 4. >> Al: TEAM AVERAGING ONLY 75 YARDS PER THEY HAVE 29 ON 8 CARRIES. O'CONNELL HANGING IN THE POCKET, FIRES OVER, AND NEARLY PICKED OFF. NICK BOLTON WAS RIGHT THERE AT THE 30 TO BREAK IT UP. FOURTH DOWN. >> Kirk: WE JUST TALKED ABOUT BOLTON. THIS IS FANTASTIC. ONE OF THE MORE INTELLIGENT MIDDLE LINE BACKERS. WATCH HIS HEAD THE ENTIRE TIME WITH THESE CROSSERS. MESH ROUTE, HE'S LOOKING LEFT, LOOKING RIGHT, EVERYTHING IN AND STILL THE AWARENESS TO READ THE QUARTERBACK'S EYES AND GET AIRBORNE TO KNOCK THAT FOOTBALL AWAY, OTHERWISE THAT'S A THAT'S A BIG-TIME PLAY BY BOLTON. >> Al: 56 YARDS FOR CARLSON. A.J. COLE TO SPOT IT. AND CARLSON, ONE OF LEAGUE, NO SHORT. SO KANSAS CITY WILL TAKE OVER NEAR MIDFIELD. 5:55 TO THE HALF. 3-3. WATCH, MAD MAX. DOESN'T CARE WHAT THEIR RECORD IS, BRINGS A COMPETITIVE SPIRIT. REALLY SETS THE TONE IN THAT BUILDING FOR THE RAIDERS, AND HE WORKS ON HIS BODY, WORKS ON HIS GAME YEAR-ROUND. LOOK AT THE SACKS, SECOND MOST FROM THAT 2019 DRAFT CLASS, THE DEFENSIVE SNAPS. >> Al: MEANWHILE, THAT DEFENSE NOW FROM KANSAS CITY STARTING AT THE 47. FREE, WIDE OPEN, NOAH GRAY! TO THE 25-YARD LINE HE GOES. TACKLE THERE BY SPILLANE. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GRAY HAD TWO TOUCHDOWN CATCHES OVER HIS FIRST 60 SOME ODD GAMES, HAD FOUR IN THE LAST TWO >> Kirk: YEAH, DONE A GOOD JOB OF LEARNING FROM THE BEST, TRAVIS KELCE. AND TALKING ABOUT CROSBY, HE'S OUT IN COVERAGE. INBIG MAN IN THE MIDDLE PLANNING THE MAHOMES IN THE EYES AND GETS FULL COMPLETELY IN SPACE. >> Al: FROM THE 27 AFTER A GAIN OF 27. MAHOMES, ON THE MOVE, SLIDES TO A STOP. AND MEANWHILE THE CROWD WANTS A FLAG BECAUSE YOU HAD ZACH CARTER COMING IN THERE, BUT NO FLAG. >> Kirk: THEY'RE DOING AN INTERESTING JOB WITH THIS DEFENSE. THAT TIME THEY DROPPED A DEFENSIVE LINEMEN. INSTEAD OF CROSBY, NOW YOU'RE SEEING TYREE WILSON DROP. A LOT OF DIFFERENT LOOKS, TRYING TO CONFUSE. JUST A LITTLE PUSH YOU SEE MAHOMES LIFTING HIS HANDS. AND OF COURSE IT'S CROSBY INVOLVED. ANY TIME, HE'S ALWAYS TRYING TO SEND MESSAGES. AT LEAST MORRIS RESPONDED BY PUSHING HIM OFF. >> Al: THAT'S HOW THE CROWD RESPONDS, TOO. ALWAYS LOOKS WORSE ON BIG BOARD. >> Kirk: IF ANYONE BREATHES ON MAHOMES, THE CROWD IS NOT GOING TO LIKE IT. >> Al: 2nd AND 10. MAHOMES GETS IT AWAY AND KNOCKED DOWN. KNOCKED DOWN THERE BY LAULU, JONAH LAULU. 3rd DOWN AND 10. >> Kirk: HOW DO YOU DEFEND MAHOMES? THE GUY HAS SEEN EVERYBODY USUALLY DROPS COVERAGE, BUT HOW DO YOU DROP COVERAGE? SO ANY KIND OF DIFFERENT WRINKLE YOU CAN GIVE HIM, AND RIGHT NOW PATRICK GRAHAM, THAT'S WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO. MIXING UP LOOKS, TRYING TO MAKE HIM BE PATIENT, TRYING TO CONFUSE HIM WITH SOME OF THE MOVEMENT THEY HAVE ON THAT OSIVE LINE, WHO'S DROPPING INTO COVERAGE. >> Al: MAHOMES, CLEAN POCKET. THE BALL IS SLIPPED FROM KELCE. THAT DIDN'T TAKE LONG. KELCE CATCHES IT AND ALMOST IN ONE MOVE ABLE TO LADDER THE >> Kirk: THAT'S A NO LOOK, THAT'S JUST A THAT'S SOMETHING YOU MESS AROUND WITH IN SO COMFORTABLE ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE ABLE TO UNVEIL THAT AND DO IT IN A GAME. NOT THAT HIGH RISK AT ALL. THAT BALL IS PITCHED PERFECTLY TO PERINE, AND HE GOT THAT FIRST DOWN YARDAGE AFTER THAT PITCH. >> Al: FROM THE 12, ON THE GROUND, PICKING UP ABOUT 4 OR 5. YOU SEE THE GUYS ARE FOOLING AROUND AND SCREWING AROUND IN PRACTICE AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT, WE CAN PULL THIS OFF IN A GAME. >> Kirk: MAN, IT IS JUST -- IT'S ONE THING TO DO IT, BUT DO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT SMOOTH WHEN YOU DO IT? IT'S JUST NO LOOK. OH, MAN. AND HIS BIGGEST FAN I THINK IS PROBABLY A FAN OF THAT PLAY, THEY DID THE SAME THING BACK NOVEMBER 4th AGAINST THE BUCS ON A MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL GAME. >> Al: RIGHT. 2nd AND 6. 3 MINUTES TO THE HALF. MAHOMES THROWS, THAT'S CAUGHT AND THEN GOING TO HIS KNEES AT THAT SPOT IS KELCE. FOR TRAVIS KELCE ALREADY THAT IS A TOTAL OF SIX CATCHES. HE HAD TEN CATCHES IN THEIR FIRST GAME EARLY IN THE SEASON WHEN THE CHIEFS WON 27-20. >> Kirk: YEAH, AND THIS IS THAT RED ZONE AREA WE TALKED ABOUT. THE CHIEFERIZE GOING TO MOVE THE BALL, MAKE THEM SIT BACK AND EXECUTE. WITH 2:30 TO GO IN THE FIRST HALF SO FAR AND ONLY GIVING UP 3 POINTS AND HERE WE ARE AGAIN TO A THIRD DOWN MOMENT HERE FOR >> Al: PERINE THE >> Kirk: WE'VE SEEN MAHOMES AND KELCE OVER THE LAST HOW MANY YEARS, YOU KNOW. THEY JUST SEEM TO ALWAYS HAVE A FEEL. WATCH THE ROUTE. HE KNEW HE HAD A FREE PLAY THERE. I THINK WHAT'S INCREDIBLE SOMETIMES THE ROUTES ARE DESIGNED, AND OTHER TIMES IT'S KELCE FEELING IT AND FINDING THE SPACE AND MAHOMES TRUSTING HIM AND FINDING HIM, AND STILL THROWING IN RHYTHM. THE TIMING IS PERFECT. THEY PLAY MANNED HE ALWAYS GETS SEPARATION. YOU PLAY ZONE, HE FINDS THE VOID IN THE ZONE, AND THAT TIME HE JUST IMP PROVISES AND MAKES THE PLAY TO GET THAT FIRST DOWN DEEPER IN RED TERRITORY. >> Al: SO 3rd AND 4. MAHOMES HIT AS HE THROWS, AND IN THE END TOUCHDOWN. >> Kirk: THIS IS -- I TOLD YOU IN A MEETING IT'S LIKE YOU RUN OUT OF THINGS TO SAY WHEN TIGER WOODS WAS IN HIS PRIME. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE WITH MAHOMES. HE IS ACCURATE. WHAT ARE WE WORRIED ABOUT WITH MAHOMES? THE CONCERN WITH THE LEFT TACKLE. AS HE'S HIT, HE'S ABLE TO MAKE THAT THROW ALMOST AGAINST HIS BODY, AND LOOK AT THAT LOCATION WITH THAT FOOTBALL AND A HECK OF A JOB ON THE BACK END BY WATSON TRYING TO SECURE THAT AS JONES KNOCKS AWAY THAT >> Al: EXTRA POINT BY WRIGHT, HISTORY MADE 238 REGULAR SEASON TOUCHDOWN PASSES FOR THAT MAN, ECLIPSING THE MARK HELD BY L LIN DAWSON. MAHOMES AND THE CHIEFS ON TOP. >> Kirk: WHAT'D YOU SAY MAHOMES OVER THERE LIKE ALL RIGHT. >> Al: THE GREAT LIN DAWSON THE QUARTERBACK FOR THIS TEAM BACK IN THE FIRST SUPER BOWL FOLLOWING THE 1966 SEASON. WITH MAHOMES, YOU JUST GET THE FEELING HEY WHATEVER IT IS, WHEREVER WE ARE -- I MEAN THIS YEAR IN PARTICULAR BUT FIVE GAMES HAVE GONE DOWN TO THE LAST PLAY. >> Kirk: LAST PLAY. EIGHT ONE-POSSESSION LOOK AT THAT, ALMOST AGAINST HIS BODY. AND LOOK AT THE AGAIN, JONES PLAYS THAT FOOTBALL. HE DOESN'T GIVE UP ON WATSON, AGAIN, DESERVES A LOT OF CREDIT FOR BEING ABLE TO HOLD ONTO THAT FOOTBALL BECAUSE HE GOT THAT RIGHT HAND IN THERE TO SEPARATE. ANTONIO PIERCE CALLED THE TIMEOUT WITH GREAT UNDERSTANDING. STILL HAVE THE 2-MINUTE WARNING, TWOTIMEOUTS. FIELD GOAL RANGE AND TRY TO GET THE SECOND HALF. >> Al: AND HE'LL BRING IT OUT TO THE 19 YARD AND START FROM THERE. >> Kirk: STUFF LIKE THAT WE ASK ABOUT -- WE ASK ABOUT WHAT MAKES HIM SO GREAT. THAT'S IT. ON THE SIDELINE AFTER A TOUCHDOWN TALKING TO THE LINEMEN, TALKING TO RECEIVERS, TALKING TO THE BACKS. I MEAN, THAT'S -- THAT'S KIND OF THAT SECRET SAUCE. IT'S NOT JUST THE EXECUTION ON THE FIELD WE ALL MARVEL AT. IT'S WHAT HE DOES IN THE LOCKER ROOM, WHAT HE DOES ON THE SIDELINES, HOW HE COMMUNICATES. MATT NAGY THERE WITH THEY NEVER STOP. IT'S NEVER ENOUGH WITH >> Al: IT'S THE ALL-TIME LOVE AFFAIR IN THIS TOWN, TOO. SO GREAT IN THE COMMUNITY ON EVERY LEVEL AS THE RAIDERS NOW TRY TO CUT INTO THE LEAD BEFORE HALF TO THE 35 YARD LINE GOES McCORMICK, AND THAT'S GOING TO TAKE US TO THE 2-MINUTE WARNING. SO THE RAIDERS STILL HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS. 2 MINUTES TO THE >> Al: AERIAL COVERAGE IS PRESENTED BY ROYAL CARIBBEAN. CHIEFS ON TOP BY A SCORE OF 10-3. IT'LL BE FIRST DOWN FOR THE RAIDERS FROM THE 35 YARD LINE. O'CONNELL 8 OF 11 FROM 108 YARDS. GOING AROUND IS TUCKER. TUCKER DIVING, AND HAS IT'S 11. >> Kirk: YEAH, THEY'VE BEEN RUNNING THE FOOTBALL BETWEEN THE TACKLES. WE TALKED ABOUT THAT'S ONE OF IT CHANGES WITH SCOTT TURNER, GETTING THE BALL DOWNHILL. I'LL TELL YOU, McCORMICK IS DOING A HECK OF A JOB WHEN HE'S IN THERE GETTING SOME PHYSICAL RUNNING. THAT TIME WHEN YOU CAN RUN INSIDE, YOU START TO LULL INTO THINKING IT'S MORE IN THE INTERIOR, AND YOU CAN GET THAT JETS SWEEP GOING AROUND THE EDGE THERE. >> Al: SO THE WORST RUSHING TEAM IN THE LEAGUE HAS 57 YARDS ON THE GROUND, AVERAGING 5.7 PER CARRY. O'CONNELL DOWN THE THAT'S BROKEN UP. D.J. TURNER. IT'S INTERESTING. YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THESE NUMBERS, 57 YARDS ON THE GROUND FOR LAS VEGAS, 10 WITH MEANWHILE, THERE THEY ARE TRYING TO WORK OFF THE TRIFTOFAN HANGOVER. OUR GANG THERE. I GOT YOU, RICHARD. BUT YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT. STATEFARM HALF TIME SHOW COMING UP. 2nd AND 10. ON THE GROUND. FINDS NONE. 3rd DOWN. AND TIMEOUT TAKEN >> Kirk: JUST BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE GET ANALYTICS AND THE STATS, AND YOU THINK ABOUT THIS TEAM. YOU SAID THEY'RE DEAD LAST IN THE NFL. YOU HAVE TO RUN THE MAHOMES HAS 10 YARDS RUSHING. IT'S THE FEWEST YARDS RUSHING IN >> Al: 10-3. KC ON TOP, 3rd DOWN AND 9 NOW. ABDULLAH IN THE BACKFIELD. MEYERS SETS UP IN THE SLOT TO THE LEFT SIDE. PLENTY OF TIME ON THE PLAY CLOCK. UNDER HEAT. DOWN HE GOES. CHRIS JONES, WHO HADN'T HAD A SACK IN TWO MONTHS WITH TWO TODAY. >> Kirk: I ALWAYS FIND IT INTERESTING. WE TALK WITH CHRIS JONES, SUCH A INTERESTING GUY TO TALK TO, AND HE ALWAYS TELLS US, YOU KNOW, ON THIRD DOWN -- HOW ABOUT THAT GET OFF? HE GOES I TRY TO ALMOST FIND THE VICTIM. LIKE WHO AM I FEELING? WHO BASED ON MY FILM STUDY, DO I WANT TO GO AFTER ON THIRD DOWN. HERE HE GOES AFTER THE GLAZE, GETS HIM OFF BALANCE, GETS HIM LEANING AND WINS OFF THAT RIGHT EDGE. AGAIN, I THINK THE QUARTERBACK THAT TIME I THINK HE'S SURPRISED BY HOW QUICKLY BIG 95 GOT TO HIM. >> Al: YEAH. AND THE SNAP DIDN'T HELP EITHER. OFF TO THE RIGHT. COLE TO PUNT. HARDMAN SETS UP AT HIS OWN 10. ANGLED KICK TOWARD THE NEAR SIDE. IT'LL GO OUT OF BOUNDS, AND THEY WILL MARK THAT ONE SOMEWHERE AROUND THE 16 YARD LINE OR THE 15 YARD LINE, AND A FLAG IS DOWN ON THE PLAY AS WELL. >> Referee: PLAYER OUT OF BOUNDS ON A KICK. LAS VEGAS NUMBER 34. KANSAS CITY WILL TACKLE ON THE 5 YARD PENALTY ON THE END OF IT PLAY. IT'S FIRST DOWN. EXACTLY ONE MINUTE TO >> Al: SO NEXT WEEK THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL AND WE'VE GOT A BEAUTY ON PRIME. NEXT THURSDAY NIGHT GREEN BAY, 9-3 AGAINST THE LIONS, 11-1. >> Kirk: THAT'S A GOOD ONE. CANNOT WAIT. BOTH OF THESE TEAMS YESTERDAY DOMINANT. >> Al: SO COMING UP IN SIX NIGHTS AS WE START WEEK 14. MEANWHILE, MAHOMES WITH A MINUTE TO GO GETS SMOTHERED HERE. SO PRESSURE PUT ON. WHISTLED THAT SECOND BROUGHT EVERYBODY THAT ROLLED THE DICE ON 1st AND 10. I THINK THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT FRUSTRATED THAT LAST TRY SEEING MAHOMES HAVING SO MUCH TIME TO THROW THE THIS TIME THEY DIAL IT UP, GET TO HIM, GET IT BEHIND THE STICKS. I THINK AFTER THAT PLAY THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH KILLING THE CLOCK ONE TIMEOUT. THEY'RE IN NO HURRY A LITTLE SHOULDER SHAKE. AND PASS, WIDE OPEN. HOPKINS TO THE 50 YARD LINE, AND NOW THEY'LL TAKE THEIR TIMEOUT. I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED BECAUSE THIS TEAM DOESN'T MATTER WHERE THEY ARE, COULD BE WHENEVER AND WHATEVER IN TERMS OF DISTANCE, AND LET THE CLOCK RUN AND NOW THEY STOP IT AT 18. >> Kirk: SEE THAT BIG HOLE THERE BETWEEN THE CORNER AND THE SAFETY? THE SAFETY'S SO SLOW IN GETTING OVER, THINK HIS EYES WERE IN THE BACK FIELD JUST KIND OF STARING AT MAHOMES AND WAITING TO MAKE A DECISION, BUT HE WAITS UNTIL THE BALL'S IN THE AIR. AND BY THEN IT'S JUST TOO LATE. >> Al: THERE'S WRIGHT WHO WAS PICKED UP OFF THE STREET. LAST WEEK YOU GOT ONE TIMEOUT, FIRST DOWN AT THE 50, GRAY COMING INTO MOTION ON THE INSIDE, MAHOMES WITH A DEEP DROP, SURVEYING, FIRES. OVER THE MIDDLE AND CAUGHT AT THE 40 YARD LINE BY NOAH GRAY. NOW THEY'VE GOT TO GET UP THERE IN A HURRY BECAUSE -- MEANWHILE, YOU'VE GOT A PENALTY WHAT DO YOU GOT HERE? >> Kirk: MAXX CROSBY JUST GOT -- YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT HE HAS TO DEAL WITH, TRIPLE TEAM ON THAT PLAY. YOU'VE GOT A WHISTLE. COULDN'T HAVE TAKEN A CONVERSATION GOING ON TELL US BE QUIET. IT'S GREAT. >> Kirk: HUSH. >> Al: ALL RIGHT, YOU TELL ME. EVEN TERRY IS LOOKING ON FROM STANFORD QUIZZICALLY. >> Kirk: YOU HAD TWO DIFFERENT CALLS. ONE GUY SAYING INCOMPLETE, THE OTHER GUY SAYING CATCH. >> Referee: AFTER EXPEDITED REVIEW IT WAS A CATCH. HE WAS DOWN BY CONTACT WITH 14 SECONDS. BY RULE THIS DOES REQUIRE A 10-SECOND RUNOFF. RESET THE GAME CLOCK TO 4 SECONDS. 4 SECONDS ON THE GAME CLOCK, PLEASE. 4 SECONDS. >> Al: IF THAT'S AN EXPEDITED REVIEW, I'M AN ASTRONAUT. >> Kirk: REPLAY CAME IN AND REVERSED THAT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT A CATCH FOR THE MAHOMES IS GOING TO KILL THE CLOCK HERE. AND THEN SETUP A FIELD CROWD IS BEFUDDLED AS >> Kirk: WELL, IT REVERSES IT TO A RUNNING CLOCK, AND THAT'S WHY THE 10-SECOND RUNOFF. SO NOW YOU'VE GOT A 59-YARD FIELD GOAL. >> Kirk: WELCOME IN, KID, HERE YOU GO. >> Al: HERE YOU GO, MATTHEW WRIGHT, WHO'S BEEN AROUND FOR SIX HE HAS SIGNED ON PRACTICE SQUADS OR ROSTERS 15 DIFFERENT TIMES. AND THIS KICK IS IT'S GOING TO BE RUN BACK FROM THE END ZONE BUT NOT VERY FAR. WELL, THAT IS THE WAY THE HALF ENDS. CROWD DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY IT ENDED. BUT PER USUAL, THEY HAVE THE LEAD. 10-3. KELCE BIG HALF. SIX CATCHES, 63 YARDS. MAHOMES WITH 15-24, 192. WE GO TO KAYLEE. >> COACH, YOU'VE GOT SOME POINTS ON THE BOARD. WHERE DO YOU WANT TO IMPROVE THE SECOND >> WE CAN'T TAKE A STEP BACKWARDS. PENALTIES. HAD A COUPLE SACKS IN DEFENSIVELY GOT TO KEEP THE BECAUSE OF HOW DECISIVE HE CAN BE. WE'LL SEE IF HE CAN DO THAT HERE IN THE SECOND HALF. >> Al: AND HE'S ONLY UTILIZED TWO RECEIVERS. KICK WILL COME DOWN TO THE 3 YARD LINE. TURNER STEPPED IN FRONT OF HIS MATE RIGHT THERE AND GETS SPILLED UP AT THE 20. >> Kirk: WELL, I THINK THE ONE QUESTION WE CAME IN THIS WEEK WAS AIDAN O'CONNELL COMING OFF THAT THUMB SURGERY ON HIS THROWING HAND. HOW WOULD IT HOLD UP? THERE'S BEEN AN ISSUE AT ALL. THE BALL HAS COME OUT CLEAN. THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS BEING ABLE TO SLOW DOWN CHRIS JONES. BUT THAT RIGHT THUMB LOOKS GOOD. REALLY, REALLY STRONG, AND I DON'T THINK THE BALL'S SLIPPED OUT OF I DON'T THINK HE'S HAD ANY ISSUES WITH HIS GRIP. I THINK RIGHT NOW HE'S FOCUSED ON TRYING TO SLOW DOWN THAT PASS RUSH AND CONTINUING TO GIVE HIM TIME TO FIND MEYERS AND BROCK >> Al: FROM THE 25 ON THIS CLOUDLESS 37-DEGREE AFTERNOON. PLAY ACTION, GOOD PASS IS INCOMPLETE. TURNER IN THE AREA, HAD Ph.D.ERS CUTTING ACROSS. 2 PD Dnd DOWN AND 10. >> Kirk: SHOULD MENTION NAZEEH JOHNSON. THEY STILL HAVE JAYDEN OUT WITH A BACK INJURY. HE'S BEEN A MAJORITY OF THE GAME, 13. HE'S HEALTHY AND HE IS FOR NOW ON THE BENCH AND HAS BEEN FOR MOST OF THIS GAME. A LITTLE TOSS BACK ON THE GROUND AND PICKING UP A FIRST DOWN, A GAIN OF 11 IS SO, AGAIN, THE TEAM THAT IS WORST IN THE LEAGUE IN RUSHING JUST ABOUT WITH THEIR PER GAME AVERAGE ALREADY RIGHT NOW. >> Kirk: THEY ARE MIXING UP THEIR LOOKS. ANTONIO PIERCE HAS TO BE VERY PROUD OF WHAT SCOTT TURNER AND NORV TURNER ARE DOING. A LOT OF INTERIOR RUN. THIS TIME THEY GET ABDULLAH OUTSIDE WHERE HE'S GOT SOME QUICKNESS AND GOOD BLOCKING THAT TIME ON THE EDGE TO GET HIM DOWNHILL. THROWING IN THAT DIRECTION, INCOMPLETE. COVERAGE IS GOOD RIGHT YOU'VE GOT JUSTIN REED TAKING CARE OF BROCK IT'LL BE 2nd DOWN AND >> Kirk: JUSTIN REID KNOCKED JAKOBI MEYERS OUT. NOW LOOK AT REID ON COVERAGE ON BOWERS. WHAT A JOB BY THE VETERAN. TAKES ONE GUY OUT BY THROWING THAT SHOULDER AND GETS OUT IN COVERAGE AND TAKES THE ROOKIE OUT. TWO FOR ONE FOR THE SAFETY. >> Al: DOUBLE DUTY FOR REID SEVENTH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE. CAME OVER A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO FROM THE TEXANS. TURNER THE MAN IN MOTION, COMING BACK THE OTHER WAY. HE TAKES THE PASS. DOWN THE SIDELINE HE INTO KANSAS CITY TERRITORY. ALL THE WAY TO THE 39 YARD LINE GOES D.J. TURNER. >> Kirk: THIS IS ALL ON THE QUARTERBACK BECAUSE HE SAW THAT SPAGS LIKES TO OVERHAUL. AND GET THE BALL TO THE OUTSIDE TO TURNER, AND NOW IT'S ONE-ON-ONE OUT THERE. MAKE ONE MAN MISS AND THERE'S NO ONE LEFT. GREAT JOB BY AIDAN O'CONNELL RECOGNIZING THE PRESSURE AND GETTING THE BALL OUT >> Al: A GUY WHO SCORED A TOUCHDOWN IN THE 27-20 LOSS BACK IN VEGAS EARLIER THIS SEASON. KEEPING ON THE GROUND, SPINNING AROUND, ABDULLAH PICKS UP ABOUT 4. NICK BOLTON IN ON THE >> Kirk: THINK ABOUT PLAYING IN THIS DIVISION IN THE AFC WEST WHERE YOU'VE GOT HERBERT WITH THE CHARGERS, OBVIOUSLY WHAT BO NIX IS DOING. YOU TURN ON THE GAME IN THE NFL YOU CAN RIGHT AWAY WHO HAS A CHANCE AND WHO DOESN'T. IF YOU SAQUARTERBACK, YOU'VE GOT NO SHOT. AIDESEN O'CONNELL JUST GIVES THIS OFFENSE, IN MY OPINION, A DIFFERENT FEEL WITH HIM OUT THERE IN COMMAND. >> Al: THERE WAS A WALK ON AND PURDUE ENDED UP SPENDING SIX YEARS IN LAFAYETTE. HAS TIME AND IT'S A LOT OF RED SHIRTS AROUND NUMBER 16, >> Kirk: WHAT A PLAY. WE JUST TALKED ABOUT HOW JOSHUA WILLIAMS IS IN FOR NAZEEH JOHNSON. CAME OUT OF NOWHERE, SEE RIGHT HERE. HE'S IN POSITION PLAYING MATCH GIVES UP ON ONE RECEIVER WHO LEAVES HIS AREA AND FINDS JAKOBI MEYERS COMING OVER FROM THE OTHER REALLY GOOD VISION THAT TIME BY JOSHUA WILLIAMS. >> Al: 3rd DOWN 5. RUN IT. AND PICK UP THE FIRST, >> Kirk: WHAT A CALL. WHAT A CALL. JORDAN MEREDITH, KOLTON MILLER THE LEFT SIDE, THEY GET A DOUBLE-TEAM. I DON'T THINK THE CHIEFS WERE EXPECTING THIS AT ALL. THE ONLY GUY THERE IS THE LINEBACKER NICK THEY GET BOLTON RIGHT THERE AND THAT'S REALLY THE MAIN BLOCK THEY HAD TO MAKE. ONCE THEY GET THE LINEBACKER YOU SEE THEY DOUBLE-TEAM HIM. I THOUGHT THEY'D PICK THAT UP EASILY. >> Al: YEAH, I DID, TOO. YOU SEE PIERCE GOING COME ON, MAN, HE GOT BUT NOW IT'S 4th AND 1. AND -- AND NO. BOLTON IS THERE. SO AFTER ALL THAT, I'M JUST WONDERING IF THAT WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO CALL FOR A CHALLENGE. >> Kirk: I MEAN -- >> Al: THE FIRST ONE. >> Kirk: I THOUGHT AT THE VERY LEAST THEY WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT ANTONIO PIERCE HAD THAT LOOK OF ANGUISH LIKE YOU SAID, YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. AND THEN YOU GET INTO AN OBVIOUS SHORT YARD SITUATION WITH CHRIS JONES AND >> Al: THEY GOT IT GO BACK TO THE THIRD DOWN-PLAY. WITH THE NAKED EYE IT LOOKED LIKE THE FIRST DOWN WAS SECURED. >> Kirk: THEY RECALL ALL OVER IT. >> Al: THE KNEE COMES DOWN HERE AND THERE'S THE KNEE, THERE'S THE BALL, WHICH IS CLEARLY ABOUT A HALF YARD SHY. >> Kirk: WATCH THE INTERIOR BY NADY AND CHRIS JONES. >> Al: CHIEFS NOW START FROM THE 30 YARD WITHOUT STANDING PROTECTION THE PASS IS KELCE WAS THE INTENDED RECEIVER OVER THE >> Kirk: FIRST TIME WE'VE SEEN MAHOMES AND KELCE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE. LOOK HOW MUCH THEY CARE, HOW MUCH THEY COMMUNICATE. THAT'S WHO THEY ARE RIGHT THERE, THE FOCUS ON THE SIDELINES, THE COMMUNICATION. TALK ABOUT A BIG SERIES FOR THE RAIDERS, THEY'RE JUST NOT EQUIPPED TO GET DOWN 17-3 TO MAHOMES AND HAVE A CHANCE TO COME BACK AND WIN THIS >> Al: MAHOMES, THAT'S FIRED, CAUGHT AND THAT'S GRAY. AND NOAH GRAY. SO GRAY'S NOW CAUGHT THREE. KELCE'S CAUGHT SIX. THE TWO TIGHT ENDS HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR OVER 120 YARDS. >> Kirk: SO IF WHEN YOU HAVE SAFETIES, AGAIN, GOING TO SIT BACK, THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF SPACE. AND THESE TIGHT ENDS GOOD AS MANY OF FEELING THE SPACE. NOAH GRAY LEARNED FROM THE BEST IN KELCE. FIND YOU WHEN YOU SIT IN THAT SOFT SPOT. ISAIAH, THERE HE GOES, INSIDE THE 30, PUSHED OUT OF BOUNDS INSIDE THE 20 YARD LINE. HE'S BACK INDEED. AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE WITH THIS OFFENSE. WHAT BLOCKING IN INTERIOR WITH TOONEY AND HUMPHREY AND TREY SMITH CLIMBING UP TO THE NEXT LEVEL. WHEN YOU CAN GET THE HAT ON A HAT AND YOU HAVE TEN BACK THERE. NOTHING AGAINST KAREEM HUNT BUT HE IS MORE OF A THUMPER. THIS GUY BRINGS EXPLOSIVE NATURE OUT OF THIS OFFENSE AND COMPLEMENTS EVERYTHING MAHOMES CAN DO. >> Al: 34 YARDS. 34 TOTAL IN THE GAME TO THIS POINT. AGAIN, MUCHECKO, BROKEN FIBULA WEEK 2, BEEN ON THE MEND, COULDN'T WAIT TO GET BACK AND HERE HE IS. >> Kirk: YOI DON'T KNOW IF HE'S ON A PITCH COUNT OR WHAT IT IS. HE HAS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE STRETCH RUN THE REST OF DECEMBER INTO JANUARY. IF THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE A RUN, THEY NEED HIM HEALTHY. >> Al: ANOTHER LATE ROUND FIND. PUCHECKY SECOND-ROUND PICK OUT OF RUTGERS. 2nd AND 9. MAHOMES, FLAG. DROPS THE BALL, AND SECURES IT BACK AT THE 35 YARD LINE. CHASED BY CROSBY. SEE ABOUT THE CALL GOING TO GO AGAINST >> Referee: ILLEGAL FORMATION, OFFENSE NUMBER 74 WAS IN THE PENALTY'S DECLINED. >> Al: DECLINED OF COURSE BECAUSE IT'S A 20 YARD LOSS. >> Kirk: THIS GETS CALLED ON TAYLOR AS MUCH AS ANYBODY IN THE YOU CAN CALL THE TAYLOR RULE. THE RIGHT TACKLE SETTING UP TOO BIG BECAUSE OF CROSBY. THE RESPECT HE HAS FOR CROSBY AS A PASS RUSHER. THIS IS THE LOOK. YOU'VE SEEN IT CALLED OVER THE NFL. YOU WONDER WHY IT'S AN ILLEGAL FORMATION IS BECAUSE THAT TACKLE IS OFF THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE THAT FAR, AND THAT'S WHERE YOU GOT TO BE FOR IT TO BE ILLEGAL FORPATION. >> Al: YOU MENTION TAYLOR HERE AND -- WELL, NEVER MIND. 3rd AND 30, PASS CAUGHT INSIDE THE SIDELINE AND ALONG GOES DEANDRE HOPKINS. SO IN COMES THE FIELD UNIT. >> Kirk: HOW WE'RE DIGGING OURSELVES HOLES WHETHER IT'S SACKS OR PENALTIES, THAT'S BEEN THE ONE AREA ABLE TO SLOW THIS CHIEFS OFFENSE DOWN IS GETTING THEMSELVES WAY >> Al: SO TO THE 42 YARD LINE -- TO THE 32 YARD LINE, A 42-YARD ATTEMPT HERE FOR THE CHAISSON, MATTHEW WRIGHT. BUTKER OUT, SHRADER KICKED LAST WEEK, HE'S HE'S HURT. WRIGHT COMES OFF THE STREET, AND WRIGHT PUTS IT THROUGH. 42-YARD FIELD GOAL KANSAS CITY ON THIS LAST FRIDAY OF NOVEMBER. >> Kirk: HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED? >> Al: I HAVE. I WAS PART OF THAT >> Kirk: I KNOW YOU WERE PART OF IT. >> Al: I WAS VERY BAD, TOO, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. UP TO THE 30 ON THE RUN BACK. D.J. TURNER RIGHT IN FRONT OF THAT RAIDER BENCH. >> Kirk: I WONDER IF JOHN WAS A GOOD PLAYER IN HIS OWN BACK IN DAY. WANT TO KNOW IF EVER GOT A CHANCE TO PLAY. WE'VE GOT A MAN DOWN >> Al: TURNER. D.J. TURNER IS DOWN. YEP. TRYING TO GET UP. THAT ONE TOUCHDOWN PASS GAME AGAINST THE CHIEFS, SO THEY WORK ON HIM. WITH 8:30 TO GO IN THE THIRD. >> Kirk: YEAH, HE'S GOING TO GET UP. HE'S RIGHT THERE ON HIS OWN SIDELINE. YEAH, THAT BALL -- THAT BALL CAME OUT. RIGHT THERE, JUST BEFORE HE EVEN GOT CONTACT, YOU CAN SEE IT WAS A LITTLE BIT -- THAT LEFT LEG LOOKED LIKE IT HAD AN ISSUE. HOPEFULLY HE'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT THERE, BUT ONE THING ABOUT THE FOOTBALL COMING OUT, YOU KNOW, THIS TEAM IS MINUS 17 IN TURNOVER MARGIN, DEAD LAST IN THE LEAGUE. I DON'T MEAN TO JINX THEY'VE DONE A BETTER JOB TODAY. THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF THE BALL. >> Al: SO HE'S REPLACED BY TERRACE MARSHALL. JUST GOT ACTIVATED AND THAT PASS IS CAUGHT AND TAKEN TO THE 40 YARD LINE THERE BY BROCK BOWERS. >> Kirk: THE GUY WE'VE BEEN WATCHING IS CHRIS WHEN IT COMES TO I WHEN IT COMES TO THE INTERIOR, HE'S BEEN ABLE TO COME AWAY WITH TWO BIG SACKS FOR THIS CHIEFS DEFENSE. LOOKING LIKE CHRIS JONES AS A GAME WRECKER. >> Al: LAST PLAY GAINING 11. TO THE 41. TOSS BACK HERE. NICK BOLTON MAKING THE >> Kirk: YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS, AL. FIRST, HE'S GOT TO BE ABLE TO OUTRUN THE CENTER, THE ROOKIE TRYING TO CLIMB UP TO WATCH HOW HE GETS AWAY FROM THE CENTER, DOES NOW HE'S GOT TO TAKE ON THE POLAR, PUSHES HIM BACK AND THEN MAKES THE TACKLE RIGHT SCRIMMAGE. SO BOTH ROOKIES LEARNED A LESSON THERE AGAINST ONE OF THE SEASONED MIDDLE LINE BACKERS. THE CENTER TRYING TO CLIMB TO HIM, AND THAT RIGHT TACKLE JUST COULD NOT HANDLE HIS POWER WHEN HE CAME THROUGH THERE ON THAT PULL. >> Al: 2nd AND 9. FLIP IT BACK HERE. AND BURIED. McCORMICK TAKEN DOWN THEN JOINED ALONG THE WAY. >> Kirk: AT LEAST THE LAST PLAY THEY TRIED TO BLOCK HIM. THIS TIME THEY DIDN'T BLOCK IT. LAST TIME THEY HAD TWO GUYS ON HIM. THIS TIME NOBODY, SO YOU SET THE EDGE WITH WILLIAMS AND THEN YOU LET THE BIG FELLA 32 BOLTON CLEAN IT UP. BACK-TO-BACK PLAYS BY THE MIDDLE LINEBACKER, THE LEANER OF THIS >> Al: 3rd AND 10. >> Kirk: JONES UP HERE ON THAT EDGE AGAIN. >> Al: THREE SET TO THE RIGHT AND BUT THERE'S A FLAG. LOOKED LIKE -- IT LOOKED LIKE KANSAS CITY WAS OFF SIDE. INDEED. ALL RIGHT, SO 3rd DOWN AND 5 NOW. TRYING TO USE THAT WISDOM OF A VETERAN JUST TRYING TO GUESS THAT SNAP COUNT AND MISSES IT BY JUST ABOUT HALF A BEAT. SO 3rd AND 10 TO NOW 3rd AND 5 FOR O'DONNELL -- OR O'CONNELL, RATHER. >> Al: 6:30 TO GO IN THE THIRD. 10-POINT GAME. GOING DEEP. AND CAN HE ONE-HAND IT? WITH A FLAG THROWN AT THE END OF THE PLAY. BROCK BOWERS PULLING IT IN. I MEAN THE ONE-HANDED CATCH HAS BECOME LIKE EVERY WEEK, EVERY >> Kirk: WATCH AT THE END OF THIS OUT, IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE HOW YOU TRY TO CATCH AN EGG. LIKE EVERYONE'S THROWING EGGS BACK AND FORTH TO EACH OTHER, JUST KIND OF SOFT, JUST KIND OF TAKES THE AIR OFF OF THE BALL AND BRINGS IT IN. AND IT DOES GET THE LEFT HAND IN THERE TO BE ABLE TO HELP HIM REMEMBER THIS GUY IS TIGHT END, A TIGHT END WITH THE SKILL SET OF A WIDE RECEIVER TO FLEX HIM OUT. THAT'S 3rd DOWN AND 5. YOU GET HIM MATCHED UP OUT THERE AGAINST A CORNER AND YOU TAKE THAT SHOT. RECOGNIZING THE MATCHUP, AND HE HITS >> Al: 29 YARDS. IN BUSINESS AT THE 25 OVER THE RIGHT SIDE, GAIN OF A COUPLE. CHRIS JONES STOPPING ABDULLAH ON THAT PLAY. >> Kirk: REMEMBER THEY MISSED A FIELD GOAL IN PLUS TERRITORY, HAD A TURNOVER ON DOWNS. THEY COULD BE MUCH CLOSER IN THIS FOOTBALL GAME DOWN 10, 6 MINUTES TO GO NOW IN THIS GAME. THIS IS A DRIVE THEY'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY TO FINISH. >> Al: BIG, BIG DRIVE. 79 RECEPTIONS. ODEL BECKHAM HAD MORE RESES, RECEPTIONS, 92 THROUGH HIS FIRST 12 GAMES. THIS GUY IS LIKE KELCE 2.0. HE'S THE NEXT KELCE. 2nd AND 7. O'CONNELL FIRES, INTO TRAFFIC, DROPPED. TRY TO GET THAT ONE TO YOU'VE GOT TRANQUILL COVERING ON A PLAY. 3rd AND 7 UPCOMING. MATCHUP THAT IS BETWEEN TRANQUILL AND THAT BALL GOT OUT SO EARLY I THINK IT SURPRISED BOWERS. IT SNUCK UP ON HIM. THAT WAS TIGHT COVERAGE BY TRANQQUAL COVERAGE BY TRANQQUILL THE LINEBACKER. SEE IF HIS SAFETY HELPS OUT. >> Al: RUSHED FOR IT, LOOKS OUT FROM BEHIND, DOWN HE GUYS. LAST THING THEY NEEDED A BIG SACK. KARLAFTIS. SO YOU'RE IN VERY MAKEABLE FIELD GOAL RANGE, AND NOW AFTER A 15-YARD SACK, 4th AND 22. GREAT POINT, AL. KARLAFTIS GETS THE SACK, BUT IT'S REALLY THE COVERAGE. HE EVENTUALLY DOES A GOOD JOB WITH THAT RELENTLESS ATTITUDE. WE WANTED TO SEE HOW IS HE GOING TO FIND A WAY TO GET TO BOWERS. 22, REID JAMS HIM. HE'S TRYING TO DISRUPT THAT TIMING AND WAS LOOKING AT HIM TO THROW THE FOOTBALL. BUT BECAUSE HE JAMMED HIM, HE DISRUPTED THE TIMING. >> Al: 53 YARD FOR THIS ONE EARLIER, THIS ONE IS NO GOOD. MISSED TWO, STILL DOWN BY 10 ULTIMATE GAME. GUYS, IF THE CHIEFS SECURE HOMEFIELD ADVANTAGE, ARROWHEAD COULD BE FRIGID FOR ANYONE WHO ENTERS. >> Al: YOU'D KNOW BETTER THAN ANYBODY, THAT CRAZY WILD CARD GAME AGAINST MIAMI LAST YEAR, KAYLEE WORKING THE SIDELINES. MEANWHILE THE PASS IS DROPPED BY NOAH GRAY. PEOPLE FORGET WITH THE RULE PUT IN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO ONLY ONE TEAM WHEN THEY WENT TO SEVEN TEAMS THEN PLAYOFFS FROM EACH CONFERENCE, ONLY ONE TEAM GETS A BYE. EVERYONE WOULD HAVE TO WIN FOUR INCLUDING THE SUPER BOWL TO LIFT A LOMBARDY. >> Kirk: YEAH IN THIS AFC YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S GOING TO GO DOWN TO THE LAST WEEK OR TWO. PITTSBURGH, BUFFALO, BALTIMORE. IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT RACE TO THE END. >> Al: 2nd AND 10, QUICK PASS. AND THAT'S NOT HAULED IN, SO STRANGELY ENOUGH YOU'VE GOT GRAY AND KELCE, AND NEITHER COULD HOLD ON. >> Kirk: THAT TIME THEY BROUGHT A BLITZ OFF KELCE AND QUICK THROW, EASY THROW ONCE HE'S ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT BY PATRICK MUHOELS, BUT YOU'RE RIGHT, NOT USED TO SEEING THIS. NOAH GRAY ON 1st AND THIS TIME KELCE STARTING IT. GOES TO SHOW AS GOOD AS HE IS, BEST IN THE BUSINESS, JUST STARTS TO LOOK A LITTLE BIT EARLY THERE ON THAT >> Al: THEY'RE LOSING IT, LET'S FACE IT. 3rd AND 10. MAHOMES DEEP DOWN THE LEFT SIDELINE, AND IS IT HAULED IN? YES, IT IS. DEANDRE HOPKINS. >> Kirk: AND WATCH THE OUT AND IN. RICHARDSON DIDN'T REALIZE THE BALL WAS CLOSE TO HIP BECAUSE D. HOP DIDN'T LET HIM. WHAT A GREAT JOB ON THE ROUTE AND THE CATCH THERE ON THAT BIG 3rd AND 10. >> Al: 3rd AND 10 FOR 31 YARDS. THAT'S INCOMPLETE. >> Kirk: PATRICK MAHOMES HAS HAD SOME TYPICAL PATRICK MAHOMES MOMENTS TONIGHT IN THIS AVOIDING THE PRESSURE, CROSBY THERE AT THE END, STILL ABLE TO THROW ACCURATELY AND FINDING KELCE. HERE A LITTLE PUMP AND GO, ABOUT 14, 15 SECONDS IN THE FIRST JONES WITH HIS EYES IN THE BACKFIELD. HERE'S THE NO LOOK, TONGUE OUT, TOUCHDOWN PASS HERE. LOOK AT THE LOCATION OF THAT FOOTBALL. SOMEHOW HAS ENOUGH ON IT AS HE'S BEING HIT TO DELIVER THAT TOUCHDOWN TO WATSON. >> Al: WHO DO YOU THINK OF WHEN YOU THINK OF THE TONGUE OUT? >> Kirk: ONE GUY. >> Al: 23 FOR THE CHICAGO BULLS. CHAT PASS IS GOING DOWN -- NO, IT'S NO GOOD. XAVIER WORTHY SHORT HOPS. >> Kirk: HE PLAYS HIS BEST IN THE CRITICAL MOMENTS. MEANING 3rd DOWN, COMPLETING 70 ERS OF HIS PASSES THIS YEAR. FOURTH QUARTER SAME THING, 70%. HERE WE ARE CLOSE TO THE RED ZONE. LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE A PEEK. THE CROWD IS SAYING IT'S DEFINITELY A DOES WORTHY GET HIS HANDS UNDERNEATH? YEAH, THAT BALL NEVER HIT THE GROUND. THAT'S DEFINITELY A THE GREATEST REPLAY ASSIST. >> Al: IT'S GOOD WHEN IT WORKS, AND IT DOES RIGHT HERE. YOU HAVE TO LIKE WHEN IT'S EXPEDITED FOR SURE INSTEAD OF SCOOTING AROUND FOR 2 MINUTES. WAS A QUICK ONE AND A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 3rd AND 10 AND NOW 3rd AND 3. >> Al: SO 3rd AND 3 NOW AT THE 17. STAYS IN THE BLOCK, MAHOMES UNDER PRESSURE, OVERSHOOTS HIS MAN. HE HAD KELCE. >> Kirk: AGAIN, THEY BROUGHT THE HOUSE. THEY KEEP MIXING THESE LOOKS IN, GOING COVER ZERO, MEANING EVERYBODY'S ON AN ISLAND. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SAFETY SUPPORT. ONE, TWO, THREE, IF YOU, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN. EVERYBODY'S PICKED UP. MAHOMES HAS WHAT HE WANTS WITH KELCE ISOLATED IN A ONE-ON-ONE MATCHUP. JUST NOT ABLE TO HIT HIM HERE IN THIS THAT IS MISMATCH, BUT HE DIDN'T QUITE HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO DELIVER. >> Al: THAT'S A STUFF THE PRESSES STUFF FOR THOSE TWO GUYS. RIGHT NOW FOR THE 35-YARD ATTEMPT. AND DOWN THE MIDDLE FOR HIM. SO WITH 3:11 TO PLAY NOW IN THE THIRD, KANSAS CITY UP 16-3. >> Al: WHEN THE SCHEDULE CAME OUT AND LOOKED AT WEEK 14 WE SAID THAT SHOULD BE A GOOD ONE, PACKERS-LIONS. TURNS OUT IT'S A GREAT ONE, GREEN BAY AT DETROIT NEXT THURSDAY NIGHT ON PRIME. HANG WITH US. TAKE A LOOK AT TIS, A LITTLE FRIENDLY FIRE THE LAST PLAY. SLOW TO GET UP. TOOK A LOOK DURING THE BREAK. SEE ONE OF HIS LINEMEN, ONE OF THE BIG FELLAS THERE. >> Al: SO FLEXING THAT NON-THROWING HAND AS HE GOES TO THE SIDELINE HERE. KICK OFF IS A BOUNCING IT'S FIELDED AT THE 6 YARD LINE BY ABDULLAH. THREADING HIS WAY, AND ABDULLAH WILL TAKE THE BALL INSIDE THE 30 TO THE 25 YARD LINE. AMEER ABDULLAH FINALLY CHAMARRI CONNER. SO IF EVER A GOOD RUN BACK WAS NEEDED, THIS WAS THE POINT. >> Kirk: REALLY AMEER ABDULLAH, THAT'S WHAT HIS CALLING CARD HAS BEEN WITH THE TWO STARTING BACKS OUT, HE'S HAD TO BE THE GUY. LOOK AT THAT MOVE, THAT INITIAL MOVE TO GET HIM STARTED. THEN HE HITS THAT CREASE. GREAT BLOCKING AND THEN IT'S A FOOTRACE. EVENTUALLY CONNERS ABLE TO CHASE HIM WHAT A BIG RETURN HERE FOR THE RAIDERS. LIKE YOU SAID, AL, IN A CRITICAL TIME HERE TO GET THEM BACK INTO THIS GAME, SEE IF THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY. >> Al: 69 YEARS. McCORMICK IS THE RUNNING BACK. FROM THE 26. THE RAIDERS HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF GOOD DRIVES THAT HAVE COME UP EMPTY BACK-TO-BACK. McCORMICK PICKS UP 2. HAD A MISSED FIELD GOAL, TURNOVER ON DOWNS AND ANOTHER MISSED FIELD GOAL, SO OPPORTUNITIES. THEY JUST CAN'T CASH IN. LET'S SEE WHAT THE APPROACH IS HERE WITH SCOTT TURNER AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO COME WINDUP A WAY, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A PLAY THROUGH THE AIR. THEY'VE GOT TO PROTECT THE QUARTERBACK, AND IT'S EITHER GOING TO BE BOWERS AND MEYERS GOING TO HAVE TO WIN. WHETHER IT'S ZONE SETTLING IN THAT SOFT SPOT OR BEING ABLE TO WIN IN MANNED >> Al: O'CONNELL HAS COMPLETED 11 PASSES. 5 TO MEYERS, 5 TO BOWERS, 1 TO TURNER. EMPTIES THE BACKFIELD. GOING FIVE WIDE. 2nd AND 7, UNDER PRESSURE. FLAG. LOOKING TO GET OUT OF BOUNDS AND HE DOES JUST OVER THE FIRST DOWN MARK WITH A FLAG. >> Kirk: IT'S GOING TO BE A HOLDING. >> Al: AS IT NORMALLY IS IN THAT SITUATION. FLAG COMES IN. OFFENSE NUMBER 74, >> Al: KOLTON MILLER THE LEFT TACKLE. >> Kirk: OMENIHU HAS WORKED SO HARD TO COME BACK, APPLYING THE PRESSURE THIS TIM, AND MILLER OMENIHU THERE TO THE INSIDE. THAT RIGHT ARM UP AROUND HIS NECK. >> Al: MAKES IT A 2nd AND 17. 2 MINUTES LEFT IN THE STEPPING UP. HAS A INTO THE END ZONE, TOUCHDOWN BROCK BOWERS! WELL, WE'VE ALL HEARD HE IS SOMETHING SPECIAL, AND NOW HE'S PROVING IT. >> Kirk: HE SURE IS. AGAIN, THIS KID'S BEEN LIKE THIS. HE HASN'T CHANGED A BIT SINCE HE WAS A TRUE FRESHMAN, BODY SIZE. REMEMBER WE TALKED ABOUT DISRUPTING HIM AT IT LINE OF SCRIMMAGE? THEY DIDN'T DO IT CONNERS, THAT IS A TOUGH FOR HIS SIZE. HERE HE'S GETTING ISOLATED AGAINST A BIG TIGHT END, ONE-ON-ONE WOUCH MUCH HELP. AND WHAT A JOB BY O'CONNELL CLIMBING THAT POCKET TO BUY TIME AND PUTTING THE BALL RIGHT ON THE MONEY FOR THAT AFTER THE GAME SNOOP, AMAZON MUSIC LIVE. WHEN THE GAME ENDS LIVE, MUSIC BEGINS ON THIS BLACK FRIDAY. SUN GOING DOWN. KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI, TEMPERATURE IS 36 DEGREES, AND A 6-POINT TO THE 30 AND TO >> GUYS, WE DIDN'T SEE GETTING ANY MEDICAL ATTENTION AFTER HE WALKED OFF THE FIELD SCRUNCHING THAT LEFT FIST. AS HE STUDIED THE TABLET ON THE SIDELINES, HE WAS MASSAGING HIS OWN HAND. HE THEN STOOD UP, TOOK A COUPLE OF PRACTICE THROWS. AND AS HE HANDLED THE BALL WITH HIS LEFT AND THEN THREW WITH THE RIGHT, HE DIDN'T SEE ANY IRRITATION IT SEEMED, AND THERE HE IS TAKING A LOOK AT >> Al: WELL, TAKE A LOOK, KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON HIM FROM THE 30 YARD LINE AS HE STARTS THIS DRIVE WITH A HAND-OFFCH AND ABOUT A 4-YARD PICKUP BY >> Kirk: THE CHIEF HAD THAT RUN BY PACHECO. OUTSIDE OF THAT 9 CARRIES, 11 YARDS. SO THE RAIDERS HAVE DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB OUTSIDE OF THE BIG RUN OF CONTAINING THAT RUN KELCE ALSO BIG FIRST QUARTER. 56 YARDS IN THE FIRST QUARTER ALONE. PATRICK GRAHAM HAS DONE A GOOD JOB PUTTING THE CLAMPS SINCE THAT FIRST QUARTER ONLY 37 YARDS. BUT WE'RE GETTING CLOSE TO THE FOURTH QUARTER WHICH IS WHEN MAHOMES IS KELCE USUALLY TAKE OVER. >> Al: A MINUTE LEFT IN THIS QUARTER. A LITTLE JUMP PASS BUT NOTHING IS HAPPENING MIGHT HAVE BEEN KAREEM HUNT TACKLED THERE BY MAXX CROSBY. A 6 ON THE PLAY. >> Kirk: HE DIALS UP THE LOOKS ON THIS OFFENSIVE LINE. THEY KEEP ATTACKING THAT LEFT SIDE. ONE-ON-ONE OR PRESSURE OFF THE EDGE. CAME OFF THAT NICKEL SPOT. CONFUSING MAHOMES. IT'S CONFUSING THE A 3rd AND 11. WANING SECONDS OF THE DEEP DROP, UNDER PRESSURE, AVOIDS THE SACK. THROW'S OFF BALANCE. DROPPED. HE HAD IT AND IT WAS MAXX CROSBY CHASING HIM, HAD THE FIRST DOWN, EXTENDED THE PASS WAS DROPPED. DROPPED BY HOPKINS. CROSBY -- YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS. CROSBY GETS TO HIM, WORKS AROUND AND PUSHES AROUND TAYLOR. GOOD COVERAGE. LOOK AT HIM, HE'S CLIMBING AROUND HIS ANKLES. SOMEHOW LOCATES HOPKINS AND MAKES THIS THROW RIGHT ON THE MONEY. AND HE'S JUST NOT ABLE TO HOLD ONTO IT. >> Al: SO THE RAIDERS GET EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAD HOPED FOR, 3 AND THE KICK FIELDED AT ABDULLAH, BRINGS IT BACK TO ABOUT THE 31 WITH 5 SECONDS TO PLAY IN THE QUARTER. ARAIZA THAT TIME WITH A PUNT. AFTER THE DROP PASS THE PUNT WAS 52 YARDS. AND THERE'S MAXX WITH THAT FRUSTRATION. >> Kirk: THERE'S JUST WORTH REMINDING PEOPLE WE'VE SAID IT A BUNCH, LET'S CONTINUE TO REMIND PEOPLE THIS CHIEFS TEAM HAS BEEN SO CLOSE. EIGHT TIMES ONE-POSSESSION GAMES. FIVE TIMES THEY'VE WON IN THE LAST PLAY OF O'CONNELL OUTSIDE THE NUMBERS, BETWEEN THE NUMBERS, MUCH BETTER GOING TO THE OUTSIDE. THAT'S OUR NEXT GEN STATS POWERED BY AWS. >> SO FROM THE 31 YARD LINE, THIS DRIVE STARTS ON THE GROUND. SLIPPING TO THE OUTSIDE, TRYING TO GET AROUND THE CORNER, AND HE DOES. NICE GAIN. AND SINCERELY THAT'S THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER, AND KANSA '85 KANSAS CITY BEAT SAINT ST. LOUIS IN 7. AL MICHAELS, HERBSTREIT, KAYLEE HARTUNG TO START THE FOURTH. GETTING FREE AND INTO THE END ZONE. TRE TUCKER. HOLY MACKEREL. THE OAKLAND RAIDERS NOW KNOWN AS THE LAS VEGAS RAIDERS, BUT THIS IS A BLAST FROM THE PAST. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? 58 YARDS. >> Kirk: WHAT A BALL BY AIDAN O'CONNELL. WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT HIM AND WHAT HE'S DOING. FACING SOME PRESSURE, BUT HE'S GETTING BALL OUT, AND HE'S GIVING THESE RECEIVERS A CHANCE. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE SCOTT AND NORV TURNER FOR THIS PLAY CALL AND EMOTION AND HOW THAT MOTION IMPACTED IN CREATING THIS MATCHUP. >> Al: AND STEVE SPAGNUOLO STUNNED AS TUCKER GOT FREE, 58 YARDS, CARLSON TO TRY TO GIVE THE RAIDERS THE LEAD. AND MY MAN IN THE SHADES OF THE OAKLAND RAIDERS RIGHT THERE. YOU NAME IT, THE WHOLE THING. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? >> Kirk: AL, LOOK AT THE HOEGZ WITH THE HOEGMOTION WITH LOOK HOW KANSAS CITY REACTS. NOW YOU HAVE A SPEEDSTER AGAINST A A GREAT BALL BUT GREAT JOB BY TUCKER. MOVE REID OVER, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE RAIDERS WANTED, WHAT A JOB HERE WITH THE SPEED HERE BY TUCKER. HE'S AN UNDERSIZED GUY AT 5'9", BUT A LOT OF TIMES THESE VERTICAL THREATS THEY'RE TALLER, LONGER. THIS GUY'S A LITTLE SHORTER BUT HAS THAT NATURAL FEEL AND O'CONNELL'S GOT TO FEEL SO GOOD WITH HOW HE'S BATTLED BACK IN THIS FOOTBALL GAME TO GIVE THE RAIDERS THE LEAD. AGAIN, SCOTT TURNER, NORV TURNER, WHAT A CALL TO GET HIM ISOLATED TO GIVE O'CONNELL A CHANCE TO MAKE THAT THROW. WHAT A GAME. >> Al: REALLY A COMING OF AGE. THE TURNER FATHER AND SON, IT'S ALMOST A COMING OF AGE GAME HERE FOR O'CONNELL. IF HE BECOMES THE GUY DOWN THE LINE, YOU LOOK BACK TO THIS DAY. >> Kirk: MOST IMPORTANT THING IS YOU LOOK INTO THE EYES THERE OF ONE OF THE BETTER PLAYERS IN THE THIS TEAM'S 2-9. 2-9, THEY'VE LOST 7 IN A ROW. ANTONIO PIERCE SAID HOW MUCH HE'S
