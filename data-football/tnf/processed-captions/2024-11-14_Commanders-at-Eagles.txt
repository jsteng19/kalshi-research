THE GIANTS, DAN QUINN, CONTINUING TO THE SUPER BOWL. A LITTLE BREEZY AND COLD TONIGHT. AT LINCOLN FINANCIAL FIELD. WASHINGTON WINS THE TOSS. THEY HAVE THE THIRD SO RIGHT OFF THE BAT JALEN HURTS WILL BE READY TO GO. CYRUS HAD A GREAT YEAR BUT HE HAS A HIP INJURY, SECOND STRAIGHT GAME AND THE KICK WILL BE DOWN IN THE END ZONE. GO TO WORK AT THE 30 YARD LINE. SO MUCH GOODNESS HAPPENED. 12 TOUCHDOWN PASSES AND 10 TOUCHDOWN RUNS THIS SEASON. A FEW OF THOSE, IT HAS BECOME A STAPLE, HOPE WE SEE ONE TONIGHT. LEFT TACKLE FROM AUSTRALIA, SIGNALING THE OFFENSE OF FRONT. THE SMOKE FROM THE FIREWORKS IS CLEARING AND HERE WE GO. A GOOD PASS TO THE RIGHT SIDE. HE WAS A FIRST ROUND PICK A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, THEY LET HIM GO. HE PICKS UP EIGHT, SECOND AND TWO. KIRK: THEY'VE GOTTEN HEALTHIER, GOOD TO SEE AJAY BROWN AND DEVONTA SMITH BACK AT TIGHT END AND WE SEE THE LEFT TACKLE. RUNNING THE FOOTBALL AND SETTING UP PLAY ACTION FOR JALEN HURTS. THE NEW OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. AL: ON THE INSIDE, JALEN HURTS, THE PRESSURE WAS ON. IT IS THIRD DOWN AND TWO YARDS. FOR PHILADELPHIA. THE OFFENSE OF COORDINATOR WAS IN DALLAS, THEN WENT TO THE CHARGERS AND HE AND JALEN HURTS HAVE CLICKED EXTREMELY WELL. THIRD AND 2 FROM THE 30 EIGHT YARD LINE. STRAIGHT AHEAD, PICKS UP. KIRK: IT WILL BE A GOOD BATTLE TONIGHT, THE WAY IT SHOULD BE WHEN THESE TEAMS GET TOGETHER IN THE TRENCHES, ESPECIALLY IN THE INTERIOR. AL: LEFT GUARD, DICKERSON. A TIMEOUT FOR THE MOMENT. KIRK: BERKELEY FISHING THAT RUN. IT MAY HAVE ROLLED UP ON THE BACK OF HIS NECK. TRYING TO PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN, THIRD AND SHORT AND AS HE GETS TO THE END OF THIS PLAY RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN JUST GOES UP ON THAT RIGHT LEG, WALKING OFF THE FIELD NOW, NOT A WHOLE LOT OF WEIGHT ON IT. AL: TYLER STEEN, SECOND ROUND OUT OF ALABAMA WILL TAKE HIS SPOT. KIRK: DICKERSON HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE BATTLE IN TERMS OF THE LEADERSHIP WITH JASON KELCE AND JURGENSEN, THE CENTER DID A GOOD JOB BUT THEY RELY ON JURGENSEN TO SET THE TONE. AL: HE COMES TO THE BENCH, NICK SIRIANNI ON THE SIDELINE, FIRST DOWN FROM THE 41 YARD LINE. SMITH IS IN MOTION, KEEPING IT ON THE GROUND. SECOND DOWN AND FOUR YARDS BEFORE HE IS PUSHED BACK, THE CROWD WANTS A FLAG BUT THERE IS NONE. SECOND AND SIX. KIRK: I ASSUMED BOBBY WAGONER ON HIS 13TH YEAR, HE HAS BOUNCED AROUND AND HERE HE IS IN WASHINGTON. SAQUON BARKLEY, PLAYED WITH HIM, FIRST TIME THESE TWO HAVE GONE HEAD TO HEAD, FIRST CHANCE TO BRING IT BACK. AL: FLAG ON THE PLAY, SECOND DOWN AND 6, 4 MAN. THROWING, INCOMPLETE, DODSON WAS COVERED, WHAT A GREAT GAME LAST SUNDAY. THIRD DOWN AND SIX. KIRK: DAN QUINN HAS A REPUTATION OF BEING AGGRESSIVE AND COMING AFTER QUARTERBACKS HERE, JUST SITTING BACK AND WE SAW THE LAST PLAY, TRY TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN FRONT OF THEM. TAKING WHAT JALEN HURTS HIGHWAY. AL: DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR OF SEATTLE WINNING THE SUPER BOWL. A THIRD DOWN AND SIX. IN THE POCKET, THROWS, CAUGHT AND FIRST DOWN, AJAY BROWN, BROWN GOT BACK HEALTHY AND HERE THEY GO ON A WINNING STREAK. KIRK: THEY SHOW PRESSURE HAS BEEN BACK, GOOD JOB RECOGNIZING DOES THEM AND SITTING DOWN. AL: AROUND AGAIN, PULLING ITS WAY TO THE 22 YARD LINE, 26. KIRK: BOTH OF THESE TEAMS WILL DO A LOT OF TEMPO, ESPECIALLY IT SIGNIFIES TO JALEN HURTS, HE GETS IT OUT OF HIS HANDS QUICKLY. AL: SAQUON BARKLEY TRIED TO SLIP AWAY, BUT NO. COLTS, NUMBER 96, THE TACKLE THERE. SECOND DOWN AND 11. EXCELLENT WORK CALLING THE PLAYS. AT ONE POINT IT MIGHT BE -- IT LOOKED LIKE HE MIGHT BE THE HEAD COACH IN DALLAS. HE IS FINDING A GOOD HOME HERE. SECOND AND 12, 29 YARD LINE. EXTRA BAND COMING. JALEN HURTS IS FLUSHED OUT, CAUGHT ALONG THE SIDELINE. ANAIS SMITH MAKES THE CATCH. ADRIAN HILL IS THE REFEREE, YOU WILL HEAR HIS VOICE FOR THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT. REFEREE: HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER 77, 10 YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN. KIRK: WITH THE JETS AS A TACKLE, THEY MOVED HIM WHEN HE CAME TO PHILADELPHIA. ONE THING HE GIVES UP IS HIS QUICKNESS. SO SHELTON USES THE QUICKNESS TO GET AROUND HIM, BIG FELLA, GRABS AROUND HIM. INSTEAD THEY TAKE THE PENALTY TO BE SECOND AND 22. AL: DICKERSON TRYING TO WORK HIS WAY BACK. IT SECOND AND 22. AND THEN PRESSURE PUT ON, JALEN HURTS GETS TO THIRD DOWN. KIRK: THE CHALLENGE IS THE PHYSICALITY WITH BERKELEY -- SAQUON BARKLEY. YOU LEAVE YOUR CORNERS ON ISLANDS BUT A LOT OF COVERAGE, SITTING BACK, MAKING JALEN HURTS HOLD THE FOOTBALL. THEY GET DOWN, THE SAFETY. AL: THEY SEND THREE RECEIVERS TO THE RIGHT SIDE. FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT FOR POWELL, ON THE 20 FIVE HE GOES. FOURTH DOWN, 26 YARD LINE. THEY WILL TRY TO MAKE IT 3-0. KIRK: THE POTENTIAL OF THE OFFENSE AND WHAT THEY CAN DO, THE WAY THEY ARE MOVING THE FOOTBALL, PUSHING FROM BEHIND THE STICKS TO SEE IF THEY GET THREE POINTS. AL: THEY GOT HIM OFF THE CINCINNATI PRACTICE SQUAD IN 2017. THE KICK IS NO GOOD. HE HAS MISSED A FEW THIS YEAR IN THE CROWD LETS HIM KNOW. THE COMMANDERS HOLD, THEY KEEP IT SCORELESS, A NEW SERIES CROSS STREAMING NOW ON PRIME VIDEO. MEANWHILE BRIAN ROBERTSON, ON AWAITING, STRUGGLING, OUT OF BOUNDS AFTER A SHORT PICK UP OF FIVE. THERE IS DANIELS. THE GREAT THING, ONLY TO INTERCEPTION AND MEANWHILE ROBINSON GETS THE RUNNING BACKS KIRK: NICE JOB GETTING OF HILL, HE'S THE REAL DEAL. GOING UP AGAINST JUSTIN. SHOWING TREMENDOUS POISE AS A FRESHMAN AND ONLY GETTING BETTER HE IS A POCKET QUARTERBACK ON THIRD DOWN. AL: HE GOES TO LSU AND WINS THE REALLY TREMENDOUS THIS SEASON. I DON'T WANT TO SAY LOST IN THE SHUFFLE BUT HE' SHUFFLE BUT HE'S HAVING A GREAT YEAR. KIRK: OUTSIDE LINEBACKER, EDGE GUY. A LINEBACKER, YOU ROLL THE DICE AND HOPE HE CAN COME THROUGH. AL: -- INTERCEPTION, FUMBLE AND GIANT FANS WENT CRAZY. IT WAS AN UGLY NIGHT. TO THE LEFT SIDE. STILL GOING, CATCHES UP WITH HIM. YOU GOT A LITTLE SCRIMMAGE GOING ON. -- SKIRMISH GOING ON. KIRK: WE KNOW ECKLER IS DANGEROUS OUT OF THE BACKFIELD BUT SACK FIELD, IT'S COMMUNICATION. WATCHING ECKLER MOVE, HE IS OUT THERE ON HIS OWN END HE SO DANGEROUS AFTER THE CATCH. THAT'S JUST A DEFENSE NOT QUITE ON THE SAME PAGE AND TO ME IT LOOKED LIKE THEY JUST DIDN'T TAKE HIM OFF THE MOTION. AL: HERE GOES DAINES, HE WILL RUN AND HE CAN RUN. I WOULD SAY ECKLER, YOU TALKED ABOUT ALL THE PICKUPS ON DEFENSE AND OFFENSE, NO STRANGER TO THE END ZONE. KIRK: HAD GREAT ASSIGN IS THAT FOR COMMANDERS FANS TO SEE JAKE DANIELS RUN THE FOOTBALL? THE LAST FOUR WEEKS THEY'VE BEEN PROTECTED HIM BECAUSE OF THE RIBS WITH THE CAROLINA GAME. HE'S ABLE TO SHOW HE IS OUT TO RUN THE FOOTBALL. AL: AGAIN IN THE BACKFIELD, TO ROBINSON AND ROBINSON WILL TAKE THE BALL TO THE 1-YARD LINE. BRIAN ROBINSON HAS MISSED THE LAST TWO GAMES WITH A HAMSTRING. THREE EXTRA DAYS, GAVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAL ENOUGH. AT THE 1-YARD LINE THEY GO NO-HUDDLE. KIRK: YOU MENTIONED THE TWO BACKS, ONE ONE-WAY AND THE OTHER THE OTHER, THEY SLOWED THE LINEBACKERS DOWN, THEY WERE HESITANT. AL: THIS TIME THEY GIVE IT TO ROBINSON AND HE PUSHES HIS WAY IN AND WILL THEY GIVE IT TO HIM? THEY DO. TOUCHDOWN WASHINGTON. KIRK: THAT IS WHAT THIS OFFENSE HAS MISSED THE LAST COUPLE OF GAMES, NOT HAVING THE BACK THAT CAN POUND TO GET YOU THE TOUGH YARDS. HE STOPPED AT THE TWO OR THREE BLANKENSHIP IS THERE BUT HE WOULD NOT BE DENIED AND GETS A LITTLE HELP. DAN QUINN HAS TO BE FIRED UP. BRIAN ROBINSON WILL BE HELPING OUT THE OFFENSE AND GIVE US THE PHYSICALITY THEY'VE BEEN MISSING. AL: GONZALEZ, PERFECT DAY LAST WEEK. THAT WAS QUICK, TWO MINUTES, 58 7-0. A COUPLE OF WINS, THEY COULD BE 11-0 GOING INTO THE GAME, WE WILL SEE. THAT'S THE DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING ON PRIME. KIRK: WHAT KIND OF INTENSITY DOES DAN QUINN INTO THE FRANCHISE? EVERY PERSON YOU TALK TO, THE COMMANDERS A YEAR AGO, IT'S A COMPLETE ABOUT-FACE AS FAR AS THE DIRECTION THE FRANCHISE IS HEADING. NEW OWNERSHIP, NEW GM, NEW QUARTERBACK, NEW HEAD COACH, NEW SYSTEM. THERE'S A LOT TO LIKE ABOUT WHAT THESE GUYS ARE DOING. AL: HE CAME OVER FROM SAN FRANCISCO. SHIPLEY ON THE RUN BACK, A GOOD RUN BACK BEFORE HE'S TAKEN OUT OF BOUNDS. KAYLEE: WE HEAR IT EVERY WEEK, PLAYING ON A QUICK TURNAROUND IS NEVER EASY SO DAN QUINN TOLD THE COMMANDERS IT IS SHARK WEEK. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW BATTERED OR SORE THEY ARE, YOU HAVE TO KEEP ACTING LIKE SHARKS DO. REALLY TURNED HIM UP WHEN HE STARTED PREACHING THE MONDAY. HE WAS SHOWING THE TEAM CLIPS FROM JAWS AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA NEED A BIGGER BOAT. AL: HE WOULD BE A CANDIDATE FOR SHARK TANK AS WELL I GUESS. WILL BE. AL: JALEN HURTS TO GO WITH 320 IN THE OPENING QUARTER. WASHINGTON UP 7-0. THROWING DOWN THE SIDELINE AND THAT IS COMPLETE TO DEVONTA SMITH. ANOTHER GUY WHO WON A HEISMAN TROPHY. KIRK: USUALLY VERY SHORTHANDED AND I THINK AT THAT TIME THEY BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT HIS FEET AND CATCHING THE FOOTBALL. ONE THING ABOUT DAN QUINN, YOU ARE LIKE THIS, I WANT A SHORT WEEK, ANYTHING YOU BRING IT TO HIM HE TURNS INTO A POSITIVE. HE WILL ALWAYS FIND A WAY TO DEFLECT AND BE POSITIVE ABOUT SOMETHING. AL: HE IS INTENSE BUT A LOT OF FUN TO BE AROUND. I'VE KNOWN HIM A LONG TIME, A GOOD MAN. COACHED ATLANTA FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. OUT TO THE 43 YARD LINE DOES KIRK: TIED INTO A REALLY GOOD JOB ON THE PERIMETER IN THE RUN GAME. THE OFFENSE IS DEPENDENT ON THEIR ABILITY TO RUN THE FOOTBALL. WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE GOOD PLAY ON WHAT THEY CAN DO DOWNFIELD AND THAT IS PART OF IT BUT IT STARTS WITH WHAT THEY DO WITH THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE THE LAST FIVE WEEKS. RUN THE FOOTBALL TO SAQUON BARKLEY, OCCASIONALLY JALEN HURTS, GET THE DEFENSE, WORRY ABOUT THE RUN GAME AND THE ACTION AND THEN YOU TAKE SHOTS DOWNFIELD. AL: 2.5 LEFT IN THE QUARTER, THIRD DOWN AND 4. TO THE 48 YARD LINE, THAT'S DOTSON WHO CAME OVER FROM WASHINGTON A COUPLE YEARS AGO. DRAFTED IN THE FIRST ROUND. KIRK: JALEN HURTS CAN GO RIGHT OR LEFT, YOU SAW THE SOFT COVERAGE HE HAD TO THROW UP YOUR BERKELEY COMES IN AS A ROOKIE. ANGIE BROWN WITH MOVEMENT, SITS IN THE OPEN SPOT AND HE'S ALONE. IF YOU HAPPEN TO LOOK LEFT, THAT'S A FIRST DOWN. SOFT COVERAGE AGAINST THE ROOKIE CORNER AND IT DOESN'T WORK OUT. AL: BRADEN MANN, HIS SECOND PUNT. FIRST WAS 38 YARDS. HE'S BACK THERE, DRIFTING. FALLS TO THE EIGHT YARD LINE. 18 WITH A FLAG DOWN. ADRIAN HILL WILL CHECK WITH HIS COHORT. AS WE MOVE ALONG, THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. HOW WAS THAT? [LAUGHTER] KIRK: TEAMWORK. >> FOUL, FIRST DOWN WASHINGTON. 2:15 LEFT IN THE FIRST QUARTER AND COMMANDERS ON TOP YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO TIME THEY GOT INTO DOUBLE FIGURES. IN THE BACKFIELD NOW. FROM THE END ZONE, LOOKING, THROWING. A TACKLE BY DARIUS SLAY. KAYLEE: DANIELS TOLD US THAT WE MAY SEE HIM GRIMACE IN PAIN, HE'S CONTINUING TO PLAY FROM THE INJURY HE SUFFERED AGAINST CAROLINA. YOU SEE HIM JUST BEFORE THIS DRIVE, THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF PROTECTION HE IS WEARING, CARBON FIBER PAD. HE'S BEEN TELLING US THERE ARE NO LIMITATIONS. AL: SECOND DOWN AND 11. GIVE IT TO ECKLER AND ECKLER BOUNCING HIS WAY TO ABOUT THE 11 KIRK: THEY CONTINUE TO GO WITH THE TWO BACKS IN THE BACKYARD, THEY'VE DONE THAT MORE THAN ANYONE IN THE ENTIRE NFL THIS EUROPE YOU ALREADY USING EIGHT OF THE NINE SNAPS. GIVE HIM ANOTHER WEAPON WHEN YOU GET A HEALTHY BRIAN ROBINSON. AL: THIRD AND 5. ECKLER IN THE BACKFIELD WITH DANIELS. SHOWING BLITZ OF BACK. DANIELS WILL RUN. TAKEN DOWN AT THE 11 YARD LINE. FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: HE'S PLAYING A SPY BUT ALSO AWARE OF FIRST DOWN. WHILE HE'S HERE, HE PLAYED AGAINST THE QUARTERBACK AT THE SEC, HE WAS AT GEORGIA AND LSU, AND HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S CAPABLE OF DOING AND RIGHT WHERE HE NEEDS TO BE ON THIRD DOWN. AL: HIS SECOND PUNT. HIS FIRST ONE WAS 51 YARDS. COMING UP, MAKING THE GRAB AND ON THE RUN AT THE 45 YARD LINE. AGAIN WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT WASHINGTON, NOT ONLY HAVE THEY MADE THESE MOVES, NEW HEAD COACH, BUT ALMOST EVERY MOVE THEY'VE MADE HAS BROUGHT A LOT OF CREDIBILITY. KIRK: THEY KNEW WITH WHAT THEY INHERITED THINGS HAD A CHANGE GOOD THEY WENT THROUGH THE YEAR LAST YEAR, HIRED A GREAT COACH AND CHANGE THE CULTURE. I THINK PICKING UP JAYDEN DANIELS YOU KNOW WHAT THAT DOES YOU GET A QUARTERBACK YOUR ENTIRE FRANCHISE BELIEVES IN. THEY SAY BEHIND CLOSED DOORS HOW HE TREATS EVERYBODY HAS BEEN ALSO A GAME CHANGER. IT'S NOT JUST WHAT HE DOES ON THE FIELD. AL: THREE YEARS AT A AS YOU STATE INTO THAN TWO AT LSU. A LITTLE BIT OF EXPERIENCE. BERKELEY BEHIND. JALEN HURTS. SAQUON WILL TAKE IT AND END THE FIRST QUARTER. IT IS THE END 7-2 COMING IN AGAINST THE BROWNS. A VERY TIGHT RACE IN THE AFC NORTH. THEY ARE TRYING TO STAY IN THE TOP. PITTSBURGH AND CLEVELAND, ALWAYS A GREAT RIVALRY, NEXT THURSDAY NIGHT. SECOND DOWN AND 3 AS WE START THE SECOND QUARTER. FROM THE 41-YARD LINE. SAQUON BARKLEY TURNS AND BACK. HE'S CARRIED EIGHT TIMES FOR 29. THIRD AND 1. KIRK: I TELL YOU FRANKIE LUVU COMING FROM CAROLINA, HE DOES SO MUCH IN HIS DAN QUINN DEFENSE THAT HE MAKES PLAYS LIKE THAT AGAINST A RUN, THEY BLITZED HIM OFF THE EDGE, LINE HIM UP ON THIRD DOWN, JUST A BUNCH. KEEP AN EYE ON 4 TONIGHT. AL: THEY WILL HAVE TO PUSH INSTEAD. IT IS SAQUON BARKLEY. PICKS UP A FIRST DOWN. KIRK: A GOOD CHANGE OF, ANY TIME THEY CAN IN THE FORMATION, HE SAYS IT IS GOING TO WORK AND A QUICK FLIP TO THE OUTSIDE. IF THE DEFENSE OVER COMMITS AND PINCHES INTO THE OUTSIDE TO START -- STOP JALEN HURTS, BERKELEY -- SAQUON BARKLEY IS OFF TO THE RACES. THE EASY ROUTE THEY GO FOR THOSE FIRST DOWNS. AL: THE BLOCK FROM GUNNAR, THE TIGHT END. BROWN WIDE RIGHT. A LITTLE TRICKERY BUT NOTHING DOING. WAS THAT SPELLED OUT PERFECTLY. WE HAVE FRANKIE LUVU, NOT EVEN CLOSE, THAT'S A LOSS OF 14. KIRK: AND FEELS LIKE THE TIMING OF THIS HAPPENED TOO FAST. THE DEFENSE DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO FOLLOW SAQUON BARKLEY. LUVU YOU SEE BUT YOU WOULD LOVE TO SEE SAQUON BARKLEY TAKE SOME MORE STEPS TO DRAW THE DEFENSE TO HIM BUT IT HAPPENED SO QUICKLY THAT THE DEFENSE DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO REACT TO SAQUON BARKLEY RUNNING TO THE LEFT. THERE IS LUVU AGAIN MAKING A PLAY. AL: HE WILL TAKE IT TO ABOUT THE 42 YARD LINE, SETTING UP FOR THIRD AND LONG. KIRK: JOE WHITCOMB OF THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, A LOT OF TIMES HAS OFFENSE IN THE PITS, IT HAS ALLOWED HIM TO SIT BACK AND PLAYING MORE COVERAGE. NOT HAVING TO BLITZ. THE GOAL TONIGHT FOR THE COMMANDERS IS TO TRY TO PROTECT THEIR CORNERS AS MUCH AS THEY CAN AND THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT SO FAR TONIGHT. AL: IN THE BACKFIELD, PHILLY ONLY AVERAGING THREE YARDS PER THAT IS CAUGHT BUT TAKEN DOWN. HE GETS THE BALL INTO FIELD GOAL RANGE. LINE OF SCRIMMAGE IS GOING TO BE 33. YOU HAVE AN ATTEMPT BY ELLIOTT WHO HAS NOT MADE A 50 YARD FIELD GOAL THIS SEASON. THIS ONE FROM 51. MR. EARLIER FROM 44 -- MISSED EARLIER FROM 44. CAN HE MAKE IT FROM 51? KICK ON THE WAY. NOPE. 0-2. IT REMAINS 7-0. AL: THE TWO LINEBACKERS FOR PHILLY DEFENSE HAS BEEN A STORY ALL YEAR. WE TALK ABOUT ZACK BAUN COMING FROM NEW ORLEANS AND MOVING INTO THE LINEBACKER SPOT. HASN'T PLAYED A LOT IN THIS POSITION SO HE'S BEEN A MAJOR ADDITION. THIS GUY, WATCHING HIM AND GEORGE, ONE OF THE BEST LEADERS I'VE SEEN. THOSE TWO HAVE MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR THE EAGLES DEFENSE. AL: THE TWO TOP TACKLERS ON THE TEAM. LOOK OUT. SPENDS. DOWN AT THE 37 WITH YARD LINE -- THE 37 YARD LINE. BRANDON WITH YEARS IN THE LEAGUE, NUMBER ONE DRAFT PICK IN 2010. KIRK: WITH HIS ATHLETIC ABILITY, TRYING TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT, INSTEAD OF TAKING A LOSS BIT EVERYBODY TAKING AWAY WHICH ALLOWED GRAHAM TO GET HOME. AL: SECOND AND 14. UNDER PRESSURE AGAIN. SWUNG DOWN TO THE 29 YARD LINE. JOSH SWEAT. WORKING UP SOME SWEAT. KIRK: HECK OF A BATTLE, NOT JUST WHEN THE COMMANDERS ARE RUNNING. WHEN THEY HAVE TO PROTECT THEIR QUARTERBACK. LAST WAS A COVERAGE SACK AND THIS TIME JALEN CARTER FORCES IT. WATCH THE MOVE, THE CLUB, AND HE HAS QUICKNESS TO AFFECT THAT QUARTERBACK AND MAKE SOME STEP AWAY. THE TANDEM WITH SWEAT TO GET THE SACK. AL: BROUGHT THE CROWD TO LIFE ON THIRD AND 22. KEEP IT ON THE GROUND. ROBINSON STOPPING AT THE 35 WITH A FLAG DOWN. TWO FLAGS ARE DOWN. >> PENALTY IS DECLINED, FOURTH DOWN. KIRK: THAT IS THEIR PLAN GET JAKE BEHIND THE STICKS, DON'T LET HIS CREATIVITY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE GAME, KEEP THEM IN THE POCKET. YOU SEE SWEAT PLAYING OFF JALEN CARTER. AL: PITTSBURGH DID THAT LAST WEEK AND HAD A GREAT JOB OF IT. HERE IS SWEAT, HIS THIRD KICK OF THE NIGHT. GOING TO LET IT GO, SWIMS OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 26 YARD LINE. 51 TO THE HAVEHE WILL GO DOWN IN MEMORY FOREVER WITH THAT SECOND THE SUPER BOWL. THE EAGLES, THIS FIELD GOAL IN A COUPLE OF PUNTS AND ANOTHER. THIS THREE-POINT ATTEMPT. FROM THEIR OWN 26 YARD LINE. 25 PLAYS FOR 86 YARDS. SECOND AND FOUR. KIRK: TALKING TO JALEN HURTS WHEN THE EAGLES HAVE HURT THEMSELVES, SOME DROPS, SOME MISSED FIELD GOALS, THE HOLDING CALL. LOSING ECKLER. THEY STARTED IN TRICK TERRITORY AND A LOT HAS GONE AGAINST THEM AND SOME OF THEIR OWN DOING. AL: THE ONE BIG PLAY, 25 YARD RECEPTION BY BROWN. BARKELY THROUGH THE MIDDLE AND NOTHING HAPPENING FOR SAQUON. OF COURSE THE GIANT FANS ARE OUT OF THEIR MINDS, THE FACT THAT BARKELY WAS LET GO. SO MUCH OF IT WAS PLAYED OUT ON THE HARD KNOCKS SHOW. BEHIND THE SCENE. KIRK: WATCHING THAT AND I THINK IF YOU KNOW SAQUON BARKLEY, HE SEEMED TO HAVE IT STARTED RIGHT THERE, A CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER. I THINK HE CAME TO PHILADELPHIA, FELT LOVED, FELT THEY BELIEVED IN HIM AND IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE NEWFOUND CONFIDENCE THAT MAYBE HAS BEEN MISSING THE LEFT COUPLE OF YEARS. AL: THIRD AND 4. THROWING, INCOMPLETE, RUSHER PUT UP. -- PRESSURE PUT UP. KIRK: IF YOU ARE A PHILLY FAN YOU ARE THINKING THIS WILL BE A COMPLETION. NOT ONLY IS A GIBRAN YOU BUT DEFENDER FAULTS. THAT'S A SAFETY, JEREMY CHINN, IF HE FELT ON HE CAN STAY WITH AG BROWN. RIGHT NOW THERE IS RHYTHM TO THE OFFENSE. JALEN HURTS IS A STREAKY QUARTERBACK, HE CAN GO AND CATCH FIRE BUT THEY ARE SEARCHING FOR THE RHYTHM. AL: NOT CAUGHT, A TWO YARD RUN. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK WITH HERTZ. -- JALEN HURTS. THE NUMBER ONE SPOT ON THE HOLIDAY CHARTS THIS WEEK. AL: IF HE SHOWS UP CAROLING IN YOUR FRONT YARD, ARE YOU GOING TO CALL -- BACK TO THE 31 YARD LINE. IT IS COMING, I PROMISE YOU. HE MAY BE IN THE BACK OF SOME -- HE'S SWEET RIGHT NOW. SECOND DOWN AND 6. ROBINSON IS THE BACK. WORKING HIS WAY TO TACKLES. FIRST DOWN UP TO THE 30 YARD LINE. KIRK: THERE'S A LOT OF PRE-SLAP AND MOTION THAT AFFECTS THE EYES OF THE LINEBACKERS AND CREATES A LITTLE HESITATION. WHEN YOU MIX IN THE POWER INSIDE RUN WITH ROBINSON BACK HEALTHY, IT'S A LOT FOR THESE BACKERS TO DEAL WITH. AL: ROLLING, THROWING, CAUGHT, OPEN ROBINSON. FIGHTS HIS WAY THROUGH. TACKLED IN BOUNDS BY COOPER. KIRK: HE STOOD A GOOD JOB OF TAKING RECEIVERS AWAY IN THE FIRST HALF. MOST OF THE PASSES HAVE BEEN AGAINST THE LINEBACKERS IN COVERAGE. IN TIME WE' IN TIME WE'VE SEEN EVERETT IN THE BACKFIELD AND THIS TIME ROBINSON, THERE IS KELCE. AL: TRYING OUT FOR FLEETWOOD MAC I GUESS WITH STEVIE NICKS. KIRK: WHAT CAN'T HE DO? AL: SECOND AND 1, ECKLER TO THE OUTSIDE AND TURNS HER BACK, TAKES IT TO THE 50 YARD LINE. AGAINST -- WINNING AGAINST KIRK: ANYTIME YOU RUN OUTSIDE THERE'S USUALLY A HOLD ON THE EDGE. >> HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER TWO. AL: THAT IS BROWN ON THE OUTSIDE. KIRK: A LOT OF THESE CORNERBACKS HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF GETTING THEMSELVES READY, JAELON DANIELS TELLING US HE IS THE BEST BASKETBALL PLAYER ON THE TEAM, HE'S DONE THIS SINCE HIGH SCHOOL. I'M SURE ONE OF HIS COACHES OVER THE YEARS TOLD HIM ABOUT THIS, HE SAYS HE DOES A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT MOVEMENTS AND THINGS. BY THE TIME HE'S DONE WITH MAYBE A 10 OR 15 MINUTE WORKOUT WITH THE BASKETBALL, HE SAID THE FOOTBALL FEELS LIKE IT IS PEEWEE BALL IN HIS HANDS. AL: THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE HIM IN THE SIXERS. SECOND AND 10 FROM THE 38 YARD IN THE POCKET. THROWS TO THE OUTSIDE. ECKLER. INSIDE AND OUT HE GOES, THIRD DOWN AND 5. KIRK: A BIG QUESTION THIS YEAR IS HOW GOOD WITH THE SECONDARY BE FOR PHILADELPHIA? THEY GOT THE TWO ROOKIES, MITCHELL FROM TOLEDO IN RIGHT CORNER, AND COOPER TO JANE, IN THE NICKEL SPOT. WENT FROM BEING A QUESTION MARK TO SOLIDIFYING HIM ON THE BACK AND. THROWS AND THE OLD EAGLE HIMSELF, ZACH ERTZ, EIGHT YEARS HERE AND WENT TO ARIZONA FOR A COUPLE SEASONS. NOW IN HIS 12TH YEAR, A BIG HERO IN THIS TOWN. KIRK: I KNOW HE'S FIRED UP TO BE BACK, LOOK AT THE SOFT COVERAGE. A BIG TIGHT END AGAINST THE ROOKIE MITCHELL, ON 30 SHORT, GIVING HIM A LOT OF ROOM OFF THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. GOOD RECOGNITION BY DANIELS WITH A PRE-SNAP FIELD. ONE OF HIS FAVORITE TARGETS, ABLE TO GET IT TO HIM ON THE PERIMETER. AL: FIVE MINUTES LEFT IN THE HALF. ROLLING LEFT. DANIELS CHOOSING TO KEEP IT. MAKING SURE HE DOESN'T GO ANY FURTHER. SECOND DOWN. KIRK: AFTER THE LOSS TO PITTSBURGH, HE TEXTED JAYDEN DANIELS, WE WILL GET THIS THING GOING, AND THEY'VE BEEN PROTECTING HIM FROM RUNNING THE COACH, YOU NEED LET ME GO, IT'S BEEN FOUR WEEKS, LET ME START RUNNING THE BALL AND HE LIKES THAT RESPONSE. AL: THAT WAS NOT CAUGHT. PAST A LITTLE LOW, NOAH BROWN. FOREVER REMEMBERED BY COMMANDERS FANS FOR MAKING THE CATCH IN THE MIRACLE PLAY AGAINST CHICAGO A COUPLE WEEKS BACK. KIRK: HE HAS A, GREAT JOB, STILL ON THE OUTSIDE, WORKS ACROSS THE FIELD, GREAT SEPARATION, TO THE AL: GOOD BOUNCE PASS, THIRD AND NINE. THE LEADING RECEIVER. DROP BY ECKLER. HE'S NORMALLY SUREHANDED AND HE DROPS THAT ONE FOR THE 9. KIRK: SECOND ARTS DOES A GOOD JOB OF GETTING -- ZACH ERTZ DOES A GOOD JOB OF GETTING IN THE DEFENDER. WITH THAT LITTLE RUB BY ERTZ, THERE'S ENOUGH RAIN TO CATCH THE FOOTBALL AND RUN TO THE CORNER TO PICK UP A FIRST DOWN. AL: THIS IS THE SEVENTH PUNT OF THE HALF. MADE A FAIR CATCH AT THE 10 YARD KIRK: YOU DIDN'T SEE THE SPIN, THE BLIND HURDLE. AL: HIS BODY JUST TOOK OVER. FROM THE 10 YARD LINE, THE EAGLES TRYING TO GET SOMETHING GOING. STARTING WITH A PASS TO THE OUTSIDE, TRYING TO PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN IS BARKLEY. KAYLEE: I THINK WE ALL GOOD -- GOT A GOOD LAUGH OUT OF IT WHEN NICK SIRIANNI TOLD US HIS KID WAS WATCHING THE GAME AND SAYING WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT. BUT HIS BROTHER, A FOOTBALL COACH, HAD TO TELL THE KIDS, YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO WHAT SAQUON DID, DON'T TRY THAT. AL: DON'T TRY THAT UNLESS YOU CAN TRY OUT FOR THE GYMNASTICS TEAM AT THE OLYMPICS. BARKLEY, PICKS UP THE FIRST CLOCKS ROLLING. >> Kirk: A LOT OF TIMES WHEN FANS ARE AT HOME WATCHING, WATCHING THE BALL, WATCHING THE IF YOU'RE A FAN OF DEFENSE AND ESPECIALLY INSTINCTS AND WISDOM, JUST WATCH 54 PRE-SNAP, AND HOW MUCH HE'S COMMUNICATE COMMUNICATING AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S SEEING WHAT HE'S SEEING IT. >> Al: DONE IT FOR 13 YEARS. AND THAT PASS IS CONTESTED, BUT BROWN IS ABLE TO MAKE THE CATCH. FORWARD PROGRESS. A FIRST DOWN. IT IS. >> Kirk: GOOD JOB BY BARKLEY. THIS TIME EHE HAD TO TAKE ON A BLOCK. YOU SAW HURTS GET HIT. IT'S BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE FROM LUVU BARKLEY HAS TO DO HIS BEST TO TAKE ON. HE DID HIS JOB BECAUSE HURTS HAD JUST ENOUGH TIME AS YOU SAID, AL, TO THROW IT AND MAKE THE CATCH. >> Al: JUST ENOUGH YARDAGE TO PICK UP THE FIRST. SMITH TACKLED BY JEREMY CHINN. SHORT GAIN. 2nd DOWN AND 7 AFTER THIS THREE. >> Kirk: NOT DOMINATING THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. IF IT COMES A GAME MAYBE YOU HAVE TO THROW MORE, TRY TO SOFTEN UP THE COVERAGE AND TRY TO SOFTEN UP THE DEFENSIVE FRONT, MAYBE YOU THROW TONIGHT AGAINST THIS COMMANDERS DEFENSE THAT'S SETUP TO RUN. SEARCHING FOR RHYTHM. >> Al: BROWN. TO BARKLEY, BREAKING TACKLES TO THE 49 YARD LINE. >> Kirk: LOOK AT HIS SUPER POWER, THAT SPIN MOVE. TOUGH ON THE DEFENSE. >> Al: 2 MINUTE WARNING. 7-0, COMMANDERS.L TRYING TO REPAIR THE CRACK IN THE LIBERTY BALL, BUT WHAT CAN I TELL YOU? >> Kirk: LOOK AT SHERM. WHY? >> Al: FIRST DOWN. HERE'S BARKLEY. TO THE 48 YARD LINE. SO A HEAVY DOSE OF HIM. 13 FOR 53. BY THE WAY, THAT WAS THE LIBERTY BELL NOT THE LIBERTY BALL. ALL OF THEIR TIMEOUTS REMAIN FOR BOTH TEAMS. AT THE 48 YARD LINE. FIRED OVER THE MIDDLE. IT'S CAUGHT BY DAVANTE SMITH. AND HE WORKS HIS WAY DOWN THE 25 CAUGHT. >> Kirk: A LITTLE SHAKE AND OFF. HE DOES SUCH A NICE JOB. GREAT ROUTE RUNNER, BUT EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH WHEN YOU LOOK AT HIS BUILD. >> Al: 21 YARD GAIN. CLOCK KEEPS ON MOVING. UNDER A MINUTE NOW. FLAG DOWN AT THE 24 YARD LINE. ADRIAN HILL GOING TO MAKE THE CALL HERE. A LITTLE ACTION GOING ON THE SIDE WITH THE TEAMS. NOTHING MAJOR. >> Referee: ILLEGAL CONTACT DEFENSE NUMBER 0. 5 YARD PENALTY WILL BE ADDED AS A RESULT OF THE PLAY, AUTOMATIC >> Al: AND THAT WILL MOVE THE BALL TO 58 SECONDS. TRYING TO SPOT IT RIGHT NOW. THEY PUT IT AT THE 20. SO A FIRST DOWN AT THE 20 YARD DOTSON IN MOTION. SAQUON PICKS UP TWO. AND FINALLY A TIMEOUT IS TAKEN WITH 51 SECONDS. TAKEN BY WASHINGTON TO CONSERVE A LITTLE TIME. >> Kirk: THEY DEFER TO OPEN THIS GAME UP SO THEY DO GET THE BALL TO START THE SECOND HALF. >> Al: SO BALL AT THE 18 YARD SO THIS DRIVE NOW STARTED AT THEIR OWN 10. BY FAR THEIR BEST DRIVE OF THE 72 YARDS, 9 PLAYS. ELLIOTT HOPING THAT HE COMES IN FOR AN EXTRA POINT AND NOT A FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT. >> Kirk: AND REMEMBER WITH JALEN HURTS, YOU SAW IT LAST WEEK AGAINST DALLAS. THREE RED ZONE INTERCEPTIONS THIS SEASON. THAT'S TIED FOR THE MOST WITH DANIEL JONES AND SAM DARNOLD, SO DON'T WANT TO FEEL THAT HE HAS TO MAKE A PLAY AND FORCE A THROW DOWN IN THIS AREA. >> Al: BROWN TO THE OUTSIDE. BROWN COMES IN MOTION TO THE INSIDE. HURTS WILL GO TO THE END ZONE, AND IT'S BROKEN UP IN THE END ZONE. AGAIN THAT'S SAINRISTIL CALLED FOR THE PENALTY ON THE LAST >> Kirk: HE PLAYED RECEIVER IN MICHIGAN. I THINK HE HAD SOME INSTINCTS. HERE HE IS AGAINST DVONTAYE SMITH, A LITTLE STUTTER AND GO, IN POSITION THERE. WHAT I LOVE ABOUT HIM AS A YOUNG CORNER HE'S ABLE TO LOCATE THE FOOTBALL AND PLAY ON THE BALL AND KNOCK IT AWAY. >> Al: ROOKIE PICKED IN THE SECOND ROUND. 3rd DOWN AND 8. FOUR-MAN RUSH. ERTZ SIGNALING, SAYING BLOCK ME. GET THE FIRST DOWN. GAINWELL LED THE WAY. >> Kirk: THIS IS THE DANGER BY ARMSTRONG. WHEN YOU GET UPFIELD, A LITTLE SPIN MOVE TAKES HIM OUT. AND NOW LOOK AT ALL THAT SPACE. AND THAT'S YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO AND CAN'T AFFORD TO DO BECAUSE THE ACCELERATION AND THE POWER THAT HE RUNS WITH, WHEN HE GETS GOING, HE COVERS A LOT OF GROUND. HE'S ABLE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE HE NEEDS TO GO TO PICK UP THAT THAT'S A CRITICAL SCRAMBLE FOR A FIRST DOWN THERE BY JALEN HURTS. >> Al: 3rd DOWN AND 8. 1st AND GOAL FROM THE 9. JALEN GOING TO KEEP IT HIMSELF. BREAKING TACKLES. AND THEY TAKE A TIMEOUT. SO FROM THE 4 IT'LL BE A 2nd AND GOAL AS THEY HAVE NOW MARCHED 86 YARDS IN 12 PLAYS. 42 RUSHING FIRST DOWNS. >> Kirk: AS DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, HIS LEGS GIVE YOU THAT EXTRA THOUGHT TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT YOU PLAYING CERTAIN COVERAGES BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO RESPECT THAT -- THAT EXTRA GAP ESPECIALLY DOWN IN THIS AREA. SO IT OPENS UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIM IN THIS PASSING GAME. WE'LL SEE WHAT THEY END UP DOING HERE TO PUNCH IT IN. >> Al: COULD BE A SHOOTOUT. EVEN THE BALTIMORE, CINCINNATI GAME LAST WEEK. >> Kirk: START SLOW. >> Al: AND THE SECOND HALF WAS CRAZY. ONE OF THE BEST GAMES OF THE SEASON. ANYWAY, PLAY RESUMES HERE AFTER THE TIMEOUT. 2nd DOWN AND GOAL. 33 SECONDS. PHILLY STILL HAS A COUPLE OF TIMEOUTS IF NECESSARY. BARKLEY, STOOD UP AT THE 3 YARD PUSHED BACK. 3rd DOWN AND GOAL. TIMEOUT. >> Kirk: DEFENSIVE LINE DOING THEIR JOB THERE EATING UP ALL THOSE BLOCKS, FREED UP THE BACKERS AND THE SAFETIES. ABLE TO CLEAN THAT UP, PREVENT HIM FROM GETTING INTO THE END THEY SLANTED, TRYING TO OCCUPY SPACE, EAT THOSE LINEMEN UP, TRY TO KEEP MARTIN FREE. IGBINOGHENE ABLE TO GET INVOLVED AND McNICHOLS, CONTACT THERE. AND A PASS AND THE THREAT AS WE SEE IN THE END ZONE. JALEN HURTS TAKING IT AND PULLING IT DOWN AND TRYING TO GET IT INTO THE END ZONE HIMSELF. GOEDERT WITH HIS SIZE AT 6'5". >> Al: THINK HE ROLLS OUT HERE? >> Kirk: I WOULD KEEP HIM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD WHERE YOU CAN ALLOW HIM TO STEP UP. >> Al: SURVEYING, LOOKING. HE FLIPS IT AWAY. GOING TO CALL IT AN INCOMPLETE PASS AND 4th AND GOAL. QUAN MARTIN PUT THE PRESSURE ON AND YOU'VE GOT 4th DOWN AND GOAL NOW. CROWD SENSING THE FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT AND NOT HAPPY RIGHT NOW. >> Kirk: YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE OF RECEIVERS THAT END UP JUST COMING THREE. MOST NOTABLY DAVANTE SMITH LOOK AT THE TRAFFIC. THEY RAN INTO EACH OTHER. EVENTUALLY YOU SEE OUT TO THE LEFT, HE'S GOT TWO GUYS ALL BY HIMSELF, BUT HE'S FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE. THEY MISS A FACE MASK CALL LOOKS LIKE HE GATE AHOLD OF THAT, BUT NO CALL. YEAH, IF HE WOULD HAVE HAD TIME TO LOOK OUT THERE EVEN AFTER HE RAN INTO HIS OWN MAN, DVONTAYE SMITH STILL WORKED OUT TO THAT FLAG. >> Al: IF HE MISSES THIS ONE, YOU'LL HEAR A SERENADE LIKE NO OTHER, BUT HE DOESN'T. HE BANGS IT THROUGH. 21 YARD ATTEMPT TO CAPJUST A GRE >> Al: ONE OF THE BEST. AND THE KICK OFF. AND SAILS THAT ONE TO THE END SECONDS AT THE 30 YARD LINE. AND THEN WASHINGTON SINCE THEY WON THE TOSS AND DEFERRED, THEY WILL GET THE BALL WHEN WE START THE THIRD QUARTER. THEY HAVE A COUPLE OF TIMEOUTS. MAYBE YOU WANT TO LAUNCH SOMETHING HERE AND TRY TO GET IN FIELD GOAL RANGE. AT LEAST THEY LINE UP IN A FORMATION TO INDICATE THEY MAY DO THAT, GO FOUR-WIDE HERE. >> Kirk: DOESN'T HAVE A TARGET YET TONIGHT. >> Al: ZERO. THROW IT OVER THE MIDDLE. EKELER IS GOING TO GET IT TO THE 49 YARD LINE. >> Kirk: THEY CAN TAKE A >> Al: THEY STILL HAVE ONE AVAILABLE. 11 SECONDS. WELL, LAST TIME THEY WERE AROUND, MISSED A SPOT AT THE END OF IT GAME. YOU CAN'T FORGET IT AND NEITHER CAN CHICAGO. ALMOST INCREDIBLE PLAYS EVER. THERE WAS NOAH BROWN. >> Kirk: SAYS THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BEARS, EVERYBODY JUDGING UP THERE AT ONCE. I THINK IN THIS CASE YOU GOT THE TIMEOUT, YOU TRY TO GET IN FIELD GOAL RANGE. I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO -- >> Al: POSSIBLE. >> Kirk: YEAH, I THINK YOU GOT PLENTY OF TIME HERE. >> TO THE OUTSIDE, LUKE McCAFFREY. 2nd AND 10. NOW YOU'VE GOT GONZALEZ, WHO'S THE KICKER THEY PICKED UP LAST WEEK OR BROUGHT HIM TO THE ACTIVE ROSTER. ANYWAY, SEIBERT HAS BEEN HAVING A FANTASTIC YEAR. HE WAS LEADING THE LEAGUE IN POINTS UNTIL A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND GOT A HIP INJURY THAT'S SHELVED HIM FOR AT LEAST TWO GAMES. SEE IF DANIELS CAN GET THEM INTO THAT RANGE RIGHT NOW. WE'VE GOT A TIMEOUT. >> Kirk: YEAH, PHILADELPHIA'S LOOKED AT THE FORMATION GROUPING, THEY GET THEIR OH, I THOUGHT WE'D COME IN TONIGHT AND SEE TERRY McLAURIN INVOLVED. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN TO SEE HOW THOSE TWO GO AT IT. MITCHELL'S HAD SUCH A GREAT START TO HIS CAREER, BUT JUST NOTHING SO FAR. >> Al: IT'S REALLY INTERESTING, TOO. COMPLETED EIGHT PASSES SINCE DANIELS, AND ONLY ONE THREW A WHITE OUT, DYAMI BROWN FOR 5 JUST FIRED, AND AT THE 40 YARD THE EAGLES SAY NO. THE OFFICIALS SAY YOU'RE RIGHT. A TIMEOUT IS TAKEN. >> Kirk: I'M WITH YOU. THEY MAY TAKE A PEEK AT THIS AND SEE IF THE BALL HITS THE SURFACE. YEAH, THAT'S INCOMPLETE. >> Al: RIGHT. AND FOR THE MOMENT, THEY LET IT GO ON THE 40 AND NOW THEY LOOK AT IT UPSTAIRS. THERE'S NO COACHES CHALLENGES IN THE LAST TWO MINUTES, AND THEY'LL MOVE THAT BABY BACK. THE CLOCK SHOWS 4 SECONDS. THE CROWD SENSING IT. >> Kirk: SO NOW YOU'LL GET TO SEE THAT HAIL MARY MORE THAN LIKELY. >> Al: MAYBE, YEP. I DON'T THINK ANY OF THE SECONDARY GUYS ARE GOING TO BAIT THE CROWD, EITHER. >> Kirk: TALKING TO THE CROWD. AND THEN BE THE PERSON WHO TOUCHES THE FOOTBALL. >> Referee: AFTER REVIEW IT WAS DETERMINED IT WAS AN INCOMPLETE PASS. WASHINGTON WILL NOT BE CHARGED WITH A TIMEOUT BECAUSE THIS REVERSAL RESULTS IN A STOPPED CLOCK. WASHINGTON HAS ONE TIMEOUT REMAINING. >> Al: OKAY. AND 4 SECONDS ON THE CLOCK. >> Referee: PLEASE RESET THE GAME CLOCK TO 5 SECONDS. >> Al: KAYLEE, RAPIDLY WHAT DO YOU HAVE? >> GUYS, JALEN HURTS IS IN THE TENT RIGHT NOW WITH THE SPECIALIST. >> Al: ALL RIGHT, OBVIOUSLY KEEPING AN EYE ON THAT. MEANWHILE, EAGLES SEND THREE GUYS BACK INSIDE THE 10 YARD >> Kirk: NOBODY'S WAVING TO THE CROWD. >> Al: NOT YET. AND THEY'RE JUST GOING TO RUN THE BALL HERE AND HALFWAY AND THE ROBINSON 4-YARD PICKUP. SO THAT IS THE END OF THE FIRST HALF IN PHILADELPHIA. AND THE BATTLE FOR FIRST PLACE IN THE NFC EAST WITH THE COMMANDERS LEADING THE EAGLES 7-3. AND WE'RE WAITING FOR KAYLEE. AND HERE SHE IS. >> WELL, DAN, IT'S BEEN A QUIET NIGHT FOR TERRY McLAURIN AND YOUR RECEIVERS. WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO TO GET THEM INVOLVED? >> GET THE BALL IN THE SECOND THAT'S GOING TO BE A BIG DEAL, GETTING OUR PLAY MAKERS NFC EAST, TOUGH DIVISION MATCHUP LIKE YOU THINK. THAT'S CERTAINLY A >> Kirk: SHORT, UNDERNEATH THROWS. ANYTHING BEYOND 10 YARDS, NEITHER GUY HAVING MUCH SUCCESS AT ALL IN THAT FIRST HALF. >> Al: AND THEY RETAIN POSSESSION. AGAIN, IT WAS EKELER WHO DROPPED THE PASS. >> Kirk: AND 32 HAS BEEN ABLE TO PICK THIS UP IN WASHINGTON. THAT'S BEEN A REAL AREA OF STRENGTH WITH TURNOVER MARGIN AND PLUS 6. LAST YEAR THEY WERE DEAD LAST IN TURNOVER MARGIN. A BIG PART OF THEIR SUCCESS THEY'VE ENJOYED THIS YEAR IS NOT TURNING THAT FOOTBALL OVER. >> Al: NO TURNOVERS FROM EITHER TEAM FIRST SCRIMMAGE TONIGHT WILL BE A RUN. BLANKENSHIP. KAYLEE WITH SIRIANNI MOMENTS AGO. >> NICK, I WAS JUST TOLD THAT JALEN HURTS WAS EVALUATED FOR A CONCUSSION BUT CLEARED TO RETURN. WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE, THOUGH, FOR YOUR OFFENSE TO GET INTO THE END ZONE? >> WE'VE BEEN DRIVING AND MISSED A COUPLE FIELD GOALS. WE SHOT OURSELVES IN THE FOOT A COUPLE OF TIMES. WE'LL GET IT GOING. >> YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE THE COMMANDERS OFFENSE OUT OF THE >> WE CONTINUE WITH THE PRESSURE UP FRONT, AND I THINK THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB IN THE SECONDARY GETTING AFTER THEM. >> MEANWHILE, THAT LINE DOES A GREAT HERE. STOPPING ROBINSON IN HIS TRACKS AND TURNING HIS 2nd AND 2 INTO A 3rd AND 5. >> Kirk: THAT IS A TOUGH THING TO DO. WYLIE GETS OFF THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE A LITTLE BIT SLOW. AND THE GET OFF BY CARTER ALONG POWER IS WHAT SEPARATES HIM, AND A TOUGH ASK OF THAT RIGHT TACKLE AND NOT UP TO THE TASK THERE. >> Al: HE MISSED LAST WEEK'S GAME WITH A SHOULDER INJURY. BLITZING, PASS IS BROKEN UP AT THE 50 BUT A FLAG IS THROWN. BROWN THE INTENDED RECEIVER. AND COOPER DeJEAN THE ROOKIE. >> Kirk: I THINK THEY GET HIM FOR A PULL-ON THE JERSEY, ASE'S CUTTING OUT ON HIS ROUTE. >> Referee: PASS INTERFERENCE DEFENSE >> Kirk: THE ONLY THING I CAN SEE IS THAT HE PULLED -- WATCH AS NOAH BROWN SETS HIM UP ON THE ROUTE, AND NEAR THE TOP OF THE ROUTE HE PULLS AWAY AND THEN THAT RIGHT HAND JUST GRABS ON, TOUGH TO SEE DIDN'T REALLY SLOW HIM DOWN AT ALL. >> Al: WE'VE SEEN WORSE, HAVEN'T WE? >> Kirk: OH, YEAH. >> Al: AND EVEN TERRY FROM HIS VANTAGE POINT GOING AH. AT THE 50 YARD LINE. ROBINSON AND EKELER BOTH IN THE BACKFIELD. AND ROBINSON WILL GO FOR A GAIN OF 2 IN EAGLES TERRITORY. >> Kirk: I THINK THIS IS -- I'D LOVE TO HEAR TERRY AND WHAT HE HAS TO SAY. THIS IS WHAT HE WORKS OUT. I THOUGHT HE GRABBED ONTO THE JERSEY. NOT THERE BUT THERE. AND HE DIDN'T SLOW HIM I GUESS THE VIEW FROM OFFICIAL YOU SEE THAT HE'S GRABBING. >> YOU CAN'T SIGNIFICANTLY HI I DON'T SEE >> Al: MEANWHILE EKELER TAKING IT INSIDE THE 30 YARD LINE FROM THE 28. HE'S BEEN THEIR PRIMARY RECEIVER, GAIN OF 20. TARGETED 17 TIMES, CAUGHT SIX. SIX OF THE NINE COMPLETIONS HAVE BEEN TO AUSTIN EKELER. >> Kirk: I FEEL THAT PLAY AGAINST PHILADELPHIA ALL NIGHT WITH THE TEMPO LOOK THEY'LL THROW AT YOU, JUST OUT, NOT QUITE LINED UPCOMING OFF OF THAT PENALTY, NOT REALLY IN POSITION, AND WASHINGTON ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. >> Al: ROBINSON ROOM TO ROAM. TO THE 20 HE GOES. >> Kirk: AND THAT PONY LOOK THEY'RE GOING WITH THE TWO BACKS I THINK CAUSES SOME CONFUSION AND HEZ TAGDS, WHICH HEZITATION, WHICH IS GIVING THEM A LOT OF ROOM TO PICK UP SOME MOMENTUM AND GET DOWNHILL ONE OF THOSE LINE BACKERS. >> Al: ON 2nd AND 2. EKELER IN MOTION. DANIELS WILL KEEP IT. BRANDON GRAHAM RIGHT NUMBER 55 STOPPING 3rd AND 4. >> Kirk: YOU TAKE NAKOBE DEAN WITH YOU, WITH THAT MOTION. SO YOU THINK THE NUMBER TO YOUR, YOU RUN THE QUARTERBACK COUNTER. THEY'VE BEEN RUNNING THE COUNTER WITH ROBINSON. NUMBERS ARE FAVORABLE, BUT A GOOD JOB SQUEEZING ON THE OUTSIDE BY THAT DEFENSE LED BY 55, GRAHAM. >> Al: 3rd AND 4th. DANIELS BACK PEDALS, FIRES, NOTHING. INCOMPLETE. FIRST TIME THEY EVEN LOOK McLAURIN'S WAY. SO THEIR LEADING RECEIVER HAS NOT BEEN TARGETED UNTIL NOW. >> Kirk: YEAH, THEY JUST -- THE ROUTE NEAR THE END OF IT, TERRY McLAURIN, DO I NEED TO CONTINUE. I THINK DANIELS THOUGHT HE WOULD CONTINUE BUT HE STOPPED FOR WHATEVER REASON. AND ONCE AGAIN NOT QUITE IN SYNC. >> Al: SO A 40-YARD ATTEMPT FOR ZANE GONZALEZ. A LOT OF KICKERS BEEN AROUND FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT TEAMS, CLEVELAND, ARIZONA, PERFECT LAST WEEK. NO KICK, NO PLAY. DELAY OF GAME. OPERATION. LIKE YOU SAID A NEW KICKER CAPABLE OF MAKING THE KICK, BUT THE HOLDER, THE SNAP, EVERYBODY'S JUST MAKING SURE THE NEW KICKER IS READY TO GO. THERE'S THE PLAY THE HOLDER NOT EVEN AWARE OF THAT PLAY DOWN IN 5, 4, 3, AND 2, SO PUSH HIM BACK 5 >> Al: NOW YOU'VE GOT A 45-YARD ATTEMPT. LAST WEEK FROM 41 AND 48. ZANE GONZALEZ TO TRY TO TACK ON 3. AND HE DOES. SO 4 MINUTES INTOTHIS MONTH. SPANNING THE RIVER LEADING INTO NEW JERSEY AS WE COME BACK TO THE LINC. STADIUM OPENED IN 2003. MEANWHILE, JAYDEN DANIELS HAND, SOME REPAIR WORK ON THE SIDELINE. >> Kirk: JUST SEEMED OFF A BIT TONIGHT. CAN SEE GOT A CUT THERE ON THAT RIGHT PINKIE MAYBE, THAT RIGHT HAND. >> Al: THIS KICK IS RETURNING FROM THE 5 GAINWELL TRYING TO FIND SOME ROOM. AND A NICE RUN BACK, AND THE FLAG IS DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD ALL THE WAY FOR THE RUN BACK. AND PER USUAL NORMALLY AGAINST A RECEIVING TEAM, ADRIAN HILL WILL CONFIRM THAT. >> Referee: DURING THE RETURN HOLDING AGAINST THE RETURN TEAM NUMBER 21. THAT PENALTY 10 YARDS, >> Kirk: NOW, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR NEXT GEN STATS POWERED BY AWS. FOCUS ON SAQUON BARKLEY. OUTSIDE THE TACKLE, 7 CARRIES, 37 YARDS. DOING A BETTER JOB OUTSIDE THAN HE HAS ON THE INSIDE. INSIDE THE TACKLE AN AREA PHILADELPHIA REALLY PRIDES ITSELF ON BEING ABLE TO ESTABLISH THAT INSIDE RUN GAME TO SETUP OTHER ASPECTS. YOU CAN SEE HE HAS NOT HAD A GREAT START. HE AND THAT OFFENSIVE LINE NOT OFF TO A GREAT START. DARON PAYNE AND COMPANY FROM THE COMMANDERS HOLDING THEIR OWN AGAINST THAT INTERIOR RUN GAME. >> Al: YEAH, THAT DEFENSE GAVE UP 31 POINTS PER GAME LAST YEAR, 22 THIS SEASON, AND 3 AGAINST PHILADELPHIA IN THE SO HURTS WHO PASSED CONCUSSION PROTOCOL STARTS WITH A RUN HERE, AND GETS TACKLED UP AT THE 21 YARD GAIN OF 8. TO KAYLEE WE GO. >> GOT A QUICK LOOK AT JAYDEN DANIELS HAND. IT APPEARS HE GOT A CUT AT THE BASE BETWEEN HIS PINKIE AND RING FINGER. THEY WERE APPLYING A STERILE SUPER GLUE THAT CAN QUICKLY CLOSE THAT WOUND, AND NOW HE'S ALL BUNDLED UP. >> Kirk: RIGHT NOW YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE PHILADELPHIA A LOT OF CREDIT FOR CONFUSING HIM AND THE ENTIRE COMMANDERS OFFENSE. JUST NOT ABLE TO GET ANYTHING GOING IN THEIR PASS GAME. >> Al: 2nd AND 3. AND IT'S GOING TO BE A YARD AND A HALF HERE AS BARKLEY DOES A NICE JOB TONIGHT. 15 CARRIES, 57 YARDS. >> Kirk: IT'S INCREDIBLE THE NUMBERS YOU BROUGHT UP LAST YEAR THIS DEFENSE TO WHAT THEY'RE DOING THIS YEAR. IT'S GOT TO BE ONE OF THE GREAT TURN AROUNDS IN THE ENTIRE NFL, WHAT DAN QUINN AND JOE WHITT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH HIS EVERY SINGLE STAT YOU LOOK AT HAS CHANGED. AND YOU LOOK AT THE DEFENDERS, THESE GUYS PLAYING, REALLY THE ONLY GUY PLAYING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FOOTBALL LAST YEAR AND EVERYBODY'S NEW. >> Al: YEAH, A LOT OF NEW PIECES. THEY CONVERT ON THIRD GOEDERT MAKES THE DRIVE AND CHINN TRACKS HIM DOWN. THAT GIVES EVERYONE SOMETHING TO YELL ABOUT. >> Kirk: CAME BACK LAST WEEK AFTER BEING OUT A FEW WEEKS, AND BIG PART OF THIS OFFENSE JUST KIND OF A LITTLE BIT OF A DELAY GETS LOST, CHINN I THINK WITH HIS EYES IN THE BACKFIELD. LOSES IN SPACE THERE IN THAT ZONE. LOSES THE THREAT OF GOEDERT. >> Al: FROM THE 36. STOPPED BARKLEY IN HIS TRACKS. BOBBY WAGNER. WHAT A PICK UP HE IS. WAGNER GOES BACK WITH DAN QUINN, SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A GUY WHO KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT HIS COACH WANTS AND THERE HE IS. >> Kirk: YEAH, HE'S DONE A GREAT JOB BEING ALL OVER THE FIELD. AND LIKE I SAID THE COMMUNICATION PART OF HE BREAKS THE BAR ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAYS, THE WAY HE MAKES THE GUYS COME IN, STUDY FILM, SHOWS EVERYBODY REALLY WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A PROFESSIONAL. SETS A GREAT EXAMPLE. >> Al: 2nd AND 10. TAKES IT UP TO ABOUT THE -- DID HE SAY TIGER WOODS ON THAT? >> Kirk: ALL I KNOW IS HE WAS GETTING FRUSTRATED. HE WANTED THAT SNAP TO COME UP BEFORE THE THREAT OF A DELAY OF >> Al: HEY, LET'S LISTEN TO IT HERE. >> Kirk: TIGER WHIP, TIGER WHIP? >> Al: ONE OF THE TWO. 3rd AND 6. EXTRA PRESSURE, LITTLE DUMP OFF. IT'S CAUGHT. BIG GAIN HERE. INTO THE SECONDARY GOES SAQUON BARKLEY DOWN TO THE 21 YARD A LITTLE LOLLY POP PASS, GOT AWAY. THE TURN WOULD HAVE BEEN A SHORT GAIN TO A VERY LONG ONE. 43 YARDS. >> Kirk: BLITZ THE LIEP BACKER HERE. WATCH SAQUON BARKLEY ABLE TO LEAK OUT, SOFT TOUCH, ABLE TO AVOID THE SAFETY. NOBODY THERE TO PICK UP SAQUON BARKLEY AFTER HE AVOIDS THE SAFETY QUAN MARTIN. >> Al: PASS GOES TO RIGHT SIDE. GOEDERT SLIPS UP AFTER A MINIMAL GAIN THERE BY SAINRISITIL. 2nd DOWN AND 8. >> Kirk: RIGHT THERE THAT MISSED TACKLE, HE'S GOT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT PLAY BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE IS LOCKED UP IN MANNED THEY HAVE NO IDEA THAT ANYBODY IN OPEN FIELD HAS THE FOOTBALL. >> Al: SO SOQUAN >> Al: SO SOQAQUAN NOW 61 RUSHING YARDS, 52 RECEIVING YARDS. BROWN AND SMITH BOTH TO THE LEFT. HURTS CHASED, GOING TO RUN IT. FORCED OUT OF BOUNDS. GOING TO SETUP A 3rd DOWN WITH 6:16 TO GO. 3rd AND 6 THIRD QUARTER. >> Kirk: YEAH, JUST IN FACT, YOU HEARD NICK SIRIANNI MENTION THIS WHEN HE TALKED TO KAYLEE ABOUT WE'VE GOT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES. WELL, HERE WE ARE. DOWN 7, 3rd AND 6. AGAIN, YOU DON'T WANT TO ROLL HIM OUT NECESSARILY. YOU KEEP HIM IN THAT POCKET WHERE HE HAS THE THREAT OF ALWAYS BEING ABLE TO STEP UP, BUYING TIME TO FIND TARGETS. A.J. BROWN, DALLAS BOTH THOSE GUYS GREAT THREATS IN THIS AREA. >> Al: GAINWELL STILL IN THERE. MEANWHILE THE PASS WAS THE ROOKIE COVERING WITH 5:30 TO GO IN THE THIRD, 4th DOWN AND A FIELD GOAL COMING IN AGAIN. >> Kirk: HE'S OUT THERE ON AN ISLAND AGAINST A.J. BROWN. WE SAW DAVANTE SMITH GIVE HIM THAT SAME DOUBLE MOVE, LITTLE STUTTER AND HE WAS IN GREAT POSITION EARLIER AND GREAT POSITION HERE AGAINST A.J. BROWN. >> Al: 31-YARD ATTEMPT FOR ELLIOTT. 1 FOR 3 TONIGHT. 2 FOR 4 TONIGHT NOW. TACKS ON 3. 5:30 LEFT SNYDER THAT LASTED ABOUT A QUARTER CENTURY. BOB MYERS IS THERE, WHO WAS THE MANAGER OF THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS FOR MANY YEARS, AARENTLY HAS COME BACK AS WELL. TOUCHBACK. MEANWHILE, JOSH OWENS, HE OWNS THREE DIFFERENT TEAMS. HE'S GOT THE SIXERS. THE NEW JERSEY FIRST PLACE IN THEIR DIVISION. THEY'RE HAPPY UP THERE AND OF COURSE HAPPY IN WASHINGTON AND HE'S TAKEN OVER. >> Kirk: SECOND LAST YEAR. AND THIS YEAR HE STOPPED BY TO GET READY FOR THE GAME. HERE'S AN OWNER THAT GREW UP THE FAN OF THE TEAM THAT HE NOW OWNS, AND HE IS DETERMINED AND PASSIONATE ABOUT GETTING THIS FRANCHISE HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. KAYLEE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE MOVES HE MADE FROM LAST YEAR, CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHERE THIS WILL CONTINUE TO GO. >> Al: SAW THE ARENA ACROSS THE PARKING LOT WHERE THE 76ers AND THE PHILADELPHIA FLYERS PLAY. AS ROBINSON PICKS UP A COUPLE HERE. MAKE IT 3, 2nd AND 7. >> Kirk: MAKE MOW MISTAKE. IT'S 10-6 GAME, FIVE MINUTES TO GO IN THE SECOND QUARTER. THIS IS A MASSIVE GAME FOR THE COMMANDERS. I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME THEY HAD A GAME THIS BIG AT THIS STAGE OF THE SEASON. I MEAN, THIS IS A BIG OPPORTUNITY ON THE ROAD TO PHILLY. >> Al: YEAH, BEEN A WHILE. LONG TIME SINCE THEY EVEN FINISHED UP. DANIELS NICE MOVE. HE TAKES IT TO THE 40 YARD LINE, AND THAT'LL BE A FIRST DOWN. THIS TEAM, THE LAST TIME THEY WON A PLAYOFF GAME WAS IN '05, 19 YEARS AGO, NO POST-SEASON WINS SINCE THEN. THEY HAVE 13 FORMER NFL PLAYERS ON THE COACHING STAFF RIGHT >> Kirk: VERY INTENTIONAL ABOUT THE ENERGY AND THE PEOPLE THEY PUT ON THEIR STAFF. >> Al: GAIN OF 4 HERE FOR ROBINSON. >> Kirk: KINGSBURY AND THE BACKUP QUARTERBACK, MARCUS MARIOTA AND THAT WAS INTENTIONAL. YOU LOOK AT THE REST OF THAT COACHING THEY BRING OVER BRIAN JOHNSON HERE IN PRITCHARD. I THINK EVERYONE LIKES HERE AND HOW THEY'RE BUILDING AROUND JAYDEN >> Al: SO FAR SO GOOD. 2nd AND 6. ROBINSON AGAIN. NOWHERE TO GO. BACK TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, JORDAN DAVIS ON THE TACKLE. 3:45 TO GO IN THE THIRD. >> Kirk: JALEN CARTER HAS JUST TAKEN HIS GAME TO ANOTHER LEVEL. ANYBODY WHO FOLLOWED HIM IN COLLEGE WHEN WAS AT GEORGIA REALLY KNEW IT WAS A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL HE WOULD BECOME AN ENFORCER IN THE INTERIOR. JORDAN DAVIS WAS IN THERE, BIG BODY. BUT CARTER JUST VIOLENT IN HOW HE PLAYS AGAINST THE RUN AND USING THAT CLUB AND QUICK GET OFF AGAINST THE PASS. >> Al: 3rd AND 5. LOOK OUT, THERE HE GOES, 34 YARD LINE, SMITH, ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE BULL DOGS GETS THE SACK. >> Kirk: COLEMAN LINED UP REALLY FAR TO THE OUTSIDE TO CREATE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO BEND UNDERNEATH HIM, USE HIS QUICKNESS. HE'S A LITTLE BIT UNDERSIZED AT THIS LEVEL, BUT BECAUSE HE'S SO QUICK AND SO AGGRESSIVE, HE'S ABLE TO WIN, AND THAT TIME HE GOT AROUND HIM. GREAT PLAY. >> Al: TRESS WAY WITH HIS FIFTH PUNT OF THE COOPER DEJEAN. WAITING, AND RUNS IT BACK TO THE 13HEIR BUY. THE COMMANDERS WILL GET THEIR BUY WEEK 14. 1st AND 10 FROM THE 24 DOTSON WAS THE MAN IN MOTION. THERE GOES BARKLEY SPINNING. FOR A FIRST DOWN. GETTING OUT TO THE 34 SO SAQUON TONIGHT HAS CARRIED 19 TIMES FOR 70 YARDS. THEY SPOT HIM A YARD SHY, 2nd DOWN AND 1. SMITH, DAVANTE SMITH HAS ENOUGH FOR THE CROWD SENSING THAT THE PERSONAL FOUL WAS FRANKIE LUVU, LEGAL TACKLE RIGHT THERE. >> Kirk: HE'S GOT THE NUMBERS OUT ON THE THREE AGAINST TWO, AND MAKES A GOOD DECISION JUST TO GET IT TO DVONTAYE SMITH. THAT'S WHAT THE CROWD REACTED TO. THEY THOUGHT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LATE HIT. >> Al: FIRST DOWN, 34 THREE RECEIVERS, SET TO THE RIGHT. AND ONE COMES INTO THE SLOT, THE OTHER IN MOTION TO THE LEFT. HURTS CHASED, THROWS, CAUGHT, BROWN 50-YARD TO THE 48 YARD LINE HE GOES. SO BROWN WAS ABLE TO WORK HIMSELF FREE. A MINUTE TO GO AND 17 YARD GAIN. >> Kirk: THAT'S A GREAT WORD, WORK. HE'S TO THE RIGHT AND HAS TO WORK WITH JALEN HURTS ALL THE WAY OVER. ONCE THE QUARTERBACK STARTS TO RUN, HE NEARS HIM AND EVENTUALLY THEY'RE ABLE TO HOOK UP FOR THAT FIRST DOWN. >> Al: THROWN FOR 180 THROWN TO THE OUTSIDE. SMITH LOOKS AROUND. CROWD SENSING A FACE MASK. FRANKIE LUVU WAS OFFICIALS CONFERRING WITH EACH OTHER TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT THE ISSUE IS. >> Kirk: MAYBE GOT THE HELMET OPENING HERE. >> Al: LOOKS LIKE IT. THIS IS WHY IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A LITTLE CONFERENCE. ONE GUY SEES IT ONE WAY, THE OTHER GUY SEES IT THE OTHER WAY. TERRY, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING? >> YEAH, KIRK SAID IF HE GETS THE HELMET OPENING, THAT'S JUST LIKE THE FATES MASK AND WOULD BE A 15 YARD PENALTY. >> Al: I THINK IT WAS UNDERNEATH THE HELMET. >> YEAH, THAT'S THE HELMET OPENING. THEY SHOULD HAVE LEFT THE FLAG DOWN. >> Al: BUT THEY DON'T. THERE'S YOUR REACTION. >> Kirk: CROWD AGREES WITH TERRY. >> Al: YOU THINK? WELL, THEY WIND THE CLOCK 2nd DOWN AND 7 AS THE ORDER IS READY TO EXPIRE ON THE 45 GOING TO BE 3rd DOWN. >> Kirk: SEE THAT LAST HE WAS WORKED UP. >> Al: NOT A LOT OF CLEAN POCKETS TONIGHT. I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT'S EVEN MORE THAN THREESIC THREE SACKS, THREE HURRIES. YOU'RE RIGHT, IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT MORE, DOESN'T IT? >> Kirk: AND EVERY OPPORTUNITY COUNTS. YOU'RE INTO THE FOURTH QUART, A GAME THAT'S NOT BEEN THE PRETTIEST FOR EITHER OF THESE. PHILADELPHIA DOWN IN PLUS TERRITORY. NEEDS TO CAPITALIZE ON EVERY CHANCE THEY GET. >> Al: THIS IS A 3rd AND 7. HURTS, RUN FOR IT. AND WILL DIVE. COMING UP A LITTLE BIT SHORT. BUTLER SAVED A FIRST DOWN, SO NOW YOU'VE GOT A FOURTH DOWN UPCOMING. 4th AND A YARD, YARD A AND HALF MAYBE. >> Kirk: EXTRA EFFORT AS HE EXTENDS. YEAH, HE'S RIGHT >> Al: THEY'VE BEEN CHALLENGED. >> Kirk: BACK FOOT IS ELEVATED. HIS FOOT NEVER TOUCHES. DEFINITELY FIRST DOWN. >> Al: IT IS. REPLAY ASSIST FROM UPSTAIRS. >> Kirk: TREMENDOUS EFFORT, BY THE WAY. YOU SAW THE SAFETY BUTLER CHASING HIM AND USING HIS SPEED. LOOKED LIKE HE WAS ANTICIPATING HURTS MAY TAKE OFF AND GO. LOOK AT THAT EFFORT BY BOTH THESE GUYS. THE SAFETY BUTLER TRYING TO MAKE THE PLAY, AND HURTS AT THE LAST SECOND KNOWS HE'S GOT TO EXTEND, KEEPS EXTENDS WITH THE RIGHT HAND TO GET THE FIRST. >> Al: THERE YOU HAVE IT, GOAL IN BOUNDS AND STILL ALIVE AT THAT POINT. ENOUGH FOR THE FIRST 38 NOW. GAINWELL IS IN THE BACKFIELD. ALMOST DUCKED. >> Kirk: THAT DIDN'T FLINCH THE RIGHT GUARD. REACTION WAS. >> Al: HERE'S GAINWELL. GAINWELL A 14-YARD GAIN OFF THE BACK OF LANE JOHNSON, WHO'S ONLY BEEN DOING THIS FOR 12 YEARS. >> Kirk: OLD SCHOOL TRAP HERE WITH LANE JOHNSON. THERE'S THE FLINCH THAT THEY REACTED TO, THE DEFENSE REACTED TO. IT WAS A LITTLE MOVEMENT. ONE OF YOUR 363 POUNDS, IT NEEDS TO BE MORE MOVEMENT THAN WHAT A BLOCK, THOUGH, BY THE RIGHT TACKLE. LANE JOHNSON OPENING THAT PLAY UP. >> Al: OH, GAINWELL AGAIN! TO THE 10 YARD LINE HE BACK-TO-BACK, BIG RUNS. CHINN MAKES THE STOP AND THAT'S A GAIN OF 14. >> Kirk: THEY PULL THE BIG FELLA. THEY'RE GETTING ANGLES NOW UP FRONT THESE LAST COUPLE RUN PLAYS. >> Al: THEY GO NO HUDDLE HERE. 11. THROUGH THE MIDDLE GAINWELL TO THE 5 AND MAYBE A LITTLE BEYOND >> Kirk: BEHIND BIG LANE JOHNSON. MYKAL BECTON. STARTING TO IMPOSE THEIR WILL UP FRONT. WE'VE NOT OF THAT TONIGHT. WE EXPECTED IT. WE THOUGHT THEY COULD HAVE A LOT OF ADVANTAGE. WASHINGTON HAS HELD THEIR OWN UNTIL THESE LAST FEW PLAYS. >> Al: GAINWELL THREE GOOD RUNS, AND NOW BARKLEY IS BACK IN. GAINWELL OUT. 2nd AND 3. BARKLEY INTO -- NO, TO THE 1 YARD LINE. CROWD THOUGHT HE GOT OFFICIALS SAY NO. DICKERSON LEADING THE WAY. THE LEFT GUARD PULLING. NOW YOU'RE IN A SITUATION YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING NEXT. >> Kirk: OH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. NOT ONLY IS DICKERSON PULLING AROUND BUT THE CENTER, WE USED TO SEE JASON KELCE DOING EVEN THE ELBOW IS >> Al: HERE COMES YOUR BROTHERLY SHOVE. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT'S COMING. HURTS GOING TO GET IN. AND TOUCHDOWN. THAT'S A 76-YARD DRIVE. 11 PLAYS. AND PHILLY HAS THE LEAD FOR THE WHAT'S COMING BUT YOU JUST CAN'T STOP IT. FRANKIE LUVU, WHO WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL NIGHT, YOU'LL SEE HIM JUST JUMP. HE JUMPS RIGHT THERE TRYING TO DO ANYTHING. THE PROBLEM IS HE'S UNDERNEATH ALL OF THAT AND EASILY GETS INTO THE END ZONE. GOOD PUSH ONCE AGAIN UP FRONT LED BY CAM JURGENS. >> Al: THE ONLY TEAM ABLE TO STOP HIM THIS YEAR HAS BEEN GREEN BAY, AND THEY WERE ABLE TO DO IT. STOPPED HIM TWICE. ELLIOTT TO THE POINT AFTER. AND, BOY, I'M TELLING YOU NO! EXACTLY 12 MINUTES >> Al: EAGLES WITH THE LEAD, BUT JAKE ELLIOTT, A NIGHT TO FORGET. HIS FIRST FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT WIDE LEFT. HIS SECOND FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT. >> Kirk: WIDE LEFT. >> Al: YEP. NOW YOU'VE GOT AN EXTRA POINT. HELLO AGAIN, EVERYBODY. SO THERE'S 7 POINTS THAT NEVER MADE IT TO THE SCOREBOARD. >> Kirk: MY GUY PAT McAFEE TEXTED ME SAYING WE HAVE BETTER KICKS WITH THE KICKING CONTEST. >> Al: ON GAME DAY. EKELER BACK TO THE 30. >> Kirk: WELL, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT A MATCHUP WE WERE TRYING TO SEE. THAT'S TARYN McLAURIN AGAINST MITCHELL. 17 DOESN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. IT'S BEEN A LOCK DOWN. MITCHELL HAS DONE A GOOD JOB. HE'S PRESSED HIM, MIXED UP DIFFERENT LOOKS. HE'S BEEN ON HIM QUITE A BIT. PLAYED SOME DOUBLE, PLAYED SOME MANNED. POWERED BY AWS, LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. 27.3% PRESS RATE FOR AL, AND SAYS ZERO >> Al: THROWS, THAT'S 9-YARD GAIN. THAT'S JOHN SPATES, FIRST TIME THEY'VE GAUP HIS WAY. >> Kirk: IN PITTSBURGH THEY WERE UP 10, UNABLE TO CLOSE IT OFF. HERE ON THE ROAD A WEEK LATER AGAINST PHILADELPHIA, WANT TO PLAY WITH THE BIG BOYS, YOU'VE GOT TO FINISH THESE GAMES >> Al: ROBINSON PICKS UP ENOUGH FOR A FIRST TACKLE THERE BY BRANDON GRAHAM 11:20 AND SECOND DOWN IN REGULATION. >> Kirk: REMEMBER YOU GO BACK TO '22. THIS EAGLES DEFENSE SINCE 1922, 19-5 IN ONE POSSESSION GAMES. THAT'S THE BEST IN THE NFL. THEY KNOW HOW TO WIN THESE KIND OF CLOSE >> Al: BEEN THERE, ALL. AND THE PASS IS DROPPED. AND BATES AGAIN MADE THE LAST CATCH. >> Kirk: HE'S TRYING TO WAIT UNTIL THE LAST SECOND. AND GOT THE ABILITY TO PLAY THESE UNUSUAL, OFF BALANCE CHANGING THE ARM ANGLE THROWS, BUT HE'S FALLEN BACK ON A LOT OF THROWS. AND PHILADELPHIA, THEY'VE COME UP WITH WAYS TO GET HIM DISRUPTED. HE'S GOT TO PLAY A TICK FASTER THAN HE HAS MOST OF THE NIGHT WHEN HE'S BEEN THROWING THE FOOTBALL. AND THAT IS CAUGHT IN EAGLE TERRITORY. THEY GO TO ERTZ. SO ONCE AGAIN IT'S A TIGHT END OR A BACK HE GOES TO. HE'S COMPLETED 11 TONIGHT, ONLY ONE FOR A WHITE OUT. >> Kirk: NAKOBE DEAN TO DANIELS. HE'S WAITING FOR ROBINSON TO COME OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. A LITTLE BIT LATE IN SCENE. >> Al: ROLLING, THROWING, ALONG THE SIDELINE, AND FINALLY McLAURIN TARGETED AND MAKES THE GRAB. >> Kirk: INSTEAD OF ON THE LEFT, MOVE HIM OVER TO THE RIGHT TO GO UP AGAINST ANOTHER ROOKIE, COOPER DeJEAN IN BACK-TO-BACK THROWS WHERE YOU SEE JAYDEN DANIELS THROWING THE BALL WITH AUTHORITY. BALL'S OUT FASTER, BALL'S CRISPR, GIVING HIS RECEIVERS A MUCH BETTER CHANCE TO MAKE A PLAY. >> Al: McLAURIN 48 CATCHES AND A OFF THE FACE. TO THE OUTSIDE THEY GO HERE, AND THIS TIME IT IS JOHN BATES AGAIN. THE NUMBER TWO TIGHT END HAS CAUGHT A COUPLE. >> Kirk: BATES HASN'T MADE PLAYS ALL YEAR IN THE PASS GAME. HE IS A PHYSICAL BLOCKER, AND I THINK THE LAST COUPLE OF PLAYS I THINK PHILADELPHIA'S DEFENSE, IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY'RE NOT EVEN ANTICIPATING HIM BEING INVOLVED IN THE ROUTE. BOTH TIMES HE WAS -- HE WAS OPEN AND A GOOD JOB. ONCE AGAIN DANIELS THIRD THROW IN A ROW AND THE BALL COMES OUT QUICK. >> Al: BATES CAUGHT ONLY THREE COMING INTO THE GAME ALL SEASON. ROBINSON, NO. MAN IN THE BACKFIELD THAT TIME. JALEN CARTER TAKES HIM >> Kirk: CARTER BECOMING ONE OF THE NOW IN THE NFL. SEE HOW HE USES HIS HANDS, EYES HE PLAYS IT ALMOST LIKE A LINEBACKER WITH HIS INSTINCTS AND MIX IN THE POWER AND QUICKNESS HE HAS TO GO WITH IT. REALLY IN THE SECOND YEAR START TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE INTERIOR THIS DEFENSE. >> Al: 3rd DOWN AND 1. SO THREE TIGHT ENDS ROBINSON IN THE ROBINSON, NO, SIR. SO NOW YOU'VE GOT A 4th DOWN COMING UP WITH 8:30 LEFT IN YOU'VE GOT GRAHAM THERE, YOU'VE GOT BAUN IN FACT, THEY'VE LOST A YARD. 4th AND A DEUCE. >> Kirk: SUCH RHYTHM IN THIS DRIVE UNTIL THAT PLAY. LOOKED BACK AT ROBINSON, AND JUST LOOKED LIKE IT WAS A LITTLE BIT SLOW AND DELIBERATE, AND IT GAVE PHILADELPHIA A CHANCE TO DIG THEIR CLEATS INTO THE GROUND THERE AND GET OFF THE BALL. >> Al: GONZALEZ IF THEY DON'T GET A YARD HERE, HE'S GOT ABOUT A 43-YARD ATTEMPT TO TAKE THE LEAD. OH, BOY, JUGGLED IT. LUCKY HE CAME AWAY AND THEN HE GETS SLAMMED OUT OF BOUNDS SHORT OF THE FIRST AT FIRST IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS GOING TO FUMBLE IT. BAUN HITS HIM, AND ITS AND LOOK AT THAT, >> Kirk: WELL, THE DECISION TO GO FOR IT, WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT IN A SECOND, BUT WATCH BAUN WORK OFF OF THIS, OFF TO THE EDGE. REALLY GOOD JOB THERE. THE ONE QUESTION I HAVE NOAH BROWN, BLOCKING PLAY, HE ENDS UP MAKING A TACKLE AND FELT PRESSURE FROM THE INSIDE FROM BLANKENSHIP, SO HE TRIES TO BLOCK. NOT ABLE TO MAKE THAT BLOCK, AND AL, YOU CALLED IT ON THE LIVE CALL, THE PLAY NEVER HAD A CHANCE THERE. THE BALL GETS AWAY, CARTER'S IN THE HE'S JUST TRYING TO IMPROVISE TO MAKE A THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A 45-YARD FIELD GOAL TO >> Al: AND EVEN THOUGH GONZALEZ IS THE KICKER WHO CAME IN -- HASN'T MISSED A KICK IN TWO WEEKS. AGAINST PITTSBURGH. >> Kirk: BIG POINT IN THE GAME HERE. WASHINGTON ROLLS THE DICE, CHANCE TO TAKE THE LEAD. DAN QUINN GETS AGGRESSIVE. PLAY BLOWS UP NOW. WASHINGTON RELYING ON THEIR DEFENSE TO TRY TO GIVE JAYDEN DANIELS THE BALL BACK, AND PHILLY A CHANCE TO WORK SOME CLOCK HERE. >> Al: OFF THE FAKE, AND FINALLY HAS A TON OF TIME. AND WIDE OPEN. PASS IS MADE. LOSES THE BALL. BUT THE EAGLES ARE THERE TO RECOVER IT. KNOCKED OUT BY QUAN MARTIN. AND GOEDERT TOSSED THE BALL AND GRANT THE DAY. DOES HE EVER. >> Kirk: DOES HE EVER. EFFORT THERE. FROM HIS BODY. SMART PLAY THERE TO KNOCK THAT FOOTBALL AWAY BY MARTIN. LOOKS LIKE THE COMMANDERS GOT A SHOT, BUT RIGHT WHERE HE NEEDS TO BE TO HELP HIS TEAMMATE OUT. UNDERNEATH COVERAGE TOOK ALL THE UNDERNEATH ROUTES LED BY SAQUON BARKLEY, OPENED IT UP OVER TOP. >> Al: THEY GO TO THEIR WORKHORSE AGAIN. STOPPED AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND MAYBE A FEW INCHES BEYOND. 2nd DOWN. >> Kirk: GOEDERT AND CALCTERRA GOOD BUDDIES. COMMANDERS ARE IN THAT MODE. THEY'RE TRYING TO KNOCK ANYTHING THEY CAN AWAY FROM THE EAGLES. >> Al: UNDER 6 MINUTES LEFT IN REGULATION. 2nd DOWN 9. HURTS FIRES, CONTESTED, AND CAUGHT BY BROWN. BROWN ON THE OUTSIDE SAINRISITIL MAKING THE GRAB, DOING A GOOD JOB THAT GAIN 6 YARDS AND A 3rd DOWN AND 3. >> Kirk: INTERESTING CALL HERE BECAUSE THEY GOT POSITIVE YARDS 3rd AND 3. UP BY 2, IN FIELD GOAL RANGE WITH A SHAKY KICKER. YOU WONDER WHAT KIND OF PLAY CALL YOU GO WITH HERE, JUST TO POTENTIALLY SETUP. THEY GET TO THAT AND 1, 1 NF. YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALWAYS CONFIDENT HOW THEY CAN PICK UP THAT >> Al: AND THE BALL IS ON THE GROUND, AND FIRST DOWN AND MOORE. BARKLEY TOUCHDOWN! >> Kirk: PHILADELPHIA MAKES DAN QUINN AND WASHINGTON PAY FOR THAT CHANCE THEY TOOK. WATCH THE RIGHT TACKLE WITH A GREAT KICKOUT BLOCK HERE BY LANE THE ENTIRE RIGHT SIDE HERE DOES THEIR JOB. ALSO THIS CENTER CAM JARGONS CREATING THAT. >> Al: IMPORTANT PLAY MEANWHILE, THE ICING ON THE CAKE FOR BARKLEY, HE NOW HAS 100 YARDS TONIGHT. AND THERE'S THE LASTD THAT SHOT. >> Kirk: DUDE, YOU SAVED ME. THANK YOU. >> Al: ONE TIGHT END SAVING THE BACON OF THE OTHER. TOUCH BACK HERE. WASHINGTON AT THE 30 YARD LINE NEXT. IN HIS SECOND YEAR IS CAPABLE OF TAKING GAMES OVER. WHAT THE COACHES CALL A GAME RECORD. NO MATTER WHO'S PLAYING THE EAGLES, THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK UP AND SAY WHERE'S 98? HE'S GOTTEN COMFORTABLE. HE KNOWS HIS ROLE. THEY'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HIM JUST BEING A MENACE ON THE HE'S INVOLVED IN A HE CANNOT BE BLOCKED ONE-ON-ONE. I THINK ONE OF THE TOP INTERIOR DEFENSIVE LINEMEN IN THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE RIGHT NOW. >> Al: NUMBER ONE OVERALL PICK LAST SO COMMANDERS DOWN BY 9. DANIELS FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE. AND REED BLANKENSHIP, WHO FOR THE MOMENT HAS AWARDED THE INTERCESSION. AND THEY'RE GOING TO GO CELEBRATE. OF COURSE THEY'LL TAKE A PEEK AT IT. THE SMILING SIRIANNI. AND DANIELS OF ALL THINGS ON A FIRST PLAY, DOWN BY 9 IS PICKED OFF. HERE IT IS AGAIN. >> Kirk: NICE >> Kirk: NOAH BROWN IS RIGHT HERE. AND THIS IS JAYDEN DANIELS TRYING TO MAKE I THINK HE'S STARING DOWN HIS RECEIVER THE WHOLE WAY, AND BLANKENSHIP WAITING FOR THE BALL TO BE THROWN, AND JUST STEPS IN FRONT OF THIS DEFENSE I THINK HAS GAINED CONFIDENCE THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. THEY'VE DONE A HECK OF A JOB WITH VIC FANGIO. AND REMINDING ALL OF US TONIGHT TONIGHT HE'S LOOKED LIKE A ROOKIE QUARTERBACK AGAINST A VETERAN DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR. HE WAS HAVING SOME FUN DOWN THERE. >> Al: FOR SURE. BLANKENSHIP NOW HAS THREE OF THEIR SEVEN INTERCEPTIONS THIS DANIELS ONLY T HIS THIRD. HERE'S BARKLEY ALREADY INTO TRIPLE FIGURES. WE GO TO KAYLEE. >> GUYS, THAT PICK MAKES 11 TAKE-AWAYS IN THE LAST FOUR GAMES. AND JUST BEFORE THIS SURGE BEGAN, INSIDE LINEBACKER COACH BOBBY KING SHOWED THE DEFENSE LET THE SURFERS HIT BIG WAVES. HE WAS TELLING THEM WE'VE GOT TO CATCH THE WAVES AFTER TWO TAKE-AWAYS IN THE FIRST SIX GAMES, ZACK BAUN TOLD ME NOW THEY HAVE CAUGHT THE WAVE. >> Al: I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE. SURFING MOVIES. >> Kirk: I GUESS SURFING MOVIES WIN OVER SHARK WEEK. >> Al: A LITTLE AROUND HIM, A BIT OF CONSOLATION. SAYING, MAN, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE DAYS LIKE THIS. DOWN BY 9 NOW IN THE BATTLE FOR FIRST PLACE. BARKLEY, DOES HE HAVE ANOTHER ONE? YES, HE DOES. TOUCHDOWN. 39 YARDS TO THE LAST THREE DRIVES THEY HAVE BEEN UNSTOPPABLE. AND SAQUON NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN 146 YARDS. >> Kirk: THAT'S WHY IT'S A 60-MINUTE GAME. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW SAQUON BARKLEY HAVE THAT KIND OF ENERGY? AND JUST FOR FUN THE GUY WHO REPLACED JASON KELCE HAVING A GOOD HE JUST BODY SLAMS THE SAFETY TRYING TO COME UP THERE. AND SAQUON BARKLEY GOT TO PLAY 60 MINUTES TO STOP THIS GUY. EVEN OFF TO A SLOW START, HE AND THIS OFFENSE WILL KEEP COMING AFTER YOU. >> Al: WHAT'S FUNNY, 146 YARDS AND IT'S ONLY HIS FOURTH HIGHEST YARDAGE TOTAL ON THE GROUND THIS THINK ABOUT THAT. EYES. I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM LOOK LIKE THIS IN A LONG TIME. HE'S ON A MISSION. >> Al: EXTRA POINT THIS TIME AND RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE. 4:38 TO GO HAVING ANOTHER BIG NIGHT TONIGHT. GIANTS FANS SITTING THERE SAYING YOU'RE KILLING US, YOU'RE KILLING US. STOP IT. >> Kirk: PUT HIM DOWN THERE WITH THE OFFENSIVE LINE. WHAT EVERY RUN BACK SHOULD DO. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS SOME NEW FACES UP DICKERSON WAS DOWN WITH AN INJURY. CAME RIGHT BACK THE NEXT SIRIS. JOHNSON HAVING A PRO BOWL TYPE OF YEAR. SAM JURGENS HAS DONE A WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT HIM TONIGHT, THE CENTER. NOW BACK IN PHILLY PLAYING GUARD. JURGENS BODY SLAMMED THE SAFETY, SENDING AN ATTITUDE AND BEEN A BENEFICIARY ALL YEAR TO THE WAY THOSE GUYS PLAY UP FRONT. THERE'S SAQUON BARKLEY AND ONE OF THE BEST LINE COACHES, BEEN DOING IT A LONG TIME. >> Al: AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, YEARS AGO, HOW IMPORTANT HAVE THOSE GUYS BEEN TO THEIR TEAM THROUGH THE YEARS? >> Kirk: THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU LOSE JASON KELCE, HEART AND SOUL. THEY'VE HAD TO BOB AND WEAVE. THEY'RE HEALTHY AND SHOWING WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF. GOES NOWHERE. CLOCK CONTINUES TO RUN. BAUN MAKES THE TACKLE. CLOCK RUNNING DOWN TO 4 MINUTES LEFT IN AND THE COMMANDERS ARE 1 OUT OF 9 ON THIRD DOWN TONIGHT AND OF COURSE LEADS TO A LOT OF PUNTS. 3rd AND 2. DANIELS THROWS, FLAG IS THROWN. THAT'S ONE-HANDED FOR THE MOMENT BY ERTZ, BUT THEN HE SAYS NO. CHECK OUT THE FLAG. AND THE ANSWER >> Referee: THERE'S NOW FOUL IN PLAY FOR OFFENSE PASS INTERFERENCE. >> Kirk: YEAH, THIS DEFENSE THEY ALLOWED THE ONE TOUCHDOWN EARLY IN THIS GAME. YOU ADD UP SINCE THEY'VE BEEN ON THIS RUN OF WINNING FIVE IN A ROW, NOW IT'S GOING TO BE SIX IN A ROW. 6-0 THESE LAST SIX WEEKS, ALLOWS FIVE TOUCHDOWNS TOTAL AS THE DEFENSE IN THOSE SIX WEEKS. >> Al: SO THE PASS TO ERTZ WAS GOOD FOR 4 YARDS, AND THAT'S ENOUGH FOR A FIRST SO ALL NIGHT LIKE GOES TO ZACCHEAUS THAT TIME. SO DANIELS 16 OF 25. YOU GO BACK TO THE 16 COMPLETIONS AND ANOTHER MASTERFUL PERFORMANCE. AND ONLY TWO OF THEM, ONE FOR McLAURIN FOR 10 YARDS. ONE TO DYAMI BROWN FOR 2 YARDS. THE ONLY WIDE OUT TO CAS CASS PASSES >> Kirk: THE JOB HE'S DONE ESPECIALLY THE LAST SIX WEEKS HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARY. >> Al: AND THAT PASS IS INCOMPLETE. >> Kirk: WE'VE GOT A PENALTY DOWN RIGHT ON THE BACKFIELD THERE. >> Referee: PERSONAL FOUL, ROUGHING THE PASSER, DEFENSE NUMBER 97. 15-YARD PENALTY. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. >> Al: YOU LOOK AT WASHINGTON'S SCHEDULE. 4 OF THEIR LAST 6 ARE AT HOME AND HAD A BI-WEEK, WEEK 14 AS WELL. ONE OF THEIR GAMES AGAINST PHILLY TONIGHT, TWO AGAINST DALLAS. AND YOU SEE THE FOUL RIGHT THERE. MEANWHILE, PHILLY GETS TO PLAY FOUR OF THEIR LAST FIVE IN ALL. AND LAST TWO AGAINST THE GIANTS AND THE COWBOYS. HOW'S THAT LOOKING FOR THEM? >> Kirk: YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY'S ALMOST ASSUMING DETROIT IS GOING TO BE THE ONE SEED COMING OUT OF NFC. PHILLY IS SITTING HERE 8-2 WITH 7 TO GO. THEY STILL HAVE LOT OF GAMES AHEAD OF THEM AND GAMES THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE TO CONTINUE TO WIN. LISTEN, THEY DIDN'T PLAY THEIR GREATEST TONIGHT OFFENSIVELY. THEY FOUND WAYS TO GET IT DONE LATE. OFFENSIVE LINE TOOK OVER, BUT JUST ABOUT AS BAD THEY CAN PLAY OFFENSIVELY. AND THEY WON 26-10. >> Al: WELL, 3 POINTS AT HALF TIME. YOU GO BACK A MONTH AND A HALF. REMEMBER, LAST YEAR, OF COURSE YOU HAVE THE MELT DOWN. YOU TALK ABOUT THEY WERE GOING TO BE THE NUMBER ONE SEED AND GETTING BLOWN OUT IN THE WILD CARD ROUND. COMPLETE MELT DOWN AT THE END. THAT PASS IS CAUGHT AND ERTZ ON THE YOU CAN'T ASSUME ANYTHING THESE DAYS. 10-1 FOR THAT. IT'S FUNNY A MONTH AND A HALF AGO THEY'RE READY TO MAKE SIRIANNI A PINATA, READY TO BURN THE STADIUM DOWN, RIGHT? 2-2, TERRIBLE AGAINST TAMPA BAY. >> Kirk: DON'T YOU THINK THE EXPERIENCE LAST YEAR SITTING THERE LOSING THOSE GAMES AND LIMPING INTO THE WILD CARD GAME AND GETTING EMBARRASSED BY TAMPA, THE FAN REACTION, THE CHANGES THEY MADE STARTING 2-2, I JUST THINK IT'S MADE THEM TOUGHER. I THINK IT'S MADE THEM A TEAM AND YOU CAN GET THROUGH NIGHTS LIKE THIS, BUT YOU FIND WAYS TO WIN GAMES. THAT'S WHAT GREAT TEAMS DO. >> Al: AND OF COURSE THE CHANGE IN COORDINATORS. AND THEY WANTED NICK, BUT THEY WANTED FANGIO TO COME HERE. NICK LAST YEAR COULDN'T GET HIM. ALREADY SIGNED WITH MIAMI. THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT AND HE BECAME AVAILABLE, AND THEY POUNCED ON IT. AND WILL BE A FOURTH DOWN-PLAY COMING UP McNICHOLS AGAIN. THE 2-MINUTE WARNING. >> Kirk: LAST YEAR MIAMI, I DON'T KNOW THAT WAS A FIT AS FAR AS VIC FANGIO AND THEIR DEFENSE. THEY NEVER QUITE COMPLETELY BOUGHT INTO WHAT HE WAS TEACHING. THIS IS A YOUNG EAGLES IT'S GOING TO HIM EVERY WEEK WITH GIVE US THE WISDOM, WHAT DO WE NEED TO KNOW, HOW CAN YOU HELP US? A LOT OF THEM ARE JUST SPONGES WANTING TO LISTEN TO WHAT HE CAN OFFER I THINK THEY'VE ALL BOUGHT IN AND THE RESULTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. >> Al: 2-MINUTE WARNING AND WE CAN TELL YOU THE JC PENNEY POST GAME SHOW EXCLUSIVELY ON PRIME VIDEO WITH CHARISSA AND THE FABLED GANG. WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY'RE HEADING TONIGHT? >> Kirk: I'D GO TO MY NEXT STOP AFTER THE GAME, THEY KEEP GOING. >> Al: YOU'LL BE IN ATHENS LATE INTO TONIGHT AND THEY'LL BE -- I DON'T KNOW. >> Kirk: LIBERTY BELL. >> Al: THEY WENT TO THAT LAST NIGHT. >> Kirk: YOU BROUGHT THIS UP, THE NFC EAST HAVEN'T HAD A REPEAT WINNER THE LAST 19 DALLAS WON LAST YEAR, SO IT'S GOING LONGEST STREAK NFL, WNBA, MLS, YOU NAME IT, THERE'S NEVER BEEN A LEAGUE 20 STRAIGHT YEARS WHERE YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT WINNER. GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN >> Al: BACK-TO-BACK. LAST TIME IT WAS DONE THE EAGLES DID IT WON THROUGH '04 CROWD SMELLING BLOOD. THE GAME IS OVER, BUT THEY'RE ROARING ON THE 4th AND 2. DANIELS FIRES, AND THAT WILL BE ENOUGH ZACK ERTZ AGAIN. >> Kirk: GETTING BEYOND THE FIRST DOWN MARKER. >> Al: NOAH BROWN. >> Kirk: AS YOU LOOK AT THIS FRANCHISE, THE NEXT NATURAL STEP FOR THEM IS PUT PIECES. I THINK THEY'RE STILL KIND OF SEARCHING AS THEY GROW TO BECOME DIFFERENCE MAKERS. >> Al: ON THE OUTSIDE McNICHOLS. YOU SAW KLIFF SIDELINE, HEY, LET'S GET INTO THE END ZONE, LET'S LEAVE WITH SOMETHING, WITH ANYTHING. DANIELS ESCAPES. THAT PASS I HAULED IN AT THE 6 YARD LINE. THAT'S ZACCHEAUS, MAKING IT THE 1st AND GOAL. WELL, 36 TOTAL POINTS. I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING'S IN PLAY HERE, BUT IT'S NOT. >> Kirk: I APPRECIATE AND THAT'S BROKEN UP AND INCOMPLETE. >> Kirk: GARDNER JOHNSON GOT A GREAT JUMP ON THAT, ALMOST CAME UP WITH AN INTERCEPTION. LIKE YOU SAID, THIS GAME IS OUT OF REACH, BUT BOTH SIDES ARE COMPETING. C.J. GARDNER-JOHNSON AGAIN READING THE ALMOST GETS IN FRONT. THAT'S A BATTLE TO FOUR HANDS -- TWO SETS OF HANDS FIGHTING FOR THAT FOOTBALL. >> Al: THESE TWO TEAMS WILL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN BEFORE THE END OF THE SEASON IN LANDOVER. RESET THE PLAY CLOCK SAYS ADRIAN HILL. ON A 2nd DOWN AND SO WASHINGTON WILL GO TO 7-4, AND THE EAGLES ARE GOING TO GO TO AND THAT WILL BE CAUGHT FOR A SO ZACK ERTZ, WHO WILL ALWAYS BE WRITTEN INTO THE LORE OF THE EAGLE, THE BIG TOUCHDOWN IN THE SUPER BOWL AGAINST NEW ENGLAND. QUINN SAYS LET'S GO FOR A PAIR. >> Kirk: YOU GET AN ONSIDEKICK. YOU NEVER KNOW. >> Al: YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT JAYDEN DANIELS DID AGAINST CHICAGO. >> Kirk: STILL HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS >> Al: JUST SAYING. AND A TIMEOUT IS NOW CALLED BY SIRIANNI. YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE THIS UP. MOVE AROUND AND DON'T RECOVER AN ON-SIDE KICK AND HAVE DANIELS DO HIS THING AGAIN. >> Kirk: LEAGUE WIDE THIS YEAR THE ON-SIDE KICK HAS WORKED TWICE, 2 OF 30. AGAIN, THERE'S ALWAYS A CAHANCE. GOT TO HIT THIS 2-POINTER FIRST. 7% CHANCE. >> Al: I'M SAYING 4.36 EXPECTED, NEXT GEN. I'M THE LAST GEN. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY? HERE'S A 2 POINT RIGHT DANIELS ROLLING, TRYING TO GET RID OF IT, LOOKING DOWNFIELD. CAN SOMEBODY GET OPEN? NO, THAT OPEN BUT >> Kirk: NO, IT'S 0.00 CHANCE. >> Al: 0.01 AGAINST EXPECTED. >> Kirk: NOBODY WAS ABLE TO WORK WITH THE GOOD EFFORT THERE BY ERTZ. THAT'S WORTH ANOTHER LOOK DOES HE HAVE POSSESSION OF THE >> Al: THERE'S COOPER DeJEAN. >> Kirk: HE DEFINITELY HAD THIS BALL. WANT TO SEE HIS FEET. >> Al: OKAY, >> Kirk: WOW. WOW. IF THAT RIGHT FOOT -- THE LEFT FOOT'S DOWN. IS THAT RIGHT FOOT DOWN TO GET THAT BALL? >> Al: TERRY, WHAT YOU SEEING? >> YEAH, AL, IT LOOKS LIKE THAT RIGHT TOE JUST TOUCHES THE GROUND BEFORE I THINK THIS IS GOOD. >> Al: WELL, NOT YET. ADRIAN HILL JUST ANNOUNCING THIS IS UNDER REVIEW. >> Kirk: BEYOND THAT, LOOK AT THIS GUY. LOOK AT THE EFFORT. 34-YEAR-OLD GUY, FORMER EAGLE, GIVING YOU -- I DON'T EVEN THINK HE CAN SEE THE BALL WITH DeJEAN IN HIS WAY. NOT ONLY DOES HE SEE IT, HE CATCHES IT AND WITH HIS BODY FALLING, AT LEAST GAVE HIMSELF A SHOT HERE TO GET TO THE SPEED THE FEET DOWN. >> IT SHOULD >> Al: THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT 26-18, ON-SIDE KICK TO GO. THAT'S WHEN YOU SAY DON'T TOUCH THAT DIAL. BUT STREAMING, WHAT DO YOU DO? >> Kirk: I DON'T KNOW. REALLY DON'T KNOW. >> Al: NOBODY KNOWS. NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING. SO ADRIAN HILL, LOOK AT THIS. IT'S GOING TO BE 26-18 WITH AN ON-SIDE KICK. >> Kirk: YEAH, THAT'S A CATCH. GOT THE FEET DOWN. GOT AN 8-POINT BALL GAME HERE. REVIEW IT WAS DETERMINED THE RECEIVER HAD BOTH FEET INBOUNDS. IT IS A SUCCESSFUL 2-POINT DRIVE. >> Al: DON'T LOG OFF. THAT'S GOT TO BE THE CALL, RIGHT? GOOD CALL. WELL, I KNOW WE'RE BACK TO -- >> Kirk: I THINK WE ARE BACK. HE'S GOING TO TRY TO ON-SIDE KICK IT, RECOVER IT. TIMEOUT CALLED. >> Referee: TIMEOUT PHILADELPHIA, THEIR IT'LL BE A 30-SECOND NOW, WHAT WOULD BE CRAZIER, A WIN AGAINST CHICAGO OR SOMETHING LOONY HAPPENING IN THIS GAME? I DON'T KNOW. >> Kirk: WELL, HOW ABOUT IF YOU RECOVER THE ON-SIDE KICK, THROW ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE COMMANDERS HAIL MARYS, HIT IT, AND THEN MISSED A 2-POINTER, CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT? >> Al: NO. IT'S THE NFL, ANYTHING HAPPENS. ANYTHING HAPPENS. SO, AGAIN, GONZALEZ IS THE GUY THAT IS IN THERE TEMPORARILY BEFORE SEIBERT GETS HEALTHY, AND HE CAN BECOME A MAJOR HERO RIGHT NOW. LET'S SEE WHAT HERE'S YOUR ON-SIDE KICK, YOUR BOUNCING AND THAT WAS SECURED. WITH A BIG ROLL IN THIS ONE, BIG CATCH, FUMBLE. CALCTERRA SAVED THE DAY. SO THEY'RE GOING TO PUT 27 SECONDS ON THE I MEAN, WASHINGTON STILL HAS TWO ONLY THING THAT CAN HAPPEN WOULD BE SOME CRAZY FUMBLE ON THE SNAP. ALREADY THE CONGRATULATIONS ON THE PHILLY SIDELINE. AND KNEE HERE ESSENTIALLY CALLING A TIMEOUT HERE, LET THE CLOCK RUN-DOWN. AND THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES HAVE NOW MADE IT SIX IN A ROW AFTER STARTING 2-2. WASHINGTON LOSES BACK-TO-BACK FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR. IT'S A GAME AND A HALF LEAD NOW IN THE NFC EAST. FLOWCHART TONIGHT, TREMENDOUS FINISH. WHAT A YEAR HE'S HAVING LEADING THE LEAGUE RIGHT NOW IN RUSHING AND SCRIMMAGE WHAT A PICKUP. TOGETHER. THEY BREAK INTO "FLY EAGLES FLY" HERE IN HURTS AND DANIELS GET
