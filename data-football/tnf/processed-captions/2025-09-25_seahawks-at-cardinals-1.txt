SEATTLE WON THE TOSS AND HAVE DEFERRED. FELID AT THE TWO YARD LINE. HERE COMES STORCH. TO THE 20. SPUN OUT ABOUT THE 26 YARD LINE. SO THE CARDINALS NOW, WHO HAVE BEEN TO THE PLAYOFFS JUST LAST -- JUST ONCE IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS, MURRAY WAS THE NUMBER ONE PICK IN 2018. HE WAS THE NUMBER ONE OVERALL PICK IN THE MAJOR-LEAGUE BASEBALL DRAFT BY THE THEN OAKLAND AS. THAT TELLS YOU LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE. HE STILL THINK HE COULD BE AN OUTSTANDING BASEBALL PLAYER. PRETTY OBVIOUSLY A SPECIAL TALENT ATHLETICALLY. COULD HAVE STOLEN 40 BASES A SEASON AMONG OTHER THINGS. A PASS OUT TO THE LEFT. THEY GO RIGHT TO HARRISON. NOW IT IS MARV. WHAT ABOUT HIM? ONE OF THE THINGS THEY SAID TO US, ESPECIALLY LAST WEEK, THEY SAID WE CAN PROBABLY DO A BETTER JOB GETTING HIM THE FOOTBALL EARLIER JUST TO KIND OF LET HIM SETTLE INTO THE GAME AND GET HIS CONFIDENCE ESTABLISHED. FIRST PLAY OF THE GAME, POSITIVE YARDS AGAINST A SOFT CORNER. THAT WILL BE A BIG THEME TONIGHT FOR THE CARDINALS. AL: AND WITH CONNOR OUTCOME OF THE NUMBER ONE RUNNING BACK IS TREY BENSON. THE PASS IS CAUGHT ON THE LEFT SIDE BY TREY MCBRIDE, THE TOP RECEIVER. IN A GREAT TIGHT END. YOU PLAY WITH THE CARDINALS AND SOMETIMES YOU ARE A LITTLE OVERLOOKED AND UNDERAPPRECIATED. HE FIT THE BILL. KIRK: NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. YOU CAN PUT HIM IN THE ARGUMENT WITH THE TOP TIGHT ENDS. MOST ALL TIME BY A TIGHT END. IT OFF TO AN OUTSTANDING START LEADING THE CARDINALS THIS YEAR. SOFT COVERAGE AGAIN AND AN EASY QUICK THROW FROM MURRAY. BENSON IS THE RUNNING BACK. TRIES TO BREAK THE TACKLE. STOPPED HIM. HALF A YARD BY ERNEST JONES. WHEN ERNEST JONES GETS GOING, HE IS TOUGH. SPECIAL PLAYER. WENT OVER TO TENNESSEE. THE SEAHAWKS LOVE ENOUGH TO GET HIM IN A TRADE LAST YEAR , REALLY SETTLED THEIR DEFENSE DOWN. TREMENDOUS LEADER. GREAT COMMUNICATOR. READ THAT ONE PERFECTLY. ASSISTED BY DERICK HALL, SET THE EDGE AND LET HIM CLEAN UP. SECOND AND 10. A NICE TACKLE FROM BEHIND. ALMOST GOT GOING BY DERICK HALL. STOPPED HIM THERE. THIRD DOWN AND ABOUT SEVEN. KIRK: YOU WANT TO KEEP THE EDGE AGAINST MURRAY FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. AND YOU WILL SEE HIM HAVE HIS HANDS ON THE BALL NIGHT. A HECK OF A PLAY TO RECOVER BY DERICK HALL BUT ONE THING WE KNOW FOR SURE, DREW WOULD LIKE TO DO A GOOD JOB OF GETTING THE BALL IN HIS HANDS WHETHER IT IS RUN OR THROW. THE DEFENSE HAS TO KEEP HIM INSIDE AND LET THEM CHASE HIM DOWN. A THIRD-YEAR OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. DEEP DROP. MURRAY KEEP HIS EYES ON FIELD AND THROWS IN THE PASS IS SHORT. MICHAEL WILSON, WHO WAS THERE, HOW BLIP -- HAD LEVERAGE TO THE OUTSIDE. KIRK: THAT IS ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU COULD HOPE FOR FROM MURRAY BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE. WHO COULD POTENTIALLY BECOMING ON A BLITZ AND IN THIS CASE THEY ALL DID. EYES IN THE BACKFIELD SO HES GOT SEPARATION. JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE FOOTBALL AND WILSON IS ABLE TO MAKE A CATCH BUT INSTEAD IT IS INCOMPLETE. FAIR CATCH CALLED FOR AT THE LINE. A COUPLE OF MINUTES INTO THE GAME IN ARIZONA ON THIS THURSDAY NIGHT. IN 2018 BY THE JETS, PRO BOWL NEXT YEAR. FIVE DIFFERENT TEAMS NOW IN EIGHT SEASONS. WILL THIS BE A LONG TIME HOME FOR HIM? WE START FROM THE 14 YARD LINE. WALKER TO THE OUTSIDE. STUCK TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. SECOND AND 1. MACK WILSON ON A LOT OF PLAYS TONIGHT. KIRK: HE FOUND A HOME IN PHOENIX WITH THIS DEFENSE LEADING IN THE MIDDLE. AL: FOUR RECEIVERS SET TO THE LEFT TO GO FOUR BY ONE. THE PASS GOES THAT WAY. WALKER MAKES THE CATCH. WALKER DOWN THE SIDELINE. HE SENT FOUR GUYS OUT THERE, WOULD YOU ALMOST NEVER SEE. SOMEBODY WILL HAVE AN ESCORT. KIRK: YOU RECOGNIZED IT BEFORE THE DEFENSE DID, AL. WATCH COOPER IN THE MIDDLE. THREE OUT IN FRONT. ABLE TO GET OUT THERE AS WELL. THATS REALLY AN EXTENSION. THIS IS A TEAM THAT PRIDES ITSELF ON THE OUTSIDE ZONE AND WILL RUN THE BALL TO SET UP PLAY ACTION BUT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RUN THE BALL THAT WELL. THEY ARE A LITTLE WRINKLED TO GET IT RUN GAME GOING EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A THROW. AL: THIS IS JACKSON SMITH. YOU NEVER SEE THAT. KIRK: YOU ARE RIGHT. THIS IS A TEAM THAT YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF TWO TIGHT ENDS. THEY WILL POUNDS YOU AND TRY TO RUN THE FOOTBALL. IT CANNOT BE ANYMORE DIFFERENT THAN WHO THEY WERE LAST YEAR WHEN RYAN DRUG WAS THERE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. AS YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE UNDER CENTER QUITE A BIT WITH SAM DARNOLD IN THIS NEW SYSTEM. HANDOFF HERE. BREAKING A TACKLE. WALKER BACKS OUT. RUNS INTO A PASSEL OF WHITE SHIRTS BEHIND THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. KIRK: THAT WAS BARRETT BROWNING COMING OFF THE EDGE. THIS IS A FUN DEFENSE TO WATCH BECAUSE IT IS SO CONFUSING. ROLLINS IS ONE OF THE BEST OFFENSIVE COORDINATORS IN THE LEAGUE. A YOUNG COORDINATOR AND EVENTUAL HEAD COACH. I THINK ALL OF HIS COLLEAGUES AROUND THE LEAGUE FEEL THAT WAY. HE HAS THIS DEFENSE PLAY ING WITH SO MUCH CONFIDENCE AND COMPLEX FOR THE OFFENSE TO FIGURE OUT BUT ITS SIMPLE AND ALLOWS THE DEFENSE TO PLAY FAST. AL: FIVE MINUTES INTO THE GAME, IT IS A THIRD DOWN AND 10 FOR THE SEAHAWKS. PRESSURE COMING. BENSON AWAY. CAUGHT AT THE 48 YARD LINE. KIRK: I THINK HE GOT IT. AL: CLOSE. WE WILL SEE WHETHER THEY SPOTTED. HE WAS STOPPED ABOUT THREE YARDS SHY. BAKER BLITZING ON THE PLAY. THEY ARE GOING TO PUT IT DOWN. STILL PUTTING IT DOWN. JUST OUTSIDE THE 47. SO THEY ARE ABOUT HALF A YARD SHY. HE GOT A FINGERTIP ON IT. WHAT A JOB BY HORTON. HE HAD A BIG KICKOFF RETURN. A CLINICAL CHECK HERE TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE ON FOURTH AND SHORT. AL: CHARBONNET IS THE BACK. GIVEN TO CHARBONNET. HE CANNOT MAKE IT. SO THE CARDINALS WERE ABLE TO STOP HIM JUST SHY OF THE 50 YARD LINE. ARIZONA GETTING THE BALL FOR THE SECOND TIME. NO SCORE. KIRK: JONATHAN GANNON TOLD US THEY NEEDED TO GET BETTER AT DEFENSIVE LINE AND GOT TOMLINSON. THE ROOKIE BLOWS THAT UP FROM THE INSIDE. THEN THE LINEBACKERS ARE ABLE TO GET THAT DOWNHILL. HE TRIES TO BALANCE IT AND THERES YEAR TWO LINEBACKERS CLEANING THAT UP. SO DONALD TO THE BENCH. HE STARTS THIS DRIVE FROM THE 48 YARD LINE. TREY BENSON, SECOND GUY OUT OF FLORIDA STATE. HE WILL BE THE NUMBER ONE GUY IN THE ABSENCE OF CONNER FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON. KNOCKED DOWN. TRYING TO SET UP THE SCREEN. THE FOURTH YEAR OUT OF MINNESOTA KNOCKING IT AWAY. KIRK: THAT IS THE CONCERN WITH MURRAY. THE SITUATION WITH HIM WITHOUT -- THROUGHOUT HIS ENTIRE CAREER. HE IS SECOND LOWEST TARGET DEPTH FOR -- PER PASS AND THEY ARE EXPECTING THESE QUICK THROWS. HECKUVA JOB. YOU CANNOT GET TO HIM, THAT IS THE NEXT BEST THING. SECOND AND 10. HANGS IN THERE. FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE AND ITS PICKED AT THE 32 YARD LINE. THE BALL IS LOOSE. AND AS THEY GO, THE CARDINALS SIGNAL THEY HAVE IT. HIS OWN GUY KNOCKED THE BALL OUT. I THINK HE RAN INTO HIM IN THE BALL CAME OUT. YOU NEED A BLOODHOUND TO FIGURE OUT WHO HAS IT AND THEY GET LUCKY WITH THE CARDINALS. HE HAS A HECK OF A PLACE SITTING IN SATTERFIELD. HIS OWN GUYS COMING BACK AND HE ACTUALLY GETS PUSHED INTO HIM. THE QUESTION BECOMES WAS HE DOWN? WAS HE TOUCHED? TO DECLARE HIM DOWN. A GREAT LOOK AT IT HERE. AL: THE TURNOVER IS REVIEWED. YOU DONT HAVE TO CHALLENGE. THEY CAN LOOK AT THIS AND TRY TO DISCERN. INTERCEPTION FOLLOWED BY A FUMBLE RECOVERED BY ARIZONA. THE PREVIOUS PLAY IS UNDER REVIEW. AL: I AFTER REVIEW, THE RULING ON THE FIELD STANDS. AL: THIS IS CRAZY. THE RULING ON THE FIELD GOES TO ARIZONA. MEANWHILE, SEATTLE THOUGHT THE REVIEW WAS IN THEIR FAVOR. THERE DEFENSE GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO CELEBRATE IN THE END ZONE AND ITS NOT THERE BALL. KIRK: COOPER HAD TO RUN OFF FROM THE SIDELINE AND SAY WE ARE STILL ON DEFENSE. AL: WE GOT THE INTERCEPTION BUT LOST THE BALL ON THE FUMBLE. THAT WAS CRAZY. PICKED UP FIVE YARDS ON THE EXCHANGE. ARIZONA AT THE 47 YARD LINE. TO THE OUTSIDE. A LOT OF ROOM AND A FIRST DOWN HERE FROM BENSON. KIRK: LETS GO BACK. WHAT GOT LOST HERE IS THE THROW. THEY ARE SHOWING A TWO HIGH SAFETY LOOK. NOW THEY ARE PLAYING MAN THREE. HE STEPS UP. MARVIN HARRISON STOPS AND MAKES IT AN EASY PICK FOR KOBE BRYANT. SO YOU HAVE MAN-TO-MAN. I STILL DONT KNOW IF HE WILL BE ABLE TO GET HIS HANDS ON THAT FOOTBALL. SNAPPED A LITTLE LOW. MARIE HANGS AND. GETTING AWAY IS BENSON. BENSON WITH A FLAG DOWN. WE HEAR FROM THE REFEREE. IN A MOMENT. PERSONAL FOUL, FACEMASK, DEFENSE, NUMBER 27. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. KIRK: OF ALL THE BACKS ON THIS DEFENSE, HE IS THE ONE GUY THAT DOES NOT COME UP WITH BAD INTENTIONS. HE IS COMING OUT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A PLAY WITH THE RIGHT HAND. IN THE RIGHT HAND GETS UP INTO THE FACEMASK. SO THE CARDINALS HAVE A LITTLE MOMENTUM AFTER THE INTERCEPTION. AND NOW THE PENALTY, THEY ARE INSIDE THE RED ZONE. NOT QUITE HALF THE DISTANCE. UNDER EIGHT TO PLAY IN THE QUARTER. SCORELESS AT THIS POINT. IN THE INSIDE TO DORTCH. HE IS TURNED BACK TO THE INSIDE. THAT STOPPED AT THE 14 YARD LINE BY LEONARD WILLIAMS. SEVERAL YEARS WITH THE GIANTS AND BEFORE THAT WITH THE JETS. ONLY ALLOWING 40% OF THE TIME. AND MIKE MCDONNELL A DEFENSE THAT KEEP THEIR EYES ON THE FOOTBALL AND THEY ARE SO GOOD AT DEFENDING THE RUN WITH THAT FRONT LINE OF LINEBACKERS GETTING DOWN THE HILL. AL: BENSON GOING BACK AND FORTH ON A SECOND AND SEVEN. THATS CAUGHT AT THE 11 YARD LINE. THE TIGHT END MAKES THEIR SECOND CATCH OF THE NIGHT, 19TH OF THE SEASON. THIRD AND 5. KIRK: HE HAS TO BE A BIGGER FACTOR HERE DOWN THE RED ZONE. NICE TOUCHDOWN LAST WEEK AGAINST SAN FRANCISCO. IF HE DOES NOT WIN, WHO ELSE WILL? YOU WOULD THINK MARVIN HARRISON COULD BE THAT GUY BUT SOMEONE HAS TO WIN. LIKE WE SAY, WHEN THINGS HAPPEN FASTER DOWN IN THIS RED ZONE. AL: THIRD AND 5. HARRISON IN THE SLOT TO THE LEFT. AND A FLAG HERE. FALSE START, OFFENSE, NUMBER 73. 5-YARD PENALTY, THIRD DOWN. AL: JONAH WILLIAMS. HE IS THE RIGHT TACKLE. KIRK: JUST A SMALL FLINCH BY 73. THAT IS WHAT BRINGS WILLIAMS OVER. AL: THAT IS MINUSCULE. KIRK: I WAS GOING TO SAY. YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GET A SUPER SLOW-MO TO GET THAT. KIRK: DIFFERENT BALLGAME NOW WITH THIRD AND 9. AL: BACK AT THE 15 YARD LINE. KIRK: BETTER CONTAINED MURRAY, THE THREAT TO SCRAMBLE HERE ON THIRD DOWN. AL: OUT OF THE POCKET. THROWS. CAUGHT. GETS AWAY DOES DORTCH BUT NOT FAR ENOUGH TO PICK UP THE FIRST. SO HE STOPPED JUST INSIDE THE 10 YARD LINE. KIRK: WHAT A GREAT THING WHEN YOU CAN GET THAT KIND OF PRESSURE. THEY ARE GETTING UPFIELD TO PREVENT HIM FROM ESCAPING. YOU ARE ALLOWED TO PLAY ZONE, KEEP THEIR EYES ON THE THREAT OF HIM TAKING OFF AND THEN YOU JUST HAVE TO TACKLE AND WRAP UP WHEN THEY THROW THE BALL UNDERNEATH. AL: KYLER FRUSTRATED HE COULD NOT MOVE IT ANY FARTHER THAN THAT AS JAN RYLAND COMES IN FOR A CHIP SHOT. 27 YARDS. SIX OUT OF EIGHT THIS SEASON. FIVE YARD PENALTY, FOURTH DOWN. NOT THE WORST THING IN THE WORLD. THAT WILL MAKE IT A 32 YARD FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT. GILLIGAN TO HOLD IT. MEANWHILE, AARON BREWER WILL SNAP IT TO FIRST. THESE WORDS FROM ALEX KEMP. IT IS JUST A MATTER OF RESETTING THE CLOCK. SO IT GETS RESET AT 25. A 32 YARD ATTEMPT. AFTER ALL THAT, THE KICK IS RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE. 4:30 REMAINING IN THE QUARTER. IT IS 3-0 ARIZONAAL: JAN RYLAND WILL KICK OFF. EACH TEAM COMING IN 2-1. THE CARDINALS AND SEAHAWKS ARE ALL 2-1. FROM THE 4 YARD LINE. COVERAGE IS GOOD. DARNOLD, WHO HAD A FABULOUS REGULAR SEASON, HAD A TERRIBLE NIGHT. HE GOT SACKED NINE TIMES. THAT ENDED MINNESOTA STREAM LAST YEAR. THE 23 YARD LINE. OFF THE FAKE. THE PASS IS CAUGHT ON THE OUTSIDE. PICKING UP THE FIRST DOWN IS ELIJAH ARROYO. SO DONALD COMES IN,. HE WILL BASICALLY BE A PLACEHOLDER FOR J.J. MCCARTHY. MINNESOTA ONE POINT THOUGHT MAYBE WE WILL PUT MCCARTHY ON THE BENCH. KIRK: A TOUGH DECISION. I THINK THEY FELT MCCARTHY WAS CLEARLY THERE GUY. BUT BOY DID SAM DARNOLD RESURRECT HIS CAREER LAST YEAR IN MINNESOTA. AL: HERES WALKER. NICE MOVE. HES CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN. KIRK: GREAT ATHLETE AND TACKLE. YOU WILL SEE THEY GET PRETTY PHYSICAL, WILLING TO GET TO THE EDGE. THEY WILL STICK WITH IT WITH THE HOPES OF GETTING AHEAD AND PUTTING SAM DARNOLD IN THOSE PLAY ACTION OPPORTUNITIES WHERE HE IS SO EFFECTIVE. SECOND AND ONE. KEEP IT ON THE GROUND. WALKER AROUND TO THE RIGHT SIDE WITH A BURST. AGAIN OF 21. KIRK: ABRAHAM LUCAS, THAT IS THE KEY BLOCK. HES ABLE TO GET A GOOD PUSH TO SEAL THAT EDGE, PUSH COLLINS. PUSH AND WITH THE RIGHT ARM JUST ENOUGH TO ALLOW KENNETH WALKER. HES INSIDE AND SEES THE GRASS, BOUNCES IT AND USES THAT SPEED AND INSTINCT AND VISION TO GET THOSE YARDS. THAT IS THE SEATTLE RUNNING GAME THEY WANT. AL: WALKER, TWO RUSHING TOUCHDOWNS AGAINST THE SAINTS SUNDAY. WE GO TO KAYLEE. KAYLEE: SAM DARNOLD HAS BEEN THROUGH A LOT IN HIS EIGHT NFL SEASONS AND COOPER KUPP LEAVES HIS ABILITY TO WEATHER THE JOURNEY IS AN ELITE TRAIT. BAD EXPERIENCES CAN SCAR A QUARTERBACK BUT KUPP SAID DARN OLD DOES A GOOD JOB SEPARATING THE GOOD FROM THE BAD. RIGHT ON CUE. HE KNOWS HOW TO MOVE ON. EARLY IN HIS CAREER, HE WAS THROWING MANY INTERCEPTIONS. IN FOUR YEARS HE HAD 52 INTERCEPTIONS. IT IS BECAUSE OF WHAT KAYLEE MENTIONED, TRYING TO MAKE A PLAY. THAT GOT ELIMINATED FROM HIS GAME LAST YEAR. HE IS MUCH MORE DECISIVE AND IT HAS CONTINUED IN SEATTLE THE EARLY PART OF THIS YEAR. AL: THIRD AND 2. LOOKS TO HIS LEFT. FIRES TO HIS LEFT EARED CAUGHT -- TO HIS LEFT. CAUGHT. TO THE 16 YARD LINE GOES COOPER KUPP. THE FANS SERENADING HIM. HE HAD A SPECTACULAR 2021 SEASON, SUPER BOWL UBP WITH THE RAMS -- M.V.P. WITH THE RAMS. KIRK: HE IS DROPPING TOWARDS COOPER KUPP FOR THAT VERY REASON. ON THIRD DOWN THERES A CHANCE THEY WILL LOOK UP TO THE SLOT AND FIND NUMBER KNOWN -- NUMBER 10. GOOD JOB BY SAM DARNOLD GETTING HIM OUT IN A HURRY TO GIVE COOPER KUPP A CHANCE. AL: THE 16. CAUGHT. TOUCHDOWN, AJ BARNER, THE TIGHT END. KIRK: THERE IS A GUY THAT I THINK SEATTLE IS EXCITED ABOUT. HE GETS A GREAT LOOK AT IT HERE. 88 AGAINST 27. A LITTLE HESITATION, THEN DOWN AND UP EARED -- AND UP. LOOK AT THE PLACEMENT OF THE FOOTBALL. THE BIG TALENTED TIGHT END WHO KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER MATCHED UP AGAINST A LINEBACKER. EASY THROW AT A NICE CATCH FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. HIS SECOND TD OF THE SEASON. SO THE CARDINALS GET A FIELD GOAL. SEATTLE RESPONDS WITH A TOUCHDOWN. 1:30 TO GO IN THE OPENING QUARTER. IT IS ARIZONA ON THIS THURSDAY NIGHT. YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE AMALFI COAST. KIRK: I HAVE. ONE OF MY FEW TRIPS TO EUROPE. AL: GREG DORTCH FROM THE GOAL LINE. GETS SPILLED. THE TACKLE IS MADE BY YOUNG. ITS A SOPHISTICATED DEFENSE. THAT IS HOW HE GOT THE JOB. HE WAS THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR FOR JOHN HARBAUGH FOR YEARS. HE SPENT ONE SEASON WITH JIM OVER AT MICHIGAN. KIRK: THIS BEING THE SECOND YEAR OF HIS DEFENSE, MUCH MORE CONTINUITY. SECOND LOWEST BLITZ RATE IN THE NFL YET FOURTH HIGHEST PRESSURE RATE, MEANING THEY DONT HAVE TO BRING PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE SO GIFTED UP FRONT ON THIS OFFENSIVE LINE. AL: THIS TIME THE LINEUP SITS ACROSS. AGAIN OF FOUR YARDS. BENSON OVER THE LEFT SIDE. KIRK: I LOVE WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THIS DEFENSE. THEY ARE TOUGH AND THEY ARE CONNECTED. IF YOU WATCHED THEM PLAY IN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS, WHEN YOU WATCH THE FILM AND THEIR PURSUIT ANGLES AND WATCH THEM FLY TO THE BALL, ITS A GREAT DESCRIPTION. TOUGH AND CONNECTED. AND YOU WILL SEE HOW THE GAME PLAYS OUT. IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED A LOT OF SEATTLE, RICHARD SHERMAN HAS TO BE PROUD OF THIS SECONDARY AND THE STYLE IN WHICH THEY PLAY. AL: WITHOUT DOUBT. LOOK OUT. THROUGH THE MIDDLE. THAT TIME HE IS THE GUY. HE COMES IN THROUGH THE MIDDLE. AL: HE IS ANOTHER GUY. YOU THINK OF DERICK HALL, LAWRENCE, WILLIAMS AND INSTEAD IT IS HIM WHO IS GETTING HEALTHIER. LAST YEAR, IT IS WHAT THEY SAID WAS THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE SEEN HIM FLASHED SINCE COMING BACK FROM INJURY. ISAIAH ADAMS REALLY LOCATED HIM. AL: THE WAITING SECONDS OF THE QUARTER APPEARED THIS WILL BE A -- OF THE QUARTER. THIS WILL BE A 32ND QUARTER. HIS PEDIGREE IS DEFENSE. HE CALLS THE DEFENSE. ON THE OTHER SIDE, JONATHAN GANNON, HIS PEDIGREE IS DEFENSE. HE SAID WHEN I GOT THE JOB I AM NOT CALLING IT THE DEFENSE. KIRK: FIRST OF ALL, WHO ADMITS THAT WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT AN INTERVIEW PROCESS, BUT HE SAID HE HAD OTHER INTERVIEWS AND OPPORTUNITIES BUT MADE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT EVEN THOUGH YOURE HIRING ME BECAUSE OF THE JOB I DID IN PHILLY, I WANT TO BE THE HEAD COACH. I DONT WANT TO BE THAT. ARIZONA SAID YOU ARE HIRED. YOU ARE OUR GUY. BUT IT IS INTERESTING. TWO DEFENSIVE MINDED HEAD COACHES DOING IT VERY DIFFERENTLY. AL: MURRAY AROUND THE CORNER. A COUPMEANWHILE, LAWRENCE WENT INTO THE TENT. HE IS SLOWLY GETTING UP. HERE IS THE PUNT. ITS A GOOD ONE. RAM ONE BACK 95 YARDS LAST WEEK. AND HE IS STOPPED AT THE 25 YARD LINE. THE SEAHAWKS HAVE A GREAT HOME FIELD ADVANTAGE BUT ON THE ROAD NOW THEY ARE 10 AND ONE FOR THE LAST 11 ROAD GAMES. SEVEN STRAIGHT ROAD WINS, 4-8 AT HOME. KIRK: WHO WOULD HAVE EVER THOUGHT THAT? IT IS GREAT THAT THEY HAVE THAT ROAD FOCUS AND HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO GO AWAY FROM THE FRIENDLY CONFINES BUT WE ALL THINK ABOUT THE 12, WE THINK ABOUT SEATTLE BEING ONE OF THE TOUGHEST PLACES TO PLAY. CHARBONNET IS THE RUNNING BACK. TO THE OUTSIDE, TURNS THE CORNER. AND SEATTLE WAS SO GREAT AT HOME DURING THE CARROLL ERA, A LOT OF TIMES THE LEAGUE WOULD NOT GIVE SEATTLE PRIMETIME GAMES BECAUSE THEY WERE BLOWING EVERYBODY OUT. THAT USED TO GET PETE CARROLL CRAZY. KIRK: AND YOU PROBABLY. AL: OF COURSE. SECOND AND 7. OVER TO THE LEFT SIDE THIS TIME GOES CHARBONNET. AND A FLAG COMES IN. KIRK: WAY BACK FROM CENTERFIELD. THAT WAS ABOUT A 22 YARD THROW. DEFENSE, NUMBER 70, A FIVE YARD PENALTY. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. KIRK: HE REALLY LET THAT FLY. GOOD JOB OF RECOGNIZING IT HIS WAY BACK, AND HE SAW THIS. CLIMBING UP TO THAT SECOND LEVEL. THAT LEFT ARM LOCKED UP AROUND THE NECK. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING A LOT TONIGHT ABOUT SEATTLES DEFENSIVE LINE BUT TOMLINSON, CAMPBELL, ROBINSON, STILLS, THE CARDINALS HAVE A REALLY GOOD GROUP AS WELL. THAT WAS AN EMPHASIS COMING INTO THIS YEAR. AL: NOWHERE TO GO. ON FIRST DOWN. ZACH CHARBONNET IS STOPPED THERE. CHARBONNET OUT OF UCLA, 64", 214. WALKER IS THAT HE GUY. KIRK: THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR IS WILSON. WENT DOWN AFTER THAT PLAY. AND THEY HAVE HAD SO MANY INJURIES ALREADY. THEIR TOP THREE CORNERS ARE OUT ON THIS DEFENSE. NOW MACK WILSON IS DOWN. AL: AND WILL JOHNSON, WHO IS THE SECOND ROUND PICK OUT OF MICHIGAN, IS INACTIVE AS WELL. KIRK: YOU GO BACK TO SEAN MURPHY, WILLIAMS, NOW WILL JOHNSON. THEY ARE DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF SURVIVING WITHOUT THEM, PLAYING A LOT OF ZONE, BUT AT THE END OF THE PLAY. HES ABLE TO GET UP AND WALK OFF. LOOKS LIKE HE WILL GET BACK. AL: TO 10 HE WILL GO. THEY WILL PLAY SECOND DOWN AND 12. KIRK: THIS IS A DEFENSE THAT HAS HAD TO MOVE A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND. THEY HAVE SUCH GREAT VERSATILITY. WITH THOMPSON, BECAUSE OF THE INJURIES TO THE CORNERS WE MENTIONED, HE IS HAVING TO NOW MOVE AROUND AND PLAY DIFFERENT SPOTS. NOW YOU LOSE MACK WILSON. AL: UP IN MOTION. DARNOLD GETS THAT WAY AND IS SWALLOWED UP AT THE 30 YARD LINE. THAT TIME, AARON BROWNING AND CAMPBELL BOTH COMING IN. CALAIS IS CAMPBELL, 39 YEARS OLD, 18TH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE. KIRK: WE ALL LOVE TO SEE HIM OUT THERE. 18 YEARS. 39 YEARS OF AGE. WATCH THE GET OFF BY BARRETT BROWNING. A SPRINTERS STANCE. I WILL TELL YOU, HE PLAYED LINEBACKER AT OHIO STATE AND DENVER. HE SETTLED IN AS AN EDGE PLAYER IN THIS DEFENSE AND HIS PASS RUSH IS JUST AS DOMINANT. IT IS SWEPT ON THE OTHER SIDE. AL: THIRD AND AL: THIRD AND 19. WALKER ON HIS FEET PICKS UP ABOUT THREE. SO SEATTLE IS GOING TO PUNT. THE PUNT IS BECOMING LIKE AN ARTIFACT. THE FIELD GOALS ARE SO LONG. THE TEAMS ARE GOING FOR IT. THE PUT UPPER CAN TAKE MOST OF THE NIGHT OFF. KIRK: IT'S THE TIME OF YEAR WHERE BASEBALL YOU GET INTO THE PLAYOFFS. SOMETIMES YOU GO TO A BASEBALL GAME AND IT'S AN UGLY GAME. THEN YOU GO TO A 2-1 GAME AND IT'S A BATTLE BACK AND FORTH. THIS IS GOING TO BE A BATTLE OF TWO GOOD DEFENSES GOING AT EACH OTHER TONIGHT. AL: CAMPBELL HAS GOT THREE SACKS ALREADY THIS YEAR. SKY HIGH KICK. FIELDED THE 13-YARD LINE BY DO DORTCH. BEEN UNDER THE RADAR BUT IS SENSATIONAL. MEANWHILE CAMPBELL -- KIRK: 39 YEARS OLD HE'S REALLY LIKE A COACH TALKING TO THE LINEMEN. AND THEY RESPOND TO HIM TOO. AL: A LITTLE BIT OF ROOM ON THE LEFT SIDE. AN EIGHT-YARD PICKUP BY BENSON TO START OFF SECOND DOWN AND TWO. KIRK: ANY TIME YOU LOSE ONE OF YOUR ALPHAS, IT'S DEVASTATING AND CONNER WENT DOWN WITH THAT SEASON-ENDING INJURY, THEY LOST THEIR CAPTAIN. BUT BENSON HAS A LOT OF ABILITY. AL: NO ONE IS AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD AGAINST HARRISON. KIRK: WE'VE SEEN THIS A LOT WITH MAR RINNE HARRISON AND KYLER MURRAY JUST NOT ON THE SAME PAGE. HE'S UP AT THE FAR RIGHT. HE'S RUNNING ONE ROUTE. COVERAGE JUST LATE. HE'S RUNNING A FADE TO THAT COVERAGE. AND KYLER MURRAY IS EXPECTING HIM TO STAY ON THE ROUTE AND CUT OUT. WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF. THAT THEY'RE STILL KIND OF WORKING THROUGH SOME THINGS. HOPEFULLY THAT GETS ON TRACK TOO. AL: THAT FAN BASE IS MORE AND MORE FRUSTRATED. THIRD AND 2 TO THE OUTSIDE. FALLING DOWN AND MAKING THAT GRAB. FIRST DOWN IS MICHAEL WILSON FROM STANFORD. KIRK: THE QUESTION WITH THIS OFFENSE IS WHO OTHER THAN KYLER MURRAY IS GOING TO THE MAKE PLAYS. MCBRIDE BUT WHO ELSE? IS IT GOING TO BE BENSON, HARRISON? THEY NEED OTHERS TO STEP UP. AL: IT'S GOING UNDER BENEATH. GOING TO GET FREE FOR A FEW MORE YARDS. WITHERSPOON IS ABLE TO FINAL LIQUOR REAL -- FINALLY CORRAL BENSON. KIRK: YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE MARVIN HARRISON. SECOND YEAR, 6'3", 220. I FEEL LIKE WHEN I WATCH HIM BECAUSE I'VE WATCHED HIM A LOT THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER, HE LOOKS LIKE A GUY THINKING TOO MUCH. DOESN'T HAVE HIS CONFIDENCE. AL: MURRAY HAS THE SECOND PASS BATTERED. THIRD DOWN AND 7. SO 6'5" WILLIAMS TAKES CARE OF THE 5'10" MURRAY. KIRK: I THINK HE'S STILL TRYING TO FIND THAT CONFIDENCE THAT HE PLAYED WITH IN COLLEGE. MAYBE A LITTLITY MID. NEEDS TO TURN IT LOOSE -- MAYBE A A LITTLE TIMID. NEEDS TO TURN IT LOOSE. AL: THIRD AND 7. MURRAY. OFF-BALANCE THROWS. AND THERE'S THE MAIN MAN, MCBRIDE. PICKS UP ENOUGH FOR THE FIRST DOWN. KIRK: THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD US THAT THEY HAD TO DO WITHOUT JAMES CONNER. WE'RE GOING TO RUN THE BALL AND LET THEM KNOW WE HAVE IT. CERTAINLY, IT'S A GAME ABOUT GETTING THE BALL IN SPACE AND ABOUT GUYS MAKING PEOPLE MISS. HERE MCBRIDE MAKES HIM MISS. THEY GET THE FIRST DOWN ON THIRD DOWN. GOOD CONVERSION. AL: NO HUDDLE. UPTEMPO HERE AT THE SEATTLE 49 TO THE RIGHT SIDE. AND THERE HE IS AGAIN, MCBRIDE. FIRST DOWN. HEY, COME ON. LET'S GET INTO IT HERE. KIRK: SURPRISE SEATTLE OF ALL -- WE JUST SAID THE ONE GUY THAT CAN HURT YOU IS RIGHT HERE. SURPRISED THEY'RE GIVING HIM A FREE RELEASE. THAT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH TO STOP ANY TIME LET ALONE TR EVENINGEY MCBRIDE. OUT IN THE FLATTENED ZONE COVERAGE. PERFECTLY THROWN FOOTBALL AND A GOOD ROUTE. AL: ARIZONA'S LONGEST PLAY OF THE NIGHT. FIRST DOWN AT THE 32-YARD LINE. PLAY FAKE. DOWN THE SIDELINE. IT'S OUT OF BOUNDS. XAVIER WEAVER, FIRST TIME IT HAS GONE HIS WAY. SECOND AND 10. KIRK: GOOD JOB WITH JOSH JOBE WHO HAS BECOME A MUCH MORE CONSISTENT CORNER IN THIS DEFENSE IN HIS SECOND YEAR, REALLY UNDERSTANDING -- THIS GUY WAS ON THE PRACTICE SQUAD A YEAR AGO. THERE WERE SOME INJURIES. HE WORKED HIS WAY UP TO BECOME THAT THIRD CORNER LAST YEAR. AND NOW HERE HE IS STARTING AS CORNER ON ONE OF THE TOP DEFENSES IN THE NFL. AND I THINK HE'S PLAYING WITH A LOT MORE CONFIDENCE AND THAT TIME IN PHASE, GOOD COVERAGE ON THE FADE DOWN THE SIDELINE. AL: SECOND DOWN, NINTH PLAY OF THE DRIVE. UNDERNEATH. BENSON TRYING TO GET AWAY. BUT HIS KNEE IS DOWN. THEY WHISTLE HEM DOWN RIGHT THERE. TYRICE KNIGHT MADE THE TACKLE. KIRK: THE THING THAT IS KIND OF COOL ABOUT SEATTLE IS THEY DON'T PANIC. YOU'RE GETTING INTO THEIR TERRITORY. BUT THEY HAVE SUCH CONFIDENCE IN THAT ZONE. PRIMARILY A ZONE DEFENSE, WHICH ALLOWS THE LINEBACKERS, SAFETIES, CORNERS TO KEEP THEIR EYES ON THE CORNERBACK. THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE UP SOME YARDS. BUT THE CLOSER YOU GET INTO THEIR TERRITORY AND THE DEEPER YOU GET THAT EVENTUALLY THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SQUEEZE YOU AND MAKE YOU HAVE TO KICK A FIELD GOAL. AL: THIRD AND 11. MURRAY THROWS, JUG JUGGLED AND INTERCEPT. NOW YOU HAVE EARNEST JONES THE PICK AND THE RUN BACK INTO ARIZONA TERRITORY. KIRK: WHAT A JOB BY KYLER MURRAY. WHAT A THROW HERE. HE PUTS IT RIGHT ON MARVIN HARRISON AND YET ANOTHER DROP FOR MARVIN HARRISON. WE TALKED ABOUT A GUY WHO MIGHT BE THINKING TOO MUCH. GOES INTO TRAFFIC. DOESN'T FOCUS TO BE ABLE TO HOLD ON FOR THAT FIRST DOWN CATCH. KIRK: WHEN YOU'RE THE FOURTH PICK OVERALL LAST YEAR, THERE ARE GOING TO BE BIG EXPECTATIONS. THIS BECOMES A THEME. ON THE CROSSING ROUTE. BALL IS PICKED OFF. THEY'RE LUCKY TO GET THIS ONE BACK. MISCOMMUNICATION. THIRD AND SHORT. HE ADJUSTS TO A FADE. LOOKING AHEAD TRYING TO SEE WHERE THE -- WHERE THE CONTACT MAKE MIGHT BE. NOT ABLE TO FINISH ON THE PLAY. AND AGAIN, I THINK YOU SEE A GUY WHO IS UBERLY TALENTED, JUST NOT PLAYING WITH CONFIDENCE. IT'S LIKE HIS MIND IS PARALYZING HIS ABILITY TO BE THE RECEIVER HE CAN BE. AL: THE TURNOVER. SEATTLE HAS THE BALL AT THE 29-YARD LINE OFF THE PLAY FAKE. PLENTY OF TIME IN THE POCKET. DEEP DOWNFIELD. AND IT'S JUGGLED AND NOT CAUGHT. TORRY HORTON IS THERE. MELTON IS ABLE TO BREAK IT UP AT THE END. KIRK: THEY WENT WITH A THREE TIGHT END LOOK. YOU THINK THEY WERE GOING TO RUN THE FOOTBALL. THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO STRETCH THIS DEFENSE. ADD THEY GOT EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANTED WITH THE SPEEDSTER. THIS GUY CAN REALLY FLY. WE'VE SEEN THAT ALREADY AS A ROOKIE. THAT BALL IS ON. IT'S A GOOD JOB RECOVERING BY 16. MAX MELTON. BUT SAM DARNOLD GAVE THE ROOKIE A CHANCE. DEFENSIVE BACK. DOESN'T EVEN SEE THE FOOTBALL. WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT CATCH. BUT THE BALL WAS ON HIM. WOULD LOVE TO SEE HIM BREAK THAT ONE DOWN. AL: HAD TWO RECEIVING TOUCHDOWN AND A 95-YARD PUNT RETURN. DARNOLD OVER THE MIDDLE. GOES TO HIS THIRD OPTION. AND JAKE BOBO MAKES HIS FIRST CATCH. KIRK: YOU SAW WHAT I SAW. HE'S LOOKING LEFT. BUT WATCH HIS FEET IN RHYTHM. INSTEAD OF BEING LATE, HE'S DECISIVE. THERE'S THE EYES TO THE LEFT. NOPE. COME BACK. LOOK AT HIS FEET. PUTS IT ON HIM. AND A NICE FIRST DOWN. AL: HE HAD NJIGBA. FINDS THE OPEN GUY. HALFWAY THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER. FIRST DOWN. FROM THE 32 AD YARD LINE. PICKING UP FOUR. KENNETH WALKER TO THE 28 YARD LINE. KAYLEE.PDATE, KAYLE? HE'S BACK INTO THE LOCKER ROOM TO GET HIS ANKLE CHECKED OUT. DEFENSIVE LINEMAN DEMARCUS LAWRENCE, HE IS DOUBTFUL TO RETURN BECAUSE OF THE THIGH INJURY. YOU SEE HIM ON THE BENCH. AL: 11 YEARS AT DALLAS. PROBABLY DONE FOR THE NIGHT FROM THE 28-YARD LINE TO THE OUTSIDE AND A NICE FIRST DOWN SAVING TACKLE THAT WALKER MADE ON CLARK. KIRK: THEY HAVE FLAGS WELL AFTER THE WHISTLE. AL: TWO FLAGS. KIRK: HE GRABBED ON TO THE FOOT OF KENNETH WALKER. AND THEN HE THREW THE BALL AT CLARK AND THAT'S WHEN THE FLAGS CAME IN. REFEREE: AFTER THE PLAY WAS OVER, TAUNTING, OFFENSE NUMBER NINE, THAT'S A 15-YARD PENALTY. THAT WILL BE THIRD DOWN. UNSPORTSMANLIKE ACTION TOWARDS DISQUALIFICATION. KIRK: THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE -- I'M NOT SAYING IT'S OK. BUT WALKER RESPONDED TO CLARK AFTER THE TACKLE. THE PLAY IS DEAD. HE GRABS ON TO HIS FOOT. YOU'LL SEE IT HERE ATTACKLE. GRAB ON TO THE LEG. GAVE HIM A LITTLE SHOVE. WALKER HAS GOT TO WALK AWAY. INSTEAD HE POINTS AND ENDS UP TOSSING A BALL AT HIM RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE REF. AL: WELL, THE LEAGUE PUT AN EVERYONE SAYS ON -- AN EMPHASIS ON TALK AND TURNED IT INTO A FELONY. KIRK: GOOD WAY OF SAYING IT. AL: THIRD DOWN AND 18. SETS UP A SCREEN. BUT A GREAT TACK IS MADE THERE AT THE 44-YEAR-OLDLINE. CALAIS CAMPBELL. ANOTHER GREAT PLAY FOR THE 39 39-YARD. 39 3939-YEAR-OLD. I DON'T THINK ABOUT THE BIG PICTURE PLAYING THE 40. WE'RE JUST ENJOYING WATCHING THIS GUY. HE'S NOT A KICKER OR A QUARTERBACK TRYING TO GET TO 40. HE'S A DEFENSIVE LINEMAN IN THE TRENCHES. KIRK:-- AL: HERE'S DICKSON. ANOTHER PUNT. AND DIXON EITHER. KIRK: DID THEY SCORE ON THAT POSSESSION? DO YOU REMEMBER? AL: NOW I HAVE TO GO INTO MY MEMORY BANK. KIRK: YOU KNOW EVERYTHING. AL: I USED TO. I THINK I KNOW THAT. KIRK: IT'S YOUR STOMPING GROUNDS. KIRK: IT IS. ARIZONA STATEMENT BUT WE'RE HERE IN GLENDALE JUST OUTSIDE. ANYWAY -- ARIZONA STATE. BUT WE'RE HERE IN GLENDALE JUST OUTSIDE. HE'S OFFICE TO THE RACES. KIRK: GAVE YOU AN IDEA ABOUT THE FIRING OF D.K. METCALF. AL: FORMER SEA HAWK -- FORMER -- AND NOW WITH PITTSBURGH, HERE'S MCBRIDE. I'M NOW TOLD BY OUR VAST RESEARCH DEPARTMENT, SEATTLE HELD THEM WITHOUT A TOUCHDOWN. THERE WE GO. KIRK: HE'S REWARDED FOR THAT EFFORT. AL: HE'S BEEN A GREAT PLAYER THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, AS WELL AS METCALF. BUDDA BAKER HERE. KIRK: TRYING TO STAY AFTER THAT INJURY. AL: THIRD DOWN AND 2. KIRK: GIVES MURRAY A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE DEFENSE. GETTING THE RIGHT PLAY ON THIRD AND SHORT. AL: MICHAEL CARTER IS GOING TO CARRY FOR THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT. THAT'S GOING TO GET TO THE THIRD YARD LINE. SO CARTER FIFTH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE. BEEN AROUND. HASN'T PLAYED THIS YEAR. KIRK: LIKE I SAID, THAT'S KYLER MURRAY LOOKING AT THE DEFENSE THINKING HE'S GOT A NUMBERS ADVANTAGE. BUT THE PROBLEM IS EVEN THOUGH THERE'S ONLY FOUR LINEMEN AND TWO LINEBACKERS, THEY DON'T COMMIT SAFETIES. THAT TIME IT WAS REED WHO WAS ABLE TO GET OFF THAT BLOCK AND KEEP SHORTER -- SHORT OFF THE FIRST DOWN. AL: PUNT. REALLY GOOD ONE. TO THE 9-YARD LINE. HERE'S HORTON. SPRINGS FREE. HALF THE WHITE SHIRTS ON THE FIELD MAKE THE TACKLE THERE. 63-YARD PUNT. TWO-YARD RETURN. WE WILL RETURN IN A HALF MINUTE SAM DARNOLD, THIRD OVERALL PICK BY THE JETS BACK IN 2018. CAROLINA, SAN FRANCISCO AND MINNESOTA, NOW SEATTLE. DANCING IN THE POCKET. KEEPS HIS EYES DOWNFIELD. DEEP THROW IS GOING TO BE HONED IN. DOWNFIELD. ALL THE WAY DOWNFIELD. ELIJAH ARROYO A ROOKIE OUT OF MIAMI. A GAIN OF 32. KIRK: HE GOT DOWNFIELD OVER JOSH SWEAT WHO WILL RUSH THE QUARTERBACK HERE IN HIS OWN PRESSURE. NOW HE'S DROPPING AND SAM DARNOLD, HE HAD ROOM TO RUN. BUT HE SEES THIS MATCHUP. THERE'S NO WAY SWEAT IS GOING FIND THE FOOTBALL. LET HIM ADJUST BACK. DID A GREAT JOB OF RECOGNIZING THAT OPPORTUNITY THERE BY SAM DARNOLD. AL: ARROYO, 6'5", SECOND ROUND PICK OUT OF MIAMI. LOOK AT THAT TIME FOR DARNOLD. SAM WILL TAKE OFF! DARNOLD STOPS AT THE 32-YARD LINE. KIRK: THIS IS WHAT HE DOES. HE USUALLY MAKES YOU PAY WITH THE ARM. HE SEES MAN-TO-MAN COVERAGE. WHY NOT TAKE OFF. THE LINEBACKERS ARE OUT. THE SAFETIES ARE OUT. EVERYBODY'S GOT THEIR BACK TURNED TO HIM. HE'S GOT THE ATHLETIC ABLE. AL: JUST GOES RIGHT TO THE LINE. THAT GO OVER TO THE RIGHT SIDE. AND OVER THE CORNER GOES CHARBONNET OVER A LUCAS FLOP. KIRK: I KNOW THAT'S YOUR FAVORITE. THE OLD PEN AND POLE, GOOD JOB BY THE RECEIVERS FEELING THE EDGE AND THEN THEY ARE ABLE TO GAIN THAT PERIMETER RUN. IF YOU'RE A SEATTLE FAN, THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE WHETHER IT'S OUTSIDE ZONE OR AL'S FAVORITE THE PEN AND POLE, GET THAT RUN GA MATCHUP. AL: TO TITANS GAME. KIRK: NEW STADIUM IN A COUPLE OF YEARS. MAYBE IN 2027. AL: AT THE 19-YARD LINE AS CHARBONNET PICKS UP ONE. KIRK: BEEN A GOOD DRIVE OBVIOUSLY BY SAM DARNOLD IN COMMAND. WE'VE GOT A BIG OPPORTUNITY HERE. 145 AND COUNTING. THEY'VE GOT A CHANCE LIKE WE TALK ABOUT EVERY WEEK A TWO FOR ONE A CHANCE TO SCORE HERE. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE IN A HURRY HERE TO GIVE MURRAY MUCH TIME TO WORK WITH. AND THEN THEY GET THE BALL TO START THE SECOND HALF. AL: 1:30. SECOND AND 8. DEEP, DEEP DROP. END ZONE. FLAG IS THROWN. AND INCOMPLETE. INTENDED FOR ARROYO. BAKER SAYS -- REFEREE: PASS INTERFERENCE. DEFENSE NUMBER THREE. THE BALL GOES TO THE ONE--YARD LINE. FIRST DOWN. KIRK: WE BRAG A LOT ABOUT BUDDA BAKER. AND HE IS IN A TOUGH SPOT WHERE HE TURNS REALLY NEVER FINDS THE FOOTBALL AND MAKES THE INTERFERENCE RIGHT THERE. HE TRIES TO STRIP IT. LET'S GO BACK TO THE TROLL BY SAM DARNOLD. OFF OF THE PLAY ACTION, HE'S BEEN SHOWING THIS A LOT. ABILITY. GREAT TECHNIQUE. LOOK AT HIM FALLING BACK AND THROWING TO HIS LEFT. AND LOOK AT THAT LOCATION OF THAT BALL, RIGHT ON THE MONEY. BUT BAKER OUT OF POSITION THERE. THAT TIME THE TIGHT END GOT BEHIND HIM AND HAD TO PLAY CATCH-UP. AL: FROM THE 1. STUMBLE AS LITTLE BIT. AND CHARBONNET IS STOPPED AT THE ONE-YARD LINE. SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. 110. KIRK: I THINK HE GOT STEPPED ON BY BRADFORD, THE RIGHT TACKLE -- THE RIGHT GUARD, RATHER. THAT FOOT RIGHT THERE LOOKS LIKE IT GOT HIM GOOD JOB, THE ATHLETIC ABILITY BY DARNOLD TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE FOG. I MEAN, THAT'S A BIG MAN AT 335. AND A HECK OF A JOB EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T SCORE JUST FINISHING THAT PLAY. AL: STEPPED O ON -- ON BY ANY OFFENSIVE LINEMAN IT'S A CONCERN. SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. CHARBONNET AND RUSSELL. RUSSELL IS THE FOOL BACK. CHARBONNET IS THE TAILBACK. ROLLING. THROWING. THAT'S INCOMPLETE. TRY TO GET THAT ONE TO ELIJAH ARROYO. OUR FRIEND PETER SHRAGER WAS OUT THING HIM. KIRK: HE'S DONE A GOOD JOB OF GETTING OUTSIDE AND THROWING. BE HE'S GOT THE LEFT GUARD, THE ROOKIE OUT THERE IN FRONT. IF HE BREAKS, HE GOES OUT TO THE CORNER WITH 76 OUT IN FRONT OF HIM. I KNOW HE WANTS TO KEEP THE VISION DOWNFIELD. BUT BOY, THAT GUARD OUT FRONT, THAT'S A TOUCHDOWN IF HE DECIDES TO PULL IT. AL: THIRD AND GOAL. KEEP IT ON THE GROUND. AND DOES HE GET IN? YES WITH THAT SECOND EFFORT. CHARBONNET HIT BY THOMPSON. LOOKED LIKE HE HAD HIM STOPPED FOR A SECOND. FIRST FORWARD. AL: MAX MELTON, THE CORNER GOT INVOLVED. THAT'S 16. THAT'S THE GUY THAT REALLY WATCH 16 BANG, RIGHT THERE. DOESN'T WRAP UP. THAT ALLOWS CHARBONNET TO KEEP MOVING HIS FEET. IT'S GOOD TO SEE CHARBONNET BACK HEALTHY. AND THAT TIME USING THE POWER TO GET OVER THE TOP OF THAT CORNER FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. AL: INTERESTING TOO. WALKER DIDN'T PLAY ON THIS DRIVE. HE HASN'T PLAYED SINCE THAT PENALTY. KIRK: YEP. AL: CHARBONNET DOES THE HEAVY LIFTING. EXTRA POINT FOR JASON MYERS. IT'S GOOD. 61 SECONDS REMAINING IN THE OPENING HALF, SEATTLE EXTENDS THE LEAD TO 14-3. REFLECTIVE OF THEIR HISTORY AND COMMUNITY AGAINST THEIR DIVISION RIVALS. CAN YOU SEE ARIZONA'S INSPIRATION, GUYS? THE COLORS OF THE DESERT. WE'LL SEE IT WEEK 16 AGAINST AGAINST THE RAMS. AL: A PRETTY GOOD COOL. TURN TO THE 27 RIGHT HERE. KIRK: THIS WILL BE SOMETHING THAT THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR WON'T LIKE. HE WAS UPSET WITH SOMETHING DURING TIME-OUT ABOUT THREE PLAYS EARLIER. HERE JUST A LOW -- JUST NOT HUSTLING TO FINISH THE PLAY. IF HE FINISHES ON THAT PLAY, HE'S PROBABLY ABLE TO -- BECAUSE OF THE EFFORT BY MELTON, 16, HE'S PROBABLY IF HE HUSTLES HERE DOESN'T GIVE UP ON IT RIGHT HERE. KEEP COMING. KEEP COMING. NOW YOU COULD GET THERE. WITH YOUR SIZE AND STRENGTH PULL HIM BACK. THERE'S CAMPBELL, TWO VETS THERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO START PLAYING BETTER AS A GROUP. AL: TIME FOR NO SWEAT. [LAUGHTER] MURRAY OVER THE MIDDLE. AND IT'S ALMOST PICKED. THAT'S ON JEWEL -- THAT TIME JULIAN LOVE IS THERE. ALMOST ANOTHER INTERCEPTION. KIRK: THESE SAFETIES DON'T FEEL ANY THREAT DOWNFIELD. BECAUSE OF THAT YOU'RE SEEING LOVE WHO IS THINKING I'VE GOT 85. WHICH WAY IS HE GOING TO GO? NOW I'M GOING TO JUMP IT. HE'S NOT WORRIED ABOUTING IN THAT'S GOING TO GO BY HIM. HE'S NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE RECEIVERS. THEY'RE PLAYING TIGHT AND THEY'RE ANTICIPATING THROWS. AND MURRAY CAUGHT A BREAK THERE. AL: SECOND AND 10. FOR-MAN RUSH TO THE OUTSIDE. THAT ONE IS SHORT TOO. THEY PUT THE HEAT ON. WELL, CROWD IS VERY FRUSTRATED -- BY THE WAY IF YOU FOLLOW FOOTBALL, YOU NOMAR VIN HARRISON IS THE SON OF MARVIN HARRISON WHO CAUGHT 900 SOME ODD PASSES FROM PEYTON MANNING ALONE. KIRK: OBVIOUS WILL, A BRILLIANT CAREER. AND HIS SON IS VERY DIFFERENTLY BUILT, DIFFERENT STYLE BUT ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HE AND HIS CORNERBACK NOT ON THE SAME PAGE. AL: A LOT OF EXAMPLE UNLESS THE LAST FOUR GAMES. THIRD AND 10. DORTCH. DORTCH PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN. SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO PUNT IT BACK HERE. TAKE A TIME-OUT. FIRST DOWN AND 10. BUT THEY'RE ON 37. AL: SO NEXT WEEKER, WE'RE GOING TO S 3-0 TEAMS BEFORE WE SEE THEM ON THURSDAY NIGHT NEXT WEEK. KIRK: DHANI JONES, RIGHT? GETTING IT DONE. AL: MURRAY SACKED. BACK AT THE 30-YARD LINE. LEONARD WILLIAMS. KIRK: THIS DEFENSIVE FRONT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT THROUGHOUT THE BROADCAST. YOU DON'T HAVE TIME BECAUSE THEY'RE ONLY RUSHING FOUR. THEY DON'T HAVE TO BLITZ. THEY'RE PLAYING ZONE. AND THEN THE PRESSURE GETS TO YOU. AL: SECOND AND 17. FULL STOP AT THE 36-YARD LINE. THEY HAVE A TIME-OUT. BUT NOT USING IT. AND THE BOOS WILL RAIN DOWN. REFEREE: TIME-OUT, ARIZONA. AL: NOW THEY CALLED A TIME-OUT WITH TWO SECONDS? OK. NOW WHAT? KIRK: NOW WHAT? I THINK A HAIL MARY AND HOPE FOR A PASS INTERFERENCE CALL. AL: HAIL MARY, A COUPLE OF LATERALS. KIRK: THEY KNEW COMING IN TONIGHT WITHOUT JAMES CORNER EVEN WITH JAMES CONNER, THAT IS REALLY GOOD DEFENSE. MIKE MCDONALD HAS A GROUP THAT UNDERSTANDS HIS SCHEME. THEY UNDERSTAND THE ATTACK. HERE'S THE DIVISIONAL RECORDS, THE NINE STILL UNDEFEATED WITH A BUNCH OF TWO AND ONES. BUT WHEN YOU CAN GET PRESSURE WITH FOUR, THE DEFENSE UNDERSTANDS EXACTLY WHAT TO DO. THEY CAN KEEP EYES ON A QUARTERBACK. AND YOU CAN'T RUN THE BALL. TIME-OUT, SEATTLE. THAT'S THE SECOND OF THE HALF. 30 SECONDS. AL: THERE'S NO QUESTION SEATTLE'S GOT A REALLY TOP GRADE DEFENSE. ARIZONA, MINE, THAT LOSS OF CONNER IS NOT ONLY BIG ON THE FIELD. IT IS VERY BIG IN THAT LOCKER ROOM. KIRK: THE LEADERSHIP. YOU'RE TAKING THE ALPHA OFF OF THE OFFENSE, THE GUY THAT EVERYBODY -- THEY FED THEIR OFFENSE THROUGH HIM AND THEY FED OFF OF HIS ENERGY. SO KYLER MURRAY BECOMES -- YOU KNOW, IT'S HIS OFFENSE BUT NOW IT REALLY BECOMES HIM. AND WHEN YOU HAVE A YOUNG SUPERSTAR RECEIVER THAT IS STRUGGLING, YOU'RE TRYING TO -- WHO TEASE GUY OTHER THAN THE TIGHT END MCBRIDE THAT CAN HELP YOU CONSISTENTLY MAKE PLAYS? IT MAKES IT PRETTY TOUGH. AL: BARRING A DEFENSIVE FOUL, THIS WILL END THE HALF HERE. TWO-MAN RUSH. NOW YOU'VE GOT MICHAEL WILSON. TO NO AVAIL. RYLAND AND TO YOUNG. AND OFF WE GO, THIRD QUARTER. YOUNG BRINGS THAT OUT TO THE 33. MOMENTS AGO, KAYLEE ON THE FIELD WITH MIKE MCDONALD. KAYLEE: MIKE, WHAT HAS YOUR DENSE DONE BEST TO KEEP THE CARDINALS' OFFENSE OUT OF RHYTHM RHYTHM? EVERY WE'RE COMMUNICATING ON ONE I COURT. LET'S GET THE BALL NOW WHEN IT'S IN OUR HANDS. KAYLEE: HOW DO YOU KEEP THAT MOMENTUM GOING? IT'S A BIG SERIES FOR US. IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO STEP ON THE GAS. KAYLEE: THANKS, MIKE. THANK YOU. AL: KENNETH WALKER IS RUN THING BACK. HE'S BACK IN. CHARBONNET DID ALL OF THE HEAVY LIFTING ON THE TOUCHDOWN DRIVE. THE FAKE, LOOK OUT FROM BEHIND. BALL IS OUT. BUT THE HAWKS ARE LIGHT THERE TO RECOVER IT. SO DARNOLD GOT CLIPPED FROM BEHIND BY JOSH SWEAT. KIRK: WE TALKED ABOUT HIM. IF HE FINISHED THE PLAY MAYBE HE KEEPS CHARBONNET OUT OF THE END ZONE. BUT HERE, THIS IS WHAT HE'S KNOWN FOR TO BE ABLE TO USE THOSE HANDS. FINISH ON THE PLAY USING THAT RIGHT CLUB TO KNOCK THE BALL AWAY. CARDS HAD THEIR CHANCE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEEDED. BUT A GOOD HEADS-UP PLAY BY BARNER TO GET THAT BALL BECAME. AL: SAW THE BETTER WITH THE RECOVERY SECOND DOWN AND 11 NOW. SMITH I NJIGBA. HE HASN'T CAUGHT THE PASS. CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN. KIRK: WE WERE TALK AT HALFTIME. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ANY MORE THE SECOND. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT IS WE'RE SURPRISED THEY'RE UP 14-3. AND THEIR TOP RECEIVER HAS NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET HIS HANDS ON THE BALL UNTIL THAT. THAT'S ONE WAY. INSTEAD OF FORCING THE BALL INTO THE COVERAGE THAT'S VERY COMPLEX AND COMPLICATED. AND THAT REALLY DETERMINED TO TAKE HIM AWAY IN THIS GAME. JUST PITCH IT TO HIM AND LET HIM MAKE SOME POSITIVE YARDS. AL: THIRD DOWN, 1. CHARBONNET IS THE BACK. ROLLING AGAINST GRAIN. THROWS ACROSS HIS BODY. AND THAT'S A FIRST DOWN. A.J. BARNER SCORED A TOUCHDOWN IN THE FIRST HALF. MAKES THAT CATCH. KIRK: AND NOW WE'LL LOOK AT OUR NEXT GEN STATS POWERED BY A.W.S. TALK ABOUT HOW THEY REALLY DONE A GOOD JOB OF SQUEEZING WHIM LEVERAGE. HE'S THE FOCAL POINT INSIDE AND OUTSIDE. ANYTHING THEY COULD DO TO TAKE HIM AWAY. IN THIS CASE, YOU TAKE HIM AWAY. WATCH NUMBER 27. HE'S GOING TO SLIDE OUTSIDE WITH HIM. THEN THE TIGHT END RELEASES. SO THE DEFENSE IS SO COGNIZANT OF WHAT HE'S DOING, IT OPENS UP OTHER OPTIONS. AL: FIRST DOWN. CHASE. RIGHT INTO THE ARIZONA BENCH. SECOND AND 8. KIRK: I BET NOBODY ON THIS TEAM FEELS MORE UPSET THAN WALKER. SOMETHING YOU JUST DON'T SEE HIM LOSING -- I WATCHED HIM AT MICHIGAN STATE. BEFORE THAT HE WAS AT WAKE FOREST. I NEVER IN MY LIFE HAD WATCHED HIM PLAY WHERE HE GOT -- A GUY GRAND HIS FOOT IN THE FIRST HALF AS HE MISSED IT. THE FIELD GOAL RANGE WAS GOING TO BE ABOUT A THIRD AND 2. AND HE THREW THE BALL AT HIM. IT COST HIM. AND NOW THEY'RE OUT OF FIELD GOAL RANGE. I'M SURE HE WANTS TO MAKE UP FOR THAT AT SOME POINT TONIGHT. AL: WALKER, NINE CARRIES FOR 48 YARDS TO THIS POINT. SECOND DOWN AND 8. TO THE OUTSIDE. COUPLE OF YARDS SHY OF THE FIRST DOWN. BARNER, HE MAKES THE CATCH HERE. BE THIRD DOWN AND 2 FOR THE SEAHAWKS. KIRK: LET'S JUST NOT TAKE FOR GRANTED SAM DARNOLD AND WHERE HE WAS IN HIS CAREER IN NEW YORK AND CAROLINA WHERE FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES, A LOT OF FOLKS IN THE LEAGUE LOOKED AT HIM AS DAMAGED GOODS. HE'S DONE. HE TALKED THIS WEEK WITH AL AND KAYLEE AND I ABOUT HIS STOP IN SAN FRANCISCO. OF COURSE, KYLE SHANAHAN. BROCK PURDY, THE YOUNGER QUARTERBACK HE POINTS TO AS A GUY WHO HAS HELPED HIM TURN HIS CAREER AROUND. AL: FIRST TIME I HEARD WHERE A YOUNGER GUY AFTER CHARBONNET PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN. WE'RE AUGUSTST ALWAYS TALKING TO THE QUARTERBACKS WORKS IS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL? IT'S ALWAYS AN OLDER COACH. YOU CAN GO BACK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, BROCK PURDY. AND HE SAID HE HELPED ME LEARN WHAT IT TAKES IN PAYING ATTENTION TO DETAIL IN PREPARATION. AND THEN HE GOES TO -- TO K.O. IN MINNESOTA. WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THAT. HE'S RESURRECTED. HE'S CONFIDENT. AND NOW KUBIAK HAS HIM PLAYING IN RHYTHM WHEN HE'S IN PLAY ACTION. AL: DOWN HE GOES AT THE 40-YARD LINE. THE ONE THING ABOUT DARNOLD IS THERE'S SUCH A PARALLEL HERE. WITH HIM AND WITH BAKER MAYFIELD. THAT'S DARIUS ROBINSON WHO CELEBRATES AT THE MOMENT. DARNOLD -- AN INJURED CARDINAL DOWN ON ONE KNEE HERE. SO THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE BREAK. GO BACK TO THE Q.B. CLASS IN 20 DOWN TO THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES AN IT'S BEEN BAKER MAYFIELD NEEDING TO MAKE A PLAY, AND HE'S MAKING THESE PLACE. SO YEAH, HE AND DARNOLD, GREAT EXAMPLES OF GOING THROUGH SOME REALLY TOUGH TIMES AND COMING OUT ON THE OTHER END BETTER FOR IT. AL: DARNOLD THIRD AND 11 HERE. EARLY THIRD QUARTER. SEAHAWKS UP 14-3. PLAY CLOCK AT THREE. FOURTH AND ONE, MAYBE. KIRK: ACTUALLY THE KICKER IS COMING OUT. I THINK THEY ARE STILL LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE. THE 10-POINT SWING. THE TOUCHDOWN BEFORE THE HALF. HE JUST SAID TO KAYLEE HOW IMPORTANT THIS SERIES IS. INSTEAD OF RISKING IT, GET THE THREE-POINT POINTS. LOOK AT A 10-POINT SWING. AL: 34-YARD ATTEMPT FROM ONE OF THE BEST IN THE LEAGUE, JASON MYERS. MYERS' KICK IS GOOD WITH 8:56 LEFT IN THIRD. SEAHAWKS TRYING TO GET TO 3-1. THE HOME OF THE COYOTES. NOW UTAH. HERE COMES DORTCH. TO THE 35-YARD LINE. KIRK: IF YOU'RE A CARDINALS FAN, YOU HAVE TO BE ASKING YOURSELF WHEN IS KYLER MURRAY GOING TO GET ON THE SAME PAGE. WE SAW THE BIG DROP. NOT ONLY ARE THEY NOT IN SYNC, MARVIN HARRISON IS NOT PLAYING WITH THE CONFIDENCE THAT YOU EXPECT HIM TO PLAY WITH. TWO INTERCEPTIONS TONIGHT. THROWN SIX TARGETING HARRISON OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. THE FOURTH MOST WHEN A QUARTERBACK TARGETS ONE RECEIVER. HE IS TRYING TO GET HIM THE BALL. I THINK IT HAS TO BE FRUSTRATING FOR THE QUARTERBACK, ESPECIALLY FRUSTRATING FOR THE RECEIVER WHO HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL. AL: COULD BE THE NEXT LARRY FITZGERALD. KIRK: FOURTH PICK OVERALL, YOU HAD BETTER BE. AL: IF YOU WANT TO BET HE WILL GET IN ON THE FIRST BALLOT, YOU BET $1,000 TO WIN $1. KIRK: THAT'S A LOCK. AL: SECOND DOWN AND EIGHT. DEEP DOWNFIELD. MICHAEL WILSON TRYING TO FIND IT. AS HE WAS THROWING DOWNFIELD. HE WAS INTERFERED WITH. BIG BREAK HERE COMING UP FOR THE CARDINALS. KIRK: I LOVE TO SEE THEY ARE TRYING TO STRETCH THE DEFENSE. THERE HAVE NOT BEEN A LOT OF SHOTS DOWNFIELD THAT HAVE HAD ANY SUCCESS. HERE THEY GET THE INTERFERENCE. REFEREE: PASS INTERFERENCE. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. AL: HERE'S THE -- KIRK: GRABS THE ARM RIGHT THERE. OBVIOUSLY IMPACTS WILSON FROM TRYING TO GET TO HIS SPOT ON THAT FADE. AL: HARRISON, YOU TALK, AGAIN, SOMETIMES YOU THINK TOO MUCH. IT IS PARALYSIS BY ANALYSIS. KIRK: I THINK ANYTHING, ABOUT CONFIDENCE, FEELING GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF. HE HAD AN ABUNDANCE OF THAT AT OHIO STATE IN COLLEGE. HE KNEW HE WAS THE BEST PLAYER ON THE FIELD. LITTLE THINGS LIKE THE WAY HE COMES OFF THE BALL AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, THE WAY HE RUNS A ROUT. IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A GUY THAT AT TIMES, I WAS WATCHING FILM THIS WEEK COMING INTO THIS GAME. I THOUGHT IS HE HURT? HE JUST DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A GUY THAT IS PLAYING -- AND THEY CHALLENGED HIM THIS YEAR. THEY WANTED HIM TO PLAY 1,000 MILES AN HOUR. PLAY PHYSICAL WITH THAT SIZE. AL: SECOND AND EIGHT. FLAG IS THROWN HERE. KIRK: A HOLD BY THE LEFT TACKLE, HARRIS JOHNSON. REFEREE: HOLDING, OFFENSE NUMBER 70. 10-YARD PENALTY. SECOND DOWN. AL: JOHNSON THEIR TOP TICK PICK OUT OF OHIO STATE. THIRD YEAR IN THE LEAGUE. KIRK: HE IS COMING OFF AN INJURY, MISSED THE LAST WEEK. IT IS ALL ABOUT HIS FEET. WHEN HIS FEET ARE IN POSITION, HE IS ABLE TO BE LIKE ANY TACKLE THAT GETS OUT THERE ISOLATED AGAINST A REALLY GOOD EDGE PASSED RUSHER. THAT LEFT ARM GETS UP AROUND THE NECK RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE REFEREE. AL: BACK TO A SECOND AND 17. BACK AT THEIR OWN 44-YARD-LINE. MURRAY. DROPS IT UNDERNEATH. BENSON. THOMAS WITH THE TACKLE. KAYLEE: SEATTLE'S DEFENSIVE LINE IS NOT GETTING DEMARCUS LAWRENCE BACK TONIGHT. HE CAME OUT IN SWEATS. HE GAVE ME A NOD. HE SAID I'M OK. IT IS THE QUAD. IT COMES WITH THE TERRITORY. NWOSU GETTING HEALTHIER. HELPS HIM GET SOME DEPTH THERE. AL: IT WILL BE THE NEXT GAME AGAINST TAMPA BAY. MURRAY GETTING CHASED. MURRAY HAS TO FOURTH DOWN. BOOST ARE BOOKINGS ARE RAINING-- BOOS ARE RAINING DOWN. KIRK: THIS IS A COMBINATION. AN OFFENSE THAT IS REELING. THEY ARE NOT SEEING THE YOUNG RECEIVER MAKING PLAYS. NOT IN SYNC. YOU HAVE A FRUSTRATED QUARTERBACK. MAKE NO MISTAKE. THIS IS A COMBINATION OF AN OFFENSE TRYING TO FIND ITSELF IN A REALLY, REALLY REALLY GOOD SEATTLE DEFENSE. AL: BLAKE GILLIKIN, THIS WILL BE HIS FOURTH PUNT. FIRST THREE HAVE AVERAGED 54 YARDS. FAIR CATCH CALLED FOR HERE. AT THE 13-YARD LINE. 6 1/2 REMAINING IN COACH GENO SMITH. KIRK: GENO SMITH OPTS TO GO TO LAS VEGAS TO BE REUNITED WITH PETE CARROLL. THEY ANNOUNCE, LET'S GO GET SAM DARNOLD. AL: THEY MADE SMITH AN OFFER. HE DIDN'T LIKE IT. WENT TO NEVADA. SECOND DOWN. RICHARD: KIND OF CRAZY. YOU BRING A COORDINATOR IN TO WORK WITH ONE GUY AND HE WINDS UP WORKING WITH ANOTHER GUY. THERE IS JOHN SCHNEIDER, THE LONG TIME GENERAL MANAGER OF THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS. KIRK: IT IS FUNNY. I LOVE HOW QUICKLY THEY HAD TO RESPOND GOING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. THEY ANNOUNCED WHO IS OUT THERE THAT FITS WHAT WE WANT TO DO. THE YEAR SAM DARNOLD HAD IN MINNESOTA. THEY SAID THAT'S OUR GUY. HE FITS OUR SYSTEM. LET'S GO PAY HIM AND MOVE ON. AL: SO FAR, SO GOOD, SECOND AND 11. TO THE OUTSIDE. COOPER KUPP, NOWHERE TO GO. KIRK: PRETTY REMARKABLE TO THINK ABOUT FIVE TEAMS THAT HE STARTS WITH. THE GUY IS 28 YEARS OLD. THINK ABOUT WHAT HE HAS BEEN THROUGH AND HIS ONLY 28 YEARS OLD. IN HIS EIGHTH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE. THINK ABOUT WHAT'S AHEAD OF HIM. AL: FROM THE GREAT TRADITION OF U.S.C. QUARTERBACKS. HE IS 28. TALKING ABOUT THE PARALLEL, BAKER MAYFIELD. HE IS 30, TWO YEARS OLDER. BOOM, FIRES. INCOMPLETE. THE ARIZONA DEFENSE -- KIRK: WE SAW TWO CORNERS OF THIS SERIES MAKE BIG PLAYS. KEY TERRELL AND THISKEI TREL. COOPER KUPP THINKING THAT BALL MAY COME OUT AND GREAT PLAY. GREAT SERIES BY THE CARDINALS DEFENSE TO GET THE BALL BACK. AL: HERE IS DICKSON'S HYUNDAI. KIRK: WE TALKED ABOUT THE SEATTLE DEFENSE AND HOW DOMINANT THIS FRONT CAN BE. WE HAVE SEEN THAT ON DISPLAY. GOOD JOB OF PLAYING ZONE. KEEPING THE EYES ON THE FOOTBALL. PRESSURE ON THAT LAST SERIES GETTING THE CARDINALS OFF THE FIELD. MIKE MACDONALD IN HIS SECOND YEAR AS A HEAD COACH, SECOND YEAR CALLING THIS DEFENSE. MUCH MORE FAMILIAR WITH WHAT HIS GUYS CAN DO. THEY ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE SCHEME. HIS DEFENSE IS PLAYING AS FAST AND CONNECTED AS ANY DEFENSE IN THE NFL. AL: THE OFFENSE HAS GAINED ONLY 115 YARDS TO THIS POINT. MCBRIDE MAKES THAT CATCH. THIS WILL BE COMING UP THE 39TH PLAY OF THE NIGHT. ARIZONA 17 YARDS. KIRK: YOU LOOK AT THIS, SEVEN OF THE 16 COMPLETION HAVE BEEN BEHIND THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. ONLY THROWN IT TWICE OVER 20 YARDS. WE KNEW IT COMING G IN. THEY TALKED ABOUT IT BEING A SPACE GAME GET OUR GUYS IN SPACE AND MAKE PEOPLE MISS WITH SOME YARD A.F.C. THE CATCH. IT HAS JUST BEEN TOUGH SLEDDING AGAINST THIS DEFENSE. AL: SECOND AND SIX. TO THE OUTSIDE. THAT IS A FIRST DOWN. TREY BENSON COMING OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. FOUR MINUTES TO GO IN THE THIRD. KIRK: HE HAS BEEN DOING IT ALL GAME. SITTING BACK WITH THE SAFETIES. ALLOWING THE FRONT FOUR TO CREATE THE PRESSURE. YOU HAVE FIVE GUYS UNDERNEATH WAITING TO MAKE BIG TACKLES. AL: TO THE SIDELINE. THAT IS GOING TO BE HARRISON. KIRK: HOW ABOUT THE BALL BY MURRAY? ADJUSTING BACK TO THE BALL. NEVER REALLY SEES THAT. HE IS IN PRETTY GOOD POSITION. JUST DOESN'T GET HIS HEAD TURNED AROUND UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE. GOOD AWARENESS IN THE FOOTWORK THERE BY HARRISON FOR A POSITIVE GAIN. AL: THE FIRST OFFENSIVE PLAY OF THE NIGHT. SECOND GRAB LEER. FROM THE 32. FLEA FLICKER. LOOK OUT. THAT DIDN'T FOOL ANYBODY. TWO HAWKS CAME IN WITH JOSH JOBE TO TAKE HIM DOWN. KIRK: COULD NOT HAVE COME AT A WORSE TIME. THEY BROUGHT THE ALL-OUT BLITZ ON THE EDGE. WITHERSPOON HERE. JOBE HERE ON THE OTHER SIDE. JOBE DOESN'T GIVE UP ON IT. WITHERSPOON IS THERE AS WELL. GOOD JOB KEEPING THEIR EYES ON THE FOOTBALL. KNEW EXACTLY WHERE THEY NEEDED TO GO TO TAKE MURRAY DOWN. NOT FOOLED AT ALL. A LITTLE RAZZLE-DAZZLE THERE ON FIRST AND 10. AL: SEVEN-YARD LOSS. SECOND DOWN AND 17. A FOUR-MAN RUSH, A BIG RUSH. MURRAY SIGNALS DOWNFIELD AND -- BACK TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. THIRD DOWN AND ONE. KIRK: ONE OF THE THINGS WITH MURRAY, ESPECIALLY AGAINST A FRONT THAT CAN GET IN AND PENETRATE THIS QUICKLY. WHEN HE GETS OUT, HE NEEDS HELP. LET'S SEE HOW THE RECEIVERS DO HERE. RIGHT NOW JOWRKS TO RESPOND. IF ANYBODY WORKS WITH HIM, NOT REALLY UNTIL MARVIN HARRISON TURNED DOWNFIELD. THEY HAD TWO DEFENDERS ON HIM. NOWHERE TO GO WITH THE FOOTBALL TONIGHT. IT IS A COMBINATION OF GOOD COVERAGE DOWNFIELD. STICKY BUT ALSO THE RECEIVERS HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB TRYING TO FIND SOME SPACE. AL: IT JUST GOES ON AND ON. THIS TIME IT IS DORTCH. KIRK: THIRD AND 17. TRYING TO GET THAT SCREEN SET UP. EVEN IF HE CATCHES THAT, THIS IS A TWO OR THREE-YARD GAIN. THIS DEFENSE PLAYS TOO WELL AS A UNIT TO THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP ENOUGH YARDS TO GET A FIELD GOAL. STHER STILL GOING TO BRING HIM OUT. AL: 57-YARD ATTEMPT HERE. MISSED THE 57 YARDER LAST WEEK. THIS TIME FROM 57. THE KICK IS GOOD! AT LEASTIT IS -- AN 11-POINT GAME. KIRK: THE QUESTION WE ALL HAD BETWEEN MARVIN HARRISON AND THE OTHER WHO IS GOING TO HELP THEM OUT, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO SCRAMBLING AND MAKING PLAYS. HE IS GOING TO BE UNDER A A LOT OF DURESS AND LOOKING TO KEEP PLAYS ALIVE. NOBODY IS REALLY TRYING TO PLAY WITH SOME URGENCY OUT AT THAT WIDE RECEIVER POSITION. IT IS ALMOST LIKE I'M SUPPOSED TO RUN TO THIS POINT. I'M RUNNING MY ROUT. THEY TURN AROUND AND MURRAY IS RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE. BY THE TIME THEY TO REACT, HE IS OUT OF BOUNDS OR DOWN FOR THE PRESSURE. AL: CAME INTO THIS GAME ONLY 1/3 OF THE PASS COMPLETIONS FROM MURRAY WENT TO WIDE-OUTS. TONIGHT HE HAS COMPLETED 18, ALMOST ALL OF THEM SHORT PASSES. ONLY SEVEN HAVE GONE WIDE-OUTS. RUNNING BACKS. 17-6. 57 YARDER. SOME ROOM. BACK AT THE 33 YARD-LINE. A MINUTE AND A HALF TO THE END OF THE THIRD. KIRK: ONE THING YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IS THE CARDINAL IT IS DEFENSE COMING OUT AND PLAYING WITH SOME ENERGY. THESE GUYS FLYING AROUND. ONE OF THE MORE COMPLICATED SCHEMES THAT YOU'LL SEE. YOU SIT THERE AND WATCH FILM. YOU'RE REWINDING IT, SECOND TIME, THIRD TIME, FOURTH TIME. THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR CALLS THE DEFENSE. THEY DO A GREAT JOB. THEY GET A LOT OF HYBRID PLAYERS. GUYS THAT CAN DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS WHICH CREATES CONFUSION. YOU HAVE A HARD TIME I.D.ING BUDDA BAKER AND WHAT HIS JOB MIGHT BE POST SNAP. IT PUTS A ON THE QUARTERBACK FROM PRETO POST SNAP. THESE GUYS PLAY WITH FIRE DESPITE BEING DOWN IN THIS GAME, DOWN 11. AL: PRETTY MUCH, SIRIANNI WAS THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR IN PHILADELPHIA FOR TWO YEARS. HE GETS THE JOB. HE KNOWS HE HAS GOT THE JOB. A LITTLE BIT OF TAMPERING INVOLVED TOO. THEY TALKED TO HIM BEFORE THE SUPER BOWL. THE INTERESTING THING WAS HE COMES IN, THE MOST EXCITING DAY OF YOUR PROFESSIONAL LIFE. HE COMES IN AFTER GIVING P 38 POINTS TO KANSAS CITY IN THE SUPER BOWL IN THIS STADIUM. KIRK: TOUGH ONE. YOU BROUGHT UP ANOTHER ONE. KYLE SHANAHAN. HE TAKES THE JOB. AL: PREORDAINED. SECOND AND SIX. THAT IS IN COMPLETE. KIRK: THAT IS THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE TARGETED HIM. PART OF THIS DEFENSE. THEY CAN DO SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. THE FIRST THING THINK THINK ABOUT IS THIS DEFENSIVE -- WHAT DO THEY DO WELL? WHAT DO WE WANT TO TRY TO TAKE AWAY? IS IT THE SCHEME? IS IT A PLAYER? TONIGHT IT'S BEEN LET'S TAKE AWAY J. SMRVETION AND MAKE THEM BEAT US IN OTHER AREAS. FOR THE SEAHAWKS, THEY PUT 17 POINTS UP BUT IT HAS BEEN A QUIET NIGHT FOR NUMBER 11. AL: TO THE OUTSIDE. FIRST DOWN. KIRK: THEY BROUGHT THE HEAT THERE. THEY DIALED IT UP. SAM DARNOLD KNOWS HE HAS TO BEAT BUDDA BAKER. GET IT OUT BEFORE BUDDA BAKER GETS IN THERE AND KEEP YOUR FOCUS AND RHYTHM DOWNFIELD. GIVING NUMBER 11 AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET A CATCH. A HECK OF A JOB CONCENTRATING. AL: DARNOLD 13 COMPLETION TO EIGHT DIFFERENT RECEIVERS. WALKER. A LOSS. THAT IS GOING TO TAKE US TO THE END OF PERIOD NUMBER THREE. ON TO THE FOURTH. IN ARIZONA. THE SEATTLE KIRK: CAST OF THOUSANDS. AL: THERE YOU GO. CAST OF THOUSANDS. SECOND DOWN AND 15. TO THE OUTSIDE. THIRD DOWN. KIRK: SEEING A CONSISTENT PUSH UPFRONT FROM THIS DEFENSIVE LINE. THAT TIME IT WAS JORDAN BURCH, THE ROOKIE OUT OF OREGON. AL: STEPPINGS AWAY. FLAG IS THROWN ON THE NEAR SIDE OF THE FIELD. OUT OF BOUNDS. KIRK: GOING TO BE DEFENSIVE HOLDING ON JALEN THOMPSON. DEFENDING COOPER KUPP. REFEREE: THE QUARTERBACK HAD THE BALL. HOLDING, DEFENSIVE NUMBER 34. FIVE-YARD PENALTY. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. KIRK: THEY GOT HIM AT THIRD DOWN. HAD A CHANCE TO GET OFF THE FIELD. TIGHTENED UP. PLAYED MAN. PRETTY TOUGH ASK OF ANYBODY. HE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT THE HECK COWL I DO, LOOKING UP AT THE BIG SCREEN. LOSING HIS BALANCE GOING TO THE GROUND. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. SAM DARNOLD NOT IN ANY HURRY AT ALL. AL: UNDER 70 YARDS TONIGHT. AVERAGING EIGHT YARDS PER CATCH. A DECENT NUMBER. SECOND AND 10. KIRK: CAN'T HELP BUT BE OPTIMISTIC IF YOU'RE THE CARDINALS. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS. THE BALL IS DROPPED. IF YOU DON'T GIVE UP A TOUCHDOWN HERE AND YOU HOLD THEM TO A FIELD GOAL, I KNOW YOU HAVE TO SCORE TOUCHDOWNS EVENTUALLY BUT AT LEAST IT STAYS IN A TWO-POSSESSION GAME. THEY ARE ROTATING A LOT OF BODIES, TRYING TO STAY FRESH ON THAT DEFENSIVE FRONT WHERE THEY HAVE SOME DEPTH BUT THEY ARE THINKING AT THE VERY LEAST, THEY HAVE GOT TO HOLD THEM TO A FIELD GOAL. AL: FIRES. HAD THE FIRST DOWN -- AN 11-YARD GAIN IS TURNED INTO A NINE AND BROUGHT BACK TO THE 11. FIRST DOWN. KIRK: HE REALLY HAS TO FEEL THIS DEFENDER AND TRY TO NEGOTIATE. YEP, TOOK THE TIGHT END. NO PROBLEM. GOT THE ANSWER. YOU SEE JACKSON SMITH JAXON SMITH-NJIGBA GET BACK TO THE FOOTBALL AND HAVE ENOUGH YARDAGE HERE FOR THAT FIRST DOWN. SAM DARNOLD AGAIN WITH THE FOOTWORK THAT HE HAS. JUST GREAT RHYTHM. AL: WALKER. A PICK UP OF FOUR. KIRK: I THINK THE WORD THAT STICK OUT IF YOU'RE WATCHING DARNOLD IS THE EFFICIENCY WHICH WE SAW A LOT OF UNTIL THE PLAYOFF GAME AGAINST THE RAMS WHERE THEY SACKED HIM NINE TIMES. IT WAS A ROUGH DAY FOR HIM AND THEIR WHOLE OFFENSE. 15-21 TONIGHT. YOU MENTIONED THE YARDAGE. IT IS OK. NO INTERCEPTIONS. IN COMMAND. NOT MAKING MISTAKES. EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT WHEN YOU HAVE THE KIND OF DEFENSE THAT THIS SEAHAWKS TEAM HAS. AL: WALKER AGAIN. WALKER BUSTS LOOSE! WALKER INSIDE THE 10-YARD LINE. IT WILL BE FIRST AND GOAL FOR THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS. KIRK: WHAT I LOVE HERE IS THEY MIX A LOT OF DIFFERENT PERSONNEL. THIS IS OLD SCHOOL, OLD SCHOOL ISO HERE. FOLLOW THE FULLBACK THROUGH NO HOLE. USE YOUR VISION. HE DOES NOT BLINK. IT IS A QUICK REACTION WITH THE VISION THAT HE HAS AND THEN HE HAS THE ACCELERATION TO FIND EXACTLY WHERE HE NEEDED TO GO, GETS BEHIND 72, ABRAHAM LUCAS, THE RIGHT TACKLE. GOOD RUNNING. HE IS LIABLETO GO ANYWHERE. AL: CHARBONNET AGAIN. CHARBONNET TO THE END ZONE. TOUCHDOWN. FLAG IS DOWN. KIRK: THEY GOT A HOLD HERE. I THINK ON JAXON SMITH-NJIGBA WHO DIDN'T REALLY NEED TO MAKE THE HOLD. IT WAS A TOUCHDOWN. REFEREE: 10-YARD PENALTY. KIRK: THAT'S A TOUCHDOWN. GOOD HUSTLE PLAY BUT JUST NOT NECESSARY. MAX MILTON WAS TRYING TO COME UP. AND HE GRABS HIM. LOOKS LIKE HE REACHES AROUND AND PULLS HIM ON TOP. GOOD CALL FOR HOLDING. AL: GOOD CALL BY ALEX. ONE THING WHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING IN AN OPEN MIC BUT IF THE MIC'S NOT OPEN, YOU GET AWAY WITH IT. KIRK: GAVE HIM A LOOK. AL: OH, YEAH. KIRK: MY KIDS, WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER, I USED TO GIVE THEM THIS LOOK RIGHT HERE. AL: BEAUTIFUL. JUST A MISDEMEANOR THIS TIME. THOMPSON. BACK TO THE SIDELINE. KIRK: 11-POINT GAME. A TOUCHDOWN HERE MAKES IT OBVIOUSLY REALLY TOUGH FOR FOR A THREE-POSSESSION GAME BUT IF YOU CAN SQUEEZE DOWN HERE IN THE RED ZONE AND CATCH A BREAK THERE WITH THAT PENALTY AND SEE IF THEY CAN FORCE A FIELD GOAL AND KEEP IT A TWO-POSSESSION GAME. JACKSON SMITH NJIGBA STILL TALKING TO HIM. HE IS A PRETTY CHILL GUY. METCALF. REALLY BECOMES THE LEADER HERE. WITH COOPER KUPP ON THE SIDE. AL: FOR SURE. WALKER. TO THE 8-YARD-LINE GOES KENNETH WALKER. CLOSE TO FIVE YARDS A CARRY. DARNOLD AVERAGING CLOSE THE NINE YARDS A THROW. KIRK: ESPECIALLY IN KUBIAK'S OFFENSE. THAT IS A GREAT POINT. YOU WANT TO RUN THE BALL BUT YOU ARE ONLY AVERAGING 3.3 YARDS A CARRY. 29TH IN THE NFL. TONIGHT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET ON TRACK AND THAT PUTS SAM DARNOLD AND THIS OFFENSE IN A GREAT SPOT. THEIR PLAY-ACTION GAME. TWO TIGHT ENDS MOVED AT THE SAME TIME. REFEREE: FALSE START. OFFENSE NUMBER 81. FIVE-YARD PENALTY. SECOND DOWN. AL: SECOND DOWN AND GOAL AS THEY MOVE THIS BABY BACK NOW TO THE 13. KIRK: YOU THINK THE -- IT IS COMING UP. AL: A LITTLE HISTORY. KIRK: YOU HAVE DONE A FEW BALLGAMES. SUPER BOWLS. AL: SEATTLE-ARIZONA WAS A 6-6 TIE A FEW YEARS AGO WITH A 15-MINUTE OVERTIME. WALKER. SPINNING, NOTHING. DRIVEN ALL THE WAY BACK THAT TIME. THIRD DOWN AND GOAL. KIRK: HE WANTED TO SPIN AWAY. HERE IS CAMPBELL. THAT SPIN MOVE. HE JUMPS AWAY FROM BUDDA BAKER RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF XAVIER. AFTER THAT HOLDING CALL, THIRD AND GOAL. AGAIN, THE BIG SERIES FOR THIS DEFENSE. AL: JUST INSIDE THE 16-YARD-LINE. THIRD AND GOAL. TO THE OUTSIDE. THAT IS DEFENDED VERY WELL. COOPER KUPP GOES NOWHERE. CLARK WITH THE TACKLE. THEY WILL HAVE TO SETTLE FOR THREE. THIS WILL KEEP IT A TWO-POSSESSION LEAD. KIRK: AS BAD AS THINGS HAVE BEEN FOR THE CARDINALS OFFENSE TONIGHT. THIS DEFENSE IS FIGHTING. THEY ARE FIGHTING TO TEND. GIVING THESE GUYS AT LEAST A HOPE, SOME HOPE THAT THEY CAN STAY IN THE FOOTBALL GAME. AL: 31-YARD ATTEMPT FOR JASON MYERS. SEATTLE TAKES A 20-6 -- BUTTERFLY. 9-YARD LINE. TO THE 27. SO THE DEFENSE WE KNOW IS GOOD. FOR ARIZONA. OFFENSE, WE TALKED ABOUT MARVIN HARRISON AND ALL THE REST. WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING KYLER MURRAY FOR A LONG TIME. KIRK: UBER TALENTED. I THINK THE ONE THING THAT STANDS OUT TO ME, PLAYING THAT POSITION IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST THE PHYSICAL AT BEUTS. ITATTRIBUTES. IT IS ABOUT RAISING YOUR TEAM. GETTING THEM TO BELIEVE. LOOK AT THE GUYS IN HIS DRAFT CLASS. BAKER MAYFIELD. ALLEN. YOU WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE FROM KYLER MURRAY. YOU KNOW WHAT HE CAN DO. YOU KNOW HOW TALENTED HE IS. BUT DOES HE GIVE YOU THAT SAME FEELING OVER THESE LAST FEELINGS THAT JOSH ALLEN GIVE OR LAMAR JACKSON GIVE? ANOTHER GUY IN THAT 18 CLASS, GET YOUR GUYS TO BELIEVE. AL: A YEAR LATER. THE NEXT DRAFT. HE FINALLY TAKES OFF HERE. SHOWS HIS SPEED. DOWN THE SIDELINE HE GOES. OUT OF BOUNDS AFTER A LONG GAIN HERE. SECOND DOWN AND SEVEN, HE GOES FOR 29 YARDS. KIRK: IT IS TOUGH TO DO WHEN YOU HAVE A DEFENSE THAT IS PLAYING A LOT OF ZONE AND KEEPING THEIR EYES ON YOU. NOW HE IS ABLE TO FINALLY BE ABLE TO GET INTO A FOOTRACE THERE WITH A LINEBACKER AND RUNS AWAY FROM TYRESE TIEGHT TYRESE NIGHT. AL: MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN IN THE 18 CLASS. IN THE 18 CLASS JOSH ROSEN. HE SAID JOSH IS MY QUARTERBACK UNLESS I CAN GET MURRAY NUMBER ONE, WHICH HE DID. KIRK: HE IS AS TALENTED A GUY ATHLETICALLY AS YOU'RE GOING TO SEE. BIG ARM. HAS IT ALL. AL: SECOND AND NINE. MURPHY. STOPS HIP. THIRD DOWN AND EIGHT. KIRK: YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME RUNNING BETWEEN THE TACKLES IN THIS YEAR IF THIS DEFENSE STAYS HEALTHY. AN INTERESTING CALL THERE ON SECOND DOWN. AL: THIRD AND EIGHT. FIRED. AND THAT'S CAUGHT. MCBRIDE. KIRK: GREAT JOB THERE LOCATING. HE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE HE WANTED TO GO WITH THE BALL. HE TALKED ABOUT A WEAPON MCBRIDE HAS BEEN IN HIS OFFENSE SINCE HE CAME INTO THE LEAGUE. AT THAT TIME THEY SPLIT THE TWO MIDDLE LINEBACKERS. QUICK DECISION BY MURRAY. AL: NICE RUN HERE. TREY BENSON. BENSON TONIGHT, STARTED A TOTAL OF SEVEN TIMES. MAKE IT 8--35 NOW. KIRK: WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY GOT CLOSE TO THE RED ZONE, HOW TOUGH IT IS TO SCORE TOUCHDOWNS IN THIS AREA THIS SEAHAWKS DEFENSE. SEE IF THEY CAN DO IT. AL: SECOND AND FOUR. THE FLAG. INTERFEREING WITH XAVIER WEAVER. REFEREE: PASS INTERFERENCE NUMBER 27. FIRST DOWN. KIRK: A GOOD JOB OF ATTACKING WOOLEN. HE JUST DOESN'T DO A GOOD JOB. HE DOESN'T DO A GOOD JOB OF LOCATING THE FOOTBALL. SECOND TIME WE HAVE SEEN THAT. THEY HAVE GONE WITH THE GO BALL AND MURRAY GETS HIT RIGHT AS HE THROWS THE FOOTBALL. GOOD JOB OF FINDING THE MATCHUP THAT YOU LIKE AND GOING AFTER WOOLEN THERE WHO IS STRUGGLING WHEN THEY ATTACK DOWNFIELD. GETTING HIS HEAD TURNED AND AND STAYING IN SYNC WITH THE RECEIVER. AL: THIRD AND NINE, FIRST AND GOAL. MAKES THE SACK. THAT WOESO ISNWOSO IS THERE. KIRK: ALMOST FORCED THE BALL TO MARVIN HARRISON THERE. DIDN'T KNOW WHAT JOBE WAS GOING TO DO AS A DEFENDER. WAS HE GOING TO STAY UP OR DROP BACK? HE GETS IN THAT GRAY AREA. IS HE GOING TO STAY UP? AT THE LAST SECOND HE DECIDES TO DROP AND THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE THE PRESSURE CLOSE IN ON HIM. AL: SECOND AND GOAL. HARRISON LEFT. MURRAY. MURRAY TO THE END ZONE. HARRISON HAS IT! TOUCHDOWN! KIRK: THAT IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST A TOUCHDOWN THAT GETS YOU A -- POSSESSION. YOU CAN SEE RELIEF FROM MARVIN HARRISON AS HE TOOK A KNEE AFTER WINNING THIS BATTLE AGAINST BEST SEATTLE HAS. WITHERSPOON WHO CAN COVER THE BEST OF THEM. GREAT BALL BY KYLER MURRAY. A HECK OF A JOB BY MARVIN HARRISON. FINALLY HIGH-POINTING A BALL USING HIS STRENGTH TO COME DOWN WITH THAT FOOTBALL. AL: ONE-REGISTRATION GAME. RYSION BUT THIS WAS A MASSIVE EXHALE BY MARVIN HARRISON JR. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT CATCH AND GET THAT CONFIDENCE BACK WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE. AL: HE PULLS HIS TEAM RIGHT BACK INTO THE GAME. FIELDED AT THE GOAL LINE HERE, HOLANI. THEY HAVE TO TRY TO GET THE BALL BACK AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. KIRK: REMINDS ME OF BUFFALO AND MIAMI. FEELS LIKE IT IS A LOT BIGGER THAN A 14-POINT SPREAD. GOT IT TO SEVEN. THEIR DEFENSE KEPT THEM IN THE GAME. ARIZONA, THEIR DEFENSIVE GURU. GET IT TO WITHIN SEVEN. 5:44 TO GO. ALL THREE TIME-OUTS. LET'S SEE IF THE DEFENSE CAN STEP UP AGAIN. AL: SEEMED LIKE A LOT MORE THAN A 14-POINT LEAD, WHICH NOW IN PERIL AS THAT PASS IS INCOMPLETE AND NEARLY PICKED. SECOND DOWN. THOMPSON. WAS THERE. KIRK: THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR WAS A SUPERSTAR AND A FUTURE HEAD COACH. THEY ARE WORKING WITHOUT THEIR TOP THREE CORNERS. DERRICK WILLIAMS IS OUT. JOHNSON, THE ROOKIE. TOP THREE CORNERS OUT AND THIS DEFENSE SHOWING A LOT OF DEPTH AND FIGHT TONIGHT WITHOUT THEM. AL: SECOND DOWN. FIVE. THIRD DOWN AND SIX. KIRK: AFTER THAT INCOMPLETION. INTERESTING PLAY CALL FROM KUBIAK. AFTER YOU STOP THE CLOCK. YOU COME DOWN WITH A SECOND DOWN CALL, RUN THE FOOTBALL. DON'T GET A LOT OF YARDS AND NOW YOU'RE IN A THIRD AND SIX. WE HAVE NOT HEARD THE STADIUM THIS LOUD EXCEPT FOR THE HALFTIME PERFORMANCE THAT WE SAW SAW. YOU MISSED THAT. AL: THIRD DOWN AND SIX. DARNOLD. DEEP DOWNFIELD! REACHING SET BACK SMITH-NJIGBA! LOOKING BACK. PULLS IT IN FROM ALONG THE SIDELINE. FROM THIRD AND SIX. 36 YARDS. KIRK: WHAT A ROUT BY JAXON SMITH-NJIGBA. ABLE TO RUN AWAY FROM MAX MELTON. A HECK OF A JOB. RIGHT OVER THE OUTSIDE SHOULDER. RIGHT FOOT, LEFT FOOT, OUT OF BOUNDS. FIRST DOWN. THE CARDINALS HAVE SOME MOMENTUM. CROWD IS IN THE GAME. THIRD AND SIX. LOOK AT THE EYES FOCUSING ON THAT SAFETY. SAW HIM BITE DOWN. KNEW HE HAD IT ONE-ON-ONE TO THE OUTSIDE TO HIS BEST RECEIVER. HE HAS HAD A QUIET NIGHT AND HE MAKES THEM PAY FOR IT. AL: EIGHT DIFFERENT RECEIVERS. CALAIS CAMPBELL. A LITTLE SHAKEN UP. COMES TO THE SIDELINE NOW. SHOULDER. HE COMES OUT. THE CLOCK BEGINS TO BECOME A FACTOR HERE. HAVE TO GET A COUPLE OF FIRST DOWNS. MAKE ARIZONA USE THEIR TIME-OUTS. THEY HAVE ALL THREE. KIRK: THAT COULD BE NOT JUST THE PLAY OF THIS GAME. THAT IS A THIRD AND SIX AND NOW YOU'RE ALREADY IN POTENTIALLY FIELD GOAL RANGE. WITH YOUR TOP RECEIVER. ONE-ON-ONE. AL: WALKER. ON THE GROUND. BOUNCING. 38-YARD LINE. SECOND DOWN. KIRK: THE HOLD OF JAXON SMITH-NJIGBA ON THE WALKER TOUCHDOWN THAT PREVENTED THE HAWKS FROM GETTING THE TOUCHDOWN. HE HAS A CHANCE TO AVENGE THAT MISTAKE AND HE STEPS UP AND DOES. LOOK AT THE FIRST HALF. NOW THREE RECEPTIONS. ALMOST 20 YARDS A CATCH. AL: TAKES THIS BABY ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THREE. STOP. 37-YARD LINE. THIRD DOWN HERE. REFEREE: TIME-OUT ARIZONA. THEIR FIRST OF THE HALF. THIS WILL BE A 30-SECOND TIME-OUT. KIRK: THE BIG THING HERE IS KUBIAK. WHAT IS THE CALL. IF YOU THROW FOOTBALL, IT SHOWS THE TRUST YOU HAVE IN SAM DARNOLD. THE LAST THING YOU CAN DO HERE IS TAKE A SACK. YOU TAKE A SACK, YOU'RE IN FIELD GOAL RANGE. YOU'RE IN FIELD GOAL RANGE NOW. DO YOU RUN THE BALL LEFT TO GET IT TO THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD PICKING UP A FEW MORE YARDS? MAYBE GET IT WITHIN A 50-YARDER? AL: IN TODAY'S NFL. YOU'RE IN FIELD GOAL RANGE IF IT IS A 55-YARDER. KIRK: LOOKING AT A 54-55 YARDER RIGHT NOW. I THINK THIS TRUST THEY HAVE WITH DARNOLD, MAYBE, SEE WHAT THEY DO. THIS WILL BE INTERESTING. AL: THIRD AND NINE. KUPP MOVING OVER. ON THE GROUND. CHARBONNET. SETS UP FOURTH DOWN. SETS UP FOR MYERS TO ATTEMPT A FIELD GOAL. HO HUM. THIS IS BIG. THE CARDINALS GOT TO WITHIN A POSSESSION. 3:40 AND COUNTING. AL: IT IS GOING TO BE A 53 YARDER. MYERS TO TRY TO MAKE IT A 10-POINT GAME. UNDER 3 1/2 TO GO. AND THE KICK IS NO GOOD. THE BALL COMES BACK. KIRK: THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR OF THE ARIZONA CARDINALS. HIS CARDINALS DEFENSE, AS MUCH AS WE BRAGGED ABOUT SEATTLE, HE CAME INTO WE CAME INTO THIS GAME THINKING IT WOULD BE TWO GREAT DEFENSES COMING AT US. THEY SURE HAVE STEPPED UP. WIDE RIGHT. KYLER MURRAY PRETTY GOOD FIELD POSITION. PRETTY CLOSE TO MIDFIELD. GETS EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS WITH 3:16 TO GO. THE URGENCY THEY PLAYED WITH, IT REALLY PUT THE SEAHAWKS ON THEIR HEELS FOR THE FIRST TIME. EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO, FROM THE STRATEGIC STANDPOINT, YOU WONDER IF THEY MIGHT USE SOME OF THAT SAME URGENCY. AL: PLENTY OF TIME. 3:16. TWO TIME-OUTS. OUT THE OUT TO THE OUTSIDE HERE. OUT OF BOUNDS. NEAR MIDFIELD. KIRK: ALWAYS GOT TO FACTOR IN AS A DEFENSE, WITH MIKE MACDONALD'S CREW, YOU SAW KYLER MURRAY SCRAMBLE A COUPLE OF TIMES ON THAT LAST DRIVE. THE LAST THING HE REALLY CAN AFFORD IS TO LOSE YOUR EYES ON HIM AND LET HIM STEP UP AND PICK UP YARDS LIKE HE DID THAT LAST DRIVE. AL: SECOND AND FOUR. TO THE SIDELINE. REACHING UP. DOES HE HOLD IT IN, IN BOUNDS? NO. MICHAEL WILSON. BACK IT COMES TO THE 49TH. KIRK: HIS MOMENTUM TAKES HIM OUT OF BOUNDS. UNABLE TO GET THE ELBOW OR THE LEFT FOOT DOWN. TRIES TO GET THE ELBOW -- THE LOCATION OF THE BALL. HE IS OUT OF BOUNDS. THE MOMENTUM TAKING HIM TO THE BOUNDARY. AL: THIRD AND FOUR. A FOURTH DOWN SITUATION HERE. TRY TO GET THE FIRST. THROWS. DROPPED. IT WAS RIGHT THERE. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FIRST DOWN. MCBRIDE. FOURTH DOWN. FOURTH AND FOUR. KIRK: THEY ARE GOING TO GO FOR THIS. THEY ARE LOOKING AT THIS WITH TWO TIME-OUTS AND THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING. THIS IS THE SERIES FOR THEM. WITHERSPOON, ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS ON DEFENSE READ THAT AND MOVED LATE TO KNOCK THAT AWAY. HERE WE GO. AL: FOURTH AND FOUR. THREE MINUTES LEFT IN THE FOURTH. THE CROWD AND 4. THREE MINUTES LEFT IN THE FOURTH. KIRK: MCBRIDE RIGHT THERE. HARRISON AT THE BOTTOM. TIMEOUT, SEATTLE, THEIR FIRST. 30 SECONDS. AL: SEAHAWKS TAKE A TIMEOUT. WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT D IN THIS SITUATION. KIRK: YOU ASKED ME IN THE OPEN, WHAT DOES IT TAKE FOR THE CARDINALS TO TAKE THAT NEXTHE HAS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE PLAYS LIKE THIS ON THIS KIND OF DRIVE. TONIGHTS GAME CHANGER PRESENTED BY NOVARTIS. WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT SEAHAWKS, A CHANCE TO GO UP BY THREE POSSESSIONS. THEY HOLD FRUSTRATED JAXON SMITH-NJIGBA, BUT THE RIGHT CALL. YOU HAVE MAURICE, OHIO STATE RECEIVER, GREAT THROW. HE BRINGS IT DOWN AS AN XL MOMENT THAT GOT THEM WITHIN SEVEN. DEFENSE COMES UP WITH A STOP , MR. FIELD GOAL, AND HERE WE ARE, FOURTH AND FOUR, GOT TO CONVERT. THIS IS WHERE MURRAY CAN ELEVATE. AL: THEY ARE 3-3 ON FOURTH DOWN THIS SEASON. WILSON SETS UP ON A WING TO THE LEFT. THROWS, ONE HANDS IT. FIRST DOWN. KIRK: ARE YOU KIDDING ME WITH THIS CATCH? WHAT A JOB, MICHAEL WILSON. HE BARELY GETS HIS HEAD TURNED AROUND AND BY THE TIME HE DOES, THE BALL IS OFF HIS RIGHT ARM AND HE SECURES IT. AL: STAYED IN BOUNDS. HERE IS DEMERCADO AND HE WILL GET TAKEN DOWN. JULIAN LOVE STOPS HIM THERE. TWO AND A HALF TO GO. KIRK: THE RUNNING GAME GOING TO THE OUTSIDE IS SO TOUGH. THAT TIME THE CENTER AND RIGHT GUARD. HECK OF BY ISAIAH ADAMS. AL: EXTRA PRESSURE, MURRAY TRYING TO ESCAPE, HE CANNOT. GETS SPUN DOWN BY DRAKE THOMAS. THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE TWO MINUTE WARNING WITH A THIRD AND 9 NEXT. GANG WILL DISCUSS THIS ONE, TALKING ABOUT OTHER THINGS GOING ON AROUND THE LEAGUE. MEANWHILE, THIRD DOWN AND 9, HUGE PLAY. ACTUALLY IN THIS SITUATION, THEY HAVE CLEARLY TWO CHANCES TO GET THE FIRST DOWN. NEED NINE. KIRK: HARRISON MADE THE BIG CATCH, HE IS DOWN AT THE BOTTOM ONE-ON-ONE. AL: RYAN COMES OUT OF THE SLOT. TAKES TO THE 30 FOUR A DOWN. KIRK: SEATTLE BROUGHT THE BLITZ. THEY BROUGHT SEVEN GUYS. MURRAY JUST HAD TO GET RID OF THE BALL, AND HE GIVES IT TO DORTCH, WHO IS THEIR MOST DANGEROUS RECEIVER, AFTER THE CATCH. THIS IS WHERE SEVEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE PLAYS OFF. AL: BUCK AND I HAVE TO GO. PRESSURE AGAIN, EXTRA MAN. CATCH IS MADE. OUT OF BOUNDS. DEMERCADO WITH A GOOD BLOCK. KIRK: MIKE MACDONALD IS NOT SITTING BACK. THE WAY THEY HAVE BEEN PLAYING ZONE, HE HAS BEEN DIALING UP PRESSURE TO TRY TO GET MURRAY OFF HIS SPOT. THEY ARE LOSING SOME RECEIVERS IN COVERAGE. AL: SECOND AND FIVE, THEY BRING MICHAEL CARTER INTO THE GAME. DORTCH MOVING. MURRAY OFF HIS BACK FOOT, INCOMPLETE. MCBRIDE IS THERE, LOOKS FOR THE PLAY, GETS NINE. JULIAN LOVE WITH THE COVERAGE. KIRK: LOVE ISKIRK: GOING FOR THE FOOTBALL. HE IS ENTITLED TO GO UP AND MAKE A PLAY ON THE BALL. SO THERE IS NO INTERFERENCE ON EITHER GUY. BOTH GO UP, MAKE A PLAY ON THE FOOTBALL. LOOK AT LOVES EYES, COMPLETELY PLAYING THE BALL. AL: THIRD AND FIVE. KIRK: WHAT A MOMENT FOR THE CARDINALS. WHAT A MOMENT FOR KYLER MURRAY. AL: ONE OF THESE TEAMS WILL BE 3-1 AT THE END OF THE GAME. THE OTHER DROPS TO 2-2. TIMEOUT, ARIZONA. AL: PLAY CLOCK IS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO TWO, NOT EXACTLY WHERE YOU WANT TO USE YOUR TIMEOUT. KIRK: BETTER THAN USING FIVE YARDS ON A THIRD AND 5. AL: FOR SURE. KIRK: BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO HOLD ONTO THAT. AT LEAST THEY HAVE THE ONE THEY NEED TO HANG ONTO AS LONG AS THEY CAN. MARVIN HARRISON, YOU BROUGHT IT OUT. INTERESTING NIGHT. YOU GO FROM, WHATS WRONG WITH MARVIN HARRISON THIS TEAM HAS CONTINUED FROM LAST WEEK INTO THIS WEEK. THEN HE HAS THE BIG TOUCHDOWN CATCH, IT GET HIS CONFIDENCE BACK. IF YOU GET HIM ISOLATED IN A ONE-ON-ONE MATCHUP, YOU BALL, THAT SLOT FADE. AL: THERE HE IS IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT WAS A THREE RECEIVER SET. DORTCH COMES TO THE RIGHT SIDE. THERE HE IS IN THE SLOT, THIRD DOWN AND FIVE. MURRAY GOING. MAKING THE GRAB. HARRISON. WITHERSPOON COVERING ON A PLAY. KIRK: JUST SAID SLOT FADE. GIVE HIM THE CHANCE. LET HIM USE HIS BODY. WHAT A PLACE TO LOCATE THE FOOTBALL BY MURRAY, BACK SHOULDER. LET HIS RECEIVER ADJUST TO THE BALL. AL: 18 YARDS, FIRST AND GOAL. THEY CAN TAKE THEIR TIME. THEY DONT WANT TO LEAVE SEATTLE ANYTIME IF THEY DONT HAVE TO. PLAY CLOCK INSIDE 10. TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. DEMERCADO, SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. KIRK: JONATHAN GANNON ITS IS ABOUT TO CALL TIMEOUT. SEATTLE IS CALLING. AL: THEY ARE SAVING TIME. THATS INTERESTING. KIRK: THEY WANT MARVIN HARRISON TO PLAY 1000 MILES AN HOUR. THEY WANT HIM TO PLAY PHYSICAL WITH HIS SIZE, TACK THE BALL. HERE HE IS AGAINST ONE OF THE BEST. WITHERSPOON DOESNT REALLY LOCATE THE FOOTBALL. HE IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE DOWNFIELD. BRINGS HIM BACK ON A BACK SHOULDER FADE. DOESNT USE THE BODY, BUT HE SECURES THAT. YOU THOUGHT HE MIGHT GO THERE OVERTOP. AL: SIX CATCHES TOTAL, 66 YARDS. SECOND AND GOAL AT THE 7. FOUR MAN RUSH. CATCH IS MADE. CAN HE GET TO THE END ZONE? YES! EMARI DEMERCADO. NOW THEY GO FOR THE WIN OR OVERTIME? KIRK: I THINK WITH ALL THIS MOMENTUM, THIS PLACE IS ALIVE. THESE LAST TWO POSSESSIONS HAVE CHANGED EVERYTHING. YOU WANT THIS GAME TO GET INTO OVERTIME IF YOU ARE THE CARDINALS. AND WE JUST CHALLENGED KYLER MURRAY. YOU WANT THIS FRANCHISE TO CHANGE? MURRAY IS GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE PLAYS TO GET HIS GUYS TO BELIEVE WE CAN WIN THESE KIND OF GAMES, AND HE HAS DONE THAT. AL: RYLAND WITH THE EXTRA POINT. WITH 28 SECONDS, 20-20. KIRK: WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT MARVIN HARRISON, YOU THINK ABOUT 85 TO THE RIGHT, MCBRIDE. INSTEAD OUT ON THE BLACK -- THE BACKFIELD. DEMERCADO, THATS WHAT HE IS KNOWN FOR. HE CAN SNEAK OUT. THE DEFENSE REALLY LOSES IT. THEN ITS A FOOT RACE AGAINST WITHERSPOON AND HE GETS TO THE CORNER FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. AL: DEMERCADO HAS BEEN THIRD DOWN. HE HAS SEEN A LOT OF ACTION THE NEXT FEW MINUTES, MUCH MORE THAN BENSON HAS. KIRK: YOUVE AND DAY WAY TO WIN A GAME LIKE THIS, ITS NOT ONLY YOUR RECORD CHANGE, THIS IS A BIG MORALE BUILDER. THIS GAME LOOKS LIKE IT WAS OVER. WE WERE UP HERE THINKING, POOR GUYS AGAINST THIS DEFENSE, NO WAY THEY ARE GOING TO SCORE A TOUCHDOWN. NOW THEY HAVE PUT A COUPLE OF. AL: YOU WIND UP HAVING A GOOD SEASON, YOU GO BY MOMENTS. THIS WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS. TURNING TO FEED INTO A POSSIBLE VICTORY. WAS SHORT -- THAT KICK WAS SHORT OF THE LANDING ZONE. NOW YOU BRING IT BACK OUT TO THE 40. BALL IS PLACED AT THE 40 YARD LINE. FIRST DOWN. AL: REMEMBER WHEN YOU KICK A TOUCHBACK THESE DAYS -- THAT IS SHORT OF IT. THERE IS YOUR EVIDENCE. THAT WILL COST YOU ANOTHER FIVE YARDS INSTEAD OF A TOUCHBACK. NOW SEATTLE TRYING TO GET INTO FIELD GOAL RANGE. KIRK: LETS LOOK AT OUR NEXT GEN STATS POWERED BY AWS. WIN PROBABILITY. THIS IS A GAME THAT WAS FOR THE MOST PART OVER. LOWEST WIN PROBABILITY OF THE NIGHT, 3.6, AND HERE WE ARE TIED. AL: CUPP IN MOTION. SMITH-NJIGBA TO THE LEFT. DARNOLD THROWING. NOBODY HOME. THAT LAST ARIZONA DRIVE, 12 PLAYS, 57 YARDS. SEATTLE MISSED THAT 53 YARD FIELD GOAL. KIRK: TRYING TO GET INSIDE THE 45 YARD LINE TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE. JASON MYERS. INSIDE 45, YOU GIVE HIM A SHOT. AL: SECOND AND 10. DARNOLD FROM THE SIDELINE, CANT. GETTING OUT OF BOUNDS, SMITH-NJIGBA, BUT THEY SAY NO. THE CLOCK CONTINUES TO RUN. SEATTLE HAS ONE TIMEOUT AND ARE GOING TO TAKE IT HERE WITH 12 SECONDS. TIMEOUT, SEATTLE. 16 SECONDS. THE THIRD AND FINAL OF THE HALF. KIRK: OHIO STATE RECEIVERS TRYING TO MAKE BIG PLAYS TO WIN THE GAME. JAXON SMITH-NJIGBA, MUCH LIKE HIS PREVIOUS TEAMMATE, BACK SHOULDER FADE. GOOD BALL, GOOD TIMING BY SAM DARNOLD. LOOK WHERE HE PUTS THIS, ANOTHER DB THAT STRUGGLES TO FIND THE FOOTBALL. AL: THEY ARE GOING TO REVIEW TO SEE IF HE WAS IN OR OUT OF BOUNDS. IF THEY RULE HIM OUT, THEY PUT A FEW MORE SECONDS ON THE CLOCK. KIRK: HE LOOKED OUT OF BOUNDS, RIGHT? TERRY: HE IS CLEARLY OUT OF BOUNDS. THEY ARE EXPEDITING THE REVIEW AND ARE GOING TO GIVE SEATTLE THERE TIMEOUT BACK. AL: RIGHT NOW IT IS STOPPED AT 16 SECONDS BEFORE THEY PULLED THE TIMEOUT. HERE IT IS. AFTER REVIEW, THE RUNNER MADE IT OUT OF BOUNDS THAT 18 SECONDS. PLEASE RESET THE GAME CLOCK TO 18 SECONDS. SEATTLE GETS THEIR GAME CLOCK BACK. AL: YOU HAVE 18 SECONDS RIGHT NOW. IF YOU DONT GET ANOTHER YARD, YOU ARE LOOKING AT A 56 YARD FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT. KIRK: OBVIOUSLY THE EFFORT PLAY TO GET OUT OF BOUNDS, NOT JUST STOP THE CLOCK. YOU GET THE TIMEOUT BACK, WHICH WE ALL KNOW YOU WANT. YOU WANT TO HOLD ONTO THAT TIMEOUT. YOU NEVER KNOW WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN. AL: AL: INJURED BOTH -- NJIGBA AND KUPP. TIMEOUT TAKEN BY ARIZONA, THEIR LAST. LOOKING HOW SEATTLE IS GOING TO LINE UP. DO YOU LINE UP THE SAME WAY OR WHAT? MYERS, 61 CAREER LONG FOR HIM. KIRK: HE HIT ONE OVER 59, 2-2 ON 50 PLUS THIS YEAR. IF YOU ARE JUST TUNING IN, ARIZONA, THEIR FIRST NINE DRIVES, MOST OF THIS GAME, 138 YARDS AND SIX POINTS. THE LAST TWO DRIVES, 115 AND 14 POINTS WHERE MURRAY AND THIS OFFENSE FINALLY PUT IT TOGETHER AND PLAYED WITH MUCH MORE URGENCY. AL: 18 SECONDS, FIRST DOWN. ON THE GROUND, SPINNING. SOME TOUGH YARDAGE. TAKES US TO THE 34 YARD LINE. ALMOST AS IF THEY ARE GOING TO PUT THIS ON MYERS FOOT SOONER THAN LATER. CHARBONNET CARRYING THERE. SEATTLES THIRD AND FINAL TIMEOUT, TOOK IT AT FOUR SECONDS. AL: YOU ARE LOOKING AT A 52 YARD FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT. KIRK: BECAUSE OF THAT EFFORT , FIVE YARDS MORE THAN WHAT HE GOT FROM WHERE HE WAS BY TWO DEFENDERS. AL: HE MISSED FROM 53, MYERS. HE HAS MADE FROM 44 AND 31. SEAHAWKS TRYING TO MAKE IT EIGHT STRAIGHT OVER THE CARDINALS. STOLL TO SNAP IT. FROM 52, THE KICK WOBBLE BUT MAKES IT THROUGH. AND THE SEAHAWKS WIN IT AT THE GUN. TURNED OUT TO BE SOME GAME AT THE FINISH. ARIZONA COMING FROM BEHIND, CAME BACK FROM THE DEAD ONLY TO SEE SEATTLE WIN AT THE GUN. 23-20 OUR FINAL SCORE. KIRK: A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING HERE. WHAT A JOB, THE SNAP, THE HOLD, THE KICK. LEAKED A LITTLE BIT BUT STAYS INSIDE. LETS NOT FORGET THE KICK OFF LANDING ZONE INFRACTION THAT PUT THE BALL AT THE 40 YARD LINE TO GIVE THEM THE FIELD GOAL POSITION THEY NEEDED TO GET INTO FIELD GOAL RANGE. AL: THE LOOK OF A MAN AND A TEAM THAT HAS LOST BACK-TO-BACK GAMES IN THE LAST FOUR DAYS ON LAST SECOND FIELD GOALS. 49ERS BEAT THEM ON SUNDAY, TONIGHT THE SAME THING. KIRK: LAST WEEKEND, NINE OR 10 GAMES CAME DOWN TO THE FINAL POSSESSION, LAST MOMENT OF THE GAME. IT CANT GET ANY MORE EXCITING. NOW TO KICK OFF THE WEEKEND, WE GIVE YOU ANOTHER ONE ON THURSDAY NIGHT. AL: NEXT WEEK, 49ERS AGAINST THE RAMS ON THURSDAY NIGHT.
