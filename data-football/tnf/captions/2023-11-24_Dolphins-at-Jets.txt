[ct=1.163] Miami won the toss.
[ct=2.449] They've deferred.
[ct=3.618] Jason Sanders to kick off.
[ct=5.033] Xavier Gibson back to receive for New York,
[ct=8.985] and off we go on Black Friday from the Meadowlands
[ct=13.004] starting at the 25 yard line, and immediately, we will
[ct=15.617] see the New Jets quarterback.
[ct=18.271] Tim Boyle went to Connecticut for three years, college
[ct=22.254] football, then went to Eastern Kentucky for one.
[ct=26.256] Been around.
[ct=27.578] In Green Bay for three years.
[ct=28.892] Backed up Aaron Rodgers.
[ct=30.243] Went to Detroit.
[ct=31.573] Played three games when Jared Goff got hurt.
[ct=33.668] Went to Chicago at the end of last year.
[ct=35.622] Came here, and here he is, something new,
[ct=40.814] Can he give them a spark?
[ct=47.526] Breece Hall is the running back, and he goes nowhere
[ct=54.128] against that Dolphin defense.
[ct=55.460] That's Bradley Chubb right there, making the stop.
[ct=58.117] We were talking to Robert Saleh about the quarterback change
[ct=62.093] and all of that.
[ct=63.457] He says, hey, maybe he's the next Kurt Warner.
[ct=64.988] They can only pray.
[ct=66.222] Yeah.
[ct=67.426] I think, for fans that aren't familiar with him,
[ct=70.106] and many aren't, he brings poise.
[ct=71.407] I think what you saw last week is, when they throw the ball,
[ct=75.317] one of the problems with Zach Wilson
[ct=76.542] is he held the ball too long.
[ct=77.808] A lot of sacks, a lot of turnovers.
[ct=79.339] I think, tonight, it's just about cleaning things up
[ct=80.699] when when they do throw, get the ball out of his hands,
[ct=83.580] especially against this Dolphins defense.
[ct=85.828] So the Jets now backup quarterbacks on the sideline.
[ct=89.642] Nice run here after the 32 yard line,
[ct=92.542] setting up a third down and 2, and Jerome Baker
[ct=96.713] is a little slow in the rising and hops back
[ct=99.107] to the defensive huddle.
[ct=101.666] Third down.
[ct=102.967] Think about this.
[ct=102.980] This is an offense that has scored
[ct=104.211] one touchdown in the last 46 possessions, so for Tim Boyle
[ct=110.883] tonight, it's, again, showing poise and making
[ct=114.866] good decisions.
[ct=114.961] Saw Aaron Rodgers on the sideline.
[ct=117.545] Comes to a lot of the Jets games since the injury.
[ct=121.517] Third and 2.
[ct=121.609] They go no huddle here, and you've
[ct=124.131] got a flag and a free play, and the pass is caught up
[ct=128.152] at the 37 yard line.
[ct=129.519] So either way, they were going to wind up with the first
[ct=132.112] down here because Bradley Chubb came across the line.
[ct=134.962] Showing that experience with Aaron Rodgers.
[ct=137.476] He used that hard count at a great time
[ct=140.116] there on third down and short.
[ct=145.428] So with Aaron, he was in Green Bay
[ct=148.049] three years, two of those with Nathaniel Hackett,
[ct=150.760] who's his offensive coordinator now with the Jets.
[ct=156.311] John Hussey is our referee.
[ct=158.756] Offside, defense number 92.
[ct=161.490] That five yard penalty results in a first down.
[ct=165.338] And honestly, I think that's why he's on the roster--
[ct=167.980] Nathaniel Hackett's background and experience with him,
[ct=170.611] and those couple of years in Green Bay,
[ct=173.330] and his familiarity with the scheme.
[ct=174.618] That's the thing that I think will be different to fans
[ct=177.304] watching, is he has command of the offense because
[ct=181.403] of his time in Green Bay.
[ct=182.616] He's a guy that, even when he was the third guy this year,
[ct=185.265] he's showing up at 6:00 in the morning.
[ct=187.940] Always prepping and always showing up
[ct=189.249] and doing the right thing.
[ct=190.541] And speaks glowingly of his time with Rodgers.
[ct=194.695] Play action.
[ct=195.903] Pass is high and incomplete there.
[ct=198.450] Intended for Jeremy Ruckert.
[ct=202.430] So for Boyle, there they are in Green Bay.
[ct=206.407] It's funny because you look at-- and again, another shot,
[ct=209.023] Rodgers, Hackett, and Boyle.
[ct=211.975] We told you before, he went to Connecticut,
[ct=214.361] and his statistics in college were awful.
[ct=218.346] The other day, in his words, he said they're piss poor,
[ct=221.248] and they're worse than that, but he got a chance.
[ct=225.021] He had a great Pro Day, he said.
[ct=226.330] Green Bay happened to be there, and they invited him in.
[ct=228.977] They did.
[ct=230.446] Breece Hall is the running back, and he gets corralled
[ct=234.326] behind the line of scrimmage.
[ct=235.658] Jaelan Phillips, number 15, is right there.
[ct=238.265] That Dolphin defense, which of course,
[ct=240.921] was paling in comparison to the offense early in the season,
[ct=243.640] but now, really starting to come on.
[ct=244.995] Yeah, Vic Fangio, one thing you always think about
[ct=248.922] is having great outside linebackers,
[ct=250.234] and he's got Chubb on one side and Phillips on the other.
[ct=252.982] And we always equate great outside backers
[ct=255.776] in this scheme with their ability
[ct=258.231] to rush the quarterback.
[ct=259.566] But Vic Fangio quickly to point out
[ct=260.844] how good these guys are at setting that edge,
[ct=263.550] and great example there by Phillips.
[ct=264.816] So five wide including Dalvin Cook, who is in the game.
[ct=270.203] Four-man rush.
[ct=272.809] Boyle throws.
[ct=272.875] Caught up at the 40 yard line, but well shy of the first down.
[ct=276.812] Garrett Wilson making the catch there,
[ct=279.440] so they picked up a first down off the penalty,
[ct=283.296] and now have to punt.
[ct=283.447] Keep in mind, we're going to talk so much about Boyle,
[ct=286.046] but Robert Saleh also talking to us on the field
[ct=289.986] This offensive line-- and we'll talk more about it.
[ct=292.632] It has been a revolving door, having
[ct=296.640] their eighth different offensive line combination today.
[ct=300.325] So when they get in third and long,
[ct=301.960] they're in big trouble protecting the quarterback.
[ct=304.574] Thomas Morstead, 14th year in the league,
[ct=307.217] most of those with the Saints early on.
[ct=309.943] Braxton Berrios to run it back.
[ct=316.531] Fair catch called for, made, 15 yard line,
[ct=319.038] and that's where the Miami Dolphins will start
[ct=322.885] their first drive with Tua--
[ct=324.186] Meanwhile from the 15 yard line.
[ct=326.857] Miami begins this drive with a Mostert run.
[ct=329.506] He goes nowhere, and right there,
[ct=331.070] Quinnen Williams, number 95, taking him down for a loss.
[ct=334.651] And now you got some action on the field,
[ct=337.251] and you got flags all over the place.
[ct=341.274] Well, with this offensive line moving around some new pieces
[ct=345.242] up front--
[ct=346.540] After the play was over, personal foul, unnecessary
[ct=347.885] roughness.
[ct=349.230] Defense, number 70.
[ct=349.473] That 15 yard penalty will be enforced on the previous spot.
[ct=354.380] Automatic first down.
[ct=355.870] Yeah, the flags were flying.
[ct=357.160] Quinton Jefferson flagged.
[ct=359.831] Well, this Jets defense came out even when we were at the break.
[ct=363.723] Correction, the penalty was a dead ball foul,
[ct=364.991] so it was enforced from the end of the run.
[ct=367.700] Yeah, they're bouncing around, showing a lot of energy,
[ct=370.357] and then they make a big play with Quinnen Williams.
[ct=371.694] And then all that is taken away because of a dead ball
[ct=375.713] foul right here after the whistle with Jefferson.
[ct=382.393] I mean, that was--
[ct=383.555] the timing of that is when it was
[ct=384.975] called, well after the whistle.
[ct=388.687] Sometimes, we see that, and we think, that wasn't that bad,
[ct=391.424] but I think if you realized how late it came,
[ct=394.203] it caught the attention of the officials.
[ct=396.675] The enforcement of the penalty was after the play was over.
[ct=399.312] Therefore, we're going to enforce it from the 11 yard
[ct=402.184] line to the 26, and it's an automatic first down.
[ct=407.298] And Robert Salah just took Jefferson out of the game
[ct=412.557] and replaces him with Solomon Thomas.
[ct=415.261] Yeah, the intent there with the headbutt,
[ct=417.871] you just got a lot of energy here early.
[ct=420.645] Penned them back inside the 20 to 15.
[ct=423.222] That's a big deal for this defense.
[ct=424.603] They want 3 and outs, and they want
[ct=427.085] to give their offense great field position,
[ct=428.427] so they make a mental error here on the first play.
[ct=433.757] Tagovailoa, the only left handed starting quarterback
[ct=436.723] in the league.
[ct=437.688] It's dropped, and then recovered at the 32 yard line.
[ct=441.678] Mostert is there.
[ct=442.973] Had it.
[ct=444.346] Recovered it.
[ct=444.529] Ashtyn Davis covering on the play.
[ct=447.036] Gain of 5.
[ct=448.244] Really good job by Davis there in coverage, and even
[ct=451.897] a better job by the defense forcing
[ct=454.551] Tua to have to work back all the way to his third option.
[ct=457.212] That ball is out.
[ct=458.531] That's a live ball.
[ct=458.636] Miami fortunate to get back on it.
[ct=463.708] They're going to take--
[ct=463.994] they're actually going to challenge this, Al.
[ct=470.366] Well, Hussey goes over to check with Saleh.
[ct=477.020] The New York Jets are challenging the ruling
[ct=479.603] on the field of a completed catch.
[ct=486.417] Timeout.
[ct=486.525] So that challenge comes less than four minutes
[ct=489.028] into the game.
[ct=489.508] Take another look.
[ct=491.497] Did he control it?
[ct=492.814] Did he not?
[ct=493.026] [music playing]
[ct=495.455] Terry McCauley indicates incomplete.
[ct=498.109] We'll see the review.
[ct=507.429] The call has been reversed because it's ruled
[ct=511.633] that Mostert had two feet down.
[ct=515.400] Didn't take a move after that, so they do--
[ct=518.040] the Jets do win the challenge, and it makes it
[ct=522.313] second down and 10 instead of second down and 5.
[ct=524.644] But, Kirk, you make a challenge like that early
[ct=527.243] on on a relatively inconsequential play,
[ct=530.868] and you wonder, does it come back?
[ct=532.207] Especially if you lose it, then you're only down to one.
[ct=534.866] You don't see too many early challenges like that.
[ct=536.385] You don't see that often, but I think
[ct=537.537] it shows you the confidence and how much they knew that this
[ct=540.193] was going to be reversed.
[ct=541.545] And also, they get Tua behind the sticks
[ct=544.188] by getting that incompletion.
[ct=545.537] But now, Hill has it, and Hill is out of bounds
[ct=550.832] after a couple.
[ct=552.127] Let's take a look at some of the Tagovailoa statistics
[ct=556.111] this year, and they are great.
[ct=560.123] 70%, almost 3,000 yards, 2 and 1/2 to 1 touchdown
[ct=564.255] to interception ratio, 21 touchdowns, third in the NFL.
[ct=569.379] And you think back to last year, those two serious concussions.
[ct=574.707] He even thought about, well, maybe it's time to retire,
[ct=577.355] but here he is, coming back and playing great.
[ct=581.407] Third and 8.
[ct=589.122] Down the sideline.
[ct=591.086] Guess who's out in front?
[ct=591.270] And a saving tackle at the end of the play, and hopping away
[ct=597.695] is Hill.
[ct=597.810] He makes the grab.
[ct=600.347] He went to the ground.
[ct=600.483] He gets tripped up by DJ Reed to save
[ct=603.092] a touchdown in all likelihood, but now, after a 36 yard gain,
[ct=608.402] He came out of last week's game with a hand injury for a while.
[ct=612.355] Got back in, and now this.
[ct=613.710] Yeah, third down and long, you're
[ct=615.069] going to put corners on islands.
[ct=615.191] DJ Reed is very good, but you're talking about one of one
[ct=619.035] with Tyreek Hill and staying with him on that slot fade.
[ct=621.685] Fortunate just to catch up with him and bring him down.
[ct=626.947] So Hill on the sideline.
[ct=628.298] Line of scrimmage is the 37, and this is Waddle.
[ct=636.194] And what a 1-2 punch that is, Hill and Waddle.
[ct=640.271] Jordan Whitehead is right there, and Hill in some pain
[ct=644.270] on the Dolphins bench.
[ct=647.013] He got behind coverage, a great throw.
[ct=649.784] The timing, amazing, and just gets
[ct=654.869] caught there as he was coming down with Reed,
[ct=658.857] making that tackle from behind.
[ct=660.187] But how about how they stretch you not just vertically?
[ct=664.170] They stretch you horizontally.
[ct=666.810] The presnap movement puts so much
[ct=668.180] on the eyes of the defense, especially
[ct=670.790] the linebackers and safeties.
[ct=672.438] Lead the league in scoring.
[ct=673.586] Lead the league in yards per game.
[ct=677.482] And that's incomplete, that pass off
[ct=678.768] the hands of Durham Smythe, the tight end,
[ct=682.758] to make it third down and 2 at the Jets 29 yard line.
[ct=685.576] And the equalizer tonight for this defense
[ct=689.397] has got to be the defensive front, which is obviously
[ct=692.079] a strength with Quinnen Williams and Jermaine Johnson, John
[ct=696.073] They can get pressure without having to bring the blitz,
[ct=700.055] and those guys are going to have to dominate against a Miami
[ct=702.693] offense that's beat up as far as the interior.
[ct=706.653] Conner Williams is fine at center,
[ct=708.025] but you got a couple backups playing, Eichenberg
[ct=709.573] on that right guard and Lester Cotton,
[ct=711.980] the same lineup they used last week in their game.
[ct=714.661] Guess who's back?
[ct=716.010] That didn't take long.
[ct=717.261] Sat out one play.
[ct=718.612] Third down and 2 now, and--
[ct=722.590] First charged timeout Miami.
[ct=725.239] Timeout taken here by Mike McDaniel and the Dolphins,
[ct=728.023] and we go to Kaylee.
[ct=729.242] Tyreek Hill got a quick exam of his left foot
[ct=732.097] while he was on the sidelines.
[ct=733.243] They spatted him up, and he ran right back out there.
[ct=735.904] But, guys, he was on the injury report week
[ct=738.594] 11 because of that foot.
[ct=741.264] That was like going to urgent care drive-through.
[ct=744.147] Well, he is so motivated not just individually,
[ct=749.488] because this guy, he's on pace to go over
[ct=751.925] 2,000 yards as a receiver, which we've never seen.
[ct=755.902] Obviously, Calvin Johnson had a magical year,
[ct=758.568] came close with his 16 games.
[ct=761.185] But he's not a selfish guy.
[ct=762.586] How many times have we heard from Miami folks
[ct=765.175] about how hard he works in practice, what a great teammate
[ct=769.153] he is, how much he energizes everybody
[ct=770.516] with his approach on a day to day basis?
[ct=774.499] Well, of course, he came over from Kansas City.
[ct=778.479] Great amount of success there, obviously.
[ct=779.825] And then the trade, and loving it in South Beach.
[ct=789.103] Here's Hill.
[ct=789.450] First down.
[ct=790.445] Lots more.
[ct=791.732] Bounces off a couple of tackles.
[ct=794.419] Takes it to about the 10 yard line.
[ct=795.812] Tackled there by DJ Reed, and you got Alec Ingold leading
[ct=799.690] the way with a nice block.
[ct=799.917] Al, you know it's coming.
[ct=801.074] You just don't know, is he going to jet motion
[ct=803.686] I mean, Reed is out-- his second time he's out here by himself.
[ct=806.386] Now, he's got to respond to this.
[ct=807.680] Now, he's got momentum, and instead
[ct=809.009] of continuing across the field, he catches that quick throw.
[ct=811.835] And look at the convoy he's got in front of him.
[ct=814.352] I mean, it's tough enough to tackle this guy in space.
[ct=816.970] Now, you get him in space and look at these linemen
[ct=819.655] out in front, athletic, and helping him almost
[ct=822.309] get to the end zone.
[ct=824.967] Drive started at its own 15 for Miami--
[ct=828.978] Now, first and 10.
[ct=830.280] Hill, this time, in the slot.
[ct=831.602] Fake it to him.
[ct=832.913] Toss it to Mostert, and stays in bounds for three or four yards.
[ct=838.324] Second down.
[ct=839.572] Yeah, they just stay one step ahead of you
[ct=840.886] with the execution, and a lot of people talk about the speed,
[ct=846.179] But I think Tua Tagovailoa has taken a different step
[ct=848.907] in his second year with Mike McDaniel and the execution
[ct=852.887] of this offense, the things that he does presnap.
[ct=855.490] There's so much movement, and how
[ct=858.142] he is in command in how comfortable
[ct=859.479] he is with what he's seeing from the defenses.
[ct=862.309] He and Mike McDaniel work very, very well together
[ct=866.111] and allow him to really orchestrate this offense.
[ct=870.075] It's really a match made in heaven,
[ct=872.778] the way it looks right now.
[ct=874.253] Second down and 4.
[ct=878.051] Slips to the outside.
[ct=879.420] Breaking a tackle.
[ct=880.794] Picks up about one.
[ct=882.060] Mostert broke away from Quincy Williams.
[ct=884.730] Mostert in his ninth year in the league.
[ct=887.390] Guys in their ninth year in the league
[ct=890.012] normally aren't what they were in the combine,
[ct=892.715] but this guy is still as fast as he ever was.
[ct=893.998] Yeah, you back, and you look at his career, his first five
[ct=896.696] years, he was just trying to make a roster.
[ct=899.326] He's a lot of practice squad moments,
[ct=900.571] and you think that the guy's not going to be able to do much.
[ct=903.518] But look at his numbers now, I mean,
[ct=907.298] the fact he's averaging 5.2 yards a carry.
[ct=910.005] I think he says it all, and he's a great complement to what
[ct=912.628] they do on the perimeter.
[ct=913.959] 11 rushing TDs, 13 TDs total.
[ct=918.136] Third and 3.
[ct=919.506] Tua, in the pocket, has time.
[ct=923.267] Comes out the back door.
[ct=923.274] Keeps it himself and gets upended by Whitehead
[ct=927.376] inside the 5 yard line.
[ct=928.793] So now, you have fourth and 2, and we'll
[ct=932.500] see about McDaniel's call here.
[ct=941.822] So you got a man--
[ct=941.896] these two guys were on the same staff in San Francisco.
[ct=944.675] McDaniel, offensive pedigree.
[ct=947.177] Saleh, of course, the defensive pedigree.
[ct=949.794] Leave the offense in here right here.
[ct=951.126] Who wins?
[ct=955.143] Fourth and 2.
[ct=959.115] Now, he comes back inside a little bit.
[ct=965.758] Going that way, and can Hill pull it in?
[ct=968.510] He cannot.
[ct=969.759] Sauce Gardner covering on the play,
[ct=972.537] so there is a big time matchup, the great receiver,
[ct=976.645] the great corner, and the Jets win
[ct=980.367] that mini battle to keep it scoreless with 6 and 1/2
[ct=984.316] to go in the opening quarter.
[ct=988.436] Great ball just goes right through the hands--
[ct=991.043] On Hill, even though he was out for only one play.
[ct=994.965] Could not.
[ct=996.254] McDaniel checking with him.
[ct=998.980] He'll say, man, I should have had that one.
[ct=1001.818] Look at this.
[ct=1003.152] Woo.
[ct=1004.263] That's on Tua's right arm, his non-throwing arm.
[ct=1008.273] What a gash.
[ct=1008.547] A chunk there.
[ct=1011.118] So meanwhile, from the 5 yard line, now, second drive.
[ct=1017.291] Breece Hall is the running back.
[ct=1019.997] Look out in the end zone, and he squirts it away.
[ct=1022.656] And it's picked up by the Dolphins at the 5 yard line,
[ct=1029.237] It's Jaelan Phillips who's there.
[ct=1031.967] That's an incompletion.
[ct=1034.758] Officials checking with each other.
[ct=1037.242] Was the arm coming forward?
[ct=1037.577] There's Carl Johnson, who used to be the head of officiating.
[ct=1042.556] He comes in, tells John Hussey, who tells us.
[ct=1045.182] Number 7 was able to throw the ball to a receiver in the area.
[ct=1049.193] Incomplete pass.
[ct=1052.129] That's his best play here in this early part of this game.
[ct=1055.895] Just somehow, someway, getting that football out of his hands.
[ct=1059.836] Phillips has him.
[ct=1059.895] That looks like it's a safety, and just before he goes down,
[ct=1063.792] Please reset the game clock to 6:29, please.
[ct=1065.139] And fortunately, for him, it's not intentional grounding,
[ct=1067.867] where it would be a safety.
[ct=1069.099] He's able to just flip it out there to Bowden.
[ct=1074.485] So that offensive line reconstructed.
[ct=1077.069] Young trying to hold off that defense.
[ct=1083.759] Ain't easy.
[ct=1085.052] Prove it again here.
[ct=1086.561] [inaudible] taken down.
[ct=1087.698] Raekwon Davis, number 98 comes in there.
[ct=1092.966] Third down and long.
[ct=1094.271] Vic Fangio, obviously, is slanting and moving
[ct=1097.200] his defensive line at the snap of the ball, making
[ct=1102.193] this offensive line that doesn't have a lot of experience
[ct=1103.547] working together, making them have to think, after the snap,
[ct=1107.437] and it's freeing those backers against this run game
[ct=1110.213] just to get downhill in a hurry.
[ct=1112.648] And that line two rookie's a first year guy, a second year
[ct=1115.319] guy.
[ct=1116.321] They're lucky they have Tomlinson, 78,
[ct=1120.618] left guard, who's played every snap this season.
[ct=1121.942] Third and 10, deep drop, and he flips it out to the flat.
[ct=1127.261] And taking it out to the 14 yard line
[ct=1128.850] goes Tyler Conklin, the tight end, but short of the first,
[ct=1132.754] and they'll punt.
[ct=1133.902] Considering you don't make it on fourth down,
[ct=1136.508] you put Boyle in this Jets offense that's
[ct=1138.087] struggling at their own 5 yard line,
[ct=1140.509] and now, you're going to try to make them make a play.
[ct=1143.185] And they don't, so it's a 3 and out.
[ct=1144.493] Miami's going to get the ball back in great field position.
[ct=1151.152] Thomas Morstead to punt.
[ct=1153.799] Executed a fake punt last week against Buffalo,
[ct=1159.152] and it led to their only scoring drive of the afternoon.
[ct=1163.123] Berrios back to receive it.
[ct=1168.432] Morstead's kick.
[ct=1168.607] Barrios backs up.
[ct=1169.865] Fields at the 36.
[ct=1173.729] Tackled at the 44 yard line.
[ct=1177.742] 4:57 remaining in the first.
[ct=1181.686] Tua Tagovailoa coming back out.
[ct=1183.324] It's so funny.
[ct=1184.320] Early on, a couple of years ago, people
[ct=1186.963] were saying, well, maybe the Chargers
[ct=1188.316] made a better pick, one behind Tua.
[ct=1191.006] They got the better of the deal.
[ct=1192.327] But now, you look at these guys, Herbert having his issues
[ct=1196.293] obviously with the Chargers.
[ct=1197.665] Not all his fault, obviously, but this guy
[ct=1200.271] in the MVP conversation.
[ct=1201.650] Well, and I think it's easy to just react to results,
[ct=1205.602] but I think, as you and I both talked about, the fit with Mike
[ct=1209.610] McDaniel and the system that they run,
[ct=1212.116] it's really a match made in heaven,
[ct=1213.573] and it's why Tua has gone to a very different level
[ct=1216.218] in this last year and a half.
[ct=1217.550] That's Jeff Wilson Jr as the running back.
[ct=1220.143] He has the ball and picks up three to the 47 yard line.
[ct=1225.446] Tackled there by Solomon Thomas.
[ct=1226.709] Yeah, they keep trying to run the football.
[ct=1229.410] They love that outside zone, and they
[ct=1230.713] love a stretch play to just try to get out on the perimeter
[ct=1233.366] and away from the interior of what this Jets defense has,
[ct=1236.057] not just two backers in there with Mosley and Quincy
[ct=1240.034] Williams, but run the ball away from Solomon Thomas and Quinnen
[ct=1244.054] Williams because they are disruptors.
[ct=1254.652] Second and 7.
[ct=1261.523] Fake toss.
[ct=1263.953] Fired, caught, first down.
[ct=1266.579] Durham Smythe, the tight end, sixth year out of Notre Dame.
[ct=1273.238] Yeah, that's the one position they're continuing to grow,
[ct=1275.900] and I think Tua feels more and more comfortable.
[ct=1281.005] see how he works through those progressions,
[ct=1282.334] keeps his footwork, and the one thing
[ct=1283.849] that everybody has talked about Tua since his early days
[ct=1286.470] at Alabama is when he gets his feet set and his footwork,
[ct=1291.076] as good as you'll see in the league.
[ct=1292.483] How accurate a thrower he is.
[ct=1293.689] Gives these receivers a chance to make plays after the catch.
[ct=1299.542] Hill just ambled off to the sideline,
[ct=1301.488] but he's standing up along the sideline.
[ct=1303.169] Should be in on the next play, but off for this one.
[ct=1305.892] Meanwhile, here's Wilson.
[ct=1308.225] To the 30 yard line, he goes.
[ct=1310.554] Alex Ingold leading the way.
[ct=1313.012] Number 30, the block.
[ct=1316.607] Former Raider.
[ct=1317.984] Al, I'm glad you brought that up because I
[ct=1319.295] think he's the unsung hero of the Mike McDaniel offense.
[ct=1322.137] You see Juszczyk in San Francisco.
[ct=1324.577] This guy's more physical.
[ct=1325.944] Good job of taking the linebacker Quincy Williams out,
[ct=1328.801] and the offensive line on that right side just opens it up.
[ct=1332.588] So Wilson known more as a physical back in comparison
[ct=1335.212] to Mostert, but a good job up front,
[ct=1339.192] and a great job by his lead fullback, Ingle.
[ct=1341.881] Hill still out for another play.
[ct=1347.003] Wilson, again.
[ct=1348.186] Can he turn the corner?
[ct=1351.030] Gets about four there.
[ct=1352.177] CJ Mosley in on the tackle.
[ct=1357.457] And Hill comes back in.
[ct=1360.191] Mike McDaniel, I'll tell you what, man, he is quirky.
[ct=1366.768] He is authentic, and he is fun.
[ct=1370.780] What did we have, about 45 minutes with him the other day?
[ct=1373.417] We had to get him off the thing.
[ct=1374.768] You had to go catch a flight.
[ct=1376.037] He wanted to hang out and keep talking.
[ct=1378.763] Second down and 6, and that's Hill now.
[ct=1385.353] Throw it to him as he lined up deep in the backfield.
[ct=1388.094] Tries to get to the first down mark just a little short.
[ct=1393.359] DJ Reed stops him there.
[ct=1394.707] Third and 1.
[ct=1395.957] This is triple option football here, Tua Tagovailoa style
[ct=1401.329] with Mike McDaniel.
[ct=1402.676] Watch, the pitch man will be Hill,
[ct=1405.304] but he's going to throw it.
[ct=1406.695] Now, he can flip it out into the flat as well,
[ct=1409.304] if the read permits it, to Ingle.
[ct=1410.706] But instead, why not just flip it out to the speedster
[ct=1414.746] Tyreek Hill?
[ct=1417.272] Jeff Albrecht's done a really good job
[ct=1419.903] as the Jets defensive coordinator.
[ct=1422.574] His defense trying to stiffen here,
[ct=1425.225] as he did on the fourth and down on the earlier series,
[ct=1427.932] and the pass is incomplete, intended there for Smythe.
[ct=1431.846] Covered there by Mosley.
[ct=1433.187] So they went for it on fourth down
[ct=1435.840] and didn't come up with a first.
[ct=1439.837] Turned it over, and now, they're going
[ct=1441.159] to send in, at least for the moment,
[ct=1442.494] the field goal unit on a fourth and 1.
[ct=1443.790] That was a heck of a play by CJ Mosley because the eye candy--
[ct=1447.800] with third down and short, you're thinking Tyreek Hill,
[ct=1450.718] and he looks that way.
[ct=1451.762] But that hide route coming from the left
[ct=1453.310] to the right, a lot of times, he'll get out in the flat
[ct=1457.113] and be open.
[ct=1458.404] That time, Mosley sniffed that out.
[ct=1461.083] 38 yard attempt for Jason Sanders,
[ct=1465.166] and there, folks, are your first points of the afternoon.
[ct=1471.887] And the Jets to take over at the 25.
[ct=1475.665] So meanwhile, the Jets, that offense, grounded indefinitely.
[ct=1482.239] 48% of their points on field goals,
[ct=1483.555] highest rate in NFL history, minimum 10 games.
[ct=1487.536] They've scored a TD on only 23% of their red zone drives
[ct=1490.181] to get inside the 20, and they bog down,
[ct=1492.845] lowest rate in three decades.
[ct=1495.634] They trailed for 70% of the time,
[ct=1498.257] and that's the highest percentage since 98.
[ct=1503.467] What do you say?
[ct=1503.722] Not good.
[ct=1504.772] But it's going to be a great game.
[ct=1506.133] We promise.
[ct=1507.447] I mean, they're hanging in there right now.
[ct=1508.989] So far.
[ct=1510.094] Got to win with defense.
[ct=1512.737] Look out.
[ct=1514.101] Not a great way to start, and it's a six yard loss here.
[ct=1518.077] But at least they're able to retain possession.
[ct=1520.744] Phillips is right there again.
[ct=1521.014] He's everywhere, and it'll be second down and 16.
[ct=1526.051] Yeah, and this is a case where the back takes
[ct=1528.683] his eyes off the football and starts
[ct=1530.048] to look where he wants to go, just assuming he's
[ct=1532.664] going to be able to handle the ball,
[ct=1533.091] and the ball's on the ground.
[ct=1534.084] It's been that kind of year.
[ct=1535.354] How fitting, after the numbers we just showed you,
[ct=1538.079] and how tough of a year.
[ct=1539.383] I mean, they have nine offensive touchdowns, think of that,
[ct=1541.981] through 10 games.
[ct=1543.323] The Dolphins scored 10 when they played Denver.
[ct=1547.269] Got 70 points that day.
[ct=1549.977] I mean, think about that, 10 weeks or three hours.
[ct=1553.948] That pass is caught there, but a short gain for Wilson.
[ct=1558.054] He gets stopped after Van Ginkel makes the tackle.
[ct=1563.221] It'll be third and 10.
[ct=1564.537] So when you see numbers like that,
[ct=1565.020] you're going up against a defense
[ct=1567.232] that's getting better, especially
[ct=1568.546] now that Jalen Ramsey's back.
[ct=1569.901] You get behind the sticks on that first down fumble.
[ct=1572.533] You're just trying to win field position.
[ct=1575.362] It's not about trying to make a big play.
[ct=1577.884] It's trying to flip the field and, eventually, hoping
[ct=1581.848] your defense and special teams will give you a short field
[ct=1585.828] to work with.
[ct=1587.114] After Van Ginkel made that last tackle, it's third down and 10
[ct=1589.816] at the 25, and with six seconds to go in the quarter--
[ct=1597.732] False start, offense number 16.
[ct=1601.776] Five yard penalty.
[ct=1605.795] Kaylee, what you got?
[ct=1605.858] Guys, all the Jets offensive struggles have kept
[ct=1608.644] Garrett Wilson up at night.
[ct=1609.797] They held a players only meeting ahead of last Sunday's game,
[ct=1613.720] and even though they didn't play like it,
[ct=1616.355] Wilson told me they feel like they
[ct=1617.648] are going about the process correctly
[ct=1619.251] to address their problems.
[ct=1620.349] He said, there's no magic thing anyone can say.
[ct=1622.980] We've given it the world, every reason to lose faith in us.
[ct=1625.621] Now, he says, we just want to prove to ourselves
[ct=1628.339] that we are--
[ct=1629.639] It's third and 15 for the Jets from the 20 yard line.
[ct=1632.349] Al Michaels, Kirk Herbstreit, Kaylee Hartung with you
[ct=1636.607] on this Black Friday.
[ct=1640.279] Four-man rush, a little dump off here, and nothing happening.
[ct=1644.266] Jerome Baker is right there to take down Breece Hall.
[ct=1648.260] So right now, you have 102 total yards for the Jets--
[ct=1654.220] or for the Dolphins, and 22 for the Jets.
[ct=1657.233] And they keep hurting themselves.
[ct=1659.572] They had the fumble by Breece Hall.
[ct=1660.896] Brownlee, the rookie free agent receiver, with a false start
[ct=1663.561] gets them more behind the sticks at third and 15,
[ct=1666.191] and puts that much more pressure on that offensive line
[ct=1670.157] and quarterback.
[ct=1671.511] So Morstead, already his third punt.
[ct=1673.092] This one's a beauty.
[ct=1674.164] Fielded by Berrios at the 22, and a nice 18 yard
[ct=1679.470] run back up to the 40 yard line he goes after a--
[ct=1683.455] Yeah, you're talking about Curtis--
[ct=1684.786] we're talking about Curtis Martin, you and I, beforehand.
[ct=1687.364] I mean, who's the greatest Jet ever?
[ct=1691.299] His name came up.
[ct=1692.351] It certainly did.
[ct=1694.013] Darrelle Revis.
[ct=1695.352] This drive starts at the 40, and looking
[ct=1699.523] for space on the inside.
[ct=1700.612] Picking up four or five, is Mostert.
[ct=1703.347] And of course, when you think about the iconic Jet,
[ct=1705.933] it's Joe Namath in Super Bowl III.
[ct=1707.350] Yep.
[ct=1708.608] Called his shot.
[ct=1710.009] Won the game.
[ct=1711.219] Curtis Martin, such a physical and consistent back
[ct=1715.184] for the Jets.
[ct=1717.906] Namath, of course, is honored.
[ct=1719.168] Joe Klecko is also one of the Jets in the Hall of Fame.
[ct=1723.210] The Jets have had a lot of players
[ct=1724.503] who are in the Hall of Fame, but most of them
[ct=1727.170] spent their careers with other teams.
[ct=1729.839] Go ahead.
[ct=1731.123] [players calling to each other]
[ct=1734.013] Second and 6.
[ct=1739.090] Mostert swings at the outside, but gets corralled
[ct=1742.128] at the line of scrimmage.
[ct=1744.446] Taken down there.
[ct=1745.845] Bill McDonald is there, also CJ Mosley.
[ct=1750.025] Third down and 5.
[ct=1752.397] Another player that's known for his ability
[ct=1753.891] to rush the quarterback, watch the rookie here,
[ct=1756.550] their first round pick, Will McDonald, get off this block.
[ct=1760.406] Goes down, and then he doesn't give up.
[ct=1761.665] He's crawling on the ground to make that play.
[ct=1764.368] That really embodies what this Jets defense is all about
[ct=1768.365] and how they play, how they play as a group,
[ct=1771.014] and how hard they play.
[ct=1772.329] It's really the culture that they've created here.
[ct=1777.513] Third and 5.
[ct=1784.228] Flag.
[ct=1784.493] Could be a free play, and it's a pickup of 16
[ct=1790.708] to Waddle to the 44 yard line.
[ct=1793.392] And John Hussey will make it official.
[ct=1798.861] Offside, defense number 95.
[ct=1802.696] That penalty is declined.
[ct=1805.315] Result of the play, first down.
[ct=1806.756] Quinnen Williams, gain of 11 on that play.
[ct=1810.633] First down at the 44.
[ct=1813.293] If you're a Miami fan, the best thing
[ct=1814.636] you saw there is not just the free play and the conversion,
[ct=1818.639] but the protection.
[ct=1819.908] Usually, this ball gets out in a hurry.
[ct=1822.615] In fact, Tua gets it out faster than anybody.
[ct=1824.161] 2.31 seconds an average on his dropbacks.
[ct=1827.894] That time, he had to hold on to that ball
[ct=1830.611] and had the time to do it.
[ct=1833.223] Rolling left, throwing, and juggled and incomplete.
[ct=1838.394] Intended for Tyreek Hill there.
[ct=1839.911] You mentioned how quickly he's getting--
[ct=1842.362] Tua's getting rid of the ball, but almost every quarterback
[ct=1846.385] That's why the defensive linemen, the guys who
[ct=1847.702] live on sacks and make their money on sacks,
[ct=1850.358] are so frustrated now.
[ct=1851.695] Yeah, I mean, every week, we're able to talk to these guys,
[ct=1854.279] and they do get frustrated because you're
[ct=1856.920] seeing more and more offensive staffs trying
[ct=1859.584] to get to this point.
[ct=1860.867] I don't know if anybody's as good.
[ct=1862.201] San Francisco with Brock Purdy and Kyle Shanahan,
[ct=1864.916] obviously similar scheme.
[ct=1866.185] But Tua, because he's just so efficient,
[ct=1868.845] and he has such great footwork, gets it
[ct=1871.331] out quicker than anybody.
[ct=1873.721] Through the middle, inside the 40 yard line goes Mostert.
[ct=1879.041] Jermaine Johnson making the tackle.
[ct=1881.699] Too bad we don't get a chance, today,
[ct=1883.027] to see Devon Achane, that rookie who's got tremendous speed.
[ct=1889.523] He's been hurt.
[ct=1890.894] Played three snaps last week, but inactive today.
[ct=1892.261] Yeah, he's as fast as anybody they have,
[ct=1894.755] and they have four or five guys that can
[ct=1896.575] run with anybody in the league.
[ct=1897.777] Put them all together on one offense, it's tough.
[ct=1901.200] Tough to stop, and then the scheme as well,
[ct=1904.431] with all the presnap movement, and the way
[ct=1905.792] they attack in different ways.
[ct=1908.397] They could be the 4 by 100 relay team in Paris next summer.
[ct=1913.639] Pass over the middle.
[ct=1914.864] That's hauled in at the 32 yard line by Jeff Wilson.
[ct=1919.898] Quincy Williams makes that tackle, and with 11 and a half
[ct=1923.850] to go in the first half, first down.
[ct=1925.172] Again, Tyreek Hill moving.
[ct=1926.657] Watch how it affects the defense and how the safeties react
[ct=1930.429] to his movement, and then we're going to go the other way.
[ct=1932.968] So sometimes, you create matchups
[ct=1935.478] favorably by creating space, by movement to get the ball to 10,
[ct=1939.355] and then other times, at a critical moment,
[ct=1941.990] you move him to catch the eyes of the defense,
[ct=1944.833] and then you find other matchups to your advantage.
[ct=1954.169] To the 30.
[ct=1955.071] Of course, you see a lot of motion, a lot of shifting.
[ct=1958.620] The Dolphins, this year, on 87% of their plays,
[ct=1961.816] that's seven out of eight, have used shift or motion.
[ct=1964.569] And a lot of people might say, why?
[ct=1968.258] Why are they doing that?
[ct=1968.300] And they do it for a number of different reasons.
[ct=1970.921] It creates space, and I've talked
[ct=1973.430] to some of the Jets defenders on the field before the game.
[ct=1976.092] They say it affects our eyes.
[ct=1977.412] It affects our rules.
[ct=1978.765] When you see a movement, it's not just
[ct=1981.219] he's randomly going in motion.
[ct=1982.243] Tyreek Hill is going in full speed motion when he moves,
[ct=1987.089] and it makes you have to adjust and communicate,
[ct=1989.714] and they're trying to create matchups.
[ct=1992.084] Second and 7, a little razzle dazzle here.
[ct=1994.773] They got Mostert coming from the outside,
[ct=1997.286] coming back in, taking the ball to the 26 yard line,
[ct=2001.422] where it'll be third down.
[ct=2003.798] It's funny, you look at, again, McDaniel and on those staffs
[ct=2007.866] with both Shanahans, with Kyle, with Sean McVay in Washington,
[ct=2014.238] and all that.
[ct=2014.429] So all these guys come out of the same breed.
[ct=2019.434] That same tree.
[ct=2020.770] Everybody kind of has their own finesse and their own touch
[ct=2023.446] on how they do it and the pieces they have to work with,
[ct=2027.403] and this offense is about speed and execution.
[ct=2032.703] Third and 6.
[ct=2035.442] They're going to call timeout here at the one.
[ct=2037.510] Yeah, play clock all the way down to one.
[ct=2041.781] Second--
[ct=2041.894] So McDaniel--
[ct=2044.388] Miami.
[ct=2044.446] This will be--
[ct=2047.042] Give me a full body shot if you can, Pierre.
[ct=2049.846] I mean, here he is now.
[ct=2053.710] It's like he wears everything but plus fours on the sideline.
[ct=2060.352] He's got his shoe game going.
[ct=2061.713] This is not your typical head coach attire.
[ct=2065.623] Bill Belichick's not going to come out in that anytime soon.
[ct=2069.600] He's got the shirt coming out.
[ct=2070.970] He's got the whole thing.
[ct=2072.298] I mean, not a fashion plate, but--
[ct=2074.926] Well, I mean, the off white Nike's are pretty strong
[ct=2077.565] play by him.
[ct=2078.935] Very, Very, and he's got the watch.
[ct=2080.254] He's got the glasses.
[ct=2084.450] Not your typically dressed coach.
[ct=2086.875] Not your typical coach, period.
[ct=2089.522] I mean, can you think of somebody comparable?
[ct=2092.227] No.
[ct=2093.650] He is a different cat, but very authentic, very smart.
[ct=2100.209] Third down and 6.
[ct=2103.005] Tua buys time, throws into traffic.
[ct=2106.836] That's Waddle.
[ct=2108.429] Makes the catch and gets taken down inside the 10 yard line
[ct=2112.419] by Mosley.
[ct=2116.142] Little danger in that throw, but it works for 20 yards.
[ct=2118.794] And a first down off a third down play.
[ct=2121.415] Well, here's Waddle, going to work to the outside
[ct=2124.132] and Tua, again, trusts his accuracy and his decision
[ct=2128.061] Good job of stepping up, and it's really
[ct=2129.377] about this defender.
[ct=2130.714] He's occupied by that underneath route by Tyreek Hill,
[ct=2133.388] so he had enough separation there
[ct=2138.705] Waddle bring it in.
[ct=2142.687] First and goal, taking it to the 7 yard line.
[ct=2145.325] Trudging ahead.
[ct=2146.700] Mostert, who's already carried eight times today,
[ct=2151.983] but for only 15 yards.
[ct=2157.278] They lead the entire league in efficiency
[ct=2159.983] down in this red zone area.
[ct=2161.285] It's because they can run the football,
[ct=2162.615] and you have a quarterback that's
[ct=2163.907] good at making quick decisions, converting
[ct=2166.598] 73% of the time for touchdowns.
[ct=2170.716] They're first and points, first in total offense.
[ct=2173.520] They're first in rushing.
[ct=2175.879] The pass here.
[ct=2177.237] Escapes a tackle.
[ct=2178.562] Into the end zone he goes for the game's first touchdown.
[ct=2182.541] Got away from Jordan Whitehead.
[ct=2186.363] Tosses the ball into the stands, and the Dolphins,
[ct=2191.698] an extra point away from a 10-0 lead.
[ct=2194.369] Whitehead's a good player, but I love how they move Hill around.
[ct=2198.378] He's, a lot of times, motioning out of there,
[ct=2199.962] but you got a safety on a running back.
[ct=2202.195] And that running back, in this case,
[ct=2203.498] happens to be the most electrifying player
[ct=2207.372] They move him into the backfield and get that matchup
[ct=2209.980] against the safety Whitehead.
[ct=2209.987] Ooh, you know he got married during the bye week.
[ct=2216.630] Sanders for the extra point.
[ct=2219.246] I hope that's his wife he tossed it to.
[ct=2220.787] We'll find out.
[ct=2224.395] Kaylee, find out.
[ct=2225.670] 8:21 to go to the half.
[ct=2227.062] 10-0 Miami.
[ct=2241.632] Safety in the league, mainly with New Orleans.
[ct=2244.199] So Tyreek knew exactly where she was.
[ct=2246.853] She's in the first row of the end zone,
[ct=2248.788] a little souvenir after getting married during the bye week,
[ct=2252.741] and the Jets to take over at the 25.
[ct=2256.560] And we've got some--
[ct=2258.043] oh, yeah, some wedding photos.
[ct=2260.984] She said she was shocked when he posed the question,
[ct=2264.679] but there it was.
[ct=2266.039] What's better than that?
[ct=2267.380] There's your football and a 10-0 lead.
[ct=2271.541] She's hoping maybe she can get another ball, too,
[ct=2275.217] for the other fans that are up there with her.
[ct=2277.815] I wouldn't--
[ct=2279.072] She might get another.
[ct=2280.415] [interposing voices]
[ct=2280.543] It may happen.
[ct=2281.795] Meanwhile, the Jets trying to get something going.
[ct=2284.401] Boyle 4 of 6, but for only 16 yards in the air,
[ct=2288.392] and looking for some space on the ground.
[ct=2289.751] And getting around the corner and picking up the first down,
[ct=2292.421] and that gets the crowd into it a little bit.
[ct=2295.150] Breece Hall picking up 11.
[ct=2298.992] Well, this is what they want to see from Breece Hall.
[ct=2300.483] He's got that home run ability, but this is the physicality
[ct=2305.657] that they want to see.
[ct=2305.891] It's a good block by 16.
[ct=2306.804] He occupies the safety right there.
[ct=2308.261] Now, he can bounce it, and use that stiff arm right there
[ct=2311.543] to get around the corner.
[ct=2312.826] So he's been running a lot of times as a slasher,
[ct=2315.538] as a young back, and I think as he continues to grow
[ct=2318.352] and shows what he can do, remember, he's 220 pounds.
[ct=2322.304] He's got to be able to run with some power,
[ct=2324.861] and that time, he did.
[ct=2326.257] Now, Dalvin Cook, six years with the Vikings,
[ct=2329.645] a lot of 1,000 yards, near that.
[ct=2332.133] Ball is tipped in the air and incomplete.
[ct=2334.646] Tipped that time by Jaelan Phillips.
[ct=2337.012] We're talking about him all season,
[ct=2339.651] number 15, third year guy, played his college football
[ct=2343.668] at Miami, with a play right there.
[ct=2347.611] He goes after an inexperienced quarterback and disguising it.
[ct=2348.968] Vic Fangio, this is what he can do with his outside linebackers
[ct=2351.789] because they drop, and other times, they bring pressure.
[ct=2355.590] He's lined up here, and at the snap of the ball,
[ct=2358.244] he comes down.
[ct=2358.475] Boyle doesn't see that because of the movement
[ct=2360.946] after the snap catches him by surprise,
[ct=2364.853] almost cost him an interception.
[ct=2367.558] Second and 10.
[ct=2369.036] [inaudible] back in.
[ct=2371.540] To the outside goes the pass.
[ct=2374.382] [inaudible] takes it out to the 43 yard line,
[ct=2378.159] where Jerome Baker makes the tackle.
[ct=2380.789] It'll be third down and 3.
[ct=2382.147] When they throw the ball, they're
[ct=2383.483] having to get the ball out in a hurry.
[ct=2384.769] If you've been watching the Jets,
[ct=2386.138] you know Zach Wilson sacks has been a problem all year
[ct=2390.101] because he holds on to the ball too much.
[ct=2392.736] And this offensive line, you touched on it earlier,
[ct=2395.489] you got some young players and some inexperienced players
[ct=2399.426] up there against a very qualified defensive front.
[ct=2403.417] [calling plays]
[ct=2414.034] Boyle.
[ct=2414.285] Look out, sacked.
[ct=2416.660] 36 ball is out, but he was down.
[ct=2420.657] Play is over.
[ct=2423.321] Christian Wilkins was there for the sack,
[ct=2425.996] so once again, a quick out even though they did pick up one
[ct=2431.306] first down.
[ct=2431.541] Now, he looks left.
[ct=2432.613] He wants to go to the quick out to Brownlee,
[ct=2435.232] but Jalen Ramsey takes that away.
[ct=2436.600] And he just didn't have a response, or an answer to it.
[ct=2439.406] By the time he looks left and decides, wanted the rookie,
[ct=2443.235] he's not there, there's that offensive line concern again,
[ct=2447.250] up front, against big Christian Wilkins.
[ct=2451.184] Morstead, having gotten a lot of exercise,
[ct=2455.179] fourth punt of the half.
[ct=2456.516] Fielded at the 11 yard line.
[ct=2458.080] Barrios brings it back out to the 18.
[ct=2461.879] 6:09 remaining in the opening half.
[ct=2469.777] Tua Tagovailoa having a great season.
[ct=2473.674] Fifth overall pick in the draft a few years back.
[ct=2477.644] You covered him a lot since the time he was,
[ct=2478.992] what, 18 or 19 years old in college.
[ct=2481.711] The evolvement's been pretty interesting.
[ct=2484.546] Hasn't it?
[ct=2485.631] I think as an individual as much as a football player.
[ct=2488.307] I think going to Miami and playing
[ct=2489.527] for Mike McDaniel has really helped him
[ct=2492.752] open up and change as a person.
[ct=2493.892] Growing up in a Polynesian community with his parents,
[ct=2498.104] he was just trying to make his dad proud in every way,
[ct=2502.056] and his parents proud and his--
[ct=2504.563] I think that carried over into Alabama.
[ct=2505.981] And I think, now, you're seeing him really grow up and become
[ct=2509.012] his own person.
[ct=2509.974] I noticed that when you asked him in the first question
[ct=2512.604] on the Zoom.
[ct=2512.800] I heard him answer, and the way he looked, and I just said,
[ct=2515.330] wow, this is such a different guy from who he was not
[ct=2520.250] just early years Alabama.
[ct=2521.829] I'm talking about his rookie year at Miami.
[ct=2524.363] I think he's just grown up.
[ct=2525.727] Yeah, there's no question.
[ct=2527.042] He talked about the Samoan family values,
[ct=2530.990] and there's the family.
[ct=2532.173] Mom and dad are on the left.
[ct=2533.603] His dad wanted him to go to Alabama.
[ct=2537.604] He wanted to go--
[ct=2538.967] Tua wanted to go to USC, but it's honor thy father.
[ct=2541.597] That's right.
[ct=2541.802] And that's how he wound up with Saban.
[ct=2542.942] I'll never forget, I asked him, how did you end up here
[ct=2545.655] at Alabama?
[ct=2546.933] He said, my dad told me I was going to Alabama.
[ct=2548.558] Eva Beach, Hawaii, to Tuscaloosa.
[ct=2550.971] That's a nonstop flight.
[ct=2552.281] Pass is caught up at the 36 yard line.
[ct=2555.110] Jaylen Waddle hauls it in.
[ct=2556.324] And this is the timing that I find fascinating.
[ct=2560.232] Mike McDaniel telling us that the amount
[ct=2562.888] of reps that they put in, watch when he hits his last--
[ct=2566.844] in the drop.
[ct=2568.109] He hits that step.
[ct=2569.400] He anticipates and throws the ball
[ct=2572.116] better on time than any quarterback
[ct=2573.379] that I've seen this year, and it has everything
[ct=2575.914] to do with how his footwork is tied
[ct=2577.662] into the depth of the route.
[ct=2579.958] And Mike McDaniel told us, he said,
[ct=2581.256] a receiver at the top of his route
[ct=2583.886] separates more right as he breaks than at any time.
[ct=2587.880] I mean, that's where they want the football thrown.
[ct=2590.554] Toss here.
[ct=2591.854] Wilson.
[ct=2595.875] So since McDaniel got there last year,
[ct=2597.517] you go back to his first two seasons, 13, and not bad.
[ct=2601.194] I mean, rating 88.8, fairly good,
[ct=2605.108] but look at it since then.
[ct=2606.371] 15 and 8, huge TD interception ratio, 105.7 pass rating.
[ct=2614.345] And again, I think that's a credit to him and his growth,
[ct=2617.021] and I think it's also him fitting into Mike McDaniel's
[ct=2619.672] scheme and going back to that anticipation, his footwork,
[ct=2622.594] getting the ball out early, and having
[ct=2625.003] all these great receivers to throw the football to.
[ct=2631.757] Tua backing up, and he's going to get sacked.
[ct=2635.597] Back at the 30 yard line, held on.
[ct=2638.269] Solomon Thomas and Michael Clemons
[ct=2640.930] are both there in the-- got him in a vise.
[ct=2643.582] Third down after the sack.
[ct=2644.849] The Jets showed man, and they dropped to zone,
[ct=2647.581] and I think they confused Tua.
[ct=2648.919] They didn't have an answer to his left.
[ct=2651.554] Watch him work to his left initially,
[ct=2654.162] and we talked about his footwork.
[ct=2655.518] Usually, the ball is out now, but you
[ct=2656.904] see the linebacker, CJ Mosley, dropping to take it away.
[ct=2660.803] I think that scared him off of it,
[ct=2663.501] and there's the speed up front.
[ct=2664.769] Thomas is able to clean it up at the end.
[ct=2669.227] So third and 15.
[ct=2674.280] Jets with three linemen.
[ct=2676.761] The hands on the ground.
[ct=2677.196] They send four.
[ct=2678.108] A little flip here, and out to the 39 yard line goes Wilson.
[ct=2683.432] So they'll force a punt.
[ct=2684.794] Sauce Gardner making the tackle.
[ct=2689.222] Well, this is the kind of game that I
[ct=2691.135] think the Jets thought they could have,
[ct=2692.500] is getting Miami behind the sticks.
[ct=2696.380] Miami typically dictates things.
[ct=2696.634] They throw on their terms, but with that sack on second down,
[ct=2701.555] they were able to set up a very favorable third
[ct=2704.287] and get off the field.
[ct=2709.357] Jake Bailey to punt.
[ct=2709.527] Xavier Gibson is back, so Bailey's first punt
[ct=2717.306] of the afternoon.
[ct=2727.857] Short, wobbly kick with backspin.
[ct=2731.852] Flag is thrown.
[ct=2733.133] That takes a good bounce.
[ct=2735.779] The ball is loose.
[ct=2737.152] The ball is scrambled around for, but see the flag here.
[ct=2739.769] Meanwhile, you got Bailey down on the ground,
[ct=2741.386] so he's trying to sell it if nothing else.
[ct=2743.664] And there is a flag back there as well.
[ct=2746.324] Irvin Charles came in, number 19.
[ct=2752.812] So it was fourth and 9, and so going over the options here
[ct=2762.137] with McDaniel.
[ct=2764.802] Running into the kicker, receiving team number 19.
[ct=2768.473] That penalty is a five yard foul.
[ct=2770.058] Miami has elected to decline that penalty
[ct=2773.997] and take the result of the play.
[ct=2775.327] Yeah, that was interesting because, had it
[ct=2776.858] been fourth and 4 or something, it
[ct=2779.078] would have been a first down.
[ct=2780.324] Fourth and 9, you only get five, so it's still
[ct=2781.561] going to be fourth and 4.
[ct=2782.910] And they continue to make this Jets
[ct=2784.413] offense work the long field.
[ct=2786.878] You remember, what was the Jets' plan?
[ct=2788.183] They wanted to win with defense, special teams,
[ct=2790.884] try to get a turnover, try to get that short field.
[ct=2793.477] Instead, the entire first half, they've
[ct=2796.205] been deep inside their own territory,
[ct=2798.829] making it tougher and tougher for Boyle
[ct=2800.481] and this offensive line to get anything going.
[ct=2802.822] Yeah, well, the Jets have run 15 plays for 33 total yards.
[ct=2810.787] I think a lot of Jets fans thought, anybody
[ct=2812.069] but Zach Wilson, who got to be that way,
[ct=2814.769] and they're seeing that maybe it wasn't just all on Zach Wilson.
[ct=2818.746] Right now, it's an offensive line
[ct=2820.083] and an inexperienced quarterbacks, both of them,
[ct=2824.425] And mistakes like this.
[ct=2826.721] Almost on cue--
[ct=2829.357] False start, offense number 65.
[ct=2834.679] [kirk stammering]
[ct=2835.999] I was going to say, that's Xavier Newman,
[ct=2837.311] and he was with Tennessee until, I think, around October 2.
[ct=2841.244] They released him.
[ct=2841.557] The Jets pick him up October 5, and now, here he
[ct=2845.078] is starting against the Miami Dolphins on Black Friday.
[ct=2847.970] I mean, he's the right guard.
[ct=2849.242] I mean, so again, it's easy to point the finger at Nathaniel
[ct=2853.186] Hackett.
[ct=2854.360] It's easy to point the finger at Zach Wilson.
[ct=2855.696] But when you have a depleted offensive line,
[ct=2858.333] it's hard on anybody.
[ct=2861.041] So now, first and 15.
[ct=2863.661] That pass is caught.
[ct=2865.024] Nice gain here, 30 yard line.
[ct=2866.517] That's Jason Brownlee, the rookie out of Southern
[ct=2869.081] Mississippi, and we tick down to the two minute warning.
[ct=2874.278] The next play upcoming will be a second down and 3,
[ct=2878.268] and there is your two minute warning.
[ct=2880.979] And here is a special look at Aquaman
[ct=2883.619] and the Lost Kingdom, only in theaters on December the 22nd.
[ct=2891.576] Two minute warning, and a third and short
[ct=2893.272] is upcoming now after Dalvin Cook picks up
[ct=2896.894] Nothing like using Big Whit's back to sign an autograph.
[ct=2901.038] That's about as good as it gets.
[ct=2902.334] It's like a table.
[ct=2904.884] He gets back--
[ct=2906.144] Even the Ten Commandments on his back.
[ct=2908.832] All right, we got a third and short here.
[ct=2910.155] Remember, they were 0 for 11 last week on third down,
[ct=2914.140] and they got a chance here.
[ct=2915.477] They're off to a slow start on these third downs today,
[ct=2919.466] Let's see if they can pick one up.
[ct=2920.766] Yeah, so 0 for 11 last week.
[ct=2923.491] 0 for 4 today.
[ct=2924.734] Third and 1 here.
[ct=2928.742] He sees the blitz coming.
[ct=2932.724] Gets it out, but can he get the first?
[ct=2936.717] [inaudible] tackled there.
[ct=2938.118] Kohou making the stop.
[ct=2940.691] Crowd, of course, hates it.
[ct=2943.396] Dolphins are going to take--
[ct=2946.010] Third and final charged timeout Miami.
[ct=2950.002] Their final to save it.
[ct=2950.015] This will be a 30 second timeout.
[ct=2952.654] So their final timeout--
[ct=2953.977] Reset the game clock to 1:14, please.
[ct=2956.640] 1 1 4.
[ct=2957.964] They're going to have an opportunity for that old two
[ct=2960.640] for one because they're going to get the ball
[ct=2961.946] to start the second half.
[ct=2962.187] Yeah, Boyle, you could see, is frustrated with himself
[ct=2964.601] because he thought he had man coverage,
[ct=2966.215] and instead, with that blitz, they
[ct=2968.589] dropped back and played zone and came off those receivers.
[ct=2972.573] Made a great play there.
[ct=2973.932] Keep them short.
[ct=2975.240] So next--
[ct=2976.168] Presnap movement.
[ct=2976.561] Trying to stretch his defense out.
[ct=2979.186] Trying to create matchups with Tyreek
[ct=2980.574] Hill, a lot of times out in the flat.
[ct=2982.061] Many times, working from outside to in.
[ct=2985.865] It's a great play here.
[ct=2986.103] Just get him the ball in space, get that big offensive line
[ct=2991.362] We'll see what they can do here with a little over a minute.
[ct=2995.160] No timeouts.
[ct=2996.476] 1:05.
[ct=2997.823] Got Waddle setting up slot left, but Hill, bottom of the screen,
[ct=3004.458] wide right.
[ct=3004.579] Tua looks, throws, picked off at the 27 yard line.
[ct=3009.805] Echols touchdown.
[ct=3020.393] Boy, this place has had nothing to cheer about for a long time.
[ct=3024.363] Going wild right now, and why not?
[ct=3027.055] Brandon Echols, the pick 6.
[ct=3032.365] The one area that Tua, and he would be the first one
[ct=3035.223] to tell you this, has hurt his team
[ct=3038.972] has been turnovers in recent weeks.
[ct=3040.561] Talked to us this week about how he's got to play clean.
[ct=3044.311] He can't turn the football over.
[ct=3045.638] Not only does he turn one over before the half,
[ct=3048.386] he throws a pick 6.
[ct=3049.613] We just said, how can the Jets make a game of this?
[ct=3052.403] Their defense.
[ct=3053.564] Ooh, Zuerlein's kick.
[ct=3056.293] Well, you can't have it all, I guess.
[ct=3060.262] Meanwhile, a little deja vu here.
[ct=3062.879] Echols picked off Tua when he was a rookie two years ago.
[ct=3068.138] And he's in for Michael Carter.
[ct=3069.653] He's right here.
[ct=3070.766] He's just kind of reading the eyes of Tua.
[ct=3072.396] I'm not sure, as accurate as Tua is, he went from the slant,
[ct=3077.386] or he thought he would throw.
[ct=3078.789] And without even looking, he thought it was a good checkdown
[ct=3081.381] and a safe throw to get the ball out to the outside to Berrios.
[ct=3085.337] But give Echols credit.
[ct=3086.708] Doesn't sink inside, has a job to see it, but just kind of get
[ct=3090.694] out in the flat playing zone.
[ct=3091.987] Reads the eyes and then steps in front of it.
[ct=3094.674] Walks to the end zone.
[ct=3095.934] See, Tua's slant comes off of it, out
[ct=3097.745] to the flat without even taking a look at Echols,
[ct=3101.484] and Echols makes him pay for it.
[ct=3103.754] And Tua has to say, haven't I seen this before?
[ct=3105.443] Because Echols, as a rookie, had a pick 6.
[ct=3108.854] Echols has had three interceptions--
[ct=3112.626] three interceptions in his career,
[ct=3114.037] and then, of course, as they say, you can't have it all.
[ct=3118.077] And like I said, how do the Jets stay in a game like this?
[ct=3124.603] You got to count on that defense to make plays.
[ct=3127.189] I thought they'd give him some good field position.
[ct=3129.933] This time, they just scored themselves.
[ct=3132.589] Zuerlein's not used to kicking extra points.
[ct=3135.218] Maybe that's the issue.
[ct=3137.867] (LAUGHING) Right.
[ct=3139.203] I couldn't resist.
[ct=3140.521] Up to the 32 yard line on the run
[ct=3141.849] back here with 53 seconds and a flag.
[ct=3158.153] And the Dolphins starting to, for the moment, march back.
[ct=3166.360] John Hussey.
[ct=3175.432] 10 yard penalty.
[ct=3178.062] But when Tua shared with us this system, sometimes, you're
[ct=3182.048] going to throw picks because you trust your receivers,
[ct=3185.036] and you trust the scheme.
[ct=3187.367] And you're going to throw it and throw it early,
[ct=3188.979] and you hope that you're going to be able to make that play,
[ct=3191.426] and you and the receiver are going to be on the same page.
[ct=3195.029] I remember throwing four picks, and Mike McDaniel
[ct=3197.758] coming over to me.
[ct=3198.990] I thought he was going to be upset.
[ct=3200.356] He said, perfect, perfect.
[ct=3200.622] He's like, perfect?
[ct=3201.610] He said, yeah, this is not a result oriented offense.
[ct=3204.364] We're trying to learn the timing and the rhythm of this.
[ct=3206.952] Now, that, was a poor decision where he didn't quite see
[ct=3212.279] Echols and made the throw--
[ct=3213.599] 23 yard line.
[ct=3214.939] It's a 10 yard foul.
[ct=3215.045] The ball will be placed at the 13 yard line.
[ct=3218.941] But I think it tells you about the mindset of how
[ct=3220.652] Mike McDaniel gets inside of Tua and says, hey,
[ct=3225.267] Stay positive and keep believing.
[ct=3227.774] Yeah, he works on every aspect of you as a human being,
[ct=3231.359] as Hill makes the catch, and he'll get out of bounds.
[ct=3234.003] I mean, you talked about it the other day.
[ct=3236.705] We're on the phone with Mike, and he's
[ct=3237.980] talking about people becoming who they really are
[ct=3241.980] and how they get there.
[ct=3243.260] I felt like I was on a couch.
[ct=3244.106] I did, too.
[ct=3248.918] I was fascinated because I've just
[ct=3250.002] seen him with what you see on camera
[ct=3253.818] and some of the personality.
[ct=3256.474] But boy, what a thoughtful guy, and a guy that
[ct=3260.476] has had a big impact on the mindset
[ct=3261.787] of some of these individual players and their approach
[ct=3265.794] to the game.
[ct=3267.061] Unquestionably.
[ct=3268.444] Second down, 8.
[ct=3269.814] 48 seconds.
[ct=3272.404] Quick to the outside.
[ct=3273.762] Caught there, Waddle, who played with Tua at Alabama,
[ct=3279.058] college mates.
[ct=3280.410] Clock keeps running.
[ct=3280.600] They don't have a timeout.
[ct=3283.851] Miami will get the ball to start the second half.
[ct=3285.520] I think it's important to recognize they're probably--
[ct=3289.067] they're not working in turbo speed,
[ct=3290.357] but it just shows you the trust and confidence they
[ct=3291.690] go back to getting the ball to Tua, and letting them throw it.
[ct=3295.113] Yeah, underneath, Jets will give him one or two more of those,
[ct=3299.003] and that'll take us to the half.
[ct=3300.404] Waddle makes that catch.
[ct=3303.003] Get up to the 36 yard line.
[ct=3305.652] Spike it here.
[ct=3308.322] Funny, you see a spike here.
[ct=3309.904] So Dan Marino's on the field.
[ct=3311.012] Talking to Dan before the game, of course, that famous play
[ct=3313.603] where he faked a spike in a Miami Jets game,
[ct=3316.300] and then threw a touchdown to win it.
[ct=3317.591] Who'd he throw that to, Engram?
[ct=3318.929] I think, Mark Engram?
[ct=3320.299] Yeah?
[ct=3322.939] And there he is with Aaron Rodgers before the game.
[ct=3329.587] Two of the greatest ever do it.
[ct=3330.889] Oh, yeah.
[ct=3337.653] Tyreek to the top here.
[ct=3344.200] They're not letting him get free,
[ct=3346.813] and that's caught at the--
[ct=3348.207] just shy of the first down.
[ct=3349.494] Waddle making the grab, 45 yard line,
[ct=3352.144] but he only have nine seconds now.
[ct=3357.570] Trying to get into Sanders field goal range, almost compelled
[ct=3361.417] right now to get it out of bounds.
[ct=3365.530] You don't do that hard to get a completion, a spike,
[ct=3369.184] and a field goal attempt within nine seconds, but we'll see.
[ct=3381.392] First timeout, New York Jets.
[ct=3384.185] Coach want to make sure they are aligned.
[ct=3388.260] Well, start of the game, and I said,
[ct=3392.229] how does a team averaging 15 a game beat a team averaging 31
[ct=3397.628] a game?
[ct=3398.778] Well, a pick 6 helps along the way.
[ct=3400.056] But the Jets, they're trying like crazy
[ct=3404.100] to get something going, but how do they get something going?
[ct=3407.891] That's a great question.
[ct=3409.179] I'm sure it is.
[ct=3409.675] Because they keep getting behind the sticks.
[ct=3411.834] They're starting deep in their own territory with, again,
[ct=3414.422] this offensive line that's having a really tough game.
[ct=3417.526] They've had a tough season with the injuries,
[ct=3419.947] and I think the biggest thing is,
[ct=3422.343] you got to continue to hope that you don't make mistakes.
[ct=3425.111] They've made some.
[ct=3426.543] They're behind the sticks.
[ct=3427.660] You got to keep hoping this defense puts you
[ct=3430.284] in a position to have a shot.
[ct=3431.856] Tua's going to throw it here, and you've
[ct=3435.627] got it-- is that pick again?
[ct=3436.998] This is DJ Reed this time.
[ct=3440.989] DJ Reed, but there's only two seconds on the clock.
[ct=3444.903] But we hear Tim Boyle has a strong arm.
[ct=3447.575] Two seconds left, and answer your question, what do you do?
[ct=3452.668] I mean, it sounds crazy, but this is what you have to do.
[ct=3455.817] You rely on the defense to do this.
[ct=3457.939] In the second half, you got to get turnovers,
[ct=3461.212] You got to give your own offense a chance.
[ct=3464.208] This defense is doing everything every single week
[ct=3468.845] to give their offense some kind of chance
[ct=3473.138] to win a football game.
[ct=3475.067] So two picks in the last 65 seconds.
[ct=3479.712] Jets now have three defenders back inside their 15 yard line.
[ct=3488.469] And we'll see what Boyle--
[ct=3489.542] how far he can throw it if, indeed, he throws it,
[ct=3492.123] or they try a lateral or whatever here.
[ct=3494.534] Meanwhile, he just tries to get away from everybody.
[ct=3497.522] Throws it into the end zone into a lot of traffic,
[ct=3501.173] and there's a pick on the other side.
[ct=3502.492] And coming back from the end zone is Holland,
[ct=3505.206] and Holland is out to midfield, and Holland is inside the 40,
[ct=3510.577] and Holland is inside the 20.
[ct=3512.859] Can you believe this?
[ct=3517.289] That is insanity.
[ct=3529.806] That's as crazy as anything.
[ct=3532.362] you'll ever see.
[ct=3534.664] You're throwing a Hail Mary.
[ct=3537.303] And it's a Hail Mary all right, for the defense.
[ct=3541.235] If there's ever a play that embodies an entire season,
[ct=3545.192] this is it for the New York Jets, a Hail Mary
[ct=3549.515] by your own quarterback.
[ct=3550.346] And I want you to see Holland is one of the best three safeties
[ct=3554.407] in the National Football League.
[ct=3555.692] Right away, he's thinking about, I got a shot.
[ct=3557.542] I mean, the entire way he built up more and more speed.
[ct=3562.016] He left all the skill behind him.
[ct=3563.452] All the receivers are way behind him.
[ct=3565.348] Now you got linemen and one skill guy
[ct=3568.262] in Breece Hall, who gets blocked.
[ct=3569.547] And now you're asking Boyle to try to make a play right here.
[ct=3572.749] And he's got no chance.
[ct=3580.008] Unbelievable play.
[ct=3582.596] Extra point is good.
[ct=3583.655] Crowd doesn't know which way to go right now.
[ct=3586.083] They were ecstatic.
[ct=3587.425] And now they're morose.
[ct=3591.426] 17 to 6.
[ct=3594.012] Yikes!
[ct=3595.409] Kaylee.
[ct=3596.740] Well, coach, two huge plays by your defense to end that half.
[ct=3599.571] But then a crushing one--
[ct=3602.031] --at the end.
[ct=3603.358] And it turned out to be disastrous.
[ct=3604.734] Jets kick off to start the third quarter.
[ct=3611.319] Start with a touchback.
[ct=3612.787] Moments ago, Kaylee with Mike McDaniel.
[ct=3621.252] for a touchdown, how did he do that?
[ct=3624.268] How did he do it?
[ct=3625.922] Well, I think he caught the ball and then relied
[ct=3628.584] You know, he's a great player, hadn't had his hands
[ct=3632.649] on the ball up to this point.
[ct=3635.253] But he's been playing unbelievable.
[ct=3637.142] And we needed it.
[ct=3637.887] And he knew what time it was so.
[ct=3639.212] He made sure to finish the play, which was awesome.
[ct=3641.895] Two interceptions by Tua in the last two minutes.
[ct=3644.518] I know it's a problem he's been trying to eliminate.
[ct=3647.205] What did you guys discuss at the half?
[ct=3648.489] No, I think he's done a good job as of late.
[ct=3652.501] And then when you're going against a really good defense,
[ct=3655.047] that stuff's going to happen, especially
[ct=3657.494] when they have the ball skills.
[ct=3658.801] And so this is a great opportunity
[ct=3660.204] to do what you have to do at the quarterback position, which
[ct=3665.500] and go ahead and keep slinging it because that's what he does.
[ct=3669.461] Thanks, coach.
[ct=3669.726] Appreciate it.
[ct=3672.079] All right, thank you, Kaylee.
[ct=3672.340] Second down and 7 after a 3-yard run
[ct=3674.775] by Jeff Wilson on the first scrimmage
[ct=3678.723] play of the third quarter.
[ct=3682.704] Tua 15 to 23 for 171.
[ct=3686.783] And on second and 7, he slings it out here.
[ct=3689.369] And a nice tackle is made to save a first down
[ct=3692.035] by Ashtyn Davis corralling Jeff Wilson, making it third and 3.
[ct=3700.003] I love that comment by Mike McDaniel
[ct=3702.685] about be a quarterback.
[ct=3704.000] Put that one behind you and move forward.
[ct=3705.310] And I think it had a lot to do with the play calling
[ct=3707.993] after the pick 6.
[ct=3709.268] They were out of timeouts.
[ct=3709.429] And they kept being aggressive and kept trusting Tua.
[ct=3713.261] I think he was sending him a message as much as trying
[ct=3715.981] to get into field goal range there before he
[ct=3718.574] threw his second pick.
[ct=3727.563] Third down and 3.
[ct=3728.961] Going deep.
[ct=3730.257] And it's going to be hauled in.
[ct=3734.182] A flag is down.
[ct=3734.309] Though Waddle making the catch over Gardner.
[ct=3738.207] The flag is down at the 46-yard line.
[ct=3740.872] Dolphins indicate it's against the Jets.
[ct=3743.500] And everybody's moving in that direction.
[ct=3745.184] Brandin Echols just threw down Berrios
[ct=3748.494] I think that's where the flag came in.
[ct=3750.384] Illegal use of the hands, hands to the face, defense number 26.
[ct=3759.979] Here's one of the great matchups we wanted to see is not just
[ct=3762.625] Tyreek Hill, but Jaylen Waddle one on one against the length
[ct=3766.627] of Sauce Gardner at 6'3".
[ct=3768.016] And there's where speed beats that length.
[ct=3770.702] Ball's thrown well.
[ct=3771.844] Slightly has to come back to the football.
[ct=3774.473] But there's the hold that they declined.
[ct=3777.129] But he had such separation there.
[ct=3781.016] Gain of 32.
[ct=3783.643] So Wilson seeing a lot of action here.
[ct=3786.344] Mostert carried eight times for 15 yards.
[ct=3787.643] But Wilson now has carried 8 for 40.
[ct=3791.590] See what Waddle has done with Tyreek Hill now.
[ct=3794.191] Combined they have 13 receptions and 181 yards and a touchdown.
[ct=3799.535] So those two against a talented secondary.
[ct=3803.450] The New York Jets having a good day.
[ct=3810.135] There was Gardner getting beat on the play.
[ct=3812.879] Second down and 7.
[ct=3817.759] Mostert is back in.
[ct=3819.161] And he takes it to the 30-yard line
[ct=3821.876] with the third down coming up.
[ct=3823.080] On third down, today this team is 6 out of 10.
[ct=3828.274] And of course, the Jets are 0 for 5.
[ct=3834.578] Boy, how much fun is it to watch that perimeter
[ct=3837.146] speed against this defense?
[ct=3840.040] DJ Reed on one side.
[ct=3841.546] Sauce Gardner on the other.
[ct=3842.782] Great linebackers and coverage in Quincy Williams
[ct=3846.457] and CJ Mosley.
[ct=3850.480] Going to have to step up here to keep this a two-possession game
[ct=3857.084] on third and 4.
[ct=3859.715] Blitz.
[ct=3861.092] Got him.
[ct=3862.451] Bryce Huff gets the sack.
[ct=3866.397] Put pressure on that time.
[ct=3867.925] It was Ulbricht sending about 6 and get the sack.
[ct=3874.249] Yeah, you bring outside pressure.
[ct=3876.969] You see Williams and Huff.
[ct=3878.102] But when he stepped up, good pressure from the interior.
[ct=3880.913] And that's how you really can take Tua out of his game,
[ct=3884.774] not give him anywhere to be able to step up.
[ct=3886.156] And he's only about six feet, about 6'1".
[ct=3888.739] That time they brought him from everywhere on that third down.
[ct=3892.743] So Sanders now, this will be a 54-yard attempt.
[ct=3899.269] He had a 51 yarder against Vegas last week
[ct=3904.651] to try to make it 20 to 6.
[ct=3906.093] And that kick is right down the middle.
[ct=3912.518] Early third quarter, Dolphins tack on 3 to make it 20 to 6
[ct=3945.643] [audio out]
[ct=3973.624] Turned into a night game.
[ct=3974.919] It is 20 to 6.
[ct=3976.230] Miami on top.
[ct=3977.826] Kick will be run back from the goal line here.
[ct=3982.874] Xavier Gibson, to the outside he goes
[ct=3985.558] and thrust into the Jets bench at around the 27-yard line.
[ct=3992.194] and watch Jevon Holland and what he's
[ct=3993.541] able to do on this Hail Mary.
[ct=3994.826] Jets got a break, got an interception.
[ct=3997.538] Time for one play.
[ct=3998.794] Ball goes up in the air.
[ct=4000.151] All these receivers in the background.
[ct=4001.470] Holland right now, the guy that's
[ct=4002.821] been waiting to have a pick all year, is thinking,
[ct=4005.479] I'm taking this to the house.
[ct=4006.830] Look at Christian Wilkins.
[ct=4008.149] Picks up the only athlete back there.
[ct=4009.505] Breece Hall, the running back, makes the quarterback mix
[ct=4013.547] and goes into the end zone for that touchdown.
[ct=4017.440] And again, you heard his coach say
[ct=4018.733] he's been waiting to come up with a pick, been playing
[ct=4021.445] great.
[ct=4021.684] And he finally comes up with the most memorable play
[ct=4024.353] of this defense they've made all year.
[ct=4026.741] Last guy he had to beat was Boyle.
[ct=4028.073] It went this way and that way, but to no avail.
[ct=4031.947] Breece Hall picking up about 4 to the 31.
[ct=4041.275] So the Jets offense though, we've
[ct=4042.869] been talking about it all game.
[ct=4043.896] I'm sure if you're a Jets fan, you're sick.
[ct=4047.102] You know it.
[ct=4048.163] Five punts and a pick from Nathaniel Hackett.
[ct=4052.152] Well, you got that offensive line
[ct=4056.060] in flux, disarray, whatever you want to call it,
[ct=4061.038] Second down and 6.
[ct=4068.034] Barreling in, Wilkins.
[ct=4071.262] And of course, many thought about that offensive line.
[ct=4073.932] There goes Wilkins just teeing off and feasting on them.
[ct=4076.541] Well, when you run a naked, you're
[ct=4079.105] hoping the defense bites on this action.
[ct=4081.894] You go away from him.
[ct=4084.279] And Wilkins is here.
[ct=4085.636] Action goes away.
[ct=4086.904] You'd think he would have collapsed down.
[ct=4088.396] Instead, he's there with discipline.
[ct=4092.095] And he's quick at his size, not fooled at all.
[ct=4094.705] Keep in mind, that's 310 pounds with lateral quickness
[ct=4098.540] and brings a lot of personality to this defense.
[ct=4102.624] First round pick out of Clemson in 2019.
[ct=4107.563] Third and 15.
[ct=4108.927] Boyle throws a little dart here.
[ct=4112.866] And to the 30-yard line bouncing his way out to the 30
[ct=4115.674] goes Conklin, the tight end.
[ct=4119.554] Oh, the crowd.
[ct=4119.617] Well, they don't know what to do.
[ct=4124.864] Well, they know what to do.
[ct=4126.179] But--
[ct=4128.837] I don't know what the Jets do.
[ct=4130.126] Boy, that guy, he's really upset.
[ct=4136.786] Well, you saw Zach Wilson.
[ct=4138.136] Zach Wilson is active today.
[ct=4139.455] But he would only be in the game if both quarterbacks--
[ct=4143.457] the other quarterback being Trevor Siemian--
[ct=4146.073] and Boyle both got hurt.
[ct=4147.472] That's a new rule.
[ct=4150.052] That's the only way he could play.
[ct=4153.924] 19-yard line.
[ct=4155.270] Berrios dropped it and recovers.
[ct=4161.229] Flag all the way back near the 40-yard line.
[ct=4175.105] Morstead's sixth punt of the game.
[ct=4181.733] And John Hussey.
[ct=4184.375] Little sidebar here.
[ct=4188.256] During the kick, holding, receiving team number 89.
[ct=4192.247] That penalty is 10 yards from the end of the kick.
[ct=4198.679] OK, we're back in 30 seconds.
[ct=4247.508] Dolphins begin this drive from their 8-yard line.
[ct=4254.377] 3 or 4-yard pick up here for a Mostert second down.
[ct=4258.015] I was talking with Frank Smith, the offensive coordinator,
[ct=4260.699] last night just about the game and the offense.
[ct=4262.077] And we were talking a lot about pre-snap movement,
[ct=4264.708] and Tyreek Hill, and Waddle, and all the speed.
[ct=4267.126] And he said, make sure you don't forget,
[ct=4269.782] Mike prides himself on the physicality of this offense.
[ct=4273.766] And we have a sign that hangs up in our locker
[ct=4276.744] rooms that says fast, physical, and elite technique.
[ct=4281.500] So that's a part of their offense
[ct=4282.821] that gets overlooked that they personally take a lot of pride
[ct=4286.872] in.
[ct=4288.352] Just another element to a fantastic offense.
[ct=4292.483] And this will be a third down and 3.
[ct=4294.845] Upcoming now as Raheem Mostert, takes it out
[ct=4297.538] to the 15-yard line.
[ct=4297.865] And if you really study him and watch him,
[ct=4300.163] why the big plays get all the attention, that rhythm that Tua
[ct=4304.158] is able to throw with and their play action
[ct=4306.777] game that they throw the timing of it,
[ct=4308.217] it really is based on being able to threaten those linebackers
[ct=4312.725] with the run game.
[ct=4313.487] And if you get that going, then the complement to that
[ct=4317.492] is the way they're able to marry that play action look.
[ct=4320.086] And it looks so similar to their run game.
[ct=4325.432] Better than 5 to 1 ratio in yardage in Miami's favor.
[ct=4333.388] Only a three-man rush.
[ct=4334.674] And Tua gets it away into traffic
[ct=4336.067] and completes it to the 20-yard line to Tyreek Hill.
[ct=4341.350] And when they stay these third and shorts,
[ct=4344.002] it really puts you in a tough spot
[ct=4345.311] no matter how good you are.
[ct=4346.676] You got a linebacker here.
[ct=4348.002] You got a slot right here.
[ct=4349.284] And watch how there's just a chemistry and an understanding.
[ct=4352.044] Instead of taking that route and taking it out wide,
[ct=4355.974] Tyreek Hill knows he's got to sit in that zone
[ct=4362.365] for that first down.
[ct=4365.046] That left tackle, Terron Armstead, walks off the field.
[ct=4369.558] He'll need a little help on the bench.
[ct=4371.641] Keion Smith comes in to take his place.
[ct=4374.605] Meanwhile, cutting it back and leaning to the 28-yard line
[ct=4379.643] goes Mostert.
[ct=4380.968] Second and short.
[ct=4382.308] And you look on the other side, where the Jets defense
[ct=4386.290] is being asked not just to come up with stops,
[ct=4388.948] but they've got to get turnovers.
[ct=4390.536] And if they can score, as we saw in the first half,
[ct=4392.965] the way their own offense looks, add that on top of everything.
[ct=4397.499] So you wonder how long you can survive as far
[ct=4401.722] as the psychology of the game when your offense just
[ct=4405.671] isn't giving you anything.
[ct=4408.890] Second and 3.
[ct=4413.627] Tua throws.
[ct=4414.992] I'm also thinking, Kirk--
[ct=4416.295] [inaudible] there's an eligible receiver in the area.
[ct=4420.759] If you're that kind of a defense and you're playing all out--
[ct=4429.120] --and the offense is doing nothing.
[ct=4430.800] So if nothing else, they had to make a quarterback change,
[ct=4434.733] I mean, at some point, you kind of lose one side of the room,
[ct=4437.421] won't you?
[ct=4438.710] Yeah, yeah, I think you do.
[ct=4438.791] But I do think getting close to the Jets
[ct=4440.331] this week they have done a really good job of staying
[ct=4445.448] They still are pulling for each other
[ct=4446.845] and trying to believe in each other.
[ct=4449.327] But it's tough.
[ct=4450.713] Little flip here.
[ct=4452.016] That's a first down and more.
[ct=4452.350] There goes the cheetah, as he calls himself, Tyreek Hill.
[ct=4459.920] He walked up to the line of scrimmage
[ct=4461.200] and pressed him, trying to take away these easy throws.
[ct=4463.937] But Hill in motion is just getting his hands on the ball.
[ct=4466.510] Watch to the top left, Jaylen Waddle,
[ct=4469.241] who's known always to make a play.
[ct=4470.572] This time he knows he's got to be able to make a block
[ct=4473.185] to help Tyreek Hill out and takes DJ Reed
[ct=4479.863] get around that corner.
[ct=4485.269] Hill out for a moment.
[ct=4491.755] How much fun is it if you're McDaniel
[ct=4494.439] and you got all these guys, and you got a track
[ct=4497.076] team to make up plays?
[ct=4499.701] That playbook, that playbook has to be off the charts.
[ct=4503.690] Yeah, yeah.
[ct=4505.047] And I just love that with his background,
[ct=4507.674] with Mike Shanahan and Kyle Shanahan,
[ct=4509.024] and what he's been able to build here.
[ct=4511.666] It's unique in what they've been able to put on the roster.
[ct=4516.910] It's his own spin based on what he's
[ct=4519.453] been around, and now the pieces and the quarterback
[ct=4523.420] that he has to work with.
[ct=4526.072] Five minutes left in the third.
[ct=4532.726] Little spin move here.
[ct=4534.048] Wilson is about a yard shy of the first down.
[ct=4537.992] Let's take a look at our Next Gen Stats powered by AWS.
[ct=4541.987] We keep talking about the speed.
[ct=4543.341] And Tyreek Hill at some point this year over 22.
[ct=4548.738] Achane close to 22 a couple times.
[ct=4552.509] I mean, just to put that in perspective, I
[ct=4553.863] mean, look at the average speed per skill position.
[ct=4556.987] I mean, get to 21 and 22.
[ct=4560.294] I was telling you yesterday it's like the difference
[ct=4565.852] a 93 mile an hour fastball.
[ct=4568.930] Big, big difference.
[ct=4573.666] Again, Jet motion.
[ct=4575.086] And a first down, forward progress for Mostert.
[ct=4580.116] Moving the sticks.
[ct=4580.374] Tackled there by Jermaine Johnson.
[ct=4583.967] This drive could not be really any more
[ct=4587.972] than what they want than the way they're executing here.
[ct=4592.252] First down, having some success, second down,
[ct=4594.847] having a little bit of success, staying on schedule.
[ct=4597.515] They're living in that third and 2, third and 3 range.
[ct=4601.231] Converting now 9 of 14 on third downs.
[ct=4605.038] And with the lead eating clock as well.
[ct=4608.275] Drive has consumed the five minutes and 20 seconds.
[ct=4610.912] And that was the 10th play of the drive.
[ct=4613.138] And these are just body blows.
[ct=4614.483] It's one thing to hit an 80-yard play to a Tyreek Hill.
[ct=4618.493] Gets everybody excited in the stands.
[ct=4621.019] And everybody loves the speed.
[ct=4622.371] But if you can sustain a drive like this
[ct=4625.039] against a defense that's already teetering, because of the way
[ct=4628.977] their own offense is playing, again, these
[ct=4630.565] are just body blows to this defense.
[ct=4643.133] Miami running its 57th play.
[ct=4648.322] And the Jets have run 22 plays.
[ct=4652.102] That's Mostert.
[ct=4652.308] Let's go to Kaylee.
[ct=4653.447] Guys, you saw left tackle, Terron Armstead,
[ct=4656.076] come off the field earlier in this drive.
[ct=4657.374] And he hasn't even been examined, as far as we've seen,
[ct=4660.771] by the training staff.
[ct=4664.105] because of a quad injury.
[ct=4665.230] This is only his fifth game this season.
[ct=4667.416] He started the season with an ankle injury
[ct=4670.645] And then he was on the IR because of a knee injury.
[ct=4673.192] Yeah, several years with the Saints, Kaylee.
[ct=4675.728] This team will next play in nine days, sort of a mini bi.
[ct=4682.424] At Washington is their next game, and then Tennessee.
[ct=4685.263] And they get the Jets again in Miami in three weeks.
[ct=4691.824] Mostert.
[ct=4692.810] The Jet defense is right there.
[ct=4694.108] And a flag as they throw him into the bench,
[ct=4697.097] right into the bench at the end of the play.
[ct=4699.578] And that's going to be a personal foul.
[ct=4706.047] Hey, he just hits him late.
[ct=4707.417] It looked like Jermaine Johnson as Mosley was making that play.
[ct=4712.400] They rally to the football, do everything
[ct=4714.923] you need to do against that speed.
[ct=4716.314] And then they hit there.
[ct=4719.060] They also grabbed the face--
[ct=4720.364] they may have grabbed the face mask there.
[ct=4721.573] I don't know if he was out of bounds.
[ct=4723.055] Let's see if the face--
[ct=4724.240] there it is.
[ct=4725.547] Yeah, they got that going on.
[ct=4727.019] He's in bounds on the hit by Johnson.
[ct=4728.495] You can see Mostert saying, hey, he got my face mask.
[ct=4730.912] Personal foul, face mask, defense, number 57.
[ct=4737.546] Got run ended behind the line.
[ct=4738.815] So we'll enforce that 15-yard foul from the previous spot.
[ct=4745.444] So that would have been a fourth and 13.
[ct=4749.054] Instead, don't have to tell you.
[ct=4754.408] Yeah, right.
[ct=4755.647] So 295 total yards for Miami, 50 for the Jets.
[ct=4763.310] Time of possession, 30 minutes to 12.
[ct=4770.672] And this drive now entering it's seventh minute.
[ct=4788.195] Gain of 8.
[ct=4789.809] Under two minutes to go now in the third.
[ct=4792.379] So Miami on its way.
[ct=4793.682] If they can hold on, they'd be 8 and 3, stay on top in the East.
[ct=4797.618] And the Jets would go down to 4 and 7.
[ct=4800.195] Well, you keep talking about the Jets offensive line
[ct=4802.727] and how they've had to work with backups.
[ct=4805.435] Now that Armstead's out and Smith is in,
[ct=4806.729] the left tackle is a backup for Miami.
[ct=4809.175] Their starter, Robert Jones, is out.
[ct=4811.887] So you have Lester Cotton in at left guard.
[ct=4814.497] And their right guard, Hunt, is not playing today.
[ct=4818.462] So they right now have three backups themselves playing.
[ct=4821.758] And yet it's not really slowing the efficiency or the execution
[ct=4827.818] Not at all.
[ct=4829.108] Second down and 2.
[ct=4831.623] And now you got Austin Jackson.
[ct=4836.802] He was moving.
[ct=4838.077] False start, offense number 33, [inaudible] 73.
[ct=4843.581] 5-yard penalty.
[ct=4850.033] That the only way you can stop them at this point.
[ct=4854.059] But then again, you got to hand it to the Jets defense.
[ct=4858.019] Doing the job.
[ct=4859.332] Well, they're trying to prevent, obviously, the explosive play.
[ct=4863.232] And you can't take everything away.
[ct=4864.796] Try to keep it top on the defense with your safeties back
[ct=4868.514] and try to rally to the football in front of you.
[ct=4873.743] The defense have held the offense
[ct=4875.019] to 13 points for this juncture, as Hill makes that catch.
[ct=4880.761] And coming up will be the 14th play
[ct=4884.615] of this drive, which started back at their own 8-yard line.
[ct=4888.635] And if you keep safeties back to protect yourselves
[ct=4891.272] against those one-on-one matchups-- the few times
[ct=4895.310] we've seen the one-on-one matchups,
[ct=4896.666] whether it's been in the slot throwing
[ct=4897.918] the ball to Waddle downfield or to even Hill when
[ct=4900.440] he had his chance one on one, they're going down field.
[ct=4903.135] And when you sit back with that too-high look,
[ct=4906.649] they're just kind of dinking and dunking underneath.
[ct=4909.305] But even that, they rely on the yards after the catch.
[ct=4918.530] And that'll convert another third down play.
[ct=4921.143] Hill making the grab.
[ct=4922.533] Reed is right there to tackle him along the sideline.
[ct=4926.327] And that might be the final play of the third frame.
[ct=4930.117] How about that timing between Tua on that third down
[ct=4934.111] and Tyreek Hill?
[ct=4935.477] Tyreek Hill had to work to get open and finally does.
[ct=4939.458] And Tua puts it right on him for another--
[ct=4942.065] This is a first down from the 13 yard line for Miami.
[ct=4946.087] Long, long drive continues with a touchdown.
[ct=4950.078] Mostert taking it in.
[ct=4956.419] 13 yards.
[ct=4957.926] They ran 15 plays over nine minutes
[ct=4965.493] to go up by three scores.
[ct=4966.772] Remember how I told you they pride themselves
[ct=4968.765] on the execution?
[ct=4970.687] Watch the right side here, Austin Jackson, Smythe
[ct=4973.396] do a good job, Cracraft the receiver.
[ct=4975.999] Got a tight end coming around in Hill.
[ct=4978.624] That's just everybody doing their job
[ct=4981.105] and letting a back with good speed
[ct=4982.439] and some quickness and vision just get into the end zone.
[ct=4986.307] But that was all the execution and the blocking
[ct=4988.979] on that right side.
[ct=4990.287] Extra point by Sanders making it 27-6 and a flag, couple.
[ct=4998.252] They got frustration taken over.
[ct=5000.963] You got hats flying.
[ct=5002.253] You got flags flying.
[ct=5014.068] And the peace party coming in.
[ct=5024.654] That's when you know frustration really
[ct=5026.134] sets in, on an extra point.
[ct=5036.529] Fisher, the umpire, losing his flag and his hat.
[ct=5049.809] That's Carl Paganelli, the long time official.
[ct=5054.910] Carl looks like he may have gotten in there and--
[ct=5057.625] Yeah, I think so.
[ct=5058.900] There's Quinnen Williams going airborne and comes down.
[ct=5068.189] I think the umpire may have taken a shot there.
[ct=5070.855] Yeah, he may have been in the wrong place at the wrong time.
[ct=5077.536] There are two fouls on the play, both by the New York Jets.
[ct=5082.801] foul, unnecessary roughness, number 57.
[ct=5086.811] Also, we have a foul against an official, personal foul,
[ct=5092.124] number 72.
[ct=5094.794] Both of those fouls will be enforced because the second one
[ct=5098.895] was a foul against an official.
[ct=5102.641] So the first one's on Moseley.
[ct=5103.902] The second one-- and there's Paganelli, who needs the towel.
[ct=5107.917] Clemons is the guy who made contact with him.
[ct=5115.819] And they will settle down.
[ct=5123.823] Oof.
[ct=5127.927] There are Tua's numbers, very efficient,
[ct=5131.619] except for the two picks, which came at the end.
[ct=5133.598] One was a pick 6.
[ct=5135.615] Hill, 102 yards on nine grabs and a touchdown.
[ct=5139.498] And Holland, of course, with that spectacular,
[ct=5142.130] unbelievable, off the charts insane
[ct=5148.019] You know what's great about him making that play is, again,
[ct=5150.585] he didn't have a pick.
[ct=5151.944] And a lot of times people associate having a great year
[ct=5154.573] with interceptions.
[ct=5154.616] But he has that big play to get the attention.
[ct=5157.209] And there's the Jackson and Clemons
[ct=5159.893] who were involved in that extra point.
[ct=5163.893] Clemons is going to get thrown out here.
[ct=5165.180] He wasn't trying to hit the umpire.
[ct=5167.912] There he's pointing to one of the Jets,
[ct=5170.511] And you some spitting up blood when we went to commercial.
[ct=5177.147] Right away he said, oh man.
[ct=5179.880] He's gone.
[ct=5181.178] Meanwhile, now you to kick off from the 50-yard line.
[ct=5186.478] So what do you want to do, bouncing ball,
[ct=5189.091] easy touch back here?
[ct=5190.440] Clemons to the locker room.
[ct=5191.730] They send that one halfway to Secaucus.
[ct=5195.793] And the Jets will take over at the 25-yard line.
[ct=5201.066] Well, for the Jets, they won on opening night,
[ct=5203.901] even though Rodgers got hurt.
[ct=5205.083] Then they lost three in a row.
[ct=5206.379] Then they won three in a row.
[ct=5207.680] But now they've lost-- if they lose this one,
[ct=5210.383] it'll be four straight.
[ct=5211.676] Yeah, when they won those three in a row,
[ct=5213.002] I think a lot of people thought, OK, hey, just kind of hang out,
[ct=5217.003] just hang in there.
[ct=5217.244] Aaron Rodgers, you don't know if he's going to come back.
[ct=5219.353] You don't know if he's not going to be able to come back.
[ct=5221.981] And then they lose three in a row, on their way
[ct=5224.670] to four in a row.
[ct=5224.983] And a lot of that energy is now in the past.
[ct=5228.671] Aaron was saying relax, as he said in Green Bay.
[ct=5231.305] But nothing to relax about.
[ct=5233.947] And stop the presses, that's a first down
[ct=5236.722] on a pass to Breece Hall.
[ct=5238.124] That is only the third first down for the Jets,
[ct=5243.251] as you look at Rodgers.
[ct=5243.413] One was on a Breece Hall run, that one on a pass.
[ct=5247.394] And the other was by a penalty.
[ct=5251.209] Biggest gain of the night.
[ct=5256.939] Pass is caught.
[ct=5257.067] And then that's Garrett Wilson.
[ct=5259.550] Jalen Ramsey, who's been really good, he came back.
[ct=5263.562] He was hurt, missed the first part of the season, has had
[ct=5267.559] three picks, a couple last week.
[ct=5269.559] Well, of course, with that Jets offense,
[ct=5272.009] they're not throwing at anybody tonight.
[ct=5273.299] No, it's just great to see him back.
[ct=5276.019] And they said the work that he's put in practice,
[ct=5277.396] not just with his first team defense,
[ct=5278.833] but with his scout team just to get into game shape.
[ct=5282.602] Second and 1.
[ct=5285.423] And sliding to a stop.
[ct=5289.258] Crowd wants a flag for a late hit.
[ct=5291.920] Won't get it.
[ct=5292.008] That's Jaelan Phillips coming in,
[ct=5294.617] as Tim Boyle gets back to just about the line of scrimmage
[ct=5298.546] after that.
[ct=5298.594] That was a win just to get back to the line of scrimmage.
[ct=5302.540] Second one.
[ct=5303.934] I thought he was about to get sacked by Wilkins.
[ct=5306.539] And instead, he only loses a yard or two.
[ct=5309.184] But gives him a chance here on third down.
[ct=5311.731] Still trying to convert their first third down of the night.
[ct=5317.058] Spot where he started to slide, so third and 3.
[ct=5321.018] And that is caught.
[ct=5322.404] But tackled short of the first down is Breece Hall.
[ct=5327.677] DeShon Elliott making the stop.
[ct=5331.650] Utter frustration on the field, in the crowd.
[ct=5338.323] Fourth down.
[ct=5339.819] They'll go for it.
[ct=5340.958] Yeah, great play there by Elliott working through traffic
[ct=5343.586] to make that play.
[ct=5358.181] So a fourth and 2 is now going to be a fourth and 7.
[ct=5360.896] False start, offense, number 67, five-yard penalty.
[ct=5367.503] Carter Warren.
[ct=5369.017] Rookie out of Pitt who got his first action last week.
[ct=5374.286] If it's not one guy, it's another.
[ct=5376.803] We've seen the right guard who's trying to work himself--
[ct=5379.534] Newman-- into this rhythm of this offense
[ct=5383.461] have some penalties this time again.
[ct=5384.792] It's the beat goes on to the Jets offense, not just today,
[ct=5387.426] but for the last four or five weeks.
[ct=5391.407] Fourth and 7 now.
[ct=5396.739] And that's fired up at the 50-yard line and hauled in.
[ct=5403.387] Tyler Conklin making the grab there.
[ct=5408.705] Well, they can't convert on third down.
[ct=5410.020] But they convert here on a fourth down.
[ct=5415.339] 0 for 7 on third.
[ct=5415.543] One for one on fourth.
[ct=5416.672] Best thing he did is got the ball out quick that time.
[ct=5420.660] Gets it out quick this time because he was pressured.
[ct=5423.374] That's incomplete.
[ct=5427.290] There's so many pieces to the Dolphins defense that get
[ct=5429.988] overlooked.
[ct=5431.308] Wilkins I know can make a lot of plays in the inside.
[ct=5432.623] I think David Long, 51, along with Van Ginkel, what
[ct=5436.592] they brought to the middle--
[ct=5437.950] Van Ginkel is an outside linebacker,
[ct=5440.173] has never played middle linebacker in his career.
[ct=5442.867] But Vic Fangio said, I just have a gut
[ct=5445.365] feeling that this kid can help us and get him
[ct=5448.015] on the field with Jaelan Phillips
[ct=5449.360] and Bradley Chubb on the outside.
[ct=5450.681] So this is a unit that's really coming together
[ct=5454.743] in recent weeks.
[ct=5459.991] Down he goes at the 43-yard line.
[ct=5464.018] Raekwon Davis will get that sack.
[ct=5471.981] So third down and 16 now.
[ct=5473.450] That's the fourth sack of the game for the Dolphins.
[ct=5477.222] And the beautiful thing is you get pressure.
[ct=5479.904] Davis gets the sack.
[ct=5481.209] But how about the pressure on the outside
[ct=5483.954] by Phillips and Ogbah?
[ct=5486.526] Third down, 15.
[ct=5489.170] A little dump off here.
[ct=5490.620] And getting within a couple of yards of picking up
[ct=5494.529] the first down is Dalvin Cook, first year here
[ct=5498.626] after six years in Minnesota.
[ct=5501.158] So you got fourth down.
[ct=5503.768] So again, no third down conversion.
[ct=5505.278] We'll try for four.
[ct=5506.476] Why not?
[ct=5510.393] Fourth and call it 3.
[ct=5519.599] Five wide.
[ct=5522.327] Spinning away to the 35-yard line goes Garrett Wilson.
[ct=5527.848] There you go.
[ct=5528.928] Shows you again Boyle hadn't played a lot of football.
[ct=5531.567] But he feels this blitz and knows
[ct=5533.035] he's got that quick hot to Garrett Wilson.
[ct=5536.897] So easy execution.
[ct=5538.267] But it's just a recognition of that coming
[ct=5541.063] and having an answer for it.
[ct=5542.179] First time that the Jets have been in Dolphins territory
[ct=5546.507] tonight on this drive.
[ct=5548.716] Caught here by Jeremy Ruckert.
[ct=5552.561] So they finally do get something going.
[ct=5557.096] And really, that's the area that I
[ct=5559.105] think they had the most confidence in.
[ct=5560.368] The style of defense Miami plays is
[ct=5561.805] trying to find those tight ends between those linebackers.
[ct=5567.089] --short of the line to gain.
[ct=5570.221] OK, so they have to reposition the sticks.
[ct=5573.570] It'll be second down and short.
[ct=5576.709] They had initially moved them as if it were a first down.
[ct=5585.233] Administrative stoppage here, as they call it.
[ct=5592.624] Game clock operator, please set the game clock to 10:52 please,
[ct=5596.527] 10:52 because we had to reset the ball.
[ct=5599.357] We'll put the clock back in the status
[ct=5601.746] that it was when the runner was down.
[ct=5604.202] The clock will start on my ready signal, please.
[ct=5606.873] OK, where time stands still.
[ct=5610.704] Gets the second down and inches now.
[ct=5623.922] Gets it away.
[ct=5625.122] Ball comes out.
[ct=5625.404] And they're going to rule that incomplete.
[ct=5627.827] And taking that shot there was Ruckert from Elliott.
[ct=5635.218] Tony, these two safeties each week
[ct=5637.866] get better and better with their communication
[ct=5640.168] and how hard they'll hit you when they get downhill.
[ct=5643.176] And a lot of times, Holland will sit back in center field.
[ct=5647.174] Elliott will come down into the box.
[ct=5648.523] He gets there just in time to separate that football.
[ct=5655.039] And the quarterback sneak.
[ct=5657.594] And they finally convert on third down.
[ct=5663.992] Well, again, it was 0 for 11 last week.
[ct=5667.809] And it was 0 for 8, 19-3.
[ct=5674.388] Going into the tent right now for Miami, that's
[ct=5679.595] Lester Cotton, the left guard.
[ct=5683.597] Austin Jackson has already been thrown out.
[ct=5686.422] Ball is loose.
[ct=5687.547] And that time it is ruled incomplete,
[ct=5691.583] as Van Ginkel pops Garrett Wilson.
[ct=5695.603] Second down and 10.
[ct=5695.760] They keep working the middle there and for good reason.
[ct=5699.494] You have quickness in Wilson.
[ct=5700.884] We've seen two tight ends try to get in there, Wilson trying
[ct=5703.512] to get away from Jerome Baker.
[ct=5706.034] That bobble gives Baker a chance to catch up to it
[ct=5710.063] and knock it away.
[ct=5716.684] The flip, short gain.
[ct=5718.138] Breece Hall.
[ct=5719.367] The Jets had run 22 plays before this drive.
[ct=5724.678] They've now run 14 on this run.
[ct=5727.091] There's Phillips down on the turf.
[ct=5732.381] So third down, third and 9, as they
[ct=5736.376] look at the pass rusher, Jaelan Phillips.
[ct=5740.355] And we'll be back.
[ct=5765.510] --and retiring from football and coming back and off
[ct=5769.503] on the cart.
[ct=5770.817] Meanwhile, as this drive continues,
[ct=5772.141] you've got action up front.
[ct=5773.484] And they'll blow this one dead.
[ct=5776.168] Emmanuel Ogbah took over for Phillips.
[ct=5780.091] That was a third and 9.
[ct=5787.951] Who moved first is the question.
[ct=5790.615] Neutral zone infraction, defense number 91, five-yard penalty.
[ct=5796.075] Yeah, that's Ogbah, who just came into the game.
[ct=5798.579] And I think depending on the severity
[ct=5800.190] of that injury to Phillips, if he
[ct=5802.592] is down for an extended period of time, Andrew Van Ginkel,
[ct=5805.236] 43, who we talked about his versatility outside
[ct=5809.244] and can play off ball inside linebacker, he
[ct=5810.721] and 91, Ogbah, will be the two that will have to step up there
[ct=5815.865] to help out if Phillips is down.
[ct=5820.127] Third and 4.
[ct=5822.540] 15th play of the drive.
[ct=5823.900] Now you got Boyle being spun around.
[ct=5827.861] You got a flag down.
[ct=5829.116] You got everything going on there.
[ct=5830.484] Jerome Baker that time.
[ct=5833.116] I think that's on the quarterback.
[ct=5834.447] He was expecting the ball and moved.
[ct=5838.551] We'll see who they call it on because you
[ct=5841.096] Baker coming across.
[ct=5842.455] Flag thrown.
[ct=5843.701] But I think Baker's reacting as much to Boyle there.
[ct=5847.734] He started to skate on his way in.
[ct=5858.392] There are two fouls on the play, one by each team.
[ct=5861.050] Offside, defense number 55.
[ct=5864.828] Holding, offense number 66.
[ct=5867.789] Those penalties will offset.
[ct=5869.905] Replay third down.
[ct=5870.904] Yeah, back whence we began.
[ct=5896.036] Brush for, throw it underneath, and close to a first down.
[ct=5902.702] And picking it up, Breece Hall.
[ct=5905.539] Honestly, this is, I think, the kind of drive
[ct=5909.292] that they envisioned.
[ct=5909.411] When we talked with him this week,
[ct=5912.008] they thought that there's a really good chance
[ct=5914.654] the ball was going to get out.
[ct=5915.988] Get it out in those quick slants.
[ct=5917.256] Get it out to Breece Hall against a linebacker.
[ct=5921.280] Your two playmakers are Breece Hall and Garrett Wilson.
[ct=5923.943] Those are the guys you know what they can do.
[ct=5927.922] Dribs and drabs.
[ct=5929.378] They had two first downs all night coming into this drive.
[ct=5933.212] They've had five on this drive.
[ct=5937.215] And another sack.
[ct=5939.924] Zach Sieler comes in and takes him down.
[ct=5945.181] And that'll be a handful.
[ct=5946.671] Five sacks tonight for the Dolphins.
[ct=5949.446] Yeah, he looks right.
[ct=5950.507] He doesn't have anybody open.
[ct=5953.130] And he doesn't have a checkdown.
[ct=5954.498] So he has nothing to do with his football.
[ct=5955.829] And we've seen this a lot this year with this Jets offense.
[ct=5959.768] Quarterbacks primary, even second
[ct=5961.106] read not there and just has to eat it.
[ct=5971.688] Up in the air, deflected, intercepted, Dolphins ball.
[ct=5980.932] So on the 17th play of a 7-minute drive,
[ct=5984.905] Jerome Baker with the pick.
[ct=5987.567] 7:54 left in the fourth.
[ct=5991.550] Dolphins up by 21.
[ct=5993.194] --the season only on Prime Video.
[ct=5996.897] So now, Miami comfortably in front.
[ct=6002.194] You got Darrynton Evans, who just came off
[ct=6004.832] the list, practice list.
[ct=6006.488] So Mike McDaniel tells us a story today.
[ct=6008.820] We're talking to him.
[ct=6010.203] And I said, tell me a Sacramento Mountain Lions story,
[ct=6012.806] the United Football League, 2010.
[ct=6015.489] He's the running backs coach.
[ct=6018.097] They blow out Omaha.
[ct=6019.439] They go to a nightclub to celebrate.
[ct=6022.106] One of the running backs that he coaches is dancing with a girl.
[ct=6025.964] And Mike says, listen, you're not dancing with her anymore
[ct=6029.971] or you're not playing with his team next year.
[ct=6032.647] So the guy said, well, what can I do?
[ct=6035.288] So then McDaniel starts dancing with her.
[ct=6037.917] That's the beginning of the story.
[ct=6043.289] Again, Evans.
[ct=6044.555] So the bottom line, where am I leading?
[ct=6048.426] Yeah, this is--
[ct=6051.223] Four years later, they're married.
[ct=6053.864] Katie, that's how he met her.
[ct=6056.529] Hey, you, get off.
[ct=6057.864] I'm dancing with her.
[ct=6060.168] Unbelievable.
[ct=6061.838] Courtship.
[ct=6063.196] He is--
[ct=6064.484] He is fantastic to talk to.
[ct=6068.481] That's an all time story.
[ct=6068.713] His owner didn't even know that.
[ct=6071.173] I don't think anybody's heard that story.
[ct=6072.480] I told Steven Ross before.
[ct=6073.781] He said, that's the best story I've ever heard.
[ct=6076.437] And there they are, the McDaniels.
[ct=6087.260] Fumble.
[ct=6088.300] Jets think they have it.
[ct=6089.831] And coming away with it is Ashtyn Davis.
[ct=6093.607] The ruling on the field is a fumble.
[ct=6095.092] You just said Evans just came over.
[ct=6096.598] Recovered by the defense.
[ct=6098.883] There's a miscommunication, which we've not seen a lot of.
[ct=6101.596] And if you're concerned about Miami,
[ct=6103.045] they're going to score on a lot of people they play.
[ct=6105.607] They're going to be a tough out.
[ct=6106.898] This is the concern, the execution,
[ct=6109.598] the potential to turn the football over.
[ct=6112.203] We've talked a lot about the Jets turning it
[ct=6114.863] over and hurting themselves.
[ct=6115.054] Miami's got to avoid that as they get ready
[ct=6117.787] for the stretch run.
[ct=6125.642] --dropped back five times.
[ct=6127.083] They actually have gotten pressure on him.
[ct=6129.501] And look how fast he's getting it out, 2.1 seconds on average.
[ct=6134.840] So it's the Next Gen Stats powered by AWS.
[ct=6140.732] Well, the Jets have it at the 35.
[ct=6142.674] And an errant throw here intended for Breece Hall.
[ct=6150.901] We were kind of--
[ct=6152.246] I don't want to say having fun.
[ct=6153.240] But we were pointing out there third down how inept
[ct=6155.964] they were last couple of weeks.
[ct=6157.258] It's been the case all year.
[ct=6158.577] They're right around 23% on third downs.
[ct=6161.147] It's the lowest conversion rate in 50 years in the NFL.
[ct=6167.956] Yeah, I mean, it's numbers upon numbers
[ct=6170.697] when you look at that offense.
[ct=6171.381] And you wonder in nine days, do you go back to Tim Boyle?
[ct=6177.193] Do you go to Trevor Siemian?
[ct=6178.464] Do you bring Zach Wilson back?
[ct=6180.473] I don't know.
[ct=6180.662] I'm not sure you do that.
[ct=6183.314] I don't think that's going to happen.
[ct=6184.653] No, probably not.
[ct=6187.362] 28 yard line.
[ct=6188.675] Catch made there.
[ct=6191.462] That's Brownlee.
[ct=6194.122] Well, guys, after seeing Dolphins linebacker Jaelan
[ct=6196.668] Phillips carted off the field, we are told it is his Achilles.
[ct=6200.679] And of course, he is out for the game.
[ct=6203.255] Oh, and a lot longer.
[ct=6207.218] That's a big hit.
[ct=6208.530] You obviously wish him well.
[ct=6208.890] And for the Dolphins defense, it's
[ct=6212.444] going to be a big loss down the stretch of this season.
[ct=6216.382] Catch made inside the 20.
[ct=6220.367] These formations that they're using--
[ct=6223.075] It's Holland who's down, by the way.
[ct=6226.508] That's another great player you'd like to see get up.
[ct=6230.538] Big collision there.
[ct=6233.639] You always worry about defensive players lowering their head
[ct=6237.244] here.
[ct=6237.585] This is why you have those rules.
[ct=6241.129] 5:39 left.
[ct=6242.647] Injury timeout.
[ct=6245.368] 11 and 3, as they get ready for Cowboys, Ravens, and Bills.
[ct=6250.303] Week 17 could be a heck of a match-up in Baltimore
[ct=6252.921] with Miami and Baltimore.
[ct=6254.296] That could determine home field.
[ct=6256.838] Meanwhile, to the end zone.
[ct=6258.145] And that pass, is it holding?
[ct=6260.844] Close.
[ct=6262.100] Garrett Wilson.
[ct=6264.791] Trying to hold in.
[ct=6265.171] Well covered there.
[ct=6266.090] You got Elliott back there, Kohou as well.
[ct=6268.765] Offside, defense number 51, 5-yard penalty.
[ct=6274.060] And that was a free play as it turned out.
[ct=6276.748] I think Kohou got his hand in there
[ct=6278.258] at the end of this play four.
[ct=6279.407] Watch him work to get that left hand and eventually--
[ct=6283.585] and maybe the ground also.
[ct=6285.169] Just the force of coming down.
[ct=6287.383] Wilson is known for his ability to elevate,
[ct=6290.305] body control, ball skills.
[ct=6292.714] But eventually, they just pull it away from him.
[ct=6295.330] Could not complete the process of that catch.
[ct=6298.320] First and 5.
[ct=6301.953] To the 9-yard line.
[ct=6303.322] A few of our fine feathered friends
[ct=6305.943] were excited about that because there is, as you know,
[ct=6309.911] there's always something in play.
[ct=6311.264] Always something in play near the end here.
[ct=6312.396] Always something for people who can spare a Bitcoin or two,
[ct=6316.566] of crypto.
[ct=6319.232] And you know what I mean.
[ct=6320.742] Second down and 1.
[ct=6324.560] And that is going to be caught at the 1-yard line.
[ct=6328.848] That's Xavier Gibson, the kick returner, to get it to the 1.
[ct=6334.873] Hurrying up to the line of scrimmage.
[ct=6343.717] Can they get an offensive touchdown?
[ct=6347.504] What do you know?
[ct=6348.879] Touchdown.
[ct=6356.769] So after the turnover, they go 35 yards, six plays in 1:48.
[ct=6365.358] Actually, Miami had a bust on this.
[ct=6367.842] And if he wanted to, he could have thrown to 82.
[ct=6370.501] Watch both corners run with Garrett Wilson.
[ct=6374.416] He's all alone there to the left.
[ct=6375.709] But instead, he takes the hard way
[ct=6377.029] and still throws a touchdown pass.
[ct=6379.677] Their 10th offensive touchdown in this their 11th game.
[ct=6385.106] And for those of you who we talked about earlier,
[ct=6387.556] the all important extra point is good, by Gregg Zuerlein.
[ct=6392.859] 4:37 remaining in the fourth quarter at MetLife.
[ct=6399.433] 27-13, Miami.
[ct=6403.307] History of the National Football League.
[ct=6404.662] Meanwhile, onside kick attempt here
[ct=6405.197] from Morstead, who in the Super Bowl
[ct=6408.398] had a successful onside kick when he
[ct=6411.152] was a Saint, but not this time.
[ct=6412.566] Dolphins with Duke Riley covering
[ct=6415.131] it to retain possession here.
[ct=6424.366] So 27-13, 4 and 1/2 to go.
[ct=6428.388] See that number down at the bottom left?
[ct=6429.752] With Tua, it looks like a good night.
[ct=6431.062] And then again, you see those two interceptions.
[ct=6433.691] That is going to be the focal point for this Miami team,
[ct=6437.968] as we just talked about who they have coming up next three weeks
[ct=6441.709] and trying to get maybe that one seed.
[ct=6443.145] You got to eliminate those turnovers.
[ct=6448.311] The Dolphins trying to chew some clock here.
[ct=6456.270] It'll be second down.
[ct=6457.628] Timeout taken by the Jets.
[ct=6464.253] Well, guys, you know Aaron Rodgers had his Achilles
[ct=6466.886] repaired 10 weeks ago using--
[ct=6468.224] --and [inaudible] electrons of course,
[ct=6469.601] has built a fantastic reputation and very deservedly so.
[ct=6474.872] I swear half the NFL injured reserve list is under his care.
[ct=6481.540] Mostert gets taken down.
[ct=6482.978] By the way, lest anybody throw me
[ct=6485.507] out of the stadium for the Jets since I've
[ct=6487.007] did the butt fumble game--
[ct=6489.505] It's on you.
[ct=6490.807] But I did do the miracle at the Meadowlands--
[ct=6492.450] went back to the hotel.
[ct=6493.502] The next day he's the big story on headline news.
[ct=6497.472] He had that vision.
[ct=6498.772] That's another all time memory.
[ct=6500.264] Right.
[ct=6504.086] It's a first down here for Mostert.
[ct=6505.438] You've called a lot of these games that are just--
[ct=6508.115] people are going to remember that interception
[ct=6510.718] for a long time.
[ct=6512.102] And for the wrong reasons.
[ct=6513.369] Well, the back to back pick sixes.
[ct=6516.044] One on top of another.
[ct=6521.380] At half.
[ct=6522.691] And the way the Jets have looked these last couple
[ct=6524.025] series, that's kind of game that they thought it could be.
[ct=6529.357] They were hoping.
[ct=6537.569] Big hole.
[ct=6538.799] Going to the end zone.
[ct=6542.049] Icing on the cake.
[ct=6543.015] Touchdown Mostert.
[ct=6551.931] Off he goes for 34 yards.
[ct=6557.208] I keep talking about these backups
[ct=6558.564] and how often it's poor execution when
[ct=6562.626] the backups come in.
[ct=6563.933] Watch Liam Eichenberg, who's known really as a tackle,
[ct=6566.769] do a really good job of just sustaining that.
[ct=6569.501] And when you have a back like Mostert, who's got
[ct=6572.572] speed, what he also has is he gets lateral, uses his vision.
[ct=6577.868] And then he's got the burst.
[ct=6579.209] And it allows all those linemen be able to secure those blocks
[ct=6581.834] and move that defensive line laterally.
[ct=6584.480] And then he sneaks through that, finds
[ct=6587.221] that crease for a touchdown.
[ct=6589.803] Extra point by Sanders to make it 34-13, Dolphins.
[ct=6595.127] And back we come in 30 seconds.
[ct=6625.690] With 3 and 1/2 to go.
[ct=6628.639] 34-13, Miami.
[ct=6634.917] So perhaps the beginning of a new NFL tradition, a Black
[ct=6638.906] Friday game.
[ct=6643.080] Games.
[ct=6644.243] Rolling through my head right now,
[ct=6645.612] the Beatles, Eight Days a Week.
[ct=6646.871] Fortunately, there's just seven.
[ct=6648.221] Lookout, down he goes here.
[ct=6652.209] That was Ogbah coming in.
[ct=6656.209] But the Jets able to keep it.
[ct=6660.208] Well, we saw Phillips go down.
[ct=6662.821] You talked about Ogbah.
[ct=6664.181] These are going to be the guys who
[ct=6665.512] are going to have to emerge at those outside linebacker
[ct=6668.186] spots, which in Vic Fangio's system, that's
[ct=6672.134] paramount to have these kind of players.
[ct=6674.799] And 91 there steps up, plays nicely.
[ct=6678.772] Second and 19.
[ct=6681.645] It's caught.
[ct=6682.793] A flat here.
[ct=6684.094] To the 25-yard line goes Ruckert, tight end,
[ct=6688.292] coming to the line in a hurry for what it's worth.
[ct=6690.754] Third down, third and 10.
[ct=6692.094] So Al, 712 games, right off the top of your head, which one
[ct=6696.197] stands out?
[ct=6697.363] Is there one that stands out?
[ct=6698.673] One?
[ct=6700.254] Which Super Bowl?
[ct=6701.416] Well, two Super Bowls, Arizona-Pittsburgh
[ct=6704.018] and Seattle-New England.
[ct=6708.006] Oh yeah, I'll say.
[ct=6709.413] Catch made here.
[ct=6710.669] And that's going to be enough for a first down.
[ct=6712.068] And the Cincinnati Rams game that you had,
[ct=6716.011] Absolutely, that was great.
[ct=6718.615] Yeah, it's funny.
[ct=6719.981] There's so many Super Bowls, which in the early years
[ct=6722.805] were routes and one-sided games.
[ct=6725.273] And all of a sudden, after about Super Bowl 25
[ct=6728.116] or so, most of them have become nail biters.
[ct=6737.517] That pass is incomplete.
[ct=6744.061] I had the Giants-Buffalo game back in the Super Bowl in 1990.
[ct=6749.559] Came down to that last field goal.
[ct=6751.810] No good wide right.
[ct=6753.174] Scott--
[ct=6754.490] That's my fault. Everything's my fault. Of course,
[ct=6757.147] it's my fault.
[ct=6761.127] Why would you even ask?
[ct=6766.445] They call me Mr. Kibosh.
[ct=6777.096] backhanded catch made up at the 39-yard line
[ct=6779.704] but Garrett Wilson.
[ct=6781.020] Nik Needham in on that tackle.
[ct=6785.025] And rolling down to the two-minute warning.
[ct=6793.013] Tua was 21 of 30 for 243.
[ct=6799.606] And on third and 6, the final play
[ct=6800.995] before the two-minute warning is a catch, a broken tackle,
[ct=6806.302] To move the sticks is Dalvin Cook, makes the grab.
[ct=6811.582] --flying tonight.
[ct=6811.651] You're flying back home.
[ct=6812.919] I got to go to Ann Arbor for Ohio State-Michigan.
[ct=6815.572] Your typical weekend, right?
[ct=6816.918] Well, yeah, you're going there for the game day.
[ct=6819.597] And then you're calling the game Saturday night in Florida?
[ct=6821.636] Yeah, down to Gainesville tomorrow night.
[ct=6825.036] And the Dolphins will head back to Florida
[ct=6830.176] after tonight's game.
[ct=6830.364] And they'll be taking with them a record of 8 and 3.
[ct=6842.133] 7-yard pick up here for Xavier Gibson.
[ct=6843.575] I was surprised when we looked back last time the Dolphins
[ct=6847.450] went to the Super Bowl 1984, Dan Marino
[ct=6851.451] second year, 38 seasons ago, last playoff
[ct=6855.401] win from Miami 2000.
[ct=6858.088] Yeah, '84 was Marino's only Super Bowl.
[ct=6860.746] Second year in the league, Joe Montana won the game.
[ct=6866.051] Going deep into double coverage.
[ct=6867.426] And that's incomplete.
[ct=6868.732] By the way, you should know I did the pre-game, halftime,
[ct=6871.415] and postgame of that Super Bowl at Stanford Stadium.
[ct=6875.349] Covered it all.
[ct=6876.805] And my analysts were Tom Landry and OJ Simpson.
[ct=6882.068] Yes, sir.
[ct=6883.328] There you have it.
[ct=6884.643] We're just throwing out everything tonight.
[ct=6887.300] Wait a second, Tom Landry did TV?
[ct=6889.940] Yeah, so they hired him to do the--
[ct=6892.569] Tom?
[ct=6892.952] Well, he was a good partner.
[ct=6893.907] I had to teach him a little bit about television.
[ct=6896.607] But yeah, we were there at Stanford Stadium that day.
[ct=6900.256] That's when Roone Arledge would hire just whoever
[ct=6903.248] the flavor of the moment was.
[ct=6912.222] And a sack again here.
[ct=6913.878] This time he got Da'Shawn Hand.
[ct=6917.861] Boy, they are just teeing off at this point.
[ct=6920.473] This is another Alabama defensive lineman.
[ct=6926.029] You get into obvious passing situations.
[ct=6927.384] And they do a really good job at that simulated pressure, where
[ct=6932.850] they show one look, and go to another,
[ct=6935.350] and make you react to it, and confuse the offensive linemen,
[ct=6938.117] create some one on one matchups.
[ct=6940.699] And Hand has power.
[ct=6941.975] That time he shows quickness.
[ct=6944.644] So fourth down and 14.
[ct=6947.386] He's been sacked six times, not a seventh fortunately.
[ct=6951.298] And that'll turn the ball over and take us to the finish line
[ct=6955.288] after a snap or two.
[ct=6956.565] Nick Bawden is right there.
[ct=6957.917] So the Jets will limp out of here, four-game losing streak,
[ct=6965.901] 4 and 7.
[ct=6967.219] The Jets meanwhile on the right hand side there.
[ct=6968.832] Atlanta and Houston come here.
[ct=6969.897] This is the first of three straight home games.
[ct=6972.139] Then they got to go back to Miami.
[ct=6975.194] And on the left side is Miami.
[ct=6976.489] We've been talking about that schedule at Washington.
[ct=6978.072] But then Tennessee, the Jets, and Dallas,
[ct=6980.713] they have three straight home games leading
[ct=6984.388] into the game at Baltimore.
[ct=6985.799] Yeah, that Baltimore game in Baltimore
[ct=6987.348] we're all going to be anxious to see
[ct=6989.894] the result of that match-up.
[ct=6991.131] But Miami, with everything's going on around them
[ct=6992.888] in the AFC, not just trying to get to the postseason.
[ct=6996.370] But that home field advantage would
[ct=6999.112] be huge for Mike McDaniel and the Dolphins.
[ct=7000.836] That was Mike White, meanwhile, who came in as a Dolphin
[ct=7004.398] now last year with the Jets, who took that snap
[ct=7008.254] and the kneel down.
[ct=7009.709] So he does get into the game.
[ct=7011.085] To wrap it up, Tyreek Hill tonight
[ct=7013.994] had a total of nine grabs for 102 yards.
[ct=7018.973] Waddle had 114.
[ct=7024.316] Tua getting congratulated by one Tim Boyle.
[ct=7032.281] 10 offensive TDs this season, the fewest through this period
[ct=7036.617] of time going back to '09.
[ct=7039.062] And the Dolphins on the other side
[ct=7040.706] of that coin with 40 plus touchdowns.
[ct=7045.613] And again, that Dolphin offense tonight racking up
[ct=7052.367] a total of 396 yards.
[ct=7056.206] Richard Sherman and the gang.
