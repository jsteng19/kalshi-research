[ct=5.774] THE FIELD IS WILLIAMS.
[ct=11.237] >> YOU FACE THE VIKINGS WITH THE
[ct=15.175] SECOND RANKED RUN DEFENSE, WHAT
[ct=16.414] WILL IT TAKE TO HAVE SUCCESS?
[ct=23.092] >> CONFIDENCE, BELIEF, IT IS NOT
[ct=25.684] ROCKET SCIENCE, NOTHING WE DON'T
[ct=27.094] ALREADY KNOW.
[ct=30.889] >> YOU WILL GET SOME HELP WITH
[ct=32.806] THE RETURN OF COOPER CUP.
[ct=35.442] HOW CAN THEIR PRESENCE CHANGE
[ct=36.753] YOUR ATTACK?
[ct=40.061] >> THEY GET OPEN AND MAKE STUFF
[ct=43.789] HAPPEN, SO THEY BRING A LOT OF
[ct=47.576] THREATS TO THE DEFENSE AND I AM
[ct=50.417] EXCITED, EXCITED.
[ct=55.387] AL: RAMS FANS ARE EXCITED, THERE
[ct=62.288] IS COOPER KUPP, BUT NOT
[ct=66.286] NECESSARILY READY.
[ct=67.855] THE TWO GUYS WHO WERE TOGETHER
[ct=71.606] FOR 24 SNAPS ARE BOTH IN ACTION.
[ct=76.897] RAMS WINNING THE TOSS, ETHAN
[ct=82.265] EVANS HAS HAD 29 KICKOFFS AND 28
[ct=83.554] TOUCHBACKS AND ONE.
[ct=88.833] SO MUCH FOR THE DYNAMIC KICKOFF
[ct=90.172] WITH THIS GUY.
[ct=93.369] VIKINGS WILL START.
[ct=98.538] SAM DARNOLD WENT TO USC, NUMBER
[ct=101.208] THREE PICK OVERALL, BAKER
[ct=104.439] MAYFIELD WENT FIRST WITH THE
[ct=104.651] JETS.
[ct=111.891] THEY SENT HIM TO CAROLINA.
[ct=116.326] MCCARTHY IS GONE FOR THE SEASON.
[ct=126.562] AARON JONES, FORMER PACKER CJ
[ct=131.129] AND THEY START WITH JONES TO THE
[ct=132.129] 35 YARD LINE.
[ct=139.605] KEVIN O'CONNELL IS HERE AND WAS
[ct=141.617] OFFENSE OF COORDINATOR AGAINST
[ct=142.316] CINCINNATI.
[ct=148.227] SEAN IS IN HIS EIGHTH SEASON AS
[ct=148.227] THE HEAD COACH OF THE RAM.
[ct=153.534] WHAT A COACHING TREE HE HAS
[ct=153.534] DEVELOPED.
[ct=157.747] ON SECOND DOWN AND FIVE, THE
[ct=163.783] PASS IS CAUGHT, JEFFERSON IS
[ct=165.577] TACKLED BY WILLIAMS AND IT IS
[ct=166.057] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=173.533] KIRK: JEFFERSON AND SAM DARNOLD
[ct=175.658] OFF TO A SLOW START, THREE
[ct=176.883] RECEPTIONS GOING BACK TO JOE
[ct=180.647] BURROW AT LSU, JEFFERSON LIKE A
[ct=182.367] LOT OF THE GREAT ONES LIKES TO
[ct=185.995] GET HIS HANDS ON THE BALL, GOOD
[ct=187.774] JOB BY SAM DARNOLD MAKING THE
[ct=188.023] THROW.
[ct=194.590] HOW: TWO TIGHT ENDS IN THIS,
[ct=195.309] NICE MOVE BY JONES.
[ct=200.365] GETS TO THE OUTSIDE AND THEN HE
[ct=203.840] BREAKS AWAY FROM THE RAMS NUMBER
[ct=206.782] ONE AND IT IS SECOND DOWN AND
[ct=207.032] SHORT.
[ct=214.886] KIRK: HECK OF A BLOCK BY JORDAN,
[ct=216.248] SPRINTS TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=222.591] AL: JONES WILL TAKE THE BALL
[ct=225.560] INTO THE RAMS TERRITORY.
[ct=231.049] KIRK: HE DOES A GOOD JOB OF
[ct=233.713] MANAGING, IT HAS BEEN A BIG
[ct=240.456] STORY THIS YEAR, THE JOB NOT
[ct=244.131] JUST SAM IS DOING, BUT THE
[ct=248.914] POSITION KEVIN O'CONNELL PUT HIM
[ct=251.278] IN ALLOWS HIM TO GIVE HIM
[ct=253.452] LAST-MINUTE ADJUSTMENTS.
[ct=259.270] AL: SAM DARNOLD LOOKING DOWN THE
[ct=264.056] FIELD, COMPLETION, JEFFERSON TO
[ct=266.764] THE 25 YARD LINE, VIKINGS ARE
[ct=272.022] VERY STRONG AND THE RAMS SAFETY
[ct=272.022] IS DOWN.
[ct=277.087] INJURY TIMEOUT, ANOTHER
[ct=277.595] SPECTACULAR SEASON.
[ct=283.878] KIRK: THIS IS AN AREA WHERE HE
[ct=286.197] HAS WORKED TO BECOME NEXT LEVEL.
[ct=291.414] WES PHILLIPS SAID WITH THE
[ct=291.930] ABILITY TO PUSH THE BALL DOWN
[ct=302.059] THE FIELD BEING MORE CLEAN WAS A
[ct=313.441] IT IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY, KIM
[ct=317.992] RETURN FOR A TOUCHDOWN, A ROOKIE
[ct=320.641] OUT OF MIAMI WILL TAKE HIS SPOT,
[ct=323.296] THE SAFETY SPOT IN THE DRIVE
[ct=325.521] RESUMES FOR MINNESOTA.
[ct=337.132] PICKS UP ABOUT FOUR, SECOND DOWN
[ct=338.185] AND SIX.
[ct=344.663] KIRK: CHRIS SHULA IS TRYING TO
[ct=344.857] FIGURE OUT LIFE WITHOUT AARON
[ct=348.651] DONALD, AS A FIRST-TIME
[ct=349.157] DEFENSIVE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR
[ct=354.295] THAT USE TO PLAY SHELL DEFENSE,
[ct=356.586] YOU'VE GOT KOBIE TURNER AND SOME
[ct=360.570] OTHERS TRYING TO BE MORE
[ct=364.557] CREATIVE WITH STUNTS AND
[ct=364.801] BLITZING, TRYING TO FIND THAT
[ct=365.038] IDENTITY.
[ct=372.984] AL: SAM DARNOLD SECOND AND
[ct=373.790] SEVENTH, SHOULDER SHAKE, FIRES
[ct=374.625] IT UP THE MIDDLE, CAUGHT.
[ct=379.182] WILLIAMS MAKES THE TACKLE AND IT
[ct=379.869] IS FIRST AND GOAL FOR THE
[ct=380.080] VIKINGS.
[ct=384.883] KIRK: NOW YOU'VE GOT POINT
[ct=390.945] PLAYING, HE IS AN EDGE GUY BUT
[ct=391.713] THESE MIDDLE LINEBACKERS WITH
[ct=393.704] THEIR EYES IN THE BACKFIELD ARE
[ct=396.617] GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THE VIKINGS
[ct=399.858] DID A GREAT JOB OF ATTACKING THE
[ct=402.516] INTERIOR BEHIND THE LINEBACKERS
[ct=406.540] AND FINDING JEFFERSON AND SAM
[ct=407.017] DARNOLD ABLE TO MAKE THAT THROW.
[ct=409.879] ALL DRIVE BY THE VIKINGS.
[ct=417.168] AL: THEY HAVE OUTSCORED 58-3
[ct=418.459] OVER SIX GAMES.
[ct=421.229] WIDE OPEN, TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=428.324] JOSH OLIVER, SO SAM DARNOLD
[ct=436.025] COMES BACK TO LOS ANGELES, 4-4
[ct=438.662] ON THAT DRIVE AND SIX-NOTHING,
[ct=439.619] GOING ON SEVEN.
[ct=444.353] KIRK: WATCH THE SAFETY TRYING TO
[ct=446.127] COMMUNICATE AND NOW WATCH THE
[ct=450.978] SAFETY TRY TO LOCATE, I'VE GOT
[ct=450.978] TO GET OVER THERE.
[ct=456.591] JUST A LITTLE THING, WHAT THEY
[ct=458.098] DO BEFORE THE SNAP REALLY CAN
[ct=460.957] IMPACT THE PLAY CALL TO PRODUCE
[ct=461.238] TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=464.948] AL: THE ROOKIE HAS HAD A PERFECT
[ct=467.356] SEASON, THAT CONTINUES.
[ct=480.648] KAYLEE: -- AL: THEY'VE ONLY
[ct=483.532] ALLOWED THREE, THIS IS LIKE
[ct=487.269] HORSE RACING AND IN THEIR FIRST
[ct=489.979] FIVE GAMES THEY ARE THE HORSE,
[ct=489.979] WIRE TO WIRE.
[ct=495.241] OVERTAKEN DOWN THE BACKSTRETCH
[ct=498.457] AND THEN THE, THEY GOT BEATEN AT
[ct=499.142] THE WIDER.
[ct=504.964] KIRK: I LIKE THOSE ANALOGIES, I
[ct=505.538] LIKE THOSE COMPARISON.
[ct=513.261] AL: RAMS WITH STAFFORD WILL TAKE
[ct=514.536] OVER.
[ct=519.065] FOR MATTHEWS IT HAS BEEN A ROUGH
[ct=519.305] YEAR.
[ct=524.125] RECEIVERS ARE BACK TONIGHT AND
[ct=527.635] THE OFFENSIVE LINE, THREE OF
[ct=531.589] THEIR STARTERS ARE ON INJURED
[ct=531.589] RESERVE.
[ct=536.622] KIRK: A ROOKIE OUT OF ARKANSAS,
[ct=536.843] LEFT GUARD.
[ct=541.031] ANOTHER ROOKIE, A FREE AGENT.
[ct=545.123] GOING UP AGAINST BRIAN FLOREZ IN
[ct=545.580] A COMPLEX DEFENSE.
[ct=552.179] AL: THEY DID NOT WASTE ANY TIME
[ct=552.740] AND IT IS DROPPED THERE.
[ct=557.530] SO THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH WILL
[ct=558.615] THEY PLAY TONIGHT, IS HE GOING
[ct=558.867] TO PLAY?
[ct=562.590] HE IS ACTIVE, HE IS RIGHT THERE,
[ct=563.940] THE PASS IS THERE, HE COULD NOT
[ct=564.167] HOLD ON.
[ct=570.588] KIRK: AS GOOD AS HE IS, LOOK AT
[ct=573.255] HIS EYES, HE'S STARTING TO LOOK
[ct=574.881] UP AND HE DID NOT HAVE THE BALL
[ct=575.379] SECURED, HE LOSES IT.
[ct=585.197] THERE THEY GO, WALKING GUYS, --
[ct=590.677] AL: HE MAKES THIS CATCH,
[ct=594.866] BREAKING TACKLE AT THE 44 YARD
[ct=597.979] LINE, JACKSON, LEFT TACKLE,
[ct=600.140] SPRINGING INTO A NICE
[ct=605.478] DOWN.
[ct=608.478] KIRK: THAT FREED HIM UP TO HAVE
[ct=608.695] SOME SPACE.
[ct=615.116] THEY WALKED SIX UP HERE AND YOU
[ct=615.310] MOVE COOPER KUPP, WATCH THE
[ct=617.721] LINEBACKERS, THEN THROW BACK THE
[ct=618.244] OTHER WAY.
[ct=620.392] WELL-DESIGNED BY SEAN MCVAY.
[ct=625.581] AL: THE MAN IN MOTION, THERE IS
[ct=627.409] WILLIAMS WITH A BIG HOLE.
[ct=631.975] UP 13 AND
[ct=638.086] KIRK: KYREN WILLIAMS, A LOT OF
[ct=639.365] ATTENTION HAS BEEN ON STAFFORD.
[ct=642.076] WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE OFFENSE?
[ct=643.346] INJURIES.
[ct=647.331] BUT WHEN YOU GET THESE TWO
[ct=648.901] RECEIVERS BACK, THESE ARE BIG
[ct=649.201] GUYS.
[ct=651.879] 6'2", 210.
[ct=654.049] THEY BLOCK WELL.
[ct=656.046] THE BENEFICIARY IS NOT JUST
[ct=659.476] STAFFORD, IT IS THE RUN GAME, AS
[ct=659.765] WELL.
[ct=663.773] AL: WILLIAMS WITH A TOUCHDOWN IN
[ct=664.225] NINE CONSECUTIVE GAMES.
[ct=669.067] STAFFORD THROWS IT TO THE LEFT,
[ct=670.420] HITS TYLER JOHNSON.
[ct=675.737] THAT WILL SET UP A SECOND DOWN
[ct=675.972] AND 4.
[ct=681.024] YOU LOOK AT BRIAN FLORES, THE
[ct=681.500] VIKINGS DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR.
[ct=683.925] KIRK: YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE ABOUT
[ct=684.152] YOUR DEFENSE?
[ct=688.739] YOU LOOK AT ALL THE GUYS ON THE
[ct=691.088] DEFENSE, THEY BROUGHT IN FOUR OR
[ct=691.833] FIVE NEW FACES.
[ct=695.006] THEY ALL HAVE CHIPS ON THEIR
[ct=695.255] SHOULDER.
[ct=700.259] BRIAN FLORES HAS A BIT OF A CHIP
[ct=700.768] ON HIS SHOULDER AS A DEFENSIVE
[ct=700.988] COORDINATOR.
[ct=705.191] A PERFECT MARRIAGE OF INTENSITY
[ct=705.640] AND HOW THEY PLAY WITH OTHER
[ct=713.174] AL: TIMEOUT TAKEN HERE BY THE
[ct=716.039] RAMS WITH 8:30 TO GO IN THE
[ct=716.327] QUARTER.
[ct=720.268] THE VIKINGS FELT GOOD ENOUGH
[ct=723.945] ABOUT THE GUYS THEY BROUGHT IN
[ct=726.580] TO LET THE DEAL HUNTER OUT THE
[ct=730.542] DOOR.
[ct=733.235] KIRK: HOW ABOUT ANDREW VAN
[ct=734.625] GINKEL COMING OVER FROM MIAMI?
[ct=738.849] HE HAS BEEN ASKED TO DO A LOT OF
[ct=738.849] THINGS ON DEFENSE.
[ct=741.764] BLAKE CASHMAN CAME OVER FROM
[ct=742.053] HOUSTON.
[ct=745.690] HE IS THE COMMUNICATOR, THE
[ct=746.263] MIDDLE LINEBACKER.
[ct=749.702] HE IS NOT DRESSED SO THEY ARE
[ct=751.032] HAPPY TO COME UP WITH ANSWERS
[ct=751.272] WITHOUT HIM.
[ct=754.799] YOU SEE VAN GINKGO MOVING AROUND
[ct=755.041] EVEN MORE.
[ct=764.235] -- YOU CAN SEE VAN GINKGO MOVING
[ct=764.507] AROUND.
[ct=768.087] IT HAS BEEN A GREAT START TO THE
[ct=772.298] AL: MOTION BY NACUA.
[ct=773.909] PLAY FAKE.
[ct=776.187] NACUA TAKES THE PASS AND NACUA
[ct=782.576] IS INSIDE THE 30, INSIDE THE 20
[ct=783.332] TO THE 16 YARD LINE.
[ct=788.918] THE GUARDS GOT OUT TO PROVIDE
[ct=789.178] THE CONVOY.
[ct=793.154] KIRK: YOU HAVE THE BACK BACK
[ct=795.814] HERE AND A TIGHT END, YOU HAVE
[ct=798.427] SEVEN TO PROTECT AGAINST THAT
[ct=798.958] AGGRESSIVE DOWNHILL DEFENSE.
[ct=801.394] GOOD JOB PICKING UP IVAN PACE.
[ct=804.787] YOU HAVE BLOCKERS DOWNFIELD AND
[ct=805.019] A CONVOY.
[ct=807.398] GOOD JOB PICKING UP POSITIVE
[ct=807.665] YARDS.
[ct=811.155] I LOVE HOW QUICK THE BALL IS
[ct=811.688] GETTING OUT OF THE HANDS OF
[ct=811.888] MATTHEW STAFFORD.
[ct=814.815] AL: WILLIAMS.
[ct=816.798] TRYING TO FIND A SPOT.
[ct=821.206] A FLAG THROWN, OUR FIRST OF THE
[ct=821.467] GAME.
[ct=824.135] PRETTY OBVIOUS WHAT WENT ON.
[ct=828.726] KIRK: YOU GOT THE FACEMASK,
[ct=828.726] BEFORE HE EVEN WENT DOWN.
[ct=833.162] AL: TWO OFFICIALS SAY, "WE GOT
[ct=834.447] IT."
[ct=839.182] REFEREE: PERSONAL FOUL, DEFENSE,
[ct=839.794] NUMBER 0.
[ct=842.994] HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL,
[ct=845.072] AL: IVAN PACE.
[ct=850.689] HE HAD A FUMBLE RETURN FOR A
[ct=851.189] TOUCHDOWN SUNDAY AGAINST
[ct=851.427] DETROIT.
[ct=854.602] THAT MAKES IT A FIRST DOWN AND
[ct=854.887] GOAL.
[ct=861.022] SO FAR, TWO RUNS AND FOUR
[ct=861.022] PASSES.
[ct=863.912] THE RAMS TRYING TO ANSWER
[ct=866.103] MINNESOTA'S OPENING SALVO.
[ct=870.494] WILLIAMS.
[ct=873.166] TWO THE 5.
[ct=876.439] PACE MAKING THE TACKLE.
[ct=878.350] SECOND DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=881.445] KIRK: THIS OPENING DRIVE BY THE
[ct=883.912] RAMS, DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB.
[ct=885.965] THE BALL IS GETTING OUT OF HIS
[ct=886.227] HANDS.
[ct=889.394] DIFFERENT LOOKS, FORMATIONS AND
[ct=889.604] MOTIONS.
[ct=893.462] THEY ARE GETTING OFFENSIVE
[ct=896.004] LINEMEN IN SPACE AGAINST SMALL
[ct=896.750] THEIR DEFENSIVE BACKS.
[ct=899.395] THAT IS A GOOD THING WHEN YOU
[ct=899.948] COULD GET THE BALL OUT.
[ct=902.397] SECOND AND THIRD LEVEL, LINEMEN
[ct=905.565] ARE RUNNING DOWNHILL.
[ct=913.452] AL: KUPP IN MOTION.
[ct=917.464] STAFFORD FIRES AND THAT IS
[ct=917.700] INCOMPLETE.
[ct=921.293] KUPP IS LOOKING FOR A FLAG, WILL
[ct=921.503] NOT GET ONE.
[ct=924.379] STEPHAN GILMORE.
[ct=927.043] NOW A VIKING.
[ct=930.555] KIRK: KUPP WILL GO IN MOTION
[ct=931.298] FROM THE RIGHT TO THE LEFT.
[ct=933.963] STAFFORD WORKS TO THE RIGHT,
[ct=936.570] LOOK AT HIS HEAD, AND THEN COMES
[ct=936.799] BACK.
[ct=940.565] GREAT JOB OF PROTECTING BY THE
[ct=940.565] OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=944.546] IT LOOKED LIKE HE MIGHT HAVE
[ct=947.172] GRABBED HOLD OF THE HIP.
[ct=949.982] THAT IS WHAT THE CROWD IS
[ct=950.191] REACTING TO.
[ct=951.719] AL: ABSOLUTELY.
[ct=953.323] SAW THE REPLAY.
[ct=955.433] THIRD DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=963.408] IN THE POCKET, TOUCHDOWN, KYREN
[ct=963.673] WILLIAMS!
[ct=971.410] HIS SECOND RECEIVING TOUCHDOWN
[ct=971.665] OF THE SEASON.
[ct=976.007] KIRK: WHAT A CALL HERE.
[ct=979.296] I HAPPEN TO BE WATCHING KYREN
[ct=979.985] WILLIAMS LIVE.
[ct=983.737] WATCH IVAN PACE THINK THE ROUTE
[ct=984.203] IS COMING OUT HERE.
[ct=986.537] WATCH HOW HE GETS HIMSELF OUT OF
[ct=986.827] POSITION.
[ct=989.724] RUNS OUT, PUTS HIS FOOT IN THE
[ct=993.360] GROUND, EASY ONE-ON-ONE MATCHUP
[ct=995.166] AND A GREAT WAY TO ATTACK THE
[ct=996.541] INTERIOR OF THE VIKINGS DEFENSE
[ct=1000.003] WITH A BACK AGAINST A LINEBACKER
[ct=1000.489] TO POTENTIALLY TIE THIS ONE UP.
[ct=1003.904] AL: KARTY, A ROOKIE FROM
[ct=1004.396] STANFORD.
[ct=1006.806] THIS ONE IS GOOD.
[ct=1011.018] EACH TEAM WITH A STELLAR OPENING
[ct=1013.450] DRIVE ON THIS THURSDAY NIGHT IN
[ct=1013.450] SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
[ct=1014.798] 7-7.
[ct=1018.758] DO NOT SEE VERY MANY.
[ct=1022.743] GOT THE WHOLE THING GOING ON.
[ct=1028.171] T-MAN, OUR PRODUCER.
[ct=1030.846] MEANWHILE, ANOTHER TOUCHBACK.
[ct=1034.322] HE HAS ONLY ALLOWED ONE RUN BACK
[ct=1034.904] THIS YEAR, THE RAMS KICKER.
[ct=1037.745] KIRK: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR
[ct=1037.996] NEXGEN STATS.
[ct=1040.227] JUSTIN JEFFERSON.
[ct=1043.125] VERY INVOLVED IN THE OPENING
[ct=1043.125] DRIVE.
[ct=1048.469] 263 RECEIVING YARDS AND FOUR
[ct=1049.736] TOUCHDOWNS AGAINST MAN COVERAGE.
[ct=1053.723] THE OPENING DRIVE, RAMS TRYING
[ct=1054.212] TO KEEP HIM IN FRONT OF THEM AND
[ct=1057.204] THE VIKINGS DID A GOOD JOB OF
[ct=1058.211] HITTING THE INTERIOR ROUTES TO
[ct=1058.439] JEFFERSON.
[ct=1062.641] THEY WENT EIGHT PLAYS, 70 YARDS
[ct=1064.183] ON THE TOUCHDOWN DRIVE AND DID
[ct=1064.742] NOT HAVE ONE THIRD DOWN.
[ct=1067.872] AL: DARNOLD STARTS 4-4.
[ct=1070.944] THEY WRAP UP JONES AT THE LINE
[ct=1071.503] OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=1073.951] KAYLEE: AS SOON AS KEVIN
[ct=1077.184] O'CONNELL WALKED INTO THE
[ct=1078.375] VIKINGS FACILITY DAYS REMOVED
[ct=1079.139] FROM WINNING THE SUPER BOWL WITH
[ct=1081.539] THE RAMS, JUSTIN JEFFERSON TELLS
[ct=1084.483] ME HE ASKED HIM HOW DID COOPER
[ct=1084.729] KUPP GET SO OPEN?
[ct=1088.676] JEFFERSON BELIEVED HIS NEW HEAD
[ct=1089.241] COACH COULD GET HIM TO THAT
[ct=1089.493] LEVEL.
[ct=1092.465] THE MAIN THING OÂ™CONNELL TOLD
[ct=1093.721] HIM WAS TO LEARN EVERY RECEIVER
[ct=1099.287] AL: HE MAKES AS MANY SPECTACULAR
[ct=1099.834] CATCHES AS ANYBODY.
[ct=1105.680] AL: LOOKING THAT WAY.
[ct=1107.766] THE PASS IS THROWN TO THE
[ct=1109.658] OUTSIDE AND THAT TIME IT IS
[ct=1112.034] ADDISON MAKING THE GRAB APPEARED
[ct=1114.554] ADDISON PLAYED HIS COLLEGE BALL
[ct=1116.508] AT USC.
[ct=1121.771] KIRK: YOU MOVE HIM BACK HERE, HE
[ct=1124.157] ALMOST USE HIM AS A DECOY TO GET
[ct=1125.324] CARNELL LAKE IN THE FLAT.
[ct=1130.167] TWO DEFENDERS AND YOU GO OVER
[ct=1132.573] THE TOP TO ANOTHER GIFTED
[ct=1132.796] RECEIVER, JORDAN ADDISON.
[ct=1135.803] THAT IS AN AREA THAT THE
[ct=1137.861] UNSELFISH SIDE OF JEFFERSON.
[ct=1141.579] HE WILL GET BRACKETED OR
[ct=1142.085] DOUBLE-TEAMED AND THAT WILL OPEN
[ct=1144.093] UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE OTHER
[ct=1148.485] AL: JONES.
[ct=1153.540] IT IS NEVER BAD TO HAVE A NUMBER
[ct=1156.670] 2 RECEIVER, YOU HAVE AN ALPHA
[ct=1157.603] AND A BETA.
[ct=1162.542] IF THE BETA IS GOOD, THAT TAKES
[ct=1163.071] PRESSURE OFF THE ALPHA.
[ct=1166.529] KIRK: JORDAN ADDISON HAS TO
[ct=1167.041] LEARN OTHER POSITIONS.
[ct=1169.240] JALEN NAILOR HAS TO LEARN THAT.
[ct=1171.650] WHEN T.J. HOCKENSON COMES BACK.
[ct=1173.437] EVEN AARON JONES.
[ct=1176.599] WE TALKED ABOUT HIM COMING OVER
[ct=1176.872] FROM GREEN BAY.
[ct=1180.365] WEAPONS ON THIS VIKINGS OFFENSE
[ct=1183.234] AND A VETERAN OFFENSIVE LINE IN
[ct=1185.154] FOUR OF THE FIVE SPOTS.
[ct=1188.052] AL: HOCKENSON MIGHT BE READY TO
[ct=1188.619] COME BACK IN THE NEXT GAME.
[ct=1192.242] DARNOLD FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE TO
[ct=1192.535] THE 41.
[ct=1195.952] JEFFERSON HAVING A GREAT FIRST
[ct=1199.294] FOUR GRABS FOR HIM ALREADY.
[ct=1202.270] DARNOLD IS PERFECT, 5-5.
[ct=1206.386] KIRK: OMAR SPEIGHTS JUST LOST IN
[ct=1208.865] COVERAGE, IN FOR TROY REEDER.
[ct=1210.470] LOOK AT THAT.
[ct=1213.146] UNTIL THEY CORRECT THIS AND
[ct=1218.341] START TO SYNC A BIT OR CHANGE
[ct=1219.891] THE COVERAGE, JUST KEEP THROWING
[ct=1223.419] IT TO 18 OVER THE MIDDLE BECAUSE
[ct=1224.164] THE LINEBACKERS ARE NOT GETTING
[ct=1225.255] DEPTH.
[ct=1229.045] A GOOD JOB BY SAM DARNOLD
[ct=1229.596] THROWING IN RHYTHM.
[ct=1235.940] AL: DARNOLD BUYS TIME, ROLLS,
[ct=1237.495] WILL RUN IT AND SLIDES TO A STOP
[ct=1239.121] INSIDE THE 25-YARD LINE.
[ct=1245.266] WITH 3:48 AND TICKING DOWN UNTIL
[ct=1246.787] THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER,
[ct=1247.285] THE VIKINGS ARE ON THE MOVE
[ct=1247.571] AGAIN.
[ct=1252.019] KIRK: NEW YORK JETS FANS HAVE TO
[ct=1253.566] BE WATCHING SAM DARNOLD -- IF I
[ct=1255.213] NEED ANOTHER THING TO DRIVE ME
[ct=1257.352] CRAZY, I HAVE TO WATCH SAM
[ct=1257.575] DARNOLD IN PURPLE?
[ct=1262.123] CAROLINA FANS, WHAT IN THE HECK
[ct=1263.162] IS GOING ON WITH SAM DARNOLD?
[ct=1266.132] IT IS KEVIN O'CONNELL AND WES
[ct=1267.804] PHILLIPS HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB
[ct=1268.312] WORKING WITH HIM.
[ct=1272.514] AL: LOOK AT JONES BANGING HIS
[ct=1273.272] WAY TO THE 22-YARD LINE.
[ct=1276.486] IT IS INTERESTING WITH AARON
[ct=1279.648] JONES, AND HIS EIGHTH YEAR IN
[ct=1280.746] THE LEAGUE -- THEY WILL GO FAST
[ct=1284.679] HE HAS DONE SO MUCH DAMAGE TO
[ct=1284.891] THE VIKINGS OVER THE YEARS AS A
[ct=1287.834] PACKER, NOW HE IS ON THE OTHER
[ct=1288.086] SIDE.
[ct=1292.552] THIRD AND 1, DARNOLD TAKES IT
[ct=1292.552] HIMSELF.
[ct=1296.730] THE RAMS CITY DID NOT GET IT BUT
[ct=1297.261] THE OFFICIALS WILL MAKE THE
[ct=1297.527] JUDGMENT.
[ct=1299.850] AND THEY SIGNAL A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1303.358] KIRK: IT IS CRAZY TO SEE AARON
[ct=1304.127] JONES AFTER ALL THOSE LAMBEAU
[ct=1307.951] LEAPS NOW WEARING PURPLE
[ct=1307.951] AND GOLD.
[ct=1311.308] YOU TALK ABOUT A DIFFERENCE
[ct=1311.308] MAKER IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=1314.255] YOU GET CAUGHT UP WITH JUSTIN
[ct=1316.847] JEFFERSON AND DOUBLING HIM AND
[ct=1317.385] YOU HAVE JORDAN ADDISON AND
[ct=1317.633] JALEN NAILOR.
[ct=1319.565] EVENTUALLY YOU GET T.J.
[ct=1320.025] HOCKENSON BACK.
[ct=1323.747] NOW INSTEAD OF A PHYSICAL BACK
[ct=1325.375] LIKE LAST YEAR WITH ALEXANDER
[ct=1328.211] MATTISON, NOW YOU HAVE AN
[ct=1328.805] ELECTRIC BACK WITH AARON JONES.
[ct=1331.939] AL: SHORT DROP, PASS TO THE
[ct=1331.939] OUTSIDE.
[ct=1335.921] AGAIN THAT IS JEFFERSON, MAKING
[ct=1336.689] HIS FIFTH CATCH.
[ct=1339.952] COBIE DURANT COVERING ON THE
[ct=1340.139] PLAY.
[ct=1344.252] DARNOLD IS 7-7 AND JEFFERSON HAS
[ct=1346.563] CAUGHT FIVE 468 ALREADY.
[ct=1349.667] KIRK: WHAT I WAS GOING -- AL:
[ct=1354.451] JEFFERSON HAS CAUGHT FIVE FOR 68
[ct=1354.756] ALREADY.
[ct=1357.900] KIRK: HE HAS PLAYERS AROUND HIM
[ct=1359.492] AND COACHES THAT HAVE BUILD HIS
[ct=1359.757] CONFIDENCE UP.
[ct=1362.109] HE WAS THE THIRD PICK OVERALL.
[ct=1365.239] IT WAS A MATTER OF HIM SITTING
[ct=1366.978] IN IN THE RIGHT SYSTEM WITH THE
[ct=1369.161] RIGHT PLAYERS AROUND HIM AND HE
[ct=1369.690] HAS FOUND A HOME WITH MINNESOTA.
[ct=1374.419] AL: SECOND AND 5 OUT OF THE
[ct=1374.653] PISTOL, JONES AGAIN.
[ct=1377.940] NOT TOO MANY GUYS GO FROM GREEN
[ct=1378.213] BAY TO MINNESOTA.
[ct=1381.559] BRETT FAVRE DID IT BUT HE MADE A
[ct=1382.618] STOP IN NEW YORK.
[ct=1384.484] KIRK: THAT IS RIGHT.
[ct=1386.879] AL: CONNECTED.
[ct=1386.879] KIRK: [LAUGHTER]
[ct=1388.455] HOW ABOUT JONES?
[ct=1390.862] ANOTHER GUY WHO COMES OVER.
[ct=1396.173] HE UNDERSTOOD BEFORE HE SIGNED
[ct=1396.173] TO COME OVER TO MINNESOTA,
[ct=1398.868] JEFFERSON AND THESE RECEIVERS
[ct=1399.348] WILL GET A LOT OF ATTENTION.
[ct=1402.254] THAT IS NOT A BAD THING FOR ME
[ct=1402.836] AND THIS RUNNING GAME.
[ct=1406.415] BEFORE THAT PAY ATTENTION TO 18,
[ct=1408.756] THAT WILL OPEN RUNNING LANES FO
[ct=1409.023] ME.
[ct=1412.580] AL: FIRST AND GOAL, BALL SPOT IT
[ct=1412.857] AT THE 10.
[ct=1416.347] DARNOLD, GOOD PROTECTION, THAT
[ct=1418.383] IS CAUGHT BY SHERFIELD.
[ct=1421.081] TRENT SHERFIELD, FOR THE
[ct=1421.390] TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=1425.149] WHAT A START FOR THE VIKINGS.
[ct=1428.836] THEY ARE USED TO THAT, THE WAY
[ct=1430.277] THEY HAVE STARTED ALMOST EVERY
[ct=1430.830] FIRST QUARTER THIS SEASON.
[ct=1433.731] KIRK: IT IS ALMOST LIKE WATCHING
[ct=1434.717] A SEVEN ON SEVEN DRILL WITH THE
[ct=1438.210] WE DID NOT EVEN BRING UP
[ct=1440.635] SHERFIELD, 11, WHO JUST WORKS
[ct=1440.635] ACROSS.
[ct=1445.499] LINEBACKERS, EYES IN THE
[ct=1446.211] BACKFIELD, THEY DO NOT PICK HIM
[ct=1446.769] UP UNTIL LATE.
[ct=1449.252] EASY THROW IN RHYTHM FOR SAM
[ct=1449.497] DARNOLD.
[ct=1451.597] THAT COULD NOT HAVE GONE ANY
[ct=1453.219] BETTER FOR THE VIKINGS.
[ct=1456.848] AL: IS PERFECT SEASON CONTINUES,
[ct=1457.402] HE MAKES THE EXTRA POINT.
[ct=1461.978] FINAL MINUTE, FIRST QUARTER ON
[ct=1461.978] THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL.
[ct=1464.653] WHAT A START.
[ct=1466.170] MINNESOTA 14, L.A. 7.
[ct=1469.958] IT IN HIS FIFTH
[ct=1470.680] YEAR AS HEAD COACH.
[ct=1475.217] ANOTHER GUY ON SEAN MCVAY'S
[ct=1475.442] COACHING TREE.
[ct=1479.574] THE RAMS WENT ALL IN, GOT VON
[ct=1479.763] MILLER, TRADED FOR STAFFORD
[ct=1482.198] IT PAID OFF.
[ct=1483.545] THERE IS THE BANNER.
[ct=1490.440] THE KICK IS TAKEN THREE YARDS
[ct=1495.508] STAFFORD’
[ct=1496.585] STAFFORD'S NAME IS BEING THROWN
[ct=1496.831] OUT IN THE RUMOR MILL.
[ct=1499.419] IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT COOPER
[ct=1502.143] KUPP COULD GET TRADED.
[ct=1504.742] THERE IS A PREMIUM FOR WIDE
[ct=1504.965] RECEIVERS WITH THE TEAMS THAT
[ct=1505.252] NEED THEM.
[ct=1507.957] THE RAMS WOULD NEED SOMETHING
[ct=1508.204] REALLY GOOD.
[ct=1511.701] TONIGHT'S GAME WILL BE A BIG
[ct=1512.200] FACTOR WITH WHAT HAPPENS.
[ct=1516.803] KIRK: IF THEY ARE ABLE TO WIN
[ct=1517.540] THIS FOOTBALL GAME, WHY WOULD
[ct=1518.571] YOU WANT TO MAKE A MOVE, SITTING
[ct=1520.214] AT 3-4?
[ct=1522.806] JUST LIKE LAST YEAR, WHEN THEY
[ct=1525.288] WON SEVEN OF THEIR LAST EIGHT.
[ct=1528.909] AL: IF THEY WIN TONIGHT, THEY
[ct=1531.004] WOULD BE 3-4 AND GOING TO
[ct=1532.117] SEATTLE.
[ct=1537.447] NACUA, AS OF MONDAY, PEOPLE SAID
[ct=1537.968] HE WOULD NOT PLAY.
[ct=1541.140] ALL OF THE SUDDEN, NOT ONLY IS
[ct=1543.069] HE PLAYING, HE HAS BEEN TARGETED
[ct=1546.819] FOUR TIMES, THREE CATCHES, 50
[ct=1550.593] KIRK: THEY ARE ATTACKING THE
[ct=1551.316] INTERIOR OF THE SECOND LEVEL.
[ct=1554.239] THE LINEBACKER IS UPTIGHT, SIX
[ct=1556.894] GUYS COMING ON PRESSURE, THE
[ct=1559.266] BALL IS GETTING OUT OF HIS HAND
[ct=1560.628] ON THE LINE IS DOING A GREAT JOB
[ct=1563.384] SO FAR HELPING OUT MATTHEW
[ct=1563.888] STAFFORD AGAINST THE PASS RUSH.
[ct=1565.524] AL: PROTECTED WELL.
[ct=1568.514] REACHING BACK AND INCOMPLETE.
[ct=1572.940] COOPER KUPP TRIED TO REACH BACK
[ct=1572.940] FOR IT.
[ct=1575.775] PASS ERRANT.
[ct=1578.446] 10 SECONDS LEFT IN THE QUARTER.
[ct=1579.667] SECOND DOWN.
[ct=1581.410] KIRK: NEVER SECURED IT.
[ct=1584.059] AGAIN, ANOTHER QUICK BALL.
[ct=1586.278] THAT ONE JUST A LITTLE BIT
[ct=1586.482] BEHIND KUPP.
[ct=1590.434] ALL THE OPTION ROUTES HE HAS
[ct=1592.784] UNDERNEATH, HE CAN GO LEFT, CAN
[ct=1593.515] SET THE GOT UP AND GO RIGHT.
[ct=1596.406] THAT TIME I THINK DAY READ IT.
[ct=1599.626] THEY WERE ON THE SAME PACE BUT
[ct=1600.389] THAT WAS A RARE MISS FOR
[ct=1600.615] STAFFORD.
[ct=1603.295] YOU JUST ASSUME IT WILL BE
[ct=1603.865] ACCURATE EVERY THROW.
[ct=1608.585] AL: HE WAS A CATCHER IN HIGH
[ct=1611.074] SCHOOL AND HE CAUGHT CLAYTON
[ct=1611.690] KERSHAW.
[ct=1616.379] REFEREE: TIMEOUT.
[ct=1619.972] 30-SECOND TIMEOUT.
[ct=1624.278] AL: EVERYONE KNOWS THE STORY OF
[ct=1625.837] BASEBALL AND FOOTBALL, CLAYTON
[ct=1628.503] KIRK: HIGHLAND PARK OUT OF
[ct=1630.319] DALLAS, RIGHT?
[ct=1633.530] AL: WHAT A STORY THAT WILL BE
[ct=1635.145] WITH THE DODGERS.THE LAKE.
[ct=1638.347] KIRK: A LOT OF UNDERNEATH SHOTS.
[ct=1640.720] AT SOME POINT THEY WILL TRY TO
[ct=1644.211] SNEAK BEHIND THE COVERAGE.
[ct=1646.446] KIND OF SETTING THEM UP TO GET
[ct=1646.776] THE DOUBLE MOVE.
[ct=1648.531] AL: SECOND AND 10.
[ct=1650.962] GOES THE OTHER WAY.
[ct=1655.163] WILLIAMS SLIPS A TACKLE, SLIPS
[ct=1658.946] ANOTHER ONE AND MAKES A LITTLE
[ct=1659.183] SOMETHING OUT OF NOTHING AS TIME
[ct=1661.533] WINDS DOWN AND THE FIRST QUARTER
[ct=1661.533] IS OVER.
[ct=1664.685] END OF ONE.
[ct=1672.173] KAYLEE: JUSTIN JEFFERSON WITH 68
[ct=1672.173] YARDS ON FIVE CATCHES.
[ct=1674.300] HOW HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO GET
[ct=1674.563] HIM GOING?
[ct=1678.841] KEVIN: FIRST AND FOREMOST I LIKE
[ct=1679.602] WHAT WE ARE DOING AT THE LINE OF
[ct=1679.894] SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=1681.479] GETTING THE RUN GAME GOING.
[ct=1684.385] JUSTIN IS FINDING SOME SPACE
[ct=1684.629] BECAUSE OF THAT.
[ct=1687.281] WE HAVE SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN
[ct=1687.576] OUR GUYS.
[ct=1689.681] SAM IS PLAYING GREAT.
[ct=1691.590] WE ARE OFF TO A GOOD START.
[ct=1693.919] KAYLEE: SEAN MCVAY HAS HIS
[ct=1695.230] OFFENSE HUMMING.
[ct=1697.628] HOW DO YOU SLOW THEM DOWN?
[ct=1701.454] KEVIN: WE KNOW SEAN WILL CALL A
[ct=1701.723] GREAT GAME.
[ct=1704.637] WE HAVE TO PLAY COMPLEMENTARY
[ct=1706.411] FOOTBALL AND GET OFF THE FIELD
[ct=1706.761] HERE ON A CRITICAL THIRD DOWN.
[ct=1709.972] AL: INDEED THEY GET OFF THE
[ct=1710.752] FIELD, BUT THERE IS A FLAG.
[ct=1713.205] THAT WAS A THIRD AND 7.
[ct=1719.834] REFEREE: HOLDING, DEFENSE,
[ct=1719.834] NUMBER 7.
[ct=1723.828] FIVE YARD PENALTY, AUTOMATIC
[ct=1728.056] AL: THEY GOT OFF THE FIELD BUT
[ct=1728.633] ONLY MOMENTARILY BECAUSE THE
[ct=1730.152] FLAG WAS ON BYRON MURPHY.
[ct=1735.921] KIRK: THE PLAY WENT
[ct=1736.440] EXACTLY THE WAY BRIAN FLORES
[ct=1736.723] WOULD WANT.
[ct=1739.942] THIRD AND 7 AND THEN BRING THE
[ct=1742.363] PRESSURE.
[ct=1742.850] THIS ENDS UP BEING THE HOLDING
[ct=1743.302] CALL ON MURPHY.
[ct=1746.248] I DID NOT SEE MUCH OF ANYTHING.
[ct=1749.773] IF IT WAS ON 7, THERE WAS NOT A
[ct=1751.137] HOLD THERE.
[ct=1753.720] AL: ROBINSON.
[ct=1757.719] MEANWHILE, GREAT MOVES BY
[ct=1763.030] I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, THIS KID
[ct=1763.030] DOES NOT GET A LOT OF ATTENTION.
[ct=1765.688] HE NEEDS TO START GETTING A LOT
[ct=1765.688] MORE.
[ct=1767.023] A BEAUTIFUL RUN.
[ct=1768.579] 18 YARDS.
[ct=1771.212] KIRK: HE BRINGS GREAT ENERGY.
[ct=1773.047] GREAT BLOCK AND THEN WATCH PUKA
[ct=1775.733] GET UP TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND
[ct=1776.003] SEAL THE EDGE.
[ct=1778.390] PUKA IS ABLE TO GET UP ON STEFON
[ct=1778.710] GILMORE.
[ct=1781.709] THIS GUY IS NOT LOOKING TO RUN
[ct=1781.989] OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=1785.000] HE WAS THE SAME WAY IN COLLEGE
[ct=1785.504] AT NOTRE DAME.
[ct=1791.856] THIS OFFENSIVE LINE FEEDS OFF OF
[ct=1792.063] THE RUN.
[ct=1794.719] AL: HE COMES OUT FOR THE MOMENT.
[ct=1797.827] CORUM, THE ROOKIE OUT OF
[ct=1799.978] MICHIGAN, WHO HAD A TREMENDOUS
[ct=1800.522] COLLEGE CAREER.
[ct=1801.563] SHORT AGAIN.
[ct=1806.943] KIRK: HE IS SIMILAR AS FAR AS
[ct=1807.160] PERSONALITY AND MAKEUP.
[ct=1810.939] IT DID NOT SURPRISE ME WHEN LES
[ct=1813.136] SNEAD DECIDED TO PULL THE
[ct=1813.390] TRIGGER.
[ct=1817.991] KYREN WILLIAMS ALREADY, 116
[ct=1819.683] CARRIES COMING INTO TONIGHT.
[ct=1821.279] THAT IS A LOT.
[ct=1826.867] AS THE SEASON GOES ALONG, YOU
[ct=1828.161] WILL HAVE TO GIVE BLAKE CORUM
[ct=1829.537] MORE AND MORE CARRIES AND SEE
[ct=1830.323] WHAT HE CAN DO AS A ROOKIE.
[ct=1833.800] AL: HE PLAYED WITH J.J.
[ct=1834.918] MCCARTHY.
[ct=1841.470] THE PASS IS CAUGHT AND TO THE 14
[ct=1842.868] YARD LINE, NACUA.
[ct=1844.376] WHAT A NIGHT.
[ct=1846.898] PICKING UP WHERE HE LEFT OFF
[ct=1847.137] LAST SEASON.
[ct=1849.111] KIRK: NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
[ct=1851.594] WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE
[ct=1851.856] ROOKIE.
[ct=1853.729] THEY WILL CHALLENGE HIM RIGHT
[ct=1853.974] AWAY.
[ct=1856.448] YOU HAVE TO PICK THAT UP AND HE
[ct=1860.391] JUST GETS ENOUGH OF IVAN PACE
[ct=1861.743] GIVE MATTHEW STAFFORD ENOUGH
[ct=1862.240] ROOM TO GET THAT BALL OUT.
[ct=1866.137] THE BEAUTIFUL HANDS OF NACUA TO
[ct=1866.724] PULL THAT ONE IN FOR THE FIRST
[ct=1869.241] GREAT LOOK AT THAT PASS
[ct=1869.518] PROTECTION.
[ct=1873.115] A BIG EMPHASIS THIS WEEK AGAINST
[ct=1873.596] THOSE LINEBACKERS.
[ct=1876.051] AL: WILLIAMS IS BACK IN.
[ct=1880.487] MEANWHILE, THE END AROUND, HERE
[ct=1882.497] COMES NACUA AGAIN, TO THE
[ct=1884.452] LINE.
[ct=1888.468] PUKA NACUA, FIFTH ROUND DRAFT
[ct=1888.667] CHOICE OUT OF BYU.
[ct=1891.593] EXPLODED ON THE SCENE LAST YEAR
[ct=1891.865] WITH THE RAMS.
[ct=1894.235] TREMENDOUS ROOKIE SEASON.
[ct=1897.499] KIRK: JUST TO REMIND PEOPLE,
[ct=1899.250] THIS GUY IS A BIG, BIG RECEIVER.
[ct=1901.631] HE IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL RECEIVER.
[ct=1905.626] BOTH HE AND COOPER KUPP, THEY
[ct=1909.386] ARE NOT THE GUY IN THE SLOT WHO
[ct=1909.386] HAS WIGGLE.
[ct=1909.971] THEY ARE BIG GUYS.
[ct=1912.104] HE HAS ACCELERATION.
[ct=1914.520] AL: SECOND AND 3.
[ct=1920.054] EIGHTS PLAY OF THE DRIVE.
[ct=1922.465] WILLIAMS GETS TAKEN DOWN.
[ct=1926.670] THE RAMS PICKED A GUY NAMED
[ct=1929.542] NACUA, YOU THINK HE WOULD BE
[ct=1930.854] 5'7".
[ct=1933.532] I AM WITH YOU.
[ct=1936.141] AL: HE IS A STUD.
[ct=1941.010] KIRK: KYREN WILLIAMS, MATTHEW
[ct=1945.672] STAFFORD, 16TH YEAR, 36 YEARS
[ct=1946.491] OLD, YOU BRING IN GUYS AROUND
[ct=1947.916] HIM.
[ct=1951.038] IT IS NICE TO SEE HOW THEY HAVE
[ct=1951.242] BROUGHT IN PIECES TO BRING THE
[ct=1951.561] ENERGY.
[ct=1955.221] NOW YOU HAVE A BIG THIRD DOWN
[ct=1956.036] FOR BRIAN FLORES AND THE VIKINGS
[ct=1956.354] DEFENSE.
[ct=1958.727] KYREN WILLIAMS BACK IN THE
[ct=1959.169] BACKFIELD NEXT TO STAFFORD.
[ct=1965.192] AL: COLBY PARKINSON, THE TIGHT
[ct=1965.428] END.
[ct=1967.258] THEY HAVE TRIPS TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=1969.162] NOW, A FLAG.
[ct=1972.583] IT LOOK LIKE JACKSON MOVED, THE
[ct=1972.875] LEFT TACKLE.
[ct=1983.549] REFEREE: FALSE START, OFFENSE,
[ct=1985.304] NUMBER 77.
[ct=1986.134] FIVE YARD PENALTY.
[ct=1988.653] KIRK: IF IT WASN'T GOING TO BE A
[ct=1991.748] FALSE START BY JACKSON, IT IS
[ct=1994.496] HARD TO STAY IN THERE ON THIRD
[ct=1995.796] AND SHORT, IT WAS GOING TO BE A
[ct=1995.973] DELAY OF GAME.
[ct=1999.772] YOU SEE STAFFORD TRYING TO HURRY
[ct=2000.254] OUT.
[ct=2000.559] YOU HAVE A ROOKIE CENTER.
[ct=2004.406] A LITTLE MISCOMMUNICATION PUSHES
[ct=2004.949] THEM BACK ON THIRD AND 7.
[ct=2007.833] AL: THEY HAVE ALREADY USED TWO
[ct=2010.865] TIMEOUTS BECAUSE OF THE PLAY
[ct=2010.865] CLOCK ALREADY.
[ct=2013.159] THIRD DOWN AND 7.
[ct=2018.906] TRIPS TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=2020.634] STAFFORD LOOKS THAT WAY.
[ct=2023.054] IT IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=2026.041] KUPP WAS COVERED, BUT YET
[ct=2026.242] ANOTHER FLAG.
[ct=2028.336] THEY GET A BREAK ON AN EARLIER
[ct=2030.475] FLAG, GILMORE WAS THERE WITH
[ct=2030.822] KUPP.
[ct=2036.632] KIRK: I THINK GILMORE GOT OUT OF
[ct=2038.200] POSITION AND HAD TO PLAY
[ct=2038.200] CATCH-UP.
[ct=2043.009] HE GOT OUT-FLANKED FROM THE
[ct=2043.262] BUNCH LOOK.
[ct=2045.928] THEY WENT TO A THREE-RECEIVER
[ct=2048.823] LOOK SO GILMORE HAS TO TRY TO
[ct=2050.625] WORK THROUGH SOME TRAFFIC AND
[ct=2051.216] NOW IT IS A FOOT RACE.
[ct=2055.176] THE BALL BEING UNDERTHROWN MAKES
[ct=2055.493] GILMORE RUN INTO COOPER KUPP.
[ct=2060.183] GOOD CONFUSION WITH THAT
[ct=2060.493] PRE-SNAP MOTION.
[ct=2065.306] SLOWED GILMORE, A LITTLE
[ct=2066.420] HESITANT, TO ALLOW COOPER KUPP
[ct=2066.971] TO GET OUTSIDE.
[ct=2068.891] AL: FIRST AND GOAL.
[ct=2075.850] RAMS OUT OF A TIGHT FORMATION.
[ct=2080.043] TAKEN DOWN IN THE BACKFIELD,
[ct=2082.462] THAT WAS PACE COMING THROUGH.
[ct=2083.834] IVAN PACE.
[ct=2086.473] SECOND YEAR OUT OF CINCINNATI.
[ct=2090.420] KNOX DOWN WILLIAMS.
[ct=2090.420] IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=2092.440] KIRK: THIS IS WHAT HE IS KNOWN
[ct=2092.681] FOR.
[ct=2098.990] YOU SEE METELLUS.
[ct=2102.519] BOTH OF THE BACKERS ARE
[ct=2103.020] PROTECTING.
[ct=2107.234] THE AMOUNT OF BIG BODIES THEY
[ct=2107.234] HAVE UPFRONT.
[ct=2110.922] EASY TACKLE THAT TIME FOR PACE.
[ct=2116.550] AL: VIKINGS MINUS BLAKE CASHMAN
[ct=2116.550] TONIGHT.
[ct=2118.642] HE LEADS THE TEAM IN TACKLES.
[ct=2125.006] STAFFORD CHASED, ESCAPES, FIRES,
[ct=2125.350] CAUGHT, TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=2127.207] COOPER KUPP.
[ct=2133.272] KIRK: ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?
[ct=2135.740] 36 YEARS OLD.
[ct=2138.313] HE IS A GREAT ATHLETE.
[ct=2142.481] WHAT A JOB, THE RAMS ANSWERING
[ct=2142.703] SAM DARNOLD.
[ct=2149.156] WATCH THIS BEEN MOVE BY BERNARD.
[ct=2151.327] HE HAS A CHANCE FOR THE SACK.
[ct=2154.930] THE BIG FELLA, HARRISON
[ct=2154.930] PHILLIPS.
[ct=2157.570] I KNOW STAFFORD WILL FEEL GOOD
[ct=2157.788] ABOUT THAT.
[ct=2161.542] HE GETS OUT AND HAS THE VISION
[ct=2163.659] DOWNFIELD TO FIND HIS MAIN GUY,
[ct=2163.937] 10, KUPP.
[ct=2167.253] AL: JOSHUA KARTY FOR THE POINT
[ct=2167.253] AFTER.
[ct=2174.549] AND WITH 10:05 TO GO IN THE
[ct=2175.148] FIRST HALF, WE HAVE A TRACK

[ct=2198.570] SUNDAY IN LAS VEGAS.
[ct=2201.270] ONE OF THEIR TWO MEETINGS THIS
[ct=2201.489] SEASON.
[ct=2203.938] 28 POINTS ON THE BOARD.
[ct=2208.108] THE RAMS TO KICK OFF.
[ct=2211.684] ETHAN EVANS.
[ct=2213.668] DOES IT AGAIN.
[ct=2217.585] KAYLEE: JUST FORLD GAVE HIM
[ct=2219.847] THE NOD TO COME OVER.
[ct=2222.911] THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION OF
[ct=2223.147] TECHNIQUE.
[ct=2227.950] DONALD CALMED THE ROOKIE'S
[ct=2227.950] NERVES.
[ct=2231.138] SAID IT IS JUST FOOTBALL, DON'T
[ct=2231.736] LET IT GO TO YOUR HEAD.
[ct=2234.863] AL: TY CHANDLER IS NOW THE
[ct=2234.863] RUNNING BACK.
[ct=2238.212] NUMBER 32, AARON JONES, RESTING
[ct=2238.501] FOR THE MOMENT.
[ct=2241.277] MOTION, AND WE HAVE A FLAG.
[ct=2244.378] KIRK: EVERYBODY MOVING ON THE
[ct=2245.185] BALL DID NOT COME UP FROM
[ct=2246.861] BRADBURY, THE CENTER.
[ct=2255.506] NUMBER 64.
[ct=2257.644] FIVE YARD PENALTY, STILL FIRST
[ct=2261.622] KIRK: THE EXECUTED SO FLAWLESSLY
[ct=2262.965] THE FIRST TWO DRIVES.
[ct=2265.668] HOW ABOUT SAM DARNOLD IN THE
[ct=2266.193] FIRST QUARTER THIS SEASON?
[ct=2273.954] 81% OF HIS PASSES, 418, SIX
[ct=2274.191] TOUCHDOWNS, NO INTERCEPTIONS, A
[ct=2277.470] 143 QB RATING.
[ct=2283.087] AL: THE VIKINGS OFFENSIVE LINE
[ct=2284.887] HAS STAYED HEALTHY, SANE FIVE
[ct=2285.386] STARTERS EVERY GAME.
[ct=2287.736] THEY HAVE MISSED ONLY NINE
[ct=2287.976] SNAPS.
[ct=2299.665] KIRK: I DON'T THINK THE VIKINGS
[ct=2299.665] HAD THE RIGHT FORMATION.
[ct=2303.959] REFEREE: ILLEGAL FORMATION,
[ct=2304.214] OFFENSE.
[ct=2307.344] KIRK: DÉJÀ VU.
[ct=2310.436] AN AREA THEY WANTED TO CLEAN UP.
[ct=2315.236] REFEREE: CORRECTION, THE PENALTY
[ct=2315.557] WILL BE DECLINED.
[ct=2321.956] AL: THE RAMS WILL TAKE THE PLAY
[ct=2324.484] AND MAKE IT SECOND DOWN AND 15
[ct=2324.767] INSTEAD OF FIRST AND 20.
[ct=2330.778] MEANWHILE, KAM CURL, WHO GOT
[ct=2332.663] HURT EARLIER, IS NOW BACK AT
[ct=2332.944] SAFETY.
[ct=2340.050] SECOND AND 15.
[ct=2343.417] JJ IN MOTION.
[ct=2345.389] GETS A BLOCK.
[ct=2351.681] UP TO THE 31-YARD LINE, TACKLED
[ct=2354.999] BY JAYLEN MCCOLLOUGH.
[ct=2358.968] KIRK: GIVES THEM A SHOT ON THIRD
[ct=2362.968] INTERESTING THE RAMS LET THE
[ct=2362.968] SECOND PENALTY GO.
[ct=2364.523] NOW WE HAVE THIRD DOWN.
[ct=2367.153] SEE IF THEY CAN DIAL UP SOME
[ct=2369.678] THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO
[ct=2369.947] THAT.
[ct=2372.144] EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE BLITZED,
[ct=2375.241] DARNOLD HAS BEEN UNTOUCHED, VERY
[ct=2375.742] CLEAN POCKET.
[ct=2378.342] THEY HAVE GOOD PASS RUSHERS.
[ct=2380.446] SEE IF THEY CAN GET AFTER HIM.
[ct=2383.349] AL: THIRD AND 9.
[ct=2385.524] LOOK OUT FROM BEHIND.
[ct=2389.466] DARNOLD FEELS IT, STEPS FORWARD
[ct=2390.531] BUT THE THROW IS LOW AND
[ct=2393.425] FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE GAME,
[ct=2393.850] WE HAVE A FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=2401.444] KIRK: VERSE DOES A GOOD JOB FROM
[ct=2402.999] BEHIND HERE.
[ct=2405.387] THE PUSH IN THE INTERIOR FROM
[ct=2408.437] MICHAEL HOECHT AFFECTED HIM.
[ct=2412.549] FINALLY, WE SEE A DEFENSE GET
[ct=2412.824] THE OPPOSING
[ct=2414.657] FIELD.
[ct=2418.697] AL: FIRST PUNT OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=2420.533] RYAN WRIGHT.
[ct=2425.358] XAVIER SMITH SETS UP INSIDE HIS
[ct=2425.358] 25.
[ct=2428.244] DRIFTS OVER TO THE FAR SIDE.
[ct=2429.622] GOOD KICK.
[ct=2432.217] FIELDED OUT THE 9.
[ct=2435.136] NO ROOM TO ROAM.
[ct=2436.696] TACKLED AT THE 13.
[ct=2442.388] NORMALLY VEGGIES, BABY, NO
[ct=2444.839] VEGGIES.
[ct=2446.830] YOU KNOW WHO ELSE DOES NOT EAT
[ct=2448.095] VEGGIES?
[ct=2449.221] PUKA NACUA.
[ct=2452.413] KIRK: THAT IS WHAT YOU WERE
[ct=2453.290] TRYING TO FIND HIM ON THE FIELD
[ct=2453.579] BEFORE THE GAME.
[ct=2455.393] AL: ANDREW WHITWORTH.
[ct=2458.130] A GAIN OF A COUPLE FROM BLAKE
[ct=2462.048] CORUM, STARTING ON THIS DRIVE.
[ct=2462.253] UNDER NINE MINUTES TO PLAY.
[ct=2465.193] GAME TIED AT 14-14.
[ct=2467.321] KIRK: WE SAW THE DEFENSE OF THE
[ct=2471.061] RAMS MAKING ADJUSTMENTS, HELPING
[ct=2471.654] TO GET THE VIKINGS TO MAKE
[ct=2471.862] MISTAKES.
[ct=2475.811] AFTER A GREAT PUNT, LET'S SEE IF
[ct=2477.718] THIS VIKINGS DEFENSE CAN COME UP
[ct=2478.337] WITH SOME ANSWERS.
[ct=2480.423] THEY HAVE STAFFORD AND THE RAMS
[ct=2482.240] PINNED.
[ct=2485.669] WE ARE WATCHING TWO OF THE BEST
[ct=2489.675] PLAY CALLERS GO AT IT TONIGHT.
[ct=2493.691] AL: FLAG.
[ct=2500.523] REFEREE: PRIOR TO THE SNAP,
[ct=2503.076] FALSE START, OFFENSE, NUMBER 50.
[ct=2506.179] FIVE YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2510.413] KIRK: THAT IS BEAUX LIMMER, THE
[ct=2510.751] ROOKIE CENTER.
[ct=2514.206] AL: JUST A FLINCH BY THE CENTER.
[ct=2518.341] CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING IN A
[ct=2519.781] ROOKIE IN A GAME LIKE THIS
[ct=2520.272] AGAINST THIS DEFENSE?
[ct=2522.518] HE IS WORRIED ABOUT A LOT OF
[ct=2522.835] THINGS.
[ct=2526.770] PROTECTION, SLIDING RIGHT,
[ct=2526.972] SLIDING LEFT.
[ct=2528.940] HE JUST MOVES A LITTLE BIT.
[ct=2532.045] THAT PUSHES THE RAMS BACK EVEN
[ct=2532.297] FURTHER.
[ct=2534.921] AL: KUPP.
[ct=2537.363] WITH BLOCKING.
[ct=2543.968] HE GETS OUT TO ABOUT THE 13-YARD
[ct=2546.119] HE GOT A BLOCK FROM COLBY
[ct=2546.374] PARKINSON.
[ct=2549.685] THE RAMS NOW WITH A THIRD DOWN
[ct=2550.419] AND 9.
[ct=2557.652] WITHOUT A HUDDLE.
[ct=2566.940] THREE-MAN RUSH.
[ct=2569.621] STAFFORD, LOOK OUT.
[ct=2571.161] AVOIDS THE SAFETY.
[ct=2578.943] REFEREE: THERE IS NO FOUL FOR
[ct=2579.408] INTENTIONAL GROUNDING, THERE WAS
[ct=2581.637] AN ELIGIBLE RECEIVER IN THE
[ct=2581.879] AREA.
[ct=2584.122] AL: HE STARTED TO STUMBLE.
[ct=2589.338] REFEREE: ILLEGAL HANDS TO THE
[ct=2589.941] FACE, DEFENSE, NUMBER 52.
[ct=2591.499] AL: WHOA.
[ct=2596.030] REFEREE: FIVE YARD PENALTY,
[ct=2596.359] AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2599.637] AL: THAT IS THE THIRD TIME THE
[ct=2603.134] RAMS HAVE FAILED ON THIRD DOWN
[ct=2603.684] AND THE VIKINGS HANDED THEM A
[ct=2603.942] GIFT.
[ct=2606.001] KIRK: WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE
[ct=2606.277] CENTER.
[ct=2610.004] HE GETS A DOUBLE TEAM AND THE
[ct=2610.541] LEFT-HAND GETS UP INTO THE FACE.
[ct=2613.543] FIRST YOU HEARD HIM SAY THERE
[ct=2615.071] WAS NO FOUL FOR INTENTIONAL
[ct=2615.324] GROUNDING.
[ct=2619.572] THERE IS A GREAT LOOK AT THE
[ct=2621.506] HAND IT TO THE FACE OF THE
[ct=2623.870] YOU ARE RIGHT, THE RAMS CATCH A
[ct=2623.870] BREAK.
[ct=2625.437] AL: THREE TIMES.
[ct=2627.735] HALFWAY THROUGH THE QUARTER.
[ct=2630.163] FROM THE 17.
[ct=2631.995] CORUM IS THE RUNNING BACK.
[ct=2635.432] GIVE IT TO THE MICHIGAN ROOKIE.
[ct=2639.417] UP TO THE 22-YARD LINE HE GOES.
[ct=2642.135] KIRK: THIS KID
[ct=2643.429] TACKLES.
[ct=2644.836] HE IS 5’
[ct=2648.803] HE IS 5'8", ABOUT 210 POUNDS.
[ct=2652.757] HE COMPLEMENTS KYREN WILLIAMS.
[ct=2658.078] LOOKING TO PROVE HIMSELF AND RUN
[ct=2659.501] WITH A GREAT DEAL OF ENERGY AND
[ct=2660.032] PASSION ANYTIME HE GETS A
[ct=2660.360] CHANCE.
[ct=2664.339] WE ALREADY SAW THE PASS PRO HE
[ct=2664.940] HAD EARLIER THAT HELPED STAFFORD
[ct=2669.177] MOVEMENT AGAIN, THIS TIME ON THE
[ct=2669.372] RIGHT SIDE.
[ct=2671.224] IT LOOKED LIKE 87.
[ct=2677.246] NUMBER 79.
[ct=2679.420] FIVE YARD PENALTY, STILL SECOND
[ct=2682.611] AL: THEY CALL THAT ON THE
[ct=2683.947] TACKLE, HAVENSTEIN.
[ct=2689.282] KIRK: EVERYTHING HAS BEEN SO
[ct=2691.557] FLAWLESS FOR BOTH OF THESE
[ct=2693.582] OFFENSES.
[ct=2695.923] AND THEN THIRD TIME, FOR BOTH
[ct=2698.752] SIDES, MAKING MISTAKES.
[ct=2701.248] AL: HARD TO KEEP UP THAT PACE.
[ct=2705.271] YEAH, NO DOUBT.
[ct=2710.447] AL: KYREN WILLIAMS IS BACK ON
[ct=2710.447] SECOND AND 10.
[ct=2712.021] HE GETS IT.
[ct=2713.340] LOOKS FOR ROOM.
[ct=2716.820] THREADS HIS WAY TO A GAIN OF 8
[ct=2718.980] -- AND ANOTHER FLAG.
[ct=2723.460] AFTER A MOSTLY FLAG-FREE FIRST
[ct=2725.956] QUARTER, A TON HERE IN THE
[ct=2726.214] SECOND.
[ct=2739.535] REFEREE: HOLDING, OFFENSE,
[ct=2739.847] NUMBER 50.
[ct=2743.278] 10-YARD PENALTY, SECOND DOWN.
[ct=2745.460] AL: THAT IS BEAUX LIMMER AGAIN.
[ct=2747.638] A TOUGH NIGHT FOR HIM.
[ct=2751.566] THEY ARE MINUS TWO STARTING
[ct=2752.351] LINEMEN.
[ct=2755.250] THE ROOKIE IN AT CENTER HAVING A
[ct=2755.662] TOUGH ONE.
[ct=2759.507] KIRK: THE BACK SIDE DOES SUCH A
[ct=2760.040] GOOD JOB ON THE ZONE PLAY.
[ct=2762.344] RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE IS THE HOLD
[ct=2764.781] AGAINST PACE WITH LIMMER.
[ct=2769.807] LOOK AT THAT HOLE OPEN UP ON THE
[ct=2769.807] BACKSIDE.
[ct=2771.028] GREAT VISION.
[ct=2775.222] AL: SECOND AND 20.
[ct=2779.271] TRYING TO SET UP A SCREEN BUT
[ct=2779.558] NOTHING HAPPENING HERE.
[ct=2783.919] BUSTING THAT PLAY UP IS VAN
[ct=2783.919] GINKEL.
[ct=2787.386] KYREN WILLIAMS MADE THE CATCH.
[ct=2790.364] VAN GINKEL CAME OVER FROM THE
[ct=2790.629] DOLPHINS.
[ct=2795.443] KIRK: I TALKED TO HIM ON THE
[ct=2795.697] FIELD BEFORE THE GAME ABOUT
[ct=2795.950] WISCONSIN.
[ct=2797.324] HE WAS A GREAT PLAYER.
[ct=2801.623] I ASKED, DID YOU PLAYOFF BALL
[ct=2805.031] BACKER IN COLLEGE?
[ct=2806.859] HE SAID I DID NOT REALLY.
[ct=2809.975] HE SAID I AM ENJOYING THE
[ct=2810.239] OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=2813.648] AL: THIRD AND 18.
[ct=2816.584] WILLIAMS TAKES IT OUT TO THE 22.
[ct=2818.861] THEY WILL BRING IN THE PUNT
[ct=2822.227] GROUP FOR THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT
[ct=2823.818] WITH A LITTLE LESS THAN 5:30 TO
[ct=2824.078] GO IN THE HALF.
[ct=2827.158] KIRK: BOTH OFFENSES AFTER
[ct=2828.851] TOUCHDOWNS ON THEIR FIRST TWO
[ct=2831.699] DRIVES SELF-DESTRUCTIVE BIT AND
[ct=2836.160] CAUSE THEM TO NOT HAVE THE
[ct=2836.747] ABILITY TO SUSTAIN DRIVES.
[ct=2839.359] THE DEFENSES FINALLY GET STOPS.
[ct=2845.404] AL: ETHAN EVANS SENDS IT DOWN
[ct=2846.004] TOWARD BRANDON POWELL.
[ct=2853.321] POWELL CATCHES IT AT THE 36.
[ct=2856.149] AND RUNS IT BACK OUT TO THE
[ct=2858.345] 44-YARD LINE.
[ct=2864.641] RAMSAL: FOUR DIFFERENT TEAMS BEF
[ct=2864.903] TURNING 28.
[ct=2867.011] THREE TEAMS IN THREE YEARS.
[ct=2870.032] LAST YEAR AT SAN FRANCISCO,
[ct=2871.261] BACKING UP PURDY.
[ct=2875.781] IT WAS A FREE AGENT, LOOK AROUND
[ct=2876.615] AND FELT THAT MINNESOTA WAS THE
[ct=2876.898] RIGHT FIT.
[ct=2879.906] FROM THE 42.
[ct=2881.656] GOOD PLAY FAKE.
[ct=2885.972] PROTECTION BREAKS DOWN AND
[ct=2889.392] TACKLED, THAT IS VERSE WITH THE
[ct=2891.458] SACK AT THE 30-YARD LINE.
[ct=2896.354] KIRK: WHAT AN IMPRESSIVE ROOKIE
[ct=2898.875] YEAR THAT JARED VERSE IS
[ct=2898.875] ENJOYING.
[ct=2901.482] YOU KNEW IT WAS A MATTER OF
[ct=2901.482] TIME.
[ct=2904.531] THIS WAS UP AGAINST THE TIDE
[ct=2904.531] DAN, JOSH OLIVER.
[ct=2909.827] HE HAS 32 PRESSURES, 15TH IN THE
[ct=2910.359] NFL AS A ROOKIE.
[ct=2912.574] YOU KNEW ME EVENTUALLY HE WOULD
[ct=2914.815] GET HOME AND COME UP WITH PLAYS
[ct=2914.815] LIKE THIS.
[ct=2918.083] IT IS MORE OF A BULL RUSH,
[ct=2919.337] POWER.
[ct=2924.373] HE HAS TWITCH BUT THIS WAS MORE
[ct=2924.985] ABOUT OVERPOWERING THE MAN
[ct=2925.344] ACROSS FROM HIM.
[ct=2932.318] KIRK: ANOTHER PRE-SNAP PENALTY.
[ct=2937.779] NUMBER 71.
[ct=2940.688] FIVE YARD PENALTY, SECOND DOWN.
[ct=2943.960] AL: HOW ABOUT HAVING THE
[ct=2947.326] AWARENESS TO SAY, WAIT A SECOND
[ct=2948.649] -- I AM PLAYING IN A STADIUM OR
[ct=2950.355] A LOT OF TIMES THE VISITING FANS
[ct=2954.247] OVERWHELM THE HOME FANS -- NOT
[ct=2955.893] NECESSARILY TONIGHT -- BUT
[ct=2959.553] GIVING THE SIGN FOR THE "SKOL."
[ct=2962.768] KIRK: THIS IS OUR HOUSE, I DON'T
[ct=2963.052] NEED TO SEE THAT.
[ct=2967.430] AL: SECOND DOWN AND 25.
[ct=2969.615] LOOK OUT AGAIN!
[ct=2975.553] AVOIDS THE SACK, CHASED AND
[ct=2976.356] FIRES THAT ONE AWAY, INCOMPLETE.
[ct=2979.549] BYRON YOUNG WAS CHASING HIM.
[ct=2980.731] THIRD AND 25.
[ct=2985.446] KIRK: THEY USE FISKE, ANOTHER
[ct=2987.656] ROOKIE OUT OF FLORIDA STATE.
[ct=2990.311] YOUNG WILL WORK UNDERNEATH.
[ct=2995.739] THE LEFT GUARD, BRANDEL.
[ct=3000.056] ZERO ON ONE SIDE, EIGHT ON THE
[ct=3000.380] OTHER.
[ct=3004.739] THOSE TWO ARE REALLY DANGEROUS
[ct=3005.223] OFF THE EDGE FOR THIS RAMS
[ct=3012.168] KIRK: 3 -- AL: 3:30 UNTIL
[ct=3012.485] HALFTIME.
[ct=3019.825] RUSH THREE, DROP EIGHT.
[ct=3022.543] 35-YARD LINE.
[ct=3027.888] JALEN NAILOR, HIS FIRST CATCH OF
[ct=3028.117] THE NIGHT.
[ct=3030.071] FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=3033.224] KIRK: BACK TO WHAT CHRIS SHULA
[ct=3035.008] TOLD US ABOUT DEFENDING THIS
[ct=3037.819] WE HAVE TO GET NEGATIVE PLAYS.
[ct=3040.068] WE HAVE TO GET THEM BEHIND THE
[ct=3040.336] STICKS.
[ct=3043.936] WITH THE SNAP AND PENALTY,
[ct=3046.198] SECOND STRAIGHT SERIES THEY GOT
[ct=3047.814] THEM BEHIND THE STICKS AND GOT
[ct=3048.566] THEM OFF THE FIELD.
[ct=3055.770] AL: RYAN WRIGHT'S SECOND KICK.
[ct=3064.091] AL: SOFI STADIUM IN INGLEWOOD ON
[ct=3064.674] THIS THURSDAY NIGHT.
[ct=3066.843] EACH TEAM SCORING ON ITS FIRST
[ct=3070.835] TWO DRIVES AND NOW NOTHING BUT A
[ct=3074.843] SLOWED DOWN GAME AND PONCE.
[ct=3077.462] THE RAMS WILL BEGIN THIS DRIVE
[ct=3079.282] FROM THEIR OWN 11-YARD LINE.
[ct=3086.801] OUT OF A TIGHT FORMATION.
[ct=3092.482] MCVEIGH IS GREAT.
[ct=3095.704] HE IS AN OFFENSIVE GENIUS.
[ct=3100.220] THEY USE MORE TIGHT FORMATIONS
[ct=3100.781] THAN ANY OTHER TEAM IN THE
[ct=3101.162] LEAGUE.
[ct=3104.400] KIRK: HE IS REALLY THE GUY WHO
[ct=3104.903] HAS MADE IT A TREND.
[ct=3107.693] GOING BACK SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS
[ct=3107.693] AGO.
[ct=3110.478] SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE COPIED THAT.
[ct=3115.342] IT HELPS YOU IN THE RUNNING GAME
[ct=3115.653] AS MUCH AS ANYTHING.
[ct=3118.228] IF YOU HAVE RECEIVERS WHO CAN
[ct=3118.467] SET THE EDGE.
[ct=3122.776] IT CREATES SPACE OUTSIDE OF THE
[ct=3123.362] PERIMETER FOR THE RECEIVERS TO
[ct=3125.211] WORK ON THE SECOND LEVEL ROUTES.
[ct=3127.282] AL: SECOND AND 6.
[ct=3134.040] THROWS TO PARKINSON, HIS TIGHT
[ct=3137.730] COLBY PARKINSON, OUT OF
[ct=3142.752] A TIMEOUT TAKEN -- ACTUALLY, IT
[ct=3145.651] IS THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=3157.538] AL: OUR OWN 55, ANDREW
[ct=3158.866] WHITWORTH, THERE HE IS, HOW
[ct=3159.968] ABOUT ENDING YOUR CAREER HERE IN
[ct=3162.921] THE SUPER BOWL WITH A VICTORY.
[ct=3165.634] KIRK: MASSIVE.
[ct=3169.847] AL: THAT MAN WILL BE IN THE HALL
[ct=3170.119] OF FAME SOMEDAY.
[ct=3172.403] NO QUESTION IN MY MIND.
[ct=3175.303] FROM THE 23 YARD LINE.
[ct=3182.049] WILLIAMS, ONE FOR 12 AFTER THE
[ct=3182.049] 35.
[ct=3184.750] THE RAMS, BECAUSE THEY USE TWO
[ct=3186.208] TIMEOUTS, HAVE ONLY ONE IN THE
[ct=3187.006] FINAL TWO MINUTES HERE.
[ct=3189.999] KIRK: ONE OF THE BIG STORIES
[ct=3190.296] THIS FIRST HALF IS STAFFORD.
[ct=3193.883] WHIT WOULD BE PROUD OF WHAT HE'S
[ct=3196.180] SEEN FROM THIS OFFENSE ALONE,
[ct=3197.041] ESPECIALLY THOSE TWO ROOKIES.
[ct=3201.246] AL: OUT OF THE POCKET, LOOKS FOR
[ct=3203.716] WILLIAMS, UNDER HANDS IT, LITTLE
[ct=3203.946] SHOVEL TOSS.
[ct=3205.525] PICKS UP A FEW.
[ct=3210.157] SECOND DOWN AND 4, GAIN OF SIX.
[ct=3212.224] KIRK: NICE LITTLE TOUCH THERE.
[ct=3216.743] MOST IMPORTANT THING, THEY ARE
[ct=3218.152] ABLE TO GET OUT OF BOUNDS,
[ct=3220.106] SHOWING THAT MOBILITY.
[ct=3228.225] AVOIDED THAT RASH. -- RUSH.
[ct=3230.687] FLIPPING IT DOWN THE FIELD.
[ct=3234.174] AL: HE KNOWS THE BLITZ IS COMING
[ct=3234.791] WITH THE BLITZ IS COMING WITH
[ct=3235.102] PACE RIGHT HERE.
[ct=3240.731] ONE OF THEM COMES, FINDS HIS WAY
[ct=3241.261] , AND THAT IS ENOUGH FOR A FIRST
[ct=3250.342] THE CLOCK IS RUNNING, ONE
[ct=3251.897] TIMEOUT FOR THE RAMS REMAINS.
[ct=3256.185] KIRK: AS MUCH AS THIS MINNESOTA
[ct=3258.605] DEFENSE BLUFFS, THEY SHOW IT,
[ct=3260.185] THEY BACK OUT, GOOD JOB OF USING
[ct=3263.038] THAT HARD COUNT TO TRY TO GET
[ct=3263.962] THEM TO TIP THEIR HAND AND GET
[ct=3265.589] AN INDICATOR.
[ct=3268.360] AL: ON THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=3271.249] CAUGHT AT THE 50 YARD LINE.
[ct=3276.812] KUPP, FLAG IS THROWN WITH 53
[ct=3276.812] SECONDS.
[ct=3280.026] IF IT STANDS, THAT WOULD HAVE
[ct=3281.188] BEEN HIS THIRD CATCH TONIGHT.
[ct=3286.125] NACUA HAS BEEN THE BIG GUY.
[ct=3297.086] KIRK: JACKSON, 77, THREW
[ct=3299.008] WATCH HIM THROW HIM DOWN.
[ct=3311.050] WATCH THE FOLLOW THROUGH ON 77'S
[ct=3311.392] ARMS, THAT IS PROBABLY WHY THEY
[ct=3312.103] SAID HE WAS BLOCKING TO HIM.
[ct=3321.395] AL: SECOND AND 6, KUPP EN
[ct=3322.988] GILMORE, WHO HAS DONE THAT A LOT
[ct=3325.166] AND HIS 13 YEAR CAREER, KNOCKS
[ct=3326.450] YOU DOWN, THIRD AND 6.
[ct=3331.123] KIRK: T IS SITTING BACK, HE
[ct=3332.488] KNOWS WHETHER IT IS 17 AND 10,
[ct=3332.704] THIS TIME IT IS COOPER KUPP
[ct=3336.536] A LOT OF UNDERNEATH THROWS.
[ct=3339.171] MOST OF WHAT STAFFORD HAS THROWN
[ct=3341.808] HER GETTING OUT OF HIS HANDS --
[ct=3341.808] HAS THROWN.
[ct=3343.817] GETTING IT OUT OF HIS HANDS
[ct=3344.103] QUICKLY.
[ct=3357.837] AL: STAFFORD, AND THAT IS
[ct=3358.364] KNOCKED DOWN.
[ct=3365.648] BERNARD, CAME OVER AS A FREE
[ct=3366.015] AGENT FROM THE TEXANS.
[ct=3373.205] KIRK: THERE IS FLORES AGAIN,
[ct=3373.665] SHOWS PRESSURE AGAIN, JUST
[ct=3375.960] RUSHERS THREE, DROPS EIGHT.
[ct=3377.509] EVERYBODY IS DOWNFIELD.
[ct=3378.806] EVEN IF HE MAKES THIS CATCH AND
[ct=3380.502] THAT BALL GETS OVER BERNARD,
[ct=3382.652] THERE ARE TWO DEFENDERS RIGHT
[ct=3383.603] THERE, AND HE WOULD NOT HAVE
[ct=3384.397] EVEN GOTTEN BACK TO THE LINE OF
[ct=3387.785] AL: ETHAN EVANS.
[ct=3392.257] TRYING TO DROP IT SHORT OF THE
[ct=3392.625] GOAL LINE.
[ct=3394.466] PUT SOME BACKSPIN.
[ct=3397.613] THEY LET IT BOUNCE, AND PERFECT.
[ct=3401.310] DOWN TO THE FIVE YARD LINE.
[ct=3403.672] THE VACCINES -- THE VIKINGS HAVE
[ct=3408.212] IT FOR 35 SECONDS, ANOTHER FLAG
[ct=3409.785] DOWN AT THE 44 YARD LINE OF THE
[ct=3417.614] >> DURING THE KICK, HOLDING,
[ct=3418.757] RECEIVING TEAM.
[ct=3424.358] AL: THAT BACKS THEM UP EVEN
[ct=3424.592] FARTHER NOW.
[ct=3428.045] THEY HAVE ALL THREE TIMEOUTS BUT
[ct=3428.730] WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH 35
[ct=3428.730] SECONDS?
[ct=3432.758] KIRK: FOUR OPENING DRIVES IN
[ct=3434.691] THIS GAME, TOUCHDOWNS, GOT A
[ct=3435.003] LITTLE SLOPPY.
[ct=3438.229] EVEN WITH THE TIMEOUTS.
[ct=3441.963] THIS IS WHERE YOU FIRST GET OUT
[ct=3443.283] OF HERE IN MY OPINION.
[ct=3446.358] YOU WOULD THINK, MAKE THE
[ct=3446.358] ADJUSTMENTS.
[ct=3449.135] AL: EVERY TIME WE SAY SOMETHING
[ct=3449.551] LIKE THAT, IT HAPPENS.
[ct=3455.135] I'M THINKING LIKE 97 YARDS.
[ct=3463.145] AS YOU WOULD FIGURE, THAT IS
[ct=3463.970] JONES.
[ct=3467.929] AND THEY SHOULD LET THE CLOCK --
[ct=3469.734] KIRK: WE HAVE A GUY DOWN.
[ct=3472.066] AL: THAT WILL STOP THE CLOCK FOR
[ct=3472.066] AN INJURY.
[ct=3476.192] THAT IS THEIR BEST LINEMAN, LEFT
[ct=3476.797] TACKLE.
[ct=3482.751] KIRK: JONES, AS HE GOT TO
[ct=3485.075] FOOTBALL, HE MAY HAVE CUT
[ct=3488.071] AND THE DEFENDER MAY BE ROLLED
[ct=3493.458] UP ON DARRELL SCHALL, COMING
[ct=3493.458] FROM OUR RIGHT.
[ct=3497.949] YOU SEE THE LOWER LEFT LEG.
[ct=3504.133] AL: THREE INTERCEPTIONS, THE
[ct=3505.511] ROOKIE FREE AGENT, AND THAT IS
[ct=3510.107] WHY DARRISAW IS GOING TO NEED
[ct=3510.752] THE ATTENTION, AND HE IS STILL
[ct=3511.049] DOWN IN THE END ZONE.
[ct=3514.027] OH MAN.
[ct=3521.427] AL: DARRISAW GOT UP AND NEEDS TO
[ct=3521.747] BE ASSISTED BACK TO THE LOCKER
[ct=3522.131] ROOM.
[ct=3524.076] THE LEFT TACKLE.
[ct=3528.912] I'M TALKING ABOUT HIM THE OTHER
[ct=3530.730] DAY, WHAT A GREAT JOB HE HAS
[ct=3532.590] DONE, AND OFFENSIVE LINE,
[ct=3534.390] TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE
[ct=3537.206] BEFORE, EVERY GAME, THEY HAVE
[ct=3539.058] STARTED EVERY GAME THIS SEASON.
[ct=3542.599] NINE SNAPS COLLECTIVELY, BUT NOW
[ct=3545.345] DAVID CLOSE AND VERY -- BUT NOW
[ct=3549.358] DAVID, THAT IS A HECKUVA WAY TO
[ct=3550.318] LOSE YOU LEFT TACKLE TRYING TO
[ct=3551.025] RUN A CLOCK OUT.
[ct=3555.342] CAN KNEEL DOWN HERE WILL TAKE US
[ct=3557.347] -- THE KNEEL DOWN HERE WILL TAKE
[ct=3557.713] US TO HALFTIME.
[ct=3560.603] A SPIRITED BEGINNING TO THE
[ct=3562.064] HALF, SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT
[ct=3571.224] TOWARD THE LATTER STAGES, BUT IT
[ct=3574.993] WILL BE THE HALFTIMEACK TO START
[ct=3578.341] QUARTER, THE FIRST FOUR DRIVES
[ct=3581.395] IN THIS GAME, IT WAS A TRACK
[ct=3587.420] MEET, FOUR TOUCHDOWNS, 21, LAST
[ct=3591.307] FIVE DRIVES, ONLY THREE FIRST.
[ct=3595.320] IN THE FIRST SIX SEASONS, NO
[ct=3599.401] GAMES WITH TWO TD PASSES, HE HAS
[ct=3600.258] HAD THREE.
[ct=3604.714] STAFFORD THIS YEAR, ONLTHREE
[ct=3608.924] TOUCHDOWN PASSES, TONIGHT, PUKA
[ct=3610.258] NACUA PUKA NACUA TWO, AND HE
[ct=3612.903] GETS COOPER KUPP BACK, BACK, HE
[ct=3616.750] HAS 13 OF 18, AND HERE WE GO
[ct=3616.961] WITH THE THIRD QUARTER.
[ct=3619.738] KIRK: IT WAS GREAT TO SEE BOTH
[ct=3621.351] OF THESE QUARTERBACKS WITH
[ct=3623.096] RHYTHMS AND PLAY CALLERS, SAM
[ct=3626.371] DARNOLD AND SEAN MCVAY, WHAT HE
[ct=3627.584] CAN DO AS GOOD AS ANYBODY IN THE
[ct=3629.059] LEAGUE, AND NOW THAT HE HAS HIS
[ct=3630.622] WEAPONS BACK WITH MATTHEW
[ct=3631.828] STAFFORD, HE REALLY SAW THE
[ct=3634.531] RHYTHM OF BOTH OFFENSES AND WHAT
[ct=3635.060] THEY ARE CAPABLE OF DOING.
[ct=3636.869] I'M SURE THEY WILL MAKE
[ct=3639.125] ADJUSTMENTS AFTER THE WAY THE
[ct=3640.431] FIRST HALF ENDED UP, AND THEN
[ct=3642.351] GET BACK TO WORK.
[ct=3645.368] AL: RAMS AT THE SECOND HALF
[ct=3649.854] KICKOFF, AND WILL START AT THE
[ct=3649.854] 30.
[ct=3652.328] MOMENTS AGO, KAYLEE WAS ON THE
[ct=3652.728] FIELD WITH SEAN MCVAY.
[ct=3655.601] KAYLEE: DESCRIBE THE IMPACT
[ct=3658.229] COOPER KUPP AND PUKA NACUA HAVE
[ct=3658.858] BEEN ABLE TO HAVE COMING BACK?
[ct=3662.233] >> THEY HAVE BEEN HUGE.
[ct=3662.233] I LIKE WHAT THEY’
[ct=3663.051] I LIKE WHAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO
[ct=3663.051] DO.
[ct=3666.088] WE HAD A COUPLE OF DRIVES WHERE
[ct=3666.741] THEY STALLED BECAUSE OF
[ct=3668.057] PENALTIES ARE GREAT DEFENSE, BUT
[ct=3668.597] SECOND HALF, HERE WE GO.
[ct=3674.064] KAYLEE: THE VIKINGS SCORED
[ct=3674.416] TWO TOUCHDOWNS, AND THEN YOU
[ct=3674.684] HELD THEM.
[ct=3678.879] >> WE HAVE GOT TO KEEP GOING
[ct=3681.747] DEFENSIVELY, AND THEN WE HAVE TO
[ct=3682.736] GET A LITTLE MORE MOMENTUM TO
[ct=3685.042] FINISH THE SHOW OFFENSIVELY.
[ct=3687.880] AL: STARTING FROM THE 30 YARD
[ct=3693.000] LINE, AND, YOU KNOW, LET'S TALK
[ct=3694.164] ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE, IN
[ct=3697.627] MINNESOTA, THEY ARE IN GOOD
[ct=3698.952] SHAPE, BUT THEY ARE IN THE
[ct=3701.211] TOUGHEST DIVISION, 17-4.
[ct=3704.450] FOR THE RAMS, THE DIFFERENCE
[ct=3706.371] BETWEEN TWO AND FIVE, AT THIS
[ct=3707.017] PARTICULAR POINT IS HUGE.
[ct=3711.735] KIRK: ESPECIALLY WILLIAMS, WITH
[ct=3713.707] THE CIRCULATION OF THE
[ct=3717.218] POSSIBILITY OF GUYS POTENTIALLY
[ct=3717.524] MOVING.
[ct=3721.961] YOU CAN GET THAT MANY BY, AND,
[ct=3723.853] YOU ARE RIGHT, BOTH TEAMS NEED A
[ct=3724.189] WIN.
[ct=3728.741] AL: SECOND AND 6, AND PUKA NACUA
[ct=3732.352] IS SOMEHOW NOT ABLE TO CATCH IT,
[ct=3732.953] EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKED LIKE HE
[ct=3734.518] WAS ABLE TO WORK HIS WAY AROUND.
[ct=3741.172] WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN AMAZING
[ct=3742.657] CATCH.
[ct=3743.343] LATE FLAG, BY THE WAY.
[ct=3745.357] KIRK: WHAT AN EFFORT TO COME
[ct=3747.778] BACK TO THAT, BUT IT WOULD HAVE
[ct=3747.778] BEEN BROUGHT BACK IN, HOLDING.
[ct=3754.414] I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO DO IT
[ct=3757.059] AGAIN, HE IS FUN TO WATCH.
[ct=3757.934] NEVER KNOW WHAT HE IS CAPABLE OF
[ct=3759.835] DOING.
[ct=3761.498] VIKINGS DIALING UP PRESSURE, AND
[ct=3762.153] EVEN THOUGH THEY DID NOT GET
[ct=3764.196] HOME, THEY FORCED THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=3767.992] AND YOU HAVE A VIKINGS DEFENSE
[ct=3769.759] THAT CAN DIAL UP AS MUCH
[ct=3770.405] PRESSURE AS ANYBODY IN THE
[ct=3775.040] AL: SECOND DOWN AND 16.
[ct=3776.585] AFTER THE PENALTY FROM THE 24
[ct=3776.856] YARD LINE.
[ct=3781.668] TARON WILLIAMS.
[ct=3797.660] -- THAT ALSO INCLUDES A
[ct=3798.359] TOUCHDOWN PASS.
[ct=3801.655] KIRK: THIS IS WHERE THEY LIKE TO
[ct=3805.960] GET BACK TO IT VAN GINKEL, TRY
[ct=3806.434] TO SEE THEY CAN DIAL IT UP AND
[ct=3809.189] GET SOME TO STAFFORD, GET THAT
[ct=3809.880] BALL OUT OF HIS HANDS QUICKLY.
[ct=3811.773] THEY WILL SHOW PRESSURE LIKE
[ct=3812.391] THEY ALWAYS DO ON THIRD DOWN.
[ct=3817.644] 22 IS OFF TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=3817.644] SMITH.
[ct=3824.859] AL: EXTRA MAN COMES.
[ct=3825.116] STAFFORD THROWS.
[ct=3828.966] PUKA NACUA, ALONG THE SIDELINE,
[ct=3829.345] PULLS IT IN.
[ct=3833.613] AGAIN, GILMORE COVERING.
[ct=3836.352] I TELL YOU WHAT, FOR A GUY WHO
[ct=3839.077] HAS BEEN HURT, WHO HAS NOT
[ct=3840.654] PRACTICED, WHAT A NIGHT.
[ct=3843.575] KIRK: LET'S GIVE STAFFORD A LOT
[ct=3844.166] OF CREDIT FOR THE TIMING OF THAT
[ct=3847.434] BALL.
[ct=3847.682] HE ANTICIPATES, A TOUGH THING TO
[ct=3849.035] DO ON THIRD DOWN. GREAT FOOTWORK
[ct=3849.329] THERE.
[ct=3851.079] POSSESSES THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=3854.857] A GREAT CATCH, BUT STAFFORD
[ct=3855.689] THROWING THE BALL EARLY GAVE HIM
[ct=3856.696] THAT CHANCE TO GET THOSE FEET
[ct=3861.431] AL: SIX CATCHES, 87 YARDS.
[ct=3873.592] KIRK: AT THE END OF THE DAY,
[ct=3874.429] WHEN YOU HAVE A GOOD NIGHT
[ct=3876.067] OFFENSIVELY, IT IS OBVIOUSLY
[ct=3877.962] PLAYERS LIKE NACUA AND COOPER
[ct=3879.962] KUPP COMING BACK, BUT THOSE
[ct=3882.155] CONVERSIONS ON THIRD DOWN, THEY
[ct=3883.820] HAD A HARD TIME LAST WEEK FOR
[ct=3886.442] YOU THEY ARE TWO OF 10, AND BY
[ct=3887.855] BEING ABLE TO COME UP WITH THAT
[ct=3890.065] FIRST DOWN CONVERSION, NOW YOU
[ct=3891.465] GET BACK ACROSS, START TO RUN
[ct=3893.650] THE FOOTBALL, THEY TRIED THAT
[ct=3896.689] DOUBLE MOVE, AND IT IS NOT
[ct=3898.895] THROWING THE BALL DOWNFIELD
[ct=3899.879] MUCH, BUT YOU KNOW IT IS COMING.
[ct=3908.957] OFF THE FAKE, GOING DEEP.
[ct=3910.642] TOO DEEP.
[ct=3917.155] YOU HAVE HARRIS AND SMITH, HAS
[ct=3918.564] HAD A STELLAR CAREER, HIS 13TH
[ct=3921.382] YEAR, NUMBER ONE PICK YEARS AGO
[ct=3922.977] OUT OF NOTRE DAME, THIRD AND 6.
[ct=3925.571] KIRK: I PERSONALLY LOVE WHAT
[ct=3929.793] MCVAY DOES HERE, HE GETS THE
[ct=3930.991] BALL THROWN DOWNFIELD, SO
[ct=3935.706] HARRISON, SMITH, ALL THOSE WHO
[ct=3937.331] HAVE NOT HAD TO REALLY WORRY
[ct=3937.748] ABOUT THE BALL GOING OVER THEIR
[ct=3941.637] HEADS AT ALL TONIGHT, IF NOTHING
[ct=3943.138] ELSE, IT REMINDS THEM ABOUT
[ct=3946.576] STAFFORD, AND THAT CAN OPEN UP
[ct=3947.172] OPPORTUNITIES.
[ct=3953.302] AL: KUPP MOVING.
[ct=3956.197] THE THROW, AND IT WILL BE PICKED
[ct=3957.526] UP ALONG THE SIDELINE.
[ct=3961.272] MURPHY WITH THE INTERCEPTION.
[ct=3965.411] OVERTHROWN, AND MURPHY IS ABLE
[ct=3967.160] TO CORRAL IT AND STAY IN BOUNDS
[ct=3967.445] WITH IT.
[ct=3972.198] THREE MINUTES IN TO THE THIRD.
[ct=3972.526] MINNESOTA WITH THE BALL.
[ct=3975.721] THE GAME IS LOCKED AT 14-14.
[ct=3981.518] MEANWHILE, MURPHY WITH THE PICK,
[ct=3982.885] 12 INTERCEPTIONS NOW FOR THE
[ct=3986.851] VIKINGS, TOP AND THE LEAGUE,
[ct=3988.277] SECOND FOR MURPHY THIS YEAR.
[ct=3992.805] AND A RUN BY JONES.
[ct=3996.349] LINUS, THEIR BIG LEFT
[ct=3997.615] GO TO KAYLEE.
[ct=4001.256] KAYLEE: CHRISTIAN DARRISAW WILL
[ct=4002.707] NOT RETURN TO THE GAME, AND HE
[ct=4005.281] HAS NOT EVEN RETURN TO THE
[ct=4005.603] VIKINGS SIDELINE.
[ct=4007.201] HE TOOK THAT SHOT TO THE OUTSIDE
[ct=4009.364] OF HIS LEFT KNEE, AND TRAINERS
[ct=4010.509] ARE FOCUSING ON STABILITY OF THE
[ct=4012.801] KNEE WHEN THEY EVALUATED HIM AND
[ct=4014.483] YOU SAW HIM PUT LITTLE
[ct=4017.604] WEIGHTS, SO HE IS OUT.
[ct=4024.099] IN THE LEAGUE, DAVID
[ct=4026.997] QUESSENBERRY TAKES HIS SPOT.
[ct=4031.635] AND TRIPPED UP AT THE 43 YARD
[ct=4037.834] KIRK: YOU GOT THE 12 PERSON
[ct=4039.517] NOWLAND WITH TWO TIGHT ENDS.
[ct=4042.150] THE PLAY ACTION, WATCH HOW THEY
[ct=4042.373] GET OUT.
[ct=4045.386] THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE
[ct=4047.648] POTENTIAL SHOTS DOWNFIELD.
[ct=4048.908] IT IS WITH THE VIKINGS LIKE TO
[ct=4049.709] DO WITH THE PLAY-ACTION, TAKE
[ct=4050.018] SHOTS.
[ct=4052.348] WITH A COMPLEMENT AND WHAT YOU
[ct=4054.488] HAVE TO RESPECT IS NOT JUST THE
[ct=4054.853] RUNNING GAME.
[ct=4070.228] AL: AGAIN, JONES, SECOND AND 8.
[ct=4073.194] KIRK: NOBODY IS EVER GOING TO BE
[ct=4075.588] AARON DONALD, WE KNOW THAT, BUT
[ct=4080.948] KOBIE TURNER, WHO HAD A GREAT
[ct=4082.324] ROOKIE YEAR OUT OF WAKE FOREST,
[ct=4082.866] HE HAS MOVED OUT TO THAT TACKLE
[ct=4090.429] SPOT AND HE HAS SOME TWITCH, HE
[ct=4091.766] HAS SOME QUICKNESS.
[ct=4096.258] SO THAT TIME, HE MADE A GREAT
[ct=4099.659] PLAY, AND HE NEEDED TO GET THE
[ct=4105.729] BACKFIELD.
[ct=4108.435] AL: TRYING TO FIGHT FOR IT.
[ct=4112.685] LET'S SEE IF HE GOT IT OR NOT,
[ct=4115.624] THAT IS JORDAN.
[ct=4117.824] KIRK: HOW ABOUT THAT FOR A FIRST
[ct=4118.110] DOWN?
[ct=4128.494] ADDISON, AGAIN AND ENDED UP
[ct=4130.437] TRANSFERRING TO USC, KEEP GOING,
[ct=4132.562] KEEP GOING, GOT HIM.
[ct=4136.757] THIS IS AN EFFORT TEAM.
[ct=4138.833] BOTH SIDES OF THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=4140.748] AL: YOU CANNOT GET A BETTER
[ct=4140.953] VIEW.
[ct=4142.401] KIRK: THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
[ct=4147.785] AL: FROM THE 47.
[ct=4159.840] JEFFERSON, WHO IS BLAZING HOT
[ct=4161.145] THAT FIRST HALF, HE HAS ALREADY
[ct=4165.150] CAUGHT 60 OF 74, BUT HE HAS BEEN
[ct=4166.430] QUIET THE LAST QUARTER PLUS.
[ct=4169.131] KIRK: YOU ARE RIGHT, THE WAY
[ct=4171.443] THIS GAME STARTED, DETERMINED TO
[ct=4172.132] GET HIM GOING EARLY.
[ct=4174.671] JUST AS YOU SAY THAT, YOU KNOW
[ct=4176.431] IT IS A MATTER OF TIME, LIKE
[ct=4177.100] LAST AGAINST THE LIONS.
[ct=4180.805] THEY MADE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO
[ct=4182.215] GET HIM MORE INVOLVED, AND THEY
[ct=4182.541] DID.
[ct=4183.239] IT HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THE COME
[ct=4187.080] AL: ONLY SIX YARDS SINCE, SECOND
[ct=4188.044] AND EIGHT.
[ct=4200.673] DONALD AVOIDS -- DARNOLD AVOIDS
[ct=4200.673] THE SACK.
[ct=4202.545] YOU COULD HAVE PREDICTED THAT.
[ct=4206.136] KIRK: THE LEFT GUARD MAKES A
[ct=4206.880] CRITICAL BLOCK.
[ct=4208.610] WATCH THIS.
[ct=4209.283] I THOUGHT THE PRESSURE MIGHT GET
[ct=4209.702] TO HIM.
[ct=4211.741] HE GOES INSIDE, OUTSIDE, AND
[ct=4216.922] THEN HE JUST MOVES HIS HAND ON
[ct=4218.537] SAM DARNOLD, BUT THIS IS WHERE
[ct=4219.448] JEFFERSON HAD MOST OF HIS
[ct=4220.204] OPPORTUNITIES, OVER THE MIDDLE
[ct=4222.153] OF THAT DEFENSE, BEHIND THE
[ct=4223.719] LINEBACKERS, GETTING LOST A
[ct=4226.026] LITTLE BIT IN COVERAGE.
[ct=4239.564] AL: DONALD -- DARNOLD, IN THE
[ct=4241.320] CORNER, HE IS JUGGLING, AND THEY
[ct=4242.044] ARE GOING TO SAY HE DID CATCH
[ct=4248.005] VIKINGS ARE GOING TO RACE OFF
[ct=4248.977] THE LINE BEFORE THE RAMS CAN GET
[ct=4251.387] SET, BEFORE THEY CAN CHALLENGE
[ct=4251.387] THIS.
[ct=4252.816] KIRK: LET'S SEE.
[ct=4256.478] AL: IS IT WORTH A CHALLENGE?
[ct=4257.176] WILL MCVAY THROW THE FLAG?
[ct=4258.270] TOO LATE.
[ct=4261.763] TAKEN DOWN.
[ct=4262.964] JONES WAS TAKEN DOWN.
[ct=4265.332] KIRK: I THINK HE ENDED UP
[ct=4265.993] CATCHING IT AT THE END.
[ct=4269.198] HOW ABOUT THE NONCHALANCE TO GET
[ct=4270.420] IT STARTED?
[ct=4271.412] NO PROBLEM.
[ct=4272.967] NOW HE HAS GOT IT.
[ct=4278.405] GIVING US THE CATCH SIGN.
[ct=4278.881] HE BELIEVES IT IS A CATCH.
[ct=4281.160] AL: 27 YARDS.
[ct=4284.910] TRIPLE DIGITS RIGHT NOW IT 115.
[ct=4287.298] KIRK: LET'S NOT TAKE THOSE
[ct=4287.847] CATCHES FOR GRANTED.
[ct=4289.991] WE ARE USED TO HIM DOING THAT.
[ct=4292.711] AL: THAT WAS SPECTACULAR.
[ct=4295.365] KIRK: RIGHT WHEN THEY SAID WHERE
[ct=4295.365] IS OUR
[ct=4296.634] CATCHES.
[ct=4299.337] AL: THEY WOKE HIM UP.
[ct=4300.621] SECOND AND GOAL.
[ct=4308.574] 40 YARD LINE, AARON JONES, SEVEN
[ct=4308.574] AND ITS REMAINING IN THE THIRD.
[ct=4313.904] KIRK: HE JUST HAS SO MANY
[ct=4313.904] DIFFERENT THINGS.
[ct=4316.606] WHEN I WATCH AND PLAY WITH JOE
[ct=4320.611] BURROW, I USED TO THINK, THIS
[ct=4320.611] GUY LOOKS LIKE HE PLAYED A LOT
[ct=4323.185] OF FOOTBALL IN HIS DAYS AS A
[ct=4325.892] KID, OLDER BROTHERS WHO PLAYED
[ct=4328.483] FOOTBALL, THEY PLAYED AT LSU,
[ct=4332.500] AND HE HAS SUCH NATURAL SAVVY.
[ct=4333.820] BEYOND JUST HE IS A GOOD
[ct=4333.820] RECEIVER, HE IS FAST.
[ct=4339.188] AL: MURPHY ON THE BENCH,
[ct=4340.531] INTERCEPTION, SETTING UP THE
[ct=4348.499] DARNOLD IN THE POCKET, FIRES.
[ct=4353.809] JEFFERSON GOT CRACKING THAT TIME
[ct=4355.063] BY WALLACE, AND THEY WILL SEND
[ct=4356.518] IT TO FIELD GOAL, TWO.
[ct=4357.811] KIRK: EVEN THOUGH THEY MOVED HIM
[ct=4360.453] TO THE LEFT TO THE RIGHT, HE
[ct=4361.702] WILL STILL FIND A WAY TO DOUBLE
[ct=4364.452] IT, TAKEN INSIDE, OUTSIDE, EVEN
[ct=4366.980] THAT DOUBLE MOVE, AND STARTING
[ct=4366.980] TO CREEP IN THERE WITH DARRISAW
[ct=4371.071] OUT AND DAVID QUESSENBERRY IN, I
[ct=4373.730] THINK HE FELT THE PRESSURE THAT
[ct=4373.730] TIME FROM THE LEFT SIDE WITH
[ct=4375.077] THAT BACKUP TACKLE.
[ct=4380.285] AL: REICHERT HAS NOT MISSED A
[ct=4381.646] KICK ALL SEASON.
[ct=4384.408] CHIP SHOT HERE.
[ct=4388.410] 23.
[ct=4389.702] SO THE VIKINGS HAVE THE LEAD
[ct=4396.306] THAT HAPPENED TWICE THE FIRST
[ct=4397.563] HALF.
[ct=4397.563] 17-14.
[ct=4398.973] WELL, T
[ct=4400.307] DOWNTOWN.
[ct=4405.650] LOS ANGELES, JEFFERSON MADE
[ct=4406.876] THOSE TWO CATCHES, INCLUDING
[ct=4408.222] THAT SPECTACULAR ONE, BUT COULD
[ct=4409.574] NOT PAID OFF IN THE END ZONE.
[ct=4410.923] FRUSTRATION ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=4413.678] THE VIKINGS HAVE THE LEAD.
[ct=4417.543] REICHERT TO KICK OFF.
[ct=4424.237] AND DEEP IN THE END ZONE, WE GO
[ct=4424.237] TO KAYLEE ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=4428.228] KAYLEE: IT IS TIME FOR TONIGHT'S
[ct=4429.396] JOURNEY, PRESENTED BY HON DAY.
[ct=4432.153] MATTHEW STAFFORD, THE NUMBER ONE
[ct=4433.502] OVERALL PICK IN THE 2009 DRAFT
[ct=4434.842] IS THE ONLY QUARTERBACK LEFT
[ct=4437.466] STANDING WEEKS LATER.
[ct=4440.030] MARK SANCHEZ MADE IT THE NEXT
[ct=4440.030] LONGEST AND HE HAD NOT
[ct=4441.475] FOR SIX YEARS.
[ct=4442.807] STAFFORD'S LONGEVITY HAS
[ct=4444.133] SURPASSED EVERY PLAYER IN THE
[ct=4446.781] DRAFT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
[ct=4449.440] THOMAS MORSTEAD, PROBABLY WITH A
[ct=4449.440] LITTLE LESS WEAR-AND-TEAR.
[ct=4464.305] STAFFORD NOW, FROM THE 22, 138,
[ct=4466.675] AND DOWN THE MIDDLE IS WILLIAMS.
[ct=4469.240] KIRK: HE GOT OFF TO A QUICK
[ct=4469.240] START.
[ct=4472.681] WE TALKED ALL DAY ABOUT HIM.
[ct=4479.639] PUKA NACUA IS BACK, AND THE
[ct=4481.072] BIGGEST THING WE SAW WAS THE
[ct=4481.338] BALL GETTING OUT OF HIS HANDS.
[ct=4483.457] IT IS TOUGH TO TACKLE THE
[ct=4485.200] VIKINGS DEFENSE AND TO BE ABLE
[ct=4486.817] TO HIT TO THAT LAST DRIVE.
[ct=4489.334] THEY GOT A GOOD PUSH ON THE LEFT
[ct=4491.903] SIDE, AND THEY DOUBLED, TRYING
[ct=4494.896] TO GET IT OVER THE TOP, AND JUST
[ct=4495.280] MISSED.
[ct=4502.857] AL: SECOND AND 8.
[ct=4508.170] THROWS, COCKED, OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=4512.325] AND THAT IS A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4515.381] KIRK: LET'S GIVE THIS OFFENSIVE
[ct=4519.320] LINE CREDIT, ROOKIE AT CENTER,
[ct=4519.809] LEFT GUARD, AND STAFFORD IS ONE
[ct=4523.020] OF THE FIRST GUYS, IF YOU TALK
[ct=4525.486] ABOUT THE ARM ANGLES, BRETT
[ct=4528.049] FAVRE, AARON ROGERS, AND THEN HE
[ct=4529.370] SEES HIM SNEAK THAT IN, LIKE A
[ct=4531.800] SHORTSTOP, TALKING ABOUT HIS
[ct=4532.080] BASEBALL DAYS.
[ct=4534.825] JUST FLIPS IT RIGHT THERE.
[ct=4539.213] AND WITH ALL THAT TIME,
[ct=4539.958] EVENTUALLY, THEY WOULD FIND
[ct=4540.316] SOMEONE OVER.
[ct=4543.758] AL: UP IN MOTION.
[ct=4548.503] AND WILLIAMS DROPS IT.
[ct=4554.631] HAD NOT GOTTEN MUCH IN ALL
[ct=4554.835] LIKELIHOOD.
[ct=4556.371] SECOND DOWN AND 10.
[ct=4559.469] KIRK: ONE OF THE SMARTEST GUYS,
[ct=4561.716] PHILLIPS, THE NOSE GUARD, WAS
[ct=4563.294] OUT THERE, SEVENTH YEAR, OUT OF
[ct=4565.906] IT IS ALMOST BETTER OFF YOU
[ct=4566.399] DROPPED HIM.
[ct=4571.310] THAT BALL WAS DEFINITELY THROWN
[ct=4571.553] FORWARD BY STAFFORD.
[ct=4578.920] YOU ASKED EARLIER ABOUT JUSTIN
[ct=4582.189] JEFFERSON, AND WHERE IS SEE?
[ct=4582.410] WHERE IS COOPER KUPP?
[ct=4586.594] AL: HE HAS GOT THREE TONIGHT, 15
[ct=4594.576] AND THAT IS CAUGHT AT THE 41.
[ct=4598.755] THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE
[ct=4600.402] TARGETED HIM TONIGHT, AND
[ct=4602.677] PULLS THAT BABY IN.
[ct=4606.835] KIRK: YOU SAW TYLER JOHNSON, HE
[ct=4608.390] GOES RIGHT INTO THE FLAT, PULLS
[ct=4611.070] THAT FLAT DEFENDER WITH HIM,
[ct=4614.371] GRIFFITH, AND A SIMPLE HIGH-LOW
[ct=4619.066] READ FOR AST
[ct=4620.335] READ FOR AS ACCURATE A
[ct=4620.596] QUARTERBACK AS YOU WILL SEE WAS
[ct=4623.523] STAFFORD WILL MAKE THAT THROUGH
[ct=4623.851] EVERY TIME.
[ct=4625.869] AL: WITH THE TWO BIG GUNS
[ct=4629.383] MISSING, UNTIL TONIGHT, HE WAS
[ct=4630.614] THE LEADING RECEIVER.
[ct=4639.083] PAUL PLAY ACTION, GOING DEEP, ON
[ct=4641.255] THE SIDELINE, AND IT IS
[ct=4645.352] BROKEN OUT AT THE VERY END BY
[ct=4645.352] MURPHY.
[ct=4649.148] GOT OUT IN FRONT, BUT MURPHY IS
[ct=4652.197] ABLE TO MAKE UP THE GROUND AND
[ct=4653.197] KNOCK IT DOWN.
[ct=4653.907] INCOMPLETE, SECOND AND 10.
[ct=4657.483] KIRK: YOU MOVE HIM, THE WAY
[ct=4658.442] MCVAY USUALLY DOES, BUT IT
[ct=4659.909] CREATES A MATCHUP FOR AN
[ct=4660.198] UNDERSIZED ATHLETE.
[ct=4664.097] HE THINKS HE HAS HELPED BUT THAT
[ct=4666.677] BALL IS THROWN, HE SAW IT A
[ct=4667.142] LITTLE BIT LATE, AND HE GAVE
[ct=4670.361] MURPHY ENOUGH TIME TO CATCH UP
[ct=4670.722] AND GET THE RIGHT HAND.
[ct=4674.075] IF HE HAD THROWN IT EARLIER, WE
[ct=4675.309] WOULD HAVE SEEN IT EARLIER, BUT
[ct=4675.909] THAT IS A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=4680.349] AL: TWO BIG PLAYS NOW FOR
[ct=4683.852] MURPHY, THE INTERCEPTION, AND
[ct=4686.538] THAT ONE, THE PLAY CLOCK IS DOWN
[ct=4687.024] TO ZERO.
[ct=4690.653] KIRK: EVERYONE MOVED AGAIN.
[ct=4692.137] STAFFORD DID NOT GET UP.
[ct=4694.048] >> FALSE START.
[ct=4697.837] 79.
[ct=4700.651] AL: SECOND PENALTY.
[ct=4707.115] KIRK: MISSED OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=4708.467] NOW YOU GET A PENALTY.
[ct=4713.865] AL: SECOND DOWN AND 15, COOPER
[ct=4717.949] KUPP, EXPECTED TO PLAY, NACUA
[ct=4721.136] NOT EXPECTED TO PLAY, 87 YARDS.
[ct=4725.961] LIMITED TO 15.
[ct=4731.299] AND SIDELINE, ON THE LEFT, WIDE
[ct=4731.516] OPEN.
[ct=4733.673] THERE IS NACUA.
[ct=4734.506] HE TAKES IT TO THE 26 YARD LINE.
[ct=4739.629] AND HE MAKES THAT TACKLE.
[ct=4742.633] SEVEN CATCHES, 106 YARDS.
[ct=4745.531] KIRK: WATCH HIM LOOK LEFT AND
[ct=4749.017] THEN COME BACK, KNOWING EXACTLY
[ct=4749.725] WHERE HE WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH
[ct=4749.999] THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=4752.178] HIS EYES RIGHT NOW ARE OVER HERE
[ct=4752.942] TO JUST OPEN UP THE MIDDLE OF
[ct=4756.493] THE FIELD, COMES BACK, STEPS
[ct=4760.154] INTO IT, AND THROWS AN
[ct=4764.643] ABSOLUTE BLAZER TO NACUA TO COME
[ct=4765.272] UP WITH A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4775.387] AL: ONE OR TWO BY WILLIAMS,
[ct=4777.482] TACKLE, SECOND DOWN.
[ct=4781.485] KIRK: ALL THE TALK YESTERDAY,
[ct=4783.543] TODAY, ABOUT THE POTENTIAL,
[ct=4785.744] COULD A MATTHEW STAFFORD EVER
[ct=4785.744] GET MOVED?
[ct=4789.943] A LOT OF TIME IT COMES UP WITH
[ct=4791.255] THE SALARY AND THE CAP HIT, WHAT
[ct=4791.595] IT MIGHT BE.
[ct=4793.282] HE IS 36 YEARS OLD.
[ct=4797.792] HE IS PROBABLY IN AS GOOD OF
[ct=4798.497] SHAPE AS HE HAS BEEN HIS WHOLE
[ct=4801.532] LIFE, STILL MAKES THROWS LIKE
[ct=4802.059] I DON’
[ct=4802.770] I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT IS A
[ct=4803.106] CONVERSATION.
[ct=4807.535] AL: WAS IN DETROIT BEFORE HE
[ct=4807.535] CAME HERE.
[ct=4813.340] THROWS THIS ONE TO THE CORNER.
[ct=4817.275] REACHING FOR IT, AND A FLAG IS
[ct=4817.489] THROWN ON THE END
[ct=4818.823] ROBINSON COMES DOWN WITH IT FOR
[ct=4819.889] THE MOMENT.
[ct=4821.479] DEMARCUS ROBINSON.
[ct=4825.436] AND THE RAMS ALREADY
[ct=4826.848] CELEBRATING.
[ct=4831.415] 25 YARDS, AND THE FLAG WILL BE
[ct=4831.679] AGAINST MINNESOTA.
[ct=4841.437] KIRK: WE TALK SO MUCH ABOUT
[ct=4843.452] NACUA AND COOPER KUPP.
[ct=4847.768] HERE IS DEMARCUS ROBINSON, WHO
[ct=4848.173] GIVES ONE-ON-ONE.
[ct=4850.733] HE IS ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THAT
[ct=4850.733] HOLD.
[ct=4853.123] NO SAFETY SUPPORT OVER THE TOP.
[ct=4858.534] YOU ARE ON AN ISLAND, AND WITH
[ct=4861.199] THIS DEFENSE, AND WHEN RYAN
[ct=4861.199] FLOREZ PLAYS, YOU HAVE GOT TO BE
[ct=4861.708] ABLE TO HOLD UP.
[ct=4863.975] GOOD JOB.
[ct=4865.044] THEY ARE ABLE TO TAKE THE LEAD
[ct=4865.386] HERE IN THE THIRD.
[ct=4870.430] AL: ROBINSON'S FIRST CATCH OF
[ct=4880.318] MOVES IT THROUGH, 2.5, TO THE
[ct=4880.863] THIRD, AND THE RAMS HAVE THE
[ct=4882.478] LEAD FOR THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT.
[ct=4887.005] UP TO FOUR.
[ct=4893.961] KIRK: WHAT A CALL HERE BY SEAN
[ct=4896.933] MCVAY TO MOTION TYLER JOHNSON
[ct=4897.235] OVER HIM.
[ct=4900.717] WHEN HE MOVES THEM, IS GOING TO
[ct=4902.209] MOVE WITH THEM, WHICH TELLS
[ct=4905.142] MATTHEW STAFFORD, I HAVE ONE OUT
[ct=4908.209] HERE TODAY, -- OUT HERE, AND I'M
[ct=4908.423] GOING TO RUN.
[ct=4909.349] HE IS ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THE
[ct=4911.973] THAT IS THE THIRD QUARTER WITH
[ct=4914.059] GRIFFIN, AND THEY KNEW THE
[ct=4914.562] MATCHUP THEY HAD.
[ct=4917.184] IT IS ALMOST LIKE I TOLD YOU
[ct=4917.872] THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
[ct=4921.097] I TOLD YOU WE GET THAT ONE ON
[ct=4922.074] ONE MATCH UP, AND HE DID IT.
[ct=4923.970] AL: THE CELEBRATION ON THE
[ct=4924.292] SIDELINES.
[ct=4927.829] THIS TIME, EVERYBODY IS TALKING
[ct=4929.718] ABOUT THE PASSING OF FERNANDO
[ct=4934.639] VALENZUELA, 63 YEARS OLD, AND
[ct=4936.600] FERNANDO MANIA OVERTOOK THE TOWN
[ct=4940.093] BACK IN THE EARLY 1980'S,
[ct=4941.310] PITCHED IN THE WORLD SERIES,
[ct=4944.666] GAME THREE, 1981,
[ct=4944.943] YANKEES-DODGERS.
[ct=4948.923] HE HAD THROWN 147 PITCHES THAT
[ct=4951.513] GAME, THIS IS GRANDFATHERS
[ct=4951.721] BASEBALL.
[ct=4952.454] THINK ABOUT THAT.
[ct=4955.063] THE DODGERS AN ACTION AGAINST
[ct=4955.724] THE YANKEES TOMORROW.
[ct=4958.103] WALKED SEVEN GUYS, GAVE UP NINE
[ct=4960.338] HITS AND PITCHED A COMPLETE
[ct=4962.947] KIRK: AMAZING.
[ct=4967.390] AL: TO THE 35 YARD LINE,
[ct=4968.503] MEANT SO MUCH TO THE TOWN.
[ct=4971.479] KIRK: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHEN
[ct=4972.775] YOU THINK OF FERNANDO?
[ct=4978.368] AL: JUST HIS DELIVERY, HE LOOKED
[ct=4981.142] AT THE SKY, ANOTHER WINDUP,
[ct=4982.658] THROW A SOMBRERO IN THE AIR, I
[ct=4985.557] MEAN, HE WAS VERY SPECIAL, VERY
[ct=4986.203] HUMBLE.
[ct=4992.099] WAS ON SPANISH-LANGUAGE RADIO
[ct=4993.865] WITH THE DODGERS FOR MANY YEARS,
[ct=4995.519] A WONDERFUL, HUMBLE MAN.
[ct=4997.688] HE TURNED THIS TOWN UPSIDE DOWN
[ct=4998.176] WHEN HE WAS PITCHING.
[ct=4999.332] KIRK: NO DOUBT.
[ct=5002.667] AL: SECOND AND 5, 35 YARD LINE.
[ct=5011.336] MOVES UP, THROWS, COCKED AT THE
[ct=5011.560] 45.
[ct=5014.430] AND FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5019.689] KIRK: WE HAVE TO SEE DARNOLD
[ct=5022.816] AGAIN, WHO HAS BEEN QUESTIONED
[ct=5024.410] THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER IF HE
[ct=5026.834] COULD BE THE GUY, BUT HE HAS THE
[ct=5027.388] ATHLETIC ABILITY TO GET OUT OF
[ct=5030.403] LAST WEEK ESPECIALLY, USING HIS
[ct=5033.189] LEGS, BUT JUST BACK THERE,
[ct=5033.546] TAKING OFF WHEN HE FEELS
[ct=5037.245] HE SUDDENLY MOVES UP, CLIMBS THE
[ct=5038.506] POCKET, CHECKS DOWN.
[ct=5041.572] THAT IS QUARTERBACKING IN THIS
[ct=5042.838] GREAT JOB.
[ct=5050.469] AL: JONES, ON THE TOSS.
[ct=5057.131] WE GO TO THE FINAL MINUTE.
[ct=5059.963] UNDER ONE MINUTE TO PLAY IN T
[ct=5060.285] THIRD.
[ct=5063.067] KIRK: BOBBY BROWN WORKING DOWN
[ct=5063.803] THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=5068.107] 328 POUNDS, DOES A GOOD JOB OF
[ct=5070.488] ROTATING, TRYING TO STAY FRESH
[ct=5070.728] UPFRONT.
[ct=5076.273] I'M SURPRISED CHRIS TOLD ME THE
[ct=5078.926] UNSUNG HERO OF THIS DEFENSE IS
[ct=5081.155] 97 POINT BECAUSE THEY CAN DO SO
[ct=5081.505] MANY DIFFERENT THINGS WITH IT.
[ct=5087.529] AL: THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR,
[ct=5090.980] SON OF DAVID, THAT IS CAUGHT,
[ct=5093.155] ACROSS THE 50.
[ct=5097.629] NAILOR MAKES BACKGROUND.
[ct=5100.525] AND DARNOLD WILL TRY TO TAKE
[ct=5101.955] INTO THE LINE BEFORE THE END OF
[ct=5102.279] THE QUARTER.
[ct=5102.663] THIRD DOWN AND 3.
[ct=5118.333] TRYING TO DRAW THEM OFFSIDE,
[ct=5118.715] WHICH YOU CANNOT.
[ct=5121.334] TRIPLE DIGITS ON THE CLOCK, AND
[ct=5128.953] UPAL: FOURTH QUARTER, THE
[ct=5130.374] STANDINGS, EC THE VIKINGS FIVE
[ct=5132.204] AND ONE, THAT DIVISION THE
[ct=5135.409] TOUGHEST RIGHT NOW.
[ct=5139.140] THE RAMS TRYING TO GET TO 3-4,
[ct=5142.011] WOULD BE ONE GAME BACK OF THE
[ct=5144.423] SEAHAWKS, WHO THEY PLAY THIS
[ct=5144.423] SUNDAY.
[ct=5145.971] THE SEAHAWKS HOSTING BUFFALO
[ct=5146.252] THIS WEEK.
[ct=5151.414] DARNOLD STEPS UP IN THE POCKET.
[ct=5154.389] THROWS, AND IT IS ALONG THE
[ct=5155.318] SIDELINE.
[ct=5157.411] IT IS CAUGHT BY AARON JONES.
[ct=5160.547] KIRK: THIS IS A RED ALERT, RED
[ct=5163.926] ALERT, YOU HAVE A MATCHUP.
[ct=5164.718] THIS GUY IS 280 POUNDS.
[ct=5169.252] THERE IS NO WAY HE COULD MATCHUP
[ct=5171.735] WITH AARON JONES, AND A BIG
[ct=5173.297] THIRD DOWN, HE SAW THAT MATCHUP,
[ct=5175.045] HIS EYES LIT UP AND HE KNEW
[ct=5175.749] EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED TO DO.
[ct=5178.305] THAT IS A GOOD JOB GETTING HIS
[ct=5178.702] FEET DOWN.
[ct=5182.857] THIS GUY HAS WIDE RECEIVER FOOT
[ct=5184.592] SAT AS FAR AS RUNNING ROUNDS,
[ct=5186.046] AND HE GOT MATCHED UP AGAINST
[ct=5189.281] THE BIG I, WHO WE TALKED ABOUT
[ct=5189.574] BEING AN UNSUNG HERO.
[ct=5193.405] AL: ONE OF AARON ROGERS FAVORITE
[ct=5193.405] PLAYERS.
[ct=5199.625] AND A FLAG BEFORE THE SACK.
[ct=5204.268] >> TIMEOUT.
[ct=5206.061] MINNESOTA.
[ct=5207.630] THEIR FIRST OF THE HALF.
[ct=5214.663] 30 SECOND TIMEOUT.
[ct=5217.959] AL: PART OF THAT UNBELIEVABLE
[ct=5219.814] SEAN MCVAY COACHING, THE THIRD
[ct=5223.358] YOUNGEST COACH IN THE LEAGUE,
[ct=5223.552] WHICH MCVEIGH'S, ONLY MIKE
[ct=5227.466] MACDONALD IN SEATTLE, AND THIS
[ct=5231.718] GUY, FOUR GUYS WHO ARE FORMER
[ct=5235.670] ASSISTANTS, BRANDON STALEY IS
[ct=5236.569] ANOTHER GUY, WHO WAS WITH THE
[ct=5241.071] CHARGERS, NO UP IN SAN FRANCISCO
[ct=5242.452] , AND IT IS FRANKLY ASTONISHING.
[ct=5246.252] KIRK: IT REALLY IS, AND THE
[ct=5249.137] ENERGY HE PROVIDES, THEY LEARN
[ct=5249.480] FROM HIM, THEY HAVE WATCHED HIM.
[ct=5254.821] THAT SHOWS THE ENERGY OF THE
[ct=5255.552] MODERN PLAYER CAN GO A LONG WAY.
[ct=5262.736] AND WITH THE QUARTERBACK COACH,
[ct=5262.940] WITH SAM DARNOLD, HE IS PART OF
[ct=5263.490] THAT SAME STUFF.
[ct=5265.832] AL: ON THE GROUND.
[ct=5268.335] YOU SAW THAT GRAPHIC ABOUT EVERY
[ct=5272.966] YEAR OVER THE LAST FIVE, OFFENSE
[ct=5274.103] AND DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, HE
[ct=5275.886] MADE HIS OWN BED WITH THAT, AND
[ct=5276.544] HE IS SO GOOD TRAINING THESE

[ct=5280.621] OWN SUCCESS.
[ct=5284.970] SECOND AND 6.
[ct=5286.249] INSIGHT HANDOFF.
[ct=5289.331] THIRD DOWN, NOW AT THE 17 YARD
[ct=5294.181] JONES CARRYING HERE.
[ct=5297.231] HE HAS NOW CARRIED 18 TIMES TO
[ct=5298.288] THE 56 YARDS.
[ct=5303.019] KIRK: GREAT VISION, HE FINDS THE
[ct=5303.294] HOLE.
[ct=5306.256] GETS AS MUCH AS HE CAN OUT OF
[ct=5310.137] RAMS DEFENSE THIS YEAR HAS
[ct=5313.513] ALLOWED 120 YARDS OR MORE ON THE

[ct=5321.526] AL: THIRD AND 4.
[ct=5328.341] DARNOLD STEPPING UP.
[ct=5333.880] COULD NOT HANDLE IT.
[ct=5339.425] KIRK: THAT PUTS A REALLY TOUGH
[ct=5339.425] SPOT.
[ct=5342.071] YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE OF DARNOLD
[ct=5346.188] CLIMBING THE LADDR.
[ct=5348.722] WATCH HOW HE PULLS THE
[ct=5349.300] LINEBACKERS.
[ct=5355.755] ISRAEL HERE PULLING AWAY -- HERE
[ct=5357.087] HE IS RIGHT HERE PULLING AWAY.
[ct=5359.724] RIGHT ON THE MONEY.
[ct=5365.911] AL: 35 YARD FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT.
[ct=5373.257] UP AND GOOD.
[ct=5374.748] THAT WILL MAKE IT TIME FOR THE
[ct=5376.577] REPORT.
[ct=5380.264] WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT WILLIAMS
[ct=5380.491] BEING RELIABLE.
[ct=5387.150] THEY HAVE OPEN THINGS UP.
[ct=5390.140] HE GETS A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=5393.959] THAT HAS OPENED UP MATTHEW
[ct=5398.344] IT LOOKS LIKE THE OLD OFFENSE
[ct=5399.003] FROM THE RAMS WERE USED TO
[ct=5399.003] SEEING.
[ct=5402.456] WILLIAMS HAVING A GREAT NIGHT
[ct=5402.947] TONIGHT AS WELL.

[ct=5450.113] A FLAG.
[ct=5454.676] REFEREE: FIVE YARD PENALTY.
[ct=5461.052] AL: TURNER, THE ROOKIE, THE
[ct=5463.422] NUMBER ONE PICK OUT OF ALABAMA,
[ct=5465.529] WAS TO 12TH MAN IF YOU
[ct=5466.999] SEATTLE BUT NOT SO GREAT HERE
[ct=5469.154] KIRK: THERE THEY ARE.
[ct=5473.433] DALLAS TURNER, THE FIRST ROUNDER
[ct=5473.916] YOU MENTIONED.
[ct=5479.826] IT HAS BEEN TOUGH FOR HIM TO GET
[ct=5480.218] ON THE FIELD THIS YEAR.
[ct=5483.099] THIS KID IS GOING TO BE A
[ct=5483.387] SPECIAL PLAYER.
[ct=5486.760] RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE THREE GUYS
[ct=5487.646] AND ALL THREE OF THEM HAVE FIVE
[ct=5487.998] SACKS.
[ct=5491.009] AL: FIRST AND 5.
[ct=5493.870] STAFFORD DUMPS IT OFF.
[ct=5500.126] TO THE 44 YARD LINE GOES THE
[ct=5500.354] MICHIGAN ROOKIE.
[ct=5503.257] KIRK: IT IS SO FUN TO WATCH A
[ct=5505.804] QUARTERBACK WHO IS COMFORTABLE.
[ct=5511.670] HE TURNS HIS BACK ON PLAY ACTION
[ct=5513.953] AND CALMLY ALREADY KNOWS HE IS
[ct=5514.851] GOING TO CHECK THIS DOWN.
[ct=5518.128] LET THAT DEFENSE KEEP DROPPING
[ct=5520.628] HE KNOWS HE WANTS TO CHECK THIS
[ct=5521.050] BALL DOWN.
[ct=5523.405] ABLE TO PICK UP FIRST DOWN
[ct=5523.755] YARDAGE.
[ct=5533.107] AL: ROLLING LEFT, FIRING,

[ct=5546.781] KIRK: WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE
[ct=5547.116] EDGE PRESSURE.
[ct=5550.558] YOU CANNOT LOSE CONTAIN HERE.
[ct=5560.882] THESE QUICK THROWS, ABLE TO
[ct=5564.712] SQUEEZE THEM IN THEIRE.
[ct=5579.514] AL: STAFFORD CAME OVER IN ONE OF
[ct=5580.265] THE BIGGEST TRADES EVER.
[ct=5582.997] JARED GOFF GOES THE OTHER WAY.
[ct=5585.340] HOW IS HE DOING?
[ct=5588.130] KIRK: REALLY WELL.
[ct=5593.262] BIG WIN LAST WEEK ON THE ROAD
[ct=5602.947] IT IS A RARE WIN-WIN FOR BOTH
[ct=5602.947] TEAMS.
[ct=5607.133] WILLIAMS BACK IN.
[ct=5613.738] STAFFORD PROTECTED WELL.
[ct=5617.980] HITS WILLIAMS.
[ct=5618.495] CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5622.292] ABOUT A YARD SHY.
[ct=5623.591] MAKE IT THIRD AND 1.
[ct=5626.465] KIRK: THIS RAMS OFFENSE THIS
[ct=5628.361] DRIVE, A LOT OF PLAY-ACTION.
[ct=5632.305] THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROTECT
[ct=5633.002] AGAINST THE AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE.
[ct=5636.162] THEY ARE FRUSTRATED RIGHT NOW.
[ct=5641.477] WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT, BECAUSE
[ct=5643.840] THEY ARE ON SCHEDULE SO MUCH, IT
[ct=5645.119] IS NOT AS EASY TO DIAL UP THOSE
[ct=5645.490] PRESSURES.
[ct=5660.802] AL: A LITTLE SHORT OF THE FIRST
[ct=5663.547] THE RAMS BROUGHT EVERYBODY
[ct=5664.108] INSIDE.
[ct=5670.224] THE VIKINGS ARE ABLE TO JUST GET
[ct=5671.979] ENOUGH PRESSURE.
[ct=5674.758] KIRK: YOU SEE HIM OUT HERE.
[ct=5678.740] HE CANNOT BOUNCE IT.
[ct=5680.320] NOWHERE TO GO.
[ct=5685.415] I THINK IT IS CLOSE ENOUGH.
[ct=5687.633] STAFFORD COULD SNEAK IT.
[ct=5691.301] AL: SEAN MCVAY IS OUT ON THE
[ct=5692.006] FIELD ASKING IF WE CAN MEASURE?
[ct=5693.944] KIRK: IT IS HALF A YARD.
[ct=5696.483] AL: HE CAME ALL THE WAY OUT.
[ct=5706.529] GETS FREE, WILLIAMS, AFTER
[ct=5707.766] GETTING STOPPED IN THE
[ct=5713.088] HE HAS JUST ENOUGH TO PICK UP
[ct=5713.379] THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5716.932] KIRK: I KEEP SAYING, IT IS
[ct=5718.285] JUST ABOUT WHAT HE DOES AS A
[ct=5718.285] RECEIVER.
[ct=5721.057] I AM GETTING BEHIND THIS GUY.
[ct=5724.506] HE WILL TAKE ON THAT LINEBACKER.
[ct=5727.649] HE FINISHES THE BLOCK.
[ct=5728.172] THAT IS BEAUTIFUL.
[ct=5733.675] AL: THAT IS THE OVERLOOKED THING
[ct=5734.049] ABOUT HIM.
[ct=5738.467] HE IS SUCH A GOOD RECEIVER, YOU
[ct=5738.688] FORGET WHAT ELSE HE CAN DO.
[ct=5744.003] JOHNSON IN MOTION.
[ct=5748.255] NOT MUCH HAPPENING ON THE
[ct=5748.958] GROUND.
[ct=5760.319] KIRK: BRIAN FLOREZ TOLD ME ABOUT
[ct=5760.319] THEM COMING OVER FROM HOUSTON.
[ct=5768.337] THIS GUY IS A LUNCH PAIL GUY.

[ct=5776.934] THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL PLAY.
[ct=5784.459] AL: EIGHT MINUTES LEFT IN THE
[ct=5784.459] FOURTH.

[ct=5798.234] KIRK: YOU WILL HAVE THE
[ct=5798.970] OFFENSIVE HOLDING BY MURPHY.
[ct=5804.326] AL: THE CROWD IS CHANTING "COOP
[ct=5806.442] ."
[ct=5809.136] IF IT GOES AGAINST THE RAMS,
[ct=5811.093] THEY WILL GO "BOO."
[ct=5813.890] THE OFFICIALS DISCUSSING IT.
[ct=5817.408] REFEREE: PASS INTERFERENCE,
[ct=5817.632] DEFENSE, NUMBER SEVEN.
[ct=5820.335] THE BALL WILL BE PLACED AT THE
[ct=5820.908] SPOT OF THE FOUL.

[ct=5837.245] AL: THE RAMS HAVE NOT PICKED UP
[ct=5838.641] FIVE FIRST DOWNS BY PENALTY.
[ct=5850.744] KIRK: SEAN MCVAY SAID THEY HAVE
[ct=5851.462] TO FINISH DRIVES.

[ct=5913.462] CHARTS ON THE NIGHT.
[ct=5919.539] 13TH TIME IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.
[ct=5923.051] WHEN WILL THE FANS AROUND THE
[ct=5923.725] LEAGUE RECOGNIZE NUMBER 23 OUT
[ct=5924.150] HERE?
[ct=5925.338] HE IS THE REAL DEAL.

[ct=6027.308] THE TEXANS AGAINST THE JETS.
[ct=6031.621] WE HOPE THE GAME WILL BE
[ct=6031.991] DRAMATIC.
[ct=6035.822] THERE IS ALWAYS HIGH DRAMA WITH
[ct=6036.243] THE NEW YORK JETS.
[ct=6044.528] WE LOVE TO TALK ABOUT IT.
[ct=6052.102] THE VIKINGS NOW DOWN BY EIGHT.
[ct=6056.923] THEY WILL START AT THE 30.
[ct=6063.351] KIRK: IT HAS BEEN A GREAT NIGHT
[ct=6063.723] FOR JUSTIN JEFFERSON.

[ct=6071.356] HE HAS THE ABILITY TO HURT YOU.
[ct=6075.311] YOU KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO TRY
[ct=6075.727] TO GET HIM THE BALL.
[ct=6082.732] THE RAMS WILL PROBABLY PUT A
[ct=6084.205] CORNER ON THE OUTSIDE AND
[ct=6084.417] SAFETIES ON THE INSIDE.
[ct=6089.892] HE IS MOVING ALREADY IN MOTION.

[ct=6105.680] JOSH OLIVER.
[ct=6112.536] KIRK: YOU HAVE A MAN COVERAGE.
[ct=6115.655] THIS IS A BUST BY THE RAMS
[ct=6119.639] LOOK AT ALL THE DEFENSIVE BACKS.
[ct=6123.944] NOBODY STAYS WITH JOSH OLIVER.
[ct=6127.479] HE IS A LITTLE HESITANT TO GET
[ct=6131.920] I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IDENTIFY
[ct=6132.693] THEM AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=6135.288] HE WAS ABLE TO SLIP OUT.
[ct=6138.307] GREAT WAY TO START THIS DRIVE.

[ct=6182.777] GOING UP AGAINST QUIZZING BARRY
[ct=6187.977] -- QUISENBERRY AT THE LEFT
[ct=6188.250] TACKLE SPOT.
[ct=6190.839] LOOK AT HIM.
[ct=6194.813] THE ATHLETIC ABILITY.
[ct=6200.149] YOU CANNOT RUN AWAY.
[ct=6208.269] HE HAS POWER, QUICKNESS, HE IS
[ct=6208.269] FIRED UP.
[ct=6217.447] UNDER PRESSURE AGAIN.
[ct=6220.589] NOBODY HOME.
[ct=6227.203] KIRK: THESE LINEBACKERS HAVE
[ct=6229.207] ALLOWED A LOT OF THESE ROUTES TO
[ct=6229.657] GET BEHIND THEM.
[ct=6235.748] HERE ON 3RD AVENUE LONG, MUCH
[ct=6238.167] BETTER AT TAKING THAT AWAY.
[ct=6245.212] NO ONE WAS OPEN.
[ct=6253.255] AL: THE VIKINGS FORCED INTO A
[ct=6256.733] POSITION WHERE THEY WILL MOST
[ct=6257.522] LIKELY HAVE TO USE THEIR
[ct=6258.071] TIMEOUTS ON THE EVENTS.
[ct=6261.742] THE PUNT IS FAIR CAUGHT AT THE

[ct=6291.825] 31ST GAME WITH OVER 100 YARDS
[ct=6291.825] RECEIVING.
[ct=6296.603] AL: THE RAMS NOW FROM THE 19.
[ct=6306.169] THE VIKINGS HAVE TO THINK
[ct=6307.545] USING THEIR TIMEOUTS ON THIS
[ct=6307.765] SIDE OF THE BALL.
[ct=6310.796] THEY ARE DOWN ONE TIMEOUT
[ct=6311.584] BECAUSE THEY USE ONE EARLIER.
[ct=6317.246] KIRK: YOU HAVE TO GET OFF THE
[ct=6318.866] FIELD AND GIVE THE OFFENSE A
[ct=6323.560] SEAN MCVAY, HIS TEAMS HAVE BEEN
[ct=6323.560] SO CLOSE.
[ct=6325.963] ALL OF THESE ONE POSSESSION
[ct=6326.178] GAMES.
[ct=6329.437] A CLOSE LOST TO CHICAGO, GREEN
[ct=6329.857] BAY.

[ct=6341.676] AL: THE VIKINGS ARE OFF TO A
[ct=6343.035] GOOD START IN A SITUATION WHERE
[ct=6344.414] THEY REALLY NEED A THREE AND
[ct=6348.315] THEY TAKE THEIR FIRST OF THE TWO
[ct=6349.851] TIMEOUTS REMAINING RIGHT HERE.
[ct=6353.981] KIRK: THIS OFFENSIVE LINE HAS
[ct=6355.527] HAD A MUCH BETTER GAME THAN I
[ct=6358.942] THINK ANYBODY WOULD TALK ABOUT.
[ct=6364.318] NOW THESE FIRST COUPLE OF PLAYS,
[ct=6365.052] A COUPLE OF OBVIOUS RUN.
[ct=6369.240] NOW IT IS THIRD AND LONG.
[ct=6380.564] AL: I THINK HE IS ROLLING THE
[ct=6380.564] DICE.
[ct=6385.730] KIRK: WITH A QUARTERBACK WHO HE
[ct=6386.494] TRUSTS AND RECEIVERS YOU KNOW HE
[ct=6386.707] CAN MAKE PLAYS.
[ct=6389.778] YOU ARE TRUSTING YOUR OFFENSIVE
[ct=6390.937] LINE TO GIVE STAFFORD TIME.
[ct=6395.993] IF HE HAS TIME, CHANCES ARE HE
[ct=6396.237] WILL FIND AN OPEN MAN.
[ct=6407.001] AL: NACUA TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=6409.801] THIRD AND 9.
[ct=6413.684] STAFFORD LOOKED TO HIM.
[ct=6417.318] IT IS CAUGHT BY COOPER KUPP.
[ct=6425.190] HE STARTED WITH A COUPLE OF
[ct=6425.982] CATCHES BUT HAS BEEN VERY QUIET
[ct=6426.471] SINCE THEN.
[ct=6428.816] A BIG TIME PLAYED HERE.
[ct=6432.214] KIRK: THEY GET LOST IN COVERAGE
[ct=6432.589] WITHOUT MOTION.
[ct=6436.571] HE DID SAY LATE BREAK.
[ct=6437.830] AND HE DOES NOT FIND THE
[ct=6438.130] FOOTBALL.
[ct=6444.614] THE MOTION, THE STACKS RECEIVER,
[ct=6444.954] LOSING COOPER KUPP.
[ct=6448.957] BY THE TIME HE COMES OVER, HE
[ct=6449.335] CANNOT LOCATE THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=6452.074] GOOD JOB WORKING BACK BY COOPER
[ct=6456.522] KUPP, BACK TO THE FOOTBALL,
[ct=6457.489] INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR IT, HE
[ct=6458.097] WENT AND GOT IT.
[ct=6461.148] YOU TRUST YOUR QUARTERBACK AND
[ct=6464.144] YOUR RECEIVERS AND YOU PROBABLY
[ct=6465.384] HAVE A CHANCE TO SECURE VICTORY
[ct=6465.384] WITH THAT PLAY CALL.
[ct=6468.645] AL: THEY FORCED MINNESOTA TO USE
[ct=6469.085] THEIR FINAL TIMEOUT.
[ct=6475.163] BOOM ONE CLOCK STOPPAGE REMAINS
[ct=6475.729] OF THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=6481.764] COOPER KUPP, ALL OF THE CHATTER
[ct=6481.764] ABOUT A TRADE.
[ct=6485.097] SOME BIG TIME RECEIVERS HAVE
[ct=6487.926] GONE IN DEALS OVER THE LAST
[ct=6488.189] WEEK.
[ct=6491.908] GOING BACK TO WHAT WE TALKED
[ct=6492.459] ABOUT EARLIER.
[ct=6496.418] IF YOU ARE 2-5 YOU ARE LISTENING
[ct=6499.399] A LOT CLOSER THAT AT 3-4.
[ct=6504.860] KIRK: THEY WERE 3-6 A YEAR AGO
[ct=6505.378] BUT STILL MAY THE POSTSEASON.
[ct=6507.781] NOW YOU ARE ON THE VERGE OF
[ct=6510.755] GOING 3-4.
[ct=6514.939] WINNING TWO GAMES IN FIVE DAYS.
[ct=6519.051] I DON'T SEE THEM MOVING GUYS.
[ct=6523.181] AL: IF NOTHING ELSE, THE PRICE
[ct=6524.636] JUST WENT UP.
[ct=6527.493] THEY KEEP IT ON THE GROUND.
[ct=6535.017] KIRK: WITH THE TWO-MINUTE
[ct=6535.453] WARNING, A FIRST DOWN INTO THE
[ct=6539.910] GAME -- THEY STILL HAVE A LONG
[ct=6540.188] WAY TO GO.
[ct=6545.420] IT IS NOT OVER YET.
[ct=6564.499] JUST STAYING IN BOUNDS.
[ct=6566.224] DOES HE?
[ct=6568.203] HE DOES.
[ct=6572.674] YOU DO NOT WANT TO STEP OUT OF
[ct=6573.285] BOUNDS AND GIVE THEM SOME EXTRA
[ct=6575.799] THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE
[ct=6576.262] TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=6580.449] KIRK: A HECKUVA JOB BY MURPHY
[ct=6582.039] HOLY OFF ROBINSON.
[ct=6585.272] VAN DINGELL RUNNING.
[ct=6588.653] LOOKING AT THE CLOCK AND HOPING
[ct=6588.944] THEY WILL GET ONE MORE SHOT.
[ct=6599.752] AL: THE RAMS WILL HAVE A THIRD
[ct=6602.882] AND 12 WHEN WE COME BACK.
[ct=6615.121] -- POSTING SHOW.
[ct=6621.347] KIRK: WE THOUGHT THEY WOULD GIVE
[ct=6621.781] CONFIDENCE.
[ct=6631.396] THEY DON'T RUN IT.
[ct=6636.951] MAKING SURE HE STAYS IN BOUNDS.
[ct=6639.655] THAT WILL GET REALLY CLOSE.
[ct=6642.553] KIRK: I THINK HE STEPPED OUT OF
[ct=6642.786] BOUNDS.
[ct=6645.267] AL: AND HE DID NOT GET A FIRST
[ct=6648.920] KIRK: WOW.
[ct=6653.739] AL: NACUA ALMOST WENT OUT OF
[ct=6657.987] THEY WERE TRYING TO FORCE THEM
[ct=6661.083] THAT IS HUGE.
[ct=6669.511] NOW YOU HAVE TO PUNT.
[ct=6675.581] BRANDON POWELL BACK AT THE 10
[ct=6683.697] LAST TIME HE PUT SOME GOOD
[ct=6683.923] BACKSPIN AUDIT.
[ct=6688.186] -- ON IT.
[ct=6692.117] WHAT A KICK.
[ct=6696.381] SPOTTED AT THE 3.
[ct=6696.381] HE DOES IT AGAIN.
[ct=6703.269] THAT IS CLUTCH.
[ct=6708.567] HE HAS NOT DONE A GREAT JOB
[ct=6708.567] PUNTING.
[ct=6711.193] HE IS THE KICKOFF MAN.
[ct=6720.541] NOW THEY JUST HAVE TO GO 97
[ct=6722.226] YARDS AND MAKE A TWO-POINT
[ct=6722.555] CONVERSION.
[ct=6726.253] I A KEEPING AN EYE ON THAT LEFT
[ct=6734.004] NOW THEY WILL TRY TO DIAL UP
[ct=6742.459] THEY MIGHT WANT TO MOVE THE
[ct=6742.777] POCKET.
[ct=6746.538] AL: 95 YARDS TO GO.
[ct=6749.835] THAT PASS IS UNDERTHROWN A
[ct=6750.210] LITTLE BIT.
[ct=6756.156] IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND 10.
[ct=6757.838] A LATE FLAG HAS COME IN.
[ct=6765.297] OFFENSE, NUMBER 18, WAS NOT ON
[ct=6765.297] THE LINE.
[ct=6768.546] THAT PENALTY WILL BE DECLINED.
[ct=6775.476] AL: SECOND DOWN AND 10.
[ct=6781.144] KIRK: THE MOST IMPORTANT THING,
[ct=6781.925] I DON'T CARE THAT THEY ARE
[ct=6786.626] PINNED BACK, WHERE IS 18?
[ct=6790.709] THE RAMS ARE THINKING PRESSURE
[ct=6790.988] OVER THE LEFT TACKLE.
[ct=6793.603] WHERE IS NUMBER 18 LINED UP?
[ct=6797.084] HE IS MOVING FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
[ct=6798.260] ALL THE WAY AT THE TOP.
[ct=6806.299] AL: LOOK OUT, SAFETY.
[ct=6808.007] YOUNG.
[ct=6814.070] TAKES HIM DOWN IN THE END ZONE.
[ct=6817.093] RAMS SEAL IT.
[ct=6819.547] 30-20.
[ct=6822.352] KIRK: SOMETHING HAPPENED TO
[ct=6826.984] MAYBE HE GRABBED UNDERNEATH AND
[ct=6828.141] GOT THE JERSEY.
[ct=6829.837] SOMETHING MADE HIS HEAD GO BACK.
[ct=6833.336] THE LEFT SIDE IS WHERE THE
[ct=6833.764] PRESSURE CAME FROM.
[ct=6837.255] YOUNG WORKS THROUGH IT.
[ct=6840.968] HE GOT A HOLD OF SOMETHING.
[ct=6841.153] LET'S SEE.
[ct=6843.690] HE GOT THE FACEMASK.
[ct=6845.319] HE SURE DID.
[ct=6850.230] THEY CANNOT REVIEW THAT.
[ct=6853.744] BUT HE DEFINITELY GOT THE
[ct=6853.744] FACEMASK.
[ct=6856.444] RIGHT THERE.
[ct=6860.626] ANYTIME YOU SEE A GUYS HEAD GETS
[ct=6862.826] SPUN BACKWARD, SOMETHING
[ct=6863.247] HAPPENED.
[ct=6865.277] HE GOT AWAY WITH ONE RIGHT
[ct=6868.921] AL: FIGHTING FANS ARE SAYING
[ct=6868.921] WHAT THE HELL?
[ct=6877.070] KIRK: THERE ARE A LOT OF
[ct=6877.070] DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN REVIEW.
[ct=6883.177] AL: THEY MISTED.
[ct=6885.380] -- MISSED IT.
[ct=6887.951] KIRK: THE DEFENSE BASICALLY WON
[ct=6890.963] THE GAME A WEEK AGO.
[ct=6894.822] THEY STEP UP HERE IN A BIG WAY
[ct=6895.257] LATE.
[ct=6901.087] AL: THAT IS NOT A REVIEWABLE
[ct=6901.087] SITUATION.
[ct=6905.261] KIRK: THAT IS A FACEMASK.
[ct=6914.495] AL: THEY WILL GET CREDIT FOR TWO
[ct=6916.238] POINTS.
[ct=6919.360] KIRK: THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FIRST
[ct=6925.869] AND 10 AT THE 20 WITH 1:36 LEFT
[ct=6926.282] IN THE GAME.
[ct=6935.332] AL: MEANWHILE, THE VIKINGS HAVE
[ct=6937.756] THE CLARE FOR AN ONSIDE KICK,
[ct=6937.756] FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH.
[ct=6940.447] IT HAS TO GO 10 YARD.
[ct=6957.865] REFEREE: TIMEOUT, LOS ANGELES.
[ct=6961.783] AL: THE CHANCES OF THEM WINNING
[ct=6961.783] THE GAME WOULD'VE STILL BEEN
[ct=6962.013] MINIMAL.
[ct=6966.290] KIRK: BUT IT IS A FIRST DOWN AND
[ct=6967.854] IT GETS YOU OUT OF THE SHADOW OF
[ct=6968.326] YOUR OWN GOAL LINE.
[ct=6973.191] AND YOU HAVE JUSTIN JEFFERSON
[ct=6974.880] AND THESE RECEIVERS, WHO KNOWS
[ct=6975.104] WHAT HAPPENS.
[ct=6976.748] AL: HUMAN ERROR.
[ct=6979.420] KIRK: IT IS PART OF THE GAME.
[ct=6985.883] AL: SEAN MCVAY'S TEAM WAS 1-
[ct=6987.302] 4.
[ct=6990.542] NOW THEY WILL LIKELY GO TO 3-4.
[ct=6996.467] THEY HAVE A MINI-BYE.
[ct=6999.954] THE THURSDAY NIGHT GAME GIVES
[ct=6999.954] YOU 10 DAYS.
[ct=7002.739] THE VIKINGS HAVE INDIANAPOLIS
[ct=7002.947] NEXT WEEK.
[ct=7008.413] THEN THEY GO TO JACKSONVILLE,
[ct=7009.148] TENNESSEE, AND CHICAGO.
[ct=7021.496] KIRK: THE RAMS, ONCE THEY GET
[ct=7027.197] THERE STARTERS BACK -- THEIR
[ct=7027.197] STARTERS BACK.
[ct=7041.909] AL: SOFI STADIUM, THIS IS AS
[ct=7042.274] GOOD AS IT GETS.
[ct=7045.213] KIRK: HIS FACE SAYS IT ALL.
[ct=7049.271] NOT ONLY A VICTORY, BUT TO THINK
[ct=7049.712] ABOUT WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE THE
[ct=7051.210] BYE.
[ct=7055.336] 1-4 WITH A TON OF INJURIES AND A
[ct=7055.864] LOT OF QUESTIONS.
[ct=7061.070] THEY DID NACUA AND KUPP BACK,
[ct=7063.753] THEY WIN LAST WEEK.
[ct=7066.525] THE DIVISION IS WIDE OPEN.
[ct=7069.656] AL: DO NOT WRITE THEM OFF.
[ct=7071.084] WHO WOULD’
[ct=7072.993] WHO WOULD'VE GUESSED, YOU KNEW
[ct=7076.398] KUPP WAS COMING BACK.
[ct=7079.631] YOU DIDN'T KNOW NACUA WAS COMING
[ct=7081.280] A DIFFERENT SITUATION.
[ct=7084.455] HERE IS THE UPCOMING SCHEDULE.
[ct=7087.970] PHILADELPHIA WILL COME IN HERE.
[ct=7093.489] BUFFALO WEEK 14, LOOKING AHEAD.
[ct=7096.494] KIRK: A DIFFERENT FEEL WHEN YOU
[ct=7099.453] PUT THOSE TWO OUT THERE.
[ct=7102.272] THE RUNNING GAME WITH WILLIAMS.
[ct=7106.447] IT IS THE OFFENSE YOU WOULD
[ct=7107.934] EXPECT FROM SEAN MCVAY AND
[ct=7111.839] WAIT UNTIL THEY GET SOME OF
[ct=7112.328] THEIR OFFENSIVE LINEMAN BACK.
[ct=7115.780] AL: SEAN MCVAY LOVES WHEN WE
[ct=7118.026] COME TO TOWN FOR A THURSDAY
[ct=7118.026] NIGHT GAME.
[ct=7124.201] A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, BAKER
[ct=7124.641] MAYFIELD CAME IN.
[ct=7126.758] WHO COULD FORGET THAT?
[ct=7133.413] HE LED THEM ON A GIGANTIC DRIVE
[ct=7134.929] AT THE END OF THE GAME.
[ct=7134.929] HELPED HIM TURN HIS CAREER
[ct=7138.698] KIRK: THE VIKINGS WILL BE JUST
[ct=7138.698] FINE.
[ct=7147.859] THEY WILL GET IT GOING.
[ct=7166.444] A BIG NIGHT FOR MATTHEW
[ct=7175.987] NACUA HAD 106 RECEIVING YARDS.
[ct=7178.025] THE RAMS GET A NICE 10 DAY
[ct=7182.841] WILLIAMS TONIGHT, 23 CARRIES, 97
[ct=7189.172] HE HAS A TOUCHDOWN NOW INTEND
[ct=7192.519] THE RAMS WHEN IT
