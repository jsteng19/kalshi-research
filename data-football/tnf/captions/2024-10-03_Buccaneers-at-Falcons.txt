[ct=4.733] COUSINS.
[ct=8.891] KAYLEE: WHAT HAS BEEN THE
[ct=9.932] BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF YOUR
[ct=9.932] TRANSITION?
[ct=16.174] KIRK: IF YOU TAKE ONE STEP BACK
[ct=16.578] AND TRY TO TAKE TWO STEPS
[ct=17.130] FORWARD.
[ct=19.135] WE TRY TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE
[ct=19.608] EACH WEEK.
[ct=24.359] KAYLEE: WHY HASN'T THIS OFFENSE
[ct=24.359] PRODUCED THE LEVEL OF TALENT IN
[ct=25.345] THE FIRST FOUR GAMES?
[ct=30.796] KIRK: WE ARE BUILDING SOMETHING
[ct=32.703] AND IT TAKES TIME AND SO MANY
[ct=34.820] PIECES HAVE TO COME TOGETHER.
[ct=38.949] WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TONIGHT
[ct=38.949] TO DO THAT.
[ct=42.492] >> THERE IS THE TRAIN MORNING
[ct=46.689] AND THOSE BOYS ARE THE TWIN SONS
[ct=48.710] OF MATT RYAN AND THERE IS THAT.
[ct=54.549] LONGTIME FALCONS QUARTERBACK,

[ct=69.074] VEGAS.
[ct=73.113] TRENTON GILL WILL KICKOFF.
[ct=76.075] ATLANTA WON THE TOSS AND THEY
[ct=76.648] WILL RECEIVE.
[ct=84.087] TODD BOWLES WITH THE BUCS, AND
[ct=87.658] THE TAMPA BAY COACH MANY YEARS
[ct=91.582] AGO, MOST RECENTLY THE RAMS
[ct=93.329] DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR.
[ct=96.151] HERE FOR THE FIRST YEAR.
[ct=103.860] THEY START AT THE 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=107.215] KIRK COUSINS.
[ct=112.087] WASHINGTON INTO THE MINNESOTA,
[ct=112.351] FOUR TOUCHDOWNS, FOUR PICKS.
[ct=117.139] THE STATISTICS DON'T SAY MUCH.
[ct=121.003] HE DID LEAD THEM TO THE
[ct=121.220] COME-FROM-BEHIND WIN AGAINST FOR
[ct=125.018] BELLA -- AGAINST PHILADELPHIA.
[ct=128.592] >> THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND
[ct=129.544] THEMSELVES, WE MENTIONED THAT IN
[ct=132.191] THE OPEN, IT'S A BIG OPPORTUNITY
[ct=132.682] TONIGHT AGAINST A VERY
[ct=133.007] AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE.
[ct=137.811] >> START FROM THE PISTOL,
[ct=140.997] ROBINSON IS THE BACK AND GETS A
[ct=141.556] COUPLE.
[ct=145.894] COUSINS COMES UP WITH
[ct=146.475] WASHINGTON, HE CAME UP AT A TIME
[ct=150.692] WHEN ROBERT GRIFFIN HAD A
[ct=152.004] SPECTACULAR ROOKIE SEASON, IT
[ct=152.004] LOOKED LIKE HE WOULD BE THE
[ct=153.142] FRANCHISE QUARTERBACK FOR A
[ct=156.027] MILLION YEARS.
[ct=157.951] EVENTUALLY IT WAS COUSINS, AND
[ct=160.329] HE GOES TO MINNESOTA AND NOW HIS
[ct=161.591] FIRST SEASON IN FALCONS UNIFORM.
[ct=169.067] SECOND AND 8.
[ct=173.629] WIDE OPEN AT THE 50 YARD LINE,
[ct=174.804] KYLE PITTS TO THE 35.
[ct=177.843] EVERYBODY IS WONDERING WHERE HAS
[ct=177.843] HE BEEN?
[ct=182.846] NO CATCHES LAST WEEK, SELDOM
[ct=182.961] USED SO FAR THIS SEASON AND THEY
[ct=183.968] GET HIM IN THE ACTION EARLY.
[ct=187.707] >> TAMPA BAY WALKS UP WITH A LOT
[ct=188.063] OF PRESSURE.
[ct=191.020] THERE HE IS, RIGHT BETWEEN THE
[ct=191.402] SAFETY AND THE CORNER.
[ct=194.861] I LOVE THIS HURRY UP.
[ct=199.978] >> 32 YARD GAIN, TO THE OUTSIDE
[ct=200.590] GOES ROBINSON.
[ct=203.869] WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SHORT
[ct=205.389] LOSS INTO A SMALL GAIN, SECOND
[ct=205.702] DOWN.
[ct=210.261] >> SACK ROBINSON WITH A REALLY
[ct=211.857] SMART, GOOD INDICATOR OF WHAT
[ct=212.263] THEY WILL TRY TO DO TONIGHT.
[ct=214.818] TODD BOWLES IS KNOWN THROUGH THE
[ct=218.024] LEAGUE, A LOT OF DEFENSIVE
[ct=219.317] COACHES LIKE TO FRAME THINGS UP
[ct=220.192] AND HE STILL CALLS THE PLACE.
[ct=222.959] SACK ROBINSON VERY AWARE OF WHAT
[ct=223.202] HE CAN DO.
[ct=228.117] MIXING IN JUST TO CHANGE THE
[ct=230.294] TEMPO, TO KEEP THEM ON THEIR
[ct=230.919] HEELS.
[ct=235.096] >> THAT COME OUT OF THEIR FIRST
[ct=235.792] HUDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=240.211] SECOND DOWN AND 7.
[ct=242.981] GOOD POCKET, THROWS A LITTLE
[ct=243.278] SHORT.
[ct=246.962] THAT IS DARNELL MOONEY.
[ct=251.399] HE WAS PICKED UP FROM CHICAGO.
[ct=254.946] THAT IS THIRD DOWN AND 7.
[ct=257.163] >> THE DECISION BUT HE DOESN’
[ct=257.838] >> THE DECISION BUT HE DOESN'T
[ct=259.846] THROW IT TO THE OUTSIDE, AND BY
[ct=262.245] BRINGING IT INSIDE IT ALLOWS
[ct=262.473] DEANS TO MAKE A PLAY ON THE
[ct=262.702] FOOTBALL.
[ct=265.828] WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE TIMING
[ct=266.159] OF LITTLE THINGS.
[ct=272.189] THEY MIGHT GET OVERLOOKED AND
[ct=274.302] THAT IS ON THE OUTSIDE SHOULDER
[ct=274.302] INTO COMPLETION.
[ct=287.466] >> 7 THIRD AND -- THIRD AND 7.
[ct=291.089] THE FALCONS ON THE MOVE, MUCH AS
[ct=294.102] THE BUCS WERE AGAINST
[ct=295.404] PHILADELPHIA LAST WEEK.
[ct=299.174] >> DRAKE LONDON WILL BE ALL OVER
[ct=301.804] THE PLACE, GOOD SIZE, DOWN IN
[ct=303.343] THE ZONE, MAKES IT EASY FOR
[ct=305.817] COUSINS WHO HAD TIME TO THROW
[ct=308.334] THE FOOTBALL LOOK OVER THE
[ct=308.664] MIDDLE OF THE DEFENSE.
[ct=309.501] WHERE THEY LIKE TO ATTACK,
[ct=312.323] INPUTTED ON THE MONEY.
[ct=318.746] >> GAIN OF 15.
[ct=320.899] HANDS THIS TO ROBINSON AND HE
[ct=321.133] GOES NOWHERE.
[ct=325.497] INTO THE BACKFIELD, MAKING THE
[ct=330.797] STOP, THE BUCS SECOND DOWN AND
[ct=330.797] 10.
[ct=332.546] THE ROOKIE OUT OF GEORGIA MAKES
[ct=332.790] THE TACKLE.
[ct=336.530] >> DOING A GOOD JOB GETTING A
[ct=337.752] LOT OF DIFFERENT HANDS ON THE
[ct=339.049] FOOTBALL, MIXING UP FORMATIONS,
[ct=340.367] IT'S NOT JUST GETTING INTO DRAKE
[ct=342.809] LONDON, IT'S NOT JUST REALLY,
[ct=344.389] THEY'VE TRIED BOTH OF THEM.
[ct=350.184] AS A COLLEGE FOOTBALL GUY, FITS
[ct=350.439] IS ABOUT AS DOMINATING AS I'VE
[ct=352.389] SEEN THE LAST FIVE OR 10 YEARS
[ct=354.620] AND I LOVE SEEING HIM GET HIS
[ct=355.983] HANDS ON THE FOOTBALL EARLY.
[ct=358.290] >> OVER THE MIDDLE, IT IS
[ct=359.458] CAUGHT.
[ct=363.174] DRAKE LONDON FOR THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=372.267] THEY MAKE IT LOOK VERY EASY.
[ct=376.885] ONLY TAKES THREE MINUTES AND SIX
[ct=378.527] SECONDS, SEVEN PLAYS, 70 YARDS
[ct=378.789] AND SIX POINTS.
[ct=390.234] >> SEURAT CA -- DENNIS IS OUT OF
[ct=390.402] THE GAME.
[ct=394.334] TAPPED ON THE OPENING DRIVE,
[ct=397.799] QUITE A BIT OVER THE MIDDLE
[ct=398.631] AGAINST THOSE LINEBACKERS.
[ct=403.476] >> THE EXTRA POINT.
[ct=408.626] THE FALCONS LAST WEEK WON
[ct=409.735] AGAINST NEW ORLEANS AND DID NOT
[ct=409.920] SCORE AN OFFENSIVE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=412.655] TONIGHT IT TAKES A LITTLE OVER
[ct=413.407] THREE MINUTES IN ATLANTA IS UP
[ct=415.017] 7-0.
[ct=424.440] SOFI NBA PLAY.
[ct=430.705] FIRST OFFENSIVE TD IN THE LAST
[ct=432.307] SEVEN DRIVES, THIS IS A RETURN
[ct=432.626] KICK.
[ct=436.687] FIELDED AT THE FOUR YARD LINE BY
[ct=436.971] TUCKER.
[ct=438.315] DOWN THE SIDELINE HE GOES FOR A
[ct=441.511] NICE RUN PAST THE 35 YARD LINE.
[ct=447.557] IF YOU'RE MAYFIELD, QUITE THE
[ct=448.115] JOURNEY, WHAT AN ODYSSEY.
[ct=451.923] NUMBER ONE OVERALL PICK BY
[ct=452.498] CLEVELAND, HE WAS GOING TO BE
[ct=452.729] THE GUY.
[ct=455.874] GOOD START AND THAT FIZZLED AT
[ct=456.195] THE END.
[ct=459.633] DESHAUN WATSON LET HIM OUT THE
[ct=461.199] DOOR, HE GOES TO CAROLINA, AND
[ct=465.509] THEN WINDS UP WITH THE RAMS AND
[ct=466.582] RESETS HIS CAREER ON THAT
[ct=468.644] THURSDAY NIGHT A COUPLE YEARS
[ct=468.644] AGO, LEADING A DRIVE AT THE END
[ct=468.992] OF THE GAME.
[ct=472.127] SIGNED TO TAMPA LAST YEAR, DOES
[ct=475.260] WELL ENOUGH WITH A THREE YEAR,
[ct=476.080] $100 MILLION CONTRACT.
[ct=479.586] WHITE IN THE BACKFIELD AT THE 37
[ct=479.873] YARD LINE.
[ct=485.405] FIRES, CAUGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE
[ct=485.963] OF THE 50 YARD LINE.
[ct=491.638] MIKE EVANS, GOING INTO LAST
[ct=492.978] WEEK'S GAME, HE WASN’T LOOKING
[ct=496.628] ENOUGH AND THEY HAD A MAMA FOR
[ct=496.931] TO PASS OF THE GAME LAST WEEK.
[ct=502.010] >> ONE WAY TO CLOSE IN ON THREE
[ct=502.589] TARGETS AGAINST DENVER LAST WEEK
[ct=502.861] AND HERE HE IS.
[ct=509.770] ANYBODY CHEERING FOR A COMEBACK
[ct=510.300] STORY, HE WOULD BE THE FIRST
[ct=513.711] ONES WITH MID HE HAS A LOT TO
[ct=513.711] LEARN.
[ct=515.316] HE LOOKS AT THINGS THROUGH
[ct=516.344] DIFFERENT WINS NOW.
[ct=522.742] -- DIFFERENT LENS NOW.
[ct=524.220] >> LITTLE RUN HEREBY WHITE.
[ct=528.435] ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THEY'VE HAD
[ct=529.091] HIS RUNNING.
[ct=530.933] THE BALL WE WILL ALSO SEE A LOT
[ct=534.720] OF BUCKY IRVING TONIGHT.
[ct=538.443] >> THIS LINE I THINK IS A WORK
[ct=538.950] IN PROGRESS.
[ct=545.856] THEY ARE REALLY BUILT, IF YOU GO
[ct=550.229] BACK TO TOM BRADY, LEARNING HOW
[ct=551.957] TO BECOME MORE PHYSICAL AND HOW
[ct=553.914] TO RUN THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=556.819] >> NEARLY PICKED OFF.
[ct=560.548] EVANS WAS THE INTENDED RECEIVER.
[ct=564.469] THROWN OUT IN FRONT.
[ct=567.578] MAYFIELD IS LOOKING FOR A PLAYER
[ct=568.504] WANTS TO KNOW WHY HIS RECEIVER
[ct=568.758] WAS HELD UP.
[ct=573.656] >> GOOD MATCHUP TONIGHT, TERREL
[ct=574.247] A LOT OF TIMES WILL SHADOW THE
[ct=574.475] RECEIVER.
[ct=578.298] I THINK THAT'S WHAT BAKER WAS
[ct=580.246] ASKING FOR, IT IMPACTED HIM
[ct=581.409] TRYING TO WORK INTO THE MIDDLE
[ct=581.650] OF THE FIELD.
[ct=586.993] TERRY WAVING IT OFF AND SAY NO
[ct=587.952] INTERFERENCE.
[ct=590.455] HE IS HELPING US EVERY THURSDAY
[ct=590.736] NIGHT.
[ct=593.161] >> THANK GOD.
[ct=593.161] [LAUGHTER]
[ct=596.603] MAYFIELD FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE
[ct=598.278] OF TRAFFIC AND THAT IS PULLED
[ct=599.594] IN.
[ct=602.683] THAT IS EVANS, FORWARD PROGRESS
[ct=603.159] WILL NET HIM A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=605.891] EVANS COULD BE A FIRST BALLOT
[ct=606.210] HALL OF FAMER.
[ct=610.294] EVERY YEAR, OVER 1000 YARDS, HAS
[ct=610.569] TO COME OUT FOR A SECOND.
[ct=613.011] >> A GREAT JOB OF GETTING THE
[ct=616.481] BALL OUT, WATCH THE SAFETY, HE
[ct=616.481] IS FEELING THE 13 AND EVANS WILL
[ct=616.977] GET THIS FOOTBALL.
[ct=621.447] BECAUSE HE GOT TO AN EARLY
[ct=623.119] ENOUGH, HE COULD SECURE THE
[ct=623.390] FOOTBALL AND TAKE CARE OF
[ct=626.049] HIMSELF BEFORE BATES COULD
[ct=626.565] DISLODGE THE BALL.
[ct=630.100] DECISIVE DECISION.
[ct=633.030] >> ROOKIE OUT OF BARTON COMES
[ct=635.684] TOSS BACK.
[ct=641.116] WHITE WILL BE SHOT DOWN AFTER A
[ct=645.237] GAIN OF ONE, MAKING IT SECOND
[ct=648.745] AND 9 FOR THE BUCS.
[ct=652.148] >> YOU MENTIONED BUCKY IRVING, I
[ct=652.749] THINK THE PRESENCE OF HAS PUSHED
[ct=654.914] WHITE TO RUN TOUGHER.
[ct=659.419] >> KAMERON JOHNSON JUST CAME
[ct=660.810] INTO THE GAME WHEN EVANS HAD TO
[ct=661.908] GO OUT, SO HE WOULD BE IN CLOSED
[ct=663.278] THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE IS ABOUT
[ct=663.514] A DATE.
[ct=670.152] -- TEMPERATURE IS ABOUT 80.
[ct=674.070] SECOND DOWN AND NINE.
[ct=676.571] THE RUNNING GAME, THEY ARE
[ct=678.236] HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING
[ct=679.147] ANYTHING GOING AND THAT HAS BEEN
[ct=682.897] THE CASE FOR THE LAST TWO RUNS,
[ct=683.452] THIRD DOWN AND NINE.
[ct=685.762] KIRK: THE DEFENSE FROM ATLANTA
[ct=689.439] IS TROY ANDERSEN.
[ct=691.844] HE IS OUT WITH A KNEE.
[ct=695.264] SO A ROOKIE OUT OF NOTRE DAME IS
[ct=699.448] BOTH LINEBACKERS GETTING
[ct=700.015] DOWNHILL IN A HURRY.
[ct=703.447] THEY WILL MISS ANDERSON TONIGHT.
[ct=710.044] AL: PICK SIX ALSO.
[ct=710.699] THIRD AND NINE. CAUGHT.
[ct=713.764] HE GOES TO THE TIGHT END.
[ct=717.685] BUT IS CADE OTTON.
[ct=722.529] TACKLED BY JD BERTRAND.
[ct=726.398] KIRK: HE WAS USING HIS EYES TO
[ct=729.379] MOVE THE SAFETIES TO GIVE THEM A
[ct=730.722] CHANCE AT THAT NEXT LEVEL.
[ct=730.895] SECOND DOWN.
[ct=733.345] GREAT TIME TO GO TO THIS CALL.
[ct=737.713] BAKER MAYFIELD WAS LOOKING LEFT,
[ct=739.587] LOOKING LEFT.
[ct=742.187] HE LOOKED AT THE SAFETY, BATES.
[ct=743.773] A NICELY EXECUTED PLAY.
[ct=748.722] AL: HE GOT THE GAME-WINNING
[ct=751.395] TOUCHDOWN BETWEEN THE BUCS AND
[ct=752.352] THE FALCONS LAST YEAR.
[ct=754.758] IT IS A FIRST DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=758.092] CHRIS GODWIN MAKING THE GRAB.
[ct=760.605] WE KNOW HE IS A GREAT RECEIVER
[ct=761.717] BUT WHEN YOU PLAY WITH MIKE
[ct=763.122] EVANS, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE THE
[ct=763.349] SECOND GUY.
[ct=767.399] KIRK: WE TALKED ABOUT THIS THIS
[ct=767.638] MORNING.
[ct=769.464] HE GETS OVERLOOKED.
[ct=772.752] HE IS AS CONSISTENT AND DURABLE
[ct=772.983] AS YOU CAN ASK FOR.
[ct=775.900] NOT CONCERNED AT ALL ABOUT
[ct=776.144] TAKING THE HIT.
[ct=778.493] HE HOLDS ONTO THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=781.053] BOTH OF THESE QUARTERBACKS ARE
[ct=783.518] COMING OUT ON FIRE AND THROWING
[ct=784.520] THE FOOTBALL WITH GREAT
[ct=784.520] ACCURACY.
[ct=788.409] AL: AND THERE IS KAMERON JOHNSON
[ct=791.048] TRYING TO WORK IT OUT ALONG THE
[ct=791.321] SIDELINE.
[ct=792.049] AND YOU HAVE THE INJURED FALCON
[ct=797.049] AT THE 2 YARD LINE AND IT WILL
[ct=798.961] BE FIRST AND GOAL WHEN PLAY
[ct=798.961] RESUMES.
[ct=803.350] ALFORD IS A DEFENSIVE BACK AND
[ct=806.169] HE HAS TO COME OUT OF THE GAME
[ct=807.033] BEFORE THE FIRST AND GOAL.
[ct=816.589] THIS IS THE NINTH PLAY OF THE
[ct=820.732] DRIVE THAT BEGAN AT THEIR OWN 37
[ct=824.806] IF YOU ARE JUST TUNING IN, THE
[ct=826.356] FALCONS WENT DOWN THE FIELD ON
[ct=826.865] THEIR FIRST DRIVE.
[ct=832.799] KIRK: THEY BRING IN THE ROOKIE,
[ct=836.391] BUCKY IRVING, TO THE BACKFIELD
[ct=837.306] HERE EARLY IN HIS CAREER.
[ct=840.222] A VERY PHYSICAL RUNNER WHO IS
[ct=843.363] UNDERSIZED, 5'10" BUT HE RUNS
[ct=843.993] TOUGH.
[ct=844.603] IT MAKES SENSE THEY WOULD BRING
[ct=846.616] HIM IN AND WHITE IS STILL IN
[ct=846.874] THERE WITH HIM.
[ct=850.121] YOU SEE THEM MOVE HIM OUT TO THE
[ct=850.543] RIGHT.
[ct=854.635] AL: PICKTON THE FOURTH ROUND GOT
[ct=859.003] PICKE -- PICKED IN THE FOURTH
[ct=859.404] ROUND.
[ct=866.477] FIG TOSS -- FAKE TOSS.
[ct=870.157] EVANS COMES BACK INTO THE GAME
[ct=870.157] AND SCORES.
[ct=875.570] EACH TEAM WITH A BEAUTIFULLY
[ct=877.825] EXECUTED OPENING DRIVE.
[ct=881.012] KIRK: LIAM COHEN, THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=886.398] COORDINATOR, TAKING A PAGE OUT
[ct=888.671] OF THE ANDY REID BOOK.
[ct=891.862] HE COMES BACK AND NO ONE PICKS
[ct=892.181] HIM UP.
[ct=897.303] YOU CAN SEE TERREL, THEY ARE
[ct=898.474] CONFUSED BECAUSE OF THE MOVEMENT
[ct=899.735] HALF OF THE DEFENSE IS PLAYING
[ct=899.966] MAN.
[ct=904.014] NO ONE PICKS HIM UP.
[ct=908.661] AL: MCLAUGHLIN FOR THE EXTRA
[ct=908.849] POINT.
[ct=911.086] WHEN YOU GET MIKE EVANS THAT
[ct=913.524] OPEN, IT HAS TO BE A BEAUTIFULLY
[ct=916.671] DESIGNED PLAY, OR A BUST OR
[ct=916.671] BOTH.
[ct=918.063] 7-7.
[ct=920.935] TAMPA.
[ct=922.036] 43-28.
[ct=924.691] MATT RYAN, FOUR TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=927.181] THERE HE IS.
[ct=929.176] HE WILL BE HONORED AT HALFTIME
[ct=931.196] AND OUR TONY GONZALES WILL BE
[ct=931.196] THERE.
[ct=933.501] HE IS GOING INTO THE RING OF
[ct=933.501] HONOR.
[ct=936.987] KIRK: WHAT A GREAT CAREER.
[ct=939.995] AL: A TOUCHBACK.
[ct=942.584] THIS IS GIL KICKING OFF.
[ct=946.390] KIRK: BOTH OF THE QUARTERBACKS
[ct=947.161] PLAYING VERY WELL IN THEIR
[ct=947.615] OPENING DRIVES.
[ct=952.896] THE FALCONS FIGHTING PITS --
[ct=954.179] FINDING PITTS.
[ct=957.256] THERE IS WANDA DRAKE LONDON AND
[ct=958.711] THEN OFF TO THE LEFT HE GETS THE
[ct=960.668] LINEBACKER.
[ct=962.580] READING THE EYES.
[ct=964.246] HE SHOWS A LITTLE POWER THERE
[ct=965.471] AFTER THE CATCH GETTING INTO THE
[ct=965.833] END ZONE.
[ct=968.749] THE OPENING DRIVE -- PEOPLE HAVE
[ct=971.259] BEEN WAITING FOR THE 34-YEAR-OLD
[ct=971.720] WHO CAME OVER.
[ct=975.040] THE TIMING LOOKS VERY GOOD SO
[ct=975.292] FAR TONIGHT.
[ct=979.113] AL: OFF THE FAKE.
[ct=980.648] A TON OF TIME.
[ct=984.123] RIGHT ON THE MONEY!
[ct=984.664] MOONEY, MAKING THE GRAB.
[ct=990.225] KIRK: NICE PLAY-ACTION.
[ct=991.106] WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE TIMING.
[ct=995.494] THEY GO HEAVY, THE LINEBACKERS
[ct=995.494] ARE DOWNHILL.
[ct=1000.587] THAT IS A MISMATCH WITH MOODY'S
[ct=1002.008] SPEED.
[ct=1004.029] THE BALL WAS OUT IN FRONT GIVING
[ct=1004.874] HIM A CHANCE.
[ct=1012.558] AL: AGAIN OF 20 -- A GAIN OF 20.
[ct=1013.771] THE RUNNING BACK GOES ON THE
[ct=1014.611] PATTERN AND TAKES THE PASS.
[ct=1019.096] THE TACKLE IS MADE BY YAYA THE
[ct=1020.428] ABI.
[ct=1024.481] KIRK: A LOT OF TEAMS HAVE TWO
[ct=1026.464] BACKS IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE
[ct=1026.992] LEAGUE BUT I THINK YOU COULD
[ct=1030.323] MAKE A STRONG ARGUMENT THAT IF
[ct=1030.690] ROBINSON LIVES UP TO HIS
[ct=1032.483] POTENTIAL AS A THREE DOWN BACK
[ct=1035.315] AND YOU PUT TYLER ALGIERS IN
[ct=1037.399] THERE TOGETHER, WHAT A COMBO.
[ct=1041.114] THAT PUTS SOME POP ON THE
[ct=1041.114] DEFENSE.
[ct=1050.484] AL: TYLER ALGIERS TOUCHES IT
[ct=1050.484] BACK.
[ct=1054.771] NICE RUN FOR A GAIN OF 9.
[ct=1057.879] YOU HAVE A NICE YING AND YANG
[ct=1064.593] KIRK: ALGIERS HAS A NATURAL FIT.
[ct=1067.942] HE READS THIS BETTER THAN
[ct=1070.108] ROBINSON AT THIS STAGE OF HIS
[ct=1070.108] CAREER.
[ct=1073.393] DO YOU SEE THE STEP, THE RIGHT
[ct=1078.227] STEP RIGHT THERE -- HE READS IT
[ct=1079.637] AND FEELS IT AND IS ABLE TO GET
[ct=1079.637] NORTH AND SOUTH.
[ct=1082.973] WHEN HE BUILDS THAT MOMENTUM AND
[ct=1085.243] ACCELERATES THROUGH THE HOLE, HE
[ct=1086.462] HAS A HANDFUL FOR THE SAFETIES
[ct=1087.755] TO COME UP AND TACKLE.
[ct=1092.471] AL: THE PASS WILL GET CAUGHT
[ct=1094.237] ALONG THE SIDELINE.
[ct=1096.067] GETTING FREE AGAIN IS MCLEOD.
[ct=1100.810] HE BEATS TYKEE SMITH, THE ROOKIE
[ct=1103.517] FOR A GAIN OF 15.
[ct=1108.316] KIRK: THEY CONTINUE TO MIX
[ct=1110.156] THINGS UP NICELY.
[ct=1111.503] A LOT MORE THROWING ON FIRST AND
[ct=1112.322] 10 AND NOT JUST PLAY-ACTION.
[ct=1116.247] THAT TIME THEY DROPPED BACK AND
[ct=1116.247] GOT MCLEOD INVOLVED.
[ct=1119.562] THAT IS 10.5 YARDS PER PLAY THAT
[ct=1123.380] ATLANTA IS AVERAGING IN THESE
[ct=1123.578] FIRST TWO DRIVES.
[ct=1127.631] AL: COUSINS, 102.
[ct=1130.184] HERE COMES MOODY.
[ct=1132.251] MOODY IS GOING TO THROW BUT NO
[ct=1132.967] ONE IS HOME AND HE THROWS IT
[ct=1133.355] AWAY.
[ct=1136.808] IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND 10.
[ct=1141.016] KIRK: ANYTIME A GUY HAS TO
[ct=1143.490] REVERSE, HE IS LOSING GROUND.
[ct=1146.762] ZACH ROBINSON, HE CALLED
[ct=1150.543] SOMETHING IN THESE FIRST -- THE
[ct=1152.058] ONLY TIME ZACH ROBINSON CALLED
[ct=1152.405] SOMETHING THAT DIDN’
[ct=1152.765] SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T WORK.
[ct=1156.442] AL: THERE IS TIME BOWLES ON THE
[ct=1158.506] OTHER SIDE WHO LOVES TO BLITZ
[ct=1161.407] FROM HIS YEARS IN TAMPA BAY.
[ct=1164.131] HE BLITZ IS ON 47% OF THE
[ct=1164.661] RUNNING PLAYS AND THE NFL
[ct=1168.939] AVERAGE IS LESS THAN 30% OR
[ct=1169.810] RIGHT AROUND THAT MARK, ANYWAY.
[ct=1172.836] SECOND DOWN AND 10.
[ct=1174.750] TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=1181.069] THE RUN TO THE 19 YARD LINE IS
[ct=1181.616] DRAKE LONDON AND THAT WILL SET
[ct=1187.280] UP THIRD AND 5 FOR ATLANTA.
[ct=1190.851] B JON ROBINSON COMES BACK INTO
[ct=1194.295] KIRK: IN THESE SITUATIONS WITH
[ct=1199.253] PITTS AT 6'6" AND LONDON AT
[ct=1202.842] 6'4", THOSE ARE SOME BIG TARGETS
[ct=1202.842] TO TRY TO FIND.
[ct=1207.040] AL: FLIPS TO THE LEFT SIDE.
[ct=1214.616] THIRD AND FIVE.
[ct=1214.902] UNDER PRESSURE FOR THE FIRST
[ct=1217.364] TIME AND DOWN HE GOES!
[ct=1219.970] SOONER OR LATER, THE SACK.
[ct=1227.884] THE BULLMOOSE AT 347 POUNDS.
[ct=1227.884] HOW DO YOU KEEP HIM OUT?
[ct=1231.479] KIRK: TODD BOWLES HAS SEVEN OUT
[ct=1235.369] TIGHT AND THEN THEY DROP AND IT
[ct=1237.418] CONFUSES THE OFFENSIVE LINE
[ct=1238.118] ENOUGH.
[ct=1243.224] THAT IS VITA VEA BEING --
[ct=1244.550] ROBINSON IS KNOWN FOR HIS
[ct=1246.327] ABILITY TO PICK UP THE BLITZ BUT
[ct=1248.087] HE IS NOT PICKING UP THE BIG
[ct=1250.055] FELLA COMING IN AT 350 POUNDS.
[ct=1255.610] AL: VITA VEA BUSTING THROUGH.
[ct=1261.481] KOO GOT THE 58 YARD ONE IN THE
[ct=1263.186] WIND TO WIN THE GAME.
[ct=1266.799] THE KICK FOR THE MOMENT IS NO
[ct=1269.369] GOOD.
[ct=1269.989] THE PENALTY IS INDICATED AGAINST
[ct=1274.516] AND IT WAS A FOURTH AND 14.
[ct=1276.891] RONALD TORBERT MAKES HIS FIRST
[ct=1276.891] CALL OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=1278.639] KAYLEE: OFFSIDE
[ct=1281.732] REFEREE: OFFSIDE, DEFENSE,
[ct=1284.174] NUMBER 32.
[ct=1287.967] AL: JOSH HAYESAL: TO THE
[ct=1289.253] CONSTERNATION OF THE BUCS’
[ct=1291.717] CONSTERNATION OF THE BUCS' HEAD
[ct=1291.908] COACH.
[ct=1297.270] KIRK: LINED UP THERE OFFSIDES.
[ct=1306.739] AL: SO NOW IT IS A 41 YARD
[ct=1308.188] ATTEMPT FOR KOO/
[ct=1317.138] AND THIS ONE --HE MISSES THAT
[ct=1318.043] ONE!
[ct=1322.423] ALMOST AN INSTANT REPLAY -- OF
[ct=1322.846] ALL THINGS.
[ct=1324.759] 58 TO WIN LAST WEEK.
[ct=1337.991] KAYLEE: BACK IN ATLANTA WHERE
[ct=1337.991] THE BUCCANEERS CAME INTO TOWN
[ct=1340.674] WITH FIVE RECEIVERS AVAILABLE
[ct=1342.120] AND NOW THEY ARE DOWN TO FOUR.
[ct=1345.907] KAMERON JOHNSON IS ON THE BIKE.
[ct=1347.578] HE IS QUESTIONABLE TO RETURN.
[ct=1352.303] AND DEE ALFORD IS IN THEIR
[ct=1354.547] LOCKER ROOM BEING EVALUATED FOR
[ct=1357.896] A CONCUSSION WITH THE NEURO-
[ct=1359.430] TRAUMA CONSULTANT.
[ct=1364.971] AL: THE PASS IS CAUGHT AND OFF
[ct=1367.854] TO THE RACES GOES GODWIN PICKING
[ct=1372.846] UP THE FIRST DRIVE OF THE
[ct=1376.829] FIRST PLAY -- THE FIRST DOWN OF
[ct=1378.111] THE FIRST PLAY OF THIS DRIVE.
[ct=1382.068] KIRK: HE GOT THE REDO, KOO.
[ct=1387.444] BAKER, THE BIG THING THEY WANT
[ct=1388.398] TO SEE FROM BAKER MAYFIELD IS
[ct=1390.370] LET'S STACK WEEKS TOGETHER.
[ct=1393.759] LET'S BE CONSISTENT.
[ct=1394.891] HE LOOKED GREAT LAST WEEK,
[ct=1399.473] DECISIVE AND TONIGHT, HE IS
[ct=1399.473] DOING WELL.
[ct=1403.497] AL: A GOOD RUN, BREAKING TACKLES
[ct=1406.786] GOES BUCKY IRVING PROVIDING A
[ct=1407.825] SPARK FOR THE RUNNING GAME AT
[ct=1409.940] 5'10", 195.
[ct=1412.963] KIRK: GOT THE POLE AROUND THE
[ct=1414.274] GUARD.
[ct=1415.220] YOU GET SOME GOOD LOCKS.
[ct=1420.055] GOD WENT -- HE MISSED BUT HE IS
[ct=1422.044] ABLE TO GET IN THE WAY AND YOU
[ct=1423.983] THE QUICKNESS OF BUCKY IRVING
[ct=1424.924] WHO CAN ACCELERATE AT A VERY
[ct=1427.011] DIFFERENT LEVEL.
[ct=1429.290] HE RUNS WITH A CHIP ON HER
[ct=1429.290] SHOULDER.
[ct=1429.988] HE WAS AT MINNESOTA.
[ct=1432.850] MOST PEOPLE REMEMBER WHAT HE DID
[ct=1433.320] LAST YEAR AT
[ct=1435.550] YEAR.
[ct=1440.299] AL: BAKER MAYFIELD WITH THE FAKE
[ct=1440.885] AIR PROTECTION IS GOOD.
[ct=1444.294] INCOMPLETE! INTENDED FOR
[ct=1444.520] STERLING SHEPARD.
[ct=1448.183] STERLING SHEPARD HAD BEEN ON THE
[ct=1449.463] PRACTICE SQUAD AND PLAYED WITH
[ct=1450.205] THE GIANTS, EIGHTH YEAR IN THE
[ct=1450.205] LEAGUE.
[ct=1454.186] IT LOOKED LIKE HIS CAREER WAS
[ct=1455.932] OVER BUT HE AND MAYFIELD WERE
[ct=1456.563] TOGETHER AT OKLAHOMA.
[ct=1460.995] KIRK: IT IS GOOD TO SEE HIM GET
[ct=1461.845] AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING ENERGY
[ct=1462.464] TO THE TEAM LAST WEEK.
[ct=1465.578] MAYFIELD HAD THE SAFETY WRITING
[ct=1466.919] UP.
[ct=1468.662] THEY HAD THAT.
[ct=1471.121] THEY HAD OWENS SETTING IT UP
[ct=1472.132] BECAUSE MIKE EVANS IS GETTING SO
[ct=1472.562] MUCH ATTENTION.
[ct=1475.527] HE BROUGHT JUSTIN SIMMONS DOWN.
[ct=1482.891] MY GREED JUST MISSES -- MIKE
[ct=1483.956] REED JUST MISSES THE THROW.
[ct=1487.368] AL: JUST A LITTLE SHORT OF THE
[ct=1490.218] FIRST DOWN, CHRIS GODWIN AND
[ct=1490.790] JUSTIN SIMMONS MAKING THE STOP.
[ct=1494.015] THAT IS AS GOOD A PAIR OF
[ct=1494.557] RECEIVERS AS YOU WILL SEE IN THE
[ct=1496.133] LEAGUE, EVANS AND GODWIN.
[ct=1499.913] KIRK: AND I WHOEVER IRVING AND
[ct=1500.479] WHITE TOGETHER.
[ct=1503.736] ATLANTA IS PERPLEXING.
[ct=1507.327] THEY WILL BLITZ ESPECIALLY ON A
[ct=1507.607] THIRD DOWN MORE THAN ANYONE IN
[ct=1510.146] THE LEAK AND YET THEY ARE NOT
[ct=1510.545] GETTING HOME.
[ct=1513.458] THEY ARE TRYING TO SEE IT THEY
[ct=1514.487] CAN AFFECT THE TIMING AND RHYTHM
[ct=1516.842] TONIGHT OF NUMBER SIX, BAKER
[ct=1517.105] MAYFIELD.
[ct=1520.305] AL: THE BACK IS WHITE.
[ct=1521.738] A GOOD PASS.
[ct=1526.422] AND THEY SAY THE PAST IS
[ct=1527.667] INCOMPLETE GOING BEHIND GODWIN.
[ct=1532.119] MIKE HUGHES COVERING ON THE
[ct=1534.498] PLAY, A FORMER FIRST-ROUND PICK
[ct=1535.138] OF THE MINNESOTA VIKINGS.
[ct=1536.757] AND IT IS FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=1539.868] KIRK: IT GOES INTO THE BOUNDARY
[ct=1543.327] TO HIS GUY GODWIN.
[ct=1544.218] HUGHES IS SOFT.
[ct=1546.283] HE IS GOOD ON THIRD DOWN BUT HE
[ct=1547.137] DOESN'T THROW THE BALL IN FRONT
[ct=1551.218] OF HIM TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO
[ct=1551.585] MAKE THAT CATCH AND THERE IS
[ct=1551.814] NOTHING GODWIN CAN DO.
[ct=1557.836] AL: A 53 YARD FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT
[ct=1558.179] FOR CHASE GODWIN.
[ct=1562.000] THEY GET THE 11TH GUY BACK ON
[ct=1562.346] THE FIELD IN A HURRY AND FROM
[ct=1563.662] 53.
[ct=1566.443] 53 MCLAUGHLIN SENT IT RIGHT DOWN
[ct=1566.731] THE MIDDLE.
[ct=1573.805] 1:22 REMAINING IN THE QUARTER.
[ct=1581.601] AL: TODD BOWLES TOOK OVER WHEN
[ct=1583.331] BRUCE ARIANS RETIRED.
[ct=1586.750] BRUCE ARIANS WINNING THE SUPER
[ct=1588.676] BOWL TITLE WITH BRADY.
[ct=1591.395] TODD WAS THE HEAD COACH OF THE
[ct=1592.800] NEW YORK JETS FOR FOUR YEARS.
[ct=1596.559] GOT OFF TO A GOOD START.
[ct=1599.889] BUT THEN -- BUT THEN -- AND IT
[ct=1600.233] HAPPENS TO EVERYBODY.
[ct=1604.086] HE BOUNCED AROUND SINCE THEN
[ct=1605.587] GETTING ON THE STAFF ARE BRUCE
[ct=1607.611] ARIANS AS HIS DEFENSIVE
[ct=1610.467] COORDINATOR AND THEN HE ASCENDED
[ct=1611.501] TO THE TOP SPOT AND HAS TAKEN
[ct=1615.590] THE TEAM TO THE PLAYOFFS IN HIS
[ct=1616.618] TWO YEARS AT THE HELM.
[ct=1623.462] TRENTON GILL TO KICK OFF.
[ct=1627.442] AND THE NEXT PLAY WILL EMANATE
[ct=1629.323] FROM THE 30.
[ct=1633.769] KIRK: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
[ct=1635.274] AARON RODGERS COMING BACK FROM A
[ct=1636.401] TORN ACHILLES AND KIRK COUSINS,
[ct=1637.102] THE SAME THING.
[ct=1640.879] THAT RIGHT FOOT, PUSHING OFF IT
[ct=1642.141] AND 11 MONTHS LATER AFTER THE
[ct=1644.959] SURGERY, HE IS STILL TRYING TO
[ct=1646.142] GET THE CONFIDENCE IN HIS BACK
[ct=1646.523] FOOT.
[ct=1648.292] YOU CAN SEE THAT HE'LL COMING UP
[ct=1650.914] OFF THE GROUND WHICH AFFECTS THE
[ct=1650.914] VELOCITY.
[ct=1654.540] THE BALL IS DYING ON HIM A
[ct=1657.590] LITTLE IF HE IS THROWING IT 20,
[ct=1658.541] 30, 40 YARDS DOWN THE PLAY.
[ct=1663.934] A WORK IN PROGRESS TRYING TO GET
[ct=1664.844] CONFIDENCE IN THE ACHILLES AND
[ct=1665.086] WORKING WITH NEW RECEIVERS.
[ct=1670.091] AL: ROBINSON -- HE AVOIDS A
[ct=1672.668] TACKLE AND PICKS UP ABOUT SIX.
[ct=1675.502] LONDON THROUGH A NICE BLOCK TO
[ct=1677.995] SPRING HIM FOR A SIX YARD GAIN.
[ct=1679.395] SECOND DOWN AND FOUR.
[ct=1684.015] KIRK: 34 YEARS OLD, YOU COME
[ct=1685.034] INTO A NEW SYSTEM AND PEOPLE
[ct=1686.068] ASSUME IT IS GOING TO COME
[ct=1686.068] TOGETHER.
[ct=1687.839] TONIGHT HE LOOKS GREAT.
[ct=1691.511] BUT SOMETIMES IT TAKES TIME TO
[ct=1694.114] DEVELOP THAT ESPECIALLY COMING
[ct=1694.715] OFF THAT INJURY.
[ct=1697.013] AL: A NEW SYSTEM, NO OFFENSIVE
[ct=1700.501] COORDINATOR -- A NEW OFFENSIVE
[ct=1702.807] COORDINATOR.
[ct=1705.773] LOOKING FOR WOO.
[ct=1707.680] NOT MUCH THERE.
[ct=1712.972] KAYLEE: MATTHEW JUDON JUNE, A
[ct=1716.975] SURPRISING COMPARISON.
[ct=1718.555] HE SAYS HE HAS NOT LIKE LAMAR
[ct=1720.986] JACKSON, KIRK COUSINS BUT HE IS
[ct=1721.938] LIKE LAMAR IS IN BALTIMORE.
[ct=1726.789] AL: HE HAS ALWAYS HAD THAT
[ct=1727.083] REPUTATION.
[ct=1729.262] HE THROWS HERE TO MOODY TO THE
[ct=1732.742] 44 YARD LINE AND THAT WILL SET
[ct=1734.663] UP A FIRST DOWN AND PERHAPS THE
[ct=1736.547] LAST PLAY OF THE COURTS ARE.
[ct=1738.874] THEY COULD LET IT RUN DOWN.
[ct=1741.628] INSIDE 10.
[ct=1743.198] THEY COME UP TO THE LINE OF
[ct=1746.138] SCRIMMAGE TRYING TO DRAW TAMPA
[ct=1748.573] BAY OFFSIDE IF NOTHING ELSE AND
[ct=1750.338] THAT IS THE END OF THE QUARTER.
[ct=1752.744] A GOOD SPIRITED FIRST QUARTER ON
[ct=1753.094] THURSDAY NIGHT.
[ct=1762.619] AL: RED PANDA -- LOOK AT THIS!
[ct=1765.041] ON THE UNICYCLE.
[ct=1769.737] SHE MUST HAVE BEEN PHENOMENAL ON
[ct=1771.229] THE BALANCE BEAM AT ONE POINT.
[ct=1777.616] A VERY POPULAR FIGURE CURED AL
[ct=1778.280] MICHAELS WITH KIRK HERBSTREIT
[ct=1778.967] AND KAYLEE HARTUNG.
[ct=1780.433] WE ARE STARTING THE SECOND
[ct=1780.651] QUARTER.
[ct=1786.435] FROM THE 43 YARD LINE.
[ct=1787.647] BEING CHASED, ON THE MOVE AND
[ct=1787.887] THROWING IT AWAY.
[ct=1794.715] KAYLEE: MATTHEW JUDON TOLD ME
[ct=1796.385] THAT KIRK COUSINS DOESN'T STAY
[ct=1797.766] HIDDEN.
[ct=1801.209] HE IS IN THE LOCKER ROOM HANGING
[ct=1802.939] OUT LIKE ONE OF THE D LINEMAN.
[ct=1803.822] HIS AGE STILL SHOWS.
[ct=1806.949] DO DON SAYS COUSINS WILL START
[ct=1809.091] TO TALK ABOUT OLD STUFF.
[ct=1813.406] HE WILL REMIND HIM, THAT
[ct=1814.517] HAPPENED FOREVER AGO.
[ct=1817.866] AL: THE CROWD IS BOOING BECAUSE
[ct=1819.982] THEY FELT IT SHOULD'VE BEEN A
[ct=1821.531] PERSONAL FOUL ON COUSINS.
[ct=1828.251] FIRED OVER THE MIDDLE INDO
[ct=1828.532] TRAFFIC.
[ct=1833.184] -- FIRED OVER THE MIDDLE AND
[ct=1834.911] INTO TRAFFIC.
[ct=1837.066] IT WAS INTENDED FOR LONDON.
[ct=1839.609] AND WE HAVE A FLAG.
[ct=1839.858] THE SECOND PENALTY OF THE GAME.
[ct=1844.246] EITHER AN DOCKED THE FIRST WAS
[ct=1846.463] AN OFFSIDE ON A FIELD GOAL
[ct=1846.856] ATTEMPT.
[ct=1852.106] REFEREE: PERSONAL FOUL.
[ct=1854.162] UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS, DEFENSE,
[ct=1855.531] NUMBER 52.
[ct=1860.789] AL: IT IS ON K.J. BRITT.
[ct=1862.807] HERE IT IS.
[ct=1865.455] RIGHT THERE.
[ct=1873.364] KIRK: A SHOULDERED THE HEAD.
[ct=1874.620] THIS WAS THE PREVIOUS PLAY WHERE
[ct=1878.107] LOGAN HALL, AFTER HE THROWS IT
[ct=1880.374] ACTUALLY PULLS BACK.
[ct=1882.023] ANYTIME A QUARTERBACK GOES DOWN
[ct=1884.657] EVERYONE IS ALWAYS LEERY
[ct=1885.502] WONDERING IF A FLAG WILL COME
[ct=1888.305] AL: ESPECIALLY THE HOME CROWD.
[ct=1893.535] TO THE OUTSIDE, ALGIERS PICKS UP
[ct=1895.130] -- ANOTHER FLAG.
[ct=1901.567] WE ARE 17 SECONDS IN.
[ct=1907.987] KIRK:AL HI -- AL HIGH-FIVED ME
[ct=1909.418] AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER
[ct=1911.680] SAYING, ONLY ONE FLAG.
[ct=1917.037] REFEREE: HOLDING, OFFENSE, 10
[ct=1917.433] YARD PENALTY.
[ct=1919.010] IT WILL BE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1921.664] AL: THE CENTER.
[ct=1924.255] KIRK: HIS HANDS ARE FULL
[ct=1924.826] TONIGHT.
[ct=1930.141] AGAINST GAINES AND VITA VEA.
[ct=1934.015] GREG GAINES IS A BACKUP CENTER.
[ct=1939.322] 301 POUNDS.
[ct=1940.762] THEY ARE RUNNING THE OUTSIDE
[ct=1942.082] ZONE AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GET
[ct=1942.709] THESE GUYS TO GOAD LATERALLY.
[ct=1946.852] IT IS EASY TO LOCK UP ON HIM IF
[ct=1947.372] LOSE LEVERAGE.
[ct=1950.663] AL: THAT IS A FIRST DOWN IN 20.
[ct=1954.679] TO THE OUTSIDE QUICKLY.
[ct=1958.043] LOOKING FOR A BLOCK.
[ct=1960.544] AND WORKING HIS WAY IS RAY-RAY
[ct=1961.209] MCCLOUD, SEVEN YEARS IN THE
[ct=1965.186] SAN FRANCISCO AT ONE POINT.
[ct=1966.743] THEY PICKED HIM UP FROM THE
[ct=1966.999] 49ERS.
[ct=1971.749] KIRK: HE HAS BEEN MORE OF A
[ct=1973.719] RETURN MAN, SPECIAL TEAMS GUY.
[ct=1979.368] I KERLEY YARD -- IKE HILLYARD
[ct=1981.990] WAS ADAMANT.
[ct=1983.408] WE HAVE ROBINSON AND TYLER
[ct=1986.609] ALGIERS SO WE NEED THAT POSITION
[ct=1988.507] AND THEY WANTED TO GIVE RAY-RAY
[ct=1989.394] MCCLOUD A CHANCE.
[ct=1993.339] AL: PRESSURE COMING.
[ct=1996.683] END OF THE POCKET.
[ct=1997.025] WIDE OPEN.
[ct=2002.029] HE SECURES THE BALL AT THE 20.
[ct=2007.091] AND THEY GO TO HODGE, HIS FIRST
[ct=2007.374] CATCH OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=2010.604] THEY HAVE ALREADY INVOLVED SIX
[ct=2011.784] DIFFERENT RECEIVERS.
[ct=2014.206] THAT IS A GAIN OF 22.
[ct=2019.586] KIRK: LOGAN HALL -- ONCE AGAIN
[ct=2021.215] THEY ARE PICKING ON THE INTERIOR
[ct=2023.085] OF THE TAMPA BAY DEFENSE WHETHER
[ct=2028.567] WE HAVE SEEN BRITT BACK THERE,
[ct=2029.600] AND OUTSIDE LINEBACKER DROPPING
[ct=2029.898] BACK IN COVERAGE.
[ct=2033.759] THEY ARE TRYING TO GO AFTER THE
[ct=2034.335] INTERIOR FOR THE TAMPA DEFENSE.
[ct=2038.141] AL: THANKS THE TOSS AND THEN
[ct=2038.458] DOES THROW IT.
[ct=2042.747] COMING BACK THIS WAY AND A NICE
[ct=2045.329] TACKLE BUT A IN AT THE END.
[ct=2047.154] ROBINSON MAKES A GRAB.
[ct=2052.523] THE PENALTY MARKER IS AT THE 18
[ct=2056.264] YARD LINE JUST PAST THE LINE OF
[ct=2056.264] SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=2069.823] REFEREE: HOLDING.
[ct=2073.691] OFFENSE, NUMBER EIGHT.
[ct=2075.344] 10 YARD PENALTY.
[ct=2078.029] KIRK: YOU CALLED IT.
[ct=2081.181] THIS IS AFTER THE COMPLETION.
[ct=2083.480] BIJAN ROBINSON WORKS HIS WAY
[ct=2088.490] BACK TOWARDS PITTS AND THAT IS
[ct=2089.089] WHERE HE GRABS A HOLD OF THE
[ct=2091.212] DEFENDER THAT TIME, TYKEE
[ct=2093.789] THAT IS THE ONE THING THAT HURT
[ct=2096.709] ATLANTA LAST WEEK.
[ct=2097.526] THEY WOULD GET INTO PLUS
[ct=2101.689] TERRITORY AND THEN SELF
[ct=2102.264] INFLICTING A LOT OF PENALTIES
[ct=2102.760] WHICH IS WHY THEY DID NOT HAVE
[ct=2105.683] AN OFFENSIVE TOUCHDOWN LAST
[ct=2107.063] WEEK.
[ct=2109.584] PRETTY FLAWLESS THE FIRST FEW
[ct=2109.584] DRIVES.
[ct=2113.276] AL: FIRST AND 20.
[ct=2115.558] THE PASS IS CAUGHT BUT FOR A
[ct=2117.063] SHORT AGAIN.
[ct=2119.729] -- A SHORT GAIN.
[ct=2124.817] MACCALLUM IS ASCENDING TO THE
[ct=2127.877] STARTING ROLE.
[ct=2131.942] KIRK: HE HAS BEEN THERE AS THE
[ct=2135.026] THIRD CORNER BEHIND DAVIS.
[ct=2135.937] HE WORKED HIS WAY INTO THAT
[ct=2135.937] SPOT.
[ct=2140.384] AL: THAT PASS IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=2144.931] IT IS LAMONTE DAVID WHO MAKES
[ct=2147.019] HIS PRESENCE FELT AS HE HAS SO
[ct=2147.651] MANY TIMES OVER 13 SEASONS IN
[ct=2148.137] THE LEAGUE.
[ct=2151.277] BREAKING IT OUT.
[ct=2151.995] THIRD AND 14.
[ct=2156.304] KIRK: IT IS AMAZING TO WATCH HIM
[ct=2157.370] PLAY AT 34 YEARS OLD AND HIS
[ct=2160.404] GREATEST INSTINCT -- AND HIS
[ct=2161.798] GREATEST STRENGTH IS HIS
[ct=2162.304] INSTINCT AND SAVVY.
[ct=2164.067] AND HIS ABILITY TO COVERED.
[ct=2166.996] LOOK AT THE RIGHT HAND AND ARM
[ct=2169.255] EXTEND KNOCK THE BALL AWAY.
[ct=2172.531] USING HIS EYES ON THE
[ct=2172.582] QUARTERBACK TO KNOW WHEN THE
[ct=2172.860] BALL IS COMING.
[ct=2175.465] AL: OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=2181.317] MOONEY IS IN THERE, TOUCHDOWN!
[ct=2189.397] FIRED IN TO TRAFFIC FROM 25
[ct=2192.731] YARDS OUT ON A THIRD AND 14.
[ct=2196.676] AND ATLANTA RETAKES THE LEAD.
[ct=2199.559] KIRK: BECAUSE OF THEIR SUCCESS
[ct=2201.463] THROWING INTO THE MIDDLE, THEY
[ct=2204.157] MOVED MCCOLLUM TO TAKE AWAY THE
[ct=2204.806] POTENTIAL OF ANY RECEIVER THAT
[ct=2207.377] WILL WORK IN THEIR.
[ct=2208.753] YOU HAVE A CORNER WORKING IN
[ct=2210.516] THEIR.
[ct=2212.337] BY THE TIME HE TURNS AROUND
[ct=2214.728] BECAUSE COUSINS THREW IT ON THE
[ct=2216.133] LINE HE DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO
[ct=2218.345] ADJUST TO THE BALL AND TALK
[ct=2219.576] ABOUT ADJUSTMENT, WHAT A JOB BY
[ct=2220.323] DARNELL MOONEY TO MAKE THAT
[ct=2222.883] CATCH UP IN THE AIR.
[ct=2230.292] AL: AND THEY GO "KOO" FOR THE
[ct=2231.296] EXTRA POINT.
[ct=2233.336] COUSINS HAS ALREADY THROWN FOR
[ct=2235.385] 176 YARDS
[ct=2236.536] AL: THE SEASON FINALE OF THE
[ct=2240.508] LORD OF THE RINGS: RINGS OF
[ct=2240.763] POWER PREMIERING TONIGHT ONLY ON
[ct=2240.763] CRIME.
[ct=2245.869] STAY TUNED FOR THE CONCLUSION OF
[ct=2247.485] ONE OF THE BEST TV SHOWS OF THE
[ct=2252.036] SPEAKING OF RINGS, THE OLYMPIC
[ct=2252.036] RINGS.
[ct=2254.875] CHECKING OUT LONDON ON THE
[ct=2258.454] DRAKE LONDON BEING CHECKED OUT
[ct=2263.709] ON THE ATLANTA BENCH.
[ct=2263.929] HE JOGS BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM.
[ct=2269.476] THIS IS A LINE DRIVE KICK THAT
[ct=2272.154] WILL BE RETURNED FROM THE 4 YARD
[ct=2272.154] LINE.
[ct=2275.408] TUCKER WORKS HIS WAY OUT PAST
[ct=2276.640] THE 30.
[ct=2280.218] HE IS STILL ON HIS FEET.
[ct=2282.762] THERE HE GOES AND FINALLY
[ct=2283.138] TACKLED BY THE LAST MAN THAT CAN
[ct=2283.138] GET HIM.
[ct=2288.994] SEAN TUCKER, SECOND YEAR GUY OUT
[ct=2291.030] OF SYRACUSE AND MIKE ABERNATHY,
[ct=2291.922] THE LAST GUY DOWN THERE WAS ABLE
[ct=2294.443] TO SAVE IT AT THE ATLANTA 44
[ct=2298.254] KIRK: THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN
[ct=2298.939] WAITING FOR.
[ct=2302.746] EVERY TIME YOU WATCH AND NFL
[ct=2302.947] GAME YOU WANT TO SEE A BIG
[ct=2303.395] RETURN.
[ct=2308.894] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 MS. TACKLES AND
[ct=2312.776] GOOD HARD RUNNING BY THE BACK
[ct=2313.864] OUT OF SYRACUSE IN HIS SECOND
[ct=2318.524] AL: HE RAN INTO A COUPLE OF HIS
[ct=2318.820] OWN GUYS OVER THERE.
[ct=2323.351] HERE IS MAYFIELD THROWING ON THE
[ct=2324.159] RUN.
[ct=2327.328] CAUGHT AT THE 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=2330.779] BREAKING TACKLES ALL OVER THE
[ct=2331.014] PLACE.
[ct=2334.353] INSIDE THE 25 HE GOES FOR A GAIN
[ct=2335.529] OF 22.
[ct=2339.307] KIRK: AND THIS WAS THE BAKER
[ct=2341.604] MAYFIELD AND OFFENSE LAST WEEK
[ct=2341.604] AGAINST PHILLY.
[ct=2344.404] A LOT OF LEVELS CONCEPTS HERE.
[ct=2347.321] GET THE BALL OUT, GET IT TO
[ct=2348.599] OTTEN.
[ct=2352.288] A BIG GUY.
[ct=2354.131] HE SHOWS HIS LENGTH TO BE ABLE
[ct=2356.067] TO MAKE THE CATCH AND THEN HE
[ct=2356.416] DOES NOT GO OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=2360.963] AL: MAYFIELD, A GAIN OF 11.
[ct=2364.150] OTTEN SCORED TWO.
[ct=2371.734] AND STUFFED IT AT THE LINE OF
[ct=2375.918] SCRIMMAGE IS ROCHON WHITE BY
[ct=2376.643] SMITH WILLIAMS.
[ct=2379.606] KIRK: THEY ARE TRYING TO GET THE
[ct=2381.322] RUNNING GAME GOING.
[ct=2382.459] YOU MENTIONED IT EARLY IN THE
[ct=2384.973] GAME AND WITHOUT THEIR RIGHT
[ct=2391.853] TACKLE, GOEDEKE, IT HAS BEEN
[ct=2391.853] HARD TO GET IT GOING.
[ct=2398.728] LOOK AT THAT, LAST 22, 23, 24,
[ct=2398.989] IT HAS BEEN TOUGH AND THIS
[ct=2403.569] OFFENSIVE LINE IS BUILT TO BE
[ct=2404.537] BETTER AT PASS PROTECTING THEN
[ct=2406.334] DRIVING PEOPLE OFF THE BALL.
[ct=2408.183] THEY WANT TO TRY TO EMPHASIZE IT
[ct=2410.276] AND MAKE SOMETHING TEAMS HAVE TO
[ct=2410.276] RESPECT.
[ct=2415.525] AL: WIDE OPEN! EVANS, TOUCHDOWN!
[ct=2427.256] 23 YARDS -- IT IS THE 100TH
[ct=2430.800] TOUCHDOWN OF HIS CAREER ON 99
[ct=2431.101] RECEPTIONS.
[ct=2436.219] KIRK: BAKER LOVES THAT THROW --
[ct=2438.714] ANY TIME HE CAN GET THE CORNER
[ct=2438.994] ROUTE ESPECIALLY TO HIS GUY
[ct=2439.383] EVANS.
[ct=2441.990] HE IS READING THE SAFETY AND NOW
[ct=2444.223] HE HAS THE ONE-ON-ONE
[ct=2444.465] OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=2447.455] THAT IS A MISMATCH AGAINST THE
[ct=2447.754] BACKUP NICKEL.
[ct=2451.016] WHAT A TOUGH ASK FOR HAMILTON TO
[ct=2453.248] BE ABLE TO STAY WITH MIKE EVANS
[ct=2453.576] ON THAT OUTSIDE ROUTE.
[ct=2459.146] AL: 99 RECEIVING TOUCHDOWNS AND
[ct=2459.696] ONE FUMBLE RECOVERY SO THERE IS
[ct=2462.174] THE 100TH FOR EVANS.
[ct=2467.615] EVANS WITH THE SECOND TOUCHDOWN
[ct=2469.974] PASS OF THE NIGHT FROM BAKER
[ct=2472.073] A 53 YARD KICKOFF RETURN STARTED
[ct=2473.045] IT.
[ct=2475.711] AND HE GIV
[ct=2481.739] AL: ONE WEEK FROM TONIGHT ON
[ct=2483.021] THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, OFF WE
[ct=2486.545] GO TO THE WEST COAST TO SEATTLE.
[ct=2489.073] THE SEAHAWKS AND THE 49ERS ON
[ct=2489.892] THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL FOR WHAT
[ct=2491.602] HAS BECOME ONE OF THE GREAT
[ct=2492.728] RIVALRIES IN THE NFL.
[ct=2498.083] SAN FRANCISCO AND SEATTLE NEXT
[ct=2503.538] 17-14, TAMPA BAY IS ON TOP.
[ct=2509.074] TRENTON GILL SENDS IT SKYWARD.
[ct=2510.259] FIVE YARDS INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=2511.489] A TOUCHBACK.
[ct=2515.200] KAYLEE: MIKE EVANS KEEPS GIVING
[ct=2517.433] AWAY PIECES OF BUCS HISTORY TO
[ct=2521.423] GUYS WEARING 13 -- NUMBER 13
[ct=2523.049] JERSEYS.
[ct=2526.163] HE SAID HE DID NOT THINK ABOUT
[ct=2527.176] KEEPING THAT LAST ONE BECAUSE HE
[ct=2531.454] IS ONLY THINKING ABOUT GETTING
[ct=2534.336] AND KEEPING THE 100TH BALL.
[ct=2536.866] THAT IS HIS 100TH TOUCHDOWN BUT
[ct=2538.157] HE HAS HIS EYE ON A CAREER
[ct=2539.743] MILESTONE FOR THE
[ct=2541.074] TOUCHDOWN CATCH.
[ct=2543.532] THE NEXT BALL IS THE ONE HE'S
[ct=2543.870] GOING TO KEEP.
[ct=2545.094] WE HOPE.
[ct=2548.857] KIRK: GO DOWN AND TAPPED HIM ON
[ct=2549.533] THE SHOULDER AND REMIND HIM.
[ct=2552.207] AL: AND WHAT ABOUT THE FUMBLE
[ct=2552.207] RECOVERY?
[ct=2560.379] YOU KEEP THROWING. DURING THE
[ct=2560.874] COMMERCIAL WE WERE WATCHING THE
[ct=2563.777] GUYS THROWING THE BALL AROUND
[ct=2565.174] AND THAT BALL IS GOING TO BE ON
[ct=2567.170] EBAY.
[ct=2570.427] KIRK: I CANNOT BELIEVE IT CAME
[ct=2571.596] BACK TO THE ORIGINAL OWNER.
[ct=2573.483] HE IS FIRED UP.
[ct=2577.648] I'VE NEVER SEEN A GUY SO EXCITED
[ct=2579.265] ABOUT GETTING A FOOTBALL.
[ct=2581.309] HE IS READY TO GO.
[ct=2582.472] LET'S SEE IF THE DEFENSE CAN
[ct=2584.714] MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS AND GET
[ct=2586.708] THE QUARTERBACKS OUT OF RHYTHM.
[ct=2587.835] BOTH OF THESE GUYS ARE PLAYING
[ct=2588.125] GREAT FOOTBALL.
[ct=2596.400] AL: GOOD PROTECTION.
[ct=2599.639] OPEN, THE CATCH IS MADE.
[ct=2601.793] OFF TO THE RACES.
[ct=2605.658] A GAIN OF 19 FOR THE TIGHT END.
[ct=2609.489] HE HAS TWO CATCHES AND 50 YARDS.
[ct=2613.508] KIRK: THEY MOVED HIM FROM
[ct=2613.508] IN-LINE TO OUT WIDE BEFORE THE
[ct=2613.736] SNAP.
[ct=2617.815] IT IS ZONE SO HE GETS UNDERNEATH
[ct=2617.815] HIM.
[ct=2622.217] AT 6'6" IT IS NOT HARD TO
[ct=2624.816] GOOD HARD THROW GIVES HIM A
[ct=2626.247] CHANCE TO GET BETWEEN THE
[ct=2627.156] LINEBACKER AND THE SAFETY AFTER
[ct=2627.487] THE CATCH.
[ct=2629.923] IT IS GREAT TO SEE NUMBER EIGHT
[ct=2631.204] GET HIS HANDS ON THE FOOTBALL
[ct=2632.104] FOR ATLANTA.
[ct=2639.013] AL: NOTHING HAPPENING HERE BUT
[ct=2641.401] THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, BREAKING
[ct=2642.232] TACKLES AGAIN IS BIJAN ROBINSON
[ct=2647.619] WHO TURNS NO GAIN
[ct=2650.717] YARDS.
[ct=2655.007] KIRK: HE IS LOCKING HIM UP AND
[ct=2656.950] HAS HIM DOWN BUT IT GIVES YOU AN
[ct=2657.802] IDEA OF HOW TOUGH AND PHYSICAL
[ct=2660.626] BIJAN ROBINSON IS.
[ct=2663.574] AL: SECOND AND FOUR.
[ct=2666.154] FIRED.
[ct=2668.520] BLOOD IS GOING TO BE HAULED --
[ct=2672.186] THAT IS GOING TO BE HAULED IN AT
[ct=2675.696] THE 38 YARD LINE.
[ct=2675.958] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2678.886] KIRK: IT IS REALLY NICE TO SEE
[ct=2681.431] COZZENS GET HIM THE BALL --
[ct=2686.345] COUSINS GET HIM THE BALL.
[ct=2688.084] HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIS THIRD OR
[ct=2688.389] FOURTH OPTION.
[ct=2690.946] HE CAME BACK TO GET
[ct=2696.507] THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD WHERE HE
[ct=2697.520] IS FEASTING ON THE DEFENSE AND
[ct=2700.610] HE IS NOW 10 OF 11.
[ct=2700.610] IT IS EARLY IN THE GAME.
[ct=2705.202] 156 YARDS AND TWO TOUCHDOWNS IN
[ct=2705.955] THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD.
[ct=2710.901] AL: 202 YARDS IN A QUARTER AND A
[ct=2712.051] HALF FOR COUSINS.
[ct=2715.731] THE BALL IS LOOSE.
[ct=2716.857] THERE IS A SCRAMBLE FOR IT.
[ct=2720.146] JORDAN WHITEHEAD COMES IN.
[ct=2723.106] BUCS SAY THEY HAVE IT AND THERE
[ct=2723.106] IS A FLAG.
[ct=2727.659] KIRK: INTENTIONAL GROUNDING.
[ct=2729.461] HE GOT THE BALL OUT BUT WAS
[ct=2732.001] THROWING IT TO NOBODY.
[ct=2733.967] I THINK HE WAS WILLING TO TAKE
[ct=2735.311] THE INTENTIONAL GROUNDING TO
[ct=2735.610] AVOID GETTING THE BALL KNOCKED
[ct=2736.922] LOOSE.
[ct=2744.505] AL: THAT WAS A FIRST END 10.
[ct=2747.298] REFEREE: THE RULING ON THE FIELD
[ct=2750.134] IS THAT THE QUARTERBACK THREW A
[ct=2751.684] FORWARD PASS BUT THERE WAS NO
[ct=2752.032] RECEIVER IN THE AREA.
[ct=2755.535] IT IS INTENTIONAL GROUNDING BY
[ct=2758.460] THE OFFENSE, NUMBER 18.
[ct=2758.837] A10 YARD PENALTY.
[ct=2760.039] LOSS OF A DOWN.
[ct=2765.671] KIRK: THE LAST DRIVE THEY HAD
[ct=2766.546] THEY OVERCAME SOME PENALTIES AND
[ct=2768.196] THERE WAS A FIRST DOWN 20.
[ct=2770.576] WATCH THE RIGHT HAND.
[ct=2773.544] HE FLIPS IT.
[ct=2776.159] HE KNEW WHAT IT WOULD COST HIM
[ct=2777.402] BUT HE DID NOT WANT THE
[ct=2777.970] POTENTIAL OF LOSING THE FOOTBALL
[ct=2778.766] SO HE GOT RID OF IT.
[ct=2781.851] AL: MAKING SURE THE ARM COMES
[ct=2786.273] IT MAKES IT SECOND DOWN AND 20.
[ct=2789.511] AND A STOPPAGE HERE.
[ct=2795.798] A TAMPA CHALLENGE ON THAT PLAY.
[ct=2797.754] TAMPA WILL NOW PROBABLY
[ct=2802.223] CHALLENGE AND CONTEND THAT IT
[ct=2802.663] WAS A FUMBLE.
[ct=2807.709] REFEREE: TAMPA BAY HAS
[ct=2808.191] CHALLENGED THE RULING ON THE
[ct=2811.371] FIELD WITH THE QUARTERBACKS
[ct=2812.743] FORWARD PASS AND THE PREVIOUS
[ct=2813.204] PLAY IS UNDER REVIEW.
[ct=2814.728] TIMEOUT ON THE FIELD.
[ct=2817.911] KIRK: ATLANTA RECOVERED IT SO IF
[ct=2821.152] IT IS A FUMBLE, THE FALCONS GOT
[ct=2821.396] ON TOP OF THE BALL.
[ct=2823.451] AL: EXACTLY.
[ct=2834.375] REFEREE: AFTER REVIEWING THE
[ct=2835.252] PLAY, THE RULING STANDS AS
[ct=2835.252] CALLED.
[ct=2838.408] TAMPA WILL BE CHARGED.
[ct=2842.981] KIRK: IT IS VERY CLEAR YOU COULD
[ct=2845.427] SEE THE RIGHT HAND COMING
[ct=2848.869] WE SAID HE WAS GETTING RID OF
[ct=2849.180] THE BALL UNDERSTANDING HE WOULD
[ct=2851.300] GET THE FLAG ANYWAYS.
[ct=2856.911] AL: DRAKE LONDON COMES BACK FROM
[ct=2857.518] THE LOCKER ROOM.
[ct=2864.612] ROBINSON TAKES IT TO THE 40 YARD
[ct=2868.805] KAYLEE: DRAKE LUND AND HAS BEEN
[ct=2869.607] CLEARED TO GO BACK INTO THE GAME
[ct=2872.392] AFTER BEING EVALUATED FOR A
[ct=2873.313] CONCUSSION.
[ct=2878.349] YOU SAW THAT VIDEO EARLIER WHERE
[ct=2879.628] DRAKE WAS GRABBED ON THE
[ct=2881.221] SIDELINE AND TAKEN TO THE LOCKER
[ct=2881.221] ROOM.
[ct=2886.794] THE FALCONS DEFENSIVE BACK HAS
[ct=2887.047] BEEN RULED OUT BECAUSE HE DOES
[ct=2887.792] HAVE A CONCUSSION.
[ct=2890.605] AL: TYKEE SMITH WAS HEARD ON THE
[ct=2893.472] LAST PLAY, THE ROOKIE THIRD
[ct=2895.790] ROUND PICK OUT OF GEORGIA.
[ct=2898.620] HE NEEDS THE ATTENTION BEFORE
[ct=2899.839] THIRD DOWN AND 14 WHEN PLAY
[ct=2906.648] KIRK: I THINK HE FELT HIS OWN
[ct=2910.052] PLAYER, K.J. BRITT WHO WAS
[ct=2912.843] RUNNING AND CHASING THE BALL AND
[ct=2913.589] ENDED UP HITTING HIS OWN MAN.
[ct=2916.142] JUST TOWARDS THE END OF THE
[ct=2916.332] PLAY.
[ct=2919.698] IT IS GOOD TO SEE HIM UP.
[ct=2923.670] K.J. BRITT BRINGS IT.
[ct=2927.764] 52, RIGHT THERE WITH THE HELMET
[ct=2930.126] BUT SMITH IS UP AND OFF TO THE
[ct=2940.323] AL: HE GOES BACK TO THE BENCH.
[ct=2944.779] THEY ARE ALREADY MINUS ANTOINE
[ct=2948.383] WINFIELD WHO HAS BEEN OUT WITH
[ct=2949.827] THE LAST -- FOR THE LAST THREE
[ct=2951.242] WEEKS WITH A FOOT INJURY.
[ct=2955.171] THOMAS COMES IN ON A THIRD AND
[ct=2957.923] 14 FROM THE 42.
[ct=2961.884] IN THE POCKET.
[ct=2964.507] HE FLARES IT OUT.
[ct=2969.892] DOWN YEAR'S -- -- ALGIERS AND HE
[ct=2975.196] GETS TAKEN OUT AT THE 36 BY
[ct=2977.529] LAMONTE DAVID.
[ct=2978.914] FOURTH DOWN AND IT LOOKS LIKE
[ct=2982.929] KOO IS GOING TO COME IN AFTER HE
[ct=2985.517] MISSED A 41 YARDER EARLIER.
[ct=2992.260] IF YOUR NAME IS KOO, YOU DON'T
[ct=2993.506] KNOW IF THEY ARE CHANTING YOUR
[ct=2996.355] NAME OR, MISSING A 41 YARD FIELD
[ct=2997.653] GOAL --
[ct=3001.511] KIRK: IT IS TOUGH.
[ct=3002.844] I'M FEELING THIS ONE.
[ct=3002.844] HE IS GOING TO HIT THIS.
[ct=3005.489] AL: 54?
[ct=3013.465] AND -- YOU FELT IT RIGHT.
[ct=3013.465] INSIDE THE LEFT UPRIGHT.
[ct=3018.863] 50 YARD FIELD GOALS IN THE NFL
[ct=3021.446] ARE A DIME A DOZEN THIS YEAR.
[ct=3029.406] 6:17 TO THE HALF AND WE ARE
[ct=3030.762] LOCKED AT 17-17.
[ct=3033.380] KIRK: HE JUST NEEDED TO MOVE
[ct=3034.729] BACK A LITTLE BIT TO FEEL MORE
[ct=3034.729] COMFORTABLE.
[ct=3038.693] AL: LIKE LAST WEEK IN DALLAS.
[ct=3041.358] KIRK: I WATCH THESE KICKERS
[ct=3046.687] WARMING UP FROM 50 LIKE IT IS 35
[ct=3047.970] AND I'M ALWAYS ENAMORED HOW
[ct=3050.681] THESE GUYS ARE HANGING THESE 55
[ct=3051.952] AND 60 YARDS.
[ct=3059.949] AL: WE DID NOT KNOW THIS OR SEE
[ct=3059.949] THIS.
[ct=3063.940] THIS IS KAYLEE HARTUNG, LADIES
[ct=3066.598] AND GENTLEMEN ABOUT A WEEK AGO.
[ct=3069.273] KIRK: SHE IS CRAZY.
[ct=3071.875] AL: WE KNEW THAT ALREADY.
[ct=3075.896] KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE SHE IS
[ct=3075.896] ENJOYING HERSELF
[ct=3077.207] YOU ARE CRAZY.
[ct=3079.844] KAYLEE: IT WAS A BLAST.
[ct=3082.559] WIND AND DONE -- THAT IS GOOD
[ct=3085.199] ENOUGH FOR ME.
[ct=3086.487] THERE MIGHT'VE BEEN DISCUSSION
[ct=3087.827] ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT I WOULD TRY
[ct=3090.522] THAT TONIGHT LIVE.
[ct=3091.792] LET'S ROLL THE TAPE AND GET AS
[ct=3094.439] MUCH BANG FOR OUR BUCK AS WE
[ct=3094.439] CAN.
[ct=3098.467] IT IS A LITTLE CRAZY LOOKING UP
[ct=3099.845] AT IT DOWN HERE TONIGHT.
[ct=3103.777] KIRK: AND THEY SAID AL'S
[ct=3105.122] NEXT WEEK.
[ct=3107.784] AL: AL JEROME.
[ct=3117.107] KAYLEE DID NOT EVEN GET ANY
[ct=3117.107] LESSONS FROM TOM CRUISE.
[ct=3121.056] THIS WAS TWO YEARS AGO ON A
[ct=3123.696] BAKER MAYFIELD FLIES INTO LOS
[ct=3126.381] ANGELES ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON.
[ct=3127.700] HE IS WITH SEAN MCVAY.
[ct=3131.701] FOR 48 HOURS.
[ct=3133.013] NO SLEEP.
[ct=3134.301] HE LEARNS THE PLAYBOOK AND COMES
[ct=3137.020] END OF THE GAME AND LEADS THEM
[ct=3138.329] ON THE 98 YARD DRIVE AT THE END
[ct=3138.329] OF THE GAME TO WIN IT.
[ct=3142.268] KIRK: NO TIMEOUTS, HE HAD BEEN
[ct=3144.975] THERE FOR TWO DAYS -- HOW THE
[ct=3146.261] HECK DID THAT HAPPEN?
[ct=3148.945] AL: HE KNEW THE PLAYBOOK AS WELL
[ct=3150.232] AS HE NEEDED TO.
[ct=3155.607] AND BEFORE THE GAME TONIGHT, HE
[ct=3156.924] WAS GETTING HIMSELF ALL HEPPED
[ct=3160.926] UP BY LOOKING A
[ct=3162.216] VIDEOS IN HIS LOCKER.
[ct=3164.831] KIRK: NAME A QUARTERBACK IN THE
[ct=3168.918] NFL THAT TO GET HIS MIND RIGHT
[ct=3171.511] WOULD WATCH MIKE TYSON.
[ct=3174.161] I COULD UNDERSTAND A SAFETY OR A
[ct=3175.486] PASS RUSHER BUT THIS IS A
[ct=3176.789] QUARTERBACK AND IT TELLS YOU HOW
[ct=3178.175] HE PLAYS THE GAME.
[ct=3180.777] AL: HE WAS HEADBUTTING GUYS AT
[ct=3184.767] CAROLINA WITH THEIR HELMETS AND
[ct=3184.767] HIS BARE HEAD.
[ct=3187.453] FIRST DOWN FROM THE 29 YARD
[ct=3194.075] WHITE, STILL MOVING!
[ct=3198.087] WHITE, INSIDE THE 30 AND TAKEN
[ct=3202.054] DOWN AT THE 10 YARD LINE BY
[ct=3203.436] TERRELL.
[ct=3207.396] HE EXPLODES FOR 56.
[ct=3210.047] KIRK: ABLE TO RUN THE
[ct=3214.012] COUNTERPLAY, THE PLAYS SIDE HAS
[ct=3215.392] TO DO A GOOD JOB OF ESTABLISHING
[ct=3216.644] THAT TO OPEN UP THE GUARD AND
[ct=3218.013] COME AROUND.
[ct=3220.637] ATHLETIC AS HECK.
[ct=3221.988] HE GETS A NICE BLOCK.
[ct=3225.999] AND EDDIE MAKE SIMMONS,
[ct=3227.277] MISSES.
[ct=3228.635] THIS IS WHAT TAMPA BAY FANS HAVE
[ct=3229.958] BEEN WAITING TO SEE OUT OF
[ct=3229.958] WHITE.
[ct=3236.605] AL: HELMET TO HELMET.
[ct=3237.958] FROM THE 15.
[ct=3239.233] THE TOSS.
[ct=3241.929] NICE MOVE.
[ct=3245.894] TO THE 5 GOES BUCKY IRVING.
[ct=3245.894] HE IS TAKEN DOWN
[ct=3248.537] WILLIAMS.
[ct=3252.544] KIRK: LOOK AT THE PIECES.
[ct=3253.881] IT IS NOT JUST MY GAVIN OR CHRIS
[ct=3256.807] BODDEN -- CHRIS GODWIN.
[ct=3262.112] THEY HAVE PIECES AND THEN
[ct=3263.508] THROW BAKER MAYFIELD INTO THE
[ct=3264.771] MIX AND WHAT HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO
[ct=3266.140] DO AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO
[ct=3270.144] DISTRIBUTE THE BALL AND NOT LOCK
[ct=3270.144] INTO JUST ONE GUY.
[ct=3272.735] IT IS A LOT TO DEAL WITH IN THIS
[ct=3278.085] LEAGUE: OFFENSIVE -- LIAM COHEN
[ct=3283.415] 'S OFFENSIVE STRATEGY THIS YEAR.
[ct=3287.385] AL: A HARD TO HIT THEIR
[ct=3288.667] IRVING FROM GETTING INTO THE END
[ct=3288.667] ZONE.
[ct=3291.383] THIS TEAM HAS A TON OF TALENT.
[ct=3295.373] A GOOD VETERAN MIX WITH A LOT OF
[ct=3296.638] GOOD YOUNG PLAYERS WITH BAKER
[ct=3298.013] MAYFIELD P
[ct=3299.342] HIS GAME NOW.
[ct=3302.049] KIRK: AND I THINK BAKER
[ct=3306.001] MAYFIELD, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
[ct=3307.422] FUN WITH THE MIKE TYSON END THE
[ct=3308.790] HEADBUTTING IN CAROLINA BUT I
[ct=3311.322] THINK HE IS A DEFERENT --
[ct=3313.959] DIFFERENT GUY FROM THE ONE IN
[ct=3315.290] L.A.
[ct=3319.238] NOW HE HAS BECOME MORE OF A
[ct=3320.611] VETERAN THAT THEY COUNT ON FOR
[ct=3320.611] LEADERSHIP AND GUIDANCE.
[ct=3324.629] AL: FROM THE 2.
[ct=3326.020] DID HE GET IN?
[ct=3328.610] HE CANNOT.
[ct=3332.598] IRVING IS STUFFED AT THE 1
[ct=3335.265] A SECOND DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=3339.224] JUST OVER THREE MINUTES TO PLAY.
[ct=3343.389] KIRK: THIS DEFENSIVE LINE, THEY
[ct=3346.042] DON'T HAVE THE GAME WRECKERS
[ct=3347.240] UPFRONT.
[ct=3351.204] THAT IS WHY IT IS TOUGH TO RUN
[ct=3353.943] THE INTERIOR WITH THE FRONT
[ct=3355.354] THREE THEY HAVE WITH THEIR SIZE.
[ct=3358.535] AL: SECOND DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=3364.427] KIRK: BAKER IS ALWAYS A THREAT.
[ct=3365.796] HE CAN RUN THE BALL HIMSELF.
[ct=3372.402] WHITE GETS TACKLED AT
[ct=3374.337] THE 4-YARD LINE BY CLARK
[ct=3374.908] PHILLIPS.
[ct=3375.544] THAT SAVES A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=3376.229] THIRD AND GOAL.
[ct=3381.970] PHILLIPS DOES A NICE JOB
[ct=3383.661] COMING OFF OF GODWIN.
[ct=3384.848] HE WAS OUT THERE GIVES
[ct=3386.374] UP ON GODWIN.
[ct=3387.968] GREAT AWARENESS THAT
[ct=3389.668] TIME NOT TO BE LURED
[ct=3390.147] INTO THE INSIDE.
[ct=3391.507] THOSE THREE RECEIVERS
[ct=3392.338] WERE STACKED UP TO THE
[ct=3392.970] OUTSIDE.
[ct=3393.548] THEY ALL WENT TO THE
[ct=3393.886] INSIDE.
[ct=3395.332] WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY FOR
[ct=3397.475] PHILLIPS TO FOLLOW
[ct=3397.475] THEM.
[ct=3399.205] INSTEAD, EYES ON BAKER
[ct=3400.651] MAYFIELD COMES OFF OF
[ct=3401.996] HE’S IN GREAT POSITION
[ct=3403.256] TO MAKE THAT TACKLE.
[ct=3407.110] AL: TO THE TWO-MINUTE
[ct=3408.424] WARNING ON "THURSDAY
[ct=3409.225] NIGHT FOOTBALL."
[ct=3410.375] TAMPA BAY 17, ATLANTA
[ct=3412.558] 17.WHILE, BIG PLAY
[ct=3413.522] HERE, THIRD DOWN AND
[ct=3413.934] GOAL.
[ct=3415.586] FROM THE 3-YARD LINE.
[ct=3422.903] RUNNING BACK IS WHITE.
[ct=3424.034] SPLIT LEFT.
[ct=3426.358] GODWIN TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=3431.108] THROWS TO THE CORNER,
[ct=3431.108] THAT’S CAUGHT.
[ct=3433.799] STERLING SHEPHERD COMES
[ct=3434.136] UP WITH IT.
[ct=3436.362] SO THE TWO GUYS WHO
[ct=3437.884] CONNECTED IN OKLAHOMA
[ct=3440.222] YEARS AGO, SHEPHERD OFF
[ct=3441.380] THE PRACTICE SQUAD, A
[ct=3442.266] COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.
[ct=3444.275] PULLS IT IN FOR THE
[ct=3444.648] TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=3445.687] TAMPA BAY TAKES THE LEAD
[ct=3446.159] AGAIN.
[ct=3450.646] KIRK: WOW, WAS THAT A
[ct=3450.808] TROPE?
[ct=3452.887] TALK ABOUT THE CHEMISTRY
[ct=3454.987] GOING BACK TO 2015 IN
[ct=3455.203] NORMAN, OKLAHOMA.
[ct=3456.959] HE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE HE
[ct=3458.332] WANTED TO GO WITH THIS
[ct=3460.103] A DRAKE ROUTE BY
[ct=3461.712] SHEPHERD, PUTS RIGHT ON
[ct=3462.476] THE MONEY.
[ct=3463.521] WASN’T BAD COVERAGE AT
[ct=3464.109] ALL.
[ct=3465.852] HAMILTON PRETTY CLOSE IN
[ct=3466.353] COVERAGE.
[ct=3467.293] HE DIDN’T HAVE MUCH ROOM
[ct=3468.641] TO GET THAT IN THERE.
[ct=3470.341] BUT HE SOMEHOW THREADED
[ct=3470.770] THE NEEDLE.
[ct=3480.293] LIP MCLAUGHLIN TACKS ON
[ct=3480.719] ANOTHER ONE.
[ct=3486.668] KIRK: HE KNOWS EXACTLY
[ct=3487.638] WHERE HE WANTS TO GO,
[ct=3488.911] BACK TO THAT CORNER.
[ct=3490.215] BEFORE HE RELEASES THE
[ct=3491.540] BALL, LOOK THAIT
[ct=3491.540] COVERAGE HERE.
[ct=3492.925] THAT’S PRETTY TIGHT.
[ct=3494.221] LOOK WHERE HE PUTS THE
[ct=3494.221] BALL.
[ct=3496.849] THAT’S AN OUTSTANDING
[ct=3498.287] THROW BY BAKER
[ct=3500.607] YOU SEE SHEPHERD WORK
[ct=3502.630] INSIDE, KIND OF
[ct=3502.630] HESITATE.
[ct=3503.946] PICKS UP, SWITCH OF
[ct=3505.345] COVERAGE, THEN GETS AWAY
[ct=3506.607] FROM HAMILTON THERE WITH
[ct=3507.907] AN OUTSTANDING THROW.
[ct=3509.122] AGAIN, THAT’S A GREAT
[ct=3510.922] LOOK AT IT RIGHT THERE.
[ct=3512.269] HE COULD NOT HAVE HANDED
[ct=3513.560] THAT FOOTBALL ANY BETTER
[ct=3516.065] TEAMMATE.
[ct=3524.100] AL: WE’VE HAD A FEW
[ct=3525.191] BLOWOUTS ON THURSDAY
[ct=3526.493] NIGHT BUT THIS IS A
[ct=3526.493] BEAUTY SO FAR.
[ct=3529.283] KIRK: THIS IS GREAT.
[ct=3529.283] WHAT A WAY TO START THE
[ct=3530.548] WEEKEND IN FOOTBALL.
[ct=3531.577] AL: WEEK FIVE, FIRST
[ct=3532.563] GAME OF OCTOBER.
[ct=3537.458] COUPLE OF YEARS AGO,
[ct=3538.516] SHEPHERD THOUGHT HIS
[ct=3538.972] CAREER WAS OVER.
[ct=3545.699] MAYFIELD AS HAPPY AS
[ct=3546.564] HE’S EVER BEEN.
[ct=3547.928] HE INDICATED THAT THE
[ct=3549.330] OTHER DAY IN OUR ZOOM
[ct=3549.649] CALL.
[ct=3551.014] KICKOFF HERE WILL GO
[ct=3552.287] THROUGH THE END ZONE FOR
[ct=3557.668] KIRK: BAKER HAS BEEN ON
[ct=3559.222] FIRE DOING A REALLY GOOD
[ct=3559.451] JOB.
[ct=3561.949] HE’S 12-15.
[ct=3563.912] WHAT I LIKE IS TALKING
[ct=3564.768] ABOUT HIM BEING DECISIVE
[ct=3566.042] LAST WEEK AGAINST
[ct=3566.440] PHILLY.
[ct=3568.788] DIELG UP PLAY, GETTING
[ct=3569.967] HIM A CHANCE TO GET THE
[ct=3571.612] BALL, AND HE’S MIXING IT
[ct=3574.214] IT’S MIKE EVANS, CHRIS
[ct=3576.638] GODWIN, WE SAW SHEPHERD
[ct=3578.008] MAKE A NICE TOUCHDOWN
[ct=3579.808] WITH A PERFECTLY THROWN
[ct=3581.808] SO HE WAS IN THE ZONE A
[ct=3584.172] WEEK AGO AND THAT HAS
[ct=3586.449] CONTINUED, WHICH IS --
[ct=3587.977] WHICH THEY WANT TO SEE,
[ct=3588.904] CONSISTENCY WEEK IN AND
[ct=3589.513] WEEK OUT.
[ct=3591.188] A GREAT FIRST HALF SO
[ct=3591.567] FAR FROM TAMPA.
[ct=3595.612] AL: COUSINS HAS BEEN AS
[ct=3597.182] HOT AS MAYFIELD.
[ct=3599.530] THAT’S OVER THE MIDDLE
[ct=3600.971] FOR RAYRAY MCCLOUD.
[ct=3607.906] KIRK: IMPORTANT MINUTE
[ct=3610.016] 51 FOR ATLANTA, DOWN
[ct=3610.265] SEVEN.
[ct=3611.584] THEY’VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO
[ct=3612.627] STOP BAKER IN THIS
[ct=3613.222] OFFENSE.
[ct=3615.843] BUCS HAVE THREE
[ct=3616.838] TOUCHDOWN DRIVES AN A
[ct=3617.797] FIELD GOAL, THEY HAVE
[ct=3618.891] MOVED THE BALL AT WAS.
[ct=3623.787] AL: KEAMP WILL GET THE
[ct=3624.786] BALL TO START THE SECOND
[ct=3625.309] HALF.
[ct=3628.327] COUSINS FIRES.
[ct=3629.969] CAUGHT A LITTLE SHORT OF
[ct=3631.185] THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3632.761] WAS HIS KNEE DOWN?
[ct=3633.853] THAT’S THE QUESTION.
[ct=3635.628] DRAKE LONDON TAKING THE
[ct=3636.043] CATCH.
[ct=3637.875] THEY GIVE HIM THE FIRST
[ct=3639.809] DOWN AS HE CROSSES THE
[ct=3639.809] 40-YARD LINE.
[ct=3644.887] KIRK: HECK OF AN EFFORT
[ct=3646.364] JUST SHORT OF THE FIRST
[ct=3647.953] DOWN THE BALL BROUGHT
[ct=3648.190] HIM BACK.
[ct=3649.186] MIGHT BE A YARD SHORT
[ct=3650.589] BUT HIS KNEE DID NOT
[ct=3650.968] TOUCH.
[ct=3654.693] AL: THEY’RE GOING TO
[ct=3655.064] REVIEW IT.
[ct=3656.334] NO COACHES’ CHALLENGES
[ct=3657.098] IN THE LAST TWO
[ct=3657.443] MINUTES.
[ct=3661.582] WAS ANYTHING HIT?
[ct=3662.424] DON’T SEE ANYTHING.
[ct=3665.106] KIRK: THAT’S CLEAN.
[ct=3668.910] DRAKE LONDON, 6’4", 213,
[ct=3670.755] HE’S TOUGH, GREAT CATCH
[ct=3671.324] RADIUS.
[ct=3672.801] BUT IT’S WHAT HE JUST
[ct=3674.340] SHOWED RIGHT THERE.
[ct=3675.482] YOU DON’T TYPICALLY SEE
[ct=3677.187] THAT FROM RECEIVERS WITH
[ct=3677.659] GREAT LENGTH.
[ct=3678.598] THEY DON’T HAVE
[ct=3679.999] THATTABLE TO FIGHT LIKE
[ct=3680.297] THAT.
[ct=3681.721] AND I THINK THAT TELLS
[ct=3683.014] YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
[ct=3683.669] HIS PERSONALITY, HIS
[ct=3685.092] THIRD YEAR OUT OF
[ct=3685.282] U.S.C.
[ct=3687.907] REFEREE: AFTER FURTHER
[ct=3688.894] REVIEW THE RULING ON THE
[ct=3689.782] FIELD STANDS AS CALLED.
[ct=3698.810] AL: SO 1:31.
[ct=3700.166] THE FALCONS HAVE ALL
[ct=3700.286] THEIR TIME-OUTS.
[ct=3716.625] FOUR-MAN RUSH.
[ct=3718.562] SAW IT ON THE -- CAUGHT
[ct=3720.069] ON THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=3720.765] GOES BACK TO LONDON.
[ct=3726.572] TACKLE THERE BY SMITH.
[ct=3730.641] KIRK: COUSINS IS A
[ct=3732.120] VETERAN WHO HAS BEEN IN
[ct=3733.165] THESE SITUATIONS MANY,
[ct=3734.245] MANY TIMES IN HIS
[ct=3739.190] PASS THROWN BEHIND.
[ct=3740.854] MAKING THE MOST OF IT,
[ct=3742.127] MAKING THE CATCH IS
[ct=3742.239] ROBINSON.
[ct=3745.459] GOT AWAY FROM DAVIDS
[ct=3746.804] WITH EXACTLY 60
[ct=3746.804] SECONDS.
[ct=3748.157] FIRST DOWN ON THE
[ct=3749.747] BUCCANEER’S SIDE OF THE
[ct=3750.004] FIELD.
[ct=3753.573] KIRK: THAT’S SOMETHING
[ct=3755.623] HE MAY MISS, MORE
[ct=3757.790] IMPORTANTLY HE PICKS UP
[ct=3759.155] THE FIRST DOWN AND
[ct=3760.180] CROSSES MIDFIELD.
[ct=3761.183] YOU THINK DAVID WILL
[ct=3764.089] MAKE THE TACKLE BUT
[ct=3764.487] ROBINSON PRIDES HIMSELF
[ct=3765.140] ON THE FIRST GUY
[ct=3765.733] MISSING.
[ct=3766.649] THAT TIME HE SHOWED
[ct=3768.182] QUICKNESS AND POWER TO
[ct=3770.648] GET OUT OF THAT.
[ct=3773.878] AL: DAVIDS HAS ONLY MADE
[ct=3776.044] 150RBGZ 0 TACKLES IN HIS
[ct=3777.423] CAREER BUT NOT THERE.
[ct=3780.149] OPEN TO THE 39-YARD LINE
[ct=3781.783] RAY-RAY MCCLOUD, SECOND
[ct=3782.900] DUNN AND 2.
[ct=3786.050] KIRK: GOOD DECISION
[ct=3786.822] QUICK BY COUSINS.
[ct=3788.269] CHECK IT DUNN.
[ct=3789.508] TAKE THE POSITIVE
[ct=3794.856] AL: KEEP IT ROLLING.
[ct=3796.235] NO HUDDLE TO THE
[ct=3797.526] PASS IS CAUGHT.
[ct=3798.525] LONDON.
[ct=3800.068] CONTINUES HIS BIG
[ct=3802.944] THAT’LL STOP THE CLOCK
[ct=3803.264] WITH 34 SECONDS.
[ct=3809.495] LONDON IS 6-64 YARDS.
[ct=3813.480] COUSINS IS ON A 500-YARD
[ct=3813.480] PACE.
[ct=3818.648] KIRK: WHEN KIRK COUSINS
[ct=3820.012] SIGN WITH ATLANTA,
[ct=3821.612] EVERYBODY WAS PICTURING
[ct=3822.947] WHAT HE COULD BE FOR
[ct=3823.414] THIS OFFENSE.
[ct=3824.847] IN THE FIRST COUPLE OF
[ct=3826.744] GAMES WE’VE SEEN
[ct=3827.494] INCONSISTENCIES BUT
[ct=3829.306] TONIGHT WE’RE SEEING THE
[ct=3830.141] KIRK COUSINS WE THOUGHT
[ct=3830.668] WE MIGHT SEE.
[ct=3832.979] AL: FIRED OVER THE
[ct=3834.461] MIDDLE, TIPPED,
[ct=3834.973] INCOMPLETE.
[ct=3835.676] TRYING TO GET THAT ONE
[ct=3836.396] TO LONDON.
[ct=3839.287] WHITEHEAD WAS THERE TO
[ct=3840.027] BREAK UP THE PLAY.
[ct=3846.880] KIRK: THESE SAFETIES
[ct=3847.476] HAVE BEEN DROPPING ON
[ct=3847.897] THIS DRIVE.
[ct=3850.132] THIS TIME THE VETERAN,
[ct=3851.495] WHITEHEAD, DOES A GOOD
[ct=3852.774] JOB SINKING, COMING
[ct=3853.588] UNDERNEATH.
[ct=3854.914] I THINK HE SURPRISED

[ct=4645.198] OF THE RECEIVER ON THAT
[ct=4648.126] KIRK: HE’S SITTING THERE
[ct=4649.588] WAITING FOR THIS.
[ct=4652.116] I HEAR HE DOES -- RIGHT
[ct=4652.670] HERE HE DOES A GOOD JOB
[ct=4653.462] PUSHING THE BIG LEFT
[ct=4655.777] TACKLE, JAKE MATTHEWS,
[ct=4657.404] INTO THE QUARTERBACK.
[ct=4658.898] HURRY UP AGAIN HERE
[ct=4659.890] THIRD DOWN.
[ct=4662.984] AL: THIRD AND 10.
[ct=4665.103] SHORT OF THE FIRST
[ct=4669.599] THEY’RE AT THE 43-YARD
[ct=4671.599] SEVEN-POINT GAME.
[ct=4673.070] EARLY THIRD.
[ct=4675.246] LINING UP TO GO FOR IT
[ct=4677.667] ON A FOURTH DOWN AND 3.
[ct=4682.030] AWAY THEY GO.
[ct=4684.756] BIG THROW.
[ct=4687.232] THE PASS, OPEN, CAUGHT,
[ct=4688.657] 30-YARD LINE, SPINNING
[ct=4689.930] AROUND, THROWN OUT OF
[ct=4691.792] BOUNDS AT THE 28 YIRLD
[ct=4692.244] IS MOONEY.
[ct=4696.887] FOURTH DOWN AND 3, A
[ct=4697.640] GAIN OF 14.
[ct=4701.020] KIRK: YOU KNOW ON FOURTH
[ct=4701.882] DOWN, THIS OFFENSIVE
[ct=4702.690] LINE, THERE’S NO BLITZ.
[ct=4703.956] THERE’S FOUR GUYS ABLE
[ct=4704.420] TO COME HERE.
[ct=4705.268] WATCH THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=4706.475] THEY’RE HOLDING ON.
[ct=4706.958] THE DEFENSE IS DOING
[ct=4709.132] EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO
[ct=4710.209] AFFECT COUSINS.
[ct=4711.516] THEY DON’T NECESSARILY
[ct=4712.215] HIT HIM BUT THEY AFFECT
[ct=4714.030] HE’S FALLING OFF THAT
[ct=4714.030] THROW.
[ct=4715.262] STILL HAS ENOUGH ON IT
[ct=4716.908] TO GET THAT BALL THROWN
[ct=4717.258] TO MOONEY.
[ct=4718.380] LOOKS RIGHT.
[ct=4719.093] COMES BACK.
[ct=4720.730] DOESN’T WANT TO COME
[ct=4721.795] BACK ON THAT FOURTH DOWN
[ct=4723.319] DOESN’T HAVE A LOT ON IT
[ct=4726.425] BUT ENOUGH TO GET IT OUT
[ct=4730.357] AL: COUSINS HAS THROWN
[ct=4731.141] FOR 300 YARDS.
[ct=4733.065] BACKWARD PASS.
[ct=4734.593] MOONEY STOPPED OFF A
[ct=4735.874] MINIMAL GAIN.
[ct=4740.299] KIRK: I LOVE HOW ZACH
[ct=4741.595] ROBINSON AND KIRK
[ct=4742.892] COUSINS ARE MIXING UP
[ct=4743.658] THE TEMPO.
[ct=4746.759] THAT’S ONE OF THE THINGS
[ct=4748.626] HE TALKED ABOUT, I SAID
[ct=4751.790] WITH SEAN MCVAY BEING A
[ct=4752.681] QUARTERBACK COACH FOR SO
[ct=4754.922] MANY YEAR HE TALKED
[ct=4755.620] ABOUT KEEPING THEM ON
[ct=4756.108] THEIR HEELS.
[ct=4757.602] GOING UP AGAINST AN
[ct=4759.208] THAT’S ONE THING YOU
[ct=4760.382] HAVE TO DO.
[ct=4761.110] ESPECIALLY ON THIRD AND
[ct=4761.918] LONG, SECOND AND LONG.
[ct=4763.290] TRYING TO GO FAST
[ct=4764.844] TEMPOS, NOT ALLOW THEM
[ct=4765.760] TO DEGREE THEIR CLEATS
[ct=4766.951] IN AND COME AFTER YOU.
[ct=4770.350] AL: SECOND AND 8
[ct=4770.778] PRESSURE AGAIN.
[ct=4772.277] SHOULD BE A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4774.786] HE HAD NO CATCHES.
[ct=4776.157] LAST WEEK.
[ct=4777.853] TONIGHT VERY MUCH A PART
[ct=4780.225] OF THE PROCESS.
[ct=4781.612] FIVE GRABS FOR 74
[ct=4782.743] PRESSURE PUT ON THAT
[ct=4784.064] TIME BY WHITEHEAD.
[ct=4787.291] KIRK: DOUBLE-A MUG
[ct=4787.927] LOOK.
[ct=4789.052] BRING THE SAFETY ON TOP
[ct=4789.338] OF THAT.
[ct=4790.707] NOT ENOUGH GUYS TO BE
[ct=4791.914] ABLE TO PICK HIM UP.
[ct=4794.062] GREAT JOB FEELING THAT.
[ct=4795.505] KNOWING THE CLOCK IS
[ct=4796.262] TICKING.
[ct=4797.530] BARELY GETS THE SECOND
[ct=4798.003] HITCH OFF.
[ct=4799.471] LOOK AT THE ACCURACY
[ct=4800.069] TONIGHT BY 18.

[ct=4801.920] SO WELL.
[ct=4806.617] AL: FROM THE 18.
[ct=4807.963] START HERE.
[ct=4810.464] A NICE TACKLE.
[ct=4812.585] A FLAG.

[ct=4827.442] IT’S LONDON.
[ct=4831.525] KIRK: KIND OF A
[ct=4833.283] REPEATING THEME FOR THIS
[ct=4835.552] MOVE, MOVE, MOVE, AND
[ct=4835.909] THEN PENALTIES AND
[ct=4837.100] SELF-DESTRUCTING.
[ct=4837.948] REFEREE: TWO FOULS
[ct=4838.627] DURING PLAY.
[ct=4839.378] BOTH BY THE OFFENSE.
[ct=4842.624] INELIGIBLE PLAYER
[ct=4843.390] ILLEGALLY DOWNFIELD,
[ct=4843.826] NUMBER 70.
[ct=4844.590] PENALTY DECLINED.
[ct=4845.707] PASS INTERFERENCE.
[ct=4846.151] NUMBER 12.
[ct=4847.142] THAT PENALTY WILL BE
[ct=4847.828] ACCEPTED.
[ct=4848.746] 10-YARD PENALTY.
[ct=4852.992] EXCUSE ME.
[ct=4854.614] AL: YOU’RE RIGHT.
[ct=4857.328] FINISHING -- LAST YEAR,
[ct=4859.119] THIS TEAM WAS 29TH IN
[ct=4859.692] THE RED ZONE.
[ct=4862.882] KIRK: YEAH.
[ct=4864.985] THAT’S HUGE PROBLEM FOR
[ct=4865.975] THEM THESE LAST COUPLE
[ct=4866.377] OF WEEKS.
[ct=4869.794] YOU COULD SEE HODGE WITH
[ct=4870.299] THE INTERFERENCE.
[ct=4871.668] SAW THE HOLD BY LONDON.
[ct=4872.520] RED ZONE THIS YEAR.
[ct=4875.465] YOU MENTIONED 29TH LAST
[ct=4876.457] 29TH THIS YEAR.
[ct=4877.721] HAD THEIR OPPORTUNITIES,
[ct=4878.940] SEE IF THEY CAN FINISH
[ct=4880.190] THE DRIVE OFF AFTER A
[ct=4880.308] MISCUE.
[ct=4884.052] AL: FIRST AND 20 FROM
[ct=4884.689] THE 28-YARD LINE.
[ct=4890.800] TO THE 22 GOES BIJOHN
[ct=4890.800] RONSON.
[ct=4891.635] HIS EIGHTH CARRY OF THE
[ct=4893.520] ONLY 24 YARDS.
[ct=4896.951] THREE YARDS PER TOTE.
[ct=4907.486] FALCONS HAVE RUSHED ONLY
[ct=4908.830] 10 TIMES TONIGHT.
[ct=4910.099] THROWN 38.
[ct=4916.452] SECOND AND 14.
[ct=4926.102] GOT HIM BY THE SHIRT
[ct=4927.424] COLLAR.
[ct=4927.951] DOWN HE GOES.
[ct=4930.774] ANTHONY NELSON WILL GET
[ct=4931.248] THAT SACK.
[ct=4938.214] NELSON MAKING HIS FIRST
[ct=4939.105] BIG PLAY OF THE NIGHT TO
[ct=4940.724] MAKE IT THIRD DOWN AND
[ct=4940.724] 22.
[ct=4944.060] KIRK: HE HAS TREMENDOUS
[ct=4945.149] LENGTH, GOOD EFFORT.
[ct=4947.004] IT’S THE COVERAGE
[ct=4947.268] DOWNFIELD THAT ALLOWS
[ct=4948.175] HIM TO GET HOME.
[ct=4950.835] THE DOUBLE MOVE BY
[ct=4952.677] HIS EYES ON THAT
[ct=4953.128] QUARTERBACK.
[ct=4954.365] THERE’S NO CHANCE THAT
[ct=4955.143] HE’S GOING TO FALL FOR
[ct=4957.575] YOU CAN SEE THAT STUTTER
[ct=4957.803] AND GO.
[ct=4958.762] HE’S RIGHT THERE.
[ct=4961.792] THAT’S WHY COUSINS JUST
[ct=4962.352] ATE IT.
[ct=4964.670] AL: BACKED UP AGAIN.
[ct=4966.073] THIRD AND 22.
[ct=4968.761] REACHING DOWN,
[ct=4970.416] TRIED TO GET IT TO
[ct=4970.768] DARNELL MOONEY.
[ct=4973.662] THROW IS LOW.
[ct=4974.789] FOURTH AND 22.
[ct=4976.762] IN COMES THE FIELD GOAL
[ct=4977.525] UNIT.
[ct=4979.715] KIRK: WE TALKED EARLIER
[ct=4981.187] ABOUT LAST YEAR BEFORE
[ct=4982.285] THE ACHILLES AND THEN
[ct=4984.692] AFTER THIS YEAR COMING
[ct=4986.160] BACK 11 MONTHS.
[ct=4987.281] COUSINS JUST SOMETIMES
[ct=4988.096] DOESN’T QUITE -- THAT
[ct=4988.979] BALL COULD HAVE BEEN
[ct=4990.646] SOMETIMES WE CAN’T QUITE
[ct=4991.597] DRIVE OFF THAT BACK
[ct=4993.275] THE BALL TENDS TO DROP
[ct=4994.099] ON HIM NEAR THE END.
[ct=4995.935] IT DID THAT TIME.
[ct=4997.877] MOONEY COULD HAVE MADE
[ct=4999.163] THE CATCH BUT THE BALL
[ct=4999.281] DOWN LOW.
[ct=5002.918] AL: ILLUSTRATED THAT
[ct=5003.125] PERFECTLY BEFORE.
[ct=5005.259] TRYING TO PLANT THAT
[ct=5006.340] BACK FOOT.
[ct=5009.926] KOO.
[ct=5010.389] IS GOOD.
[ct=5014.613] 6:21 TO PLAY IN THE
[ct=5015.542] THIRD QUARTER.
[ct=5020.166] LOOK AT THE LAST PASS
[ct=5022.463] WHICH WAS DROPPED,
[ct=5022.936] 24-20.
[ct=5031.067] LUDACRIS ON HAND
[ct=5032.362] SWINGING AND ROCKING TO

[ct=5056.141] TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=5058.932] BAKER MAYFIELD.
[ct=5060.576] THREE TOUCHDOWN PASSES
[ct=5062.458] MIKE EVANS.
[ct=5065.250] 4-49.
[ct=5066.333] TWO T.D.’S.
[ct=5067.856] 100 NOW FOR HIS
[ct=5069.074] SPECTACULAR CAREER.
[ct=5082.852] THE TWO HEAD COACHES,
[ct=5085.129] WELL-ACQUAINTED WITH
[ct=5085.129] EACH OTHER THROUGH THE
[ct=5085.485] YEARS.
[ct=5086.890] THE BALL IS OUT.
[ct=5087.485] DOES HE GET IT?
[ct=5088.541] DOES HE SAVE THE DAY?
[ct=5089.198] HE DOES.
[ct=5094.922] GODWIN HAD IT PUNCHED
[ct=5096.095] OUT THAT TIME BY BATES.
[ct=5099.071] EVANS IS RIGHT THERE.
[ct=5111.215] KIRK: BALL GOES OUT.
[ct=5112.615] ANYBODY’S FOOTBALL.
[ct=5113.769] BOY DID THAT PLAY OPEN
[ct=5114.624] UP A LITTLE PLAY ACTION
[ct=5116.143] MOVE TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=5116.914] LINEBACKERS FLOWED.
[ct=5119.000] FOR BAKER.
[ct=5122.970] AL: A GAIN OF 21.
[ct=5124.397] THE BALL INTO FALCON
[ct=5125.082] TERRITORY.
[ct=5127.597] ON THE MOVE.
[ct=5129.027] CAUGHT TO THE 40-YARD
[ct=5130.990] CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN
[ct=5132.335] GOES GODWIN.
[ct=5134.525] AL: LET’S LOOK AT
[ct=5135.869] OUR --
[ct=5136.495] KIRK: LET’S LOOK AT OUR
[ct=5137.834] NEXT GENERAL STATS
[ct=5140.489] POWERED BY AWS.
[ct=5140.489] ATLANTA IS NOT
[ct=5141.789] BLITZ.
[ct=5141.999] THE PROBLEM IS THEY
[ct=5143.895] UP BLITZES.
[ct=5144.494] THESE LAST FOUR YEARS
[ct=5145.329] THEY HAVE REALLY
[ct=5146.680] STRUGGLED.
[ct=5148.492] THINK ABOUT THE LAST
[ct=5150.715] GREAT PASS RUSHER, WE
[ct=5152.892] WERE TALKING, VIC
[ct=5154.609] BEASLEY, JOHN ABRAHAM,
[ct=5155.466] WHO HAVE THEY REALLY
[ct=5156.505] HAD?
[ct=5157.718] A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE
[ct=5158.474] CONCERNED WHEN THEY
[ct=5159.561] DIDN’T PICK ONE THIS
[ct=5164.887] WENT WITH PENIX WHO I
[ct=5166.002] THINK WILL BE A GREAT
[ct=5170.268] AL: THAT’S A WHOLE
[ct=5171.355] DIFFERENT STORY, WE’LL
[ct=5172.859] TALK ABOUT IT WHEN THEY
[ct=5174.002] HAVE THE BALL.
[ct=5174.484] STOP AT THE LINE OF
[ct=5177.800] KIRK: JIMMY LAKE WHO HAS
[ct=5179.349] BEEN AROUND THE NFL AND
[ct=5179.811] COLLEGE.
[ct=5180.562] I THOUGHT IT WAS
[ct=5181.623] INTERESTING.
[ct=5181.992] DEFENSIVE GUY.
[ct=5183.529] LAST YEAR GOES AND WORKS
[ct=5184.706] WITH THE RAMS AND WAS
[ct=5185.868] WORKING ON THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=5186.539] SIDE.
[ct=5187.735] HE’S IN THE MEETINGS
[ct=5190.310] WITH MATTHEW STAFFORD
[ct=5191.144] AND SEAN
[ct=5191.581] AND S SEAN MCVAY.
[ct=5193.575] AS A DEFENSIVE COACH
[ct=5194.431] HE’S HELPING THEM.
[ct=5195.453] NOW HE GETS A CHANCE TO
[ct=5196.278] BE A DEFENSIVE
[ct=5196.965] COORDINATOR AFTER THAT
[ct=5197.333] EXPERIENCE HE
[ct=5198.510] UNDERSTANDS OFFENSES
[ct=5199.425] THAT MUCH BETTER.
[ct=5203.761] AL: MAYFIELD ESCAPES,
[ct=5204.745] HE’S GOING TO RUN, BANG
[ct=5206.412] HIS WAY CLOSE TO A FIRST
[ct=5207.279] DOWN TO THE 29-YARD
[ct=5210.512] GOT A SPOT AT THE 29.
[ct=5211.915] SEE IF THEY GIVE HIM THE
[ct=5212.671] FIRST OR NOT.
[ct=5221.555] ARE THEY -- WHERE ARE
[ct=5223.504] THEY GOING TO PUT IT?
[ct=5224.409] KIRK: THEY’RE GOING
[ct=5226.253] FASTER ON THIRD DOWN AND
[ct=5227.453] SHORT TO GET PRESSURE ON
[ct=5228.253] GRAHAM.
[ct=5232.262] AL: INSTEAD, SWEEP IT TO
[ct=5233.758] THE OUTSIDE AND GO TO
[ct=5238.604] FLAG IS THROWN AT THE
[ct=5239.289] END OF THAT PLAY.
[ct=5243.724] BERTRAND WAS THERE.
[ct=5245.119] HE LOOKS UP AT THE BOARD
[ct=5247.684] WHICH IS A MILE HIGH
[ct=5248.794] HERE IN ATLANTA.
[ct=5252.049] NEED NECK SURGERY AFTER
[ct=5252.395] LOOKING AT THIS THING.
[ct=5255.395] KIRK: HOW ABOUT GODWIN.
[ct=5256.725] HE THROWS SHEPHERD
[ct=5258.175] HE’S DOARMD GET THE
[ct=5260.045] REFEREE: AFTER THE PLAY
[ct=5260.986] WAS OVER, PERSONAL
[ct=5261.377] FOUL.
[ct=5262.386] UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS.
[ct=5264.191] NUMBER 40.
[ct=5268.498] KIRK: I’M NOT SURE
[ct=5270.357] SHEPHERD DIDN’T TAKE THE
[ct=5271.332] WORST OF THAT.
[ct=5272.960] HE GOT DRILLED BY HIS
[ct=5272.960] FELLOW RECEIVER.
[ct=5274.136] FIRST DUNN AND THEN 15
[ct=5274.787] ON TOP OF IT.
[ct=5280.038] AL: FRIENDLY FIRE.
[ct=5281.599] BERTRAND IS BACK PLAYING
[ct=5283.204] TONIGHT IN PLACE OF TROY
[ct=5284.251] ANDERSON WHO HAD THAT
[ct=5285.639] SPECTACULAR GAME ON
[ct=5286.033] SUNDAY.
[ct=5290.378] KIRK: DON’T OVERLOOK
[ct=5291.812] THAT THIRD DOWN SCRAMBLE
[ct=5294.871] BY BAKER MAYFIELD, THAT
[ct=5295.924] SCRAMBLE TO GET HIM TO
[ct=5296.766] THIRD AND SHORT.
[ct=5298.073] THAT’S X FACTOR THAT
[ct=5299.279] BAKER BRINGS.
[ct=5300.201] THEY DON’T WANT HIM TO
[ct=5302.526] ALWAYS RELY ON THAT.
[ct=5303.780] BUT HERE AND THERE, WHEN
[ct=5305.610] HE REALLY OPENS UP, YOU
[ct=5306.942] TAKE IT WHICH HE DID.
[ct=5308.455] ON THAT OCCASION.
[ct=5314.869] AL: 3:40 TO GO IN THE
[ct=5320.079] FIRST DOWN AT THE 14.
[ct=5327.589] STOPPED AT THE LINE OF
[ct=5331.117] IRVING TAKEN DOWN THERE
[ct=5331.117] BY JARRETT.
[ct=5336.511] KIRK: WHAT A PLAY BY
[ct=5336.861] JARRETT.
[ct=5338.175] GETS AROUND BARTON TO
[ct=5338.601] CENTER.
[ct=5339.749] WATCH THE CENTER TRYING
[ct=5341.265] TO COME BACK AND PICK UP
[ct=5341.265] THAT BLOCK.
[ct=5343.234] BUT THAT IS A TOUGH
[ct=5344.488] ASSIGNMENT FOR A ROOKIE
[ct=5345.276] FOR ANY CENTER.
[ct=5347.295] OUTSIDE SHADE.
[ct=5348.816] THEN JUST TRYING TO GET
[ct=5350.051] BACK TO HIM.
[ct=5351.619] SUCH A QUICK FIRST
[ct=5352.182] STEP.
[ct=5353.747] HE’S IN THE BACKFIELD
[ct=5354.877] BEFORE BARTON CAN EVEN
[ct=5355.851] TURN TO TRY TO GET HIM
[ct=5357.205] BLOCKED.
[ct=5358.665] SEAL HIM OFF, CHASING
[ct=5358.919] THAT PLAY.
[ct=5364.478] AL: BARTON PLAYED AT
[ct=5367.135] DUKE, 26TH OVERALL.
[ct=5368.449] OVER THE MIDDLE THAT.
[ct=5368.772] THAT’S TAUGHT.
[ct=5370.349] COUPLE OF YARDS SHY OF
[ct=5371.060] THE FIRST.
[ct=5372.841] BERTRAND MAKING THIS --
[ct=5374.636] MAKES THE TACKLE.
[ct=5375.895] THIRD AND 2.
[ct=5379.761] KIRK: PART OF ATLANTA’S
[ct=5380.869] DEFENSIVE SCHEME THAT
[ct=5381.823] THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH
[ct=5383.887] WITH JIMMY LAKE AND
[ct=5384.781] MORRIS IS YOU’RE GOING
[ct=5385.684] TO KEEP THINGS IN FRONT
[ct=5386.050] OF YOU.
[ct=5387.496] LIKE A LOT OF DEFENSES
[ct=5388.972] IN THE NFL THESE DAYS.
[ct=5390.544] THEN YOU GET TEAM INTO
[ct=5391.607] THE RED ZONE AND YOU
[ct=5392.118] SQUEEZE THEM.
[ct=5394.519] TRY TO GET THEM TO FORCE
[ct=5395.804] THE FIELD GOALS.
[ct=5396.411] DON’T GIVE UP
[ct=5398.025] HERE’S A CHANCE ON THIRD
[ct=5408.418] AL: WHITE.
[ct=5414.479] BREAKS DOWN, SACKED AT
[ct=5414.907] THE 15-YARD LINE.
[ct=5421.454] MAYFIELD IS SHAKING HIS
[ct=5422.456] LEG AS HE GETS UP.
[ct=5426.717] KIRK: THEY WALKED UP
[ct=5428.398] FIVE, SIX GUYS.
[ct=5430.893] THEN END UP RUSHING
[ct=5431.217] THREE AND DROPPING
[ct=5431.217] EIGHT.
[ct=5432.405] JUST TRYING TO CONFUSE
[ct=5433.715] THE OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=5435.536] AND IT’S A HECK OF A
[ct=5437.815] BAKER MAYFIELD, I THINK,
[ct=5438.599] ANTICIPATING SOME
[ct=5440.144] THEY END UP THROWING HIM
[ct=5441.239] A CURVEBALL THERE BY
[ct=5444.219] DROPPING IN COVERAGE.
[ct=5446.729] AL: HE GETS TWISTED AS
[ct=5448.941] WELL.
[ct=5448.941] MCLAUGHLIN.
[ct=5451.758] 32-YARD FIELD GOAL
[ct=5454.299] EASY PICKINGS.
[ct=5458.749] WITH ONE 1:17 REMAINING
[ct=5461.640] IN THE THIRD, BAKER
[ct=5462.550] TAKES A SEAT ON THE
[ct=5462.947] BENCH.
[ct=5463.460] THEY’LL LOOK AT HIM.
[ct=5465.072] 27-20.IN 1976.
[ct=5468.166] SERVED THROUGH JANUARY OF 1981.
[ct=5472.302] WHAT A LIFE THAT MAN HAS LIVED.
[ct=5473.169] INCREDIBLE WHAT HE'S DONE OVER
[ct=5475.625] THE LAST 44 YEARS.
[ct=5476.960] BUILDING HOMES.
[ct=5480.781] A LIFE WELL LIVED.
[ct=5480.781] WELL LIVED.
[ct=5489.244] TAMPA BAY ON TOP.
[ct=5492.818] THE FALCONS START AT THE 30 YARD
[ct=5494.205] ATLANTA PLAYING THESE VERY CLOSE
[ct=5497.528] GAMES.
[ct=5497.980] AGAIN, 01 POSITION GAME.
[ct=5500.326] YOU CAN'T MAKE TOO MUCH OF AN
[ct=5503.301] EARLY-SEASON GAME.
[ct=5504.793] BUT EITHER ATLANTA COULD TIE
[ct=5506.503] TAMPA BAY AT THE TOP OR THEY
[ct=5508.089] WILL BE TWO GAMES BACK AFTER
[ct=5508.355] FIVE WEEKS.
[ct=5512.558] KIRK: THEY PLAY IN FIVE WEEKS
[ct=5514.195] ANYTIME YOU GET AN OPPORTUNITY
[ct=5515.789] TO PLAY A DIVISION RIVAL, YOU
[ct=5517.415] WANT TO TAKE A STEP FORWARD
[ct=5517.994] BECAUSE IT MATTERS SO MUCH WHEN
[ct=5520.006] YOU GET TO THE END.
[ct=5521.681] YOU CAN FEEL THAT.
[ct=5522.180] YOU CAN FEEL THE INTENSITY.
[ct=5523.709] THE WEIGHT EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT
[ct=5527.111] A SHORT WEEK AND THE DEFENSE
[ct=5528.174] HAVING AN ADVANTAGE.
[ct=5528.848] TONIGHT, WE'VE SEEN TWO
[ct=5529.338] QUARTERBACKS THAT HAVE PLAYED
[ct=5532.297] BOTH INCREDIBLY WELL PREPARED.
[ct=5535.160] DOING A GREAT JOB WITH ATTACKING
[ct=5535.565] THE DEFENSE.
[ct=5541.621] CHARISSA: THIS WILL FLARE OUT.
[ct=5542.485] MOONEY, SHORT.
[ct=5544.261] DOWN TO KAYLEE.
[ct=5549.753] >> YOU SAW BAKER MAYFIELD
[ct=5551.998] HOBBLING ON HIS RIGHT KNEE.
[ct=5553.041] SINCE THEN HE'S BEEN BACK ON THE
[ct=5556.532] HE HAS HAD HIS HEAD IN THE IPAD.
[ct=5559.410] HE JUST STOOD UP FOR THE FIRST
[ct=5561.196] HE WAVED OFF ANY MEDICAL
[ct=5561.668] ATTENTION.
[ct=5564.410] TAKING A FEW STEPS RIGHT NOW.
[ct=5566.596] IT DOESN'T LOOK AS SERIOUS AS IT
[ct=5567.305] LOOKED LIKE IT COULD HAVE BEEN
[ct=5567.702] WHEN HE FIRST GOT HIT.
[ct=5569.784] AL: SURE.
[ct=5570.948] THE BACKUP QUARTERBACK WILL BE
[ct=5571.461] KYLE TRASK.
[ct=5576.291] FAKE AND THE PASS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=5576.291] WELL CONTESTED.
[ct=5580.766] THIRD DOWN AND 8.
[ct=5583.647] KIRK: THE EMPHASIS ON THE HIT
[ct=5586.075] DROP TACKLE THIS YEAR.
[ct=5590.553] THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN’T SEE A
[ct=5591.942] PENALTY COMING IN ON THE TACKLE
[ct=5593.975] BY THE FALCONS DEFENSE.
[ct=5596.727] WE'VE GOT A THIRD DOWN.
[ct=5598.350] COUSINS WHEN HE'S HAD TIME HAS
[ct=5599.543] BEEN ABLE TO WORK THROUGH HIS
[ct=5602.768] PROGRESSIONS AND FIND AN OPEN
[ct=5603.379] TARGET.
[ct=5604.333] GREAT TARGET TONIGHT.
[ct=5605.230] GREAT TO SEE HE'S OFF TO THE
[ct=5606.940] LEFT.
[ct=5607.740] THREE BY ONE BY HIMSELF.
[ct=5614.005] AL: HE'S CAUGHT FIVE
[ct=5615.320] SIX TARGETS.
[ct=5615.893] STRAIGHT OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=5618.866] IT WILL HIT THE LARD LINE.
[ct=5621.580] RAY-RAY MCCLOUD.
[ct=5623.112] BIG FIRST DOWN ON THE
[ct=5623.112] CONVERSION.
[ct=5628.752] KIRK: BECAUSE OF THAT FORMATION,
[ct=5629.706] WATCH HOW QUICKLY LAMONTE DAVID
[ct=5631.111] CLEARS OUT.
[ct=5633.120] WATCH KIRK COUSINS ANTICIPATE
[ct=5633.524] THIS THROW.
[ct=5637.137] RIGHT THERE, WIDE-OPEN, RIGHT IN
[ct=5637.711] THE MIDDLE OF THE DEFENSE FROM
[ct=5639.216] TAMPA BAY.
[ct=5641.768] COUSINS HAS REALLY FELT THE
[ct=5642.431] RHYTHM, THE TIMING SO MUCH
[ct=5645.211] BETTER TONIGHT THEN HE HAS AT
[ct=5645.562] ANY POINT THIS YEAR.
[ct=5649.138] AL: WANING SECONDS OF THE
[ct=5655.398] BIG PULL, LEFT SIDE.
[ct=5657.224] BREAKING THE TACKLE.
[ct=5657.792] INSIDE THE 30.
[ct=5659.373] BE JON ROBINSON.
[ct=5662.126] HIS BIGGEST RUN OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=5665.540] THAT TAKES US TO THE END OF THE
[ct=5668.209] THIRD QUARTER, AFTER A 29 YARD
[ct=5669.980] GALLUP.
[ct=5670.798] GOOD GAME.
[ct=5675.431] TAMPA BAY ON TOP BY A SCORE OF
[ct=5678.788] 27-20 AS WE HAD TO THE FOURTH ON
[ct=5679.614] THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL.
[ct=5681.204] SEAHAWKS NEXT
[ct=5681.643] THURSDAY.
[ct=5682.147] THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL FROM THE
[ct=5683.562] NORTHWEST.
[ct=5685.124] FIRST DOWN AT THE 18 YARD LINE.
[ct=5693.206] ROBINSON SPLITS THE NICE LITTLE
[ct=5695.896] HOLE THERE.
[ct=5696.958] THRUSTING FORWARD.
[ct=5697.313] GETS THE MOST OUT OF THAT RUN.
[ct=5700.570] KIRK: STARTING TO SEE THE
[ct=5701.148] OFFENSIVE LINE DO SOME WORK.
[ct=5702.512] THIS IS RIGHT BEFORE THE END OF
[ct=5705.118] THE THIRD QUARTER.
[ct=5705.658] WATCH THE CENTER AND RIGHT
[ct=5706.828] NICE JOB GETTING UP TO THE
[ct=5707.338] BACKER.
[ct=5710.664] DOES A NICE JOB TURNING.
[ct=5712.521] THAT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT
[ct=5713.661] BE JON ROBINSON CAN DO HERE.
[ct=5716.829] FEELS THE ZONE AND BREAK THE
[ct=5716.829] TACKLE.
[ct=5719.998] HAS AN ABILITY TO BE MUCH MORE
[ct=5723.699] PHYSICAL THAN MOST PEOPLE
[ct=5723.699] REALIZE.
[ct=5725.113] VERY ELUSIVE BUT HE CAN GET
[ct=5726.082] BEHIND HIS PADS AS WELL.
[ct=5729.354] AL: SECOND AND 4.
[ct=5732.083] A LITTLE SHORT.
[ct=5738.330] IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 2.
[ct=5742.095] KIRK: IN TEXAS IN COLLEGE, HE
[ct=5744.407] WAS A GUY THAT RAN INSIDE ZONE
[ct=5745.450] AND MORE DUO.
[ct=5748.254] IT'S A DIFFERENT FEEL THAN THE
[ct=5748.705] OUTSIDE ZONES THAT THE ATLANTA
[ct=5749.332] FALCONS ARE RUNNING.
[ct=5751.589] HE'S GETTING A BETTER VISION AND
[ct=5752.542] PATIENTS WITH IT EVERY WEEK.
[ct=5757.167] AL: JORDAN WHITEHEAD SLOW TO
[ct=5758.538] RISE.
[ct=5761.681] HAD BEEN WITH TAMPA AND THEN
[ct=5764.486] WENT AWAY THE -- TO THE JETS
[ct=5765.944] DECIDED TO COME BACK TO THE
[ct=5766.123] BETTER WEATHER.
[ct=5768.885] AMONG OTHER THINGS.
[ct=5776.879] HE WILL HAVE TO COME OUT FOR AT
[ct=5779.720] LEAST ONE PLAY.
[ct=5783.874] THAT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 2
[ct=5785.913] FOR THE FALCONS.
[ct=5789.687] ATLANTA THIS SEASON, 4.5 GAMES
[ct=5789.687] INTO THE SEASON AND THEY HAVE
[ct=5793.493] NEVER TRAILED OR LED BY MORE
[ct=5793.700] THAN ONE POSSESSION.
[ct=5798.793] AT ANY POINT.
[ct=5804.196] KIRK: FORTUNATE TO BE WHERE THEY
[ct=5805.089] ARE RIGHT NOW WITH A RECORD OUT
[ct=5808.228] THAT'S WHERE THE POWER BACK
[ct=5808.228] COMES IN.
[ct=5814.376] DENNIS STARTING MIDDLE
[ct=5818.585] GOOD TO SEE HIM BACK.
[ct=5819.908] HE GOT HURT IN THE SECOND WEEK.
[ct=5822.715] A.C.L. SPRAIN.
[ct=5823.035] CAME BACK LAST WEEK.
[ct=5828.899] AL: THIRD DOWN AND 2.
[ct=5834.636] HE STARTS TO STUMBLE AND GETS
[ct=5834.636] TANGLED.
[ct=5839.903] THE COLUMN COMES UP TO MAKE THE
[ct=5844.220] NOW YOU ARE DOWN BY SEVEN.
[ct=5846.104] YOU'VE GOT A FOURTH DOWN AND 4.
[ct=5849.545] KIRK: THEY ARE GOING TO HURRY
[ct=5850.348] TRY TO SLOW DOWN TAMPA.
[ct=5854.268] AL: NO SUBSTITUTIONS.
[ct=5857.234] THE PASS IS CAUGHT.
[ct=5879.691] KIRK: GOOD JOB THERE.
[ct=5882.217] HAVING THE LUXURY OF A VETERAN
[ct=5885.639] QUARTERBACK, HURRY UP, TAKE THEM
[ct=5885.967] OUT OF THE AGGRESSIVE MINDSET.
[ct=5889.355] RAY-RAY MCCLOUD SETS THE SCREEN.
[ct=5891.606] MOODY GETS IN BEHIND HIM.
[ct=5892.896] MADE IT TOUGH ON THE DEFENDER TO
[ct=5895.080] STAY WITH HIM.
[ct=5896.392] GOOD SHAKE TO THE INSIDE
[ct=5900.440] PULLS AWAY FROM SMITH AND INTO
[ct=5901.747] THE END ZONE FOR THAT TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=5904.369] AL: THE EXTRA POINT IS GOOD.
[ct=5908.314] BEST THURSDAY NIGHT GAME OF THE
[ct=5908.314] SEASON.
[ct=5913.054] 27-27.
[ct=5920.893] THERE HE WAS IN THE TAMPA BAY
[ct=5920.893] UNIFORM.
[ct=5924.877] AT THAT TIME, WASHINGTON AGAINST
[ct=5924.877] DENVER.
[ct=5927.551] AFTER THE 87 CAMPAIGN.
[ct=5929.892] TOUCHBACK HERE.
[ct=5934.533] TAKE A LOOK AT THIS FIRST.
[ct=5935.959] THEN WE WILL GET BACK TO DOUG
[ct=5939.826] AND A SECOND KIRK: -- IN A KIRK:
[ct=5939.826] SECOND.
[ct=5941.197] NEXGEN STATS.
[ct=5943.779] THE FIRST HALF, ZERO PRESSURE.
[ct=5946.502] THE ONLY TEAM IN THE NFL WITH
[ct=5947.924] ZERO PRESSURES IN THE FIRST
[ct=5950.450] IN THE SECOND HALF, THEY'VE BEEN
[ct=5951.781] ABLE TO DIAL IT UP MORE.
[ct=5954.391] PRETTY GOOD COVERAGE DOWNFIELD.
[ct=5958.422] GIVING HIM A CHANCE TO GET AFTER
[ct=5959.932] NUMBER SIX AND TRY TO SLOW HIM
[ct=5961.100] BETTER JOB OF GET
[ct=5962.406] THAT RHYTHM.
[ct=5966.399] AL: THEY FILLED IN THE POCKET.
[ct=5966.399] FIRES OVER THE
[ct=5970.009] EVANS MAKING THAT GRAB THERE.
[ct=5974.854] TONIGHT, FIVE CATCHES.
[ct=5977.999] WE WERE TALKING TO TODD BOWLES.
[ct=5977.999] TALKING ABOUT THAT DOUG WILLIAMS
[ct=5978.245] GAME.
[ct=5979.537] 42-DAN.
[ct=5983.190] -- 42-10.
[ct=5985.891] THEY ARE SAYING HE GOT BLAMED
[ct=5987.220] FOR GIVING UP A TOUCHDOWN TO
[ct=5989.799] REGINA TEAL.
[ct=5991.148] IT TURNS OUT IT WAS NOT
[ct=5992.497] COVERAGE ON THE PLAY.
[ct=5993.748] KIRK: HE WANTED
[ct=5995.147] KNEW THAT.
[ct=5997.825] AL: I SAID, DON'T BLAME ME.
[ct=6000.465] HE SAID, IT WASN'T YOU.
[ct=6001.983] I CAN'T GIVE AWAY WHO IT WAS.
[ct=6003.254] 43 YARD LINE.
[ct=6007.832] MAYFIELD STEPPING UP.
[ct=6009.048] GOING TO RUN WITH IT.
[ct=6011.777] FIRST DOWN AND SEVERAL MORE.
[ct=6014.436] MAYFIELD SHOWING NO EFFECTS OF
[ct=6015.632] THE TWISTED LEG ON THE LAST
[ct=6018.276] HE WAS IN BEFORE THE SERIES.
[ct=6023.384] KIRK: WATCH W
[ct=6024.834] CHRIS GODWIN WHEN HE COMES INTO
[ct=6024.834] WORK.
[ct=6028.660] SAFETY THERE.
[ct=6029.942] NOW HE WILL TAKE A LINEBACKERS
[ct=6029.942] AND SAFETIES WITH HIM.
[ct=6032.697] THERE'S NO ONE LEFT.
[ct=6032.697] EVERYBODY CLEARED UP.
[ct=6036.704] WONDERING HOW HE MIGHT FEEL.
[ct=6039.534] THIS IS USUALLY THE GAME OR
[ct=6040.823] BAKER MAYFIELD WILL TAKE OVER.
[ct=6043.499] NICE THROW.
[ct=6043.499] NICE SCRAMBLE.
[ct=6044.834] FOURTH QUARTER.
[ct=6044.834] TIE GAME.
[ct=6051.350] AL: HANDS IT OFF ON FIRST DOWN
[ct=6055.741] BESIDES THE ONE RUN, WHITE HAS
[ct=6058.154] DONE BASICALLY NOTHING TO GET
[ct=6059.491] CAME IN WITH LESS THAN A THREE
[ct=6062.246] YARD AVERAGE CARRY.
[ct=6066.187] BUT THAT WENT WAY UP WHEN HE RAN
[ct=6067.485] FOR 56.
[ct=6070.150] KIRK: EVEN THOUGH IT'S WEEK
[ct=6072.787] FIVE, THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO.
[ct=6075.559] THESE ARE THE KIND OF GAMES, YOU
[ct=6078.085] FIGHT WITH 11 COLEY'S
[ct=6079.388] TO GO.
[ct=6082.073] MAKE NO MISTAKE HOW YOU CAN USE
[ct=6083.340] THIS AS A GAME WHERE YOU CAN
[ct=6084.816] REALLY RALLY TOGETHER.
[ct=6087.468] SO A LOT ON THE LINE FOR BOTH
[ct=6088.744] THESE TEAMS IN THE L
[ct=6090.141] 11 MINUTES.
[ct=6094.027] AL: OUT OF THE RANGE.
[ct=6097.999] KIRK: THE GUY THAT'S
[ct=6099.305] GETTING SOME PRESSURE HERE IN
[ct=6101.967] THE SECOND HALF, WE JUST SHOWED
[ct=6101.967] YOU THE NEXGEN STATS.
[ct=6107.241] YOU SEE HIM WITH THE REDS.
[ct=6109.977] MOST RECOGNIZABLE NAME ON THE
[ct=6112.622] DEFENSE AS FAR AS THE ABILITY TO
[ct=6113.914] GET OUT TO THE QUARTERBACK.
[ct=6119.214] BAKER MAYFIELD HAS BEEN WORKING
[ct=6121.918] INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE DEFENSE.
[ct=6123.491] OBVIOUS TARGET WOULD BE MIKE
[ct=6124.593] DEVENS.
[ct=6127.238] CHRIS GODWIN ON THIRD DOWN
[ct=6129.907] ALWAYS AN OPTION FOR HIM AS
[ct=6133.818] >> TIMEOUT, TAMPA BAY.
[ct=6137.777] AL: THE BOX WILL TAKE A TIMEOUT
[ct=6139.116] PRIOR TO A THIRD DOWN AND 9.
[ct=6144.462] WHAT'S AT STAKE AT THE MOMENT,
[ct=6145.766] FOR GAMES INTO THE SEASON.
[ct=6145.766] ALMOST A QUARTER OF THE WAY
[ct=6147.134] THROUGH.
[ct=6149.748] 17 GAME CAMPAIGN.
[ct=6151.106] TAMPA BAY 3-1.
[ct=6153.713] SAINTS AT 2-2.

[ct=6167.049] I'M LOOKING AT MORRIS.
[ct=6169.672] GO BACK TO THAT WASHINGTON STAFF

[ct=6177.674] SEAN MCVAY'S FIN
[ct=6178.995] ALL OVER THE COACHING STAFF
[ct=6181.734] THESE DAYS AT 38 YEARS OLD.
[ct=6181.734] IT'S AMAZING.
[ct=6191.029] KIRK: ATLANTA WAS IN THE
[ct=6192.347] QUARTERBACK ROOM LAST YEAR.
[ct=6195.028] AL: THIRD DOWN AND 9.
[ct=6200.395] AVOIDS THE SACK.
[ct=6205.610] TAKES OFF BUT IS STOPPED AT THE
[ct=6207.141] 34 YARD LINE.
[ct=6208.409] IT WILL BE FOURTH DOWN, PRAISE
[ct=6209.817] IT -- PRESSURED BY KADEN ELLISS
[ct=6211.111] WHO HAS PLAYED EVERY DEFENSIVE
[ct=6213.668] STAT THIS SEASON FOR THE
[ct=6213.668] BUCCANEERS.
[ct=6222.885] KIRK: THAT'S BECAUSE OF WHAT HE
[ct=6224.376] CAN DO ONE THIRD DOWNS.
[ct=6225.561] HE WILL BRING HIM OFF THE EDGE.
[ct=6228.197] THIS TIME HE WRITES -- GOES
[ct=6228.197] RIGHT THROUGH RACHAAD WHITE.
[ct=6232.148] THEY ARE DIALING UP THE PRESSURE
[ct=6234.904] AL: 53 YARD ATTEMPT.
[ct=6257.441] 30-27, BOX ON TOP.
[ct=6264.105] YOU ARE UP HERE DOING THE

[ct=6298.875] KIRK: KIRK COUSINS HAS HAD A
[ct=6300.141] GREAT GAME TONIGHT.
[ct=6302.831] REALLY FELT IT.
[ct=6304.135] TALKED ABOUT HIS TIMING BEING
[ct=6304.135] OFF A
[ct=6305.471] TONIGHT, THAT HASN'T BEEN THE
[ct=6306.891] CASE.
[ct=6309.471] EVEN WHEN HE'S BEEN PRESSURE,
[ct=6310.805] HE'S HAD CONFIDENCE TO BE ABLE
[ct=6310.805] TO TRUST LONDON.
[ct=6313.465] MOONEY HAS HAD A LOT OF
[ct=6314.807] DIFFERENT GUYS INVOLVED TONIGHT.
[ct=6317.458] WHAT I CATCH THERE ON THE

[ct=7376.015] BALL BACK AFTER TAMPA WOULD RUN
[ct=7377.770] THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=7381.964] AND NOW, STILL WITH THREE
[ct=7383.153] TIMEOUTS, NOW THEY HAVE TO STILL
[ct=7385.017] POTENTIALLY DO THE SAME THING.
[ct=7385.846] THEY HAVE TO HOLD HIM TO A FIELD
[ct=7388.425] GOAL AND THEN THEY'VE GOT TO
[ct=7390.175] DRIVE THE LENGTH OF THE FIELD.
[ct=7391.170] MAYBE DOWN SIX POINTS.
[ct=7392.154] TRY TO GET THE TOUCHDOWN TO WIN
[ct=7395.515] AL: FOURTH AND 15.
[ct=7395.917] THAT'S TOUGH.
[ct=7395.917] VERY TOUGH.
[ct=7398.344] THE PASS WAS INTENDED FOR
[ct=7404.739] IF TAMPA HOLDS ON, THEY WILL
[ct=7405.926] BEFORE-ONE.
[ct=7407.983] FALCONS WILL GO TO 2-3.
[ct=7413.109] KIRK: THEY PUT BUCKY IRVING BACK
[ct=7413.109] OUT THERE EVEN AFTER THE FUM
[ct=7414.453] TO SHOW THE CONFIDENCE THEY
[ct=7416.741] STILL HAVEN'T HIM AS A ROOKIE.
[ct=7426.357] AL: GIVE IT TO HIM.
[ct=7430.966] SECURES AT THIS TIME.
[ct=7432.241] THE FLAG IS DOWN.
[ct=7434.516] STOP THE CLOCK.
[ct=7435.738] MIGHT HAVE A FACEMASK HERE.
[ct=7441.378] NUMBER 62.
[ct=7445.619] AL: THAT'S THE CENTER, BARTON.
[ct=7450.064] DID THEY MISS A FACEMASK HERE?
[ct=7453.254] LET'S TAKE A PEEK.
[ct=7461.548] KIRK: SURE LOOKS LIKE IT.
[ct=7464.659] BARTON WAS DEFINITELY OFFSETTING
[ct=7466.287] ON GRADY JARRETT.
[ct=7468.423] GRABS ONTO THE JERSEY AS HE
[ct=7472.916] AL: STEADY ON SECOND AND 23.

[ct=7493.212] BOUNDS AND HE DOES.
[ct=7496.441] KIRK: I KNOW IT'S A GUTSY CALL.
[ct=7498.427] I JUST HAPPEN TO BE LOOKING AT
[ct=7498.427] HIM LIVE.
[ct=7501.027] MIKE EVANS SNUCK OFF.
[ct=7502.362] THEY WANT TO BE CONSERVATIVE
[ct=7506.691] WHEN HE THINKS, OH MY GOODNESS
[ct=7507.145] GRACIOUS.
[ct=7521.842] EVERYBODY THINKING, RUN.
[ct=7525.589] AL: THIRD DOWN, 25.
[ct=7528.603] FALCONS ARE DOWN TO THEIR LAST
[ct=7528.603] TIMEOUT.
[ct=7534.649] FALCONS GO TO CAROLINA NEXT WEEK
[ct=7535.832] THEN SEATTLE COMES HERE.
[ct=7537.633] AND THEN AT TAMPA BAY.
[ct=7539.943] TAMPA BAY GOES TO NEW ORLEANS
[ct=7544.541] NEXT WEEK AND THEN BALTIMORE
[ct=7545.894] COMES TO TAMPA.
[ct=7550.266] KIRK: DO YOU RUN HERE OR GO HIGH
[ct=7553.121] PERCENTAGE PASS JUST TO MAKE HIM
[ct=7553.400] USE THAT TIMEOUT?
[ct=7555.473] THE LAST TIMEOUT.
[ct=7561.880] AL: KEEP IT ON THE GROUND.
[ct=7561.880] MAKE HIM USE THAT TIMEOUT.
[ct=7567.158] IRVING STOPPED AT THE LINE OF
[ct=7571.142] THE FINAL TIMEOUT TAKEN WITH
[ct=7571.142] 1:21.
[ct=7576.417] THE JETS ARE IN LONDON WITH

[ct=7622.561] GETTING LOOSE.
[ct=7623.989] TRENTON GO FOR THE PUNT.

[ct=7637.055] BOUNCES AND TAKES A GOOD BOUNCE
[ct=7641.050] ROLES INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=7644.619] SO THE FALCONS, EVERY GAME HAS
[ct=7645.678] BEEN A ONE POSSESSION GAME.
[ct=7648.201] THEY LOST TO THE STEELERS IN
[ct=7649.808] WEEK ONE.
[ct=7653.152] ONE POINT WIN.
[ct=7654.101] THERE IT WAS.
[ct=7658.169] AGAINST THE EAGLES, LOSING BY
[ct=7658.466] FIVE IN A TIGHT ONE AGAINST
[ct=7664.991] LAST WEEK, 58 YARD.
[ct=7664.991] DIDN'T SCORE AN OFFENSIVE
[ct=7666.341] TOUCHDOWN BUT STILL ONE THE
[ct=7668.993] KIRK: SURPRISING THING IS
[ct=7670.311] THEY'VE BEEN GETTING PRESSURED
[ct=7672.962] THE LAST COUPLE SERIES WITHOUT
[ct=7674.330] DIALING UP A LOT OF BLITZES.
[ct=7675.595] THEY'VE BEEN RELYING ON THE
[ct=7676.944] FRONT END IS BEEN WORKING OUT
[ct=7676.944] FOR THEM.
[ct=7682.255] AL: COUSINS THROWS.
[ct=7684.910] BEHIND HIM.
[ct=7686.306] HE MAKES THE GRAB.
[ct=7686.306] THAT'S FIXED.
[ct=7694.262] TACKLE OUT OF BOUNDS WITH 1:08.
[ct=7695.537] COUSINS IS 394 YARDS.
[ct=7697.774] KIRK: SEVEN RECEPTIONS ON THE

[ct=7707.102] COUSINS FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=7709.719] OPEN AIR.
[ct=7709.719] PASS THE 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=7712.384] THAT'S MOONEY.
[ct=7715.034] KIRK: GOOD JOB BETWEEN THE TWO
[ct=7716.377] LINEBACKERS BY MOONEY.
[ct=7717.683] GOES RIGHT BACK TO HIM AFTER THE
[ct=7717.683] DROP.
[ct=7720.448] THAT TIME, LOW THROW.
[ct=7721.718] HOLD ONTO IT.

[ct=7729.662] COP.
[ct=7732.368] OUT OF BOUNDS AND THEN LOSES THE
[ct=7733.643] BALL OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=7737.642] THEY RETAIN POSITION --
[ct=7737.642] POSSESSION.
[ct=7741.610] SINCE HE GOT TACKLED IN BOUNDS
[ct=7742.937] AND THRUST OUT OF BOUNDS, THE
[ct=7742.937] CLOCK KEEPS RUNNING.
[ct=7747.034] KIRK: HE THOUGHT ABOUT
[ct=7747.034] POTENTIALLY -- HE LOSES THE
[ct=7749.589] AL: RIGHT.
[ct=7752.245] HE HAS TO SPIKE IT WITH 21
[ct=7754.870] HE WAS GOING TO GET TACKLED IN
[ct=7757.561] WAS TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE
[ct=7759.960] THE CLOCK KEEPS RUNNING.
[ct=7763.177] KIRK: KIRK COUSINS ON THE LAST
[ct=7764.594] TALK ABOUT SEEING A QUARTERBACK
[ct=7767.092] THAT'S TOUGH IN THESE
[ct=7767.650] SITUATIONS.
[ct=7768.216] THIS GUY IS AS TOUGH AS THEY
[ct=7769.088] COME.
[ct=7770.375] LOGAN HALL.
[ct=7773.223] LOOK AT THIS HIT.
[ct=7774.193] HE GETS HIGH.
[ct=7776.005] LOOK AT THE THROW TO MCLEOD WHO
[ct=7776.659] HASN'T HAD MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO
[ct=7778.397] MAKE PLAYS.
[ct=7780.880] HE DIALS THEM UP THERE WITH THE
[ct=7781.328] GAME ON THE LINE.
[ct=7783.022] AL: 30 CAREER GAME-WINNING
[ct=7787.299] IN HIS YEARS WITH WASHINGTON AND
[ct=7788.904] TO ALREADY THIS YEAR.
[ct=7792.033] THIRD AND 1.
[ct=7796.320] GETTING OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=7799.038] THE CROWD WANTS THE LAKE FLAG --
[ct=7801.662] THE LATE FLAG.
[ct=7802.979] 17 SECONDS.
[ct=7806.931] KIRK: GOOD RECOGNITION.
[ct=7808.309] TAKE THE EASY OUT CUT TO LONDON.
[ct=7809.660] PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=7812.258] CLOSER AND CLOSER TO GIVING HIM
[ct=7812.258] A SHOT TO TIE THE GAME UP.
[ct=7814.966] AL: YOU WOULD BE LOOKING AT A 61
[ct=7817.595] YARD FIELD GOAL IF THEY DON'T
[ct=7817.595] GET ANOTHER YARD.
[ct=7833.103] DROPPED.
[ct=7834.547] THAT TIME IT'S MCLEOD.
[ct=7837.087] GOOD TIGHT COVERAGE THAT TIME.
[ct=7841.101] KIRK: MCCOLLUM LOOKED LIKE HE
[ct=7842.437] MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN THE HAND DAN.
[ct=7842.437] THE BALL WAS THROWN WELL.
[ct=7846.486] A LITTLE BIT BEHIND HIM.
[ct=7847.792] HE MAY HAVE GOTTEN THE LEFT-HAND
[ct=7847.792] IN THERE TO KNOCK THE FOOTBALL
[ct=7850.327] THERE IT IS.
[ct=7851.709] GOOD PLAY.
[ct=7854.353] REFEREE: TIMEOUT ON THE FIELD.
[ct=7858.311] TAMPA BAY WILL BE CHARGED WITH A
[ct=7863.638] AL: MARKEES WATTS.
[ct=7864.976] IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO THE
[ct=7864.976] CLOCK.
[ct=7869.015] JUST COST HIM A TIMEOUT.
[ct=7875.603] 58 LAST WEEK.
[ct=7875.603] HE MIGHT HAVE TO DO IT FROM EVEN
[ct=7877.017] FURTHER THIS WEEK.
[ct=7879.591] KIRK: 12 SECONDS.
[ct=7880.992] NO TIMEOUTS.
[ct=7887.540] CAME IN TONIGHT FEELING GOOD.
[ct=7888.923] HIS SECOND ATTEMPT.
[ct=7892.893] THERE HE IS FROM 54.
[ct=7899.525] AL: THOMAS WITH THE BLOCK.
[ct=7904.961] KIRK: CAREER LONG LAST WEEK FROM
[ct=7906.251] 58.
[ct=7907.526] AL: IT'S A LITTLE DICEY.
[ct=7908.899] YOU CAN'T GET TACKLED A
[ct=7910.142] AT THIS POINT.
[ct=7912.880] KIRK: THAT'S THE TRICKY PART.
[ct=7914.193] HE'S HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS
[ct=7915.522] AGAINST THE ZONES WITH THE
[ct=7915.522] UNDERNEATH THROWS.
[ct=7920.722] GET UP TO THE BALL AND FIRE TO
[ct=7923.570] YOU'RE LOOKING AT FIVE TO EIGHT
[ct=7928.862] IT'S GOT TO BE REALLY FAST.
[ct=7934.098] AL: IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, GET TO
[ct=7934.098] THE BOUNDARY.
[ct=7935.395] THEY SPREAD IT OUT HERE.
[ct=7942.217] THEY ARE GOING TO GO OVER
[ct=7943.547] 28 YARD LINE.
[ct=7947.390] CAN THEY GET IT SPIKED?
[ct=7948.751] THEY CAN.
[ct=7952.664] ONE SECOND.
[ct=7958.002] THEY GOT THE EXTRA YARDAGE.
[ct=7960.641] KIRK: THAT'S CRAZY.
[ct=7962.025] HE'S FIRED UP ABOUT WHAT HIS
[ct=7962.025] QUARTERBACK DID.
[ct=7964.770] I THOUGHT THEY GOT THE BALL DOWN
[ct=7964.770] TOO FAR.
[ct=7967.313] I THOUGHT LONDON MIGHT TAKE A
[ct=7967.313] KNEE.
[ct=7968.631] HE KEPT RUNNING.
[ct=7969.963] THE CLOCK KEPT RUNNING.
[ct=7972.602] GIVE THE OFFENSE A LOT OF
[ct=7972.602] CREDIT.
[ct=7975.298] WELL SCHOOLED.
[ct=7976.606] THEY SPREAD INTO THE LINE.
[ct=7977.969] COUSINS FIRES IT WITH ONE SECOND
[ct=7979.272] REMAINING.
[ct=7980.575] AL: TREMENDOUS.
[ct=7985.907] THIS WILL BE A 47 YARD ATTEMPT.
[ct=7991.236] HE'S HAD BETTER NIGHTS BUT HE
[ct=7992.547] CAN SALVAGE IT HERE AND SEND IT
[ct=7992.547] TO OVERTIME.
[ct=7996.508] FROM 47.
[ct=8000.504] KIRK: DELAY OF GAME.
[ct=8003.274] THEY ARE CALLING IT A DELAY OF
[ct=8005.897] AL: THEY ARE.
[ct=8008.561] REFEREE: DELAY OF GAME BY THE
[ct=8009.885] FIVE YARD PENALTY.
[ct=8016.508] AL: THE PLAY CLOCK.
[ct=8017.869] THE LAST THING
[ct=8019.240] ABOUT IS THE PLAY CLOCK.
[ct=8021.934] KIRK: THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD
[ct=8021.934] GET A RESET.
[ct=8024.498] WHY WOULD THEY BE THINKING ABOUT
[ct=8024.498] A RESET?
[ct=8028.469] >> I DON'T SEE ANY REASON TO.
[ct=8028.469] THEY GOT THE BALL DOWN.
[ct=8031.118] PLENTY OF TIME TO GET THERE
[ct=8032.474] FIELD BALL -- WEIRD GOAL TEAM
[ct=8032.474] OUT.
[ct=8037.790] NOW WE'VE GOT A TIMEOUT HERE
[ct=8039.103] FROM TAMPA.
[ct=8041.760] REFEREE: TIMEOUT TAMPA BAY.
[ct=8043.046] THIS IS A 32ND TIMEOUT.
[ct=8048.404] AL: NOW YOU GO FROM 47 TO 52.
[ct=8051.025] HE IS MADE TO TONIGHT FROM 54
[ct=8051.025] AND 48.
[ct=8056.355] MIST FROM 41 AND 54.
[ct=8060.352] DO WE GO TO OVERTIME OR DO
[ct=8061.702] HOME?
[ct=8064.345] KIRK: I'M STILL IN SHOCK HERE.
[ct=8069.673] THAT THEY WOULD PICK UP A BIG
[ct=8074.961] PLAY BY DRAKE LONDON AND THEY
[ct=8076.302] ARE CELEBRATING.
[ct=8077.620] EVERYONE IS EXCITED THINKING, WE
[ct=8078.931] WE FIRE THE BALL INTO THE
[ct=8078.931] GROUND.
[ct=8081.636] WE ARE ALL HIGH-FIVING
[ct=8082.938] OTHER.
[ct=8084.268] MEANWHILE, THE PLAY CLOCK HAS
[ct=8085.610] ALREADY STARTED.
[ct=8088.257] THERE'S NO RESET.
[ct=8089.598] THERE'S NO REASON TO RESET.
[ct=8089.598] HERE WE GO.
[ct=8094.862] EXACTLY.
[ct=8094.862] EXCITED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.
[ct=8101.489] THE FINAL PLAY OF REGULATION,
[ct=8101.489] BARRING A DEFENSIVE SOW.
[ct=8104.199] -- FOUL.
[ct=8105.544] 52 YARDS.
[ct=8112.177] AND -- OVERTIME!
[ct=8128.144] 3030 AT THE END OF REGULATION.
[ct=8132.089] KIRK: THIS IS A GREAT SHOT HERE.
[ct=8134.746] TWO WEEKS IN A ROW WITH THE GAME
[ct=8134.746] ON THE LINE.
[ct=8137.379] ONE TIME HE WINS IT, THE NEXT
[ct=8138.706] TIME HE SENDS IT INTO OVERTIME.
[ct=8141.378] RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE CLUTCH.
[ct=8141.378] MAY HAVE MISSED
[ct=8142.718] EARLIER.
[ct=8144.093] WHEN IT MATTERED, HE STEPS UP.
[ct=8146.677] LET'S NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE
[ct=8148.053] DECISION TO GO FOR IT ON FOURTH
[ct=8149.328] AND 15.
[ct=8150.685] IT WORKS OUT FOR MAURICE.
[ct=8153.314] THEY HAVE THEIR THREE TIMEOUTS.
[ct=8153.314] THEY USE THEM.
[ct=8154.638] THEY END UP GETTING THE BALL
[ct=8158.663] NO TIMEOUTS STILL DOWN THREE.
[ct=8161.343] THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID.
[ct=8162.637] REFEREE: WE WILL PLAY ONE
[ct=8166.650] OVERTIME PERIOD OF UP TO 10
[ct=8167.981] EACH TEAM WILL HAVE AN
[ct=8169.263] OPPORTUNITY TO POSSESS THE BALL
[ct=8170.621] UNLESS THE TEAM THAT POSSESSES
[ct=8179.904] AL: OFF WE GO TO OT.
[ct=8197.147] THE KICK OFF THROUGH THE END
[ct=8199.782] WHEN TAMPA BAY HAD THE BALL AT
[ct=8205.128] THE END AND IN FIELD GOAL RANGE,
[ct=8206.444] YOU HAD THE HOLDING CALL, THEY
[ct=8210.441] MISS DAY FACEMASK -- THEY MISSED
[ct=8211.746] A FACEMASK CALL.
[ct=8217.093] KIRK: YOU CAN GO BACK AND LOOK
[ct=8219.734] AT THIS, THERE ARE BIG PLAYS
[ct=8221.086] THAT GAVE ATLANTA THE SHOT THEY
[ct=8222.415] NEEDED TO GET THIS INTO
[ct=8222.415] OVERTIME.
[ct=8226.473] NOW COUSINS IS THINKING
[ct=8226.473] TOUCHDOWN, LET’
[ct=8227.773] TOUCHDOWN, LET'S GET OUT OF
[ct=8235.753] AL: 440 YARDS, 39-55.
[ct=8238.433] THE RUNNING BACK IS ALLGEIER.
[ct=8241.095] THEY START WITH HIM.
[ct=8246.381] ABOUT A YARD, SECOND AND 9.
[ct=8250.314] KIRK: THE BIG THEME IS WHAT IS
[ct=8251.680] WRONG WITH THE PASSING, WHY ARE
[ct=8251.680] THE NUMBERS DOWN?
[ct=8259.647] COUSINS WITH THE PASSING YARDS.
[ct=8266.264] AL: SECOND AND9
[ct=8267.606] AL: SECOND AND 9.
[ct=8270.260] UP TO THE 38 YARD LINE.
[ct=8276.952] COUSINS HAD THAT GAME WHERE THEY
[ct=8280.911] WERE DOWN 33-0,
[ct=8282.213] BEHIND.
[ct=8284.909] THIRD AND 3.
[ct=8288.905] CAUGHT AT THE 45 YARD LINE.
[ct=8294.178] LONDON IS SHAKEN UP.
[ct=8298.159] HE HAS NOW CAUGHT 12 TONIGHT, 13
[ct=8299.500] TARGETS FOR 154.
[ct=8302.144] INJURY TIMEOUT.
[ct=8304.857] KIRK: IT IS KIND OF AN OPTION
[ct=8306.039] ROUTE AND UP TO HIM TO FIND THE
[ct=8307.377] SOFT SPOT.
[ct=8310.030] HE DOES A PERFECT JOB OF BEING
[ct=8310.030] PATIENT.
[ct=8314.011] HE IS FEELING SOME PAIN, AND HE
[ct=8315.331] AND COUSINS, IT IS THE FIRST
[ct=8320.644] TIME THIS YEAR WE HAVE SEEN HIM
[ct=8322.003] IN SYNC AND ON TIME WITH HIS
[ct=8322.003] RECEIVERS.
[ct=8331.276] AL: A CAREER-HIGH IN PASSING
[ct=8332.570] YARDS, PASSES, 57 WITH COUSINS
[ct=8335.281] TONIGHT BUT HE WILL LOSE LONDON
[ct=8336.566] FOR AT LEAST ONE PLAY.
[ct=8343.232] MOONEY HAS CUT NINE, PITTS,
[ct=8351.232] KIRK: THIS IS WHAT FALCONS FANS
[ct=8353.830] ENVISIONED AND NFL FANS
[ct=8356.524] ENVISIONED WHEN THEY BROUGHT
[ct=8360.488] MOONEY OVER, LONDON, ROBINSON.
[ct=8365.816] JUST TAKING SOME TIME TO WORK
[ct=8367.102] INTO THIS RHYTHM.
[ct=8373.771] AL: HAJJ, #12, COMES INTO
[ct=8376.425] REPLACE LONDON FOR THE MOMENT.
[ct=8379.062] ROBINSON IS THE BACK.
[ct=8383.058] MOONEY MOVING.
[ct=8388.385] IT IS FIRED AND CAUGHT, AND THAT
[ct=8392.371] IS HODGE, AND HE WILL TAKE IT TO
[ct=8393.720] THE END ZONE.
[ct=8400.330] A MOST IMPROBABLE WIN FOR THE
[ct=8401.683] FALCONS.
[ct=8418.951] GO FIGURE.
[ct=8422.963] LONDON GETS HURT AND HAS TO COME
[ct=8422.963] OUT OF THE GAME.
[ct=8426.954] HODGE HAS NOT PLAYED MUCH
[ct=8430.942] TONIGHT, COMES IN AND SCORES.
