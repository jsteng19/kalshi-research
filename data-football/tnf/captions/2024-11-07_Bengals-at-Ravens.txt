[ct=57.430] BALL OF HIS CAREER.
[ct=64.274] 20-4, COMPLETING 70% OF PASSES
[ct=70.919] AND YOU SAW HOW UPSET HE WAS,
[ct=74.428] FIVE A PERFECTIONIST.
[ct=78.607] OUT OF THE GUN, CHASE IN MOTION
[ct=79.112] TO THE LEFT SIDE.
[ct=84.835] WITHOUT TEE HIGGINS, HE IS OUT
[ct=87.924] FOR ONE MORE GAME AND WE GET A
[ct=88.402] SEVEN YARD GAIN.
[ct=94.609] CHASE BROWN 157 SCRIMMAGE YARDS
[ct=97.185] AGAINST LAS VEGAS, SECOND DOWN
[ct=97.672] AND THREE.
[ct=102.768] KIRK: THIS IS AN EXTENSION OF
[ct=102.768] THEIR RUNNING GAME.
[ct=109.338] THEY RUN THE BALL A LOT INSIDE
[ct=110.630] ZONE COVERAGE WHICH BALTIMORE
[ct=112.019] HAS HAD SOME PROBLEMS WITH WITH
[ct=113.274] LINEBACKERS.
[ct=117.364] AL: NUMBER ONE AGAINST THE RUN.
[ct=122.586] SECOND DOWN AND THREE, PLAY
[ct=126.602] ACTION, HE STEPS UP.
[ct=131.894] CHASE HAS THE MOST OF ANY
[ct=135.946] RECEIVER AND A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=141.231] KIRK: JOE HAS PLAYED GOOD
[ct=146.669] FOOTBALL AND FOR HIM TO SAY THIS
[ct=150.637] IS THE BEST HE'S PLAYED, HE
[ct=154.635] NEEDS THE MOST CONSISTENT -- HE
[ct=157.282] MEANS THE MOST CONSISTENT ON THE
[ct=158.692] BACK HALF OF THE SEASON.
[ct=166.611] AL: FROM THE 43 UP THE MIDDLE,
[ct=169.257] NOTHING HAPPENING IN THE RAVENS
[ct=173.294] ARE NUMBER ONE AGAINST THE RUN,
[ct=175.898] STOPPING CHASE BROWN AFTER ONE
[ct=175.898] YARD, SECOND DOWN AND NINE.
[ct=181.193] KIRK: SUCH STRENGTH WITH TRAVIS
[ct=183.898] JONES HEALTHY, RODRICK
[ct=190.553] WASHINGTON, THEY CREATE THE WALL
[ct=192.023] AND FREE UP THE LINEBACKERS SO
[ct=193.200] YOU WILL NOT SEE A LOT OF THEM
[ct=194.523] RUN.
[ct=199.983] AL: FIRST YEAR COORDINATOR MIKE

[ct=239.644] HEALTHY.
[ct=244.944] A SEASON, NUMBER ONE PICK OUT OF
[ct=246.333] ALABAMA, THIRD AND NINE.
[ct=251.599] JOE BURROW STEPPING FORWARD,
[ct=251.599] THROWING, IT'S CAUGHT.
[ct=255.580] JA'MARR CHASE AT THE 50 YARD
[ct=258.301] LINE SO JOE BURROW COMING
[ct=259.575] FORWARD BEFORE HE GETS TO THE
[ct=260.933] LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, COMPLETES
[ct=260.933] THAT.
[ct=266.241] KIRK: GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHAT THEY
[ct=270.240] HAVE BEEN DOING, CHASE OFF TO
[ct=281.030] YOUR RIGHT, JOE BUYS DOWNFIELD,
[ct=282.470] CHASE IN LINE WITH THE
[ct=282.470] QUARTERBACK.
[ct=288.146] AL: GIVE IT TO BROWN ON THE
[ct=293.052] OUTSIDE, PICKS UP ONE.
[ct=298.819] GOT AWAY FROM DAVID, SECOND DOWN
[ct=299.421] , NEEDED TO.
[ct=303.464] KIRK: JOE BURROW DOES NOT GET
[ct=305.997] THE RECOGNITION FOR HIS ABILITY
[ct=310.105] IN MANEUVERING, THE FUNDAMENTALS
[ct=312.887] WHEN HE MOVES, TO HANDS ON THE
[ct=313.190] FOOTBALL.
[ct=322.506] UNDERRATED ATHLETE.
[ct=327.763] AL: BROWN THROUGH THE MIDDLE
[ct=331.410] RUNS INTO PURPLE SHIRTS, THIRD
[ct=333.831] DOWN AND FOUR ON THE OPENING
[ct=338.476] DRIVE, TANGLES HAVE PICKED UP
[ct=343.766] THE TEMPO, THIRD AND FOUR AND
[ct=346.431] NOW JOE BURROW WILL SLOW DOWN.
[ct=353.097] KIRK: HE SAID POSSESSIONS WILL
[ct=357.035] BE LIMITED, CANNOT SETTLE, WE
[ct=357.035] HAVE TO SCORE TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=365.008] AL: TAKES THE PLAY CLOCK DOWN TO
[ct=368.982] SIX SECONDS IN THE POCKET, OPEN,
[ct=371.674] TAKING IT INTO THE FIVE YARD
[ct=377.042] LINE, SECOND YEAR OUT OF
[ct=378.327] PRINCETON, SECOND AND GOAL.
[ct=384.982] KIRK: HE WORKS OVER THE MIDDLE,
[ct=386.315] CINCINNATI GOES OUT AND A GREAT
[ct=395.692] THROW, GREAT THROW.
[ct=402.557] AL: PLAYS FOR TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=406.343] JOE BURROW LOOKS LEFT, THROWS
[ct=406.765] THERE.
[ct=421.033] TWO TOUCHDOWNS AGAINST THE
[ct=421.033] RAIDERS.
[ct=437.363] KIRK: HE IS A TOUGH MATCH SHOW,
[ct=443.969] LAMAR WANTS TO THROW THE FLAG.
[ct=446.681] WE SAW HIM TALKING TO THE
[ct=446.681] OFFICIAL.
[ct=447.481] WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT IS A
[ct=447.769] CATCH.
[ct=451.830] USES THE FLAG EARLY ON FIVE
[ct=453.240] MINUTES INTO THE GAME, CATCH WAS
[ct=453.532] GOOD.
[ct=456.750] THE NEED IS DOWN.
[ct=459.562] IT APPEARS TO HAVE CONTROL IN
[ct=463.706] THE BALL COMES OUT AS HAMILTON
[ct=464.284] MAKES THE TACKLE ON THE
[ct=464.511] SIDELINE.
[ct=469.512] NOT RIGHT.
[ct=475.021] >> AFTER REVIEW, IT IS A CATCH.
[ct=482.261] AL: MOST INTERESTING ASPECT IS
[ct=482.561] THE CHALLENGE.
[ct=488.478] SECOND AND GOAL REGARDLESS, YOU
[ct=488.478] TELL ME.
[ct=491.318] SECOND DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=495.538] JOE BURROW TO THE END ZONE,
[ct=495.905] INCOMPLETE.
[ct=500.676] CHASE COVERED BY HUMPHREY, THIRD
[ct=500.978] DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=504.310] KIRK: GREAT MATCHUP MAN TO MAN.
[ct=507.092] HUMPHREY GETS CHASE.
[ct=517.200] HE SAID CHASE IS A RUNNING BACK
[ct=519.888] PLAYING WIDE RECEIVER, HE CAN
[ct=526.248] AL: HERE COMES THE 11TH PLAY OF
[ct=527.085] THE OPENING DRIVE.
[ct=536.370] AND A TIMEOUT TAKEN HERE BY
[ct=538.974] BALTIMORE, MAY HAVE HAD AN EXTRA
[ct=539.292] MAN ON THE FIELD.
[ct=543.921] >> BALTIMORE TAKES IT SECOND
[ct=543.921] TIMEOUT.
[ct=551.865] AL: GOING BACK TO THE CHALLENGE,
[ct=554.034] YOU LOSE A CHALLENGE AND THAT IS
[ct=554.518] BIGGER THAN LOSING A TIMEOUT.
[ct=560.142] KIRK: ZACH IN HIS FIRST YEAR NOT
[ct=563.461] JUST CALLING THE PLAYS,
[ct=566.859] EVERYBODY IN AND OUT, A PENALTY
[ct=568.147] AND THEY DO NOT GET THAT
[ct=575.601] THE RAVENS WILL HAVE ONE OF THE
[ct=580.847] BEST DEFENSES AND AT THIS POINT
[ct=582.287] THEY HAVE NOT BEEN THAT
[ct=582.287] CONSISTENT.
[ct=591.875] AL: THIRD AND GOAL, CHASE DOWN,
[ct=592.420] BURROW THROWING IN THAT TIME
[ct=596.092] THEY GOT THE PASS THAT THEY VERY
[ct=599.169] MUCH NEEDED AND THIS DRIVE WILL
[ct=602.102] RESULT IN A FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT
[ct=605.196] 468 YARDS.
[ct=612.023] KIRK NOT SETTLING FOR FIELD
[ct=614.752] GOALS, THEY THINK THEY WILL HAVE
[ct=615.400] TO OUTSCORE LAMAR JACKSON BUT
[ct=616.425] THEY WILL NOT KICK THE FIELD
[ct=616.753] GOAL.
[ct=622.543] AL: AND WITH FOURTH AND GOAL.
[ct=626.358] CROWD RISING AS ONE.
[ct=631.442] BROWN AND SAMPLE THE TIGHT END
[ct=631.759] OVER THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=640.960] NOW BROWN IN THE SLOT, JOE
[ct=642.876] BURROW, CHASE, PRESSURE, FIRES.
[ct=647.189] UNBELIEVABLE PLAY.
[ct=650.560] TRYING TO HIT CHASE, BROWN WAS
[ct=651.444] COVERED.
[ct=656.336] OUT OF THE POCKET.
[ct=660.907] KIRK: BRANDON STEPHENS.
[ct=666.396] THAT IS WHEN THE FLAG WAS THROWN
[ct=674.328] AL: THAT IS THE GUY, IF
[ct=679.792] KIRK: CHASE WORKS INSIDE, TRIES
[ct=680.723] TO WORK HIS WAY BACK OUT.
[ct=684.647] THEY GRABBED HOLD OF HIM AS HE
[ct=685.376] TRIES TO WORK BACK TO THE
[ct=685.688] OUTSIDE.
[ct=692.022] IT WAS FOURTH-AND-GOAL, SO THEY
[ct=692.049] GET FIRST AND GOAL NOW.
[ct=694.526] AL: FROM THE 1.
[ct=698.157] LOOKING FOR THE END ZONE AND
[ct=700.601] FINDING IT -- CHASE BROWN FOR
[ct=700.927] THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=706.552] THE BENGALS COME IN AFTER
[ct=707.684] SCORING 41 AGAINST VEGAS.
[ct=715.941] REAGAN'S WON -- RAVENS
[ct=720.152] WON THE TOSS AND DEFERRED AND
[ct=721.432] THE BENGALS SAID TAKE THIS.
[ct=726.745] KIRK: THEY MET IN WEEK FIVE, IT
[ct=728.060] WENT INTO OVERTIME.
[ct=729.422] BOTH THE QUARTERBACKS PUT UP BIG
[ct=729.422] NUMBERS.
[ct=733.384] CINCINNATI CAME IN ANTICIPATING
[ct=733.384] HAVING TO SCORE TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=737.639] THEY CATCH A BREAK ON THE
[ct=737.639] DEFENSIVE HOLDING CALL.
[ct=740.793] FIVE MINUTES OFF THE CLOCK ON
[ct=740.793] THAT DRIVE.
[ct=745.206] AL: MCPHERSON FOR THE EXTRA
[ct=745.206] POINT.
[ct=750.597] WITH 9:23 TO GO IN THE OPENING
[ct=753.044] QUARTER ON THURSDAY NIGHT
[ct=755.682] FOOTBALL IN BALTIMORE, BENGALS 7
[ct=757.047] , RAVENS 0.
[ct=758.454] HT.
[ct=762.448] THEY LIKE TO SAY A PERFECT NIGHT
[ct=762.448] FOR FOOTBALL BUT THIS IS PRETT
[ct=763.671] CLOSE.
[ct=764.990] KIRK: THIS IS A PERFECT NIGHT.
[ct=771.723] AL: IT IS DRY, A BIG CROWD --
[ct=773.028] AND A VERY LIVELY ONE.
[ct=774.351] THEY WERE QUIETED BY THE BENGALS
[ct=775.624] FOR THE MOMENT.
[ct=778.279] THE RAVENS WILL GET THE BALL AT
[ct=780.925] THE 30 YARD LINE AND THAT IS
[ct=782.381] WHERE WE WILL SEE LAMAR JACKSON
[ct=782.381] GO TO WORK.
[ct=786.322] JOE BURROW SAID HE IS PLAYING
[ct=787.745] HIS BEST BALL, LAMAR JACKSON HAS
[ct=790.281] ALREADY WON TWO M.V.P. AWARDS.
[ct=794.305] LAST WEEK HE THREW AS MANY
[ct=794.305] TOUCHDOWN PASSES AS
[ct=798.320] INCOMPLETIONS AND HIS RATING WAS
[ct=800.965] PERFECT, 158.3.
[ct=803.613] KIRK: NOT JUST LAST WEEK BUT THE
[ct=803.613] ENTIRE SEASON.
[ct=807.581] 20 TOUCHDOWNS, TWO
[ct=808.911] INTERCEPTIONS.
[ct=811.671] THERE WAS A TIME WHEN HE WAS AN
[ct=814.249] ATHLETE PLAYING QUARTERBACK AND
[ct=815.514] HAPPENS TO BE ATHLETIC.
[ct=818.247] AL: HE IS FLANKED BY DERRICK
[ct=818.247] HENRY.
[ct=820.827] WHAT ASSIGNING THAT WAS.
[ct=823.565] JACKSON GOING DEEP ON THE FIRST
[ct=826.254] PLAY AND BROKEN UP AT THE 32
[ct=826.254] YARD LINE.
[ct=831.663] TRYING TO GET IT TO BATEMAN ALL
[ct=831.663] THE WAY DOWN FIELD.
[ct=834.284] CAM TAYLOR-BRITT BREAKS IT UP.
[ct=838.191] KIRK: THEY MOVE BATEMAN FROM THE
[ct=839.510] RIGHT TO THE LEFT, TRYING TO
[ct=839.510] CREATE A MATCHUP.
[ct=843.604] GET LAMAR JACKSON TO
[ct=844.832] WHAT HE HAS.
[ct=847.605] HE HAD BATEMAN BEHIND THE
[ct=847.605] COVERAGE.
[ct=850.256] TAYLOR-BRITT CAME OVER LATE AND
[ct=852.886] RECOVERED NICELY.
[ct=852.886] HE ACTUALLY GOT A
[ct=859.593] AL: THEIR NUMBER 2 RECEIVER.
[ct=862.205] ZAY FLOWERS, NUMBER 4, HE HAS
[ct=863.565] BEEN FANTASTIC.
[ct=864.919] HERE GOES HENRY.
[ct=867.754] YOU THINK HE HAS THEM STOPPED
[ct=869.131] AND HE WILL PICK UP ANOTHER
[ct=869.131] COUPLE OF YARDS.
[ct=873.092] HE TURNS A THREE YARD GAIN INTO
[ct=873.092] A SIX YARD GAIN.
[ct=875.769] THIRD DOWN AND 4.
[ct=878.373] KIRK: BALTIMORE HAS HAD THE
[ct=879.754] BENGALS' NUMBER.
[ct=884.964] LAMAR JACKSON, 9-1 AS A STARTER
[ct=884.964] AGAINST THE BENGALS.
[ct=890.365] HE GETS TO THE THIRD AND 4, YOU
[ct=893.014] ARE AT THE MERCY OF THE
[ct=893.014] PLAYCALLING OF T
[ct=894.322] OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR.
[ct=898.315] AL: JUSTICE HILL GETS TAKEN
[ct=898.315] DOWN.
[ct=902.277] HILL.
[ct=904.924] KIRK: WHAT A JOB.
[ct=907.641] B.J. HILL TOOK A HIT LAST WEEK.
[ct=911.579] SOME PEOPLE WONDERED HOW MUCH HE
[ct=912.981] WOULD BE ABLE TO PLAY.
[ct=915.621] HE USES HIS HANDS TO GET OFF THE
[ct=918.238] BLOCK OF THE ROOKIE
[ct=919.517] ROSENGARTEN, AND MAKES THE PLAY
[ct=920.866] IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=923.611] ONE OF PLAY BY THE INTERIOR OF
[ct=924.903] THIS BENGALS DEFENSE.
[ct=928.903] AL: THE BENGALS CONTROL IT FOR
[ct=930.377] ALMOST SIX MINUTES AND THE
[ct=931.540] RAVENS HAVE A THREE AND OUT.
[ct=938.345] JORDAN STOUT WILL PUNT DOWN TO
[ct=938.345] TRENTON IRWIN.
[ct=943.512] HE SIX YEARS IT OUT
[ct=944.935] ABOUT THE 10 YARD LINE.
[ct=948.828] KIRK: AMAZING IF YOU THINK ABOUT
[ct=951.421] HERE WE ARE, VERY CLOSE, ALMOST
[ct=956.773] THE SAME WEEK IN THE SEASON, JOE
[ct=956.773] BURROW HAD THE INJURY.
[ct=959.419] THE RIGHT WRIST.
[ct=962.325] AFTER THAT THROW HE GOES OVER TO
[ct=964.771] THE SIDELINE AND TRY TO WORK IT
[ct=964.771] OUT.
[ct=967.380] HE DID NOT MAKE A THROW, HE SAID
[ct=967.380] I AM DONE.
[ct=970.020] HE HAD SURGERY IN THE
[ct=971.419] OFF-SEASON.
[ct=972.666] TRY TO GET HIMSELF BACK.
[ct=975.361] YOU CAN SEE HOW FRUSTRATED HE
[ct=975.361] IS.
[ct=979.417] HE SAID I AM PLAYING THE BEST
[ct=979.417] FOOTBALL OF MY CAREER.
[ct=983.417] YEAR LATER.
[ct=985.977] AL: HE WAS OUT FOR THE REST OF
[ct=985.977] THE SEASON.
[ct=988.632] HE GETS HIT FROM BEHIND.
[ct=992.649] THAT TIME, OWEH -- ODAFE OWEH
[ct=995.292] KNOCKS HIM DOWN.
[ct=999.183] KIRK: CODY FORD IS IN FOR
[ct=999.183] ORLANDO BROWN.
[ct=1001.891] THEY DECIDED TO KEEP ORLANDO
[ct=1001.891] BROWN DOWN.
[ct=1007.289] LOOK AT THAT HOP, JUMP, SKIP AND
[ct=1007.289] SPEED OFF THE EDGE.
[ct=1011.211] THAT IS WHAT OWEH IS SUPPOSED TO
[ct=1012.512] BE -- THE GUY OFF THE EDGE.
[ct=1016.595] HE DELIVERS AGAINST THE BACKUP
[ct=1017.761] LEFT TACKLE, CODY FORD.
[ct=1020.549] AL: THE RAVENS GETTING A DECENT
[ct=1021.756] PASS RUSH.
[ct=1028.453] GETTING BURROW OUT OF THE POCKET
[ct=1028.453] AGAIN.
[ct=1031.157] THROWS AND IS LUCKY THAT WAS NOT

[ct=1040.567] INTERCEPTION IN LAST WEEK'S
[ct=1043.199] GAME, COULD NOT HANG ON AND IT

[ct=1053.763] HE TRIES TO MOVE PEOPLE AND GET
[ct=1053.763] SOMEONE TO HELP HIM OUT.

[ct=1079.012] FIRST TIMEOUT.
[ct=1083.038] AL: LET'S GO TO KAYLEE.
[ct=1086.926] KAYLEE: A YEAR LATER JOE BURROW
[ct=1088.281] SAID THIS IS THE BEST HE FELT
[ct=1089.651] SINCE HE TORE THAT LIGAMENT IN
[ct=1090.972] HIS RIGHT WRIST HERE IN
[ct=1090.972] BALTIMORE.
[ct=1094.972] HE TOLD US THE SCAR TISSUE
[ct=1097.622] CONTINUES TO BREAK DOWN AND HE
[ct=1097.622] IS GETTING MORE RANGE OF MOTION.
[ct=1101.631] IF YOU WATCH HIM CLOSELY ON THE
[ct=1102.986] SIDELINE, YOU CAN SEE THE
[ct=1105.559] MOMENTS HE IS INSTINCTUALLY
[ct=1106.997] MOVING AROUND TO TRY TO KEEP THE
[ct=1106.997] WRIST LOOSE.
[ct=1109.627] AL: SO FAR, SO GOOD.
[ct=1112.276] HE COMES INTO THIS GAME WITH A
[ct=1116.289] 5-1 TOUCHDOWN TO INTERCEPTION
[ct=1116.289] RATIO.
[ct=1119.070] THIRD AND 10.
[ct=1124.260] PRESSURE.
[ct=1126.935] EXTRA PRESSURE.
[ct=1128.244] FIRES, TOO HIGH.
[ct=1134.890] FLAG -- THERE IS A FLAG.
[ct=1137.585] KIRK: IT IS THE ROOKIE, NATE
[ct=1137.585] WIGGINS.
[ct=1141.597] IT IS RISKY TO LEAVE A ROOKIE
[ct=1142.887] AN ISLAND.
[ct=1145.585] REFEREE: PASS INTERFERENCE,
[ct=1147.011] DEFENSE, NUMBER 2.
[ct=1148.224] KIRK: HE GETS HELD.
[ct=1152.230] LOOK HOW CLOSE THEY CAME TO
[ct=1152.230] COMPLETING THAT.
[ct=1154.875] YOU SEE HOW FRUSTRATED JA'MARR
[ct=1157.506] CHASE IS, HE GETS THE CALL.
[ct=1161.531] AL: WIGGANS WAS THEIR NUMBER ONE
[ct=1161.531] TRAFFIC OUT OF CLEMSON.
[ct=1165.566] KIRK: THE FOURTH DOWN CALL THAT
[ct=1168.143] GIVES THEM A TOUCHDOWN, AND NOW
[ct=1170.768] PINNED BACK DEEP IN THEIR OWN
[ct=1172.115] TERRITORY AND THEY GET A CALL.
[ct=1177.517] MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR JOHN
[ct=1177.517] HARBAUGH'S DEFENSE.
[ct=1181.476] AL: THE CROWD DID NOT LIKE IT.
[ct=1188.089] BROWN TO THE 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=1192.058] THEY HAVE ZACK MOSS, GOT HIM
[ct=1194.775] FROM INDIANAPOLIS -- THEY LET
[ct=1200.018] JOE MIXON GO -- MOSS IS ON
[ct=1200.018] INJURED RESERVE SO BROWN HAS
[ct=1201.379] BECOME THE GUY.
[ct=1204.066] FROM CHICAGO.
[ct=1206.688] KIRK: CHASE BROWN HAS BEEN
[ct=1206.688] REALLY IMPRESSIVE.
[ct=1209.342] CATCHES THE BALL OUT OF THE
[ct=1209.342] BACKFIELD.
[ct=1214.741] HE HAD FIVE CATCHES, 30 SEVEN
[ct=1215.983] YARDS AND A TOUCHDOWN LAST WEEK
[ct=1215.983] TO GO WITH THE RUSHING YARDS.
[ct=1218.733] HE CANNOT KEEP TAKING A
[ct=1220.055] SO THAT IS WHY THEY SIGNED
[ct=1221.392] KHALIL HERBERT.
[ct=1225.357] AL: BURROW STEPS UP AND THROWS,
[ct=1226.676] THAT IS A FIRST DOWN AND THAT IS
[ct=1226.676] BROWN AGAIN.
[ct=1229.299] SCORE THE TOUCHDOWN EARLIER.
[ct=1232.015] IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US,
[ct=1234.590] CINCINNATI MARCHED DOWN THE
[ct=1236.078] FIELD, 70 YARDS.
[ct=1237.352] RAVENS WIN THREE AND OUT.
[ct=1240.326] THE ENTIRE
[ct=1241.744] CONTROLLED BY CINCINNATI.
[ct=1244.207] KIRK: THERE IS A
[ct=1245.536] HERBERT, COMING OVER FROM
[ct=1246.871] CHICAGO.
[ct=1248.147] HE WAS NOT USED A LOT.
[ct=1250.805] D'ANDRE SWIFT CAME OVER.
[ct=1254.876] HERBERT MIGHT GET MORE OF AN
[ct=1256.162] OPPORTUNITY HERE IN CINCINNATI.
[ct=1262.817] AL: BROWN AGAIN.
[ct=1265.433] GOOD RUN AGAIN.
[ct=1269.404] AND A FLAG IS DOWN BACK AT THE
[ct=1269.404] 36 YARD LINE.
[ct=1272.021] KIRK: IS IT A HOLD ON
[ct=1273.372] KARRAS, THE CENTER.
[ct=1277.357] REFEREE: HOLDING, OFFENSE,
[ct=1278.696] NUMBER 64.
[ct=1280.208] 10-YARD PE
[ct=1284.157] KIRK: HE IS TRYING TO MAKE A
[ct=1284.861] REACH BLOCK.
[ct=1285.844] TOUGH TO DO.
[ct=1289.478] WORKING TO HIS LEFT, HE TRIES TO
[ct=1291.587] GET OUT IN FRONT AND THEN JUST
[ct=1293.892] ENDS UP HOLDING DOWN.
[ct=1296.044] THERE HE IS RIGHT HERE.
[ct=1301.422] HE IS OFF TO THE LEFT GAP, GETS
[ct=1302.703] HIS HANDS UP AND BRINGS THE BIG
[ct=1302.703] MAN DOWN.
[ct=1306.633] AL: BENGALS ONE OF THE BEST IN
[ct=1307.912] THE LEAGUE AT AVOIDING
[ct=1309.379] PENALTIES.
[ct=1313.210] ONLY 37 YARDS PER GAME, SECOND
[ct=1313.210] BEST IN THE NFL.
[ct=1315.944] FIRST AND 20.
[ct=1318.505] BURROW TO THE OUTSIDE, THAT IS
[ct=1318.505] CAUGHT.
[ct=1322.494] BREAKING A TACKLE AND GETTING
[ct=1323.806] ABOUT NINE IS GESICKI.
[ct=1327.824] KIRK: I THINK YOU WILL SEE MORE
[ct=1330.628] AND MORE OF THAT WITH GESICKI UP
[ct=1331.805] ON THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND
[ct=1333.190] JA'MARR CHASE STACKED BEHIND
[ct=1334.519] HIM.
[ct=1338.515] IT PUTS THE DEFENSE IN A BIND
[ct=1339.824] AND YOU FREE UP JA'MARR CHASE TO
[ct=1341.724] GIVE HIM OPTION ROUTES DEPENDING
[ct=1341.724] ON THE COVERAGE.
[ct=1345.373] THAT IS AN AREA THAT DAN
[ct=1345.736] PITCHER, THE OFFENSE OF
[ct=1347.689] COORDINATOR, HAS PUT A LOT MORE
[ct=1350.571] ON JA'MARR CHASE, GIVING HIM
[ct=1350.935] FREEDOM AT THE LINE OF
[ct=1351.262] SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=1353.858] INSTEAD OF BEING STATIONARY AT
[ct=1354.165] ONE SPOT.
[ct=1360.550] AL: THAT IS TANNER HUDSON MAKING
[ct=1360.550] THE CATCH.
[ct=1363.394] A SECONDARY HAS BEEN EXPLOITED.
[ct=1368.540] NUMBER 1 AGAINST THE RUSH, DEAD
[ct=1370.145] LAST AGAINST THE PASS.
[ct=1373.779] KIRK: TEAMS DO NOT TRY TO RUN ON
[ct=1374.132] THEM A LOT.
[ct=1376.903] YOU WILL NOT GET A LOT OF
[ct=1376.903] PRODUCTION.
[ct=1380.845] THEY ARE RELEASED OUT IN THE
[ct=1380.845] MIDDLE WITHOUT INTERIOR.
[ct=1386.116] ROQUAN SMITH ALWAYS CONTROLLING
[ct=1388.101] THE INTERIOR, AS WELL.
[ct=1389.079] TOUGH SLEDDING UP FRONT, TRY TO
[ct=1391.470] GET THE SHORT PASSING GAME
[ct=1391.490] AGAINST THE LINEBACKERS.
[ct=1396.103] AL: BENGALS RUNNING THEIR 19TH
[ct=1396.293] PLAY.
[ct=1398.894] PRESSURE AGAIN.
[ct=1403.915] BROWN MAKES A NICE BLOCK AND
[ct=1404.262] CHASE MAKES THE CATCH ALONG THE
[ct=1410.511] THEY GO FROM FIRST AND 20 TO
[ct=1413.129] THIRD AND 2, TO A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1417.202] KIRK: THAT IS A TOUGH ASK FOR A
[ct=1418.591] RUNNING BACK WHEN YOU HAVE A
[ct=1419.858] LINEBACKER LIKE ROQUAN SMITH
[ct=1420.113] COMING ON A BLITZ, CLEAN.
[ct=1422.512] BROWN PUSHES HIM OUT.
[ct=1426.439] YOU KNEW THE MOTION WITH JA'MARR
[ct=1428.519] CHASE GETTING MESSED UP AGAINST
[ct=1429.867] STEPHENS THAT JOE BURROW WAS
[ct=1429.867] GOING RIGHT THERE.
[ct=1433.875] THERE IS THE CHEMISTRY WITH 9
[ct=1433.875] AND 1.
[ct=1441.802] AL: BURROW 14 PASSES, COMPLETED
[ct=1441.802] NINE.
[ct=1443.190] UNDER FOUR MINUTES TO PLAY IN
[ct=1443.190] THE QUARTER.
[ct=1448.145] BROWN TO THE 40-YARD LINE.
[ct=1450.897] IN HIS SECOND YEAR AT OF
[ct=1450.897] ILLINOIS.
[ct=1453.624] PICKED HIM IN THE FIFTH ROUND.
[ct=1456.230] JOE MIXON WAS THE GUY, BROWN WAS
[ct=1461.573] MOSS WOULD PROBABLY BE 1 AND
[ct=1462.819] BROWN WAS GOING TO BE 1A
[ct=1464.194] NOW HE IS 1.
[ct=1466.842] KIRK: YOU CAN SEE EVEN TONIGHT
[ct=1470.855] THAT LAMAR JACKSON IS WAITING
[ct=1472.175] FOR HIS OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=1473.490] HAS NOT HAD MUCH AT ALL.
[ct=1476.151] 1:29.
[ct=1477.439] HE IS 200 10 POUNDS, HAS GREAT
[ct=1478.931] VISION.
[ct=1480.175] AL: SECOND DOWN AND 3.
[ct=1484.185] PLAY FAKE.
[ct=1485.535] PASS.
[ct=1489.504] GOING DOWN AS THE PASS GOT TO
[ct=1493.581] HIM, IOSIVAS, CANNOT PULL THAT
[ct=1493.581] ONE IN.
[ct=1494.825] IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 3.
[ct=1500.115] KIRK: I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
[ct=1501.488] WITH CINCINNATI AND JOE BURROW
[ct=1501.488] WHEN THEY GET TO NOVEMBER BUT
[ct=1502.830] THERE IS A DIFFERENT LOOK IN HIS
[ct=1506.830] EYES, IN THE HUDDLE, A DIFFERENT
[ct=1506.830] SENSE OF URGENCY.
[ct=1510.808] JOE LOOKS LIKE HE IS IN THE
[ct=1510.808] ZONE.
[ct=1516.057] WE SAW THAT AT LSU WHEN THEY WON
[ct=1518.685] THE TITLE IN 2019.
[ct=1521.359] SEPTEMBER.
[ct=1521.359] KIRK: [LAUGHTER]
[ct=1525.390] AL: HISTORICALLY THEY HAVE ME
[ct=1525.390] GETTING OFF TOO BAD STARTS.
[ct=1531.992] BURROW ESCAPES, THROWS,
[ct=1531.992] INCOMPLETE ALONG THE SIDELINE.
[ct=1534.651] LOOKING FOR A FLAG, DOES NOT GET
[ct=1535.982] ONE.
[ct=1540.025] FOURTH DOWN AND 3.
[ct=1545.285] KIRK: VAN NOY MADE HIM STEP UP.
[ct=1545.285] THEY ARE GETTING PRESSURE WITH
[ct=1546.585] FOUR.
[ct=1549.279] THAT IS A GREAT MATCHUP AGAINST
[ct=1551.974] MIMS, THE ROOKIE.
[ct=1554.582] KYLE HAMILTON DOES EVERYTHIN
[ct=1555.917] THIS DEFENSE.
[ct=1558.611] AL: ALL OVER THE PLACE.
[ct=1562.582] MEANWHILE, FROM THE 41, THEY
[ct=1563.859] MADE A FOURTH DOWN A TOUCHDOWN
[ct=1566.501] EARLIER, COMING OUT FOR A FOURTH
[ct=1566.501] AND 3.
[ct=1577.224] BURROW, DEEP DROP.
[ct=1579.789] BURROW, DOWN THE SIDELINE AND
[ct=1581.131] THAT IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=1583.881] THE COVERAGE WAS GOOD COME OF
[ct=1583.881] PRESSURE WAS PUT ON.
[ct=1586.449] THEY HAND THE BALL BACK TO THE
[ct=1590.412] RAVENS AT THE 41 YARD LINE.
[ct=1597.073] HIT A 56 YARD FIELD GOAL
[ct=1597.073] TO SEND IT INTO OVERTIME AND
[ct=1599.737] THEN A SHORT ONE TO WIN IT.
[ct=1602.387] KIRK: YOU TEASED ME ABOUT MY
[ct=1602.387] SCHEDULE.
[ct=1605.025] I USUALLY GO TO THE BENGALS HOME
[ct=1605.025] GAMES.
[ct=1610.418] REFEREE: FALSE START, OFFENSE,
[ct=1611.616] NUMBER 77.
[ct=1614.349] FIVE YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1618.387] KIRK: LET'S TAKE A LOOK WHILE WE
[ct=1619.662] HAVE A CHANCE AT OUR NEXGEN
[ct=1621.004] STATS POWERED BY AWS.
[ct=1625.020] DERRICK HENRY HAVING A CAREER
[ct=1629.502] A LOT OF PEOPLE WONDERED IF HE
[ct=1629.502] STILL HAD THE GOODS.
[ct=1632.010] LOOK AT THEM AS A TEAM.
[ct=1637.374] THEY LEAD THE LEAGUE IN YARDS
[ct=1637.374] AFTER CONTACT.
[ct=1642.670] AL: HENRY WILL BE 31 BEFORE THE
[ct=1644.053] END OF THE SEASON.
[ct=1649.446] IT IS FUNNY BECAUSE HE WANTED TO
[ct=1649.446] LEAVE TENNESSEE.
[ct=1650.676] WE WERE TALKING TO JOHN
[ct=1653.378] HARBAUGH, WHO ARE YOU COMPETING
[ct=1653.378] WITH?
[ct=1661.285] A LOT OF TEAMS FELT $8 MILLION
[ct=1662.612] WAS TOO MUCH MONEY FOR A RUNNING
[ct=1662.612] BACK.
[ct=1665.308] OF COURSE, THE COWBOY FANS ARE
[ct=1669.293] CRAZED THAT THEY DID NOT PICK
[ct=1669.293] HIM UP.
[ct=1671.929] SECOND DOWN AND 11.
[ct=1678.575] JACKSON THROWS.
[ct=1682.513] MAKING THE GRAB IS MARK ANDREWS.
[ct=1687.910] ANDREWS, THE VICTIM OF A HIP
[ct=1690.459] DROP TACKLE IN THIS GAME LAST
[ct=1690.459] YEAR AND MISSED THE REST OF THE
[ct=1693.153] SEASON, LOOKS BETTER THAN EVER.
[ct=1695.824] KIRK: IT IS GREAT TO SEE HIM
[ct=1698.432] WHAT A MATCHUP AGAINST THE
[ct=1699.822] SAFETY, JORDAN BATTLE.
[ct=1701.100] HOW ABOUT LAMAR JACKSON?
[ct=1705.037] VERY COMFORTABLE, MOVES AWAY
[ct=1705.037] FROM THE PRESSURE.
[ct=1709.099] LOOK AT THE TOUCH HE IS THROWING
[ct=1709.099] THE FOOTBALL WITH.
[ct=1711.800] HE IS NOT JUST THROWING IT WITH
[ct=1713.063] EVERYTHING HE HAS.
[ct=1715.817] AL: FROM THE 43.
[ct=1718.421] THAT PASS IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=1721.100] OUT OF THE REACH OF FLOWERS.
[ct=1723.726] WE WERE WATCHING ANDREWS BEFORE
[ct=1723.726] THE GAME.
[ct=1725.007] HE WAS PRACTICING THAT
[ct=1727.712] A HALF HOUR.
[ct=1731.664] KIRK: I SAW THAT.
[ct=1731.664] WITH SERIOUS INTENT.
[ct=1737.343] I THINK WITH LAMAR, LOOK AT THE
[ct=1738.316] PIECES AROUND HIM.
[ct=1739.741] THE REASON E
[ct=1743.731] THE REASON HE IS HAVING
[ct=1744.980] ANOTHER MBP YEAR, ANDREWS IS
[ct=1747.590] HEALTHY, RASHOD BATEMAN IS
[ct=1748.975] HEALTHY, ZAY FLOWERS IS REALLY
[ct=1750.331] COMING ALONG.
[ct=1751.637] THEY ARE SO MUCH BETTER ON THE
[ct=1751.637] EDGE.
[ct=1754.274] AL: SECOND DOWN AND 10.
[ct=1758.339] JACKSON, OUT OF THE POCKET,
[ct=1759.621] ALWAYS DANGEROUS.
[ct=1760.862] PROVES IT AGAIN.
[ct=1762.259] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1764.922] YOU THINK YOU HAVE HIM, AND YOU
[ct=1766.219] DON'T.
[ct=1774.153] HE PICKS UP 12 YARDS AND A
[ct=1774.153] FIRST.
[ct=1779.489] KIRK: YOU ARE IN NO MAN'S LAND
[ct=1780.796] AND HE IS IN SHOTGUN AND YOU DO
[ct=1780.796] NOT GET PRESSURE.
[ct=1784.822] YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO PLASTER THE
[ct=1786.183] RECEIVER, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
[ct=1786.183] DO?
[ct=1788.870] AL: GOES OUT THE SIDE DOOR.
[ct=1791.457] STOPPED AT THE LINE OF
[ct=1792.824] THAT IS KEATON MITCHELL.
[ct=1795.422] HE HAS BEEN HURT.
[ct=1796.717] A FLAG IS THROWN.
[ct=1799.418] THEY ACTIVATED MITCHELL TONIGHT.
[ct=1802.050] HIS FIRST ACTION OF THE SEASON.
[ct=1808.775] KIRK: PRATT DID NOT GET OFF THE
[ct=1810.175] FIELD IN TIME.
[ct=1814.140] REFEREE: TOO MANY MEN ON THE
[ct=1815.449] FIELD, DEFENSE.
[ct=1816.824] FIVE-YARD PENALTY.
[ct=1819.356] A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1822.408] KIRK: TRYING TO GET ENOUGH
[ct=1822.408] PERSONNEL IN.
[ct=1825.099] THEY WERE TRYING TO GET GERMAINE
[ct=1825.099] PRATT OFF.
[ct=1831.817] HE HUSTLED, BUT HE WAS A STEP
[ct=1831.817] SHORT.
[ct=1835.746] LAMAR SAID, NO, NO, WE GOT HIM.
[ct=1841.163] AL: LOU ANARUMO, DEFENSIVE
[ct=1843.762] COORDINATOR IN HIS 60 YEAR WITH
[ct=1849.030] THAT ROLE WITH -- IN HIS SIXTH
[ct=1850.342] YEAR IN THAT ROLE WITH THE
[ct=1851.650] BENGALS.
[ct=1855.634] GETS AROUND PRATT, TACKLED AFTER
[ct=1857.025] A GAIN OF 11.
[ct=1859.612] KIRK: YOU LOVE TO SEE THIS.
[ct=1863.613] I-FORMATION, OLD SCHOOL
[ct=1866.404] THEY WILL RUN THE FOOTBALL ON
[ct=1867.544] FIRST DOWN, RIGHT?
[ct=1871.625] THE BENGALS HAVE THREE
[ct=1872.938] LINEBACKERS IN THE GAME,
[ct=1875.957] EXPECTING RUN, TODD MONKEN DOES
[ct=1875.957] A GREAT JOB OF BREAKING A TREND.
[ct=1879.848] GET HIM ON THE EDGE AND GET HIM
[ct=1881.229] A CHANCE TO MAKE THE THROW ON
[ct=1881.229] THE RUN.
[ct=1882.590] SO DANGEROUS.
[ct=1886.523] AL: THE BENGALS WILL LET THE
[ct=1886.523] CLOCK RUN OUT.
[ct=1890.457] THE FIRST QUARTER WITH THE
[ct=1894.542] BENGALS LEADING THE RAVENS EAGLE
[ct=1895.857] COMMANDERS.
[ct=1899.796] WASHINGTON AT PHILADELPHIA IS
[ct=1901.101] THE GAME NEXT THURSDAY NIGHT ON
[ct=1901.101] PRIME.
[ct=1909.047] JAYDEN DANIELS, HURTS, THE WHOLE
[ct=1909.047] THING GOING ON.
[ct=1913.250] FIRST AND 10, HENRY GETS THE
[ct=1914.361] TOSS, DOWN THE SIDELINE.
[ct=1917.025] HE IS PUSHED OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=1922.417] KIRK: THE WHOLE THING IS CAN HE
[ct=1923.843] GET STARTED?
[ct=1925.096] CAN HE GET DOWNHILL?
[ct=1930.400] THE BENGALS DID A GOOD JOB UNTIL
[ct=1931.798] OVERTIME OF BOGGLING HIM
[ct=1935.821] WHEN HE DOES GET DOWNHILL, THAT
[ct=1935.821] IS WHEN THOSE INFAMOUS
[ct=1937.061] STIFF-ARMS COME,
[ct=1941.103] SAFETIES AND DEFENSIVE END
[ct=1942.381] BACKS.
[ct=1945.006] AL: HERE HE IS AGAIN.
[ct=1947.677] THAT TIME THE COVERAGE IS VERY
[ct=1953.005] NORMALLY HE GETS ROLLING, HE IS
[ct=1955.693] LIKE AN 18-WE'LLER ROLLING DOWN
[ct=1958.328] -- 18-WHEELER.
[ct=1961.115] KIRK: I GET IT EVERY WEEK.
[ct=1965.063] THAT TIME IT WAS REALLY WELL
[ct=1969.039] PLAYED BY SAM HUBBARD,
[ct=1969.039] CONTROLLING THE EDGE.
[ct=1971.776] THEY GET LAMAR JACKSON TO THIRD
[ct=1974.369] HAVE NOT SEEN ANY OF THE ZONE
[ct=1975.633] READ STUFF.
[ct=1976.978] THEY KIND OF SPRINKLE IT IN.
[ct=1979.648] HE DID NOT RUN THE FOOTBALL MUCH
[ct=1980.895] LAST WEEK.
[ct=1982.393] HE WAS UNDER CENTER FOR TH
[ct=1983.689] PART.
[ct=1985.041] AL: ONLY THREE CARRIES.
[ct=1987.663] FLOWERS IN MOTION, THIRD AND 4.
[ct=1990.325] HE THROWS A DART THAT IS CURRENT
[ct=1994.340] -- HE THROWS A DART THAT IS
[ct=1995.520] CAUGHT BY HILL.
[ct=1998.272] KIRK: A SLIP SCREEN.
[ct=2000.924] BY THE WAY, ANOTHER WEAPON.
[ct=2003.523] YOU TALK ABOUT HENRY AND THESE
[ct=2004.871] OTHER WEAPONS AND YOU GET A
[ct=2008.908] THIRD IN HERE COMES 43 INTO THE
[ct=2008.908] GAME AND I CANNOT FIND HIM.
[ct=2012.822] IT WAS A SIDE ARM FLIP.
[ct=2016.864] GET IT TO THE LITTLE MAN, 43.
[ct=2019.471] HE IS STRONG AND TOUGH TO BRING
[ct=2023.452] AL: FIRST AND GOAL.
[ct=2026.090] LAMAR.
[ct=2032.785] WIDE OPEN, NELSON AGHOLOR,
[ct=2032.785] TOUCHDOWN, BALTIMORE.
[ct=2040.778] JACKSON STARTS OUT LIKE HE IS
[ct=2042.228] GOING TO RUN IT, YOU HAVE TO
[ct=2043.526] THINK ABOUT THAT.
[ct=2044.836] KIRK: THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT
[ct=2049.197] THERE IS NO OFFENSE IN THE
[ct=2050.528] ENTIRE NFL THAT CHALLENGES YOU
[ct=2053.192] WITH THE EYES AS MUCH AS LAMAR
[ct=2053.192] JACKSON.
[ct=2058.523] MAKING IT LOOK AND FELL LIKE HE
[ct=2061.118] IS GOING TO RUN.
[ct=2062.519] THE SECONDARY HAS THEIR EYES IN
[ct=2063.792] THE BACKFIELD AND THEY LOSE
[ct=2066.523] FOCUS ON THE RECEIVER, AGHOLOR,
[ct=2067.931] WHO SNEAKS OUT BEHIND THEM.
[ct=2070.397] AL: JUSTIN TUCKER TO TRY TO TIE
[ct=2075.809] THE GAME, WHICH HE DOES, TWO
[ct=2077.120] MINUTES INTO THE SECOND QUARTER.
[ct=2079.726] THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL IN
[ct=2081.079] 7-7.
[ct=2087.695] KICKOFF HERE.
[ct=2091.778] TOUCHBACK TO THE 30 YARD LINE
[ct=2093.033] AND IT WILL COME.
[ct=2096.979] KAYLEE: AFTER EACH WIN, THE
[ct=2099.733] RAVENS GIVE OUT WHAT JOHN
[ct=2102.328] HARBAUGH GIVES OUT THE MOST
[ct=2103.595] PRESTIGIOUS AWARD.
[ct=2106.357] AS UNASSUMING AS IT LOOKS, ITS
[ct=2107.611] INSPIRATION IS FROM THE NAVY
[ct=2107.611] SEALS.
[ct=2112.938] HARBAUGH TAKES PRIDE IN
[ct=2114.299] RECOGNIZING THE PLAYER WHO DID
[ct=2115.539] THE DIRTY WORK TO GET THE JOB
[ct=2115.539] DONE.
[ct=2121.160] HIS FIRST AND SEVENTH SEASONS,
[ct=2126.528] LAMAR JACKSON WAS HYPED TO GET
[ct=2126.528] IT AFTER BEATING TAMPA BAY.
[ct=2130.464] AL: HERE IS THE DEBUT FOR KHALIL
[ct=2131.847] HERBERT.
[ct=2134.391] JUST CAME OVER FROM CHICAGO.
[ct=2137.170] HE DROPS THE BALL AND RECOVERS
[ct=2137.170] IT HIMSELF.
[ct=2139.685] THAT IS QUITE A DEBUT.
[ct=2143.720] THAT WOULD BE THE DEFINITION OF
[ct=2143.720] INAUSPICIOUS.
[ct=2146.343] I THINK THAT IS FAIR TO SAY.
[ct=2150.333] THE FUMBLE, I THOUGHT HE MIGHT
[ct=2151.792] ROLLUP ON ALEX CAPPA.
[ct=2154.398] THE BALL IS IN
[ct=2158.517] LIKE.
[ct=2159.807] YOU SAID, HIS FIRST OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=2162.381] THERE IS CAPPA GETTING PUSHED
[ct=2163.781] BACK ON TOP OF HIM.
[ct=2166.408] THE BALL BACK.
[ct=2169.008] AL: SECOND AND 11.
[ct=2170.319] BURROW.

[ct=2185.017] IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN 11.
[ct=2189.019] ATHLETIC ABILITY.
[ct=2191.760] GETS AWAY FROM TWO
[ct=2193.047] DEFENDERS WHO HAD HANDS ON HIM.
[ct=2194.380] OWEH HAD HIM.
[ct=2198.314] HE WAS WRAPPED UP, IT LOOKED
[ct=2198.314] LIKE HE WAS DOWN.
[ct=2200.943] THAT WAS THE HARD PART.
[ct=2203.581] THEN HE HAD A WIDE-OPEN JA'MARR
[ct=2203.581] CHASE.
[ct=2205.016] STILL GETTING PRESSURED AT THE
[ct=2208.890] END BY AR'DARIUS WASHINGTON.
[ct=2214.232] AL: BURROW NOW 50%, 9-18.
[ct=2218.302] FLANKED BY A COUPLE OF TIGHT
[ct=2219.529] ENDS IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=2220.865] THROWS TO ONE OF THEM.
[ct=2224.902] FIGHTING HIS WAY TO THE 39 YARD
[ct=2226.235] LINE IS TANNER HUDSON.
[ct=2228.938] IT WILL BE FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=2230.296] HE IS A YARD
[ct=2235.572] HAVE GONE FOR IT A COUPLE TIMES
[ct=2243.444] KIRK: THE BENGALS WILL PUNT.
[ct=2251.519] AL: THE ROOKIE PUNTER IS BRIAN
[ct=2256.780] REHKOW, OUT OF BYU.
[ct=2259.383] FREE AGENT THEY PICKED HIM UP.
[ct=2263.443] VERY HIGH KICK.
[ct=2266.068] SKY HIGH.
[ct=2270.123] FAIR CAUGHT AT THE 16 YARD LINE
[ct=2271.374] BY WALLACE.
[ct=2274.067] RAVENS WILL

[ct=2284.700] HE IS ON HIS WAY TO SURPASSING
[ct=2287.250] MICHAEL VICK FOR THE MOST
[ct=2288.708] RUSHING YARDS BUT A QUARTERBACK
[ct=2288.708] AT AGE 27.
[ct=2291.306] HE WILL BE SO FA
[ct=2292.703] EVERYONE.
[ct=2297.883] NUMBER 79.
[ct=2299.238] FIVE YARD PENALTY DOWN.
[ct=2305.853] AL: YOU USED TO SAY GRETZKY IN
[ct=2308.566] THE RECORD BOOK BUT ALEC
[ct=2313.932] BEHIND HIM.
[ct=2317.838] KIRK: FRUSTRATED GETTING BEHIND
[ct=2317.838] THE STICKS.
[ct=2321.938] AL: PLAY FAKE.
[ct=2323.187] FLOWERS.
[ct=2325.841] COVERED VERY WELL.
[ct=2328.535] KIM TAYLOR-BRITT MAKES ANOTHER
[ct=2329.900] GOOD PLAY.
[ct=2335.102] KIRK: KIM TAYLOR-BRITT -- CAM
[ct=2337.745] TAYLOR-BRITT.
[ct=2337.745] THIS IS A TOUGH ASKED.
[ct=2344.411] GOING INTO THE BOUNDARY.
[ct=2345.790] HE GETS AROUND HIM USING HIS
[ct=2345.790] QUICKNESS.
[ct=2352.412] FROM TIME TO TIME, THE SECONDARY
[ct=2353.720] IS LOOKING INTO THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=2360.357] AL: A LOSS OF FIVE.
[ct=2361.657] SECOND DOWN AND 20.

[ct=2380.236] KIRK: YOU CAN HEAR JORDAN BATTLE
[ct=2382.987] FIRED UP, THE BACKUP SAFETY,
[ct=2382.987] NUMBER 27.
[ct=2386.914] HE WENT TO ALABAMA, DERRICK
[ct=2386.914] HENRY WENT TO ALABAMA.
[ct=2390.855] HE PROBABLY WAITED A LONG TIME
[ct=2390.855] TO MAKE THAT HIT ON THE BIG
[ct=2392.597] FELLA.
[ct=2396.537] THEY CAN GET YOU BEHIND THE
[ct=2399.241] STICKS, GIVE THE DEFENSE
[ct=2400.446] CONFIDENCE AND HERE YOU ARE AT
[ct=2401.874] THIRD AND 15 ON YOUR OWN 11.
[ct=2404.492] AL: 10 MINUTES TO GO IN THE

[ct=2408.437] FIVE WIDE ON THIRD AND 15.
[ct=2411.169] QUICK THROW TO FLOWERS.
[ct=2412.554] LOOKS FOR ROOM.
[ct=2415.144] HE IS ABOUT SIX YARDS
[ct=2419.137] BATTLE MAKES THAT TACKLE.
[ct=2421.736] KIRK: THIS DEFENSE IS FLYING
[ct=2421.736] AROUND.
[ct=2427.084] CINCINNATI CAME INTO THIS GAME,
[ct=2427.084] DEFENSE HAS NOT BEEN A STRENGTH.
[ct=2431.116] HOW DO THE BENGALS WIN THIS
[ct=2431.116] GAME?
[ct=2433.929] HOW MANY STOPS WILL THEY GET ON
[ct=2435.317] LAMAR JACKSON?
[ct=2436.660] THEY WILL PRO
[ct=2437.880] OUTSCORE HIM.
[ct=2443.238] AL: JORDAN STOUT OUT TO PUNT.
[ct=2445.961] TRENTON ERWIN SETS UP INSIDE THE

[ct=2448.597] HIGH, FLOATING KICK.
[ct=2451.213] 34.
[ct=2453.945] IRWIN LOOKING FOR ROOM, THERE IS
[ct=2455.248] NONE.
[ct=2463.236] BACK COME THE BENGALS ON OFFENSE
[ct=2463.236] WITH BURROW
[ct=2468.570] AL: CINCINNATI TAKING OVER.
[ct=2475.121] WITH THE BENGALS, THEY ARE
[ct=2475.121] TAKING CARE OF THE BOTTOM
[ct=2476.509] FEEDERS.
[ct=2481.754] WINS AGAINST TEAMS THAT ARE 8-2
[ct=2481.754] 8.
[ct=2485.775] AGAINST TEAMS WITH WINNING
[ct=2485.775] RECORDS, VERY TOUGH.
[ct=2489.771] HERE COMES CHASE BROWN FOR A
[ct=2491.140] GAIN OF ABOUT FOUR.
[ct=2493.711] KIRK: BACK TO THE EARLIER PART
[ct=2496.422] OF THE SHOW, THEY SENSE AN
[ct=2501.705] OPPORTUNITY TO BEAT ONE OF THE
[ct=2503.148] TOP TEAMS IN THE LEAGUE, ON THE
[ct=2503.148] ROAD, ON A SHORT WEEK.
[ct=2505.766] COMING OFF A WIN AGAINST THE
[ct=2509.787] RAIDERS, OFF TO A SLOW START.
[ct=2512.412] HERE THEY ARE AT 4-5, A CHANCE
[ct=2516.492] TO GET TO .500 AND 2-1
[ct=2517.825] DIVISION.
[ct=2519.114] AL: SECOND AND 7.
[ct=2527.062] TIPPED AND INCOMPLETE.
[ct=2529.730] THAT TIME, KYLE HAMILTON.
[ct=2532.308] THIS GUY PLAYS ALL OVER THE
[ct=2532.308] PLACE.
[ct=2535.049] HE REMINDS YOU OF HOW
[ct=2537.589] PLAYED WITH PITTSBURGH.
[ct=2540.302] KIRK: HE IS 6'4".
[ct=2545.606] WITH THAT KIND OF LENGTH AND
[ct=2546.982] THAT ABILITY TO EXPLODE INTO THE
[ct=2549.578] BACKFIELD, THAT IS A NICE JOB OF
[ct=2549.578] DISGUISING THAT.
[ct=2553.506] LINES UP AGAINST THE TIGHT END,
[ct=2554.950] JOE WAS FOOLED.
[ct=2557.631] ABLE TO KNOCK THE FOOTBALL DOWN.
[ct=2560.207] AL: THIRD AND 7.
[ct=2566.846] STRAIGHT DROP.
[ct=2568.208] COMES UP.
[ct=2572.077] GOING TO RUN IT AND WILL BE
[ct=2574.850] TAKEN DOWN JUST SHY OF THE
[ct=2580.121] OWEH AND ROQUAN SMITH ARE THER
[ct=2581.491] THEY ARE JUSTE.
[ct=2584.102] SHY OF THE 40.
[ct=2586.748] KIRK: HE IS NOT BLINKING.
[ct=2589.402] HE IS SENDING IN THE TIGHT END
[ct=2590.718] AND CHASE BROWN.
[ct=2593.464] LAST SERIES, THEY WERE CLOSE TO
[ct=2594.720] THE SAME SPOT ON THE FIELD.
[ct=2598.694] THIS TIME WITH A HALF YARD TO
[ct=2598.694] GO, THEY ARE SENDIN
[ct=2600.086] OFFENSE.
[ct=2604.116] AL: DO THEY REALLY GO FOR IT OR
[ct=2605.476] JUST TRY TO DRAW THEM OFF SIDE?
[ct=2608.013] PLAY CLOCK AT 5.
[ct=2610.717] MEANWHILE.
[ct=2614.696] KIRK: SNAPPED IT TO TANNER
[ct=2616.079] HUDSON, WHO WENT IN MOTION.
[ct=2618.632] AL: THE LIN
[ct=2620.142] AND.
[ct=2621.559] KIRK: WOW.
[ct=2624.096] HOW ABOUT THAT?
[ct=2626.680] WOULD YOU SAY THAT IS RISKY?
[ct=2629.446] AL: I WOULD SAY.
[ct=2633.460] KIRK: WATCH HOW JOE COMMUNICATES
[ct=2633.460] TO THE SIDELINE.
[ct=2636.261] IS THAT THE CALL?
[ct=2638.737] AND THEN THE BALL IS SNAPPED TO
[ct=2641.413] ASLEEP.
[ct=2645.471] AL: GOOD SNAP BY KARRAS.
[ct=2648.054] THEY GAMBLE AND GO
[ct=2649.388] GET A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2652.311] BURROW RETREATS, A LITTLE
[ct=2652.311] FLOATER.
[ct=2655.087] BROWN HAD NO CHANCE.
[ct=2657.692] COVERAGE BY MARCUS WILLIAMS.
[ct=2662.993] KIRK: THEY ARE PLAYING ZONE
[ct=2668.337] HERE, THEIR EYES RIGHT WHERE
[ct=2668.337] THEY NEED TO BE.
[ct=2671.025] MARCUS WILLIAMS AND POSITION.
[ct=2672.323] DOES NOT GET FOOLED.
[ct=2676.283] A LITTLE HALF ROLL.
[ct=2682.913] WILLIAMS SNIFFED THAT OUT THE
[ct=2682.913] ENTIRE TIME.
[ct=2685.567] NOW THE BENGALS GO BACKWARD.
[ct=2690.915] AL: SECOND AND 15, 6:30 LEFT IN
[ct=2692.224] THE HALF.
[ct=2696.126] DROPPED.
[ct=2697.537] 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=2700.152] TANNER HUDSON.
[ct=2702.960] A FEW PLAYS AGO HE IS THE HERO.
[ct=2706.842] AND THEN A COUPLE PLAYS LATER HE
[ct=2709.424] DROPS AN EASY THROW.
[ct=2714.765] KIRK: THE BENGALS HAVE PLAYED A
[ct=2717.465] LOT OF MULTIPLE TIED NSAIDS
[ct=2718.764] WITHOUT TEE HIGGINS -- A LOT OF
[ct=2720.084] MULTIPLE TIGHT END SETS.
[ct=2725.714] IT IS IMPACTING HOW THIS OFFENSE
[ct=2725.714] CAN ATTACK.
[ct=2729.696] THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO MOVE
[ct=2731.089] HUDSON AND GESICKI INTO THIS
[ct=2732.461] GAME.
[ct=2736.369] AL: THEY HAVE TO GET TO THE 49
[ct=2736.369] OF BALTIMORE.
[ct=2740.336] BURROW ROLLING AGAINST THE
[ct=2740.336] GRAIN.
[ct=2741.703] HE IS TAKEN DOWN.
[ct=2745.677] HE DOES NOTHING, THEY WILL PUNT.
[ct=2749.699] MADUBUIKE CHASES HIM DOWN.
[ct=2751.018] FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=2753.643] KIRK: THIS IS THE GUY THEY ARE
[ct=2756.268] WAITING TO BECOME MORE VIOLENT
[ct=2757.646] IN THE PAST GAME.
[ct=2759.018] PRETTY GOOD SPEED.
[ct=2761.726] IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF HOW WELL
[ct=2765.549] HE CAN RUN FOR A 305-POUND A
[ct=2772.196] -- MAN.
[ct=2773.571] THE BALL GETS NOT LOOSE,
[ct=2776.339] GOES OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=2784.335] AL: REHKOW TO KICK AGAIN.
[ct=2789.697] WALLACE CALLS FOR A FAIR CATCH.
[ct=2792.336] AND MAKES IT THAT THE 20 YARD
[ct=2795.029] WHO HAVE SUPPORTED
[ct=2796.258] THE TEAM SINCE IT CAME TO
[ct=2797.622] BALTIMORE IN 1996.
[ct=2801.593] TUCKER TOLD ME IT PUTS THE
[ct=2802.954] PERSPECTIVE.
[ct=2805.569] AL: HE MIGHT WIND UP IN THE HALL
[ct=2806.952] OF FAME SO THE GUYS WILL BE IN
[ct=2808.307] CANTON FOR THAT INDUCTION.
[ct=2811.282] FROM THE 20 YARD LINE.
[ct=2814.868] NOT ABLE TO GET ON TRACK
[ct=2814.868] TONIGHT.
[ct=2818.943] DERRICK HENRY HAS CARRIED THE
[ct=2821.548] BALL SIX TIMES FOR 22 YARDS AND
[ct=2822.869] THE DEFENSE WILL TAKE THAT.
[ct=2825.506] KIRK: THEY DO A GOOD JOB OF
[ct=2825.506] SETTING THE EDGE.
[ct=2828.213] WHEN YOU RUN LEFT YOU HAVE TO BE
[ct=2829.454] AWARE OF TREY HENDRICKSON.
[ct=2833.530] WHEN HE AND RONNIE STANLEY GO
[ct=2836.278] HEAD TO HEAD, THIS LAST WEEK,
[ct=2837.616] FOUR SACKS.
[ct=2840.215] HE LEADS THE ENTIRE NFL WITH 11
[ct=2841.586] SACKS.
[ct=2845.496] AL: HE HAS 11 OF THEIR 17.
[ct=2849.561] QUICK THROW.
[ct=2855.099] A FIVE YARD GAIN.
[ct=2857.735] KIRK: WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON
[ct=2859.120] THIS.
[ct=2863.041] RONNIE STANLEY IS BACK HEALTHY,
[ct=2864.433] HAVING AS GOOD OF A YEAR AT LEFT
[ct=2864.433] TACKLE AS ANYONE.
[ct=2869.804] YOU DO NOT HAVE TO CHIP, YOU DO
[ct=2871.017] NOT HAVE TO PUT A TIGHT END OVER
[ct=2873.780] BALL IS GETTING OUT PRETTY
[ct=2875.365] QUICK.
[ct=2877.728] RONNIE STANLEY IS HOLDING HIS
[ct=2880.236] OWN AGAINST THE NUMBER 1 SACK
[ct=2881.732] MAN IN THE NFL.
[ct=2886.988] AL: ON A THIRD AND 5.
[ct=2893.599] DEEP DOWN THE LEFT SIDE, TWO
[ct=2897.500] RAVENS ARE THERE AND IT IS
[ct=2897.500] BROKEN UP.
[ct=2900.274] DJ TURNER BREAKING IT UP.
[ct=2902.943] KIRK: THAT BALL FLOATED A LITTLE
[ct=2902.943] BIT.
[ct=2906.904] THE GREATEST ASSET THE DJ TURNER
[ct=2908.232] HAS IS HIS SPEED.
[ct=2909.537] HE IS A 4.2 GUY.
[ct=2912.198] THIS BALL COMES OUT A LITTLE BIT
[ct=2913.518] LATE.
[ct=2914.919] LAMAR FLOATS IT.
[ct=2917.636] WATCH TURNER CATCH UP TO THE
[ct=2920.600] REALLY GOOD PLAY ON THIRD DOWN.
[ct=2925.482] I DO NOT KNOW IF HE SAW THE BALL
[ct=2926.818] BUT HE KNOCKED IT AWAY.
[ct=2932.193] AL: MEANWHILE, FOR STOUT, HIS
[ct=2933.429] THIRD PUNT OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=2937.408] THAT ONE IS OUT OF BOUNDS AT
[ct=2937.408] ABOUT THE 27 YARD LINE.
[ct=2945.405] AL: IN THAT WILD SHOOTOUT THEY
[ct=2948.052] HAD A MONTH AGO IN CINCINNATI,
[ct=2950.740] IT WAS 17-14, BENGALS, AT THE
[ct=2950.740] HALF.
[ct=2953.481] TONIGHT A DIFFERENT STORY, SO
[ct=2953.481] FAR.
[ct=2958.628] 4:02 TO GO IN THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=2961.325] BURROW HANDS THE BALL OFF.
[ct=2962.646] A GAIN OF ONE.
[ct=2967.959] CHASE BROWN HAS BEEN BUSY.
[ct=2973.250] HE HAD 27 CARRIES LAST SUNDAY.
[ct=2974.555] MEANWHILE, THERE GOES JACKSON.
[ct=2978.599] WHAT DO WE CALL IT?
[ct=2981.412] A POTTY BREAK?
[ct=2985.455] YOU CAN CALL IT THAT.
[ct=2988.049] KYLE HAMILTON WALKED UP IN THE
[ct=2990.792] BOX, PLAYING THAT DIME
[ct=2992.043] LINEBACKER SPOT.
[ct=2993.375] AL: SECOND AND 10.
[ct=2997.433] BURROW STEPPING UP, THROWS ON
[ct=2998.644] THE RUN AND THAT WILL BE HAULED
[ct=3001.437] IN FOR THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3005.588] GESICKI COMING OFF HIS BEST GAME
[ct=3005.588] AS A CINCINNATI BENGAL.
[ct=3008.264] HERE COMES LAMAR.
[ct=3012.232] KIRK: GOOD TO SEE HIM COME BACK.
[ct=3013.673] JOE BURROW CLIMBING THE POCKET,
[ct=3014.989] GESICKI IS RIGHT OVER THERE.
[ct=3017.635] WATCH HOW HE FEELS THE PRESSURE.
[ct=3020.201] WATCH GESICKI COME BACK TO THE
[ct=3024.163] THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
[ct=3025.567] THAT BALL GETTING KNOCKED DOWN
[ct=3025.567] AND A COMPLETION.
[ct=3026.915] LOOK AT BURROW
[ct=3029.499] MAKING THAT THROW.
[ct=3032.291] AL: FROM THE 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=3036.173] BROWN SHOVES HIS WAY FOR A GAI
[ct=3037.565] OF FIVE.
[ct=3041.529] KIRK: HE HAS BEEN UNDER PRESSURE
[ct=3042.808] THROUGHOUT HIS ENTIRE CAREER,
[ct=3044.070] SINCE HE HAS BEEN IN CINCINNATI.
[ct=3046.796] HE HAS A LINEBACKER MENTALITY.
[ct=3050.815] HIS FATHER, A DEFENSIVE
[ct=3052.123] COORDINATOR IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL.
[ct=3054.726] HIS BROTHER PLAYED LINEBACKER AT
[ct=3054.726] NEBRASKA.
[ct=3057.415] IT IS HIM STEPPING UP AND
[ct=3061.383] MANEUVERING, EYES DOWNFIELD,
[ct=3061.383] LOOKING FOR A CHANCE.
[ct=3064.143] JUST HAD A NICE ONE TO GESICKI.
[ct=3066.983] HE HAS A FEEL INSIDE THE POCKET
[ct=3068.211] AS GOOD AS ANYONE IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=3070.871] AL: YOU SAW HAMILTON COME UP TO
[ct=3070.871] THE LINE.
[ct=3073.528] GOES BACK INTO COVERAGE.
[ct=3076.242] SECOND DOWN AND 6.
[ct=3081.537] A NICE MOVE BY TANNER HUDSON TO
[ct=3081.537] PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3084.138] THAT TAKES US TO THE TWO-MINUTE
[ct=3084.138] WARNING.
[ct=3088.093] THAT MUCH TIME LEFT IN THE HALF,
[ct=3092.117] I LEFT EARLY.
[ct=3093.435] I HAD TO.
[ct=3096.020] HALFTIME SHOW COMING UP.
[ct=3110.680] TWO MINUTES TO THE HALF
[ct=3120.027] KIRK: PIPE OR PRESSURED --
[ct=3121.320] PIPER GETTING PRESSURED.
[ct=3123.989] THERE'S THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN
[ct=3126.530] CHASE AND JOE BURROW, ABLE TO
[ct=3127.947] WORK THAT AROUND WRITTEN
[ct=3127.947] SIMPSON.
[ct=3130.618] HE'S GETTING HIS ARMS
[ct=3133.432] STILL HAS ENOUGH ON IT TO GET
[ct=3134.631] THE BALL THERE FOR THE FIRST
[ct=3142.573] AL: BENGALS OF TWO TIMEOUTS.
[ct=3150.709] RUSHED FOR, OPEN, 30 YARD LINE,
[ct=3151.894] FIRST DOWN AND A FEW MORE.
[ct=3155.934] KIRK: KYLE HAMILTON THERE, YOU
[ct=3158.584] KNOW, YOU SAW BROWN MAKE A MOVE.
[ct=3161.282] HE WENT DOWN IMMEDIATELY.
[ct=3165.172] ONE OF THE TOP DEFENDERS IN THE
[ct=3166.541] LEAGUE LET ALONE ON THIS RAVENS
[ct=3167.904] DEFENSE.
[ct=3170.506] HE IS SITTING OUT THERE IN THE
[ct=3173.110] ZONE WITH GESICKI.
[ct=3175.881] HE WILL STARTS WANT TO REACT TO
[ct=3179.845] CHASE BROWN AND, BOY, YOU CAN
[ct=3181.155] SEE THE RIGHT LEG, THE RIGHT
[ct=3181.155] FOOT.
[ct=3189.156] AL: SO KYLE HAMILTON GETS UP,
[ct=3193.099] HOBBLES TO THE SIDELINE, AND
[ct=3193.099] HERE’
[ct=3194.398] HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.
[ct=3197.105] KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE HE STEPPED
[ct=3198.464] ON GESICKI.
[ct=3202.385] THE RIGHT FOOT, A LITTLE BIT OF
[ct=3205.098] A TWIST AFTER HE STEPPED ON IT,
[ct=3205.098] SO HE GOES INTO THE TENT.
[ct=3210.343] AL: THAT COMES WITH 69 SECONDS
[ct=3210.343] UNTIL HALFTIME.
[ct=3215.695] YOU HAVE WATSON COMING IN THAT
[ct=3219.663] ROLE SO TO SPEAK.
[ct=3225.026] MEANWHILE BURROWED TO THE END.
[ct=3226.340] AND COMPLETE.
[ct=3230.302] GESICKI GOING UP IN THE AIR.
[ct=3233.125] START.
[ct=3234.252] AL: HE DID.
[ct=3238.293] SHOT OUT OF A
[ct=3240.964] CAUGHT HIM.
[ct=3244.964] >> OFFSIDE, DEFENSE, NUMBER 99.
[ct=3250.240] KIRK: THE RIGHT GUARD GIVES THAT
[ct=3251.527] SIGNAL THAT THE OFFENSIVE LINE
[ct=3254.279] IS READY, AND HE JUMPED IT, KIND
[ct=3256.821] OF ANTICIPATING THE CENTER WOULD
[ct=3256.821] SNAP THE FOOTBALL
[ct=3259.518] THAT MOVEMENT AND HE JUST GOT
[ct=3262.267] OUT A LITTLE BIT EARLY.
[ct=3264.843] I THINK BOROUGH FELT THAT, GOT
[ct=3267.514] THAT JUMP, TRYING TO SQUEEZE IN
[ct=3267.514] AN.
[ct=3269.081] GIVES THE FIVE YARD PENALTY.
[ct=3271.586] >> FIRST AND 5.
[ct=3281.012] SERVING TO THE END ZONE.
[ct=3286.296] AND STEVENS WITH THE PICK.
[ct=3291.645] THEY GO GESICKI'S WAY AND
[ct=3292.982] THROWS ONLY HIS FIFTH
[ct=3295.826] INTERCEPTION OF THE SEASON.
[ct=3298.329] KIRK: THIS GOES TO SHOW YOU
[ct=3299.604] EVEN THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS
[ct=3302.292] CAN SOMETIMES GET CAUGHT.
[ct=3305.782] WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WITH JOE
[ct=3310.293] YOU SEE HIM SINKING STEPHENS?
[ct=3314.273] HE THINKS HE HAS MAN-TO-MAN
[ct=3315.537] COVERAGE AND A CHANCE TO GO OVER
[ct=3316.813] TOP OF HIM BUT INSTEAD HE ENDS
[ct=3318.231] UP SINKING BACK AND FOOLED JOE
[ct=3319.504] YOU HAVE TO GIVE STEPHENS
[ct=3322.222] OF CREDIT FOR THAT ONE.
[ct=3324.778] AL: SO THE PLAY IS UNDER REVIEW.
[ct=3327.381] THE QUESTION IS DOES HE STAY IN
[ct=3328.846] BOUNDS AFTER THE PICK?
[ct=3338.090] WELL, PRETTY INTERESTING.
[ct=3342.168] BACK AFTER THIS.
[ct=3353.058] >> AFTER REVIEW, THE RULING ON
[ct=3354.171] THE FIELD IS AN INCOMPLETE PASS.
[ct=3356.686] SECOND DOWN FROM THE PREVIOUS 5.
[ct=3358.031] AL: HERE IS THE SITUATION.
[ct=3360.728] BEFORE THE LEFT FOOT GETS DOWN,
[ct=3363.408] THE RIGHT FOOT IS OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=3364.717] THAT IS THE RULING.
[ct=3367.375] KIRK: THE TOW GOT DOWN BUT AS
[ct=3369.948] THE FOOT CONTINUED TO SLIDE, THE
[ct=3372.628] OUTSIDE OF THE TOE HIT THE WHITE
[ct=3374.003] BEFORE THE LEFT FOOT GOT DOWN.
[ct=3376.643] AL: CINCINNATI WITH A BALL,
[ct=3378.771] SECOND DOWN AND 5 NOW.
[ct=3381.926] BURROW, PRESSURED, UP FROM
[ct=3381.926] BEHIND.
[ct=3384.651] HE'S TAKEN DOWN.
[ct=3387.275] THE CLOCK CONTINUES TO RUN.
[ct=3388.585] THEY HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS.
[ct=3392.632] THEY ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT
[ct=3397.908] KIRK: NOW HE CALLS A TIMEOUT,
[ct=3399.222] BEING RESPECTFUL OF LAMAR
[ct=3400.597] JACKSON IN THE RAVENS OFFENSE.
[ct=3403.260] CREDIT TO THIS DEFENSIVE FRONT.
[ct=3407.242] AGAIN, THAT IS THE GUY THEY HAVE
[ct=3407.242] BEEN WAITING TO SEE.
[ct=3411.165] HE HAS BEEN A FORCE CHASING DOWN
[ct=3411.165] JOE BURROW TONIGHT.
[ct=3416.546] >> OUT OF TEXAS ANAM, FOR FEAR.
[ct=3419.160] AT A GREAT YEAR LAST YEAR.
[ct=3423.126] KIRK: THE FOURTH DOWN ON THE
[ct=3427.086] OPENING DRIVE, DEFENSIVE HOLDING
[ct=3429.757] ON FOURTH DOWN INSIDE THE 5,
[ct=3431.128] GAVE HIM A CHANCE TOGETHER
[ct=3431.128] TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=3433.760] NOW THEY HAVE IT OVERRULED WITH
[ct=3436.654] THE INTERCEPTION SO ANOTHER
[ct=3436.654] CHANCE TO CAPITALIZE ON A BREAK.
[ct=3443.315] AL: 44 SECONDS.
[ct=3448.633] BURROW FIRES, OVER THE MIDDLE,
[ct=3452.655] CAUGHT, AND THAT'S GOING TO MAKE
[ct=3453.955] IT A FIRST DOWN AND GOAL, TANNER
[ct=3453.955] HUDSON.
[ct=3456.605] THAT'S ACTUALLY JERMAINE BURTON
[ct=3457.866] WHO MAKES THE CATCH.
[ct=3460.756] BURTON MAKES THE CATCH, HIS
[ct=3460.756] FIRST GRAB OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=3464.771] THERE'S THE ROOKIE MATCHED UP
[ct=3464.771] AGAINST STEPHENS.
[ct=3467.347] BURTON.
[ct=3470.194] THERE'S NEVER A QUESTION ABOUT
[ct=3471.419] JERMAINE BURTON'S ABILITY ON THE
[ct=3475.428] FAR LEFT TO PRESS COVERAGE,
[ct=3475.428] SEPARATION.
[ct=3479.433] CONFIDENCE JOE BURROW HAS IN
[ct=3482.026] THAT BALL WAS OUT BEFORE HE MADE
[ct=3484.806] THIS CUT AND THE YOUNG ROOKIE
[ct=3488.665] DELIVERS IN THE CLUTCH HERE AND
[ct=3490.034] END ZONE.
[ct=3492.678] AL: SO IT'S GOING TO BE FIRST
[ct=3495.296] EACH TEAM IS OUT OF TIMEOUTS
[ct=3495.296] RIGHT NOW.
[ct=3499.355] SO EITHER BALTIMORE GETS THE
[ct=3499.355] BALL.
[ct=3501.973] NO TIMEOUTS TO WORK WITH.
[ct=3505.823] MEANWHILE, CINCINNATI TRYING TO
[ct=3505.823] TAKE THE LEAD BEFORE THE HALF.
[ct=3508.607] 36 SECONDS.
[ct=3511.208] KIRK: CHASE BY HIM
[ct=3512.619] LEFT, SAFETY OVERTOP.
[ct=3515.287] AL: BURROW LOOKS THAT WAY.
[ct=3519.203] IN THE END ZONE.
[ct=3523.301] ADVANTAGE, TANNER HUDSON.
[ct=3525.888] SO HUDSON, WHO TOOK THAT SNAP
[ct=3530.427] FROM CENTER AND MADE IT, MAKING
[ct=3531.617] HIS PRESENCE VERY MUCH
[ct=3533.075] FELT.
[ct=3535.744] KIRK: WHAT A JOB AS YOU WOULD
[ct=3535.744] EXPECT.
[ct=3539.812] GIVE THE OFFENSIVE LINE CREDIT
[ct=3539.812] BECAUSE JOE BURROW LOOKS LEFT TO
[ct=3541.217] JA'MARR CHASE.
[ct=3543.779] HE ENDS UP BEING DOUBLE ONCE
[ct=3546.527] HE HAS TO GET AWAY FROM THE
[ct=3547.765] TROUBLE AND FINES HUDSON,
[ct=3549.076] HAD SAT DOWN FROM THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=3553.123] AL: SO 73 YARDS TOOK THEM 3.5.
[ct=3555.842] MCPHERSON NOW FOR THE EXTRA
[ct=3565.037] AND THE BENGALS GO UP BY A SCORE
[ct=3566.342] OF 14-7.
[ct=3571.742] KIRK: MARCUS WILLIAMS ENDS UP
[ct=3572.967] DOUBLING JA'MARR CHASE.
[ct=3574.361] HIS BODY WILL TURN.
[ct=3576.966] THEY ARE JUST KIND OF BRACKETING
[ct=3579.699] LOOK AT JOE'S EYES.
[ct=3579.699] HE'S LOOKING LEFT.
[ct=3583.705] WATCH OUT HUDSON SITS IN THAT
[ct=3583.705] SOFT SPOT OF THE ZONE.
[ct=3586.303] HE IS SQUARING UP TO BURROW AND
[ct=3586.303] JUST SETTLING IN.
[ct=3590.313] A YARD OR TWO INSIDE THE GOAL
[ct=3590.313] LINE, MAKES IT AN EASY TARGET.
[ct=3594.335] SOMEHOW THE RAVENS DEFENSE LOST
[ct=3595.672] HIM, MISCOMMUNICATED,
[ct=3599.592] AL: SECOND CAREER TOUCHDOWN
[ct=3602.214] CATCH FOR HUDSON, WHO HAS BEEN
[ct=3603.552] IN THE LEAGUE FOR FIVE SEASONS.
[ct=3607.547] IT WAS ACTUALLY ON THE TAMPA BAY
[ct=3611.596] ROSTER BACK IN 2020 WHEN THEY
[ct=3611.596] WON THE SUPER BOWL.
[ct=3614.174] 14-7.
[ct=3616.905] BURROW CHECKING OUT THE TABLET.
[ct=3619.489] WHO KNOWS?
[ct=3620.858] KIRK: YOU NEVER KNOW.
[ct=3622.197] AL: HE'S A PERFECTIONIST AS WE
[ct=3623.444] MENTIONED.
[ct=3624.834] KIRK: TALK ABOUT HOW ZAC TAYLOR
[ct=3624.834] WAITED.
[ct=3627.492] LET THE CLOCK RUN A LITTLE BIT.
[ct=3630.142] JUST IN CASE YOU END UP PUTTING
[ct=3632.867] A TOUCHDOWN ON THE BOARD, YOU
[ct=3634.180] DON'T WANT TO GET BALTIMORE AND
[ct=3635.482] LAMAR JACKSON ANYTIME.
[ct=3636.786] THEY END UP GIVING HIM 30
[ct=3638.156] SECONDS.
[ct=3639.427] AL: 30 AND NO TIMEOUTS.
[ct=3643.475] KAYLEE: THE BENGALS GOT THE END
[ct=3644.768] ZONE THERE WHILE THE RAVENS JACK
[ct=3647.400] OF ALL TRADES DEFENSIVE BACK
[ct=3648.839] KYLE HAMILTON WAS IN THE X-RAY
[ct=3648.839] ROOM.
[ct=3651.513] FIELD, NOT ABLE TO PUT MUCH
[ct=3652.853] WEIGHT ON HIS LEG.
[ct=3655.466] HE'S QUESTIONABLE TO RETURN.
[ct=3656.763] AL: HUGE LOSS IF HE CANNOT COME
[ct=3659.426] KIRK: HE DOES EVERYTHING.
[ct=3662.120] HE AFFECTS THE ENTIRE DEFENSE
[ct=3664.741] BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY USE HIM.
[ct=3667.368] BACK IN THE SAFETY SPOT.
[ct=3670.122] YOU WILL HAVE TO USE TWO OR
[ct=3671.295] THREE DEFENDERS TO REPLACE ONE
[ct=3671.295] GUY.
[ct=3676.757] AL: IF THEY CAN PICK UP ENOUGH
[ct=3679.445] OF A TRUMPCARE TO SET UP OF A
[ct=3679.445] CHUNK HERE
[ct=3683.343] -- ENOUGH OF A CHUNK HERE TO SET
[ct=3684.686] UP TUCKER.
[ct=3687.309] IT TAKES ONLY FOUR SECONDS OFF
[ct=3687.309] THE CLOCK.
[ct=3690.009] SECOND AND 7.
[ct=3695.270] SO JACKSON RIGHT, 8-11, 51
[ct=3697.954] YARDS, ONLY CARRIED THE BALL ONE
[ct=3697.954] TIME TONIGHT.
[ct=3700.938] THEY WANT TO RUN THE BALL EIGHT
[ct=3700.938] TIMES, 31 YARDS.
[ct=3706.253] KIRK: WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT
[ct=3707.608] THIS DEFENSE, THE WAY THEY PLAY.
[ct=3711.584] THEIR OWN OFFENSE HAS KEPT LAMAR
[ct=3711.584] ON THE SIDELINE BUT 51 YARDS
[ct=3712.895] PASSING?
[ct=3716.839] AL: 2:1 TIME OF POSSESSION.
[ct=3719.787] KEEPING JACKSON ON THE BENCH.
[ct=3720.949] FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=3730.324] THIRD DOWN AND 7.
[ct=3734.321] CINCINNATI, WE WERE TALKING
[ct=3734.321] ABOUT THE DEFENSE.
[ct=3739.753] ONE OF THEM WAS HIGHLY SOUGHT
[ct=3739.753] AFTER.
[ct=3742.289] A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT HE WOULD
[ct=3742.289] BE A HEAD COACH.
[ct=3743.614] HE GOT SOME INTERVIEWS.
[ct=3748.936] HE WENT FROM ONE OF THE HOT
[ct=3748.936] ASSISTANCE TO A GUY UNDER THE
[ct=3751.606] GUN BECAUSE THE CINCINNATI
[ct=3752.876] AS PEOPLE WOULD EXPECT.
[ct=3755.474] KIRK: ONE OF THE TOP ASSISTANCE
[ct=3755.474] OUT THERE.
[ct=3756.897] HE'S DONE A HECKUVA JOB.
[ct=3758.219] HE'S GETTING THE
[ct=3762.174] DIALED IN TONIGHT BUT DEAFENING
[ct=3763.475] DID A COUPLE YEARS AGO.
[ct=3767.485] CLOSE ONE.
[ct=3768.844] ANDREWS GETS OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=3771.492] AND YOU HAVE A FLAG DOWN.
[ct=3775.385] STILL OUTSIDE OF FIELD GOAL
[ct=3776.809] RANGE.
[ct=3778.131] WE WILL SEE ABOUT THE PENALTY.
[ct=3782.004] >> HOLDING, DEFENSE, NUMBER 57.
[ct=3784.716] PENALTY DECLINED.
[ct=3787.371] AL: THEY WILL TAKE THE PLAY,
[ct=3788.741] WHICH IS 14 YARDS.
[ct=3791.356] SO NOW YOU ARE AT THE 47.
[ct=3795.453] FOR JUSTIN TUCKER, YOU KNOW, THE
[ct=3796.887] SKY IS THE LIMIT, NOT
[ct=3798.251] NECESSARILY THE WAY IT USED TO
[ct=3798.251] BE.
[ct=3802.135] HE'S HAD SOME ISSUES HERE WITH
[ct=3802.135] 50 YARD FIELD GOALS AND
[ct=3803.551] BEYOND.
[ct=3807.510] KIRK: HOW MUCH DO THEY WISH THEY
[ct=3808.813] HAD THOSE TWO TIMEOUTS THEY
[ct=3808.813] NEEDED TO USE?
[ct=3810.139] THEY ENDED UP HAVING 12 MEN ON
[ct=3810.139] THE FIELD.
[ct=3812.787] LET OPENING DRIVE ON DEFENSE,
[ct=3812.787] THEY BURNED TWO.
[ct=3815.385] AL: RIGHT.
[ct=3816.797] SO YOU HAVE TO WORK THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=3820.935] IF YOU WANT TO FLING A HAIL
[ct=3820.935] MARY.
[ct=3824.827] THEY WORK THE MIDDLE BUT THE
[ct=3824.827] TACKLE WAS MADE.
[ct=3830.253] DYONTAE JOHNSON RIPS THE BAL
[ct=3831.430] THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD BUT NOT
[ct=3831.430] ENOUGH TIME.
[ct=3832.797] THAT IS THE END OF IT.
[ct=3834.197] KIRK: YEAH.
[ct=3836.767] THE NICKEL MAKES A HECKUVA PLAY
[ct=3836.767] IN SPACE.
[ct=3839.320] THAT WAS A RACE TO SEE WHO WAS
[ct=3839.320] GOING TO GET THERE.
[ct=3842.030] HE GOT JOHNSON BEFORE HE COULD
[ct=3843.416] GET OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=3844.733] FLOWERS TRIED TO MAKE THE BLOCK.
[ct=3846.113] HECKUVA JOB BY THE VETERAN.
[ct=3852.693] AL: SO IT IS 14-7, BENGALS.
[ct=3858.036] KAYLEE: ZAC, YOUR OFFENSE HAS
[ct=3859.381] CONTROL A TON OF POSSESSIONS 2:
[ct=3859.381] 1.
[ct=3862.000] HALF?
[ct=3863.320] >> KEEP POSSESSING THE BALL.
[ct=3865.962] US BACK.
[ct=3869.948] WE -- OUR DEFENSE DID A
[ct=3871.276] GREAT JOB FINISHING THE HALF.
[ct=3876.607] KAYLEE: WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN
[ct=3877.870] LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF TIME
[ct=3879.310] RAVENS OFFENSE CAN EVEN BE ON
[ct=3881.923] THE FIELD, YOU STILL HAVE BEEN
[ct=3881.923] ABLE TO BOTTL
[ct=3883.282] DERRICK HENRY WHEN THEY HAD
[ct=3884.621] THEIR CHANCES.
[ct=3885.919] >> DEFENSE IS A BIG PART OF
[ct=3888.638] THEY HAVE DO THIS POINT.
[ct=3899.165] KIRK: IF YOU TOLD HIM BEFORE
[ct=3899.165] THIS GAME STARTED HE WOULD HAVE
[ct=3907.399] AL: THE RAVENS ONLY HAVE
[ct=3908.443] 102 YARDS PERIOD.
[ct=3911.097] SO THE RAVENS WILL GET THE BALL
[ct=3915.185] AS WE START THE SECOND HALF,
[ct=3919.155] OPENING GAME WITH 10, TOUCHBACK
[ct=3919.155] MOMENTS AGO.
[ct=3921.758] KAYLEE WITH JOHN HARBAUGH.
[ct=3924.476] KAYLEE: CINCINNATI CONTROLLED
[ct=3925.788] THE BALL.
[ct=3925.788] HOW DO YOU GET
[ct=3927.126] FIELD?
[ct=3929.739] >> WE HAVE TO GET THEM OFF ON
[ct=3929.739] THIRD DOWN SO FAR.
[ct=3932.421] A LITTLE TOO MUCH JOE
[ct=3932.421] SCRAMBLING.
[ct=3933.702] WE HAVE TO KEEP HIM IN.
[ct=3936.392] KAYLEE: YOUR OFFENSE ONLY HAVE
[ct=3936.392] ONE DRIVE LON
[ct=3937.708] PLAYS.
[ct=3939.054] HOW DO YOU SUSTAIN THEM?
[ct=3940.359] >> IT'S BEEN HURTING US.
[ct=3943.027] FIRST DRIVE.
[ct=3945.673] AL: INTERESTING BECAUSE LAST
[ct=3948.285] WEEK THE RAVENS SCORED ON SEVEN
[ct=3948.285] CONSECUTIVE DRIVES.
[ct=3952.313] TONIGHT A DIFFERENT STORY.
[ct=3959.028] MEANWHILE, THIS WAS GOING TO BE
[ct=3959.028] SEVENTH.
[ct=3961.669] INSTEAD IT IS JACKSON.
[ct=3965.644] AND A FLAG IS DOWN.
[ct=3969.598] BLANK MEN IS OUR REFEREE.
[ct=3973.547] >> HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER 77.
[ct=3976.223] AL: DANIEL.
[ct=3978.817] >> THAT'S A FRU
[ct=3980.160] CALL NOT JUST TO START THE HALF
[ct=3981.572] BUT IT WAS UNNECESSARY.
[ct=3985.520] LAMAR JACKSON WAS ALREADY WAY
[ct=3986.843] FROM B.J. HILL AND THE BIG
[ct=3986.843] FELLOW.
[ct=3989.474] BY THE WAY, HE’
[ct=3990.823] BY THE WAY, HE'S 410.
[ct=3996.170] PLAYED TACKLE IN COLLEGE AND
[ct=3996.170] NOW GUARD.
[ct=4001.462] AL: 410 THOUGH THEY LIST HIM AT
[ct=4001.462] 380.
[ct=4002.698] I BELIEVE YOU.
[ct=4006.701] UNDER PRESSURE.
[ct=4008.107] GETS AWAY.
[ct=4013.363] SURVEYING, RUNNING IT.
[ct=4014.697] THERE HE GOES.
[ct=4018.746] IT GETS BACK TO THE 20 YARD LINE
[ct=4018.746] AFTER ALL THAT.
[ct=4022.706] KIRK: WHEN HE CAME OUTSIDE OF
[ct=4026.653] B.J. HILL, I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,
[ct=4028.092] A HEALTHY LAMAR JACKSON TAKES
[ct=4030.630] OFF AND GETS SOME YARDS BUT, YOU
[ct=4033.328] KNOW, HE'S NOT RUNNING THE BALL
[ct=4033.328] AS MUCH THESE LAST COUPLE WEEKS.
[ct=4035.988] THERE'S YARDS THERE TO TAKE.
[ct=4040.010] GOOD JOB BY THE BENGALS.
[ct=4042.556] ANYTIME LAMAR JACKSON GETS OUT,
[ct=4043.998] HE TAKES THAT OFF, GETS DOWN THE
[ct=4045.243] RIGHT SIDELINE.
[ct=4047.931] HUGE YARDS BUT INSTEAD WE TOLD
[ct=4049.347] YOU A LITTLE
[ct=4050.573] WITH.
[ct=4053.269] AL: RUNS AROUND 35 TO GET ONE.
[ct=4055.954] SECOND AND 19.
[ct=4057.210] GOOD PROTECTION.
[ct=4061.102] FIRES AND THE RECEIVER FALLS
[ct=4063.918] DOWN, SO THAT TIME, DYONTAE
[ct=4067.870] JOHNSON -- A COUPLE YEARS AGO,
[ct=4067.870] HE'S THE NUMBER ONE RECEIVER IN
[ct=4071.956] PITTSBURGH, GOES TO CAROLINA,
[ct=4071.956] CANNOT WAIT TO GET OUT OF THERE.
[ct=4073.120] SECOND GAME N
[ct=4074.494] UNIFORM.
[ct=4077.161] KIRK: HE'S TRYING TO ADJUST
[ct=4077.161] HERE.
[ct=4079.813] HE STARTS TO RUN HIS ROUTE AND
[ct=4083.867] NOW HE SEES YOU JUST HAVE TO
[ct=4083.867] FIND THE OPEN SPOT.
[ct=4086.544] HE JUST LOSES HIS FOOTING THERE.
[ct=4087.802] THAT'S FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4090.537] AL: THIRD AND 19.
[ct=4105.062] THREE-MAN RUSH, FLAG, CAUGHT AT
[ct=4107.666] THE 25 AFTER THE 31 GOES TYLAN
[ct=4109.073] WALLACE.
[ct=4116.974] >> ILLEGAL FORMATION, OFFENSE,
[ct=4119.700] NUMBER 70, FIVE YARD PENALTY,
[ct=4119.700] REPLAY THIRD DOWN.
[ct=4123.620] KIRK: THOSE TACKLES, THEY GET
[ct=4125.016] BACK, A LITTLE TOO MUCH DEPTH.
[ct=4127.643] THAT'S WHY THEY ENDED UP CALLING
[ct=4131.573] IT IS JUST THE OPERATION OF IT.
[ct=4134.274] THAT MAKES SENSE.
[ct=4134.274] THEY WILL DECLINE IT.
[ct=4138.328] BUT THE OPERATION OF THIS HAS TO
[ct=4139.580] BE FRUSTRATING JOHN HARBAUGH.
[ct=4142.303] THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU HAVE
[ct=4142.303] WATCHED A LOT OF RAVENS TONIGHT.
[ct=4143.641] IT'S NOT THE WAY
[ct=4147.542] I MEAN, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT AN
[ct=4148.828] OFFENSE ON PACE TO BE ONE OF THE
[ct=4151.523] BEST OFFENSES IN THE HISTORY OF
[ct=4154.214] THE NFL, AVERAGING 7.13 YARDS
[ct=4156.824] PER PLAY THROUGH THE FIRST NINE
[ct=4156.824] WEEKS.
[ct=4159.448] THAT'S SECOND BEST IN THE
[ct=4162.249] HISTORY OF THE NFL, AND TONIGHT,
[ct=4163.444] A COMBINATION OF BEING OUT OF
[ct=4164.788] SYNC AND THE BENGALS
[ct=4166.173] LOT OF CREDIT FOR THE WAY THEY
[ct=4166.173] ARE PLAYING TONIGHT.
[ct=4168.797] AL: FOURTH PUNT OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=4172.795] SHORT KICK, CLEAR PAST.
[ct=4174.115] CALLED AT THE 33.
[ct=4175.802] YOU MAKE A GREAT POINT BECAUSE
[ct=4178.392] YOU HAVE TO GO BACK, YOU KNOW,
[ct=4181.084] LIKE THE GREATEST SHOW ON TURF,
[ct=4182.398] THE RAMS BACK IN 2000 AND WHAT
[ct=4183.771] THEY WERE DOING.
[ct=4186.398] OF COURSE, MARSHALL FOUGHT, KURT
[ct=4188.972] WARNER, ISAAC BRUCE.
[ct=4191.694] YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE RAVENS
[ct=4193.018] THAT ARE A TEAM THAT CAME IN
[ct=4193.018] SECOND IN
[ct=4195.627] TOTAL YARDAGE.
[ct=4198.372] KIRK: REALLY EVERY ASPECT, THIRD
[ct=4201.009] DOWN, YOU KNOW, PASSING,
[ct=4203.676] RUSHING, SO BALANCED, SO
[ct=4206.288] EXPLOSIVE, BUT TONIGHT, NOT
[ct=4207.536] HAVE THEY NOT BEEN ON THE FIELD
[ct=4210.252] A LOT BUT THEY HAVE BEEN BEHIND
[ct=4214.292] THAT LAST ONE THIRD AND 19.
[ct=4215.601] IT KNO
[ct=4216.873] FOUND THEIR RHYTHM.
[ct=4219.611] AL: AVERAGING 4.5 YARDS PER
[ct=4223.597] BURROW FIRES, CAUGHT.
[ct=4228.891] THEY WILL CHASE HIM DOWN AND
[ct=4230.202] THEY CANNOT.
[ct=4236.851] >> HOW SPECIAL IS HE WHEN HE
[ct=4236.851] GETS OUT IN THE OPEN FIELD.
[ct=4242.153] 67 YARDS FOR JA'MARR CHASE ON
[ct=4244.840] THEIR FIRST PLAY OF THE SECOND
[ct=4247.840] HALF AND THE RAVENS ARE PUT
[ct=4249.075] IN A TWO TOUCHDOWN WHOLE.
[ct=4253.095] KIRK: WATCH THE LINEBACKER PLAY,
[ct=4257.044] AND IT'S BEEN A WEAKNESS OF THIS
[ct=4257.044] BALTIMORE DEFENSE.
[ct=4259.720] GREAT JOB FROM A TIMING
[ct=4261.074] STANDPOINT AND THIS IS JUST NEXT
[ct=4262.382] LEVEL, PROBABLY BEST IN THE
[ct=4262.382] LEAGUE.
[ct=4265.045] THE RUNNING BACK STILL SAID TO
[ct=4266.402] PULL AWAY FROM THE RAVENS.
[ct=4268.977] HE DID IT IN WEEK FIVE AND
[ct=4270.425] CINCINNATI, DOES IT AGAIN HERE
[ct=4271.651] ON A THURSDAY
[ct=4272.977] BENGALS UP BY A COUPLE.
[ct=4276.949] AL: THAT'S EIGHT RECEIVING
[ct=4276.949] TOUCHDOWNS FOR CHASE.
[ct=4283.626] AL: WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT ALL DAY
[ct=4283.626] FOR NEXT THURSDAY.
[ct=4286.414] JAYDEN DANIELS, OUR FIRST LOOK
[ct=4290.283] AT HIM FOR A STORY THE PANTHERS
[ct=4292.918] HAVE BEEN THE SEASON -- THIS
[ct=4292.918] SEASON.
[ct=4295.830] JALEN HURTS IN THE EAGLES.
[ct=4298.446] PHIL LEAFY -- PHILADELPHIA
[ct=4301.093] NEXT WEEK, 8:15 P.M. EASTERN
[ct=4302.412] KICKOFF.
[ct=4307.741] SO A 14-POINT LEAD, AND AFTER
[ct=4309.021] HESITATING, NICK'S
[ct=4313.027] HESITATING, NICKX WILL COME OUT
[ct=4314.444] THE END ZONE.
[ct=4318.490] KIRK: JOE BURROW HAS BEEN
[ct=4318.490] FOCUSED AND LOCKED IN.
[ct=4321.128] WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY HERE.
[ct=4325.120] STEPS UP AGAIN, READS THE
[ct=4327.747] COVERAGE, SOFT SPOT, PUTS IT OUT
[ct=4329.128] IN FRONT OF JA'MARR CHASE, AND
[ct=4330.435] NOW IT IS AGAIN A FOOT RACE FOR
[ct=4333.034] THIS DEFENSE DOES NOT HAVE KYLE
[ct=4335.824] HAMILTON, ONE OF THE LEADERS ON
[ct=4337.013] THE BACK END, AND MAKES THEM PAY
[ct=4338.374] FOR IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF FUN
[ct=4347.654] SOME JEWELRY.
[ct=4350.458] UP THE MIDDLE GOES DEREK.
[ct=4353.061] HE HAD BEEN BOTTLED UP TONIGHT.
[ct=4355.770] MAKES OF FOUR YARDS THERE.
[ct=4358.435] HENRY HAS NO CARRIED SEVEN
[ct=4358.435] TIMES, 26 YARDS.
[ct=4363.678] KIRK: THEIR FIRST MATCHUP, THEY
[ct=4365.082] WERE DETERMINED TO STOP HIM AND
[ct=4365.082] HIS ABILITY TO RUN THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=4366.403] THEY LOADED UP.
[ct=4369.000] YOU ONLY HAVE THAT 41 YARDS
[ct=4370.364] UNTIL THEY GET INTO OVERTIME.
[ct=4378.334] AL: LONGEST RUN TONIGHT, SEVEN
[ct=4378.334] YARDS.
[ct=4391.592] AND THEY STOP HIM AGAIN.
[ct=4392.951] THIRD DOWN.
[ct=4396.926] KIRK: THAT BIG HIT WITH LOGAN
[ct=4398.347] WILSON.
[ct=4400.901] THIS DEFENSE, MAN, THEY ARE
[ct=4403.555] LOCKED IN, AND THE BETTER JOE
[ct=4404.871] BURROW PLAYS, THE
[ct=4406.240] CONFIDENCE THEY PLAY ON THEIR
[ct=4407.595] SIDE OF THE FOOTBALL, THE
[ct=4410.206] ROOKIE, MCKINNLEY JACKSON,
[ct=4411.490] TRYING TO HOLD THE POINT.
[ct=4412.877] NOT A LOT OF ROOM IN THE
[ct=4412.877] INTERIOR.
[ct=4416.849] THERE'S A BIG HIT BY 55, THE
[ct=4418.191] LEADER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
[ct=4419.487] DEFENSE, LOGAN WILSON.
[ct=4420.813] AL: THIRD AND FOUR.
[ct=4427.491] JACKSON, PRESSURES.
[ct=4431.439] HE RUNS OUT FROM BEHIND, TAKES
[ct=4432.763] THE PASS AND IT'S CAUGHT,
[ct=4435.390] BATEMAN, FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4439.458] THAT TIME HENDRICKSON ALMOST
[ct=4439.458] PICKED UP HIS 12TH SACK OF THE
[ct=4443.438] KIRK: THE BALL HAS BEEN GETTING
[ct=4443.438] OUT SO QUICKLY HE HAS NOT HAD
[ct=4446.115] MUCH OF A CHANCE TO GET AFTER
[ct=4446.115] THE QUARTERBACK.
[ct=4450.047] THERE'S THAT BEEN, THE LENGTH --
[ct=4452.688] THAT BEND, THE LENGTH COMING
[ct=4452.688] EXTENDS AND JUST MISSES IT.
[ct=4455.393] GETS HIS RIGHT HAND ON THE LEG
[ct=4457.978] BUT LAMAR JACKSON, NOT JUST THE
[ct=4459.390] ATHLETIC ABILITY BUT THE EYES
[ct=4462.013] LOCATE THE RECEIVER FOR THAT
[ct=4467.288] AL: FLOWERS.
[ct=4470.001] TO THE 50 YARD LINE.
[ct=4471.291] WE GO TO KAYLEE.
[ct=4475.321] KAYLEE: THE RAVENS DID NOT WANT
[ct=4477.849] TO HEAR KYLE HAMILTON WILL NOT
[ct=4477.849] RETURN TO THIS GAME.
[ct=4480.563] THAT ANKLE INJURY OFFICIALLY.
[ct=4481.883] AL: MM.
[ct=4485.843] THE ONLY GOOD NEWS WOULD BE HE'S
[ct=4485.843] GOT THREE EXTRA
[ct=4488.631] NEXT GAME.
[ct=4492.560] >> OFFENSE, NUMBER 65, 5-YARD
[ct=4492.560] PENALTY.
[ct=4497.927] AL: PATRICK AND CARRIE --
[ct=4503.197] PATRICK MEKARI WAS ILLEGALLY
[ct=4507.178] KIRK: THAT'S EITHER A RUN OR A
[ct=4511.128] PASS AND THAT HESITATION BECAUSE
[ct=4513.763] HE HAD TO PUMP THAT, THE
[ct=4515.176] OFFENSIVE LINEMAN, WITHOUT THE
[ct=4516.432] BALL GETTING OUT QUICKLY AND
[ct=4517.739] IT'S ANOTHER SECOND WHERE THEY
[ct=4519.132] GET ANOTHER YARD OR TWO
[ct=4520.458] DOWNFIELD SO THAT'S WHY THEY
[ct=4521.742] BROUGHT THAT ONE BACK.
[ct=4528.354] AL: FIVE WIDE.
[ct=4531.107] FIRST AND 15.
[ct=4535.152] JACKSON CANNOT GET HIM THAT
[ct=4535.152] TIME.
[ct=4536.445] THEY GET THE BALL AWAY.
[ct=4539.010] SECOND DOWN.
[ct=4543.036] JOSEPH AÇAI THAT TIME PUT THE
[ct=4544.375] HEAT ON IT.
[ct=4548.284] KIRK: YOU HAVE TO COLLAPSE THE
[ct=4548.284] POCKET TO GET TO JACKSON.
[ct=4552.319] YOU CANNOT GO UP FIELD BECAUSE
[ct=4553.638] THAT CREATES LANES FOR HIM TO
[ct=4554.992] STEP UP IN AN THAT TIME THEY
[ct=4556.279] A GOOD JOB AS A FOURSOME OF JUST
[ct=4557.582] KIND OF SQUEEZING THEM.
[ct=4560.203] ONCE AGAIN, THE RAVENS WITH THAT
[ct=4562.981] PENALTY, THAT THEME TONIGHT,
[ct=4564.274] THEY ARE THE STICKS YET AGAIN.
[ct=4568.229] AL: THERE'S BURROW, WHO HAS
[ct=4570.946] THROWN FOR 228 TONIGHT.
[ct=4574.811] JACKSON IS 91 ON 18 ATTEMPTS.
[ct=4576.227] HE WILL KEEP IT.
[ct=4581.870] AND GET UPENDED AT THE 42 YARD
[ct=4584.473] SO IT IS THIRD DOWN AND LONG.
[ct=4587.153] LAMAR, ONLY HIS THIR
[ct=4588.535] THE NIGHT.
[ct=4591.173] KIRK: TODD MONK AND IN HIS
[ct=4592.549] SECOND YEAR AS AN OFFENSIVE
[ct=4592.549] COORDINATOR.
[ct=4595.107] WE TALKED ABOUT THE NUMBERS AND
[ct=4595.107] THE JOB THEY ARE DOING.
[ct=4597.806] TONIGHT, THEY ARE TRYING TO FIND
[ct=4597.806] SOME ANSWERS.
[ct=4600.462] A BIG PART OF THAT WOULD BE NOT
[ct=4600.462] SELF-DESTRUCTING.
[ct=4603.063] SEVEN PENALTIES ON THE NIGHT.
[ct=4607.064] A LOT OF THE TIMES, AGAIN, IT'S
[ct=4609.731] PUTTING THEM BACK BEHIND, MAKING
[ct=4609.731] THEM PLAY CATCH UP ON THIR
[ct=4616.457] AL: HIS DEFENSE DOING YEOMAN
[ct=4617.747] WORK TONIGHT, THIRD DOWN AND 11.
[ct=4623.111] DEEP, DEEP DROP, PRESSURED
[ct=4627.132] AGAIN, ALL THE WAY BACK, AND
[ct=4629.710] JUST PUTS IT AWAY, CAUGHT, TAKEN
[ct=4631.020] TO THE 26 YARD LINE.
[ct=4635.082] WELL, A SOUND YOU DON'T HEAR
[ct=4637.721] OFTEN THESE DAYS AT THIS
[ct=4637.721] STADIUM.
[ct=4640.352] THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING
[ct=4640.352] ON HERE.
[ct=4643.002] THIS IS A TEAM THAT THREE TIMES
[ct=4644.358] THIS -- WHATEVER.
[ct=4648.267] THREE TIMES THIS YEAR, THIS IS A
[ct=4651.002] TEAM THAT HAS SCORED 41 POINTS
[ct=4652.240] IN THREE GAMES.
[ct=4657.622] TONIGHT, SEVEN POINTS, NOTHING
[ct=4657.622] GOING.
[ct=4660.320] CINCINNATI HAS BOTTLED THEM OUT.
[ct=4663.001] MEANTIME, STOUT IS MAKING HIS
[ct=4665.629] FIFTH PUNT OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=4671.059] TAKEN TO THE 16.
[ct=4671.059] THERE'S A FLAG.
[ct=4675.110] TO THE 17.
[ct=4677.622] IT'S A ONE RUNNING IT BACK --
[ct=4681.560] IT'S A ERWIN RUNNING IT
[ct=4689.616] KIRK: LETTING THESE GUYS KNOW
[ct=4690.902] THEY ARE STILL PLAYING GOOD
[ct=4692.240] A CHALLENGE ANYTIME Y
[ct=4693.615] AGAINST LAMAR JACKSON BUT THEY
[ct=4694.848] HAVE MET THE CHALLENGE SO FAR.
[ct=4698.826] AL: ON THE ROAD ON THREE DAYS'
[ct=4698.826] REST.
[ct=4702.947] >> AT LEAST HALF THE DISTANCE TO
[ct=4702.947] THE GOAL LINE, FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4706.930] AL: 8:58 LEFT IN THE THIRD.
[ct=4708.141] THE BENGALS ARE ON TOP.
[ct=4710.779] ING
[ct=4713.538] THE BEST BALL OF HIS CAREER, HE
[ct=4713.538] MAY JUST BE GETTING STARTED.
[ct=4718.772] AL: HE HAS ALREADY THROWN FOR
[ct=4718.772] 2:28 TONIGHT.
[ct=4722.753] A FEW MORE HERE ON A PASS OUT TO
[ct=4725.449] THE 13 YARD LINE TO TANNER
[ct=4726.773] HUDSON, SECOND AND FIVE.
[ct=4730.710] KIRK: ENDED THAT DRIVE WHEN
[ct=4730.710] JACKSON CAME OFF THE FIELD.
[ct=4734.755] HE GOT HIT BY A BUNCH OF BENGALS
[ct=4734.755] PLAYERS.
[ct=4738.683] HE W ON THE SIDELINE, TALK TO
[ct=4741.365] THE TRAINERS, FLEXING THAT RIGHT
[ct=4741.365] HAND, THAT THROWING HAND COME
[ct=4748.034] AL: THE BACKUP IS JOSH JOHNSON,
[ct=4749.439] WHO HAS BEEN AROUND SO LONG HE
[ct=4750.679] HAS PLAYED WITH 14 TIMES.
[ct=4752.007] THE RYAN FITZPATRICK OF HIS ERA.
[ct=4754.683] SECOND AND 6.
[ct=4758.581] BURROW DUMPS IT OFF, DROPPED,
[ct=4758.581] AND IT'S INCOMPLETE.
[ct=4761.342] THEY NEVER HAD CONTROL OF IT.
[ct=4763.999] THIRD DOWN AND 6.
[ct=4767.907] KIRK: JOE HAS DONE A GOOD JOB OF
[ct=4769.230] MIXING UP THOSE QUICK UNDERNEATH
[ct=4773.268] THROWS AGAINST HIS OWN DEFENSE
[ct=4774.592] AND GETTING THOSE EYES TO THE
[ct=4777.188] LINEBACKERS AND SAFETIES.
[ct=4782.574] WE SAW THAT WITH CHASE ON THAT
[ct=4786.528] LONG TOUCHDOWN SO WHICHEVER
[ct=4787.901] DIRECTION THEY TAKE AWAY, HE'S
[ct=4789.113] ABOVE IT.
[ct=4797.230] GOING TO RESET THE PLAY CLOCK.
[ct=4801.104] KIRK: IT'S RESET AT 25.
[ct=4803.865] BRINGS THEM BACK INTO THE
[ct=4806.538] HUDDLE, THIRD AND 6.
[ct=4810.419] KIRK: JA'MARR CHASE SO FAR THIS
[ct=4811.746] YEAR AGAINST THE RAVENS, 15
[ct=4815.748] RECEPTIONS, 300 12 YARDS AND
[ct=4815.748] THREE TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=4817.050] YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK HIM UP.
[ct=4827.677] AL: INTO THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=4828.996] GOES TO TANNER HUDSON.
[ct=4832.986] TANNER HUDSON, HE TOOK THAT
[ct=4835.613] SNAP, PULLED IT OVER.
[ct=4838.349] HE HAS BEEN ONE OF
[ct=4839.696] JOURNEYMEN GUYS, HAVING A
[ct=4840.962] HECKUVA NIGHT.
[ct=4843.638] KIRK: THEY LINE HIM
[ct=4844.969] JA'MARR CHASE, LET HIM GET
[ct=4846.285] DOWNFIELD.
[ct=4850.308] UNDERNEATH ZONE COVERAGE FOR THE
[ct=4852.950] RAVENS, A MAJOR PROBLEM
[ct=4854.297] BURROW JUST CAPITALIZING ON THAT
[ct=4854.297] SPACE.
[ct=4859.601] AL: HUDSON HAS CAUGHT SIX ON
[ct=4860.861] SEVEN TARGETS.
[ct=4864.921] AND AFTER THE 27 YARD LINE GOES
[ct=4864.921] CHASE BROWN.
[ct=4872.888] 27 CARRIES, 10 TONIGHT FOR 34
[ct=4876.890] THEY ALSO GAVE HIM SOME BACKUP
[ct=4876.890] HELP WITH HERBERT.
[ct=4879.487] HE FUMBLED THE LAST TIME WE SAW
[ct=4892.732] SECOND AND 5.
[ct=4900.798] THE BALL IS OUT.
[ct=4906.040] RAVENS HAVE IT.
[ct=4907.361] THEY DO.
[ct=4910.169] KNOCKED AWAY BY MARLON HUMPHREY.
[ct=4915.419] HE CREATED IT AND THEN ROADBLOCK
[ct=4916.775] SMITH, NUMBER ZERO, COMES AWAY
[ct=4916.775] WITH IT.
[ct=4922.080] KIRK: THE LEADERS, MARLON
[ct=4923.353] HUMPHREY AND ROQUAN SMITH, THEY
[ct=4924.745] HAVE TO MAKE A PLAY, AND YOU CAN
[ct=4926.237] SEE THEY ARE RIPPING THE
[ct=4930.175] GREAT JOB FOR HUMPHREY, DOING
[ct=4931.444] EXACTLY WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO,
[ct=4934.148] ATTACK THE FOOTBALL, AND THE
[ct=4938.178] VETERAN, ROQUAN SMITH, SEES IT
[ct=4938.178] THINK IT'S ON TOP OF IT.
[ct=4940.810] THAT'S A FREE BALL, ANYBODY’S
[ct=4943.428] IT BOUNCES FOR THE RAVENS.
[ct=4946.015] THEY GIVE JACKSON GREAT FIELD
[ct=4946.015] POSITION.
[ct=4950.124] AL: EXACTLY WHAT BALTIMORE
[ct=4950.124] NEEDED.
[ct=4955.365] LESS THAN SEVEN MINUTES TO GO IN
[ct=4955.365] THE THIRD.
[ct=4960.679] SO AFTER FLEXING HIS HAND ON THE
[ct=4963.331] BENCH FIRES.
[ct=4967.352] THAT WILL BE AN EIGHT YARD GAIN
[ct=4968.700] FOR BATEMAN.
[ct=4974.035] KAYLEE: IT LOOKS LIKE THE RAVENS
[ct=4974.035] HEAD ATHLETIC TRAINER WAS
[ct=4977.919] EXAMINING THE BACK OF LAMAR'S
[ct=4977.919] RIGHT THROWING HAND AND HIS
[ct=4984.644] WRIST BUT THE HE LEFT --
[ct=4987.270] THE SECOND HE LEFT HIS SIDE HE
[ct=4987.270] GAVE HIM A HANDSHAKE AND HE
[ct=4988.605] DIDN'T FLINCH.
[ct=4990.001] THAT LOOKS LIKE A GOOD
[ct=4991.180] ME HE HAD SHAKEN IT OFF.
[ct=4992.601] AL: THAT'S A HECKUVA CATCH.
[ct=4995.188] SECOND AND 2.
[ct=5004.723] TO THE 12 YARD LINE.
[ct=5007.238] HIS BEST GAIN OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=5031.222] THERE HE GOES AGAIN.
[ct=5035.209] A PASSEL OF WHITE SHIRTS IS
[ct=5036.618] THERE TO GREET HIM.
[ct=5043.189] 10 CARRIES, 40 YARDS FOR HENRY
[ct=5048.543] SECOND AND 9.
[ct=5057.844] GOT TO GO BACK TO THE END OF THE
[ct=5061.732] 2021 SEASON, LARGEST DEFICIT IN
[ct=5063.071] A HOME GAME.
[ct=5067.196] JUSTICE HILL IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=5069.767] SENDING THEM OUT TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=5072.407] JACKSON BACKING UP, BACKING
[ct=5076.404] AWAY, UNDER PRESSURE, AND DOWN
[ct=5077.661] THE SIDELINE HE GOES.
[ct=5079.125] LAMAR JACKSON.
[ct=5084.372] HE IS STOPPED INSIDE THE 1.
[ct=5088.260] NAME SOMEBOD
[ct=5089.688] CAN DO THAT.
[ct=5091.002] KIRK: NOBODY.
[ct=5092.303] NOBODY.
[ct=5096.290] AS MUCH AS HE AND THIS OFFENSE
[ct=5101.542] -- WHEN THE GAME IS ON THE LINE,
[ct=5101.542] YOU BETTER GET HIM DOWN.
[ct=5105.609] B.J. HILL WITH HIS STUNT MOVE
[ct=5105.609] HAS A CHANCE TO KEEP CONTAINED.
[ct=5109.624] ONCE HE GOT OUT OF IT, MAYBE
[ct=5110.943] SOME OF THE DEFENDERS THOUGHT HE
[ct=5112.298] WAS OUT OF BOUNDS, BUT LOOKING
[ct=5114.850] AT HIM -- LOOK AT HIM SHAKING
[ct=5114.850] PEOPLE.
[ct=5117.583] LOOK AT HILL GIVING YOU AN
[ct=5118.888] EFFORT, ANDREWS.
[ct=5122.882] AL: DO THEY GIVE IT TO HENRY?
[ct=5124.209] INDEED THEY DO.
[ct=5126.893] AND HE PASSES IT.
[ct=5130.913] SO HENRY HAS NOW SCORED A
[ct=5132.193] TOUCHDOWN IN EVERY GAME THIS
[ct=5141.455] KIRK: THAT IS COMPLEMENTARY
[ct=5142.712] FOOTBALL BY THE RAVENS.
[ct=5146.792] NOW 14 SECOND HALF, MARLON
[ct=5149.393] HUMPHREY THE VETERAN RIPS THE
[ct=5150.800] BALL OUT FROM CHASE BROWN, HECK

[ct=5205.286] HE GOES OUT OF BOUNDS TO THE 19.
[ct=5209.396] KIRK: THAT LAST SERIES, NOT ONLY
[ct=5212.035] THE TURNOVER, AND JOE BURROW, IT
[ct=5212.035] TAKES A LOT TO GET HIM KNOCKED
[ct=5214.665] OUT, BUT THIS IS A BIG HEAD ON A

[ct=5218.723] MARLON HUMPHREY, YOU
[ct=5219.960] FACIAL EXPRESSION, TAKES A BIG
[ct=5219.960] HIT.
[ct=5222.561] HE'S BACK ON THE FIELD.
[ct=5225.300] HE REACHES TO PICK THE HELMET
[ct=5225.300] UP.
[ct=5230.591] TUGGED DUDE.
[ct=5231.939] AL: YEAH.

[ct=5247.923] GAIN OF SIX.
[ct=5250.510] IN THE QUARTER.
[ct=5254.472] KIRK: INCREDIBLE WHAT ONE PLAY

[ct=5255.822] DOWN BY 14.
[ct=5258.480] BENGALS IN CONTROL WITH THE
[ct=5262.807] FOOTBALL, FUMBLED, MARLON
[ct=5265.366] HUMPHREY RIPS OUT, SMITH JUMPS

[ct=5268.045] SPECTACULAR PLAY BY LAMAR
[ct=5271.984] AND NOW THEY GET WITHIN THAT
[ct=5273.353] POSSESSION.
[ct=5281.322] HUGE SECOND AND 3.
[ct=5285.345] BOROUGH, STEPPING UP.
[ct=5286.748] BUYERS ON THE RUN.
[ct=5289.371] CHIEFS MAKE THAT CATCH UP TO THE
[ct=5293.429] DUST THEY MAKE THAT CATCH UP TO
[ct=5295.944] SIX CATCHES, 134 YARDS.
[ct=5299.948] KIRK: THE RAVENS ARE GOING
[ct=5301.377] HAVE TO START, THEY AREN'T
[ct=5301.377] GETTING A PUSH.
[ct=5304.065] THEY BROUGHT THE LINEBACKER
[ct=5306.571] SIMPSON HOW MANY TIMES TONIGHT,
[ct=5308.013] HOW MANY TIMES ALL YEAR HAVE
[ct=5309.260] WE'VE SEEN JOE BURROW WITH TWO
[ct=5310.601] HANDS ON THE FOOTBAL
[ct=5311.977] THE POCKET.
[ct=5313.310] LIKE A SMART CORNERBACK HE'S
[ct=5315.947] TRYING TO FIND THEM BECAUSE HE
[ct=5317.217] KNOWS THEY CAN COUNT ON HIM WHEN
[ct=5317.217] HE GETS ON THE MOVE LIKE THAT.
[ct=5327.992] AL: AROUND AGAIN FOR A GAME.
[ct=5333.145] SECOND DOWN AND 8.
[ct=5333.145] THEY'RE TRYING
[ct=5337.165] THEIR BEST PLAYER ON THE DEFENSE
[ct=5337.165] HAS A BOOT ON THAT RIGHT FOOT.
[ct=5341.209] AL: THE NEXT GAME IS A
[ct=5342.492] THEY GO TO PITTSBURGH IN 10
[ct=5342.492] DAYS.
[ct=5351.781] KIRK: ONE OF THE MOST
[ct=5351.781] MILD-MANNERED, LAID-BACK,
[ct=5354.446] DOMINATING, MOST VERSATILE
[ct=5354.446] PLAYERS IN
[ct=5361.087] AL: SECOND AND 8.
[ct=5363.675] HE MAKES THIS GRAB.
[ct=5367.697] ABOUT THREE YARDS OUT.
[ct=5367.697] HAMILTON, WE HAD HIM
[ct=5370.423] OTHER DAY.
[ct=5372.997] I'M THINKING TO MYSELF, THIS GUY
[ct=5374.362] IS -- CANDIDATE.
[ct=5374.362] HE’
[ct=5375.691] HE'S A REAL DEAL.
[ct=5379.642] KIRK: HIS MOM REALLY PUSHED
[ct=5379.642] ACADEMICS AND A BIG PART OF
[ct=5380.970] SPORTS.
[ct=5383.624] A BIG PART OF HIS CHILDHOOD.
[ct=5385.030] PLAYING INSTRUMENTS.
[ct=5386.322] HE GOES TO UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE
[ct=5386.322] DAME.
[ct=5391.617] AS A BRILLIANT CAREER THERE.
[ct=5392.937] VERY CEREBRAL AND TALENTED
[ct=5392.937] PLAYER.
[ct=5396.910] IS IT 6, 7, 8 HANDICAPS.
[ct=5399.567] KIND OF FRUSTRATED, HE WANTS TO
[ct=5400.925] GET BETTER.
[ct=5403.623] AL: THERE'S SOMETHI
[ct=5404.851] DO.
[ct=5406.260] THIRD AND 2.
[ct=5410.163] BOROUGH THROWS CHASE IS THERE.
[ct=5414.300] ROQUAN SMITH KNOCKS HIM OUT OF
[ct=5415.564] BOUNDS.
[ct=5418.284] PLAYING AT BOROUGH, LSU.
[ct=5422.184] BOROUGH HAS ENOUGH ROOM FOR 285.
[ct=5423.618] FOR NUMBER ONE.
[ct=5427.601] KIRK: WATCH ROQUAN SMITH.
[ct=5428.873] HE KNOWS THERE'S A CHANCE.
[ct=5431.727] HE'S POINTING IT OUT, BUT HE
[ct=5431.727] CAN'T STAY WITH HIM.
[ct=5432.888] HE'S IN NO MAN’S LAND.
[ct=5435.594] STAY WITH JA'MARR CHASE AND
[ct=5435.594] BOROUGH IS GOING TO TAKE IT OR
[ct=5439.631] RUN OR YOU START TO COME OFF OF
[ct=5440.847] THAT'S A TOUGH ASK FOR ROQUE
[ct=5444.847] WANTS -- FOR ROQUE WANT TO STAY
[ct=5444.847] WITH CHASE.
[ct=5446.220] IT'S 151 NOW IN THE NIGHT.
[ct=5449.019] AL: SEVEN CATCHES.
[ct=5452.839] BOROUGH ON HIS WAY TO 300.
[ct=5456.895] INSTEAD, HE GETS SACKED HERE,
[ct=5458.245] BACK AT THE 41 YARD LINE.
[ct=5466.273] KIRK: THEY PAID HIM BIG MONEY
[ct=5466.273] EXPECTING HIM TO DO THESE KIND
[ct=5468.932] OF THINGS AND HE'S BEEN
[ct=5471.547] CHALLENGED BY ZACH TO BECOME
[ct=5472.864] MORE VIOLENT, AND THAT'S EXACTLY
[ct=5475.576] WHAT HE DID THERE.
[ct=5476.861] HE'S ABLE TO WIN WITH THAT
[ct=5478.219] VIOLENT MENTALITY.
[ct=5480.816] HE HAS LOOKED QU
[ct=5482.221] IN THE INTERIOR.
[ct=5484.994] AL: THAT'S THREE SACKS FOR HIM
[ct=5488.808] THAT'S GOING TO TAKE US TO THE
[ct=5490.089] FINAL QUARTER.
[ct=5492.832] IT WILL BE SECOND IN 16 WHEN THE
[ct=5494.170] PLAY RESUMES AFTER THREE.
[ct=5508.764] STEELERS LEAD THE DIVISION SIX
[ct=5511.543] AND 2.
[ct=5512.805] NINE GAMES LEFT AND SIX OF THEM
[ct=5515.353] WILL BE AGAINST THE OPPOSITION.
[ct=5516.798] 21-14.
[ct=5523.366] SECOND AND 16 FOR THE BENGALS AT
[ct=5524.771] THE LTIMORE 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=5527.355] BOROUGH AGAIN.
[ct=5528.703] ROLLS AWAY.
[ct=5530.073] DUMPS IT OFF.
[ct=5538.399] LEAVING THE TEAM IN SACKS WITH
[ct=5539.750] SEVEN.
[ct=5541.079] PUT THE PRESSURE ON, THIRD DOWN.
[ct=5543.702] KIRK: THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD
[ct=5545.065] CHOP DOWNFIELD WITH COVERAGE.
[ct=5549.040] BOROUGH GOT RUSHED, BUT IT WAS
[ct=5550.433] BECAUSE HIS FIRST AND SECOND
[ct=5551.700] OPTION TAKEN AWAY.
[ct=5554.358] A LITTLE BIT MORE MAN COVERAGE.
[ct=5555.652] PLAYING A LOT OF ZONE, HE MIXED
[ct=5558.320] IN A LITTLE MAN THERE
[ct=5559.691] GOT SEPARATION.
[ct=5560.988] THEY TOOK THE DEFENSE TO GET TO
[ct=5560.988] THEM.
[ct=5572.993] BOROUGH, AGAIN PRESSURED.
[ct=5576.918] FLYERS, INCOMPLETE.
[ct=5578.279] NO FLAG.
[ct=5582.228] THAT TIME HE HAD LED DARIUS
[ct=5583.576] WASHINGTON WHO ALMOST GOT TO
[ct=5583.576] BOROUGH FOR THE SACK, F
[ct=5587.643] KIRK: HE DECIDES TO WALK.
[ct=5588.963] LOOK AT ALL THOSE PURPLE
[ct=5588.963] JERSEYS.
[ct=5590.292] WHEN YOU'RE IN OFFENSE OF LINE
[ct=5591.606] YOU ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
[ct=5592.954] FROM.
[ct=5594.279] THAT'S A TOUGH THING TO DO IN
[ct=5594.279] FRONT OF THIS CROWD.
[ct=5596.951] GAVE HIM ENOUGH ROOM TO AT LEAST
[ct=5596.951] STEP UP.
[ct=5603.538] SHAKES THAT WOULD BE SACK
[ct=5603.538] ANIMALS HITS THAT TO JA'MA
[ct=5604.924] CHASE WITH THE PRESSURE JUST
[ct=5606.279] ENOUGH THERE FOR THE RAVENS.
[ct=5611.459] AL: THIRD PART OF THE NIGHT FOR
[ct=5611.459] THE ROOKIE RYAN RICO.
[ct=5618.265] THERE CATCH CALLED FOR.
[ct=5619.468] MADE AT THE EIGHT YARD LINE BY
[ct=5619.468] TOMLIN WALLACE.
[ct=5622.207] SECONDS INTO THE FOURTH
[ct=5623.494] SEVEN POINT GAME.
[ct=5627.449] KIRK: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR
[ct=5628.840] NEXT STATS POWERED BY AWS.
[ct=5635.422] TRAVELED 58 YARDS.
[ct=5635.422] LOOK HOW PRETTY THAT IS.
[ct=5638.154] IF YOU WOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT
[ct=5644.921] INTO THE END ZONE -- 4%, SOMEHOW
[ct=5646.185] OF GAINING THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5647.553] IF ANYBODY CAN DO IT, IT'S LAMAR
[ct=5648.871] WHAT A PLAY.
[ct=5652.833] AL: TIGHT ROPING THE SIDELINE ON
[ct=5652.833] HIS WAY DOWN THERE.
[ct=5656.982] MADE IT PAY OFF AFTER THE
[ct=5656.982] TURNOVER.
[ct=5659.595] AND NOW DOW
[ct=5660.865] GO.
[ct=5663.491] START WITH THE PASS.
[ct=5663.491] SURE CAME HERE.
[ct=5667.508] GERMAINE PRATT IN ON THE TACKLE.
[ct=5672.758] KIRK: RAVENS ARE GOING TO COME
[ct=5675.505] YOU WILL SEE BATEMAN OR FLOWERS.
[ct=5675.505] SOMEBODY'S GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE
[ct=5679.493] A PLAY ON THE OUTSIDE FOR THIS
[ct=5679.493] GREAT FRIENDS -- RAVENS OFFENSE.
[ct=5684.808] MARK ANDREWS IS A SOLID PLAYER
[ct=5687.482] BUT YOU NEEDED ASTONISHING PLAY
[ct=5688.775] TO HELP LAMAR JACKSON.
[ct=5688.775] LET'S KEEP EVERYTHING IN FRONT.
[ct=5691.470] GET THOSE SAFETIES BACK.
[ct=5700.725] AL: THEY'VE DONE A GREAT JOB ON
[ct=5702.174] HIM TONIGHT.
[ct=5704.673] TAYLOR COMES UP TO STOP HIM.
[ct=5710.079] KIRK: THEY SLANT THEIR DEFENSE
[ct=5711.386] OF FRONT TO THE
[ct=5712.805] ANTICIPATING.
[ct=5715.298] THIS DEFENSE IS COMING THIS WAY.
[ct=5716.739] ALMOST ANTICIPATING THAT THEY
[ct=5717.988] WILL GO TO THAT SUITE.
[ct=5719.388] GREAT JOB BY THE CORNER.
[ct=5725.967] AL: WALLACE MAKES THE GRAB.
[ct=5727.335] WALLACE DOWN THE SIDELINE.
[ct=5730.008] WALLACE IS GOING TO GO ALL THE
[ct=5733.943] HE STAYED IN BOUNDS ALL THE WAY.
[ct=5740.634] SO ON A THIRD AND 2, TOMLIN
[ct=5741.870] WALLACE WITH A MOMENT WITH THE
[ct=5748.609] KIRK: WHICH ONE OF THESE WIDE
[ct=5748.609] RECEIVERS IS GOING TO MAKE A
[ct=5753.883] WE BROUGHT UP FLOWERS.
[ct=5756.671] INSTEAD IT'S WALLACE WHO ENDS UP
[ct=5757.878] GETTING AWAY FROM THIS DEFENSE.
[ct=5761.929] HE HAS A TACKLE.
[ct=5763.272] WILSON WITH THE STIFF-ARM.
[ct=5767.245] SAFETY, HE COMES OVER LATE.
[ct=5768.616] WHAT AN EFFORT BY TOMLIN WALLACE
[ct=5769.821] TO TAKE THAT ALL OVER THE END
[ct=5772.673] HERE'S A GREAT LOOK TO SEE IF HE
[ct=5773.871] STAYED IN BOUNDS.
[ct=5775.193] RIGHT HERE WHEN WILSON HITS
[ct=5776.572] BECAUSE VERY CLOSE.
[ct=5781.901] KIRK: THAT'S THE ONE THE
[ct=5783.114] LOOK AT.
[ct=5784.484] EVERY OTHER STEP HE TOOK IS
[ct=5785.799] CLEARLY IN BOUNDS.
[ct=5787.162] IT WAS THAT
[ct=5788.577] WAS CLOSE.
[ct=5792.464] AL: ALMOST LOOKED LIKE THE TOE
[ct=5792.464] WAS IN AND THE HEEL WAS U
[ct=5793.808] THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT
[ct=5796.904] IF IT STANDS, IT'S 84 YARDS.
[ct=5805.893] LOOK AT THIS.
[ct=5809.911] KIRK: YOU'RE RIGHT, THE TOE
[ct=5809.911] DOWN, THEY HEEL NEVER TOUCHES.
[ct=5813.952] YOU LOOK AT THAT AND YOU THINK
[ct=5816.722] THAT FOOT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ON THE
[ct=5816.722] WHITE LINE BUT THE HEEL IS
[ct=5818.091] HE'S GOOD.
[ct=5820.686] AL: TURNER WAS ALL GOOD IN TOUCH
[ct=5821.969] FOR THE POINT AFTER.
[ct=5827.309] OF ALL THE GUYS, JUSTIN TUCKER.
[ct=5828.593] WOW.
[ct=5832.658] BILL FIGURE THAT BABY OUT.
[ct=5833.979] 21-20, CINCINNATI.
[ct=5843.276] WELL, JUSTIN TUCKER ONLY MISSES
[ct=5844.605] HIS SEVEN EXTRA POINTS OUT OF
[ct=5845.896] BUT THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN
[ct=5848.626] THE GAME RIGHT NOW AS HE KICKS
[ct=5848.626] OFF.
[ct=5854.021] 21-20, BENGALS HANGING ON BY A
[ct=5855.288] THREAD.
[ct=5856.654] THEY WILL START THIS DRIVE FROM
[ct=5857.907] THE 30 YARD LINE, BACK WE GO.
[ct=5861.965] KIRK: THE DEFENSE PLAYED WELL
[ct=5863.329] TONIGHT, I JUST WONDER WHERE WAS
[ct=5864.601] THE DEFENSE ON THIS PLAY.
[ct=5865.806] WATCH THE EFFORT HERE AS IT
[ct=5867.229] SLOWS DOWN BY LOGAN
[ct=5868.675] GENO STONE.
[ct=5870.195] THEY THINK THE PLAY IS MADE,
[ct=5871.749] THEY KIND OF GIVE UP ON IT AND
[ct=5871.749] THEN THEY TAKE OFF.
[ct=5875.666] THAT SLIGHT HESITATION IS A STEP
[ct=5876.962] OR TWO PREVENTING THEM FROM AT
[ct=5878.295] THE VERY LEAST, PUSHING ALL OF
[ct=5879.595] THIS OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=5882.339] SO I THINK THEY THOUGHT THE PLAY
[ct=5883.676] WAS MADE, THEY STOPPED, AND THEN
[ct=5884.936] THEY TRIED TO TURN UP THE SPEED.
[ct=5886.177] BY THEN, IT WAS TOO LATE.
[ct=5890.171] AL: 84 YARDS, LONGEST PASSIVE
[ct=5891.571] JACKSON'S CAREER.
[ct=5896.944] BOROUGH -- BURROW.
[ct=5902.174] KAYLEE: WE WERE KEEPING AN EYE
[ct=5903.523] ON JOE BOROUGH AFTER HE TOOK
[ct=5904.842] THAT SHOT TO HIS LEFT LOWER
[ct=5904.842] RIBS.
[ct=5907.469] JUST AS YOU SAW HIM GRIMACE WHEN
[ct=5910.123] HE REACHED FOR HIS LEFT ARM
[ct=5910.123] BEFORE THEIR PREVIOUS DRIVE.
[ct=5912.765] WE SAW SOMET
[ct=5914.178] THIS TIME WHEN HE REACHED FOR
[ct=5915.455] THE HELMET WITH HIS LEFT ARM HE
[ct=5916.815] WAS REMINDING HIMSELF THAT IT
[ct=5918.117] ACTUALLY HURT AND GRIMACED.
[ct=5919.458] HE THEN HAD TO REVERT TO PICKING
[ct=5920.876] UP THE HELMET WITH HIS RIGHT ARM
[ct=5922.046] TO PUT IT ON BUT HE DID
[ct=5923.789] RECEIVE ANY MEDICAL ATTENTION
[ct=5924.911] WHILE ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=5930.228] AL: COMPLETES OUT ONE FOR 17 TO
[ct=5932.872] BROWN.
[ct=5934.231] WE WERE TALKING TO HAMILTON THE
[ct=5935.520] OTHER DAY ABOUT A TEAM PLAYER.
[ct=5938.339] WHAT'S THE BEST PLAY OF YOUR
[ct=5938.339] CAREER.
[ct=5943.612] HE SAID IT WAS RETURNED AND OVER
[ct=5944.887] TIME TO BEAT THEM LAST YEAR.
[ct=5950.234] KIRK: USUALLY IT'S LIKE IT
[ct=5951.516] MIGHT'VE BEEN THIS INTERCEPTION.
[ct=5954.083] AND HE SAID IT'S NOT EVEN IN
[ct=5956.877] HOW: BEAT THE RAMS IN OT HERE.
[ct=5959.511] IT IS CRUNCH TIME HERE UNDER
[ct=5959.511] 12:30 TO GO.
[ct=5963.504] BURROW NOW HAS THROWN FOR 304
[ct=5967.533] 25 OF 40.
[ct=5972.762] GOOD PROTECTION FOR HIM, GOOD
[ct=5979.383] COVERAGE BY THE RAVENS AS THE
[ct=5980.817] ROOKIE MAKES THAT GRAB AT THIRD
[ct=5982.184] DOWN AND SIX.
[ct=5984.714] KIRK: KEEP MIXING UP THESE
[ct=5987.415] PERSONNEL GROUPINGS WITH ZAC
[ct=5987.415] TAYLOR.
[ct=5991.419] THOSE TWO TIGHT ENDS, THREE
[ct=5992.741] TITANS, ROTATING IN AND OUT.
[ct=5993.960] HAVE TO TRY TO CREATE A MATCHUP.
[ct=5999.378] TOUGH MATCHUP FOR JA'MARR CHASE.
[ct=6003.399] OFFENSIVE LINE IS GOING TO GIVE
[ct=6004.744] HIM TIME TO THROW IN TIME TO
[ct=6005.955] STEP UP THE WAY HE HAS MOST OF
[ct=6011.342] AL: THE CROWD ROARING, STANDING.
[ct=6012.649] CHASE WIDE RIGHT.
[ct=6016.606] AND THIRD AND SIX.
[ct=6019.304] BURROW OVER THE MIDDLE, CAUGHT.
[ct=6020.712] BROWN, DIVES.
[ct=6021.852] FIRST DOWN TO THE 41 YARD LINE.
[ct=6025.829] 13 CARRIES, HE HAS NOW
[ct=6027.222] FOR 46 YARDS ON TOP OF THAT.
[ct=6029.885] KIRK: HE DOES A GOOD JOB.
[ct=6031.224] I THOUGHT IT WOULD
[ct=6033.880] LOOK AT HIS EYES.
[ct=6033.880] HE HAS ALREADY LOOKE
[ct=6036.561] INSTEAD HE TOOK THAT AWAY.
[ct=6037.903] WHAT A GOOD JOB HOLDI
[ct=6040.566] MAKING BETTER OF IT, THEN JUST
[ct=6043.169] CHECKING IT -- CHECKING IT DOWN.
[ct=6044.538] THOSE LINEBACKERS,
[ct=6045.753] PUMP FAKE AND CREATED THAT
[ct=6045.753] OPENING.
[ct=6053.789] AL: EXTRA PRESSURE GETS IT AWAY.
[ct=6055.197] CAUGHT ALONG THE SIDELINES.
[ct=6057.770] MAKING THAT GRAB.
[ct=6059.124] PICKS UP
[ct=6060.350] THREE.
[ct=6061.751] WASHINGTON ON THE TACKLE.
[ct=6065.805] KIRK: TONIGHT, THIS PACKAGE THAT
[ct=6067.060] THEY BUILT WITH GESICKI AND
[ct=6071.063] JA'MARR CHASE ON THAT SAME SIDE,
[ct=6071.063] ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY GET
[ct=6073.730] MAN-TO-MAN WHEN THEY GET SO
[ct=6075.163] CONSUMED AND WORRIED ABOUT CHASE
[ct=6076.437] MAKING PLAYS.
[ct=6077.657] THEY ARE OFTEN C
[ct=6079.079] GESICKI.
[ct=6080.344] EASY THROW THEIR FOR BURROW.
[ct=6080.344] JUST FOR POSITIVE YARDS.
[ct=6085.686] AL: SECOND AND FIVE.
[ct=6089.691] -- 5.
[ct=6091.112] ALL NIGHT LONG TO BROWN.
[ct=6094.938] KIRK: THAT'S THEIR RUNNING GAME.
[ct=6096.259] DOESN'T SHOW UP IN THE STAT
[ct=6096.259] SHEET.
[ct=6098.924] THAT HAS BEEN THEIR RUNNING GAME
[ct=6098.924] ALL YEAR.
[ct=6100.281] ESPECIALLY BEEN THE CASE
[ct=6102.971] LET THE LINEBACKERS CLEAR OUT,
[ct=6104.286] THEN CHECK IT DOWN.
[ct=6105.587] YOU KEEP CHECKING IT DOWN, YOU
[ct=6106.965] KEEP DOING THAT, THOSE EYES
[ct=6109.613] START TO CREEP UP, THE PACKERS
[ct=6110.982] START TO CREEP UP AND THAT'S
[ct=6112.226] WHAT JA'MARR CHASE CONTINUES TO
[ct=6112.226] DO BEHIND THEM.
[ct=6114.957] TALKED ABOUT IT EARLIER.
[ct=6116.387] REALLY GOOD PLAN TONIGHT WITH
[ct=6117.678] ALL THAT SPACE WITH THE
[ct=6121.660] AL: THIRD AND 2.
[ct=6125.667] BROWN BACK INTO THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=6128.291] PLAY CLOCK UNDER FIVE.
[ct=6136.214] GOING FOR IT ALL.
[ct=6137.581] CHASE, DOUBLE COVERED,
[ct=6141.570] MARCUS WILLIAMS BACK THERE.
[ct=6144.210] FOURTH DOWN AND 2.
[ct=6148.187] KIRK: WHEN YOU THROW A BALL LIKE
[ct=6149.539] THAT, YOU KNOW THEY ARE GOING
[ct=6150.852] FOR IT ON FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=6152.187] IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT TAKING
[ct=6152.187] A SHOT TO JA'MARR CHASE.
[ct=6154.808] I LOVE THE SWEEP THAT MARLON
[ct=6156.134] HUMPHREY SAID TO THE MEDIA.
[ct=6160.145] I THINK JOE BURROW LOVES
[ct=6161.482] THROWING THE BALL FORWARD TO H
[ct=6162.807] GUYS.
[ct=6164.128] BECAUSE A LOT OF TIME HE
[ct=6165.553] BELIEVES IN HIS GUYS IN THE HOUR
[ct=6166.847] THAT HE CAN THROW.
[ct=6166.847] THAT TIME HE JUST THREW IT OUT
[ct=6169.725] THERE KNOWING IF YOU MISSED IT
[ct=6170.899] HE WOULD GIVE IT A SHOT HERE ON
[ct=6172.253] THE 52.
[ct=6174.859] AL: IT WOULD BE ABOUT A 53
[ct=6176.165] FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT.
[ct=6180.126] FOURTH AND 2 WITH THE PLAY CLOCK
[ct=6181.563] AT ONE.
[ct=6181.563] AGAIN GOING DEEP.
[ct=6182.874] THAT'S INCOMPLETE.
[ct=6188.215] TRYING TO GO TO BURDEN THAT
[ct=6192.299] AND THE RAVENS NOW TAKE OVER.
[ct=6194.905] AT THEIR OWN 34 YARD LINE.
[ct=6198.890] 9:24 LEFT IN BALTIMORE ON
[ct=6198.890] THURSDAY NIGHT.
[ct=6200.187] THE RELIABILITY
[ct=6201.554] REPORT PRESENTED BY XFINITY
[ct=6201.554] INTERNET.
[ct=6205.610] THREE PLAYS BY THIS RAVENS
[ct=6209.537] LAMAR JACKSON IN POSITION.
[ct=6210.880] RAVENS ARE ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON
[ct=6210.880] IT.
[ct=6216.172] HE STAYS IN BOUNDS.
[ct=6217.570] TWO DEFENDERS COME OVER A LITTLE
[ct=6217.570] BIT LATE.
[ct=6226.890] THEY ARE ONE POINT AWAY FROM
[ct=6228.151] MAYBE IF THERE'S ANYTHING THEY
[ct=6229.475] CAN DO AND MAYBE THEY CAN TAKE
[ct=6229.475] THE LEAD.
[ct=6234.824] AL: TAKING OVER ON BOUNDS.
[ct=6236.080] BOTH THE 35 YARD LINES.
[ct=6241.620] WIDE OPEN.
[ct=6245.642] INSIDE THE TERRITORY.
[ct=6245.642] THEY GO AGAIN.
[ct=6249.642] OKLAHOMA STATE.
[ct=6250.885] COVERS THAT TIME LINE.
[ct=6252.264] THAT'S A GAIN OF 20.
[ct=6256.160] KIRK: THEY MOTION OUT AND I
[ct=6257.624] THINK HE JUST ENDS UP GETTING
[ct=6257.624] LOST IN COVERAGE.
[ct=6261.612] ONCE THEY MOTION HIM OUT THERE,
[ct=6262.864] THEY'VE GOT HIM OUTFLANKED.
[ct=6262.864] THEY'VE GOT ONE TOO MANY
[ct=6264.268] RECEIVERS.
[ct=6266.960] UPTIGHT ON THE UNDERNEATH ROUTE.
[ct=6268.205] NOBODY IS THERE TO BE ABLE TO
[ct=6268.205] TAKE WALLACE.
[ct=6272.170] WALLACE AT 16 COMING ALIVE.
[ct=6276.178] AL: 84 YARD GAIN, 20 YARD GAIN.
[ct=6281.643] FIRED UP A LITTLE.
[ct=6282.826] THAT'S ANDREWS.
[ct=6282.826] HE GETS INTO THE ACTION.
[ct=6286.815] ALREADY IN FIELD GOAL RANGE,
[ct=6289.479] KIRK: SINCE
[ct=6292.242] MARLON HUMPHREY GOT THE BALL OUT
[ct=6294.695] OF CHASE BROWN, RAVENS ARE
[ct=6296.097] PLAYING THEIR STYLE OF FOOTBALL.
[ct=6297.452] THERE PLAYING ON THEIR TERMS,
[ct=6298.797] DEFENSIVELY, MORE AGGRESSIVE,
[ct=6302.733] OFFENSIVELY, GETTING FIRST DOWN
[ct=6304.126] POSITIVE YARDS.
[ct=6308.167] NOT GOING BACK FOR DOING LEGAL
[ct=6308.167] PROCEDURE.
[ct=6309.421] THERE DOING THEIR T
[ct=6313.379] AL: HENRY.
[ct=6314.677] GAIN OF NINE.
[ct=6317.392] OLDS MOMENTUM NOW.
[ct=6322.815] THE RAVENS ARE TACKLED ERASING A
[ct=6325.474] 14 POINT DEFICIT AND NOW ON A
[ct=6325.474] QUEST FOR RE-TAKING THE LEAD.
[ct=6329.452] KIRK: IN TIMES WE SEE THIS WHEN
[ct=6330.630] DERRICK HENRY WAS IN HIS PRIME.
[ct=6332.053] BLACKS -- BACKSIDE BLOCKS.
[ct=6335.921] GOOD SIDE WITH DRESSING THAT
[ct=6338.614] HENRY HAS DIVISION, NICE
[ct=6339.947] CUT THEREBY HENRY.
[ct=6345.177] AL: SECOND AND 1, JACKSON, AND
[ct=6346.517] HE PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=6350.806] A LITTLE HAND SLAPPED FOR THE
[ct=6350.806] FAN.
[ct=6353.413] ANDREWS LED THE WAY.
[ct=6355.998] GAIN A FIVE FIRST DOWNS.
[ct=6359.973] KIRK: IT'S LIKE TODD IS HOLDING
[ct=6361.386] ONTO THAT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER
[ct=6364.170] JUST FOR THE RIGHT TIME TO BE
[ct=6364.170] ABLE TO TURN HIM LOOSE
[ct=6366.837] THAT TIME HE HAD AN ESCORT
[ct=6368.222] BLOCKER OUT IN FRONT OF HIM,
[ct=6370.817] MARK ANDREWS AND TODD MONCKTON
[ct=6370.817] FEELING IT.
[ct=6373.425] QUARTERBACKS PLAYING WELL.
[ct=6377.555] AL: DUMPS IT OFF.
[ct=6384.069] SAM COVERED AT 94.
[ct=6385.781] ON THAT TACKLE, THREE SECOND
[ct=6392.272] KIRK: AT THIS OFFENSE, DROPPING
[ct=6392.272] BOTH OF THEIR DEFENSE OF ENDS.
[ct=6396.301] DROPPING OUT IN THE FLAT.
[ct=6400.286] HAD A IN COVERAGE, ONLY RUSHING
[ct=6402.962] TRYING TO GET HIM TO JUST HOLD
[ct=6404.343] ONTO THE FOOT -- TO THE
[ct=6408.298] NOT ALWAYS IN PRESSURE AND IN
[ct=6408.298] THE BLITZ.
[ct=6414.879] AL: THIS TIME IT'S HILL.
[ct=6421.558] STOPPED AT THE 19 YARD LINE.
[ct=6422.821] HENDRICKSON AND ON THAT TACKLE
[ct=6424.191] ALONG WITH MIKE HILTON.
[ct=6425.495] A BIG THIRD AND NINE.
[ct=6428.229] KIRK: HENDRICKSON IS TALENTED.
[ct=6433.513] FOR THE HIS SIZE, NOT ONLY A
[ct=6433.513] PASS RUSHER, YOU COULD SEE ON
[ct=6436.121] THAT PLAY THE SPEED THAT HE HAS
[ct=6437.525] TO BE ABLE TO CHASE DOWN THE
[ct=6438.843] BALL CARRIER, HILL.
[ct=6442.806] AL: HENDRICKSON, STARTING HIS
[ct=6444.114] CAREER IN NEW ORLEANS.
[ct=6446.818] EIGHTH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=6450.956] LEADING THE LEAGUE IN SACKS.
[ct=6452.214] THIRD AND 9.
[ct=6460.143] TOUCHDOWN!
[ct=6462.814] MARK ANDREWS.
[ct=6476.183] BLITZ AND GOT BURNED.
[ct=6480.148] 18 YARDS, 0-2.
[ct=6484.193] KIRK: IT LOOKED LIKE A MIXUP IN
[ct=6485.497] LOGAN WILSON HAS TO BE ABLE TO
[ct=6486.852] CONTROL THIS CROSSING ROUTE.
[ct=6490.973] HE WAS WORKING ACROSS, THAT
[ct=6492.120] KIM TAYLOR.
[ct=6492.120] THEY ALMOST RAN INTO EACH OTHER.
[ct=6494.753] BUT CLEARLY LOOKED CONFUSED.
[ct=6497.376] NOBODY TAKES THE BIG GUY.
[ct=6500.016] ANOTHER PERFECT THROW BY LAMAR
[ct=6505.314] AL: ANDREWS TO THE END ZONE,
[ct=6506.585] JACKSON IS NOW THROWN FOR 234.
[ct=6507.935] GOING FOR TWO TO TRY TO MAKE IT
[ct=6507.935] A SEVEN POINT LEAD.
[ct=6517.327] ATTENTION.
[ct=6521.221] AL: JACKSON.
[ct=6521.221] STRUTS IN.
[ct=6525.179] FLINGS IT AWAY.
[ct=6530.526] IT'S GOOD.
[ct=6533.171] THE ROAD -- THEY'VE ERASED A 14
[ct=6535.864] POINT DEFICIT TO LEAD BY SEVEN.
[ct=6535.864] 28-21.
[ct=6545.092] RAY LEWIS IS RIGHT HERE AFTER
[ct=6545.092] THAT BEAUTIFUL SHOT.
[ct=6550.445] KIRK: RAY IS READY TO PLAY.
[ct=6551.896] HE'S FIRING UP THE CROWD.
[ct=6551.896] HE STILL FIRED UP.
[ct=6555.871] AL: GOING BACK TO THOSE YEARS.
[ct=6565.114] IT'S RETURNABLE, BUT THEY WILL
[ct=6565.114] BE DOWN INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=6569.198] KIRK: THINK ABOUT CINCINNATI
[ct=6570.610] GOING BACK TO WEEK FIVE.
[ct=6570.610] HERE'S THE QUARTERBACK TONIGHT.
[ct=6574.676] BOTH THESE GUYS AND THEY DID
[ct=6576.089] PLAY IN WEEK FIVE THEY PUT UP
[ct=6576.089] BIG NUMBERS.
[ct=6577.437] WHAT A TURNAROUND FOR LAMAR
[ct=6581.439] JACKSON 2026, THREE TOUCHDOWNS,
[ct=6581.439] 234.
[ct=6583.967] REMEMBER CINCINNATI HAD A LEAD
[ct=6585.375] IN THAT GAME.
[ct=6585.375] THERE WERE UP 10 IN
[ct=6586.696] QUARTER.
[ct=6589.518] TONIGHT THEY WERE UP PLAY 14 IN
[ct=6589.518] THE THIRD QUARTER.
[ct=6593.297] KIRK: THE RAVENS -- AL: THE
[ct=6597.237] RAVENS HAVE CLOCKED UP SO MANY
[ct=6600.011] FOURTH QUARTER LEAGUES -- LEADS
[ct=6601.283] IN THE YEAR.
[ct=6601.283] BRO GOING DEEP.
[ct=6606.569] CHASE, LOOK AT THIS!
[ct=6606.569] JUST LIKE THAT.
[ct=6610.534] CHASE IS GOING TO STRUT TO THE
[ct=6611.902] ONE YARD LINE, CROWD DOESN'T
[ct=6611.902] LIKE THAT.
[ct=6617.161] KIRK: THAT'S A RESPONSE TO WHAT
[ct=6618.515] LAMAR JACKSON DID.
[ct=6621.293] YOU TALK ABOUT AN ANSWER.
[ct=6624.021] YOU TALK ABOUT NUMBER NINE
[ct=6627.041] RESPONDING AND JA'MARR CHASE
[ct=6628.164] MAKING A HUGE PLAY.
[ct=6630.785] AL: 70 YARDS.
[ct=6632.059] CHASE TONIGHT, 238 RECEIVING
[ct=6634.688] YARDS AND BOROUGHS
[ct=6636.099] 400.
[ct=6636.099] HE'S 389 AT THE MOMENT.
[ct=6643.164] WELL -- WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?
[ct=6650.903] THAT TOOK 13 SECONDS OF WHICH HE
[ct=6653.496] WASTED L5 BEFORE HE GOT INTO THE
[ct=6658.787] MCPHERSON TO TIE THE GAME.
[ct=6672.086] SO AT 28-28, LAST TIME THEY HAVE
[ct=6673.496] 3140 EIGHT.
[ct=6674.722] HIGH-SCORING GAME OF THE SEASON
[ct=6676.142] WITH 5:37 LEFT IN THIS ONE.
[ct=6680.111] WILLIAMS.
[ct=6681.486] WE GIVE BENGALS ALL THE CREDIT.
[ct=6682.686] HE GETS CAUGHT UP, AND THEN HE
[ct=6682.686] JUST GETS LOST.
[ct=6687.053] I DON'T KNOW THE COVERAGE, S
[ct=6688.711] DON'T KNOW IF HE NEEDS TO BE
[ct=6690.625] BACK THERE IN CENTER FIELD, BUT
[ct=6690.982] OBVIOUSLY SOMEBODY NEEDS TO BE
[ct=6694.303] HELD AT 21 STEVENS OUT.
[ct=6695.230] THAT'S A MISMATCH.
[ct=6696.322] HE NEED SOMEBODY BACK THERE TO
[ct=6699.375] BE ABLE TO HELP HIM OVER TOP.
[ct=6700.727] LOOK AT STEVENS RUNNING.
[ct=6702.028] I THINK THEY GAVE UP ON THE PLAY
[ct=6703.397] LOOKING AROUND AT EACH OTHER
[ct=6704.785] LIKE, WHERE WAS MY HELP OVER
[ct=6704.785] TOP.
[ct=6708.742] THAT TIME MARCUS WILLIAMS WAS
[ct=6708.742] BENCHED JUST A COUPLE OF
[ct=6710.125] AGO.
[ct=6711.332] HE RESPONDED WELL LAST WEEK.
[ct=6714.024] BUT A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION,
[ct=6715.397] AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT
[ct=6716.762] IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND A
[ct=6716.762] TIGHT GAME AGAINST JOE BURROW.
[ct=6719.343] HE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT
[ct=6720.742] EVERY SINGLE TIME.
[ct=6722.039] WHAT A THROW IN THERE IS THAT
[ct=6724.718] CHEMISTRY AGAIN WITH BURRO AND
[ct=6730.040] AL: THE RAVENS WITH THE DEAD
[ct=6730.040] LAST FAST OFFENSE IN THE NFL.
[ct=6738.206] KIRK: THIS GUY, DOES HE GET
[ct=6739.442] ENOUGH HYPE FOR HOW GOOD HE IS?
[ct=6743.890] WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE ELITE,
[ct=6744.570] ELITE RECEIVERS.
[ct=6747.213] AL: HE'S AMONG THEM.
[ct=6749.473] KIRK: HE SURE IS.
[ct=6752.699] AL: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE
[ct=6754.116] RAVENS AND HOW MUCH TROUBLE
[ct=6755.876] THEY'VE HAD IN RECENT SEASONS
[ct=6756.759] AND THE FRUIT -- FOURTH QUARTER
[ct=6758.991] HOLDING ONTO LEADS.
[ct=6762.868] FIVE LOSSES AND LEADING IN THE
[ct=6763.985] FOURTH, TIED FOR THE SECOND MOST
[ct=6765.205] SINCE 2023.
[ct=6769.285] SO, AGAIN YOU ARE IN THE
[ct=6772.653] SITUATION, A BIG COMEBACK, AND
[ct=6775.572] THEN GIVING UP ON ONE PLAY THAT
[ct=6776.465] AMOUNTS TO THE TYING TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=6785.379] KIRK: WE'VE GOT TWO OF THE BEST
[ct=6785.379] CORNER BACKS IN THE LEAD GOING
[ct=6789.409] HEAD UP 28 WITH 5:30 LEFT TO GO.
[ct=6792.530] AL: JACKSON, LOOK OUT.
[ct=6793.675] AVOID THE SACK.
[ct=6794.342] HE THROWS DEEP.
[ct=6802.054] THAT IS PICKED OFF BY TAYLOR
[ct=6802.054] BRICKS.
[ct=6810.246] CAN TAYLOR BRITT -- OF COURSE
[ct=6813.146] THE BENGALS NOW PENDING ANOTHER
[ct=6815.751] TURNOVERS ARE REVIEWED, DOES HE
[ct=6817.038] HOLD ON, DOES HE KEEP IT?
[ct=6821.893] PREMATURE CELEBRATION.
[ct=6822.199] HE WAS IN THE END ZONE.
[ct=6826.787] KIRK: DEFINITELY COME BACK.
[ct=6830.577] JUST NOT ABLE TO GET HIS ARMS
[ct=6831.833] UNDERNEATH THE FOOTBALL BEFORE
[ct=6832.609] IT HITS THE SURFACE.
[ct=6836.054] A COUPLE OF GREAT LOOKS.
[ct=6839.877] IN LAMAR JACKSON LIVES TO TELL
[ct=6839.877] ABOUT IT.
[ct=6841.284] GOT AWAY WITH ONE THERE.
[ct=6845.317] AGAIN, HE COULD'VE TAKEN OFF,
[ct=6846.595] HAD POSITIVE YARDS IF YOU WANTED
[ct=6846.595] TO RUN IT.
[ct=6855.925] AL: SO SECOND AND 10.
[ct=6863.839] PLEASE PUT FIVE MINUTES AND 27
[ct=6870.514] SECONDS ON THE CLOCK RAVENS HAVE
[ct=6871.896] THREE TOUCHDOWNS ON THE LAST
[ct=6871.896] THREE DRIVES.
[ct=6889.222] ABOUT A FOUR YARD GAME.
[ct=6894.683] THIRD AND 6 AS THE CLOCK TICKS
[ct=6895.891] DOWN TO FIVE MINUTES AGO AND THE
[ct=6897.195] FOURTH.
[ct=6902.429] KIRK: HE RUNS THE FOOTBALL WITH
[ct=6903.899] DERRICK HENRY.
[ct=6911.989] HE'S DONE A LOT OF SHIFTING, A
[ct=6913.130] LOT OF CHANGING TO RESPOND TO AT
[ct=6913.130] THE RAVENS ARE GOING TO.
[ct=6923.662] AL: THIRD AND 6.
[ct=6923.662] FOUR-MAN RUSH.
[ct=6927.660] LAMAR THROWS, CAUGHT, FIRST
[ct=6930.347] TO THE 48 YARD LINE.
[ct=6935.642] BEEN A LOT OF KEY CATCHES
[ct=6936.979] TONIGHT FOR A TOTAL FIRST DOWN.
[ct=6940.921] KIRK: WILSON IS UP AND THEN
[ct=6940.921] DROPS.
[ct=6943.585] ONCE HE DROPS THERE'S A VOID IN
[ct=6944.966] RECEIVER COMES FROM THE LEFT AND
[ct=6947.657] SITS RIGHT THERE.
[ct=6948.880] LAMAR JACKSON WAITS UNTIL THE
[ct=6951.593] VERY LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT BEFORE
[ct=6954.246] HE DOES THAT, HE DOES THAT A LOT
[ct=6955.580] AND KIND OF JUMP PASS WHERE HE
[ct=6956.947] ELEVATES AND FLICKS THE BALL TO
[ct=6956.947] THE OPEN RECEIVER.
[ct=6962.184] BALTIMORE PROBABLY NOT IN A BIG
[ct=6962.184] HURRY RIGHT NOW.
[ct=6966.184] AL: FOUR MINUTES TO GO.
[ct=6970.154] JACKSON TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=6971.520] THAT'S TAKEN BY FLOWERS.
[ct=6976.822] FLOWERS IS FINALLY WRESTLED DOWN
[ct=6978.174] AT ABOUT THE 35 YARD LINE, FIRST
[ct=6983.474] KIRK: RIGHT THERE LAMAR JACKSON
[ct=6987.460] IS LOOKING DOWN FIELD,
[ct=6988.730] KNOWING HE COULD SENSE THE
[ct=6990.064] DEFENSE HAD DROPPED.
[ct=6991.426] NOBODY WAS OUT THERE.
[ct=6992.758] SO HE WAITED AND WAITED.
[ct=6996.733] DOWNFIELD, DOWNFIELD, KNOWING HE
[ct=6998.052] WOULD TAKE THE SEASON
[ct=6999.424] PERIPHERAL VISION.
[ct=7004.790] AL: A GAIN OF 19.
[ct=7022.191] TURNS ABOUT IT THREE YARD GAIN
[ct=7024.684] INTO AN EIGHT YARD TACKLED BY
[ct=7026.049] HILL, SECOND IN A DEUCE.
[ct=7030.002] KIRK: WORK THROUGH THAT ARM
[ct=7030.002] TACKLE OF DAVIS GAITHER THERE.
[ct=7032.677] WHEN HE RUNS THE FOOTBALL AT
[ct=7033.999] THIS STAGE IN THE GAME
[ct=7035.321] USUALLY GETS STRONGER AS THE
[ct=7037.979] GAME GOES ON HE GETS TOUGHER AND
[ct=7041.227] TOUGHER TO TACKLE AND SHOOK OFF
[ct=7042.470] A COUPLE WOULD BE TACKLERS.
[ct=7046.410] NUMBER ONE SAYING JUST GIVE US
[ct=7047.739] ANOTHER CHANCE.
[ct=7055.777] AL: SECOND AND2.
[ct=7058.494] HENRY AGAIN, JUST ENOUGH.
[ct=7059.752] THAT'S ALL HE NEEDED.
[ct=7059.752] TAKES MORE TIME OFF THE CLOCK.
[ct=7065.306] HE HAS FULL COMPLEMENTS PLUS
[ct=7066.479] TIMEOUT AND THE TWO-MINUTE
[ct=7069.229] UNDER THREE TO PLAY.
[ct=7073.150] KIRK: 41-30 AND OVER TIME.
[ct=7074.453] WEEK FIVE.
[ct=7075.780] HERE WE ARE 28-28 UNDER THREE TO
[ct=7082.473] AL: AFC NORTH, PITTSBURGH,
[ct=7086.392] BALTIMORE IS ALMOS
[ct=7087.730] ATMOSPHERE.
[ct=7090.414] KIRK: IN THE OLD DAYS IT WAS
[ct=7091.804] MORE ABOUT DEFENSE.
[ct=7097.099] THEY ARE MORE PHYSICAL TEAM.
[ct=7098.441] NOW THE QUARTERBACK PLAYING,
[ct=7099.814] ESPECIALLY THESE TWO TEAMS.
[ct=7103.691] AL: NOW WITH THE PLAY CLOCK AT
[ct=7103.691] TWO.
[ct=7107.664] RAVENS HAVE TO TAKE A TIMEOUT.
[ct=7114.363] THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS GAME, IF
[ct=7115.754] THE RAVENS WIN, THEY ARE THREE
[ct=7117.085] GAMES UP ON THESE GUYS.
[ct=7119.693] EVERYBODY IS FORGETTIN
[ct=7121.113] PITTSBURGH.
[ct=7122.432] PITTSBURGH STILL HAS TO PLAY ALL
[ct=7122.432] SIX DIVISION GAMES.
[ct=7126.394] BUT THE AFC NORTH, THEY WILL BE
[ct=7126.394] GREAT AND THEY ARE AGAIN.
[ct=7130.440] KIRK: YOU KNEW COMING IN,
[ct=7131.744] BALTIMORE LOSES THE CHAMPIONSHIP
[ct=7133.081] GAME A YEAR AGO AT HOME AGAINST
[ct=7133.081] KANSAS CITY.
[ct=7137.125] BEING AROUND THIS WEEK, I THINK
[ct=7138.402] BEING THAT CLOSE AND LOSING,
[ct=7139.846] ESPECIALLY LAMAR.
[ct=7141.235] LAMAR TALKING ABOUT WITH KAYLEE
[ct=7143.803] BEFORE WE STARTED, HE'S
[ct=7143.803] POSSESSED, HE'S FOCUSED.
[ct=7146.544] I THINK IT'S BECAUSE HE’S
[ct=7147.764] ACCOMPLISHED EVERYTHING.
[ct=7149.024] HE HAS ONE AND VPS, HE MAY WIN
[ct=7150.427] ANOTHER THIS YEAR BUT HE HASN'T
[ct=7153.080] BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT RING IN
[ct=7153.791] THIS TEAM IS DRIVEN TO GET THAT
[ct=7153.791] OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=7157.936] AL: PITTSBURGH ON THE CHARGERS.
[ct=7158.423] FLOWERS MAKES THE GRAB.
[ct=7161.470] THERE'S A FLAG ON THE PLAY.
[ct=7186.431] KIRK: SO HE TAKES A PEEK, RUN
[ct=7187.107] PASS OPTION WHERE HE CAN RUN IT
[ct=7187.776] OFF TO HENRY.
[ct=7191.083] THIS IS WHERE HE WILL GET
[ct=7191.735] HE DECIDES TO THROW IT.
[ct=7193.552] HE CAN HAND THIS BALL TO HENRY.
[ct=7193.918] HE SEES WHAT HE WANTS BECAUSE HE
[ct=7194.461] HAD LEVERAGE.
[ct=7198.327] ONCE THIS DEFENDER GOT INSIDE HE
[ct=7198.327] KNEW HE COULD THROW IT TO THE
[ct=7201.870] THE PROBLEM IS, IT TOOK TOO LONG
[ct=7204.646] IT'S ALWAYS FRUSTRATING TO A
[ct=7206.366] COACH WHEN YOU HAVE A RUN/PASS
[ct=7207.950] OPTION AND YOU FIND THEM IN
[ct=7208.558] DOWNFIELD ON THE RIGHT CALL IS
[ct=7208.558] MADE.
[ct=7214.249] AL: SO FIRST AND 15.
[ct=7214.544] BALL BACK AT THE 29.
[ct=7221.719] KIRK: A LITTLE DUMP OFFS -- AL:
[ct=7224.264] A LITTLE DUMP OFF.
[ct=7225.512] ANDREWS.
[ct=7229.877] DAVIS GAITHER MAKES THE STOP.
[ct=7234.031] THINKING ABOUT TAKING TIME OUT
[ct=7234.584] SO THEY DO RIGHT HERE.
[ct=7240.428] IN THE OLD DAYS, LIKE 20 MINUTES
[ct=7245.121] AGO, YOU WOULD SAY, AUTOMATIC
[ct=7245.928] FOR JUSTIN TUCKER, ONE OF THE
[ct=7246.551] GREATS OF ALL TIME.
[ct=7248.049] I DON'T THINK ANYTHING IS
[ct=7250.069] AUTOMATIC THESE DAYS WITH A LOT
[ct=7250.069] OF KICKERS.
[ct=7253.839] THAT'S THE EXTRA POINT BEFORE.
[ct=7259.957] KIRK: I THINK YOU GOT CONFIDENCE
[ct=7259.957] IN LAMAR JACKSON, HIS
[ct=7260.338] DECISION-MAKING AND PLAYMAKING
[ct=7262.971] ABILITY AND THE PLAYERS AROUND
[ct=7265.876] I THINK KNOWING JOHN HARBAUGH,
[ct=7267.604] HE WILL BE AGGRESSIVE.
[ct=7269.502] THEY WILL TRY TO GET A TOUCHDOWN
[ct=7271.372] AND AT THE SAME TIME WORK THAT
[ct=7272.424] CLOCK DOWN BECAUSE OF BURRO AND
[ct=7277.446] SECOND AND 10.
[ct=7283.060] BOUGHT, SPINNING AROUND.
[ct=7284.260] TAKES IT TO THE EIGHT YARD LINE.
[ct=7290.868] THAT BALL WAS HFWAY IN THE AIR
[ct=7291.692] BEFORE BATEMAN GOT TO THE TOP OF
[ct=7291.692] HIS ROW.
[ct=7296.283] THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS
[ct=7298.416] HERE IS YOUR RECEIVER,
[ct=7300.040] WHEN HE THROWS THIS FOOTBALL.
[ct=7302.677] SOFT COVERAGE.
[ct=7303.895] GOING TO STOP IT RIGHT AS HE
[ct=7305.642] RELEASES THE BALL AND LOOK WHERE
[ct=7305.642] BATEMAN IS.
[ct=7308.973] BALL HAS ALREADY BEEN WELL OUT,
[ct=7309.516] IT'S HALFWAY THROUGH AND HE
[ct=7309.628] STARTING TO TURN HIS HEAD.
[ct=7314.721] THAT'S TOUGH TO COVER ONE A
[ct=7315.206] RECEIVER AND QUARTERBACK ARE
[ct=7316.576] THROWING IT IN SYNC AND HE
[ct=7317.101] LOCATES IT TO THAT OUTSIDE
[ct=7319.291] SHOULDER AWAY FROM THE CORNER.
[ct=7323.899] AL: BATEMAN IS ONE OF THOSE
[ct=7324.648] UNSUNG GUYS.
[ct=7326.382] FLOWERS HAS BEEN GETTING A LOT
[ct=7326.382] OF FLOWERS.
[ct=7330.061] WALLACE HAS BEEN THE GUIDED
[ct=7331.320] NIGHT BUT BATEMAN HAS MADE SOME
[ct=7331.883] VERY KEY CATCHES TONIGHT.
[ct=7339.588] THEY WILL BE CONTENT TO TAKE IT
[ct=7341.607] TO THE FIVE YARD LINE.
[ct=7341.607] TAKES US TO THE TWO-MINUTE
[ct=7346.317] BANGLES HAVE ONE TIMEOUT LEFT.
[ct=7348.217] IT WILL BE SECOND IN GOAL WHEN
[ct=7350.651] TWO MINUTES LEFT IN REGULATION
[ct=7352.233] AND A TIE GAME.
[ct=7354.969] TWO MINUTES TO GO, WE A
[ct=7356.324] TIED.
[ct=7356.324] IT IS SECOND DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=7361.596] KIRK: I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
[ct=7362.998] CINCINNATI LETS THEM SCORE JUST
[ct=7365.492] TO GIVE BURROW TIME COMPARED TO
[ct=7365.492] LETTING
[ct=7371.371] AL: THIS IS HIM IN THE END ZONE.
[ct=7375.226] THAT THE BIG BREAK FOR THE
[ct=7376.633] BENGALS BECAUSE THAT STOPS THE
[ct=7376.633] CLOCK.
[ct=7382.195] NOW IT'S THIRD DOWN AND GOAL IN
[ct=7383.592] THE BANGLES HOLD ON TO THAT ONE
[ct=7387.544] KIRK: IF YOU THINK ABOUT
[ct=7388.892] BALTIMORE RUNNING THE FOOTBALL
[ct=7390.188] ONES, RUNNING AT A SECOND TIME.
[ct=7392.904] TIMEOUTS.
[ct=7394.204] YOU WORK IT ALL THE WAY DOWN
[ct=7395.713] 30, 35 SECONDS.
[ct=7398.471] CHIP SHOT TO TAKE THE LEAD WITH
[ct=7399.769] 30-35 SECONDS.
[ct=7402.376] COMPARED TO GIVING BURROW A
[ct=7403.746] LITTLE BIT OF TIME, YOU HAVE TO
[ct=7403.746] GO SCORE A TOUCHDOWN, BUT AT
[ct=7406.317] LEAST YOU HAVE SOME TIME TO
[ct=7406.317] WORK.
[ct=7409.125] NOW THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
[ct=7410.395] ABOUT THAT AFTER THE INCOMPLETE.
[ct=7410.395] AL: NOT
[ct=7411.782] THIRD AND GOAL.
[ct=7414.592] RUNNING AROUND.
[ct=7417.188] JUMP PASS, TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=7418.582] BATEMAN.
[ct=7423.745] RASHOD BATEMAN, AND THEY HAVE
[ct=7425.152] THE LEAD AGAIN.
[ct=7431.731] KIRK: THAT WAS QUITE THE JUMP
[ct=7431.731] SHOT.
[ct=7435.819] HE HAS SHOWN INABILITY TONIGHT
[ct=7437.154] TO WORK FROM THE POCKET, HE HAS
[ct=7438.376] SHOWN THE ABILITY TO GET
[ct=7441.078] HE HAS SHOWN A LOT OF VELOCITY
[ct=7442.310] WHEN HE HAD TO PUT SOMETHING ON
[ct=7445.069] IT, HE HAS ALSO SHOWN A LOT OF
[ct=7446.383] THESE TOUCH PASSES THAT HE HAS
[ct=7449.254] THROWN TO THESE RECEIVERS
[ct=7452.088] THAT TIME WHEN YOU SEE THIS
[ct=7452.088] FOLLOW-THROUGH IS LIKE A STEPH
[ct=7453.320] CURRY JUMP SHOT A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=7458.682] AL: THAT'S FOR TOUCHDOWN PASSES
[ct=7458.682] FOR JACKSON TONIGHT.
[ct=7461.263] THE RAVENS HAVE SCORE TOUCHDOWNS
[ct=7465.310] ON FOUR STRAIGHT DRIVES AND THE
[ct=7465.310] EXTRA POINT IS GOOD.
[ct=7472.120] KIRK: IT WORKS OUT, THEY HAVE
[ct=7472.120] TIME TO WORK
[ct=7474.711] HERE'S THIS THROW.
[ct=7477.403] NOW WATCH THIS STEPH CURRY
[ct=7478.722] LITTLE JUMP, AND LOOK AT THE
[ct=7478.722] FOLLOW-THROUGH.
[ct=7481.333] PERFECT LOCATION.
[ct=7484.000] YOUR GUY, BATEMAN WITH THE
[ct=7484.000] GO-AHEAD TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=7487.984] AL: SIX FOR BATEMAN TONIGHT.
[ct=7491.989] FOR TOUCHDOWN PASSES FOR LAMAR.
[ct=7491.989] HE'S GOING FOR 290 NOW.
[ct=7498.705] THERE'S BATEMAN WORKING ON
[ct=7501.284] DELIBERATE.
[ct=7502.712] KIRK: PUT THAT FOOT IN THE
[ct=7504.077] GROUND GOING THE OTHER WAY.
[ct=7504.077] HE'S GOT IT.
[ct=7506.740] AS SOON AS HE THREW IT HE STARTS
[ct=7506.740] TO HEAD TO THE BENCH.
[ct=7511.920] 70 FRONT -- 71 YARDS IN THE
[ct=7514.668] FIRST HALF AT 219 AND THREE
[ct=7516.009] TOUCHDOWNS IN THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=7519.991] AL: I THINK THEY MADE A FEW
[ct=7519.991] ADJUSTMENTS.
[ct=7525.260] KIRK: I THINK THEY DID.
[ct=7526.619] IT WILL BE FUN TO SEE WHAT JOE
[ct=7526.619] BURROW CHASE CAN DO.
[ct=7530.610] AL: YOU NEVER KNOW.
[ct=7531.982] IT AIN'T OVER, BABY.
[ct=7534.579] SEVEN POINT LEAD.
[ct=7545.255] DOWN IN THE END ZONE.
[ct=7549.184] START AT THE 30.
[ct=7551.802] REMINDER AFTER THE GAME IS THE
[ct=7551.802] POST GAME SHOW ON PRIME VIDEO.
[ct=7557.258] THEY WILL BE INTERVIEWING THE
[ct=7557.258] START OF THE GAME, OUR GANG IS
[ct=7559.769] HERE TO RECAP AT ALL.
[ct=7563.765] QUITE THE RECAP -- A
[ct=7565.157] RECAP TONIGHT.
[ct=7565.157] A LOT.
[ct=7570.408] KIRK: THIS COMES DOWN TO THE
[ct=7571.768] OFFENSIVE LINE GIVING JOE BURROW
[ct=7571.768] TIME TO THROW.
[ct=7575.861] JOE BURROW LIVES FOR THESE
[ct=7577.208] OF OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE
[ct=7577.208] PRESSURE ON.
[ct=7581.137] NO TIMEOUTS, DOWN SEVEN.
[ct=7589.133] AL: CHASE DOWN, THROWS, CAN'T BE
[ct=7591.847] ONE-HANDED BECAUSE ALWAYS PUTS
[ct=7593.131] THE PRESSURE ON, SECOND AND 10
[ct=7594.415] WITH 1:44.
[ct=7598.502] KIRK: INTERESTING DECISION WITH
[ct=7599.782] THE FIRST TIME DEFENSE
[ct=7601.105] COORDINATOR LEARNING AS HE GOES,
[ct=7603.676] DOING A GOOD JOB, HE WAS
[ct=7605.055] UPSTAIRS, CAME OVER A FEW WEEKS
[ct=7609.064] PRESSURE THERE.
[ct=7610.338] SITTING BACK IN PREVENT DEFENSE.
[ct=7613.048] GET AFTER BURROW.
[ct=7626.279] AL: CHASE TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=7630.259] BURROW, PRESSURE, HE THROWS.
[ct=7635.627] HE'S HAD THREE SACKS TONIGHT.
[ct=7639.536] KIRK: IT LOOKED LIKE THEY MAY
[ct=7642.316] HAVE GOTTEN A HOLD OF JOE
[ct=7642.316] BURROW'S FACEMASK THERE ON THE
[ct=7643.641] LET'S SEE IF IT DID.
[ct=7647.557] YEAH, HE GOT HIS THUMB.
[ct=7647.557] HE ACTUALLY GRABBED ONTO IT.
[ct=7654.247] NO CALLS, SO IT'S THIRD AND 10.
[ct=7658.262] AL: HE SURE DID.
[ct=7658.262] NO CALL.
[ct=7665.211] PROTECTION.
[ct=7665.211] THEY’
[ct=7669.174] AL: BURROW FIRES OVER THE
[ct=7670.570] MIDDLE, NOBODY HOME THERE.
[ct=7671.812] SO, FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=7674.557] DOWN TO ONE MORE PLAY.
[ct=7678.545] KIRK: BRINGS THE PRESSURE.
[ct=7682.545] BURROW HAD TO GET THE BALL OUT,
[ct=7685.170] MISCOMMUNICATION.
[ct=7686.503] THEY ARE NOT MAKING THAT MOVE
[ct=7689.149] OVER THE MIDDLE WHERE THEY'VE
[ct=7689.149] HAD SO MUCH SUCCESS TONIGHT.
[ct=7691.781] FIRST PLAY THE GAME.
[ct=7699.670] AL: LAST GAS.
[ct=7713.055] FOURTH DOWN, BURROW FIRES, AND
[ct=7714.349] THAT IS GOING TO BE CAUGHT AT
[ct=7714.349] THE 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=7719.681] AND THEY ARE GOING TO GIVE HIM
[ct=7721.045] THE FIRST.
[ct=7722.380] WITH THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=7727.675] AND THEY STOP THE CLOCK YOU
[ct=7730.377] CAN'T CHALLENGE ANYTHING AT THIS
[ct=7734.360] BUT YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT
[ct=7735.691] THEY ARE DOING.
[ct=7735.691] SO THEY WILL LOOK AT THIS
[ct=7738.311] UPSTAIRS.
[ct=7741.002] WHOA, WHERE'S THE BALL?
[ct=7743.637] KIRK: WHERE IS THE BALL AND THAT
[ct=7745.036] NEED TOUCHES.
[ct=7746.352] AL: IT CAN'T BE
[ct=7748.974] WHAT ARE YOU SEEING?
[ct=7751.654] >> YOU LOOK FOR A DOWN THE LINE
[ct=7754.358] TOUCHES.
[ct=7757.085] IF IT TOUCHES THE 40, IT'S A
[ct=7758.433] WE HAVEN’
[ct=7759.673] WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING YET SO
[ct=7761.126] FAR UNTIL IT'S CLEAR AND OBVIOUS
[ct=7762.366] THAT WE REVERSE THIS.
[ct=7765.075] AS OF NOW IT'S GOING TO STAND.
[ct=7766.386] KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE HE’
[ct=7767.692] KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S ON THE
[ct=7769.005] LINE WITH THE BALL COMES DOWN.
[ct=7770.388] WHAT IN EFFORT WITH THE GAME ON
[ct=7775.683] AL: THAT'S THE END OF THE PLAY,
[ct=7778.329] BUT THE POINT OF THE BALL IS ON
[ct=7779.753] THE 40 YARD LINE, IT'S A FIRST
[ct=7783.754] IF IT'S A FIRST DOWN YOU HAVE
[ct=7785.123] 121 AND YOU STILL HAVE THAT
[ct=7789.071] IN THE BALL WILL BE AT THE 40
[ct=7796.995] MEANWHILE, LET'S NOTICE YOU LOOK
[ct=7796.995] AT JACKSON, FOR TOUCHDOWN PASSES
[ct=7805.002] RIGHT NOW, LAMAR JACKSON HAS
[ct=7806.191] THROWN 24 TOUCHDOWN PASSES IN
[ct=7806.191] TWO INTERCEPTIONS.
[ct=7809.001] 24-2.
[ct=7811.582] KIRK: NOT TO MENTION WHAT HE
[ct=7814.231] DOES WITH HIS LEGS OVER 500
[ct=7814.231] YARDS RUSHING.
[ct=7816.986] AGAIN, BURROW ONCE AGAIN GETS
[ct=7819.740] HIT AS HE MAKES THAT THROW.
[ct=7830.243] AL: IN THE BANGLES HAVE ALREADY
[ct=7831.616] STARTED TO HUDDLE WHICH LEADS US
[ct=7833.356] TO BELIEVE THEY'VE ALREADY TOLD
[ct=7833.356] CINCINNATI IT'S GOING TO STAND.
[ct=7835.724] EVEN THOUGH BLAKEMAN IS LOOKING
[ct=7835.724] AT IT.
[ct=7841.015] HARBAUGH WANTS TO LEAVE IT OFF
[ct=7843.687] BUT TO NO AVAIL -- BUT TO NO
[ct=7845.061] AVAIL, WE THINK IT'S GOING TO
[ct=7845.061] STAND.
[ct=7847.665] OUR INSIDE INFORMATION.
[ct=7848.995] WHATEVER THAT IS.
[ct=7863.642] SO HERE WE GO.
[ct=7865.088] 81 SECONDS, ONE TIMEOUT.
[ct=7867.558] KIRK: THEY KEEP MOVING JA'MARR

[ct=7875.935] 399 YARDS.
[ct=7884.957] BURROW FIRES, INCOMPLETE.
[ct=7891.561] SMOTHERED.
[ct=7896.833] KIRK: THESE DEFENSIVE BACKS OF
[ct=7898.153] HAD TO MOVE AROUND A DERRIUS
[ct=7899.707] WASHINGTON.
[ct=7899.707] HE'S 5’8".
[ct=7903.480] YOU'D THINK HE WAS SIX FOOT 5,
[ct=7904.817] 66.
[ct=7904.817] -- 6'6".
[ct=7910.054] HE'S ABLE TO EXTEND IT AND KNOCK
[ct=7910.054] THE BALL AWAY.
[ct=7926.242] AL: TO THE OUTSIDE, CHASE, A
[ct=7926.242] FLAG IS THROWN ON THE PLAY.
[ct=7930.056] KIRK: HE GRABBED A HOLD OF THE
[ct=7931.457] RECEIVER.
[ct=7944.681] AL: IF IT'S ON THE DEFENSE IT’S
[ct=7944.681] AN AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
[ct=7948.720] AND YOU WOULD TAKE THE PENALTY.
[ct=7952.662] YOU GOT A HANDFUL OF SECONDS.
[ct=7957.000] KIRK: DID HE GET A HOLD OF THE
[ct=7959.949] SHOULDER PATTER THE FACE MASKS?
[ct=7962.606] HE DID.
[ct=7965.282] THAT'LL BE TACKED ON TO THE
[ct=7966.517] BACKEND
[ct=7967.882] THAT'S 15 MORE YARDS.
[ct=7971.876] AL: THEY MISSED ONE FACEMASK BUT
[ct=7971.876] GOT THE OTHER.
[ct=7978.511] KIRK: IT'S THE VETERAN,
[ct=7978.511] HUMPHREY, GETS THAT RIGHT HAND
[ct=7982.389] JUST TRYING TO GET OFF THE LINE
[ct=7982.389] OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=7989.082] AL: THE BALL NOW AT THE

[ct=7990.361] 66 SECONDS.
[ct=7999.716] THROWS, HE'S GOT CHASE AGAIN.
[ct=8003.677] ADD CHASE TO THE 23 BUT A FLAG
[ct=8006.275] IS THROWN ON THIS PLAY WITH TWO
[ct=8006.275] FLAGS
[ct=8011.594] KIRK: BURROW GOT DESTROYED AFTER
[ct=8011.594] HE THROUGH THIS CALL.
[ct=8018.254] AL: ON BRODERICK WASHINGTON.
[ct=8022.233] KIRK: BY THE WAY, HE HAS BEEN
[ct=8024.937] HIT ALL NIGHT.
[ct=8026.268] GETS HIT OVER TODD, THEY FOLLOW
[ct=8027.545] THROUGH AND DRIVE HIM INTO THE
[ct=8030.310] GROUND, WASHINGTON DOES.
[ct=8031.581] LOOK WHERE THEIR LOCATION OF THE
[ct=8031.581] BALL IS.
[ct=8032.980] ONCE AGAIN UNDER DURESS.
[ct=8036.926] HE GETS A TO HIS GUY, HALF THE
[ct=8038.188] DISTANCE TO THE GOAL LINE AND IN
[ct=8038.188] THE BLINK OF AN EYE THEY ARE
[ct=8039.539] INSIDE OF THE RED ZONE.
[ct=8043.523] AL: 15 YARD PENALTY.
[ct=8045.022] A LOT GOING ON.
[ct=8048.925] IF HE SCORES, HE IS 0-2.
[ct=8052.841] THE RAVENS HAVE PLENTY OF TIME.
[ct=8052.841] THEY'VE GOT TO TIMEOUTS.
[ct=8055.531] 59 SECONDS.
[ct=8060.760] FROM THE 12.

[ct=8072.715] END ZONE, IN INCOMPLETE THERE
[ct=8074.138] COVERED BY NATE WIGGINS, SECOND
[ct=8080.675] KIRK: JUST AMAZED HOW JOE BURROW
[ct=8082.013] SITS IN THAT POCKET, HE DOESN'T
[ct=8083.317] HAS HAPPY FEET.
[ct=8084.619] HE GETS HIT ALMOST EVERY TIME HE
[ct=8087.348] EVERY WEEK OF THE SEASON.
[ct=8089.963] NOT TONIGHT, EVERY WEEK.
[ct=8092.654] THIS IS YEAR FIVE AND THE GUY
[ct=8093.958] DOESN'T FLINCH.
[ct=8095.390] IT'S REMARKABLE.
[ct=8102.040] AL: THOSE PIERCING EYES
[ct=8104.643] SURVEYING THAT DEFENSE SECOND

[ct=8112.600] HANGS IN THE POCKET AGAIN,
[ct=8118.072] FIRES, CAUGHT THE FIVE
[ct=8124.838] CHASE TONIGHT, LIVING CATCHES --
[ct=8124.838] 11 CATCHES.
[ct=8127.445] YOU HAVE A FLAG ON THE PLAY.
[ct=8132.897] AL: AWAY FROM THE PLATE ITSELF.
[ct=8136.923] PROBABLY ON VAN MALLOY.
[ct=8139.541] 53 MAY HAVE JUMPED.
[ct=8144.965] >> OFFSIDE, DEFENSE, NUMBER 53,
[ct=8144.965] LINED UP IN THE NEUTRAL ZONE.
[ct=8147.541] , REPLAY SECOND DOWN.
[ct=8155.525] AL: THEY WILL TAKE THAT BECAUSE
[ct=8155.525] IT MAKES IT SECOND DOWN AND 5.
[ct=8159.527] KIRK: TRY TO GET A JUMP AND HE
[ct=8160.765] GETS CAUGHT, TRYING TO POKE
[ct=8160.765] HIMSELF BACK.
[ct=8164.744] AL: SO 50 SECONDS.
[ct=8171.377] AT THE 7.
[ct=8180.663] BURROW FLUSHED OUT, TO BROWN,
[ct=8182.159] AND BROWN IS OUT OF BOUNDS AT
[ct=8184.629] THE FIVE YARD LINE, SO CHASE
[ct=8185.910] BROWN IS THERE.
[ct=8188.526] IT'S GOING TO BE THIRD AND 3.
[ct=8191.193] AND AGAIN,
[ct=8192.639] HAVE THAT TIMEOUT.
[ct=8193.931] AL: --
[ct=8197.995] THEY WILL HOLD ONTO THAT TIMEOUT
[ct=8202.026] AND WITH 42 SECONDS AND LAMAR
[ct=8202.026] JACKSON AND HIS GROUP OF
[ct=8204.699] RECEIVERS AND A KICKER, YOU
[ct=8206.020] KNOW, THEY DON'T NEED A TON OF
[ct=8210.004] RIGHT NOW, JOE BURROW IS
[ct=8211.332] PROBABLY NOT WORRIED ABOUT TIME.
[ct=8213.946] HE'S WORRIED ABOUT GETTING THE
[ct=8215.328] BALL INTO THE END ZONE AND ITS
[ct=8215.328] DECISION TIME.
[ct=8219.280] AL: CHASE LINED UP TO THE RIGHT
[ct=8219.280] SIDE.
[ct=8224.623] PUNTS THAT WAY, THROWS THAT WAY,
[ct=8227.428] CHASE, WHAT A NIGHT.
[ct=8233.906] THIS IS AS GOOD AS THEIR FIRST
[ct=8235.278] MEETING THIS YEAR.
[ct=8236.529] IT TURNED OUT TO BE.
[ct=8240.538] SO NOW, NOW, IF YOU ARE
[ct=8241.968] CINCINNATI, YOU WANT TO GO FOR
[ct=8243.177] 2, 1?
[ct=8244.534] WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO HERE?
[ct=8248.546] KIRK: ZAC TAYLOR HAS BEEN
[ct=8250.105] AGGRESSIVE ALL NIGHT.
[ct=8251.351] AL: THEY WILL GO FOR IT.
[ct=8255.291] THEY ARE GOING FOR THE LEAD.
[ct=8256.584] I DON'T WANT TO SAY THE WIN YET.
[ct=8259.184] THE RAVENS HAVE TO GET THE BALL
[ct=8260.469] BACK BUT THEY HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS.
[ct=8263.095] KIRK: THERE'S A MATCHUP ALREADY.
[ct=8265.802] YOU CAN SEE THAT HE WANTS RIGHT
[ct=8269.740] IT IS STEPHENS AGAINST CHASE.
[ct=8272.393] HE'S GOT HIM ISOLATED.
[ct=8275.011] TAKES IT.
[ct=8277.726] THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.
[ct=8284.357] AL: THAT'S INTERESTING.
[ct=8287.007] KIRK: ZAC TAYLOR CAME ALL THE
[ct=8287.007] WAY DOWN.
[ct=8289.731] >> THIRD AND FINAL TIMEOUT.
[ct=8292.317] KIRK: LET'S TAKE A PEEK AT THIS
[ct=8294.960] TOUCHDOWN, AND ONCE AGAIN, IT'S
[ct=8298.919] A GREAT THROW IN A NICE JOB --
[ct=8301.766] AND A NICE JOB, BUT YOU HAVE A
[ct=8305.591] ROOKIE CORNER IN WIGGINS AND
[ct=8306.988] LINEBACKER AND TWO GUYS THAT
[ct=8306.988] TAKE THE FLAG.
[ct=8309.597] THE READ AS YOU
[ct=8310.979] UNDERNEATH RECEIVER AND A DEEP
[ct=8316.220] YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
[ct=8317.606] READING ONLY ONE RECEIVER.
[ct=8320.312] SPECTACULAR CATCH BY JA'MARR
[ct=8320.312] CHASE ONCE AGAIN.
[ct=8326.994] AL: HE WANTED TO SEE WHAT THE
[ct=8326.994] DEFENSE HAD.
[ct=8329.633] KIRK: NOW THE
[ct=8330.930] COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FORMATION.
[ct=8332.294] AL: TOTALLY.
[ct=8333.536] KIRK: THERE YOU GO.
[ct=8336.292] THERE GOES CHASE.
[ct=8337.650] HE'S GOT IT AGAIN.
[ct=8338.849] AL: THE SAME THING.
[ct=8341.433] KIRK: TO THE RIGHT, CHASE TO THE
[ct=8342.798] LEFT SIDE.
[ct=8345.392] TO THE RIGHT SIDE HE GOES.
[ct=8348.130] INCOMPLETE AT THE GOAL LINE.
[ct=8353.388] WASHINGTON BREAKING IT UP.
[ct=8369.318] AND THE RAVENS ARE GOING TO PULL
[ct=8374.704] OFF A BIG VICTORY, DOWN BY 14.
[ct=8379.981] AL: WATCH GESICKI, WHO HE DIDN'T
[ct=8381.373] LOOK TO, BUT WATCH OUT PHYSICAL
[ct=8382.624] THIS ROUT IS.
[ct=8385.279] THEY GRAB HOLD OF HIM.
[ct=8387.883] THAT IS DEFENSIVE HOLDING RIGHT
[ct=8387.883] THERE THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE
[ct=8389.254] CALLED.
[ct=8391.945] AND THERE'S
[ct=8393.261] WITH AN UNDERSIZED DEFENSIVE
[ct=8396.002] >> ONSIDE KICK.
[ct=8398.681] KIRK: THE FRUSTRATING
[ct=8399.884] GESICKI THROWING HIS ARMS UP IN
[ct=8402.730] THE AIR ASKING WHERE IS THE
[ct=8402.730] DEFENSIVE HOLDING CALL?
[ct=8410.539] KIRK: I DON'T THINK ZAC TAYLOR
[ct=8413.145] WANTED TO GIVE LAMAR JACKSON AN
[ct=8418.661] OPPORTUNITY INTO OVERTIME.
[ct=8421.170] HE SCORED FOUR STRAI
[ct=8422.492] TOUCHDOWNS AND DIDN'T WANT TO
[ct=8422.492] ROLL THE DICE.
[ct=8425.105] HE SAW THAT IN
[ct=8426.616] FIVE AND SAID LET'S TAKE A
[ct=8427.817] CHANCE AND TRY TO WIN IT WHILE
[ct=8427.817] WE CAN.
[ct=8431.798] AL: CINCINNATI HAS DECLARED,
[ct=8433.385] WHICH YOU HAVE TO DO THESE DAYS,
[ct=8434.708] AN ONSIDE KICK.
[ct=8435.879] IT HAS TO GO 10 YARDS.
[ct=8440.036] THEIR ONLY CHANCE RIGHT HERE.
[ct=8448.136] SO THERE HAVE BEEN 27 ONSIDE
[ct=8451.910] KICKS, OF WHICH TWO HAVE BEEN
[ct=8453.453] RECOVERED BY THE KICKING TEAM.
[ct=8454.660] THAT'S HOW TOUGH IT IS THESE
[ct=8457.273] BACK TO THE TWO POINTER WE GO.
[ct=8459.951] KIRK: THIS IS AFTER THE THROW
[ct=8461.203] AND THE TWO POINT CONVERSION.
[ct=8462.550] ANOTHER ONE.
[ct=8466.545] AND JOE DUTTON COMPLAIN VERY
[ct=8466.545] OFTEN.
[ct=8467.896] HE DIDN'T THERE.
[ct=8470.559] LOOK AT THAT FOLLOW-THROUGH.
[ct=8473.212] AND THEN YOU THROW THAT AND IS A
[ct=8474.608] KEY -- AND
[ct=8479.902] WHAT DO YOU SEE?
[ct=8483.844] >> IT WAS CLEARLY DEFENSIVE
[ct=8485.130] HOLDING BEFORE THE PASS WAS IN
[ct=8485.130] FLIGHT AND THAT LOOKS
[ct=8487.906] FORCIBLE CONTACT TO THE HEAD OF
[ct=8490.429] IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED.
[ct=8494.449] AL: TOO MANY GAMES END THIS WAY.
[ct=8498.403] AL: YOU MISSED CALLS, THE WHOLE
[ct=8501.070] THING, SO FRUSTRATING.
[ct=8510.653] HE RECOVERS THAT.
[ct=8514.607] AND IN A GAME THAT CAME CLOSE TO
[ct=8518.569] MATCHING THAT, THE RAVENS WILL
[ct=8519.914] DO IT AGAIN AND SWEEP THE
[ct=8521.223] SERIES.
[ct=8523.879] KIRK: BOTH THESE GAMES CLASSICS.
[ct=8526.518] BOTH THESE GAMES WERE EVERYTHING
[ct=8527.803] YOU LOVE TO SEE IN DIVISIONAL
[ct=8527.803] MATCHUPS.
[ct=8530.495] BALTIMORE, TO THEIR CREDIT, YOU
[ct=8534.493] KNOW, GREAT TEAMS FIND WAYS TO
[ct=8534.493] WIN GAMES.
[ct=8537.120] PEOPLE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT
[ct=8539.779] BOTH OF THOSE CALLS THERE ON THE
[ct=8539.779] TWO POINT CONVERSION.
[ct=8542.478] DOESN'T MEAN THEY WOULD HAVE
[ct=8545.076] ENDED UP WINNING THE GAM
[ct=8546.399] THEY WOULD HAVE DEFINITELY HAD
[ct=8547.817] ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=8547.817] AL: EVERY WEEK.
[ct=8554.352] THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE FINISH
[ct=8558.378] LINE AND TAKE THE BALTIMORE
[ct=8561.037] RAVENS TO A RECORD OF 7-3.
[ct=8565.020] THEIR NEXT GAME AT PITTSBURGH
[ct=8567.684] AGAINST THE DIVISION LEADERS AND
[ct=8571.677] THE BENGALS NOW ARE 4-6 AND IN
[ct=8575.632] DEEP TROUBLE IN TERMS OF THEIR
[ct=8575.632] PLAYOFF HOPES.
[ct=8581.001] 35-34, BURROW TONIGHT, FOUR
[ct=8583.607] TOUCHDOWN PASSES, 428 YARDS.
[ct=8587.581] JACKSON AND I, FOUR TOUCHDOWN
[ct=8591.587] PASSES, 200 -- JACKSON TONIGHT,
[ct=8594.250] FOUR TOUCHDOWN PASSES, 290
[ct=8596.965] THEY LIMITED HENRY TO 68.
[ct=8603.528] BUT THE RAVENS GAIN 389 YARDS.
[ct=8607.595] TONS OF OFFENSE BUT AT THE END
[ct=8610.279] OF THE DAY IT CAME DOWN TO THAT
[ct=8611.615] TWO POINT MISSED CONVERSION.
