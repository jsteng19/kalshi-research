[ct=0.559] [music playing]
[ct=0.799] FedEx Field.
[ct=1.791] The coaches.
[ct=2.992] First of all, the ways to watch.
[ct=3.123] We can tell you other ways to watch Prime Vision with Next
[ct=6.983] Gen Stats.
[ct=8.280] That broadcast on Spanish with TNF En Espanol.
[ct=12.197] Everybody's always talking about a coach on the hot seat.
[ct=14.914] You lose 14 in a row, obviously the seat is very hot.
[ct=18.893] Matt Eberflus second year, mark of 3 and 18,
[ct=24.098] trying to get into the wind column tonight.
[ct=26.885] His counterpart, Ron Rivera.
[ct=30.869] He's coaching in his fourth season
[ct=33.530] here, formerly at Carolina.
[ct=34.815] And, of course, he played for the Chicago Bears
[ct=37.628] and was part of the great Bears teams in the mid '80s.
[ct=46.770] Two quarterbacks, of course, you've
[ct=48.125] got Justin Fields, who was a first rounder,
[ct=52.002] in his third season, and this could be a season
[ct=54.811] to determine very much what his future will be as he comes
[ct=58.806] to midfield for the coin toss.
[ct=61.480] Sam Howell, a fifth round pick.
[ct=64.156] Normally, a fifth round pick is not
[ct=65.568] a guy you think is going to be a franchise quarterback.
[ct=69.473] You can only hope.
[ct=70.776] Ron Rivera after his only start a year ago as a rookie
[ct=73.403] that last game against Dallas came out in January
[ct=77.391] and said this is our guy.
[ct=78.793] We're moving forward into next year.
[ct=80.093] I a lot of people thought they may potentially
[ct=82.733] draft another quarterback.
[ct=84.092] Instead, they went with Sam Howell.
[ct=86.705] Now four games in, he showed some signs of--
[ct=90.693] Commanders fans being very excited
[ct=92.136] about his potential in this new scheme,
[ct=94.683] and we'll see how he gets off tonight out to a good start.
[ct=98.682] They had Carson Wentz.
[ct=100.019] Taylor Heinicke did a decent job.
[ct=102.675] He's gone.
[ct=104.084] So then this season, it was a matter
[ct=105.653] of whether Jacoby Brissett, who they picked up,
[ct=109.281] or Howell win the job in mid-August.
[ct=112.007] The job belongs to Howell.
[ct=114.629] Boy, he has demonstrated a lot of poise
[ct=115.952] here in his last couple of weeks.
[ct=117.817] Buffalo got after him for 9 sacks.
[ct=121.278] He bounced back against Philly and showed a lot of poise
[ct=123.919] in a loss, a close loss to the Eagles on the road.
[ct=127.934] Nice night just outside the District of Columbia.
[ct=130.583] Temperature is 70 degrees, light breeze.
[ct=135.939] Joey Slye to kick off.
[ct=137.177] Velus Jones back to receive at FedEx Field, home
[ct=143.897] of this franchise since 1997.
[ct=146.680] [cheering]
[ct=149.126] Week 5 is underway with a touchback.
[ct=154.491] So Fields coming off his best performance of his career
[ct=158.457] last week, certainly in the first half,
[ct=161.102] and then the second half a whole other story
[ct=163.773] with a very costly fumble, an interception.
[ct=166.412] But overall, there were the numbers, 4 TDs, the pick,
[ct=170.405] only 25 rushing yards for a guy who's been in triple figures
[ct=174.457] on occasion.
[ct=175.683] Yeah.
[ct=175.715] Last year, over 1,000 yards rushing.
[ct=177.019] And you know what we saw last week is
[ct=179.667] he made quick decisions.
[ct=181.032] They got him out on the edge.
[ct=181.223] They threatened with his legs and he
[ct=183.696] was able to complete his first 16 passes.
[ct=186.369] They got him in rhythm early.
[ct=187.663] Likes to line up as is the case here in the pistol.
[ct=190.328] The fake to Herbert.
[ct=191.637] Retreats, has time, goes deep, and off the hands of Darnell
[ct=197.141] Mooney, who'd beaten his man.
[ct=199.592] So Mooney got out in front.
[ct=200.933] Just couldn't handle it, and it'll be second down and 10.
[ct=204.920] Well, this offensive line, obviously like most,
[ct=207.585] performed better when they have a chance
[ct=209.305] to be first and 10 play action.
[ct=211.580] You see you get one on one opportunity, a clean pocket,
[ct=214.203] takes a shot, and just can't quite
[ct=216.901] hit his number one target a year ago, Darnell Mooney.
[ct=219.550] But this is what they're looking for, Luke Getsy.
[ct=222.165] Love the call here, taking that shot.
[ct=224.845] He had him one on one and he got behind coverage.
[ct=228.679] Beat Kendall Fuller.
[ct=231.502] Keep it on the ground.
[ct=232.848] Herbert goes nowhere.
[ct=234.122] Montez Sweat making the tackle there.
[ct=238.367] It'll be third down and 9.
[ct=239.479] So another guy under the gun has been Luke Getsy, the Bears
[ct=243.673] offensive coordinator.
[ct=245.069] He, again, trying to in a way revamp what Fields does
[ct=250.058] and what the offense does.
[ct=252.743] Just trying to find that rhythm, keeping in mind
[ct=253.318] they've got a rookie right tackle and their two starters
[ct=256.736] on the left side over these last couple of weeks,
[ct=258.051] left guard and left tackle not playing.
[ct=259.643] So it's made it tougher to get Fields into that rhythm.
[ct=264.663] They go 3 by 1 here.
[ct=267.390] Mooney in motion.
[ct=269.976] That's a great front four for Washington,
[ct=271.549] but the line does it job.
[ct=272.660] And open and making the catch inside the 30-yard line,
[ct=276.544] DJ Moore.
[ct=277.979] So they misfire on the first one but hit the second one.
[ct=281.966] Line did its job, Fields stayed in the pocket,
[ct=284.572] 57 yards over Benjamin St-Juste.
[ct=288.559] The pocket, when the pocket is clean,
[ct=291.291] like any quarterback, Justin Fields especially,
[ct=293.913] he's growing as a pocket quarterback.
[ct=295.250] You see how clean the pocket is there.
[ct=297.139] What he does is he do a good job of reading
[ct=300.519] the safety coming down.
[ct=301.069] Once he saw the safety come down,
[ct=303.228] realized he had a one on one opportunity, St-Juste.
[ct=305.876] gets it lost in coverage, and he makes 'em pay.
[ct=309.852] 58 yards officially, longest completion of the season.
[ct=316.472] Moore came over in the trade.
[ct=317.824] Meanwhile, a timeout is taken here just a minute and a half
[ct=323.137] into the game.
[ct=325.785] So he'll go to the bench, discuss it with Getsy.
[ct=329.789] But you've got to-- hey, what do you have to lose?
[ct=332.721] You're 0 and 4, you start with a bomb, misfire,
[ct=336.314] you come back with another bomb and you hit it.
[ct=337.751] It shows the confidence that they have in him,
[ct=340.392] and this looks like a safety that's going to drop, right?
[ct=343.026] With the snap of the ball, he comes down.
[ct=345.696] Justin Fields recognizes that.
[ct=347.154] Once he starts to sink, now he knows.
[ct=349.994] He recognizes that.
[ct=351.127] Now he knows he's got exactly what he wants.
[ct=353.781] As I said, St-Juste, 25, just kind of
[ct=356.328] gets lost there in coverage.
[ct=357.699] You don't know if that's a bust or what,
[ct=360.299] but obviously he should not be running free
[ct=362.957] like that on third down.
[ct=364.285] It's a 1-2 punch.
[ct=365.645] That's right.
[ct=366.966] Fields to Moore.
[ct=368.277] Herbert the back.
[ct=372.569] [play call]
[ct=373.607] Fields under center.
[ct=376.280] Herbert, nothing.
[ct=378.885] Again, you're going up against that front four of Washington.
[ct=382.872] You got Allen, you got Payne, you got Sweat,
[ct=385.691] and you got Young, all of them number one draft choices.
[ct=389.545] Even John Ridgeway, who's out there pushing people around,
[ct=393.527] I mean, they can consume offensive linemen,
[ct=396.324] allows their linebackers to get downhill.
[ct=398.846] It really frees up the back end when
[ct=400.503] you have a dominant front like that for Jack Del
[ct=403.012] Rio, the defensive coordinator.
[ct=408.149] Second and 10 from the 16-yard line.
[ct=413.437] Fields, look out.
[ct=414.794] Under pressure.
[ct=416.089] Down he goes 21-yard line.
[ct=417.537] Montez Sweat coming in.
[ct=420.105] That's his fourth sack of the season,
[ct=424.093] setting up third and long.
[ct=424.758] This is their fear.
[ct=425.493] You think you're going to have to chip tonight
[ct=428.048] against these ends.
[ct=428.320] Wright is just a rookie.
[ct=430.685] He's trying to hold on for dear life against a very
[ct=433.405] underrated defensive end.
[ct=434.767] People talk a lot about Chase Young,
[ct=436.676] Daron Payne, Jonathan Allen.
[ct=438.768] Sometimes, you overlook the game-changing ability
[ct=442.744] of Montez Sweat against the run, and here
[ct=444.334] getting that great pass rush off the edge.
[ct=448.527] 18 sacks, second most in the league.
[ct=452.526] Third and 14.
[ct=455.254] Four-man rush again.
[ct=459.024] Fields to the end zone.
[ct=460.335] Moore, touchdown.
[ct=464.341] So Fields, who had the big first half last week, 20 yards here,
[ct=468.523] down the field they go, 4 catches, 2 passes, 6 plays,
[ct=472.497] 75 yards in a little less than three minutes, and Chicago
[ct=476.707] draws first blood.
[ct=477.627] But watch Percy Butler, the safety.
[ct=479.037] When you have a vertical receiver against two safeties
[ct=482.938] that are high, the linebackers got to be able to get vertical.
[ct=485.626] Watch the safety be influenced here,
[ct=488.222] and that creates the opening to the outside.
[ct=490.887] Again, give Justin Fields a lot of credit.
[ct=493.520] That throw should not be there if the safety is doing his job.
[ct=496.321] And again, he makes him pay on the back end.
[ct=500.268] Extra point by Cairo Santos is good,
[ct=504.117] and just like that on Thursday night Chicago, 7, Washington,
[ct=516.166] Some people just know what road to take.
[ct=518.752] Those are the people who to choose Allstate.
[ct=521.478] The surface road is faster.
[ct=524.249] Turn left.
[ct=525.403] Not happening.
[ct=525.582] He knows better than any GPS, and he'd point you
[ct=529.395] in Allstate's direction.
[ct=529.452] Go all the way down the road past the big gray warehouse.
[ct=533.371] You're not from around here, so you don't know the back roads.
[ct=535.983] I don't want to be late for the party.
[ct=537.451] I'm going to save us five minutes.
[ct=541.321] You're on the fastest route.
[ct=542.682] Those are the people who know safe drivers save
[ct=545.319] 40% with Allstate.
[ct=546.650] Critics everywhere agree The Creator
[ct=549.329] is the best film of the year.
[ct=550.645] Joshua, take care of it.
[ct=551.950] It's visually stunning and a cinematic masterpiece.
[ct=554.624] I promise to keep us safe.
[ct=555.923] See this film on the biggest screen possible.
[ct=558.649] The Creator, Rated PG-13 and now playing.
[ct=563.935] (RAPPING) We got London on the track.
[ct=566.584] This means I'm war-ready.
[ct=570.511] We come face to face.
[ct=571.887] So if we going to play, we going to play for keeps.
[ct=577.231] We ain't going to stop.
[ct=579.841] We're going to protect this house.
[ct=581.929] Win it out.
[ct=582.488] We protect this house.
[ct=585.185] In the trunk, we're going to protect this house.
[ct=587.972] Against the clout, we're going to protect this house.
[ct=591.813] This month, join the new Subway MVP Rewards Program
[ct=594.617] and get rewarded.
[ct=595.795] Get 50% off any footlong when you join Subway MVP Rewards.
[ct=599.789] So many all-star options.
[ct=600.904] It's just for Subway MVPs, right?
[ct=602.509] You catch on quick, Herbert.
[ct=603.748] Join now and get 50% off any footlong.
[ct=606.436] [whistle blowing]
[ct=607.719] People don't always know how to ask for help,
[ct=609.414] but I believe if we can help we should help.
[ct=614.388] OK, here we go.
[ct=615.731] I got this.
[ct=617.485] I'm good, Tim.
[ct=619.705] Keep her coming.
[ct=621.052] Hey, we're going to finish this thing, all right?
[ct=622.489] Me and you together.
[ct=623.725] Sometimes people need help asking for help.
[ct=626.635] Righty tighty.
[ct=629.039] That's not coming off.
[ct=632.939] Pickle jar is stuck again.
[ct=633.969] Do you need help, Barry?
[ct=635.621] Only for Prime members.
[ct=638.312] Family Fright Night is on Prime Video
[ct=639.621] this Halloween with hit movies like Hotel Transylvania 4
[ct=643.686] in one app, one password.
[ct=645.363] Find your Halloween happy place on Prime Video.
[ct=648.876] God forbid we ever get booked into the Hotel Transylvania 4.
[ct=653.361] Anyway, there's your United States Capitol.
[ct=656.898] An interesting thing happened after the coin toss.
[ct=660.850] Normally, teams defer almost all the time these days.
[ct=663.542] Chicago won the toss, elected to receive.
[ct=666.343] They're going to be aggressive right from the start.
[ct=668.807] They proved that on that first drive.
[ct=671.526] I mean, they really went after it,
[ct=672.785] continue to trust their quarterback, Justin Fields.
[ct=675.492] You can see why, the potential.
[ct=677.008] It's never been about his physical ability.
[ct=680.791] It's just trying to get him to fit
[ct=681.220] into this scheme and the scheme to fit into his skill set.
[ct=686.116] That's why you get excited about the potential of what
[ct=689.276] he can do.
[ct=690.109] All right, our first look right now.
[ct=691.444] Sam Howell played his college ball
[ct=694.071] at North Carolina, picked in the fifth round.
[ct=698.062] They liked him as a sophomore.
[ct=699.421] I mean, Ron Rivera telling us about how good he looked.
[ct=703.332] Comes out after his junior year.
[ct=706.029] We mentioned not often do you find a franchise quarterback
[ct=709.675] in the fifth.
[ct=710.033] Sometimes, you do find him in the sixth round out of Michigan
[ct=712.680] though.
[ct=714.020] [laughter]
[ct=716.776] Start from the 25 out of the gun.
[ct=721.929] On the ground plowing ahead.
[ct=724.629] Nice run there.
[ct=725.939] Brian Robinson their leading ground-gainer picking up 6.
[ct=729.933] It'll be second down and 4.
[ct=731.228] And Howell is an interesting story.
[ct=732.602] Those first two years at North Carolina in that system,
[ct=736.555] He had a lot of talent around him, a lot of NFL talent
[ct=739.372] around him.
[ct=740.552] They all left after his second year.
[ct=741.921] So his third year, he's breaking in a lot of new people
[ct=744.433] around him, and his production dipped down,
[ct=747.217] and that's why I think he slid down.
[ct=748.846] But this guy has a ton of ability
[ct=751.030] and plays a tremendous poise.
[ct=752.342] 92 TDs in three years with the Tar Heels, and that
[ct=756.431] should be a first down on a pass here
[ct=758.955] to the tight end, Logan Thomas.
[ct=760.633] See where they spot it.
[ct=761.598] They're going to spot it just a little bit
[ct=764.287] short of the 35-yard line.
[ct=765.579] So third down and short now.
[ct=768.257] Stevenson covering on the play.
[ct=769.609] I think with Ron Rivera, he wanted
[ct=772.232] to find a quarterback that could just
[ct=773.551] be a distributor, a guy that processes quickly
[ct=776.399] and can get the ball out to the wealth of talent
[ct=781.517] that they have on the perimeter in the backfield.
[ct=784.249] And they feel that Howell can be that guy.
[ct=787.112] Good receivers.
[ct=788.130] Terry McLaurin is terrific.
[ct=789.475] They have Jahan Dotson, Curtis Samuel.
[ct=792.694] Thomas can catch, as he did on the last play,
[ct=796.086] and he's stuffed in the backfield.
[ct=797.437] So on third and short, Andrew Billings, number 97,
[ct=804.072] envelops Robinson.
[ct=806.757] And it's fourth down.
[ct=808.094] Nick Gates, the center, just gets dominated here
[ct=812.245] by Billings in his quickness.
[ct=814.708] He works to the left and just loses his balance.
[ct=817.471] And I tell you what, Billings does flash on film.
[ct=821.350] He's a he's an undersized guy, 311 pounds.
[ct=824.216] So he's got a great lower body strength
[ct=827.993] to be able to show a kind of quickness
[ct=829.480] he has, but he shot that gap there.
[ct=831.992] That was a heck of a play.
[ct=837.312] Fourth and 2.
[ct=837.500] Tress Way comes in.
[ct=839.937] Trent Taylor standing back at his own 20 for Chicago.
[ct=851.872] Taylor backs up, fields at the 15,
[ct=857.204] runs it back about 11 yards, and that's
[ct=859.876] where Fields will set up shop as we look at 1600 Pennsylvania
[ct=865.202] Avenue on this Thursday night outside the Nation's Capitol.
[ct=875.589] DraftKings, you're spoiling me now with these big payouts.

[ct=919.440] Theo's nose was cause for alarm, so dad brought Puffs Plus
[ct=923.441] lotion to save it from harm.
[ct=924.742] Puffs has 50% more lotion and brings soothing relief.
[ct=927.361] Don't get burned by winter nose.
[ct=928.697] A nose in need deserves Puffs indeed, America's number one
[ct=932.674] lotion tissue.
[ct=934.023] (SINGING) To you.
[ct=935.347] I wish for the amazing new iPhone 15 Pro.
[ct=936.930] Sean, do you mean this one, the one with titanium?
[ct=940.688] No way.
[ct=940.984] I can trade this busted up thing for one maybe.
[ct=943.292] Stealing wishes from the birthday boy's
[ct=944.668] not your best plan.
[ct=944.912] Switch to Verizon and trade in any iPhone
[ct=947.275] and get the new iPhone 15 Pro on them.
[ct=950.007] Yep, and on an amazing Network.
[ct=951.262] And I don't have to ruin any more birthday parties.
[ct=955.171] That ship has sailed.
[ct=955.215] Let's go get you that iPhone.
[ct=956.509] Here we go.
[ct=957.834] Trade in any iPhone in any condition for a new iPhone 15
[ct=961.078] Pro on us only on Verizon.
[ct=963.164] When we said we'd make the skies bluer, some said keep dreaming.
[ct=967.111] So we did, lowering emissions on the road to zero.
[ct=972.435] Now we're working on an EV that has wings.
[ct=975.105] And someday, we'll turn your old Honda into your brand new Honda
[ct=980.403] because we are a company of dreamers, setting out
[ct=984.408] to be carbon neutral by 2050.
[ct=985.332] So no matter where we go, we're going to keep dreaming.

[ct=1004.253] You're watching Thursday Night Football only on Prime.
[ct=1010.694] FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland.
[ct=1017.301] The first Thursday night of the month of October.
[ct=1021.286] This week of the NFL season commencing with this one.
[ct=1025.273] Mentioned Chicago deciding to take the ball, not defer.
[ct=1029.663] How often do teams defer?
[ct=1032.097] 91% of the time.
[ct=1033.924] It paid off.
[ct=1034.543] Come up for their second drive here from the 26-yard line.
[ct=1039.855] Fields is going to keep it, has blocking as well,
[ct=1043.908] and takes it about 7 yards.
[ct=1045.191] That's what they want to do is get him on the edge.
[ct=1046.703] This first drive just tuning in.
[ct=1049.164] Al mentioned it.
[ct=1049.881] An aggressive mindset.
[ct=1050.476] Number one, they take the ball after winning the toss.
[ct=1053.165] Number two, they put the ball in the hands of Justin Fields.
[ct=1056.633] Most importantly, gave him room to work.
[ct=1060.354] And Justin Fields, the quarterback, like most of them
[ct=1061.867] out there, when they feel comfortable what's
[ct=1064.334] in front of them, able to focus downfield and make
[ct=1067.040] great throws like that.
[ct=1068.316] Could not have been a better way to start this game than what
[ct=1071.016] they did that opening drive for Justin and the Bears.
[ct=1076.211] After a 7-yard gain, second down and 3.
[ct=1080.163] Fires, caught.
[ct=1081.497] Making the grab at the 40-yard line.
[ct=1084.164] Robert Tonyan, longtime Green Bay Packer,
[ct=1086.804] came over as a free agent in the offseason.
[ct=1089.497] The other thing you see, and I think
[ct=1090.854] it's a carryover from last week, you
[ct=1092.730] got to give Luke Getsy a lot of credit,
[ct=1094.790] the ball is getting out fast, much faster
[ct=1097.601] than it was earlier in this year.
[ct=1100.145] And it just tells you that they're
[ct=1101.448] building this scheme around Justin Fields where
[ct=1104.968] he's comfortable.
[ct=1105.007] When a quarterback is comfortable and he has answers,
[ct=1108.103] you could see it in the way his eyes are working
[ct=1109.440] and how quickly the ball gets out,
[ct=1110.695] and that's kind of that mode he's playing in right now.
[ct=1118.971] Line does its job again.
[ct=1120.034] The catch, though, is not made by Darnell Mooney.
[ct=1125.070] Out of his range.
[ct=1126.357] Second down and 10.
[ct=1127.663] Al, nobody on this Bears team is hiding from this losing streak.
[ct=1131.635] Justin Fields understands the reality of it all.
[ct=1134.305] Darnell Mooney told me with each loss
[ct=1135.637] it seems like Fields gets even more locked in and intense,
[ct=1139.600] determined to turn this around.
[ct=1140.944] He said you can see it on the quarterback's face
[ct=1143.595] and how he communicates.
[ct=1144.932] And Mooney said no matter whether you
[ct=1146.251] have a good or a bad day at practice,
[ct=1147.820] Fields is also the guy always cheering the guys on.
[ct=1152.851] Kept a positive attitude.
[ct=1154.511] Much easier said than done.
[ct=1156.981] Ain't easy.
[ct=1159.347] Pass to the outside.
[ct=1160.737] Nice move to the inside, and then DJ Moore a little short
[ct=1165.887] of the first down.
[ct=1167.202] Remember, Chicago had the number one pick in the draft,
[ct=1169.880] traded it to Carolina.
[ct=1171.208] They wanted to get Bryce Young and they did.
[ct=1172.489] And this guy also went in as part of the trade,
[ct=1175.179] and Carolina didn't want to get rid of him obviously.
[ct=1179.210] But to make the deal, they had to get him.
[ct=1181.088] Yeah, and now he's so versatile.
[ct=1184.464] Meanwhile, third and 1, and they're
[ct=1184.772] going to try to run the tush push here as they
[ct=1188.924] got to the line in a hurry.
[ct=1191.124] And where are they going to mark this thing?
[ct=1192.996] First down.
[ct=1195.132] He kept driving his legs.
[ct=1196.299] But the great thing about DJ Moore,
[ct=1197.436] it gives him a legit number one receiver.
[ct=1200.016] That's why they went out and got him,
[ct=1200.867] and this is Justin Fields using his power.
[ct=1203.868] People forget he's 6' 3," about 230 pounds.
[ct=1206.485] So he is a powerful quarterback.
[ct=1209.132] He's still in the middle of this.
[ct=1210.668] Like watch him.
[ct=1211.861] He doesn't go down.
[ct=1211.991] Watch him continue.
[ct=1213.121] He keeps moving guys.
[ct=1214.460] He's not done.
[ct=1215.808] See him there at the top continue that leg drive.
[ct=1217.137] It's like a Jalen Hurts style of quarterback sneak there.
[ct=1223.782] As we mentioned, I'm sure the competition committee
[ct=1226.450] and the meetings next year are going to look at that play
[ct=1229.081] because, I mean, it's the ugliest play in football.
[ct=1231.733] But it's effective.
[ct=1233.046] But to finish on Moore, he can catch those quick throws yards
[ct=1235.768] after the catch, but they're going
[ct=1237.047] to want to take shots downfield today to him as well.
[ct=1243.629] Fields, get him out of the pocket, throws.
[ct=1247.637] Grabbed by Tonyan.
[ct=1249.808] Out of bounds right there at the--
[ct=1251.731] after about a 2-yard gain, that time
[ct=1254.344] Chase Young chasing Fields.
[ct=1256.955] This is a game within a game of the ends.
[ct=1259.627] Chase Young on one side, Montez Sweat on the other.
[ct=1262.284] They're going to line up wide, and their whole goal
[ct=1264.932] is we got to keep Justin Fields in the pocket.
[ct=1266.269] Nobody knows that better than Chase Young, who
[ct=1268.966] was a teammate with Justin Fields in 2019
[ct=1272.888] at Ohio State and good friends.
[ct=1274.259] So he, of course, is going to try
[ct=1275.616] to do the best he can to harass his good friend.
[ct=1280.873] He's been a problem the last couple of years.
[ct=1282.418] Meanwhile, big hole exploited on the right side.
[ct=1286.194] Herbert inside the 15-yard line.
[ct=1291.490] Tony Barton saved a touchdown.
[ct=1292.940] Wright and Davis, the right guard and right
[ct=1296.518] tackle, providing a huge hole.
[ct=1299.340] The motion really affects this defense,
[ct=1302.020] and they bust the gap control.
[ct=1304.703] Good job by this offensive line, not just in protection,
[ct=1307.329] but a good job of climbing up to that second level,
[ct=1309.955] and they're protecting the edges because of the threat
[ct=1312.660] of the quarterback.
[ct=1312.991] And it opens up the middle.
[ct=1316.663] Gain of 34.
[ct=1317.937] Fields just fires that one away.
[ct=1320.647] Being chased there.
[ct=1323.287] Tick under six minutes to go in the opening first quarter,
[ct=1325.943] which has been all Chicago.
[ct=1328.608] It's the short week every week on Thursday night.
[ct=1331.247] But in this short week, Ron Rivera
[ct=1333.437] knows that his defense with Jack Del Rio, they've
[ct=1336.585] got to stop the threat of Fields running.
[ct=1339.247] Anybody who defends Chicago, the first thing they talk about
[ct=1341.860] is we've got to take care of the edges.
[ct=1348.495] and Chicago knows that, and they've put together
[ct=1349.944] a nice plan there to try to take advantage
[ct=1352.457] of those edges being protected.
[ct=1356.446] Play action.
[ct=1360.414] Cole Kmet loses the ball.
[ct=1363.137] The man has scored 2 touchdowns last week, hit by Daron Payne,
[ct=1368.419] and a scramble to find out who's at the bottom of that pile.
[ct=1372.628] Daron Payne retracing, and he brought that right club
[ct=1379.069] to try to get that football away from the big tight end.
[ct=1383.050] Kmet is 6' 6," 260.
[ct=1384.521] Look at this club.
[ct=1385.682] Bang!
[ct=1387.053] Knocks that ball loose.
[ct=1388.314] It's on the ground, and Kmet very
[ct=1389.698] fortunate it just ends up right underneath him
[ct=1392.330] and he's able to secure it.
[ct=1395.014] How about that retrace by the big fella?
[ct=1400.289] Right under the right hamstring.
[ct=1402.975] Keeps possession.
[ct=1404.259] Third and 9.
[ct=1411.962] They go 5 wide here.
[ct=1414.599] Pass is caught.
[ct=1415.944] And trying to get that first down backing toward the line
[ct=1418.591] to gain but a little short is Cole Kmet once again.
[ct=1425.216] So fourth down and 1.
[ct=1425.784] The Commanders do a good job of anticipating that route.
[ct=1429.211] Keep the big tight end short of the first down.
[ct=1431.870] But if you're a Bears fan, first possession you go down,
[ct=1434.529] put a touchdown on the board.
[ct=1435.855] And now, you've got a shot at a field goal to go up 10-0.
[ct=1438.522] This is a team that was up big last week
[ct=1440.895] and couldn't hold on against Denver,
[ct=1442.462] and they're getting points here early playing aggressively.
[ct=1445.117] Again, not that aggressively otherwise
[ct=1449.106] you'd be going for it right here.
[ct=1450.452] Right.
[ct=1453.114] 22-yard field goal attempt is good.
[ct=1458.437] So they gained 145 yards to 8 for Washington
[ct=1462.421] early on as the Bears hot in the first half
[ct=1466.414] again take a 10-0 advantage.
[ct=1475.731] Gotta try this Axe.
[ct=1477.012] It's the fine fragrance GOAT.
[ct=1485.204] Axe Fine Fragrance Collection.
[ct=1486.322] Smell finer than the finest fragrances with the GOAT.
[ct=1511.670] Pause for hydration.
[ct=1515.502] Stop for nothing.
[ct=1517.338] Essentia.
[ct=1519.512] Patrick, Jake from State Farm, explain this bundling thing
[ct=1523.521] again.
[ct=1526.163] your car, right?
[ct=1527.464] Uh-huh.
[ct=1528.834] And this burger is your home.
[ct=1531.454] OK.
[ct=1531.553] It can be more affordable if you bundle them together.
[ct=1534.374] Kind of like a combo meal.
[ct=1538.148] Mmm.
[ct=1538.246] Explain it again with those nuggies.
[ct=1542.100] Bundling, just another way to save with the Personal Price
[ct=1545.141] Plan.
[ct=1546.039] Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[ct=1548.736] (SINGING) Only $5, Whopper Jr times two.
[ct=1551.429] Double the Jr.'s.
[ct=1552.737] That's your cue.
[ct=1553.105] One for you, one for your friend to go.
[ct=1555.480] JK, you ate them both.
[ct=1556.751] They'll never know.
[ct=1557.991] BK, it have it your way.
[ct=1562.244] You rule.
[ct=1567.319] Catch NFL+.
[ct=1568.658] I catch NFL Network, and I catch every touchdown every Sunday
[ct=1572.707] afternoon on NFL RedZone.
[ct=1575.320] Catch it all on NFL+.
[ct=1576.627] For a limited time, get 50% off a yearly--
[ct=1581.911] Well, a lot of one term quarterbacks here
[ct=1584.641] in our Nation's Captiol.
[ct=1584.886] Since 2017, Kirk Cousins was here.
[ct=1588.605] He was one of three starting quarterbacks
[ct=1589.903] that year in each of the last five seasons.
[ct=1592.583] They've used at least three starting quarterbacks.
[ct=1596.929] And now Sam Howell is the man at the podium.
[ct=1600.548] Fourth youngest active starting quarterback at 23.
[ct=1605.838] Just turned 23 last month.
[ct=1608.539] So, you know, you're always looking for that franchise guy.
[ct=1612.461] Who in the world would believe all of those seasons not only
[ct=1616.430] two starting quarterbacks, but three
[ct=1619.138] in every one of those years?
[ct=1620.441] And we were talking this morning.
[ct=1620.832] You go back to Sonny Jurgensen and Billy Kilmer and Joe
[ct=1624.571] Theismann.
[ct=1625.763] What, they had a good 20, 25-year run
[ct=1627.140] with just three guys.
[ct=1628.583] And since then, boy, it's been a lot of different quarterback
[ct=1635.075] chances and opportunities.
[ct=1636.418] Santos will send that one through the end zone.
[ct=1643.041] And down 10 to 0.
[ct=1643.131] Washington will start from the 25-yard line.
[ct=1647.042] Look at those names.
[ct=1648.324] Mark Rypien of course had a good run.
[ct=1651.057] Kirk Cousins was here and got things going,
[ct=1653.660] but you see after 57 games he is now in Minnesota.
[ct=1658.995] Well, over a decade ago there's Robert Griffin at the bottom.
[ct=1661.620] At one point, man, he looked like he was the guy.
[ct=1664.254] That was the answer.
[ct=1664.942] And he got hurt, Mike Shanahan was here,
[ct=1666.890] and here's Eric Bieniemy, a great story in it of himself.
[ct=1669.893] He comes over here as the offensive coordinator.
[ct=1674.900] From the 25-yard line.
[ct=1679.219] Howell surveying, looking, decides to take off.
[ct=1682.749] With Bieniemy, I mean, obviously he's
[ct=1685.059] been interviewed for a head coaching jobs all
[ct=1687.681] I don't know how many times now, but he was always
[ct=1689.702] under the shadow of Andy Reid.
[ct=1690.539] And the knock was, wait a second, Andy is the offense.
[ct=1693.518] Andy calls the plays.
[ct=1694.288] So Eric decides, hey man, I got to get out of that shadow,
[ct=1697.212] and Ron Rivera hires him.
[ct=1699.574] I think anytime you want to have an opportunity to become a head
[ct=1701.334] coach and you're an offensive-minded guy
[ct=1703.577] and you're working for an offensive head coach,
[ct=1706.245] you do have to go out and do your own thing.
[ct=1708.888] This is a huge chance here with this offense,
[ct=1710.330] and he's very optimistic about what they can do this year.
[ct=1714.391] You'll hear from Scott Novak, our referee, for the first time
[ct=1722.210] False start, offense, number 3.
[ct=1724.846] That's a 5-yard penalty.
[ct=1725.571] Second down.
[ct=1728.810] Byron Pringle batting himself on the helmet.
[ct=1732.825] And if you look around the quarterback position,
[ct=1734.176] we talked earlier about McLaurin and Curtis Samuel and Dotson,
[ct=1738.148] who they picked up, Dyami Brown.
[ct=1739.443] In the backfield, Brian Robinson, Antonio Gibson.
[ct=1742.317] There's a lot of skill to work with.
[ct=1744.815] The big thing is can Sam Howell deliver
[ct=1748.744] and be able to be the guy.
[ct=1750.080] Robinson, the defense does its job again.
[ct=1756.737] Short gain right there.
[ct=1758.006] Yannick Ngakoue, DeMarcus Walker both there.
[ct=1760.947] It'll be third and 11.
[ct=1762.191] This is a defense that has struggled.
[ct=1765.996] This is a group that has not done a great job of getting off
[ct=1771.311] They're dead last in third down defense.
[ct=1772.869] Not done a good job of pressuring opposing
[ct=1775.429] quarterbacks.
[ct=1776.561] Dead last in the NFL.
[ct=1777.198] Only 2 sacks.
[ct=1777.881] So right now, I don't know if they're feeling it
[ct=1780.489] because of the way their own offense is playing,
[ct=1781.826] but they're aggressive themselves.
[ct=1783.429] Well, Allen Williams was the defensive coordinator.
[ct=1786.132] He had to resign.
[ct=1787.175] So Eberflus is now calling the defense.
[ct=1791.129] Third down and 11.
[ct=1792.519] Deep drop.
[ct=1792.743] Howell is going to take off and not go very far.
[ct=1796.479] DeMarcus Walker is there again.
[ct=1799.112] So the Washington Commanders, 3 and out
[ct=1803.089] on their first two drives, still do not have a first down.
[ct=1807.028] Have been outgained 145 yards to 12.
[ct=1809.727] Bring a blitz here and the safety instead of dropping,
[ct=1813.735] he ends up coming down.
[ct=1815.105] So they're trying to confuse this young quarterback, which
[ct=1817.684] he thought they would do.
[ct=1819.063] It's a smart thing to do pre-snap
[ct=1820.389] to post-snap, giving him different looks, especially
[ct=1824.316] on third down.
[ct=1828.318] Way, his second punt.
[ct=1830.985] Trent Taylor waiting for it.
[ct=1836.411] Drifting.
[ct=1837.623] Makes the grab, avoids the first man,
[ct=1840.272] and he takes it back out to the 31-yard line.
[ct=1844.339] 1:52 remaining in the opening quarter.
[ct=1848.302] 10 to 0, Chicago.
[ct=1856.287] LeBron stands alone.
[ct=1861.617] 5, 4, 3, 2.
[ct=1864.284] Goal.
[ct=1866.899] Are you not entertained?
[ct=1868.264] He just brought the house down.
[ct=1872.230] What a play.
[ct=1873.574] This is March.
[ct=1876.200] Put you front row.
[ct=1878.867] Are you kidding me?
[ct=1884.206] This is a clustomer.
[ct=1885.538] It happens when marketers group all their customers together.
[ct=1889.501] Mailchimp uses real time behavior data
[ct=1892.162] so you can personalize email for every customer.
[ct=1894.787] Turn clustomers into customers with Intuit Mailchimp.
[ct=1898.753] Have you ever noticed how tourism commercials
[ct=1900.121] use camera angles to make things look big and exciting?
[ct=1904.581] They make you think, wow, that looks like an epic vacation.
[ct=1910.958] Is it working?
[ct=1913.410] How about now?
[ct=1914.734] You don't need to use camera magic to make
[ct=1917.389] this vacation look exciting.
[ct=1918.690] It actually is.
[ct=1920.835] This is our go big or go home trip to Texas.
[ct=1924.291] Go get your own.
[ct=1929.302] 6' 5," 324 catches, 20 carries, all the Sauce.
[ct=1938.619] In this game, numbers are everything, so call yours.
[ct=1949.330] I'm war-ready.
[ct=1954.185] So if we going to play we going to play for keeps.
[ct=1961.026] We going to protect this house.
[ct=1963.385] When it doubt, we going to protect his house.
[ct=1966.027] In the trunk, we going to protect this house.
[ct=1976.474] A week from tonight, Thursday Night Football,
[ct=1978.686] we're going to Kansas City.
[ct=1979.854] That means Patrick Mahomes against the Broncos
[ct=1984.406] Broncos affecting the huge comeback against Chicago.
[ct=1988.375] I think Travis Kelce will be there.
[ct=1989.714] God knows who else next week in Kansas City.
[ct=1995.073] Meanwhile here, a couple of changes.
[ct=1997.688] Offensively, you got Tevin Jenkins comes in.
[ct=2000.268] He's been hurt and he's going to take over
[ct=2003.011] at left guard for Cody White here.
[ct=2005.672] Talking about Chase Claypool in our introduction tonight.
[ct=2009.645] Not here, of course, for the second straight game
[ct=2012.294] and told to basically stay home.
[ct=2014.878] Leshon Johnson is now in the backfield.
[ct=2019.973] Moore, great spin move to the inside.
[ct=2022.586] Off he goes again.
[ct=2023.980] What a first half for him.
[ct=2024.717] And finally, after he breaks the tackle of the rookie, Forbes,
[ct=2029.468] another long-gainer.
[ct=2030.842] And another first and 10 pass, play action pass,
[ct=2034.560] for the Bears and Luke Getsy, and it's a great job.
[ct=2037.205] You've got to beat the rookie one on one.
[ct=2038.667] One of the top receivers, nice little push off,
[ct=2041.267] gets away with it.
[ct=2042.560] Yards after the catch has got to be something
[ct=2045.349] the Bears can do tonight, and there's a great example
[ct=2049.137] of that by number 2.
[ct=2051.859] On the ground.
[ct=2052.124] Man, you've got DJ Moore on your fantasy league,
[ct=2057.071] he's already gone for 126 yards.
[ct=2062.366] Go to the caviar jar.
[ct=2063.838] That's not bad.
[ct=2064.985] He had a great game last week too when
[ct=2067.657] they went against Denver where he ended up having
[ct=2070.249] over 100 yards receiving.
[ct=2071.640] So he's clearly their guy.
[ct=2072.979] I'll tell you, Luke Getsy he's got
[ct=2074.271] to feel really good about this plan
[ct=2075.587] right now, mixing up formations, personnel groupings,
[ct=2078.267] pre-snap movement, and has a quarterback that's in his own.
[ct=2083.547] Second and 5.
[ct=2087.431] Another big hole.
[ct=2088.799] Another big gain.
[ct=2089.992] That's Roschon Johnson, a rookie picked in the fourth round out
[ct=2095.349] How about that offensive line?
[ct=2096.673] You mentioned Jenkins coming in.
[ct=2097.948] He gets going here early getting involved.
[ct=2101.561] He'll get up here.
[ct=2101.716] You'll see the left tackle able to climb up.
[ct=2103.268] Larry Borum opens up that hole, and I love Johnson.
[ct=2107.262] Just a downhill runner, puts his foot in the ground,
[ct=2111.253] and builds up that momentum.
[ct=2112.590] And what a collision with Derek Forrest there.
[ct=2116.419] That Bears offensive line missing two starters
[ct=2119.154] at the outset.
[ct=2119.155] Rookie right tackle dominating the line of scrimmage.
[ct=2123.257] Waning seconds of the quarter.
[ct=2132.511] Gets it away, just flings it and flings it out of bounds.
[ct=2135.330] So Chase Young almost got him, couldn't, and that's
[ct=2139.571] the way the first quarter ends.
[ct=2141.830] Paul--
[ct=2141.934] There is no foul for intentional grounding.
[ct=2144.554] Second down, and this is the end of the first quarter.
[ct=2148.345] They wanted international, do not get it.
[ct=2149.848] End of the quarter.
[ct=2151.045] 10 to 0, Bears, and back right after these messages.
[ct=2160.294] For 120 years at JCPenney, we believed
[ct=2164.331] if you're going to do something, do it all the way.
[ct=2166.994] We give 100% every day because it's who we are
[ct=2172.272] and who you are too.
[ct=2173.631] So seize the moment.
[ct=2174.962] Get the suit that lands the job.
[ct=2177.616] Set the table that brings you together.
[ct=2178.906] Wear the red that brightens the room.
[ct=2181.574] And give the ring that changes everything.
[ct=2184.328] Every day is a new opportunity.
[ct=2188.213] JCPenney, make it count.
[ct=2190.850] Man, I wish I was out there.
[ct=2193.527] Let's un-retire.
[ct=2194.837] Why not?
[ct=2196.185] (SINGING) Guess who's back, back again?
[ct=2201.539] Dan Marino?
[ct=2203.013] You all right?
[ct=2204.158] 22, 22.
[ct=2209.469] Delay of game, number 13.
[ct=2213.474] I'm good right here, bro.
[ct=2217.418] Should we?
[ct=2217.504] Don't even think about it.
[ct=2225.440] How can you tell which one's the better deal?
[ct=2228.075] Bring in dad from Sarasota.
[ct=2232.040] US Marine Corps War Memorial with the Washington Monument
[ct=2236.426] in the background on this Thursday night.
[ct=2240.025] Al Michaels with Kirk Herbstreit, Kaylee Hartung.
[ct=2242.662] Our rules expert is Terry McAulay.
[ct=2245.348] We're going to weigh in a second with Terry
[ct=2246.924] on that last play of the first quarter.
[ct=2251.965] The Commanders wanted intentional grounding.
[ct=2257.256] Meanwhile, second down and 10 now.
[ct=2258.632] A little flip here to Johnson for the 10.
[ct=2261.511] Terry, what did you see on that last play?
[ct=2263.998] Well Al, he never got outside the pocket.
[ct=2265.398] So he's got to get the ball in the vicinity of receiver.
[ct=2268.266] He's contacted before he starts his throwing motion.
[ct=2273.304] He clearly throws it away from any receiver well out
[ct=2277.253] of bounds.
[ct=2277.569] This should have been a foul for intentional grounding.
[ct=2281.237] Chase Young looking at his former teammate
[ct=2283.936] like what the heck.
[ct=2285.333] What's going on here?
[ct=2286.580] Ron Rivera was heated while we were at break about it as well.
[ct=2291.918] Yeah?
[ct=2293.216] Shaved a few yards.
[ct=2294.200] Third down and 6.
[ct=2302.516] Reaching up.
[ct=2302.566] Does he make the catch again?
[ct=2303.910] DJ Moore, touchdown.
[ct=2309.162] He is having a career in one night.
[ct=2312.092] Beats Kendall Fuller again.
[ct=2313.775] That's 11 yards for the touchdown.
[ct=2315.838] He's already caught 5 for 137 and 2 scores.
[ct=2319.826] How about the throw by Justin Fields?
[ct=2321.304] A little slant and go.
[ct=2323.437] Fuller never locates the football.
[ct=2324.883] And Moore so comfortable being able to get his feet down.
[ct=2328.769] Watch this route.
[ct=2329.199] Watch Fuller bite on it man to man.
[ct=2331.666] Ooh!
[ct=2332.744] A little inside move, and the throw
[ct=2334.071] could not have been any better by Justin Fields.
[ct=2340.730] What were you saying about fantasy for DJ Moore?
[ct=2343.507] Wow.
[ct=2344.722] What a night in the first 16 minutes of the game.
[ct=2349.351] 17-0, and we will be back, we promise, in 30 seconds.
[ct=2367.200] (RAPPING) California on my license plate.
[ct=2369.570] Last year, they ain't even like the back.
[ct=2375.141] The wheel never trips.
[ct=2376.514] Those guys back there.
[ct=2377.044] Knowing we never choke on that bill.
[ct=2379.319] No I can't quit.
[ct=2382.074] Put me on son.
[ct=2389.737] If you're a Bears fan, if you're a half full guy, you go wow.
[ct=2395.079] Look at this, if you're a half empty guy,
[ct=2396.374] you're going we saw this last week.
[ct=2399.047] How about the start of this game with what the Bears have done
[ct=2403.061] offensively and what we've not seen
[ct=2404.868] at all from the Commanders?
[ct=2407.024] You compare this total plays.
[ct=2409.699] Look at the yards, the first downs, two 3 and outs
[ct=2413.788] for the Commanders.
[ct=2415.036] That 1-2 punch, Fields to Moore.
[ct=2419.006] Washington still nary a first down begins
[ct=2424.282] this drive at the 25.
[ct=2424.671] It just feels like a game on a short week
[ct=2428.247] where one team so far has shown up
[ct=2430.945] with a chip on their shoulder, and they
[ct=2432.208] want to win a football game, and the Commanders a bit
[ct=2435.168] lethargic off to a slow start.
[ct=2437.553] They've got to find a way to regroup here and fight back
[ct=2441.568] to get back into this game.
[ct=2443.052] Sure some people thinking 0 and 4, 14 straight losses,
[ct=2446.821] it's a mess, you're a dead dog coming to town.
[ct=2449.806] It's 17 to 0.
[ct=2458.605] Toss here to the outside.
[ct=2459.933] Again, that defense does a great job.
[ct=2462.622] Robinson tackled that time by Terrell Smith,
[ct=2466.580] a rookie out of Minnesota.
[ct=2467.911] They picked him in the fifth round.
[ct=2469.340] Just to remind people that aren't familiar with it,
[ct=2470.551] the Bears are down three of their five defensive backs
[ct=2473.189] when you include the nickelback, Kyler Gordon.
[ct=2475.917] Both their corners, your corner and a safety Eddie Jackson
[ct=2479.874] So you got Terrell Smith, who just made a great play, Tyrique
[ct=2482.499] Stevenson.
[ct=2483.831] You got two rookies holding up at corner, not just
[ct=2485.167] in coverage, but also in run support right there.
[ct=2489.122] Russell Wilson able to shred them
[ct=2490.487] last week in that second half.
[ct=2491.882] Second down and 8.
[ct=2497.476] To the outside, caught, and making the tackle 2 yards shy.
[ct=2503.797] Curtis Samuel making the grab there.
[ct=2507.609] You got Stroman in on the tackle.
[ct=2511.590] They're going to spot the ball at the 33-yard line.
[ct=2515.779] Third and 2.
[ct=2516.679] That time, Sam Howell doing a better job making up his mind
[ct=2520.904] That's what Eric Bieniemy really wants
[ct=2522.313] to see from him as he's working.
[ct=2523.551] Again, just his sixth career start, young guy,
[ct=2526.084] but just wants to see him be decisive and work
[ct=2530.110] through his progressions.
[ct=2531.420] That time, ball out quickly to Samuel.
[ct=2535.412] Antonio Gibson is in the backfield.
[ct=2537.478] Flare him out.
[ct=2539.356] Howell throwing.
[ct=2541.333] Catch is made.
[ct=2543.944] Reaching down is Logan Thomas.
[ct=2549.218] Makes the grab, barely stays in bounds,
[ct=2551.932] and is able to pick up their initial first down of the game.
[ct=2555.836] Al, that's a heck of a catch on a third down
[ct=2559.534] to get that first first down.
[ct=2560.898] You know Sanborn's going to blow you up.
[ct=2562.229] That ball was going down.
[ct=2563.444] The spiral was going down.
[ct=2564.713] And at 6' 6," Logan Thomas has to get down there
[ct=2567.612] like he's feeling the ground ball to make that catch.
[ct=2571.495] Heck of an effort.
[ct=2572.679] A split finger.
[ct=2577.897] Gibson, the back.
[ct=2583.221] Got something going here, and maybe a little short
[ct=2588.180] Dotson, who made the grab at the end of regulation last week,
[ct=2590.716] Smith again in on the tackle.
[ct=2593.151] Nice gain there.
[ct=2593.175] Going to spot the ball a little short of the first down.
[ct=2596.020] Second and 1.
[ct=2597.162] And again Al, here they are with quicker decisions.
[ct=2599.857] And he's an athletic guy.
[ct=2601.142] They like to get him on the edge too.
[ct=2602.470] I thought Dotson, good job of staying in bounds.
[ct=2603.993] Came so close there to stepping out of bounds,
[ct=2607.808] but a nice quick easy read, ball is out,
[ct=2610.625] get the ball to these receivers against these young corners.
[ct=2615.675] Howell, 4 for his first 4.
[ct=2622.860] They pick up another first down on a 2-yard gain
[ct=2625.295] here by Robinson.
[ct=2628.934] They are working for every yard in the trenches.
[ct=2632.683] Just like you said, it goes to show you you just never know
[ct=2636.254] from one week to the next.
[ct=2637.609] This Bears defensive front for the most part
[ct=2640.256] has gotten pushed around in the interior with Justin Jones
[ct=2642.832] and Andrew Billings this year, but not the story tonight.
[ct=2646.860] This is a motivated defense that is flying around.
[ct=2650.437] The defense that's allowed 29 points per game
[ct=2653.025] over the last two years.
[ct=2655.524] Worst in the league.
[ct=2659.303] To the outside again they go.
[ct=2662.008] Short gain here, Terry McLaurin.
[ct=2664.171] He gets into the action, making his first grab of the night.
[ct=2666.918] And what the Bears are doing with those young corners,
[ct=2669.503] they're playing a lot of softer coverage.
[ct=2672.183] So you're going to have to take those easy throws and you're
[ct=2674.797] going to have to rely on receivers making plays
[ct=2676.891] after the catch.
[ct=2678.762] So you'll take 4 yards.
[ct=2678.805] You'll take 6 yards.
[ct=2680.017] Eventually either set up double moves
[ct=2682.667] or you set up an opportunity where
[ct=2684.009] you're going to have to go down field and win one on one.
[ct=2688.035] That's Lucas Patrick, the center.
[ct=2690.683] Oh.
[ct=2691.989] So he's going to go for some attention.
[ct=2693.264] They may move Cody Whitehair, who's played a lot of center
[ct=2696.012] in his career, to that spot.
[ct=2698.602] Play action here.
[ct=2699.976] Howell fires.
[ct=2701.277] Another first down.
[ct=2702.599] And a nice run there by Thomas to pick up about 3 or 4
[ct=2706.184] more yards after contact.
[ct=2708.603] Stroman making the tackle.
[ct=2711.596] This is what Matt Eberflus is known for, this Tampa 2 look,
[ct=2714.313] meaning two high safeties.
[ct=2715.574] The backer's going to get deep, and when you get deep,
[ct=2718.282] you're taking away those shots downfield.
[ct=2720.904] And one thing you heard this week
[ct=2722.281] from Sam Howell on our call--
[ct=2723.532] hey, what's the key in going up against this style of defense?
[ct=2726.283] Well, they're going to play soft.
[ct=2728.887] I just got to take what they give me.
[ct=2730.213] I got to be patient, take those underneath throws.
[ct=2733.011] Again, Eberflus calling the defensive signals.
[ct=2738.196] First down at the 39-yard line.
[ct=2743.475] Howell, good protection-- he's going to go to the end zone.
[ct=2748.801] Dyami Brown was there, his former North Carolina mate.
[ct=2755.446] A little too tall, a little too far.
[ct=2758.096] Now, this is what they're waiting for.
[ct=2759.451] Safety here, safety down, opens up the middle.
[ct=2763.391] Finally a chance to be able to take a shot
[ct=2766.035] downfield, and they've got it.
[ct=2767.389] And when you have it, you got to connect.
[ct=2770.032] Ball is thrown well enough for Dyami Brown, who's a college
[ct=2774.062] teammate of Sam Howell.
[ct=2775.354] They've got great chemistry.
[ct=2776.724] He puts it right in that seam.
[ct=2778.162] Just unable to bring it down.
[ct=2781.416] Howell's first incompletion.
[ct=2785.964] Robinson started one way.
[ct=2787.319] Goes the other, and that doesn't fool Andrew Billings,
[ct=2791.309] having a nice night.
[ct=2792.404] Brown has the speed to be able to hit those seams, but just
[ct=2799.257] over the fingertips there.
[ct=2803.271] He's thinking, man, we had it.
[ct=2805.869] Got to hit it.
[ct=2824.514] Blitz coming, pressure.
[ct=2827.160] Howell backpedals.
[ct=2828.240] Howell going deep.
[ct=2828.564] Into traffic, and it's incomplete.
[ct=2832.440] Dotson almost was able to make the grab.
[ct=2835.200] We got a flag down, though.
[ct=2836.623] There's a flag on the far side of the field at the 36-yard
[ct=2840.454] line, which is 3 yards--
[ct=2841.768] Offsides.
[ct=2841.970] --beyond scrimmage.
[ct=2843.121] Defense, number 90, lined up in the neutral zone.
[ct=2845.764] 5-yard penalty.
[ct=2847.087] Third down.
[ct=2848.399] So that's Dominique Robinson.
[ct=2851.081] A little bit of a killer there in the sense
[ct=2852.636] that was a third and 9.
[ct=2855.114] It's going to make it third down and 4.
[ct=2856.282] Remember, in the open, you said, how do they win?
[ct=2858.980] And we talked about they got to quit self-destructing.
[ct=2861.611] It's not just penalties.
[ct=2861.838] It's the time of these penalties.
[ct=2864.262] They're off the field here.
[ct=2865.578] Now it's fourth and 9, and now it's third and 4,
[ct=2869.552] and you give Howell another chance.
[ct=2870.973] Yep.
[ct=2872.086] They're off the field and maybe not even in field goal range,
[ct=2874.815] were it not for the penalty.
[ct=2876.155] Third down and 4.
[ct=2878.991] They had the all-out blitz going on the last one.
[ct=2881.465] What do they do here?
[ct=2885.255] Coming again.
[ct=2885.433] A flag is thrown.
[ct=2886.938] Tipped!
[ct=2887.964] And for the moment, dropped.
[ct=2889.251] Almost picked off, but it's dropped.
[ct=2891.951] Hit by Edmunds.
[ct=2893.025] You saw the flag come in at the snap.
[ct=2899.642] Illegal shift on the offense.
[ct=2901.029] Two players were moving the same time and did not reset.
[ct=2904.981] Penalty's declined.
[ct=2906.347] Fourth down.
[ct=2906.376] So that makes it fourth and 4.
[ct=2911.700] And Slye's going to come in for a long field goal attempt.
[ct=2925.199] Joey Slye-- fifth year out of Virginia Tech.
[ct=2928.835] 51-yard attempt, no wind to speak of.
[ct=2935.489] Tress Way to put it down.
[ct=2939.449] And Slye's kick is perfect.
[ct=2943.466] Eight and a half to go in the first half.
[ct=2946.773] Washington on the board, but trailing 17-3
[ct=2950.657] to the Chicago Bears.
[ct=2957.380] You took something that didn't belong to you.
[ct=2959.959] The Equalizer 3 comes home--
[ct=2962.646] --with a 94% audience score.
[ct=2965.240] Are you warning me?
[ct=2966.583] I'm preparing you.
[ct=2969.229] The Equalizer 3.
[ct=2969.450] Buy or rent now, and in theaters, rated R.
[ct=2972.199] OK, quick and easy weeknight dinner that's not chicken
[ct=2977.247] Ham-and-cheese crescent rolls are
[ct=2978.645] as easy as fill, roll, bake.
[ct=2983.036] Is there enough for seconds?
[ct=2984.316] Fill, roll, bake--
[ct=2985.701] [giggles]
[ct=2985.808] --with Pillsbury.
[ct=2988.331] (SINGING) Hey, you, can we come together?
[ct=2996.261] Hey, you can we--
[ct=3000.656] New Balance.
[ct=3000.683] We got now.
[ct=3003.263] We're seeing EVs more every day.
[ct=3007.179] Good to know there's one that can still make
[ct=3009.850] people say, you don't see that every day,
[ct=3016.439] because it's the only EV that's an F-150.
[ct=3024.410] The all-electric F-150 Lightning.
[ct=3029.741] [ozzy osbourne, "crazy train"]
[ct=3031.087] (SINGING) All aboard!
[ct=3032.621] [cackles] Ay!
[ct=3044.368] You're welcome, America.
[ct=3048.346] Let's take a look at our Thursday Spotlight,
[ct=3051.042] presented by Pepsi.
[ct=3052.323] And it's Justin Fields off to a great start,
[ct=3053.875] reading, recognizing opportunities, seeing safeties
[ct=3058.991] out of position, which we've seen a lot of here
[ct=3060.598] in this first half.
[ct=3061.631] You can see his eyes just locked in on his reads.
[ct=3064.283] And of course, he has the arm strength to make those throws.
[ct=3066.900] So this first half could not have started any better.
[ct=3069.082] Of course, last week, we saw much of the same
[ct=3071.200] in the Denver game, and they are focused
[ct=3074.905] on playing for 60 minutes.
[ct=3077.571] It was the start last week.
[ct=3077.681] Yeah, last week he completed his first 16, 17.
[ct=3081.577] I think it was a long Hail Mary at the end of the half that
[ct=3084.219] fell incomplete.
[ct=3085.556] Tonight-- 9 of 13, 156.
[ct=3088.237] And of course his main man has been
[ct=3090.828] Moore, who has caught a total of five passes
[ct=3094.805] on five targets for 137.
[ct=3109.456] Joey Slye, after booting a 51-yard field goal,
[ct=3114.736] with the touchback here.
[ct=3116.096] And we go to Kaylee.
[ct=3117.454] Al, the Bears center Lucas Patrick--
[ct=3120.083] he has left the field to be evaluated for a concussion,
[ct=3122.706] so now Cody Whitehair is going to slide over to center.
[ct=3125.585] He started every game this year at left guard,
[ct=3128.044] but he does have 60 career starts at center.
[ct=3130.696] I saw him taking a couple of practice
[ct=3133.356] snaps with Justin Fields.
[ct=3134.667] He added tape to all five fingers on his right hand,
[ct=3137.441] and now he'll get a chance to slide over and see
[ct=3141.196] how this O-line can make it work without Patrick.
[ct=3143.885] Once, he began his career out of Kansas State
[ct=3147.893] as a second-round pick.
[ct=3151.872] Fields lining up in the gun here.
[ct=3157.321] He'll keep it.
[ct=3159.824] It's a block there from Blasingame.
[ct=3163.119] Run out by Curl after a gain of 6.
[ct=3166.890] That's the beautiful thing when this offense is
[ct=3169.436] going the way it is with a lot of first-and-10 passing,
[ct=3172.091] and you've seen the run game tonight with Herbert.
[ct=3174.704] They can get back to their bread and butter, which is getting
[ct=3177.474] Justin Fields out on the edge.
[ct=3179.980] Look at the yardage you pick up on first and 10.
[ct=3181.257] It's almost like Washington gets lulled to sleep,
[ct=3185.177] worried about other aspects of the offense,
[ct=3186.510] and it frees him up to pick up some positive yards there.
[ct=3194.898] Second and 3.
[ct=3197.093] Fakes the give, fires over the middle.
[ct=3198.561] Making the grab there and getting
[ct=3199.962] into Washington territory is Cole Kmet, the 6' 6"
[ct=3205.052] 260-pounder.
[ct=3206.393] Two TDs last week, big gain here, 24 yards.
[ct=3209.121] That was a good job of DJ Moore clearing things out.
[ct=3212.958] And here's the big man right here.
[ct=3214.274] Just sits in the open space.
[ct=3216.907] Linebackers have to respect the play action.
[ct=3219.512] They sink in.
[ct=3220.900] Fields gets pressured late, but what a target.
[ct=3223.546] What a luxury to throw to Kmet at 6' 6"
[ct=3226.549] in the middle of that defense.
[ct=3229.427] He is a big-time target, and Justin Fields like his security
[ct=3233.854] blanket.
[ct=3235.643] From the 45.
[ct=3239.523] Herbert, behind blocking, gets about 3.
[ct=3246.059] Payne making the stop.
[ct=3247.430] Down to seven minutes to go in the half.
[ct=3250.014] 14-point Chicago lead.
[ct=3251.621] Al, you'll love this.
[ct=3252.759] Even when it's not working, it works somewhat.
[ct=3255.552] It's been that kind of night.
[ct=3256.715] Watch the left guard, Jenkins, pull around.
[ct=3259.331] They've been opening up holes here, but watch him.
[ct=3263.359] Stumbles out of the gate.
[ct=3263.417] They still get positive yards when the guard doesn't even
[ct=3267.347] pull around to pick up the linebacker.
[ct=3272.665] 72 rushing yards, 10 carries.
[ct=3276.650] That's 7 yards per tote.
[ct=3278.049] Second and 7.
[ct=3280.957] Fake toss.
[ct=3282.182] Fields buys time.
[ct=3284.600] Fields throwing that one incomplete.
[ct=3285.922] He had Mooney and Kmet both in the neighborhood.
[ct=3289.879] Payne, that time, converged with Allen.
[ct=3292.530] Third and 7.
[ct=3293.854] Much better job, not just by the front,
[ct=3296.577] but on the back end for this Ron Rivera and Jack Del Rio
[ct=3300.609] defense.
[ct=3301.838] They not falling for the misdirection.
[ct=3304.640] Justin Fields always a threat.
[ct=3305.849] A little fake there to Khalil Herbert on the pitch, and then
[ct=3309.822] came back the other way, but the discipline
[ct=3312.440] and this sound defense there by Washington.
[ct=3325.890] Herbert.
[ct=3327.101] Enough for the first down as they give it to him.
[ct=3329.755] Inside draw.
[ct=3332.394] Nate Davis helping to lead the way.
[ct=3339.182] And going no-huddle here.
[ct=3342.093] Fourth and inches is what they're going to call it now.
[ct=3345.839] And again, does he make it?
[ct=3347.189] They say nothing yet.
[ct=3352.451] First down now.
[ct=3353.823] Man, looked like he had the first down
[ct=3355.143] on the third-down play, but he run up
[ct=3356.440] to the line of scrimmage, spotted it a little short.
[ct=3360.424] Move the sticks.
[ct=3361.676] Everybody's going to this, especially when you
[ct=3363.017] have a quarterback like a Justin Fields,
[ct=3366.829] with the size that he has.
[ct=3368.307] How about that run on the play before, on that third down,
[ct=3372.090] with Herbert?
[ct=3373.463] Almost, again, doesn't matter.
[ct=3374.709] There's been some guys rotating in.
[ct=3376.061] They're playing with some backups.
[ct=3377.456] Boy, they are climbing up to that second level
[ct=3380.054] to get into the face of those linebackers.
[ct=3386.617] Fields to the outside.
[ct=3389.232] Nothing happening there.
[ct=3389.423] Intended for Equanimeous St. Brown.
[ct=3394.354] First target of the night.
[ct=3398.451] Well, Luke Getsy is doing, again,
[ct=3400.360] a very good job of mixing up the looks
[ct=3402.022] and creating some frustration for Washington's defense,
[ct=3405.449] keeping the tight ends, from time to time, in to help out.
[ct=3409.136] That time, they did.
[ct=3409.587] Keep an extra tight end, with Marcedes Lewis
[ct=3412.944] off to the right there to affect the pass
[ct=3414.286] rush with Montez Sweat.
[ct=3415.600] So anything they can do to just try to make it look different.
[ct=3418.508] Keep the same play calls, but the presentation very
[ct=3421.921] different in this first half.
[ct=3428.926] High snap.
[ct=3430.340] Collects it.
[ct=3431.590] Again, Herbert-- tough running.
[ct=3434.295] Close to a first.
[ct=3435.628] Khalil Herbert-- six carries, 53 yards for him.
[ct=3441.982] And you touched on it.
[ct=3443.336] Watch the right hand of Fields.
[ct=3444.686] Just a heck of an athletic play.
[ct=3445.970] Again, he's a baseball player, going back
[ct=3447.241] to his high school days.
[ct=3448.366] Comes in handy there.
[ct=3449.260] You see, Herbert had to hesitate.
[ct=3450.640] A lot of times, that disrupts the timing, and the play
[ct=3453.905] gets blown up.
[ct=3455.895] Good job by Herbert, waiting, and then there's
[ct=3458.530] that offensive line again, controlling things against one
[ct=3461.155] of the top fronts in the league.
[ct=3462.655] That's Whitehair again.
[ct=3463.864] Meanwhile, here we go again on a third and 1 with the push.
[ct=3470.511] Yep, one more time.
[ct=3478.492] It's like rugby, Australian rules football.
[ct=3482.261] I don't know what it is.
[ct=3483.525] It's a mess.
[ct=3483.569] Oh, man, yeah.
[ct=3484.896] Kmet and Herbert behind him.
[ct=3486.339] Herbert's 5' 9", 212, but 6' 6", 260?
[ct=3490.261] The quarterback's 230.
[ct=3491.782] Look at the black jerseys just flying in there,
[ct=3494.187] and there's nothing you can do.
[ct=3495.508] Nothing, except change the rule next year.
[ct=3499.515] Well, the way they've been going here, wouldn't be--
[ct=3503.473] into the backfield.
[ct=3504.853] Right now, an empty look.
[ct=3510.108] Fields under pressure, and nothing.
[ct=3515.210] Just has to keep it and eat it, and tackled
[ct=3517.871] to the line of scrimmage by Sweat and Young.
[ct=3521.833] This is what they like to do because of his run game,
[ct=3525.821] but watch how--
[ct=3527.284] going with Chase Young.
[ct=3528.599] The numbers are where they want it.
[ct=3531.173] Everybody's outside.
[ct=3531.221] But look at Chase Young, known as a pass-rusher,
[ct=3535.127] but a good job of anticipating.
[ct=3536.434] When the defensive front sees empty,
[ct=3537.810] they are alert to Justin Fields as a threat to run.
[ct=3541.762] It's up to them, with the numbers cleared out of there
[ct=3544.553] against empty.
[ct=3545.046] They've got to make plays like that.
[ct=3548.387] So four wide here.
[ct=3555.058] Caught, 19-yard line.
[ct=3556.385] Kmet-- he'll take it inside the 20.
[ct=3561.725] It'll be third down.
[ct=3564.339] A little over three minutes to go to the half,
[ct=3568.338] and this will be upcoming on this drive, the 12th play.
[ct=3575.059] Bears have run 33 plays, and Commanders just 16.
[ct=3585.628] Third and 4.
[ct=3587.147] They're 5 out of 7 on third down.
[ct=3602.830] Action is there.
[ct=3604.199] It is Darnell Mooney.
[ct=3605.515] There's contact made.
[ct=3608.201] It'll be fourth down and no laundry.
[ct=3610.835] You got St-Juste covering on the play.
[ct=3612.590] Well, Mooney tries to use the big tight end, Kmet,
[ct=3616.208] to his outside.
[ct=3617.526] Uses him as a screen.
[ct=3618.806] Just tries to run behind him to affect the coverage,
[ct=3622.800] It does the job, but the ball's thrown a little bit late,
[ct=3626.747] and it allows St-Juste to be able to catch up to him
[ct=3629.444] and affect that throw.
[ct=3632.105] Terry's shaking his-- he's just shaking his head.
[ct=3634.977] Terry, what are you shaking your head for?
[ct=3638.694] Sure looked like it was early contact, not playing the ball,
[ct=3641.482] to me.
[ct=3642.699] 36-yard attempt here by Cairo Santos is good.
[ct=3648.018] 2:24 to the half.
[ct=3652.032] Chicago extends its lead to 20 to 3.
[ct=3662.639] This is not the first all-electric car.
[ct=3665.284] That's because no BMW sees the road until it's
[ct=3667.944] reached the ultimate standard, our own,
[ct=3669.755] a standard that demands that every BMW drives and feels
[ct=3673.592] exactly like a BMW should--
[ct=3676.027] unparalleled performance and precision handling,
[ct=3678.548] made possible by electric engineering.
[ct=3681.188] But isn't that what you'd expect from the ultimate electric
[ct=3685.200] driving machine?
[ct=3685.339] Hurry in and lease the 2024 BMW iX xDriv50 for 7--
[ct=3690.517] (SINGING) Private jetting in the night sky, my man
[ct=3692.074] hand-glide by with my fried rice.
[ct=3694.524] Why?
[ct=3695.815] What could you not love about a slice
[ct=3697.119] on the side of the hot tub.
[ct=3698.463] G-R-U-B-H-U-B. Did somebody say GrubHub?
[ct=3705.124] Geico makes car insurance easy-- as easy as getting personal
[ct=3709.091] Got a new play for you, the 220 Pancake Block
[ct=3711.772] You Can't Bench 350 Super Sweep.
[ct=3713.256] But I can bench 350.
[ct=3714.633] It's just a play name.
[ct=3715.751] OK, I have a play name, then.
[ct=3717.053] It's called "double pump fake, I'm stronger than you,
[ct=3719.715] I can bench 350, and I'm a good tackle."
[ct=3722.430] That's not a play name.
[ct=3722.689] With coverage for your whole lineup in the app,
[ct=3725.157] it's easy to Geico.
[ct=3726.374] What about "red zone 120, I'm good at football,
[ct=3727.867] I'm a good football analyst, and I open
[ct=3729.735] the lane better than anybody.
[ct=3730.577] I go block, block, block, block, block, block.
[ct=3733.844] I block them here.
[ct=3734.327] I block them there."
[ct=3735.762] [ring tone music]
[ct=3736.934] Travis Kelce is a champion twice.
[ct=3739.485] Dude, my new ringtone.
[ct=3740.949] Travis, zip it.
[ct=3742.222] It's your year, big guy.
[ct=3743.662] Let's get you ready.
[ct=3744.740] With 16 grams of protein per can in Chunky Spicy Chicken Noodle,
[ct=3748.812] soup that eats like a meal.
[ct=3749.384] (SINGING) Twice!

[ct=3790.745] Binge all the action tonight only on Prime Video.
[ct=3796.195] So there's your new owner of the Washington Commanders,
[ct=3802.824] Josh Harris.
[ct=3804.073] Had a chance to meet him, and Kirk and I visited with him
[ct=3809.386] Also owns the Philadelphia 76ers.
[ct=3812.026] Owns the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League,
[ct=3815.004] so he's got hockey starting up.
[ct=3817.388] Dealing with James Harden and the 76ers,
[ct=3821.028] trying to build a new arena there,
[ct=3822.445] trying to build a new stadium here .
[ct=3825.291] We asked him if he's getting any sleep.
[ct=3827.747] Not much, but this town is ecstatic.
[ct=3837.029] I've been coming here for about 38 years, doing the NFL.
[ct=3841.022] And over the last 24, especially over the last 15,
[ct=3845.445] this was not a happy fan base, but they are thrilled.
[ct=3849.675] And Dan Snyder was here for 24 years.
[ct=3851.603] Had some early success, but not much over the course
[ct=3854.288] of a quarter century.
[ct=3855.681] And boy, they were just looking for anybody to come in.
[ct=3858.259] Only cost them was 6 billion clams.
[ct=3860.917] [laughs] Right, exactly.
[ct=3861.882] But you know what was cool is just
[ct=3863.354] to hear from the players, too, and the coaches.
[ct=3866.142] There's a real appreciation for the energy
[ct=3868.686] that he's brought in.
[ct=3869.087] And they said anything that they--
[ct=3871.300] he's like, well, how can I help?
[ct=3872.650] What do you need?
[ct=3872.924] Ron Rivera's communicated with him pretty openly,
[ct=3876.661] so you're right.
[ct=3877.188] Different energy.
[ct=3879.313] This is going to be picked off.
[ct=3880.995] Greg Stroman intercepting it on the pass right over the middle,
[ct=3887.147] and the defense goes down to celebrate
[ct=3889.803] as Howell throws the pick here, and Chicago's back in business
[ct=3894.843] Here's the matchup right here.
[ct=3896.202] But what I want you to watch is Howell works from his left,
[ct=3899.750] back to his right, and by then he's late.
[ct=3902.716] This is, again, the area that he's
[ct=3904.999] trying to work and understand, is
[ct=3906.381] the timing of his progressions.
[ct=3907.643] And as a young guy, it just takes time.
[ct=3909.086] It's examples like this of learning through this.
[ct=3911.651] Heck of a play, by the way, by the backup nickel Greg
[ct=3915.659] Stroman, who's been out most of his career
[ct=3917.663] with a lot of injuries.
[ct=3919.486] I think he had 73 snaps in the last four years
[ct=3922.037] until the injury this year to Kyler Gordon has given him
[ct=3925.655] a chance to step up.
[ct=3927.541] So he's been injured.
[ct=3928.703] He's been on practice squads--
[ct=3930.026] Washington, Buffalo, the Rams.
[ct=3931.348] Chicago now, and takes advantage of his opportunity with Gordon
[ct=3935.243] down and makes a heck of a play.
[ct=3940.498] From the 36-yard line.
[ct=3944.554] Has that knocked down.
[ct=3945.845] That time, it's Chase Young knocking it down with 2:15.
[ct=3953.749] Bears have two timeouts if they need them,
[ct=3955.177] plus a two-minute warning.
[ct=3956.348] I had a chance to see Chase on the field before the game,
[ct=3958.579] just asking him how he's feeling the last few weeks.
[ct=3961.613] Looks like he's gradually getting back to 100%
[ct=3964.609] coming off the ACL from a couple of years ago,
[ct=3967.232] and he said, watch tonight.
[ct=3968.589] He's like, this is the first time I really feel good.
[ct=3971.424] And if you've watched him, I know
[ct=3972.567] it's not a great night so far for the Commanders,
[ct=3975.227] but 99 is moving around the way you expect him to.
[ct=3980.406] [chuckles] Herbert.
[ct=3987.606] Takes a bunch to bring him down.
[ct=3992.776] Third down, 7 as we approach the two-minute warning.
[ct=3998.045] This is the two-minute warning.
[ct=3999.370] Two timeouts remaining.
[ct=4000.760] It'll be third down and 7 for Chicago when we come back.
[ct=4003.360] 20 to 3, Bears.
[ct=4013.622] [playing guitar]
[ct=4013.897] (SINGING) Tacos, tacos, tacos.
[ct=4018.079] Tacos, tacos, or some pizza, wings, or some other food
[ct=4026.228] that rhymes with pizza.
[ct=4028.908] It all goes great with football unless you
[ct=4033.021] rhymed something really weird with pizza, like fashionista.
[ct=4041.938] At Midas, our skilled techs want you
[ct=4044.663] to be confident on the road, and confident

[ct=4084.839] Hot Dog Man.
[ct=4086.522] [screaming]

[ct=4091.808] Let's run that back, JJ.
[ct=4093.092] [distorted screaming]

[ct=4101.975] Official TV partner of the NFL brings game-day greatness
[ct=4105.439] into your living room on the biggest
[ct=4107.303] screens in the industry.
[ct=4108.662] This game-day greatness big-screen moment
[ct=4111.326] features the Bills, whose Week 4 victory was highlighted
[ct=4115.262] in part by Stefon Diggs.
[ct=4115.506] Diggs caught a pass from quarterback Josh Allen,
[ct=4117.815] evaded tackles from Dolphins defenders Kader Kohou
[ct=4120.613] and Brandon Jones, and sprinted to the end zone,
[ct=4122.785] increasing the Bills' lead en route to a 48-to-20 victory.
[ct=4128.208] TCL.
[ct=4128.586] Inspire greatness.
[ct=4133.061] There they are, with apologies to the Michigan basketball
[ct=4136.827] team, the Fab Five.
[ct=4139.455] Charissa has rounded up the troops.
[ct=4142.826] Can't wait to hear these guys weigh in.
[ct=4145.840] On a night when you thought, Chicago's
[ct=4146.989] coming in, are they dead, or whatever, it's all Chicago,
[ct=4151.740] 20 to 3.
[ct=4153.009] State Farm halftime show coming up in a couple of minutes,
[ct=4158.069] plus.
[ct=4160.474] From the 33-yard line on third down and 7,
[ct=4162.901] Herbert fights his way inside the 25.
[ct=4166.868] Look at this.
[ct=4168.968] Cody Whitehair leading the way.
[ct=4172.187] So Moore's having a fabulous night.
[ct=4173.493] Meanwhile, here's Herbert-- eight carries, 72 yards.
[ct=4177.518] That's 9 yards a carry.
[ct=4178.835] But watch Whitehair and also the right guard, Nate Davis.
[ct=4182.878] Both of them able to climb up to that second level.
[ct=4186.031] No interior defensive lineman.
[ct=4187.566] Made it very easy for that interior
[ct=4190.082] to be able to get up and impact, again, those linebackers.
[ct=4194.081] There's just no one there.
[ct=4199.203] From the 17.
[ct=4209.354] Herbert again, behind Blasingame.
[ct=4212.072] To the outside he goes.
[ct=4214.520] And every run's a tough run for him.
[ct=4215.954] Khalil Herbert-- third year out of Virginia Tech,
[ct=4219.792] a sixth-round pick in '21.
[ct=4222.735] He's averaging almost 9 yards a carry tonight.
[ct=4224.914] And if the Bears get this going with the way they
[ct=4228.503] like their structure of their offense,
[ct=4230.088] with Fields as a threat off play action
[ct=4231.596] and him being able to run on the outside, it's a game-changer.
[ct=4236.563] It's what Luke Getsy--
[ct=4237.773] anybody wants the run game, but especially
[ct=4240.208] this system and their quarterback.
[ct=4245.589] He's now in Detroit.
[ct=4246.927] Saw him last week.
[ct=4249.272] And Herbert's now the man.
[ct=4251.884] Go five wide here.
[ct=4252.884] Fields hanging in, rolling away.
[ct=4255.364] Fields, looking for the first down,
[ct=4256.684] gets it and slides to a stop inside the 5.
[ct=4260.632] The official, for the moment, looked
[ct=4260.908] like he was going to reach for the flag, but did not.
[ct=4265.362] That's Darrick Forrest right there.
[ct=4268.634] Lose the edge, man-to-man coverage on the back end,
[ct=4273.962] and against an athletic quarterback.
[ct=4276.598] If you lose the edge with Chase Young,
[ct=4277.954] there's no one left there to account
[ct=4280.585] for the most dangerous weapon the Bears have,
[ct=4283.288] and that's Justin Fields.
[ct=4284.575] I think the official, so far, is trying to get out of the way,
[ct=4287.358] if nothing else.
[ct=4288.414] First down and goal.
[ct=4292.541] Fields again, over the middle.
[ct=4294.150] Caught, Kmet!
[ct=4295.181] Touchdown.
[ct=4301.853] Cole Kmet.
[ct=4303.235] Third in two weeks, and the Commanders fans are going,
[ct=4308.458] what is going on?
[ct=4311.339] I think they are frustrated.
[ct=4313.391] And I think the Bears came into this game pretty confident
[ct=4317.813] that they could attack the backers in coverage.
[ct=4321.286] And here's the big tight end right
[ct=4323.090] here, going up against the middle linebacker, Cody Barton.
[ct=4325.993] It's a mismatch.
[ct=4327.099] He gets separation.
[ct=4328.471] Even if he doesn't get separation,
[ct=4329.881] it's an advantage, at 6' 6".
[ct=4332.446] But he shows you.
[ct=4333.747] He flexed him out.
[ct=4335.026] He is a threat out there on the perimeter.
[ct=4339.031] Santos, extra point.
[ct=4341.747] And if you're just tuning in, that is not a typo.
[ct=4345.812] 27 to 3, Bears.
[ct=4354.965] People are excited about what AI will do for them.
[ct=4358.837] We're excited about what AI will do for business.
[ct=4360.808] Introducing watsonx, a platform designed to multiply output
[ct=4365.553] by training AI with your data.
[ct=4368.185] When you watsonx your business, you
[ct=4369.476] can build AI to help coders code faster,
[ct=4372.158] customer service respond quicker,
[ct=4374.815] and employees handle repetitive tasks in less time.
[ct=4377.444] Let's create AI that transforms business with watsonx.
[ct=4384.564] Hi, mom.
[ct=4385.414] Kelly, Rita, and I just went on our Carnival Cruise.
[ct=4388.056] Hey, look, that's me there in the middle.
[ct=4390.749] And we just really found ourselves, you know?
[ct=4393.436] I got over my fear of bubbles.
[ct=4395.743] Rita took some time to reflect.
[ct=4398.027] We tried new things and new foods.
[ct=4399.701] Kelly's thinking about getting piano lessons.
[ct=4403.713] And I'm getting really good at golf.
[ct=4407.716] Anyways, next year we should all go together.
[ct=4411.697] [foghorn fanfare]
[ct=4413.014] Choose fun!
[ct=4415.311] [coughs]
[ct=4415.639] Honey.
[ct=4418.561] NyQuil Severe Honey, powerful cold and flu relief
[ct=4421.829] with a dreamy honey taste.
[ct=4423.071] NyQuil Honey, the nighttime, sniffling, sneezing, coughing,
[ct=4426.172] aching, fever, honeylicious, "best
[ct=4428.371] sleep with a cold" medicine.
[ct=4429.460] The Three for Me, only at Chili's, serves up
[ct=4432.144] bottomless drinks, bottomless chips and salsa,
[ct=4434.768] and a cheeseburger and fries for just $10.99.
[ct=4437.403] Hey, it's three for me, not three for us.
[ct=4440.083] This Chili's Three for Me is the--
[ct=4448.911] You look at Matt Eberflus.
[ct=4449.429] Here's a guy-- his team hasn't won a game in almost a year.
[ct=4452.458] They beat New England Week 7 last year.
[ct=4455.971] 3 and 18 is his record over a year and a quarter.
[ct=4461.426] He's been getting killed, obviously, in the press,
[ct=4464.843] in the media, and all that stuff,
[ct=4466.237] and obviously by social media as well, as usual.
[ct=4471.538] And there's even some stories out today about
[ct=4473.339] will he get fired after the game, with 10 days
[ct=4477.138] till the next game?
[ct=4478.773] Well, there's a lot of release of emotion right now.
[ct=4481.373] It's almost been a year since they won a football game.
[ct=4484.137] Of course, they had a big lead at half.
[ct=4485.399] That'll be, I'm sure, his speech at halftime.
[ct=4488.083] They were up big on Denver and ended up losing.
[ct=4489.292] But it just looks like a team that's
[ct=4491.919] ticked off and tired of it, you know what I mean?
[ct=4493.860] They're playing with a lot of emotion tonight.
[ct=4495.781] I'll tell you, the seat doesn't get any hotter
[ct=4498.338] than what he and Justin Fields are dealing with in Chicago,
[ct=4502.152] having lost 14 straight, and they're
[ct=4504.806] trying to put in, staying positive,
[ct=4506.311] and they're trying to get through the storm,
[ct=4508.645] saying the right thing.
[ct=4509.987] But you know it's eating them up,
[ct=4511.345] and this first half's been great for them.
[ct=4513.767] No doubt.
[ct=4514.105] The numbers are astonishing--
[ct=4515.146] 307 yards for Chicago, 49 for Washington.
[ct=4520.391] That is a 6-to-1 ratio.
[ct=4524.296] And he has to throw that away.
[ct=4524.430] And that Bear defense, which has obviously had a meltdown
[ct=4529.574] in the second half-- and this is a team that gives up,
[ct=4532.272] as I mentioned, 29 points per game,
[ct=4533.551] the worst in the league over the last two years--
[ct=4536.261] allowing 49 yards on 18 plays.
[ct=4541.409] It's unbelievable.
[ct=4542.757] The biggest Bears fan couldn't have expected this.
[ct=4545.439] This defense has not been able to win the line of scrimmage
[ct=4549.316] They've not been able to apply pressure.
[ct=4551.914] You just saw Gervon Dexter come in, 99, as a rookie.
[ct=4555.801] He gets pressure.
[ct=4556.144] Stroman had that interception.
[ct=4557.719] He started his career here.
[ct=4559.818] And that pass is caught, but nothing really happening
[ct=4563.796] after that.
[ct=4564.897] Even that time, rushing four, DeMarcus Walker-- he
[ct=4567.706] gets home and affects the quarterback.
[ct=4571.649] It's almost like they're putting it all into this first half.
[ct=4575.653] Shows you the potential of what this defense can
[ct=4578.276] do despite being down Eddie Jackson,
[ct=4580.951] Juwan Johnson, Kyler Gordon.
[ct=4583.583] You're missing three guys in the back end,
[ct=4584.967] but they have shown up with something to prove tonight.
[ct=4598.186] It'll be caught here.
[ct=4600.925] At least Antonio Gibson gets the first down.
[ct=4606.257] Meanwhile--
[ct=4607.514] First charged timeout.
[ct=4608.836] --one, they're going to take a timeout.
[ct=4612.819] [scattered booing]
[ct=4614.135] Even the crowd doesn't like the timeout.
[ct=4617.411] They're going, really?
[ct=4618.132] You're going to go 64 yards here in three seconds?
[ct=4622.118] Who knows?
[ct=4623.492] Maybe you get a pass-interference penalty,
[ct=4624.777] setting up deep.
[ct=4631.191] Ron Rivera hasn't had too many games like this in his career.
[ct=4638.207] This is a skunky to this point.
[ct=4642.171] 14 first downs to 4.
[ct=4644.788] Eberflus says, get all the way back there.
[ct=4646.361] Get all the way back.
[ct=4647.530] All the way.
[ct=4647.754] 40, 50 yards back.
[ct=4650.141] Get back over there in Bethesda.
[ct=4654.719] Final play of the half, barring a defensive foul.
[ct=4662.172] That'll pick up some meaningless yardage.
[ct=4665.244] [booing]
[ct=4666.305] And the crowd says it all.
[ct=4676.846] 27 to 3.
[ct=4682.128] Down to you, Kaylee.
[ct=4682.349] Coach, it seems like everything is working for your offense.
[ct=4687.088] Really working hard on detail, and that's been coming.
[ct=4689.878] We saw it last week, a glimpse of that last week,
[ct=4692.515] and we're seeing it tonight.
[ct=4693.476] And we just got to finish the game the right way.
[ct=4697.461] You know no lead is safe.
[ct=4699.016] What will you tell your team at the half?
[ct=4700.579] Yeah, it's 0-0 to us.
[ct=4702.161] I know that's coach talk, but that's
[ct=4704.592] what we're going to tell them.
[ct=4705.506] And we got to focus, and we got to finish.
[ct=4708.378] All right, thanks.
[ct=4710.783] Pretty much an astonishing first half.
[ct=4717.633] State Farm halftime show coming up after the break.
[ct=4725.285] We are at war.
[ct=4727.977] Captain Marvel, we need you to save the world.
[ct=4737.119] They took everything from me.
[ct=4739.710] So want to fight?
[ct=4745.977] You cannot protect your people.
[ct=4749.302] Watch me.
[ct=4750.913] The Marvels, rated PG-13, in theaters November 10.
[ct=4753.186] Tickets on sale Tuesday.
[ct=4754.918] Cam!
[ct=4755.119] How'd you spend the offseason?
[ct=4757.192] Hmm.
[ct=4759.896] Picnic!
[ct=4759.983] Sleepover!
[ct=4761.206] Movie night!
[ct=4762.530] Best offseason ever!
[ct=4765.195] Just hit the weights.
[ct=4766.385] Try the new 4-Quarter Calzony.
[ct=4767.631] It's officially delicious.
[ct=4769.010] Pizza pizza.
[ct=4769.325] One down, nine to go.
[ct=4771.147] Hey, what are you doing out here?
[ct=4772.520] I just had something picked up.
[ct=4773.609] Oh my gosh, I'm having something delivered.
[ct=4776.473] You know Carvana?
[ct=4776.543] Bought it, scheduled it, [gasps] and here it is!
[ct=4779.136] You think Carvana's is good for buying?
[ct=4781.824] You should try selling one.
[ct=4782.553] Buy--
[ct=4782.752] Or sell.
[ct=4783.144] --your car.
[ct=4784.457] [vocalizing]
[ct=4787.158] (SINGING) Zoom in close, and I might strike a pose.
[ct=4788.489] I'm in my zone, but I'm sure that you know.
[ct=4791.024] Too much drip.
[ct=4792.366] It ain't my fault.
[ct=4793.607] [wind]
[ct=4793.868] (SINGING) It's in my wall.
[ct=4794.995] Run it like it feel great.
[ct=4796.368] Hit them with a freeze frame.
[ct=4797.361] I've been thinking about it.
[ct=4800.317] Will marry me?
[ct=4801.682] [screams]
[ct=4802.935] (SINGING) Zoom, zoom, zoom.
[ct=4805.850] Zoom in on me.
[ct=4806.949] Zoom, zoom, zoom.
[ct=4809.371] That girl can't get me.
[ct=4810.935] Room, room, room.
[ct=4813.308] I become one with the camera, focused.
[ct=4814.894] Snapshot costs like a million, golden.
[ct=4817.531] Flex so you know all my angles, easy.
[ct=4820.267] Make sure they can see me.
[ct=4822.891] [gasps] Wow.
[ct=4824.204] (SINGING) Zoom, zoom--
[ct=4825.541] Wee!
[ct=4826.830] (SINGING) Zoom in on me.
[ct=4830.803] Back up and give me.
[ct=4832.192] Oh!
[ct=4833.192] [excited laughter]
[ct=4834.893] [music continues]
[ct=4845.376] Sunday Morning Football is back on NFL Network with
[ct=4849.029] the must-see showdown from across the pond--
[ct=4851.930] Let's go!
[ct=4853.295] --as Trevor Lawrence and the Jags--
[ct=4854.638] Making people miss.
[ct=4855.937] --take on Josh Allen and the Bills--
[ct=4857.167] End zone, touchdown!
[ct=4858.550] --live from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London.
[ct=4861.129] It's a special moment.
[ct=4862.190] Rise.
[ct=4862.479] He's got it!
[ct=4863.828] What a tie!
[ct=4865.157] And watch a full day of football.
[ct=4867.031] (SINGING) Hail the king.
[ct=4870.314] I'm here!
[ct=4870.424] Sunday at 9:30 on NFL Network and NFL Plus.
[ct=4881.830] Welcome to the State Farm halftime show, and what
[ct=4884.817] a first 30 minutes from Chicago.
[ct=4887.532] They did not look like the team that
[ct=4888.819] has lost 14 straight games, as they lead the Commanders
[ct=4891.764] at the half, 27 to 3.
[ct=4894.530] Welcome in, everyone.
[ct=4895.469] I'm Charissa Thompson, alongside Tony Gonzalez,
[ct=4896.781] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Andrew Whitworth, and Richard Sherman.
[ct=4900.779] This offense is clicking on all cylinders.
[ct=4903.650] DJ Moore-- a big first half.
[ct=4904.745] What do you like so far out of the Bears?
[ct=4906.363] DJ Moore is absolutely having himself a game.
[ct=4908.723] AJ Brown, last week against this defense,
[ct=4910.401] had 175 yards, two touchdowns.
[ct=4912.706] DJ Moore said, I saw something on film,
[ct=4915.446] and I can do that, too.
[ct=4916.680] And it starts in three phases.
[ct=4917.006] First phase, right here, he gets the ball in his hands.
[ct=4919.357] Run after catch.
[ct=4920.606] Got to have this, as a receiver.
[ct=4921.700] You look at him get up the sideline
[ct=4923.274] right here with some nice, nifty moves,
[ct=4924.689] and they finally push him out of bounds.
[ct=4926.042] Then, here, it's savviness, finding that spot in the zone.
[ct=4930.082] See, he doesn't run full speed.
[ct=4931.367] Slow-choke it, and sit there, and score that touchdown.
[ct=4935.184] Then, right here, it's a double move.
[ct=4936.659] Uh-oh, bite on it, and then a great throw by Justin Fields.
[ct=4939.168] Justin Fields is playing some outstanding football.
[ct=4941.389] This whole Bears team-- they've got more energy.
[ct=4944.514] They look like a really solid football team right now.
[ct=4947.168] They heard Whit's pregame speech.
[ct=4948.519] That's it, baby.
[ct=4949.519] Must have.
[ct=4949.590] They really do, and Justin Fields looks comfortable.
[ct=4953.237] And what I said before the game-- in his footwork,
[ct=4954.920] you can tell the certainty that he has in his mind.
[ct=4957.729] So we're not seeing those lazy "hop back there" drops.
[ct=4961.090] This one right here was great because it just slows down
[ct=4964.245] that pass rush.
[ct=4965.324] Here we go, whipping it like a shortstop.
[ct=4968.245] And then, right here, that's certainty.
[ct=4969.567] That's having your feet in the ground,
[ct=4970.880] and he's delivering the football with a purpose.
[ct=4973.521] It's been really impressive to see.
[ct=4975.171] We really started to see it last week.
[ct=4980.064] The way that they've worked together,
[ct=4982.724] some of the things that Justin Fields said--
[ct=4984.091] this is really important for him to come out and play well
[ct=4986.743] for his coach, and he's doing it right now.
[ct=4988.014] We talked about it in the pregame.
[ct=4989.369] Washington's defense has given up
[ct=4990.710] at least 33 points in each of the last three games
[ct=4993.885] they played.
[ct=4994.677] That trend continued here.
[ct=4995.973] So Sherm, take us through the Highlight Bundle,
[ct=4997.312] presented by State Farm, and what they're not doing well.
[ct=4999.964] I'm sure Jack Del Rio is incensed
[ct=5001.963] right now because his secondary is just not
[ct=5004.188] playing good enough.
[ct=5005.286] You see, right here, this is one-on-one coverage,
[ct=5006.853] man-to-man.
[ct=5007.952] He takes the inside release, then he gets up the field.
[ct=5010.625] This is their number one receiver.
[ct=5011.951] You should have eyes on him at all times.
[ct=5013.432] But you can deal with that.
[ct=5014.807] But this you cannot deal with.
[ct=5015.915] Cover-2 safety with his back turned to the number one
[ct=5018.929] receiver, wide open.
[ct=5021.225] No help, no cover to the defense--
[ct=5022.741] that's unacceptable football.
[ct=5024.168] Here, another man-to-man stand-up route.
[ct=5027.687] Kendall Fuller decided to play the front pylon.
[ct=5029.814] They threw it to the back pylon.
[ct=5030.290] That's a mistake you can't make as a veteran corner.
[ct=5033.224] It started to frustrate me.
[ct=5034.788] I started stretching a little bit,
[ct=5035.899] because if they're playing this bad,
[ct=5037.460] I'm going to go out there in tennis shoes
[ct=5039.626] and get the job done if they're going to play like this.
[ct=5041.193] Come on, give me a few dollars.
[ct=5043.614] Well, I'm going to tell you, Ron Rivera at halftime, I'm sure,
[ct=5044.973] is reminding his team that this is a Chicago Bears
[ct=5047.570] team that gave up a 21-point lead last week to the Broncos.
[ct=5051.567] So if you're the Commanders, how do you
[ct=5052.927] get back in this thing, Whit?
[ct=5053.285] Well, I think you look at what the Broncos were able to do.
[ct=5055.572] They finally started getting the football down the field
[ct=5058.192] in the second half.
[ct=5059.558] Had some big explosive plays, and you
[ct=5060.882] got to slow this Bears offense down.
[ct=5062.189] But Justin Fields and them looked hot.
[ct=5063.544] I think, really, you look on that side of the football.
[ct=5065.476] Can Justin Fields and the Bears offense continue to run it?
[ct=5069.182] Because with a lead in these kind of games,
[ct=5071.200] you got to be able to convert, move the chains,
[ct=5073.529] and keep that clock moving, and get your own plays when
[ct=5076.216] they present themselves.
[ct=5077.487] Right, but the complaint last week with the Bears
[ct=5078.898] was they got too conservative.
[ct=5080.163] They took the ball out of Justin Fields' hands.
[ct=5082.997] So keep your foot on the gas, and keep
[ct=5084.460] going if you're Luke Getsy and Justin Fields.
[ct=5086.949] And you heard him say that to Kaylee at halftime.
[ct=5088.266] Sympathy is pouring in from around the football world
[ct=5092.275] and the NFL community as we remember the life and legacy
[ct=5096.252] of Pro Football Hall of Famer and Chicago Bear legend Dick
[ct=5099.994] Butkus, who passed away at the age of 80.
[ct=5113.305] some said, keep dreaming.
[ct=5119.918] Now we're working on an EV that has wings,
[ct=5123.901] and someday we'll turn your old Honda
[ct=5125.502] into your brand-new Honda, because we
[ct=5129.506] are a company of dreamers setting out
[ct=5131.898] to be carbon-neutral by 2050.
[ct=5141.093] Uh, I don't know, Jake from State Farm.
[ct=5143.797] But just imagine, Mahomes and MaAuto.
[ct=5146.725] Best bundle in the league, baby.
[ct=5148.004] Man, why can't Patrick change his name?
[ct=5150.497] It could be Kelce and "Kelce how much you can save
[ct=5153.280] by bundling home and auto."
[ct=5158.409] You make the letters smaller.
[ct=5163.727] Put your jersey on.
[ct=5165.071] Come on!
[ct=5165.357] --just another way to save with the Personal Price Plan.
[ct=5173.900] Next week, we're heading to Kansas City for Broncos-Chiefs.
[ct=5177.147] We don't know if Taylor Swift will be there,
[ct=5179.727] but we do TNF in the Shop will be part of the action.
[ct=5182.430] Here are LeBron, Mav, and Paul Rivera to tell you
[ct=5186.142] what to expect.
[ct=5187.729] We're back!
[ct=5189.642] Crew is back.
[ct=5190.335] Thursday Night Football in the Shop.
[ct=5193.055] [laughter, applause]
[ct=5195.715] Shout-out to Al Michaels, Kirk Herbstreit, and Amazon Prime
[ct=5199.699] for having us back.
[ct=5199.936] Thank you.
[ct=5200.842] October 12, we'll see you--
[ct=5202.323] KC and the Broncos.
[ct=5203.645] Oh, man, I can't wait for that.
[ct=5205.017] Anytime you say KC, the first thing you think about
[ct=5207.641] is Pat Mahomes, of course.
[ct=5209.013] You add Travis Kelce.
[ct=5210.297] You add the big guy calling the shots,
[ct=5211.628] and it's an Arrowhead, too, one of the craziest environments
[ct=5215.595] So what we got from the Broncos, though?
[ct=5216.954] You've got to find out if Russ and Sean are going to work out.
[ct=5219.522] We're going to talk about in the shop.
[ct=5221.202] You never know who's going to stop by.
[ct=5223.520] By the way, Travis, you still owe us an appearance.
[ct=5226.128] We talked about this.
[ct=5227.469] We'll see you on a bye week or the offseason
[ct=5228.790] after you win another Super Bowl.
[ct=5230.103] But in the meantime, we will see you October 12
[ct=5232.858] on Amazon Prime in the shop.
[ct=5235.425] Yes, sir.
[ct=5238.501] I tell you what, I'm glad we get the Shop back, huh?
[ct=5241.986] We got Magic Johnson.
[ct=5243.367] Oh, man, this is great.
[ct=5244.604] But I can't wait to get back out to Kansas City,
[ct=5247.072] see how they keep evolving as a team.
[ct=5248.394] I do not think they've played their best football yet.
[ct=5251.045] Going against the Broncos, going to be a great game.
[ct=5252.713] Russell Wilson played pretty well last week,
[ct=5254.899] got his first win.
[ct=5256.289] Yeah, Kansas City has won 15 straight against the Broncos.
[ct=5258.892] Meanwhile, the Chicago Bears looking to get their first
[ct=5263.051] win in almost a year.
[ct=5264.212] And who's happy about this halftime score?
[ct=5266.879] Lil Durk.
[ct=5268.238] Coming up after TNF Nightcap, we'll
[ct=5269.493] be taking the stage in Los Angeles
[ct=5271.698] and performing tracks from his current smash album, Almost
[ct=5275.464] Amazon Music Live, when the game ends and the music begins.
[ct=5279.852] And there were plenty of questions for the Bears
[ct=5281.317] after Sunday's loss, and they've answered them so far
[ct=5285.014] on both sides of the ball.
[ct=5285.342] Chicago leading this one 27 to 3 at the half.
[ct=5288.971] This has been the State Farm halftime show.
[ct=5291.537] The second half is next.
[ct=5292.617] We will see you postgame.
[ct=5305.397] You think life is short?
[ct=5306.619] Football is short.
[ct=5307.679] The regular season's just 18 weeks, just three days a week,
[ct=5311.591] sometimes just one game a day.

[ct=5402.703] The Chicago Bears-- everything working perfectly
[ct=5407.854] in the first half.
[ct=5409.241] You have Justin Fields, big half.
[ct=5411.703] Threw for 189 yards, three touchdowns.
[ct=5414.425] 27 to 3 is our score.
[ct=5418.284] Again, a tremendous first half for Chicago.
[ct=5423.322] He's done it now in consecutive games.
[ct=5424.624] Did it against Denver last week in the first half
[ct=5428.424] with three TD passes.
[ct=5432.378] They've been tough on the ground and in the air, and of course,
[ct=5434.702] a tremendous start tonight.
[ct=5437.198] DJ Moore, 124--
[ct=5439.375] 125 receiving yards for the TD in three consecutive games.
[ct=5444.385] 307 total yards in the first half.
[ct=5446.937] So I mean, every number, you can look anywhere you want.
[ct=5450.522] 14 to 5 in first downs.
[ct=5451.791] 307 to 84 in yardage, and some of that 84 came at the end
[ct=5456.669] and didn't mean anything in the first half.
[ct=5459.173] Yeah, pretty much every stat you can look at
[ct=5460.559] is different from what we expected when we drove up
[ct=5464.443] to the stadium today.
[ct=5464.770] I mean, everything is contrary to what most people expected
[ct=5468.914] to see in this first half, but if you're Matt Eberflus,
[ct=5472.366] it's pretty easy to rallying call.
[ct=5474.959] Just remember last week, 21 to 7 at half.
[ct=5476.998] Got it all the way up to 28 to 7 on Denver
[ct=5480.090] and ended up losing the game.
[ct=5481.347] Right, 31-28.
[ct=5484.034] All right, we start with the touchback here.
[ct=5485.340] Washington at the 25 yard line, but first, to Kaylee.
[ct=5490.665] Coach, how do you contain the Bears offense?
[ct=5493.320] Well, we got 30 minutes.
[ct=5494.664] We'll find out.
[ct=5494.804] We got to find that [muted] out on the field.
[ct=5497.348] It's got to be the guys that go out
[ct=5498.668] and step up and play some football.
[ct=5499.942] What did you say to try to rally your guys during the half?
[ct=5504.976] My guys have got to do to the guys are going to go out
[ct=5507.634] on the field, so those--
[ct=5508.967] they talked about.
[ct=5509.255] And what did they say.
[ct=5510.257] They talked about doing it for each other
[ct=5512.927] more so than anything else.
[ct=5513.289] Thank you, coach.
[ct=5515.518] Direct.
[ct=5516.834] For sure.
[ct=5520.788] To the 25.
[ct=5522.095] Pass, Robinson makes the grab.
[ct=5523.688] Robinson is able to slide away from contact,
[ct=5528.723] and it's a good beginning for Washington
[ct=5530.125] to start the third quarter as he takes it
[ct=5532.628] to midfield, gain of 24 yards.
[ct=5536.710] Screens have hurt this defense all year long,
[ct=5539.348] and the timing of this is pretty good by Sam Howell.
[ct=5541.831] He looks left, kind of shows he's
[ct=5543.832] going to go to the man in motion, then comes back.
[ct=5545.975] Gets rid of it just in time and picks up some good blocks
[ct=5550.338] downfield.
[ct=5551.576] I'm surprised they're not going a little faster
[ct=5553.401] with a little bit of tempo just because Sam Howell looked
[ct=5556.914] so good last week against Philly late in that game in that
[ct=5559.841] two minute drill when he's playing with a little bit
[ct=5563.530] more urgency.
[ct=5569.183] Play-action.
[ct=5571.338] Good protection.
[ct=5572.555] That's caught.
[ct=5575.008] Gain of about six, Brian Robinson making the grab again.
[ct=5580.170] Call it a seven yard pickup, second down
[ct=5582.789] and 3 for the Commanders.
[ct=5584.506] Now, you go back to the beginning
[ct=5585.451] of this game, the plan that Ron Rivera and his staff
[ct=5589.311] came up with, with Eric Bieniemy,
[ct=5589.737] was being patient, knowing that the Bears are going to sit back
[ct=5594.584] without those three defensive backs,
[ct=5595.861] their starters in the game.
[ct=5597.084] They thought they'd get a lot of zone,
[ct=5598.362] and it's just taking their time and being patient.
[ct=5602.351] Much tougher to do down 24 in the second half.
[ct=5606.357] That pass is caught for a first down,
[ct=5609.063] and then shoved out of bounds.
[ct=5611.671] That's Logan Thomas shoved out by Stevenson, so another first
[ct=5615.671] down for Washington.
[ct=5617.034] Right away, Eric Bieniemy attacking the softer coverage.
[ct=5619.670] If you're going to get easy throws to pick up first downs,
[ct=5623.627] you take it.
[ct=5623.655] This second half could come down to their ability
[ct=5627.684] You're going to move the ball between the 20s.
[ct=5630.248] What are you going to do when you get down in the red zone,
[ct=5632.792] and those windows get tighter?
[ct=5635.204] They got great length at linebacker
[ct=5636.423] with Tremaine Edmunds and DJ Edwards.
[ct=5638.989] That red zone's has been foreign territory for these guys
[ct=5642.923] to this point.
[ct=5644.255] From the 39 on first down.
[ct=5648.708] Getting round here to Gibson, and they picked up
[ct=5653.336] three first downs on the first four plays
[ct=5655.896] of the third quarter.
[ct=5657.205] Remember we talked about what Chicago's doing?
[ct=5659.780] They don't want to give up that easy, easy score.
[ct=5661.093] They don't want to give up anything downfield,
[ct=5663.736] so they're just sinking in coverage.
[ct=5666.373] And Howell knows that, and Eric Bieniemy talked to him
[ct=5669.099] about that at halftime.
[ct=5670.383] And you get the ball out to an athlete
[ct=5671.755] like Gibson, who's a former receiver in college,
[ct=5674.365] and has done it up at this level.
[ct=5677.043] Pick up again, positive yards.
[ct=5677.258] I'm telling you, it's going to come down to that red zone.
[ct=5681.019] You're going to move the ball.
[ct=5683.572] Picked up 48 yards on the first four plays on this drive.
[ct=5690.210] From the 27 now, blitz coming from the outside.
[ct=5694.174] Picked it up initially, has time,
[ct=5696.771] throws, contact, flag, pass incomplete,
[ct=5700.602] but you got Stevenson covering McLaurin,
[ct=5704.603] who's been silent tonight.
[ct=5705.423] McLaurin only one target one catch coming in three yards.
[ct=5710.105] Going to call it against Chicago.
[ct=5712.557] On the defense, number 29.
[ct=5713.894] That's a spot foul, an automatic first down.
[ct=5717.880] Well, it's a great matchup.
[ct=5719.172] The reason McLaurin's had a quiet night
[ct=5720.557] is, again, going back to the plan, you got a rookie corner.
[ct=5723.013] He's not crazy.
[ct=5724.326] You're going up against a really talented receiver.
[ct=5725.637] You're giving him space.
[ct=5726.826] That out and up doesn't fool him.
[ct=5728.185] He's going to give up anything except something downfield,
[ct=5731.037] but he ends up getting caught with hands--
[ct=5733.466] Number 78 of the offense is reporting his own--
[ct=5736.163] The ball down inside the 2 yard line.
[ct=5737.447] 25 yard penalty on a pass that might not
[ct=5742.790] have been catchable to begin with going that far out
[ct=5748.111] Logan Thomas lined up in the backfield.
[ct=5750.748] Now, he goes out on the wing to the right.
[ct=5753.426] Robinson is the back.
[ct=5756.038] Fake to him, and Howell on the run.
[ct=5758.738] Howell throws to the end zone.
[ct=5760.500] It's caught.
[ct=5762.761] Thomas, touchdown Washington.
[ct=5765.379] Man, they must have had a pretty good talking to each other
[ct=5768.534] in that locker room.
[ct=5770.467] That's the way you want to start the second half.
[ct=5773.032] Actually, Elijah Hicks plays this pretty well off the ball.
[ct=5780.965] They're going to go for two.
[ct=5783.826] 27-9.
[ct=5784.961] For what it's worth, it would make it
[ct=5786.253] a two possession lead, if they get it, to make it 27 to 11.
[ct=5790.224] So going for the deuce here.
[ct=5791.774] See, Hicks initially had him covered off the line.
[ct=5795.587] He was almost expecting that play action pass.
[ct=5797.148] But then just got his eyes on a quarterback
[ct=5799.760] and lost a big tight end there in coverage.
[ct=5804.676] And that secondary minus Eddie Jackson,
[ct=5808.496] who would be their top guy, going for a pair here.
[ct=5814.090] Howell again rolling, looking, going
[ct=5817.848] to keep it himself and get in there.
[ct=5820.506] Two-point conversion is good, so the crowd comes to life.
[ct=5825.804] The Commanders come to life.
[ct=5828.441] That took three minutes to go 75 yards.
[ct=5831.191] Five plays to make it 27 to 11.
[ct=5847.008] Please, please, please, please, please.
[ct=5851.186] The all new Hyundai Kona--
[ct=5858.991] You look into a camera, and you say I hate, yada yada,
[ct=5862.993] and I love that this company doesn't have any of that.
[ct=5866.983] Do you two know what yada yada is?
[ct=5869.505] Of course.
[ct=5869.760] Do you have an activation fee?
[ct=5870.929] Only when you activate.
[ct=5872.288] How many people do I need to get the best price?
[ct=5874.925] You shouldn't yada yada that because details matter.
[ct=5877.562] Yada yada, I'm already in an ad for Visible.
[ct=5880.639] Visible has no activation fees, no need for a family plan.

[ct=5937.133] From the diabolical world of the Boys, Gen V,
[ct=5940.587] new series set at a prestigious college for superheroes.
[ct=5946.907] New episode tonight only on Prime Video.
[ct=5950.906] Prestigious college, Columbus, Ohio?
[ct=5953.446] Could be.
[ct=5953.763] Yeah, Tempe?
[ct=5956.160] Yes, could be.
[ct=5959.005] Oh, beautiful.
[ct=5960.106] Meanwhile, the Washington Commanders
[ct=5961.611] must have set their alarm clock for about 9:45 PM Eastern time
[ct=5966.315] because they woke up, and they woke up in a hurry
[ct=5969.381] after that horrific first half.
[ct=5972.033] Down the field they go in exactly three minutes,
[ct=5976.122] five first downs along the way.
[ct=5978.703] Plus Ron Rivera's comment to Kaylee.
[ct=5981.272] "I didn't talk to them.
[ct=5981.374] They talked to themselves."
[ct=5983.913] "Let's play for each other."
[ct=5985.226] Perfect.
[ct=5989.221] One more touchback.
[ct=5990.600] Well, what a first half for Justin Fields and the ability
[ct=5993.410] to get the ball out of his hands quicker than we've
[ct=5997.193] seen this year.
[ct=5998.527] 3.2 is a little bit long, but he had
[ct=5999.849] time to make the read because of the offensive line here.
[ct=6002.620] Much quicker with the pressure in his face.
[ct=6005.159] Able to make another great throw downfield.
[ct=6007.777] Here, even faster, 2.1 for the tight end to the--
[ct=6011.760] touchdown to the big tight end Kmet.
[ct=6013.194] So he has been in that zone.
[ct=6015.751] He's felt good every single possession.
[ct=6018.451] Points up on the board for the Bears.
[ct=6021.603] Near perfect first half offensively
[ct=6025.078] and defensively as well.
[ct=6029.065] Second half, Fields coming back the other way.
[ct=6037.016] He turns it into about a 3 yard gain.
[ct=6041.012] A lot of excitement there, and again, we
[ct=6043.663] thought we'd see more of this, him trying to get to the edge.
[ct=6046.288] They didn't really hide this at all.
[ct=6049.010] He just got a lead blocker with Herbert,
[ct=6050.267] but good job by the corner and the safety,
[ct=6052.969] beating him to the spot.
[ct=6053.237] Instead of him just giving up on the play,
[ct=6055.618] because of his athletic ability, he
[ct=6056.969] tries to keep that play alive.
[ct=6057.336] But that's the way you want to start if you're the Commanders
[ct=6060.994] defense, containing Fields and keeping him short of picking
[ct=6066.266] up some big yards.
[ct=6067.551] Once he went down, it was spotted after only a one yard
[ct=6072.836] pickup.
[ct=6074.193] Second and 9 for the fake toss.
[ct=6076.872] Keeps it himself.
[ct=6077.230] There he goes for a first down.
[ct=6084.120] The right tackle and rookie out of Tennessee
[ct=6086.587] was their first round pick.
[ct=6087.858] It's a really good follow up there by Luke Getsy.
[ct=6091.770] The defense is worried about the perimeter.
[ct=6093.054] They're worried about everything going outside
[ct=6095.766] because of the success in the first half.
[ct=6097.052] Instead, he fakes it and then counters back the other way
[ct=6099.827] and got some great blocks by that offensive line.
[ct=6102.540] You're right, Darnell Wright, the rookie right tackle,
[ct=6105.369] and Cole Kmet led the way that time for the first down.
[ct=6110.721] What a threat as a runner, Justin Fields.
[ct=6113.906] 9 carries the night.
[ct=6115.324] 42 yards.
[ct=6118.981] Tipped and incomplete.
[ct=6121.452] Montez Sweat got a hand on it.
[ct=6125.591] DaRon Payne forced that issue on the rush.
[ct=6128.651] Second and 10.
[ct=6129.799] What a match up here against Nate Davis.
[ct=6133.589] This is a tough matchup to the inside.
[ct=6136.257] Sweat's going to end up getting his hand on the football,
[ct=6138.975] but reason he's able to make that play is what you see right
[ct=6142.999] there, is the big fella, Daron Payne,
[ct=6144.348] look at him shed Davis and then pick up momentum.
[ct=6148.542] Field very fortunate to even get that ball out.
[ct=6158.906] Pressure, and that's caught.
[ct=6160.218] Moore gets back into the action after that.
[ct=6164.218] DJ Moore had eight catches last week.
[ct=6169.511] Tonight, after a quick five, his first one
[ct=6173.476] since early in the second.
[ct=6174.817] Six targets, six catches.
[ct=6176.544] The adjustments Jack Del Rio has made
[ct=6180.166] is more movement with that front.
[ct=6181.461] They weren't able to win in the first half.
[ct=6182.797] He's adding linebackers now and blitzing that time
[ct=6186.815] with Jamin Davis.
[ct=6198.783] Third and 5.
[ct=6200.119] Fields under pressure.
[ct=6201.372] Escapes again.
[ct=6202.734] A little bit low, and it's Herbert there.
[ct=6206.704] Does not make the grab.
[ct=6209.712] Incomplete.
[ct=6210.744] Got rid of it through a too low fourth down,
[ct=6214.695] and Herbert is down.
[ct=6217.335] He bent backwards.
[ct=6218.685] The pressure is by Chase Young out here.
[ct=6221.305] Fields does a good job of stepping up,
[ct=6222.794] away from the pressure, and then he's a threat to run.
[ct=6226.562] And it puts Davis in a tough spot.
[ct=6227.700] He takes Fields, and that's where you worry about Herbert
[ct=6231.344] there, having to bend backwards to try to make that catch.
[ct=6236.379] And still work on Fields as we take a break--
[ct=6246.946] The regular season is just 18 weeks, just three days a week.
[ct=6251.857] Sometimes, just one game a day.
[ct=6253.053] So cherish every over and under before it's over on FanDuel
[ct=6260.723] because, before you know it, a cold night at the Buffalo Bills
[ct=6267.986] Bet $5 and get $200 in bonus bets guaranteed.
[ct=6275.838] Josh.
[ct=6277.247] It's like they don't even believe the NFL on CBS streams
[ct=6279.889] live on Paramount Plus.
[ct=6282.360] Higher education isn't what it used to be.
[ct=6284.979] The NFL on CBS streams live on Paramount Plus.
[ct=6290.251] The NFL on CBS streams live--
[ct=6291.447] (SPEAKING TOGETHER) The Paramount Plus.
[ct=6302.127] This is why we teach.
[ct=6305.048] I'll be there in 30 minutes, I think.
[ct=6308.402] See you there.
[ct=6311.817] [dog whining]
[ct=6314.482] [car horns honking]
[ct=6315.806] I'm moving!
[ct=6317.440] Please, please, please, please.
[ct=6319.837] Oh, thank you.
[ct=6324.062] Rerouting.

[ct=6332.590] The all new Hyundai Kona.
[ct=6333.852] KFC's $20 filler box.
[ct=6335.326] (SINGING) Oh, yes, it's chicken night.
[ct=6337.708] Fried chicken night.
[ct=6340.172] Oh, yes, it's chicken night.
[ct=6341.561] Oh, what a night.
[ct=6342.517] Make it a chicken night with free delivery every Thursday.
[ct=6345.937] (SINGING) It's finger lickin' good.
[ct=6351.851] To those who feast on ribs the same way
[ct=6354.486] they feast on the competition, plop, plop, fizz,
[ct=6358.459] fizz, ballers.
[ct=6359.848] Alka-Seltzer, amazing fast heartburn relief.
[ct=6365.120] After the game, stay tuned for TNF Nightcap presented
[ct=6369.115] It's where the biggest stars sit down with our team
[ct=6371.766] to celebrate their win.
[ct=6372.473] The sky's the limit for this team.
[ct=6374.452] These fans are very excited about that.
[ct=6375.747] It's TNF Nightcap presented by Allstate tonight
[ct=6378.621] after the game.
[ct=6382.271] The Lincoln Memorial here in Washington DC.
[ct=6390.385] The good news right now is that Herbert
[ct=6392.899] was able to walk off the field.
[ct=6394.425] Went to commercial.
[ct=6395.508] He was still down there for close to a minute.
[ct=6398.257] They'll put him into the medical tent.
[ct=6399.515] He got bent backwards, and here's
[ct=6400.847] Chicago's first punt of the night.
[ct=6408.437] 11 yard line, Jameson Crowder trying
[ct=6412.366] to go around the left side.
[ct=6412.443] Able to turn the corner and turn it into a decent run back.
[ct=6419.014] 9 and 1/2 left in the third, and Washington with a quick drive.
[ct=6424.423] Three minutes to score and get the two point conversion.
[ct=6428.282] At it again.
[ct=6429.628] Whatever the Commanders, the players, said to each other,
[ct=6432.259] obviously, Ron Rivera's got to be
[ct=6433.607] excited with the idea and the concept and the energy
[ct=6437.482] that they have come out here with.
[ct=6438.988] Offense goes right down the field, five plays
[ct=6441.600] and a touchdown.
[ct=6441.624] Defense gets the Bears offense off the field,
[ct=6444.250] and just like that, they got the football back.
[ct=6446.946] 9 and 1/2 minutes here to go in the third quarter.
[ct=6453.577] Got the ball out underneath screen game that last drive.
[ct=6464.158] Four-man rush.
[ct=6465.513] Gets it away.
[ct=6466.885] Pick up six or seven on that first down play.
[ct=6469.502] They go to Logan Thomas one more time.
[ct=6472.181] He's been the main man, seven targets, seven catches for 56.
[ct=6477.495] Eric Bieniemy loves what he's seeing.
[ct=6478.822] His quarterback is following the orders of, hey,
[ct=6482.797] they're going to take away everything downfield.
[ct=6485.486] Let's send those receivers downfield.
[ct=6486.995] Let's open things up for our tight ends and our
[ct=6489.640] backs out of the backfield.
[ct=6498.799] Empty here.
[ct=6500.099] We go five wide.
[ct=6505.408] It's going to be a first down here.
[ct=6508.054] Thomas tough-- ball comes out.
[ct=6509.403] Chicago thinks they have it, and they do.
[ct=6516.429] Ruling on the field is the ball was fumbled and recovered
[ct=6520.029] by the defense.
[ct=6522.650] Terell Smith comes away with it.
[ct=6524.261] That's the ruling on the field.
[ct=6525.403] Obviously, it gets checked out, so Thomas struggling, straining
[ct=6531.993] for the extra yardage.
[ct=6532.418] Winds up costing him.
[ct=6533.304] Yeah, and Greg Stroman's trying to get at the ball,
[ct=6535.974] but I think it was the rookie Smith, as you said,
[ct=6537.750] not just coming up with it.
[ct=6538.605] Stroman's in there knocking it away,
[ct=6539.965] but I think it's 32, with his right hand right there,
[ct=6543.982] pulls away to get that ball dislodged, and then
[ct=6545.346] right there, presents of mind to jump on it.
[ct=6547.911] How about the rookie out of Minnesota?
[ct=6550.023] Four year starter in college.
[ct=6552.005] Presence of mind to be aware that, hey, we
[ct=6554.203] got a shot to get this football out, and they do.
[ct=6558.996] Forced fumble, fumble recovery.
[ct=6560.266] They've checked it out.
[ct=6563.031] It's kosher, and they have it at the 46 yard line.
[ct=6576.607] Go up with a tight formation here.
[ct=6579.163] Field surveys, and he's going to go in his own territory.
[ct=6584.345] That time, Jonathan Allen got there to get the sack.
[ct=6590.933] Jonathan Allen lined up on the left side
[ct=6593.651] of this offensive line, and really good work here,
[ct=6598.327] being able to not give up on the play.
[ct=6600.824] He's handled there initially, but that
[ct=6602.181] swim move gets him through, and then
[ct=6603.625] he just picks up Justin Fields, who's 230 pounds.
[ct=6607.553] Picks him up and pile drives him into the ground.
[ct=6612.426] There's so much sensitivity to the quarterback and how he gets
[ct=6616.759] touched, and here he's a ball carrier.
[ct=6618.150] But man, that was a power--
[ct=6619.447] just a pile drive into the ground.
[ct=6620.764] Yeah, normally, you got to finesse him down.
[ct=6623.518] Second and 15.
[ct=6624.738] Here they come again.
[ct=6626.082] Off his back foot, Fields throws.
[ct=6628.710] Pressure on that time.
[ct=6629.368] Blasingame was the guy in the neighborhood.
[ct=6631.391] Cody Barton, that time, was the first guy in.
[ct=6634.066] Third and 15, and you've got a flag down.
[ct=6643.310] Scott Novak sidling over to his contemporaries.
[ct=6648.391] There is no foul for an illegal shift.
[ct=6651.194] Please set the play clock to 40 seconds.
[ct=6653.906] 40 on the play clock.
[ct=6658.018] They may not have talked to the players,
[ct=6660.543] but they talked to each other about adjustments as a defense.
[ct=6664.530] And because that front four wasn't winning,
[ct=6667.121] they have dialed up-- you see the backers right there?
[ct=6669.805] It's Barton who gets in there.
[ct=6670.080] They actually brought both the backers on that play.
[ct=6675.291] So third down and 15.
[ct=6685.734] There is a quintessential false start.
[ct=6691.086] False start, offense number 69.
[ct=6693.705] That's a five yard penalty.
[ct=6696.280] Larry Borom, you saw Chase Young coming across the line.
[ct=6702.922] Whitehair moves to center.
[ct=6704.276] Carter now is in at left guard.
[ct=6706.932] They've had a few different combinations
[ct=6709.525] they've been working with, and this
[ct=6710.916] is the first time the crowd has been a factor to affect
[ct=6714.885] the communication up front.
[ct=6716.184] That was actually Ja'Tyre Carter moving over along that line,
[ct=6721.406] where they keep shuffling and juggling
[ct=6724.048] with all of the injuries.
[ct=6725.413] He was called third down and 20.
[ct=6728.000] Fields throwing.
[ct=6730.579] Throws that one away.
[ct=6730.711] Again, the pressure, that time, took care of it,
[ct=6734.587] and they force a quick punt.
[ct=6744.765] have a backup left tackle in Larry Borom who's in no man's
[ct=6746.105] land against Chase Young.
[ct=6747.134] We mentioned Chase Young looks healthier
[ct=6749.815] and looks back to his true form.
[ct=6751.347] Outside move, then gets underneath with that length
[ct=6755.119] and speed, and that really blew the play up.
[ct=6757.763] So again, these Commanders playing
[ct=6760.423] the way we expected them to play all game long,
[ct=6763.086] but it took them a half to get warmed up
[ct=6765.751] and to bring that pressure.
[ct=6768.409] So they survive the turnover, and the punt here
[ct=6775.004] will be down just outside the 15 yard line.
[ct=6777.732] 740 to go in the third quarter.
[ct=6780.344] It's Chicago 27, Washington 11.
[ct=6789.661] My dad went EV.
[ct=6790.953] It's electric.
[ct=6792.174] Don't be shocked.
[ct=6793.617] Nice car.
[ct=6794.923] It's an "ev."
[ct=6796.315] Introducing the all electric Hyundai Ioniq 6
[ct=6799.842] with up to 360 mile range.
[ct=6801.140] When it comes to EVs, we're thinking of every mile.
[ct=6803.814] I'm the heat on the street, and I'm asking women
[ct=6806.467] one burning question.
[ct=6807.755] What's VMS?
[ct=6811.738] I have no idea.
[ct=6813.117] I've never--
[ct=6813.364] I don't know.
[ct=6814.430] What if I told you it actually has to do with menopause?
[ct=6817.056] Yay.
[ct=6817.606] Well, then maybe I would say--
[ct=6819.690] Malicious sweat.
[ct=6821.055] Actually VMS stands for Vasomotor Symptoms,
[ct=6823.717] which is the medical term for hot flashes and night
[ct=6826.387] sweats due to menopause.
[ct=6827.964] That's what's making me hot at night.
[ct=6828.862] More like day and night.
[ct=6830.375] If you're heated about being overheated, go to whatsvms.com
[ct=6833.956] At Firehouse Subs, every sub is stacked
[ct=6836.948] with mouthwatering meats and cheeses in every bite,
[ct=6839.532] packed with big, bold flavors to answer every craving,
[ct=6843.623] served hot on a toasted roll every time.
[ct=6846.421] Only at Firehouse Subs.
[ct=6848.919] Young lady who is mid 30s, a couple of kids,
[ct=6852.911] recently went through a divorce, so she
[ct=6853.990] had a lot of questions when she came in.
[ct=6856.899] I watched my mother go through being a single mom.
[ct=6859.632] At the end of the day, my mom raised three children,
[ct=6864.265] including myself, and so once the client
[ct=6865.740] knew that she was heard, we were able to help her move forward.
[ct=6869.276] Your client won't care how much you know until they
[ct=6873.630] know how much you care.
[ct=6879.995] The NFL is back across the pond--
[ct=6882.082] As Trevor Lawrence and the Jags take
[ct=6884.024] on Josh Allen and the Bills.
[ct=6885.348] Live from London.
[ct=6888.014] Rise, shine, and watch.
[ct=6889.571] I'm him.
[ct=6890.635] Sunday at 9:30 on--
[ct=6891.974] [audio logo]
[ct=6893.551] [musical chord]
[ct=6897.317] Time for Tonight's Journey brought to you by Hyundai.
[ct=6901.354] Fields, in that first half against second straight week,
[ct=6912.962] Washington scoring on the first drive of the second half,
[ct=6914.480] getting the two point conversion.
[ct=6917.116] Bears haven't won since they went to New England
[ct=6918.442] and knocked off the Patriots last October the 24th.
[ct=6923.548] Part of turning a franchise around is not just Xs and Ox.
[ct=6928.830] It's a mentality.
[ct=6929.518] It's learning how to win, and right now, that's
[ct=6933.363] what Matt Eberflus is facing.
[ct=6934.156] He's trying to get his team to not just, hey,
[ct=6937.132] we're playing great for a half.
[ct=6938.435] We want to play 60 minutes.
[ct=6939.796] We want to learn how to win football games.
[ct=6943.201] He knows all too well.
[ct=6947.077] Howell throws.
[ct=6948.438] Slipping a tackle.
[ct=6949.793] Turning it into about a six yard pickup.
[ct=6952.432] Brian Robinson, Kaylee, what do know?
[ct=6953.783] Guys, we don't have official word yet on Bears running back
[ct=6956.969] Khalil Herbert, but he has been running up and down
[ct=6959.118] the sidelines behind the Bears bench,
[ct=6961.495] testing the range of motion of that right ankle
[ct=6964.164] that you saw bend back so uncomfortably.
[ct=6966.856] But that running back group tonight, guys,
[ct=6968.157] they have had a tough go.
[ct=6969.442] Travis Homer, he is now questionable with a hamstring.
[ct=6973.419] Roschon Johnson, that rookie is out
[ct=6976.115] because of a concussion, and D'Onta Foreman, he's inactive.
[ct=6978.741] So they've had to turn to that fullback
[ct=6980.424] Khari Blasingame to get somebody on the field in their place,
[ct=6984.101] but Khalil Herbert looks like he's doing everything
[ct=6986.735] Yeah, we'll see what happens when they're on offense.
[ct=6988.135] Meanwhile, that pass is hauled in by Gibson.
[ct=6991.007] Stays in bounds.
[ct=6992.058] Takes it to the 35 yard line.
[ct=6996.073] Down the sideline goes Gibson over Brister.
[ct=6998.596] That's a gain of 41.
[ct=6999.917] And now, that's the beauty of his versatility.
[ct=7002.084] He's a running back, really, slash receiver,
[ct=7005.239] and he's matched up one on one against Brisker,
[ct=7007.866] who's a safety.
[ct=7009.226] So this is a favorable matchup.
[ct=7010.788] It's not just a running back.
[ct=7012.134] Gibson knows how to run routes.
[ct=7013.556] He knows how to track the football, and a good job
[ct=7017.321] here by Sam Howell locating that matchup.
[ct=7019.937] No safety support.
[ct=7021.321] Gets the ball out at 2.7 seconds.
[ct=7022.651] Yeah, Gibson was the number one running back for two years.
[ct=7025.745] Now, he finds himself as a backup,
[ct=7028.676] and in Memphis, he did everything.
[ct=7032.421] To the 40, 35 yard line.
[ct=7033.736] That pass is caught, and taking it to the 20, Dotson.
[ct=7040.299] Jahan Dotson, number one pick out of Penn State last season.
[ct=7048.070] Now, you'll love this.
[ct=7048.100] Eyes just on Brisker.
[ct=7049.129] Comes down, quickly knows he's got that glance route,
[ct=7053.138] and he makes the decision off of Brisker coming down.
[ct=7055.737] He would have worked to the outside if he stayed back.
[ct=7058.056] Instead, he saw him slide down after the snap there,
[ct=7060.508] trying to fool him, being as young as he is,
[ct=7063.487] but he recognized it quickly and got the ball out in a hurry.
[ct=7068.885] At the 21.
[ct=7075.124] Sack, big play Stroman, who had the interception that
[ct=7080.902] led to a touchdown at the end of the first half
[ct=7083.439] and started his career with Washington.
[ct=7087.437] And now, again, we just talked about how they're disguising,
[ct=7090.674] trying to fool him.
[ct=7091.976] Look at this safety right now.
[ct=7093.245] He doesn't look like he's going to cheat down and help out.
[ct=7095.934] See how they're hiding that blitz, and eventually late,
[ct=7098.648] this blitz comes right there.
[ct=7099.941] Safety comes over to take that zone area
[ct=7104.282] and completely-- you don't see his head.
[ct=7105.757] He doesn't even look.
[ct=7106.910] They disguised it so well, he didn't even
[ct=7109.361] look to think that was a threat to his left, to the blind side.
[ct=7113.342] Nine yard sack.
[ct=7114.618] Second and 19.
[ct=7117.039] Caught inside the 30.
[ct=7119.928] Dotson to the 22.
[ct=7122.816] Third and long.
[ct=7127.937] Gain of seven.
[ct=7128.964] It'll be third and 12.
[ct=7131.945] 4 and 1/2 to go in the third.
[ct=7137.229] Matt Eberflus, who has taken over not just, obviously,
[ct=7139.864] head coaching duties, he's taken over as a defensive coordinator
[ct=7143.829] He said he's able to manage throughout the week
[ct=7146.498] and still, obviously, deal with his day
[ct=7149.131] to day job as a head coach.
[ct=7150.484] But he's in there getting his defense prepared,
[ct=7154.469] going back to his roots.
[ct=7157.095] Rush four.
[ct=7158.443] Howell steps up.
[ct=7159.789] Runs into traffic.
[ct=7161.108] Gets away and stays in bounds and comes
[ct=7167.748] close to a first down.
[ct=7169.045] What a move, avoiding tackles, almost stepped out of bounds,
[ct=7173.088] and he's going to set up a fourth down and 2.
[ct=7176.790] But the athletic ability here, we've
[ct=7178.436] talked all night about Justin Fields being a threat
[ct=7180.989] and what he can do as a runner and a scrambler and ability
[ct=7186.323] They're booing because the field goal unit's coming out,
[ct=7188.675] but I mean, this looks like he's done.
[ct=7191.674] He's sacked.
[ct=7191.715] A stunt offensive line doesn't pick it up.
[ct=7194.343] I almost think he was ready to give up on it,
[ct=7196.961] but he just keeps kind of fighting it.
[ct=7198.320] Pump fake right there.
[ct=7202.286] So a 32 yard attempt.
[ct=7205.020] Washington trying to make it a 13 point deficit.
[ct=7210.236] Slye's kick is good.
[ct=7212.526] Crowd wanted him to go for it on the fourth,
[ct=7214.244] and it would have been fourth and 3.
[ct=7216.900] And with 3:17 to go in the third, 27-14 Bears.
[ct=7229.397] I am no devil.
[ct=7243.279] (SINGING) Bigfoot, Bigfoot, get out the way.
[ct=7245.712] Bussing out there I'll be messing all day.
[ct=7247.450] Bussing out bails, we were selling that hay.
[ct=7250.964] We were moving that soul--
[ct=7252.314] Your light binder's ready.
[ct=7252.697] Can you order me 400 more of these headphones?
[ct=7255.588] (SINGING) I'ma show y'all how to move.
[ct=7257.056] Hey!
[ct=7258.291] You're going to like this story because it's
[ct=7259.605] about you, you who forgot to charge your phone last night,
[ct=7262.266] you who sprints to the boarding line
[ct=7263.604] so your bag will fit, you with him.
[ct=7266.245] Until one day, you boarded a United plane
[ct=7268.899] that was designed for, well, you,
[ct=7271.578] and your phone got charged.
[ct=7272.875] Your bag fit.
[ct=7273.105] So did everyone else's, but this story isn't about them.
[ct=7275.551] Your toddler didn't tantrum, and you
[ct=7277.285] got to fly happily ever after, the end.
[ct=7287.850] It's a beautiful day for football
[ct=7289.136] and a beautiful day for a Bills victory.
[ct=7292.882] Bills lose 0 to 13.
[ct=7295.534] Pitched that one down the sideline.
[ct=7299.533] Now, Norwood trying to kick is longest ever on grass.
[ct=7303.523] Score by Flutie.
[ct=7305.344] Go, Bills.
[ct=7307.507] Go, Buffalo!
[ct=7310.132] Thank you, grandpa.
[ct=7311.506] How do I look?
[ct=7312.915] Looks terrific.
[ct=7320.640] Amazon Music Live back at midnight Eastern time.
[ct=7322.351] Chicago rapper, Lil Durk, and our main host, 2 Chainz.
[ct=7327.421] Tune in right here on Prime Video.
[ct=7328.733] When the game ends, live music will begin.
[ct=7333.273] Looking up at the Washington Monument.
[ct=7334.381] Well, Dick Butkus passed away earlier today.
[ct=7338.334] There he was with George Halas and Gale Sayers.
[ct=7340.943] Sayers and Butkus were picked in the first round in 1965.
[ct=7347.634] They had the third and fourth picks.
[ct=7350.300] And when those two guys got honored a number of years ago,
[ct=7352.951] on either a Sunday or Monday night game at Soldier Field,
[ct=7358.288] you had Sayers and Butkus.
[ct=7358.459] I'll never forget, one of the newspapers
[ct=7360.888] had the headline was the picture of the two, Beauty
[ct=7363.807] and the Beast.
[ct=7367.712] Gale's hair is so smooth.
[ct=7370.204] And Dick Butkus is really the measure
[ct=7372.882] of linebackers from the time he played in college
[ct=7375.622] and forced a brilliant career in Chicago.
[ct=7378.192] Everybody compared everybody to Dick Butkus.
[ct=7380.809] But a man with a great sense of humor
[ct=7386.171] turned into a pretty good acting career.
[ct=7392.768] You got Trevor Lawrence picked first,
[ct=7394.118] you got Zach Wilson picked second, Lance third,
[ct=7396.761] so Lawrence working out pretty well.
