[ct=5.270] CAN REMEMBER BEFORE A JETS GAME.
[ct=16.752] THERE HE IS AGAIN, LEADING THE
[ct=17.916] JETS.
[ct=28.916] THE PATRIOTS WON THE TOSS.
[ct=32.192] THE JETS WILL RECEIVE.
[ct=36.492] WE WILL SEE ROGERS -- RODGERS
[ct=36.492] RIGHT OFF THE BAT.
[ct=40.171] THE DYNAMIC KICKOFF RESULTING IN
[ct=42.567] A FEW MORE TOUCHBACKS THAN MOST
[ct=42.807] PEOPLE EXPECTED.
[ct=46.510] I LOOK AT METLIFE STADIUM.
[ct=51.845] ADORNED IN GREEN, WE WILL BE
[ct=52.192] HERE NEXT THURSDAY NIGHT WHEN IT
[ct=54.534] WILL BE BLUE AS THE GIANT TAKE
[ct=55.769] ON THE COWBOYS ON THURSDAY NIGHT
[ct=56.278] FOOTBALL.
[ct=67.153] XAVIER GIPSON, WHO RAN A PUNT
[ct=69.699] BACK AGAINST BUFFALO ON OPENING
[ct=72.274] NIGHT LAST YEAR.
[ct=77.665] BACK TO RECEIVE AND RODGERS AND
[ct=79.005] COMPANY WILL TAKE OVER AT THE 30
[ct=80.281] YARD LINE.
[ct=86.852] WE HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION, OUR
[ct=91.234] MEETING WITH RODGERS, HE IS AS
[ct=92.554] EXCITED AS HE HAS EVER BEEN AND
[ct=95.209] SAVORING THE MOMENT AT 40 YEARS
[ct=95.209] OLD.
[ct=99.224] HE IS TOTALLY IMMERSED IN THE
[ct=100.577] JETS AND THEIR FORTUNES THIS
[ct=101.962] YEAR.
[ct=106.225] KIRK: WE TALKED TO HIM FOR ABOUT
[ct=107.213] AN HOUR AND HE TALKED ABOUT THE
[ct=108.354] PROCESS, IT IS NOT JUST THE GAME
[ct=113.632] BUT HE LOVES MONDAY THROUGH
[ct=113.632] WEDNESDAY GETTING READY FOR THE
[ct=114.966] GAME.
[ct=117.516] AL: THE RUNNING BACK IS BREECE
[ct=118.857] HALL.
[ct=121.579] PLAY-ACTION, THE THROW AND IT IS
[ct=122.727] CAUGHT FOR A 5 YARD GAIN.
[ct=125.791] GARRETT WILSON STOP BY GONZALES.
[ct=129.062] KIRK: HE MADE A BIG POINT THIS
[ct=132.982] WEEK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE --
[ct=134.417] THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS AARON
[ct=135.073] RODGERS TALKED ABOUT, WE HAVE TO
[ct=136.556] GET HIM THE BALL EARLY.
[ct=141.003] AL: THEY GO NO-HUDDLE TO QUICKEN
[ct=141.595] THE PACE.
[ct=147.218] AARON SURVEYING ON A SECOND DOWN
[ct=148.560] AND 4.
[ct=150.739] HERE COMES THE BLITZ, IT IS
[ct=151.262] PICKED UP.
[ct=155.861] SLIDES TO A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=162.954] HE WAS PICKED UP ON THE BLOCK IN
[ct=163.406] THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=165.204] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=169.412] KIRK: THE WHOLE STADIUM EXCITED,
[ct=173.124] AND ON THE OTHER, GET DOWN, TAKE
[ct=173.327] CARE OF YOURSELF AFTER A YEAR
[ct=173.549] AGO.
[ct=177.128] AL: FROM THE 41 YARD LINE.
[ct=186.316] HE BROUGHT THAT FROM GREEN BAY
[ct=189.099] WITH HIM, AND THAT IS CALLED IN
[ct=190.581] -- HAULED IN.
[ct=192.468] MIKE WILLIAMS.
[ct=197.459] THEY WILL SPOT HIM, THEY SPOTTED
[ct=197.932] HIM LAST WEEK AND PROBABLY AGAIN
[ct=198.370] TONIGHT.
[ct=202.769] KIRK: NINE SNAPS ON THE OPENER
[ct=203.576] AGAINST SAN FRANCISCO, LOOK AT
[ct=204.321] THE EFFORT AND THE LENGTH HE
[ct=204.491] HAS.
[ct=206.935] HE COULD BE A SECRET
[ct=209.589] THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF GARRETT
[ct=209.826] WILSON.
[ct=212.954] THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE MIKE
[ct=216.657] WILLIAMS GET HEALTHY AND BE THAT
[ct=216.657] THIRD OPTION.
[ct=222.075] AL: SECOND AND 5, QUICK THROW
[ct=222.852] OUTSIDE, ACROSS THE 50.
[ct=225.662] FIRST DOWN AT THE 43 YARD LINE.
[ct=230.613] MARCUS JONES GOT STIFF-ARMED.
[ct=232.945] FIRST DOWN, NEW YORK.
[ct=236.918] KIRK: THIS IS THE CHALLENGE
[ct=237.843] AGAINST AARON RODGERS, YOU WILL
[ct=239.659] SIT BACK, BE SOFT, AND GIVE HIM
[ct=241.389] THE QUICK THROW, HE WILL TAKE
[ct=241.632] IT.
[ct=244.806] THE OFFENSIVE LINE IS RUNNING A
[ct=247.068] PLAY, HE HAS THAT QUICK THROW TO
[ct=249.568] LAZARD.
[ct=251.633] I DON'T KNOW IF ANOTHER
[ct=253.349] QUARTERBACK HAS THE FIELD
[ct=255.920] PRE-SNAP BETTER THAN AARON
[ct=256.173] RODGERS.
[ct=265.457] AL: RODGERS LOOKING LEFT, NOW
[ct=267.557] RIGHT, FLUSHED OUT.
[ct=271.343] DOWNFIELD, GOING TO THE END
[ct=272.666] ZONE, AND BROKEN UP IN THE END
[ct=272.666] ZONE.
[ct=275.304] JONATHAN JONES BREAKING IT UP.
[ct=277.795] IT WAS MIKE WILLIAMS WHO COULD
[ct=280.501] NOT HAUL IT IN.
[ct=282.918] KIRK: MORGAN MOSES WILL BE
[ct=283.546] CALLED FOR HOLDING HERE.
[ct=288.423] >> HOLDING, OFFENSE #78.
[ct=290.506] 10 YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN.
[ct=294.258] KIRK: RODGERS GOT OUT OF THE
[ct=294.894] POCKET AND MOSES STARTS TO PANIC
[ct=296.827] AND LOCK UP.
[ct=302.285] THAT WAS JENNINGS.
[ct=307.645] FOR A GUY COMING OFF AN ACHILLES
[ct=309.422] , BOUNCING AROUND AND LOOKING
[ct=310.102] GOOD ON THIS OPENING DRIVE.
[ct=312.271] AL: ABSOLUTELY.
[ct=315.609] IT WAS A FAST REHAB.
[ct=319.387] HAD THEY BEEN IN PLAYOFF
[ct=321.981] CONTENTION, THE IDEA OF HIM
[ct=323.964] COMING BACK.
[ct=327.507] RODGERS UNDER PRESSURE, DOWN HE
[ct=329.770] GOES, SACKED AT THE 41.
[ct=336.249] HE IS TAKEN DOWN FOR THE SECOND.
[ct=341.480] IT WILL BE SECOND AND 26.
[ct=345.846] KIRK: THEY LIKE TO STUNT, MOVE
[ct=348.516] AROUND FROM THE OUTSIDE IN, AND
[ct=351.279] AFFECTED THE OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=351.975] YOU HAVE THREE NEW PIECES UP
[ct=352.329] FRONT.
[ct=355.542] SIMPSON AND SMITH ARE STILL
[ct=357.143] FEELING EACH OTHER OUT AND
[ct=358.284] TRYING TO COMMUNICATE.
[ct=361.707] THAT TIME THE PATRIOTS WERE ABLE
[ct=362.005] TO GET THAT PRESSURE.
[ct=368.999] AL: SECOND AND 26, TRIES TO PICK
[ct=371.191] UP A FEW ON THE RUN.
[ct=372.582] BREECE HALL.
[ct=379.360] THEY BROUGHT IN TWO VETERAN
[ct=380.391] TACKLES, SMITH WHO CAME WITH THE
[ct=381.075] COWBOYS.
[ct=386.759] AND MORGAN MOSES, HIS 11TH YEAR
[ct=387.380] FOR BALTIMORE.
[ct=391.075] KIRK: YOU THROW IN SIMPSON AT
[ct=393.313] LEFT GUARD, AND TUCKER, THE
[ct=395.108] RIGHT GUARD, A FORMER FIRST
[ct=395.450] ROUNDER WENT OUT WITH AN
[ct=401.223] ACHILLES HIMSELF.
[ct=403.921] FOUR GUYS TRYING TO COME
[ct=406.567] TOGETHER.
[ct=411.967] AL: THIRD AND 19.
[ct=415.997] FOUR MAN RUSH, CUTTING BACK TO
[ct=416.453] THE 33 YARD LINE.
[ct=419.854] IT WAS BREECE HALL.
[ct=422.403] PEPPERS MAKING THE TACKLE.
[ct=427.040] FOURTH AND LONG, AND THEY WILL
[ct=428.324] SEND IN IN ALL LIKELIHOOD THE
[ct=428.627] PUNT GROUP.
[ct=430.946] THESE DAYS, WHO KNOWS.
[ct=436.408] THE 58 YARD FIELD GOAL IS LIKE A
[ct=437.640] CHIP SHOT THESE DAYS.
[ct=445.509] MARCUS JONES SETS UP INSIDE THE
[ct=445.509] 10.
[ct=461.044] HE PUTS SOME BACKSPIN ON IT AND
[ct=461.704] IT BOUNCES INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=465.154] MID-70'S.
[ct=465.154] THERE IS THE STATUE OF LIBERTY.
[ct=467.818] WE ARE BACK AT METLIFE OR THE
[ct=471.684] PASS HAVE THE BALL -- THE PATS
[ct=472.169] HAVE THE BALL.
[ct=475.764] A PLAY FAKE, AND NO GAIN THAT
[ct=475.764] TIME.
[ct=481.179] WILLIAMS MADE THE TACKLE ON
[ct=483.752] HENRY, WHO CAUGHT EIGHT OF THE
[ct=485.187] 17 COMPLETIONS LAST WEEK IN THE
[ct=485.725] GAME AGAINST SEATTLE.
[ct=487.970] JACOBY BRISSETT IS A GREAT
[ct=488.524] STORY.
[ct=491.148] THROUGH THE YEARS PERSEVERING.
[ct=494.329] HE HAS BEEN IN SOME STRANGE AND
[ct=494.581] ODD PLACES.
[ct=496.703] A LOOK AT HIS CAREER NUMBERS, HE
[ct=499.605] WAS DRAFTED BY THE PATRIOTS OUT
[ct=502.680] OF N.C. STATE IN THE THIRD ROUND
[ct=502.873] IN 2016.
[ct=509.814] TO THE RIGHT SIDE, ONLY A YARD
[ct=512.948] GAINED BY STEPHENSON --
[ct=514.576] STEVENSON.
[ct=517.431] KIRK: THIS IS AN OFFENSE THAT
[ct=518.723] WANTS TO BE SMART.
[ct=520.962] WITH WHERE THEY ARE WITH RESET
[ct=522.882] AND WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE
[ct=524.177] OFFENSIVE LINE, THEY HAVE TO
[ct=524.753] STAY AHEAD OF THE CHAINS.
[ct=527.214] THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO BE THIRD
[ct=531.447] AND 9 AGAINST THE JETS DEFENSE.
[ct=533.452] TWO ROOKIES ARE STARTING
[ct=539.496] KAYDEN WALLACE MAKING HIS FIRST
[ct=540.149] CAREER START AT LEFT TACKLE.
[ct=544.445] AL: ALEX VAN PELT COMES OVER
[ct=544.943] FROM CLEVELAND TO RUN THE
[ct=545.240] OFFENSE.
[ct=550.735] LOOK OUT, PRESSURE IS PUT ON.
[ct=555.004] THAT TIME IT WAS QUINCY WILLIAMS
[ct=555.004] COMING IN.
[ct=557.918] THE QUARTERBACK WAS OUT OF THE
[ct=560.083] POCKET.
[ct=562.715] MAYO TOLD US IN OUR MEETING THAT
[ct=565.155] THE KEY WILL BE TO TAKE CARE OF
[ct=568.270] THEIR FRONT BUT THAT JETS' FRONT
[ct=569.022] SO FAR AS BURSTING THROUGH.
[ct=573.673] KIRK: THEY ARE NOT HAVING A PITY
[ct=574.188] PARTY FOR THIS INEXPERIENCED
[ct=574.296] OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=578.618] THIS OFFENSE HAS TO BE IN THOSE
[ct=582.416] THIRD AND MANAGEABLE, THIRD AND
[ct=586.890] 9 WILL NOT WORK WITH THIS
[ct=595.265] AL: GIBSON IS BACK AND MAKES THE
[ct=595.265] CATCH ALONG THE SIDELINE.
[ct=599.042] PICKS UP ABOUT THREE MORE YARDS,
[ct=606.847] ⠀THIS LAST YEAR WITH

[ct=613.198] ⠀SECOND DOWN.
[ct=613.545] ⠀WHERE THE QUARTERBACK

[ct=616.230] ⠀ALERT OF THE PRESSURE,
[ct=617.600] ⠀WHERE IT MIGHT COME
[ct=619.858] ⠀FROM AND THAT TIME THE
[ct=620.959] ⠀ALERTS WERE DEAD ON
[ct=622.279] ⠀WITH THAT PRESSURE
[ct=623.704] ⠀FROM THE JETS.
[ct=627.475] ⠀AL: THE 20-YEAR-OLD
[ct=630.313] ⠀ROOKIE, THE YOUNGEST
[ct=633.008] ⠀PLAYER IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=634.146] ⠀YOUTH MUST BE SERVED.

[ct=3157.133] TOUCHDOWN, THE PLAY COMES BACK,
[ct=3161.959] AND AARON IS CHALLENGING WILSON
[ct=3163.158] TO LEARN TO TAKE THAT STEP IS A
[ct=3164.499] THIRD-YEAR PLAY.
[ct=3168.428] RIDICULOUS TALENT AND SKILL SET,
[ct=3169.640] BUT HE IS CHALLENGING HIM TO DO
[ct=3171.165] THE MENTAL ASPECT OF THE GAME,
[ct=3175.339] AND AARON WILL IMPACT HIS
[ct=3175.339] CAREER.
[ct=3181.612] AL: EVERYBODY UPTIGHT THERE.
[ct=3186.502] ALAN FLARES MAKES THAT CATCH.
[ct=3191.618] BOUCHER MAKING THE STOP THERE.
[ct=3197.278] IT IS THIRD DOWN, AT AND 5.
[ct=3199.857] WE WILL TAKE A TIMEOUT.
[ct=3202.031] TIMEOUT.
[ct=3206.004] AL: ROBERT KRAFT IS IN H
[ct=3209.941] HE BOUGHT THIS TEAM BACK IN
[ct=3209.941] 1994.
[ct=3212.262] THERE HE IS WITH HIS SON
[ct=3212.262] JONATHAN KRAFT.
[ct=3216.324] HAS WATCH THIS TEAM GO TO 10
[ct=3217.752] SUPER BALLS AND WIN SIX OF THEM.
[ct=3221.658] NINE SUPER BOWL'S AND SIX TOO
[ct=3222.950] WINS UNDER BELLA CHECK.
[ct=3225.319] BUT THE TEAM FOR LESS THAN $200
[ct=3226.793] MILLION.
[ct=3228.022] YOU KNOW WHO TRIED TO BUY THE
[ct=3229.471] TEAM?
[ct=3233.396] JEFF LURIE.
[ct=3240.207] KRAFT WON THE BID, SO HER
[ct=3241.477] EAGLES.
[ct=3243.767] KIRK: BOTH WORKED
[ct=3245.076] WELL.
[ct=3246.312] I WAS DOWN THERE ON THE FIELD
[ct=3247.728] ANY COMES UP AND STARTS TALKING.
[ct=3250.192] DO YOU WANT TO COME SAY HELLO TO
[ct=3251.469] MY GUY?
[ct=3252.716] WE WILL HEAD UP TOGETHER?
[ct=3256.464] AL: HE MAKES THE ROUNDS.
[ct=3258.039] AT DOWN AND 5.
[ct=3260.720] PRESSURE, CAUGHT
[ct=3261.972] MIDDLE.
[ct=3264.419] MIKE WILLIAMS TO THE 20 YARD
[ct=3267.593] LINE, SO IF THIRD DOWN AND 5.
[ct=3270.700] NEW YORK NOW TAKES A TIMEOUT.
[ct=3272.796] THEIR FINAL.
[ct=3277.071] KIRK: VERY RISKY TO BRING THIS
[ct=3278.426] PRESSURE HERE, BECAUSE OF THE
[ct=3280.840] OPENING RIGHT HERE, AND THAT IS
[ct=3280.840] EXACTLY WHERE AARON RODGERS
[ct=3282.183] WANTS TO GO.
[ct=3287.765] BRUCE ROGERS DID A GOOD JOB OF
[ct=3289.296] STEPPING UP.
[ct=3293.759] SO GOOD TO SEE WILLIAM ZUBAC FOR
[ct=3293.759] THE 2023 SEASON.
[ct=3297.635] THEY WERE TO BACK EARLY AGAIN
[ct=3298.723] SAN FRANCISCO WITH THE NINE
[ct=3298.723] SNAPS LAST WEEK.
[ct=3302.827] A LOT MORE WITH 35, AND IF HE
[ct=3304.117] KEEPS COMING ALONG I THINK THAT
[ct=3305.660] IS THE THIRD OPTION ALONG WITH
[ct=3308.370] THE TWO BACKS IN THE BACKFIELD
[ct=3309.730] THEY CAN MAKE THIS OFFENSE
[ct=3309.730] DANGEROUS TO STOP.
[ct=3320.765] AL: 15.5 AVERAGE PER CATCH, SO
[ct=3323.647] HE IS THE HOME RUN HITTER.
[ct=3337.533] OUTSIDE AND INCOMPLETE, SO THE
[ct=3338.645] SECONDARY DOES ITS JOB DEEP.
[ct=3342.603] DUGGER COVERS ON THE PLAY,
[ct=3343.870] SECOND AND 10.
[ct=3348.027] KIRK: DEBATE THING WITH THE
[ct=3352.100] DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, YOU ARE
[ct=3352.100] GOING UP AGAINST AARON RODGERS.
[ct=3355.559] THE BIG THING WE HAVE TO DO IS
[ct=3355.559] POST SNAP MOVEMENT.
[ct=3359.826] IF HE KNOWS WHAT YOU ARE IN, YOU
[ct=3360.070] WERE DEAD.
[ct=3361.869] IT IS TOUGH TONIGHT BECAUSE YOU
[ct=3364.195] SEE AARON RODGERS IN THIS GROOVE
[ct=3365.592] BEING GOOD, SEEING THE FIELD
[ct=3366.687] WELL, BUT THAT WAS ONE OF THE
[ct=3367.932] FEW TIMES A NIGHT WHERE THEY
[ct=3370.801] WERE ABLE TO DO MOVEMENT LATE,
[ct=3371.495] AND IT IMPACTED THE FLOW AND
[ct=3374.828] RHYTHM OF AARON RODGERS AND THE
[ct=3375.108] RECEIVERS.
[ct=3383.188] AL: RUSH, AARON RODGERS SURVEYS,
[ct=3384.683] GOING FORWARD, AND THROWS ABOUT
[ct=3385.481] ONE OUT OF THE BACK OF THE END
[ct=3390.173] THE SECONDARY MINUS PEPPERS AT
[ct=3390.348] THE MOMENT DOING ITS JOB, AND
[ct=3393.693] AARON LEADING HIS CASE WITH
[ct=3398.348] MUSSEY, WHY DID A PENALTY AND
[ct=3399.458] WILL NOT GET ONE.
[ct=3403.417] KIRK: I THINK HE SAW SOME
[ct=3403.885] CONTACT DOWNFIELD.
[ct=3410.651] REFEREE: THERE IS NO INTENTIONAL
[ct=3410.651] GROUND.
[ct=3411.304] THE BALL WENT OVER HIS HEAD.
[ct=3414.998] KIRK: AT THAT ONE TIMEOUT WITH
[ct=3415.219] 14 SECONDS LEFT.
[ct=3422.373] AL: BUT IF YOU KEEP IT IN THE
[ct=3422.572] FIELD OF PLAY, YOU CANNOT SPIKE
[ct=3426.106] BECAUSE IT WOULD BE FOURTH DOWN
[ct=3429.274] IF YOU DO NOT GIVE AT LEAST 10,
[ct=3430.654] AND NOBODY KNOWS THAT BETTER
[ct=3435.781] THAN AARON WHAT HE HAS TO DO,
[ct=3436.276] AND ZONE OR SIDELINE.
[ct=3439.790] EVERYTHING ELSE DANGEROUS.
[ct=3444.946] HE HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE.
[ct=3446.320] HE KNOWS.
[ct=3448.937] 3RD AND 10.
[ct=3452.510] AND NOW YOU HAVE GOT A TIMEOUT
[ct=3452.792] BY THE PATRIOTS.
[ct=3456.169] REFEREE: TIMEOUT BY NEW ENGLAND.
[ct=3458.926] THIS WILL BE A YEAR.
[ct=3465.088] NOT OPOSSUM OUT THERE IN
[ct=3467.536] MANHATTAN TONIGHT RUNNING AROUND
[ct=3468.753] WITH ALL OF THE RATS MAYOR ADAMS
[ct=3469.324] IS TRYING TO GET RID OF.
[ct=3473.277] THIRD DOWN AND 10.
[ct=3484.855] RODGERS TO THE OUTSIDE, AND THAT
[ct=3487.653] IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=3488.747] SO IT IS FOURTH DOWN, AND THAT
[ct=3492.891] WILL BRING IN ZERO LINE --
[ct=3498.015] ZURLINE TO MAKE IT AN ADVANTAGE.
[ct=3501.568] GREG ZUERLEIN, 13 YEARS IN THE
[ct=3503.041] LEAGUE.
[ct=3507.067] TELL YOU WHAT, HE KICKED ONE OF
[ct=3508.046] THE MOST CLUTCH FIELD GOALS.
[ct=3513.765] WITH THE RAMS IN OVERTIME, LIKE
[ct=3517.611] A 61 YARDER TO GIVE THEM THE
[ct=3518.995] ROAD TO THE SUPER BOWL.
[ct=3522.759] OTHERWISE NEW ORLEANS THAT DAY
[ct=3525.309] HAD A FIRST DOWN AND 2 AND THEY
[ct=3525.309] GO TO THE SUPER BOWL.
[ct=3529.129] GREG ZUERLEIN, AND THIS TIME HE
[ct=3529.129] MISSES.
[ct=3533.017] GREG ZUERLEIN AT THE END OF THAT
[ct=3534.004] DRIVE CANNOT TACK ON THREE AND
[ct=3537.131] THE JETS SETTLE FOR AN 11 POINT
[ct=3537.131] MARGIN.
[ct=3541.620] KIRK: HE JUST MISSES THIS.
[ct=3545.306] HOOKING FACT OF THE LEFT SO THE
[ct=3546.627] PATRIOTS CATCH A BREAK HERE.
[ct=3550.331] THINKING ABOUT TRYING TO STOP
[ct=3551.636] AARON RODGERS FROM PUTTING SIX
[ct=3552.871] ON THE BOARD, THEN THEY SETTLE
[ct=3555.308] FOR 3 AND THEY END UP GETTING
[ct=3558.139] OUT OF HERE 14-3.
[ct=3561.830] GETTING THE BALL TO START THE
[ct=3561.830] SECOND HALF, THAT
[ct=3563.358] WIN FOR NEW ENGLAND.
[ct=3567.312] AL: YEAH, THEY GET THE BALL TO
[ct=3568.624] START THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=3575.096] AND 7 TICKS LEFT.
[ct=3580.182] OF COURSE THAT IS GOING TO
[ct=3581.600] THROW, AND THEY WILL CALL A
[ct=3583.041] TIMEOUT HERE AND DO SOMETHING.
[ct=3585.442] I DO NOT KNOW WHAT.
[ct=3587.515] DEMARIO DOUGLAS MADE THE CATCH.
[ct=3593.595] WITHIN THE INEXPERIENCED OFFENSE
[ct=3601.279] KIRK: WITH THE INEXPERIENCED
[ct=3601.279] OFFENSE, THE JETS USUALLY RELI
[ct=3602.604] PRESSURE, BUT HERE IS CHUCK
[ct=3603.604] CLARK COMING.
[ct=3605.928] THEY BROUGHT A NUMBER OF
[ct=3607.344] EVEN THE BLITZ FROM THE LEFT
[ct=3609.780] FREES UP AND GETS AN OPPORTUNITY
[ct=3611.293] FOR MCDONALD TO GET IN THERE
[ct=3613.922] FREE BECAUSE OF THE BRIDGE OF
[ct=3616.485] THE GAME FROM INSIDE, SO REALLY
[ct=3616.485] GOOD JOB OF CREATING SOME
[ct=3621.442] CONFUSION BY JEFF ALDRICH, WHO
[ct=3622.905] IS THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR AND
[ct=3622.905] CHANGING UP SOME LOOKS.
[ct=3625.860] ADJUSTMENTS.
[ct=3629.639] AL: IF THEY LAUNCH A HAIL MARY,
[ct=3630.968] THE JETS HAVE THREE DEFENDERS AT
[ct=3632.130] THE GOAL LINE.
[ct=3635.940] TRIES TO FIND TIME, LAUNCHES IT
[ct=3641.194] INTO THE ENDZONE, AND A LOT OF
[ct=3641.194] ACTION BACK THERE AND KNOCKED
[ct=3642.619] AWAY.
[ct=3645.174] JONI ADAMS -- TONY
[ct=3650.858] BETTING IT DOWN.
[ct=3655.060] SO THE JETS, 252 YARDS IN THE
[ct=3656.218] FIRST HALF, AND THE PATRIOTS
[ct=3658.484] WERE HELD TO 40.
[ct=3663.630] KAYLEE: THAT LAST DRIVE MIGHT
[ct=3663.630] NOT HAVE ENDED THE WAY HE WANTED
[ct=3664.683] TO, BUT WE HAVE SEEN AARON
[ct=3667.443] RODGERS EFFECTIVE INTERNET OF
[ct=3667.443] THE POCKET.
[ct=3668.768] WHAT IMPRESSED YOU MOST ABOUT
[ct=3669.929] YOUR OFFENSE?
[ct=3672.592] >> WE HAVE BEEN GETTING IN AND
[ct=3673.884] OUT OF THE HUDDLE, GETTING THE
[ct=3676.393] BALL REALLY WELL, RUNNING THIRD
[ct=3676.393] DOWNS.
[ct=3678.930] WE HAVE GOT TO KEEP THAT GOING.
[ct=3681.574] KAYLEE: YOU TOLD US YOU’
[ct=3682.944] KAYLEE: YOU TOLD US YOU'VE
[ct=3684.177] EXPECTED TO GUYS TO STEP UP EVEN
[ct=3685.677] WITH KEY DEFENSIVE INJURIES THAT
[ct=3687.030] YOU WOULD BEEN DOING.
[ct=3688.253] HOW IF THEY BEEN ABLE TO KEEP
[ct=3688.253] BRINGING THE PRESSURE UP FRONT?
[ct=3691.155] >> RELENTLESS.
[ct=3696.107] OUR D-LINE IS DEEP.
[ct=3697.724] WE SET THE STANDARD ON THE
[ct=3697.724] DEFENSIVE LINE
[ct=3698.784] TO KEEP GOING.
[ct=3700.916] AL:FAN, COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF WHA
[ct=3702.280] YOU WOULD HOPE TO SEE.
[ct=3704.881] CONTROL THE CLOCK.
[ct=3707.649] THE GAME GOT AWAY FROM THEM THE
[ct=3708.745] WAY AARON RODGERS HAVE BEEN
[ct=3709.901] PLAYING, SO YOU HAVE GOT TO GET
[ct=3713.034] BACK TO -- YOU LOOK AT THOSE
[ct=3714.429] NUMBERS AND THINK THEY ARE DONE
[ct=3714.429] BY THREE POSSESSIONS.
[ct=3716.752] IF YOU CAN PUT IT DRIVE TOGETHER
[ct=3719.830] HERE, PUT POINTS ON THE BOARD,
[ct=3719.830] YOU ARE RIGHT THERE.
[ct=3721.576] IT IS A MATTER OF ADJUSTING TO
[ct=3724.229] THE PRESSURE THE JETS HAVE
[ct=3726.787] DIALED UP AND GET THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=3728.090] LINE T
[ct=3729.326] THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=3733.389] AL: CAN THEY?
[ct=3734.827] START FROM THE 30.
[ct=3735.658] FIELD.
[ct=3738.608] KAYLEE: THE JETS DEFENSE IS
[ct=3740.852] BROUGHT PRESSURE AGAINST WERE
[ct=3743.802] MAKESHIFT O-LINE.
[ct=3746.561] >> IT IS ALL ABOUT FUNDAMENTALS.
[ct=3749.109] THOSE GUYS HAVE GOT TO PLAY
[ct=3749.109] BETTER.
[ct=3752.935] JUST AS A TEAM, IT GOES BACK TO
[ct=3752.935] FUNDAMENTALS.
[ct=3755.523] KAYLEE: HOW DO YOU
[ct=3758.069] RODGERS OUT OF HIS RHYTHM?
[ct=3762.004] >> DEFENSE HAS BEEN OUT THERE A
[ct=3763.374] LONG TIME.
[ct=3764.526] HE IS PINPOINT RIGHT NOW.
[ct=3766.990] WE JUST HAVE TO SPEND THE DIAL.
[ct=3771.885] AL: WE START FROM THE 30 YARD
[ct=3771.885] LINE.
[ct=3775.999] 19 YARDS, AND NOT A GOOD
[ct=3775.999] BEGINNING FOR THESE GUYS.
[ct=3778.878] MCDONALD'S IS RIGHT THERE
[ct=3778.878] BREAKING THROUGH.
[ct=3781.575] KIRK: THE PROBLEM YOU HAVE IS
[ct=3784.196] WHEN YOU DO NOT HAVE A THREAT
[ct=3785.582] DUNFIELD, THE LINEBACKERS DO NOT
[ct=3786.918] RESPECT ANYTHING, SO THEY ARE
[ct=3788.166] FLYING DOWNHILL.
[ct=3789.304] THERE IS NO FEAR AT ALL.
[ct=3793.248] IT IS SOMETHING NEW ENGLAND WILL
[ct=3793.248] HAVE TO GROW INTO.
[ct=3794.391] MCDONALD DID A GOOD JOB OF
[ct=3795.670] COLLAPSING DOWN TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=3798.296] WATCHING THESE LINEBACKERS.
[ct=3801.230] AROUND?
[ct=3802.700] NO WAY.
[ct=3811.216] AL: THERE IS THE DEFENSIVE ALERT
[ct=3813.547] , IN THE POCKET HE STANDS, AND
[ct=3817.048] THE BALL IS CAUGHT AT THE 36
[ct=3818.555] YARD LINE BY JAILING COAL --
[ct=3825.908] JAYLEN COLT, THIRD DOWN AND 5.
[ct=3833.201] KIRK: RESET -- BRISSETT STANDING
[ct=3833.201] BY TWO ROOKIES.
[ct=3836.968] HE WAS ON THE PRACTICE SQUAD AND
[ct=3838.244] THEY OPEN TO SEIZING AGAIN
[ct=3838.244] CINCINNATI.
[ct=3841.273] HE IS STARTING TO NINE
[ct=3842.566] FIRST CAREER STARTED LEFT
[ct=3842.566] TACKLE.
[ct=3846.121] BIRSSETT IS STANDING IN THEIR
[ct=3847.360] BEING A MAN KNOWING THERE IS
[ct=3847.360] PRESSURE.
[ct=3852.545] AL: HERE COMES THE BLITZ.
[ct=3852.756] IT PASSES INCOMPLETE.
[ct=3854.722] TOO MUCH PRESSURE, AND DOWN HE
[ct=3854.722] GOES.
[ct=3859.937] YOU HAVE GOT BRISSETT GOING
[ct=3862.594] DOWN, THE BACK UP.
[ct=3863.911] HE WILL IN ALL
[ct=3865.243] THERE QUARTERBACK IN THE FUTURE.
[ct=3869.314] KIRK: HERE COMES THE PRESSURE.
[ct=3872.055] AGAINST THIS OFFENSIVE LINE THEY
[ct=3874.654] ARE DIALING UP BECAUSE THERE IS
[ct=3876.080] NO TIME FOR THE RECEIVE
[ct=3877.368] THE SEPARATION ON THAT THIRD
[ct=3877.368] DOWN PLAY.
[ct=3882.488] AL: SO A REAL FAST THREE AND
[ct=3882.488] OUT.
[ct=3890.106] BARINGER'S PUNT, FIELDED,
[ct=3890.995] GIBSON.
[ct=3893.554] 20, 30.
[ct=3897.201] STOPPED AT THE 33 YARD LINE AND
[ct=3899.826] ROGERS -- AARON
[ct=3901.152] RODGERS, THE OLDEST ACTIVE
[ct=3901.152] PLAYER IN THE NFL.
[ct=3903.490] WILL BE 41 IN DECEMBER.
[ct=3905.939] CAN HE LEAD THE JETS TO THE
[ct=3905.939] PROMISED LAND?
[ct=3908.683] OR AT LEAST TO THE WILD-CARD
[ct=3908.683] ROUND.
[ct=3915.058] BACK FROM THE 34 YARD LINE.
[ct=3922.763] GIVE IT TO HIM.
[ct=3926.661] AL: WE WERE DOWN ON THE FIELD
[ct=3927.977] BEFORE THE GAME, KIRK, AND FROM
[ct=3931.883] BEHIND AARON RODGERS, IT IS SO
[ct=3931.883] EASY, IT IS LIKE HE FLICKS THE
[ct=3935.665] REST AND HE GOES.
[ct=3937.064] KIRK: HE DOES.
[ct=3939.648] I TALKED TO HIM A LITTLE BIT
[ct=3941.104] ABOUT HIS TECHNIQUE, AND I SENT
[ct=3942.497] IT IS SO STRANGE.
[ct=3946.104] THE HEEL OF YOUR FOOT NEVER
[ct=3948.999] TOUCHES THE GROUND, AND HE
[ct=3952.946] TALKED ABOUT HOW HE NATURALLY
[ct=3954.332] HAS THIS ABILITY TO BRACE
[ct=3955.828] HIMSELF BUT HIS WHOLE GOAL IS TO
[ct=3957.154] KEEP HIS BODY WEIGHT BACK.
[ct=3959.725] HE DOES THAT IT IS ALMOST LIKE A
[ct=3961.067] KICKSTART, HE PUTS THE LEFTFIELD
[ct=3965.783] DOWN -- THAT'S
[ct=3967.279] THE VELOCITY ON THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=3970.296] AL: INTO THE BACKFIELD, HE
[ct=3972.250] RELEASED A SACK, HE WILL TAKE
[ct=3973.577] OFF, GO TO THE SIDELINE AND FIND
[ct=3977.066] IT, AND THE CYCLE CROSSES THE
[ct=3978.392] BOUNDARY OF KEY ON WHITE.
[ct=3979.765] HE IS FINE.
[ct=3983.269] HE SHAKES HIS HEAD.
[ct=3985.861] KIRK: IT IS FOOTBALL.
[ct=3988.140] I LOVED WHAT HE SAID ABOUT BEING
[ct=3988.364] 40 AND GETTING HIT LIKE THIS.
[ct=3991.481] THERE ARE SOME OF US TO PLAY IN
[ct=3994.075] THE BACKYARD AT 40 WITH OUR
[ct=3995.201] KIDS, AND YOUR LOWER BACK HURTS.
[ct=3997.672] HE SAID TOM USED TO TALK ABOUT
[ct=3997.672] THIS.
[ct=4001.656] AND IT IS NOT A LATE HIT.
[ct=4004.554] HE SAID I'M 40 YEARS OLD, BUT I
[ct=4005.795] HAVE A CHEF, I TAKE CARE OF
[ct=4007.203] MYSELF YEAR-ROUND.
[ct=4008.395] I FEEL BETTER AT 40 THAN
[ct=4009.701] I DID NOT TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.
[ct=4012.320] AL: MUCH LIKE BRADY.
[ct=4017.040] AND HE DRINKS AR EIGHT.
[ct=4018.339] THROUGH THE MIDDLE TO THE 50
[ct=4026.678] KIRK: HE HAS LOOKED GREAT
[ct=4032.102] HE IS COMPLETING PASSES, HE IS
[ct=4032.102] LOOKING OFF DEFENDERS.
[ct=4033.422] HE'S HAD HELP.
[ct=4035.646] THE RECEIVERS ARE RUNNING GOOD
[ct=4038.174] ROUNDS, GUYS ARE MAKING PLAYS
[ct=4038.174] AFTER THE CATCH.
[ct=4039.511] BUT HE’
[ct=4040.886] BUT HE'S USING HIS EYES, WHAT
[ct=4042.218] HERE’
[ct=4045.027] HERE'S A GREAT CHOP READ
[ct=4046.345] HE'S COMING BACK TO THE RIGHT
[ct=4048.978] THE WHOLE TIME, BUT HE MOVES THE
[ct=4050.341] SAFETIES WERE HE WANTS SO HE CAN
[ct=4052.752] CREATE THAT SPACE TO GIVE THEM A
[ct=4054.118] CHANCE TO CATCH THE BALL AND GET
[ct=4054.118] DOWN TO PROTECT HIMSELF.
[ct=4065.030] AL: SECOND DOWN.
[ct=4065.914] HANDOFF.
[ct=4067.118] BRANDON ALLEN.
[ct=4071.095] COMES OFF A LITTLE BIT SHY OF
[ct=4071.095] THE FIRST BY INCHES.
[ct=4073.918] THIRD DOWN COMING UP.
[ct=4076.676] KIRK: HE WAS EXCITED TO BE BACK
[ct=4077.808] HOME, TO USE THAT HARD COUNT.
[ct=4082.873] A LOT OF TIMES HE USES IT, LAST
[ct=4084.556] TIME HE WAS DOWN IN NASHVILLE,
[ct=4088.944] AND NOW BACK HOME, HE TRIED IT A
[ct=4090.003] COUPLE OF TIMES EARLIER ON THE
[ct=4093.207] HARD COUNT, AND LET'S SEE IF HE
[ct=4093.623] TRIES A HERE ON THIRD AND 1.
[ct=4097.585] AL: THERE ARE THREE TIGHT ENDS,
[ct=4100.421] ALLEN IS THE RUNNING BACK.
[ct=4108.905] ON THIRD AND SHORT.
[ct=4110.416] TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=4113.429] AND THAT IS GOING TO BE HOLDING.
[ct=4115.961] INBOUND BY RUCKER.
[ct=4118.392] GOT THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4123.600] KIRK: I JUST LOVE -- I DON'T
[ct=4124.878] EVEN WANT TO TALK, I JUST WANT
[ct=4126.113] TO WATCH THIS.
[ct=4129.253] THIS IS WHY THE JETS FANS WERE
[ct=4130.349] DEVASTATED WHEN HE WENT DOWN ON
[ct=4131.007] THE FOURTH PLAY LAST YEAR.
[ct=4134.983] IT IS ONE THING TO MAKE PLAYS IN
[ct=4136.363] THE POCKET, BUT WHEN HE MAKES
[ct=4137.708] THEM OFF PLATFORM LIKE THIS AND
[ct=4141.715] THROWS AN ABSOLUTE ROPE ON THE
[ct=4142.940] OUTSIDE SHOULDER TO RUCKER,
[ct=4142.940] CREATING LIKE THAT, FEELING
[ct=4144.159] GOOD.
[ct=4144.159] IT IS BEAUTIFUL.
[ct=4159.540] AL: ALAN IS ON THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=4163.346] >> PRIOR TO THE DELAY OF GAME,
[ct=4164.767] FIRST CHARGED TIMEOUT, NEW YORK
[ct=4172.468] THIS WILL BE A 32ND TIMEOUT --
[ct=4173.728] 32ND TIMEOUT.
[ct=4179.085] AL: JETS' FANS KNOW THE HISTORY.
[ct=4180.098] YOU DON'T HAVE TO REPEAT IT.
[ct=4185.584] NO PLAYOFFS FOR 13 YEARS, EIGHT
[ct=4188.283] STRAIGHT LOSING SEASONS.
[ct=4190.878] THE NUMBER ONE GAME IN THE
[ct=4193.472] HISTORY OF THE JETS WAS THE 1968
[ct=4197.348] SEASON, SUPER BOWL THREE, A L
[ct=4198.543] TIME AGO.UPER BOWL THREE, A LONG
[ct=4202.615] KIRK: AND IT IS WEEK THREE.
[ct=4203.713] WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET CRAZY
[ct=4205.345] HERE, BUT YOU WATCH A LOT OF
[ct=4206.777] FOOTBALL, IT IS A YEAR WHERE
[ct=4208.244] OFFENSES ARE STRUGGLING,
[ct=4209.465] NOT SEEN THE NUMBERS WE NORMALLY
[ct=4209.465] SEE.
[ct=4212.172] YOU ARE JUST GOING TO KNOCK ON
[ct=4213.422] WOOD AND HOPE A
[ct=4214.831] ABLE TO STAY HEALTHY.
[ct=4217.358] HE STARTING TO SEE THE PIECES
[ct=4217.358] AROUND HIM.
[ct=4221.502] THE OFFENSIVE LINE WILL ONLY GET
[ct=4221.502] BETTER WITH THREE NEW PIECES.
[ct=4225.235] WILSON ON THE OUTSIDE, LAZARD,
[ct=4228.999] MIKE WILLIAMS, BREECE HALL,
[ct=4230.406] THERE IS A LOT TO THIS OFFENSE.
[ct=4234.174] AL: AND HERE IS THE ROOKIE ALLEN
[ct=4236.086] TO THE 38TH YARD LINE.
[ct=4238.784] THE LAST TIME THE JETS GOT TO
[ct=4240.107] THE PLAYOFFS, THEY GOT TO THE
[ct=4241.473] AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME TWO YEARS
[ct=4244.133] IN A ROW.
[ct=4253.014] BUT HE RYAN -- >> RYAN -- RYAN,
[ct=4255.597] BUT HE IS POPULAR, AND
[ct=4257.096] THAT'S THE LAST TIME THEY GOT TO
[ct=4258.152] THE PLAYOFFS.
[ct=4260.764] KIRK: WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF
[ct=4264.623] BRAELON ALLEN, MISSED PLAYS,
[ct=4267.711] COUPLE OF TOUCHDOWNS, SEEING HIM
[ct=4268.965] MORE TONIGHT.
[ct=4270.022] LOVE WHAT AARON RODGERS SAID
[ct=4270.022] ABOUT HIM.
[ct=4271.247] WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT AFTER
[ct=4271.247] THIS PLAY.
[ct=4274.210] AL: SECOND AND 7.
[ct=4276.591] GOOD FAKE.
[ct=4276.591] PRESSURE IS ON.
[ct=4278.063] THROWS UNDERNEATH.
[ct=4287.071] CHECKS IT DOWN TO ALLEN,
[ct=4287.071] THIRD DOWN AND 3.
[ct=4289.876] KIRK: YOU HAVE THE
[ct=4291.332] YOUNGEST PLAYERS IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=4293.789] WE TALKED ABOUT HIM AT A BEFORE,
[ct=4295.330] AND HE SAID, I KNEW ABOUT HIM
[ct=4298.159] WHEN HE WAS A FRESHMAN AT THE
[ct=4298.159] UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN.
[ct=4300.546] I WAS A BIG FAN, AND WE ENDED UP
[ct=4302.166] DRAFTING HIM.
[ct=4303.732] HE SAID WHAT HE REALLY LOVES
[ct=4304.290] ABOUT HIM AS HE SITS IN FRONT OF
[ct=4306.781] HIM AT THE MEETINGS, TAKING
[ct=4310.299] NOTES, AND HE'S VERY MATURE FOR
[ct=4311.590] A GUY AS YOUNG AS HE IS AT 20
[ct=4311.590] YEARS OLD.
[ct=4314.261] HE HAS BEEN BLOWN AWAY BY THE
[ct=4316.970] WANT INSIDE OF HIM.
[ct=4317.704] HE IS NOT SURPRISED HE'S PLAYING
[ct=4319.927] AL: ALLEN GREW UP WATCHING HIM.
[ct=4324.261] AARON RODGERS KEEPS HIS EYES
[ct=4326.403] DOWNFIELD, FIRES, FINDS THE MAN.
[ct=4330.475] THIS TIME IT IS THE TIGHT END,
[ct=4332.956] EXTENDS THE PLAY, ON THE MOVE,
[ct=4333.126] THROWING ON THE MONEY.
[ct=4336.404] KIRK: HOW MANY PLAYS HAS HE MADE
[ct=4336.808] TONIGHT ON THE RUN?
[ct=4338.616] WATCH THE RIGHT TACKLE HELP HIM.
[ct=4339.996] MORGAN MOSES.
[ct=4345.122] AARON RODGERS STEPS UP AND THEN
[ct=4347.674] MOSES PINS THAT PRESSURE AND NOW
[ct=4350.530] HE BREAKS OUTSIDE WITH THE
[ct=4351.132] ABILITY TO WAIT AND FIND THAT
[ct=4354.702] OPEN RECEIVER, AND HE IS AS
[ct=4356.092] DANGEROUS AS ANYBODY OUT THERE
[ct=4357.029] BECAUSE OF HOW QUICK THAT BALL
[ct=4359.592] GETS OUT AND HOW ACCURATE HE
[ct=4360.502] THROWS ON THE RUN, AND HE LOOKS
[ct=4361.467] GOOD IN THE HAT.
[ct=4363.315] AL: AS GOOD AS EVER.
[ct=4366.903] HIS LAST YEAR AT GREEN BAY WAS
[ct=4366.903] NOT THAT GOOD.
[ct=4369.850] HE HAD GONE ALL OF LAST YEAR
[ct=4371.162] EXCEPT FOR FOUR PLAYS.
[ct=4372.784] TONIGHT, BACK TO THE FUTURE.
[ct=4378.043] S HAD TO TAKE A SECOND
[ct=4381.368] TIMEOUT TO AVOID THE DELAY OF
[ct=4384.355] COULD BE SIGNIFICANT DOWN THE
[ct=4385.670] STRETCH OF THIS GAME GETS CLOSE
[ct=4388.517] OR CLOSER.
[ct=4389.732] 16 YARD LINE.
[ct=4392.543] QUARTER.
[ct=4393.545] RODGERS TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=4397.823] AND TACKLED AT THE 10 YARD LINE.
[ct=4400.624] KIRK: LAST WEEK, THEY GO TO THAT
[ct=4404.122] SAME FORMATION, PUT BREECE HALL
[ct=4406.551] OUT THERE, WALKED OUT, MADE A
[ct=4409.050] PLEA, THIS TIME WITH SOFT
[ct=4409.050] COVERAGE FROM ANOTHER
[ct=4409.534] LINEBACKER.
[ct=4416.151] RUNNING THE FOOTBALL TO GET SIX,
[ct=4418.685] INSTEAD, LET'S RUN IT TO BREECE
[ct=4418.685] HALL, GET SOME POSITIVE YARDS.
[ct=4422.635] THAT PACKAGE WILL B
[ct=4423.850] TEAMS HAVE TO DEFEND EVERY WEEK
[ct=4426.407] WITH RODGERS ABILITY TO FIND
[ct=4426.407] CATCH UP.
[ct=4430.634] AL: SECOND AND 4, TO THE
[ct=4430.634] OUTSIDE.
[ct=4431.971] GOOD MOVE.
[ct=4431.971] TACKLED AT THE TWO.
[ct=4435.189] GARRETT WILSON TAKEN DOWN BY
[ct=4435.568] JONES TO SAVE THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=4437.088] FIRST AND GOAL.
[ct=4439.785] KIRK: YOU THINK ABOUT HIM WITH
[ct=4442.348] HIS BODY CONTROL DOWNFIELD
[ct=4444.389] TAKING PLACE, BUT WITH SOFT
[ct=4446.172] COVERAGE LIKE THAT, GETTING IT
[ct=4449.057] TO HIM IN A HURRY, HE IS JUST AS
[ct=4449.057] DANGEROUS AFTER THE CATCH.
[ct=4450.447] WE HAVE SEEN THAT THEME
[ct=4452.235] REPEATING.
[ct=4454.452] THE NEW YORK JETS RECEIVERS
[ct=4455.637] TAKING PLACE WITH ACCURATE
[ct=4456.422] THROWS FROM AARON RODGERS AND HE
[ct=4460.750] HAS GOT LIVE LEGS,
[ct=4461.672] TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=4466.083] AL: CHRISTIAN GONZALEZ, FIRST
[ct=4466.083] AND GOAL.
[ct=4473.230] RODGERS, A THROW, CAUGHT,
[ct=4474.034] STAYING INBOUND.
[ct=4474.034] YES, TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=4486.421] KIRK: THERE IS GARRETT WILSON'S
[ct=4487.043] FIRST TOUCHDOWN
[ct=4490.045] WE WILL BE SEEING A LOT OF THAT.
[ct=4492.703] EIGHT TO FIVE.
[ct=4492.703] HOW ABOUT THIS THROW?
[ct=4496.703] GONZALEZ ROLLS THE DICE, INKING
[ct=4497.839] ABOUT GETTING HIS TEAM BACK IN
[ct=4497.839] THE GAME.
[ct=4499.363] JUMPSUIT.
[ct=4502.399] IF HE DOES, HE MAYBE HAS A
[ct=4504.771] CHANCE, BUT THAT BALL IS ABOUT
[ct=4506.239] TO BE A BROKEN RECORD.
[ct=4509.150] PERFECTLY THROWN TO THE OUTSIDE,
[ct=4510.118] AWAY FROM THE DEFENDER AND THERE
[ct=4511.205] IS THAT BODY CONTROL
[ct=4512.782] TALKED ABOUT WITH GARRETT
[ct=4519.551] AL: THE POINT AFTER IS GOOD, SO
[ct=4524.267] AFTER THE PASS, THE JETS GO
[ct=4529.478] DOWNFIELD, 66 YARDS, THEY LEAD
[ct=4529.478] BY 18.
[ct=4534.755] -- HON
[ct=4538.618] -- HOYUNDAI.
[ct=4542.669] RUN FOR 16 YARDS, ERIC WILSON
[ct=4545.353] JUST MADE THAT TOUCHDOWN GRAB.
[ct=4549.243] 25 YARDS ON FOUR CATCHES.
[ct=4555.133] THREE POINTS, 46 TOTAL YARDS FOR
[ct=4555.483] THE PATS OFFENSE, AND THE JETS
[ct=4558.178] HAVE GAINED THE HUNDRED 18 YARDS
[ct=4559.645] TO 46 FOR NEW ENGLAND.
[ct=4562.113] 21-3 IS THE SCORE.
[ct=4568.802] AND THE KICK OFF.
[ct=4576.206] SO, FOR THE PATRIOTS,.
[ct=4581.598] MAYO WAS A TOP 10 PICK BACK WHEN
[ct=4582.590] HE CAME OUT OF COLLEGE.
[ct=4584.447] YOU HAVE SEEN HIM A LOT.
[ct=4585.790] YOUR TAKE ON MAY?
[ct=4588.133] KIRK: HE'S GOT A BRIGHT FUTURE.
[ct=4590.786] I LOVE THE FACT THAT HE'S HAD A
[ct=4593.149] CHANCE TO SIT AFTER GETTING
[ct=4593.149] THROWN INTO THE FIRE.
[ct=4595.795] WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF YOUNG
[ct=4597.210] QUARTERBACKS, ESPECIALLY THIS
[ct=4597.210] YEAR --
[ct=4599.858] AL: GETTING OPEN THAT TIME IS
[ct=4600.828] DOUGLAS.
[ct=4603.652] I'M AERIAL DOUGLAS.
[ct=4604.760] PRESSURE PUT UP BY JAELON
[ct=4607.254] HUNG IN THERE.
[ct=4609.813] KIRK: A GOOD TOP BY THE ROOKIE,
[ct=4611.164] LEFT TACKLE.
[ct=4615.261] JUST GETS THAT BALL OFF.
[ct=4616.575] THERE IS THE SEPARATION.
[ct=4622.077] IT IS GOOD TO SEE DOUGLAS GET A
[ct=4622.077] CHANCE TO GET HIS HANDS ON A
[ct=4624.771] FOOTBALL, ONE OF THE MOR
[ct=4627.619] ELECTRIFYING THREATS THEY HAVE
[ct=4627.619] ON THE PERIMETER.
[ct=4637.447] AL: ACTION AND PRESSURE AGAIN.
[ct=4638.574] SETS UP THE SCREEN.
[ct=4642.257] LOOPER, THE TIGHT END RUMBLES
[ct=4644.192] ALL THE WAY INSIDE
[ct=4645.607] 29 YARD LINE.
[ct=4648.181] KIRK: IT IS GOOD TO SEE THAT
[ct=4649.179] SCREEN.
[ct=4650.651] IT IS A GREAT ANSWER TO
[ct=4653.490] ONE LAST THING ON DRAKE
[ct=4654.642] ANYBODY WHO HAS WATCHED HIM
[ct=4658.511] PLAY, HE HAS THAT IT FACTOR,
[ct=4661.360] ATHLETIC FAMILY, DAD PLAYED IN
[ct=4661.360] COLLEGE,
[ct=4662.820] CHAMPIONSHIP IN NORTH CAROLINA,
[ct=4666.577] A GREAT TEAMMATE, AND A GUY WHO
[ct=4666.577] UNDERSTANDS HIS ROLE RIGHT NOW.
[ct=4669.198] YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE
[ct=4670.503] QUARTERBACKS WHO HAD TO SIT BACK
[ct=4671.871] AND WAIT, AARON
[ct=4672.992] LOVE.
[ct=4675.848] AL: RODGERS KNOWS THAT ALL TOO
[ct=4678.547] WELL, THREE YEARS.
[ct=4681.300] MEANWHILE, THAT BALL IS CAUGHT
[ct=4684.673] AT THE 25.
[ct=4690.046] KAYLEE: DRAKE WAS RUNNING A
[ct=4690.046] SCOUT TEAM IN PRACTICE,
[ct=4692.865] PRACTICING, ANDREWS TOLD ME THAT
[ct=4695.559] HE SAW A ROOKIE AND BRACING HIS
[ct=4697.875] ROLE IN ASKING
[ct=4699.238] RIGHT QUESTIONS PER HE
[ct=4700.586] APPRECIATES THE EFFORT HE PUT
[ct=4702.873] IN, SPECIFICALLY HOW HE LEARNED
[ct=4704.298] THE FIELD.
[ct=4705.674] AL: THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=4710.972] INTENDED THAT TIME FOR THORTON.
[ct=4714.724] THE INTERESTING THING IS MOST
[ct=4716.164] QUARTERBACKS, THE NUMBER ONE GUY
[ct=4718.723] WILL GET 90, 95% OF THE SNAPS,
[ct=4721.144] THE OTHER GUY, FIVE OR 10.
[ct=4725.048] THEY GO 70 30, BUT MAY HAS SEEN
[ct=4726.157] 30%.
[ct=4727.732] KIRK: THAT IS THE WAY THAT THEY
[ct=4729.036] FEEL THAT THEY WILL ALLOW HIM TO
[ct=4731.571] DEVELOP, AND HE'S ALSO GETTING
[ct=4734.017] THOSE LIVE REPS AGAINST
[ct=4734.017] FIRST-TEAM DEFENSE.
[ct=4735.566] SO THAT ALSO HELPS THEM.
[ct=4738.024] A BIG THIRD DOWN HERE FOR THIS
[ct=4743.292] AL: A GOOD START TO THE DRIVE.
[ct=4748.359] HE PULLS IT DOWN, FIRING, AND
[ct=4748.359] THAT IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=4752.470] HE HAD A FLAG DOWN HERE AS
[ct=4755.295] DEMARIO DOUGLAS WAS THE INTENDED
[ct=4755.295] RECEIVER.
[ct=4759.059] THERE'S ALSO A FLAG IN THE
[ct=4761.646] OFFENSIVE ACT FIELD, SO YOU HAVE
[ct=4764.207] ONE IN THE SECONDARY AND ONE IN
[ct=4765.444] THE OFFENSIVE BACKFIELD.
[ct=4774.591] >> THERE ARE TWO VOWELS ON THE
[ct=4774.591] PLAY, ONE BY EACH TEAM.
[ct=4778.718] HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER 60.
[ct=4781.291] PASS INTERFERENCE, DEFENSE,
[ct=4782.769] NUMBER 30.
[ct=4785.365] WE PLAY, THIRD DOWN.
[ct=4787.879] AL: ANDREWS ON ONE SIDE, CARTER
[ct=4789.228] ON THE OTHER.
[ct=4790.631] BACK WHERE
[ct=4791.977] THERE DOWN.
[ct=4796.001] KIRK: WILLIAMS COMES RIGHT OVER
[ct=4797.242] THE MIDDLE OF THIS OFFENSE, A
[ct=4798.752] GOOD MATCHUP.
[ct=4801.446] THAT IS A TOUGH ASK FOR ANDREWS.
[ct=4802.673] A GREAT PLAYER WHO HAS BEEN
[ct=4802.673] AROUND A LONG TIME.
[ct=4807.675] THAT TIME, A HOLDING CALL, HE
[ct=4807.675] GIVES INTO THE POWER.
[ct=4811.173] I DID NOT SEE ANY INTERFERENCE
[ct=4811.173] AT ALL.
[ct=4815.398] AL: BACK TO A THIRD AND 4.
[ct=4820.446] ROLLING, LAST TIME, HERE GOES
[ct=4821.770] ANOTHER FLAG.
[ct=4823.105] YOU KNOW WHAT THAT NORMALLY
[ct=4823.105] MEANS.
[ct=4827.354] YOU SEE THAT KIND OF A FLAG, IT
[ct=4830.180] IS ALWAYS OFFENSIVE HOLDING.
[ct=4831.715] KIRK: LEFT TACKLE HERE.
[ct=4841.890] >> HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER 70.
[ct=4842.144] THIRD DOWN.
[ct=4851.349] KIRK: FOR PEOPLE JUST TUNING IN,
[ct=4851.349] HE'S MAKING HIS FIRST CAREER
[ct=4853.909] START AGAINST THIS DEFENSE AND
[ct=4855.266] DOING OK, THAT TIME ON A BIG
[ct=4860.312] HE ENDS UP GETTING BEAT TO
[ct=4861.710] THE INSIDE, USING THAT RIGHT
[ct=4862.921] HAND TO THROW THE DEFENDER DOWN.
[ct=4866.895] THIS GUY HAD 40 CAREER STARTS IN
[ct=4868.762] COLLEGE AT PENN STATE READ THE
[ct=4870.036] TIME PROGRAM, GREAT PLAYER,
[ct=4872.807] NEVER PLAYED LEFT TACKLE, AND
[ct=4874.189] HERE HE IS MAKING HIS START
[ct=4876.638] TONIGHT, NFL, FIRST CAREER START
[ct=4878.102] ON THE LEFT SIDE.
[ct=4880.860] AL: FOUR MEN RUSH HERE.
[ct=4885.698] DOWN HE GOES, THE FLAG GOES
[ct=4885.698] DOWN.
[ct=4891.980] WILLIAMS GOT TO HIM, SLOAN NEEDS
[ct=4893.324] ASSISTANCE IN GETTING UP.
[ct=4903.691] AND A PENALTY TO BOOTH.
[ct=4910.521] THAT PENALTY IS DECLINED.
[ct=4911.884] FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=4914.347] AL: A DOUBLE.
[ct=4917.026] KIRK: THEY DON'T NECESSARILY
[ct=4919.668] HAVE TO BRING THE BLITZ, BUT
[ct=4921.334] THEY DO A NICE STUNT HERE WITH
[ct=4923.155] THE BIG MAN BRINGING HIM AROUND,
[ct=4924.576] TRYING TO CONFUSE THAT OFFENSIVE
[ct=4927.453] NOBODY PICKS HIM UP.
[ct=4934.238] AL: WILLIAMS WILL GET A SACK,
[ct=4935.158] AND HE WILL GET SENT DOWN.
[ct=4938.216] DOWN BY CONTACT.
[ct=4943.178] THAT MAKES IT FOURTH DOWN AND A
[ct=4948.603] INSTEAD OF GETTING A POTENTIAL
[ct=4951.736] FIELD GOAL RANGE, NOTHING DOING
[ct=4952.342] ON THAT COUNT RIGHT NOW.
[ct=4959.556] BEHRINGER WITH HIS FOURTH PUNT
[ct=4959.814] OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=4969.321] FOURTH AND 26.
[ct=4973.484] KIRK: THREE PLUS SACKS NOW IN
[ct=4976.407] EACH OF THEIR FIRST FOUR GAMES,
[ct=4979.497] THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1985, THE
[ct=4980.248] NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE ERA.
[ct=4989.950] AL: TAKEN AT THE
[ct=4998.092] KIRK: LET'S LOOK AT OUR STATS,
[ct=5000.804] POWERED BY AWS, AARON RODGERS,
[ct=5000.804] WE'VE SEEN HIM SITTING IN THE
[ct=5003.329] POCKET, MANIPULATING, LOOKING
[ct=5005.186] WITH HIS EYES, BUT IT HAS BEEN
[ct=5006.648] SO GREAT TO SEE HIM BACK ON THE
[ct=5007.701] FIELD TONIGHT.
[ct=5015.101] MOVING AROUND, FIVE FOR FIVE,
[ct=5016.403] JUST ON FIRE AND FEELING GOOD IN
[ct=5019.472] THIS OFFENSE, THAT I THINK WE
[ct=5021.650] ARE STARTING TO SEE MORE WEAPONS
[ct=5025.818] STARTING TO COME UP TONIGHT AND
[ct=5025.989] WITH WHAT THIS OFFENSE IS
[ct=5026.611] CAPABLE OF DOING.
[ct=5029.327] AL: AARON RODGERS, FOUR TIMES
[ct=5031.125] THE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER.
[ct=5034.023] MOST RECENTLY IN 2021.
[ct=5038.987] STARTING FROM THE 12 YARD LINE.
[ct=5042.073] ALLEN.
[ct=5043.975] BUNCHED UP AT THE LINE OF
[ct=5047.599] KIRK: HOW GREAT IS THAT, HIS
[ct=5051.474] FIRST HOME GAME BACK, UP 21-3
[ct=5052.531] AND THE AARON RODGERS CHANCE
[ct=5053.117] THAT BEGAN HERE AT METLIFE.
[ct=5055.352] PRETTY COOL AFTER HOW HARD HE
[ct=5058.300] WORKED TO GET BACK, PUT HIMSELF
[ct=5061.316] IN A POSITION TO PLAY FOR THE
[ct=5061.761] JETS, 40 YEARS OLD
[ct=5065.173] . AL: HE'S HAD A LOT OF GAMES
[ct=5065.173] WITH THE JETS HERE.
[ct=5067.870] THE LOUDEST CROWD I EVER HEARD
[ct=5070.542] AT THE BEGINNING, THEY WERE
[ct=5073.201] AMPED UP, AS THEY WERE LAST YEAR
[ct=5078.495] ON OPENING NIGHT, THAT LASTED
[ct=5081.129] ABOUT FOUR MINUTES.
[ct=5081.129] SECOND AND NONE.
[ct=5084.968] FLICKS IT.
[ct=5086.347] CAUGHT.
[ct=5089.066] ALLEN BREAKS THE TACKLE.
[ct=5091.640] AND THE ROOKIE TAKES IT OUT TO
[ct=5091.640] THE 20 YARD LINE.
[ct=5096.050] KIRK: YOU BETTER COME IN AND GET
[ct=5100.240] LOW WHEN IT COMES TO SUPPORT
[ct=5100.240] WITH BRAELON ALLEN.
[ct=5104.360] GET 235 POUNDS, WE SAW HIM DO
[ct=5105.551] THIS A LOT IN COLLEGE.
[ct=5109.124] THIS TIME IT LOWERS THAT
[ct=5110.312] SHOULDER.
[ct=5113.146] PRETTY GOOD EFFORT TO KEEP HIM
[ct=5114.550] SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN MARKER.
[ct=5121.331] AL: TWO-POINT QUOTE -- 2:30 LEFT
[ct=5122.397] IN THE THIRD.
[ct=5125.195] JETS TRY TO GO TO TWO AND 1.
[ct=5127.801] AFTER AN UPSET WIN AND
[ct=5128.966] CINCINNATI, THERE WAS A
[ct=5130.315] SEATTLE.
[ct=5134.040] RODGERS ON THIRD AND 2.
[ct=5135.220] LOOKING DOWNFIELD.
[ct=5139.281] FIRES, CAUGHT, OPEN, 41 YARD
[ct=5140.428] TACKLED.
[ct=5144.793] KIRK: A ROUGHING
[ct=5147.081] PLAY.
[ct=5149.999] AL: YOU HAVE GOT TWO FLAGS.
[ct=5152.535] ONE RIGHT AT THE LINE OF
[ct=5154.986] SCRIMMAGE, THE OTHER ALL THE W
[ct=5156.362] BACK.
[ct=5156.362] SOMETHING IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=5160.857] SO YOU MIGHT HAVE TWO SEPARATE
[ct=5160.857] GOALS HERE.
[ct=5165.109] SO THERE IS YOUR ROUGHING.
[ct=5177.054] AND THEN A PENALTY AT THE LINE
[ct=5181.357] KIRK: SIMPSON M
[ct=5181.659] THE LEFT GUARD.
[ct=5184.082] >> THERE IS NO FOUL.
[ct=5191.507] HEY MEMBER OF THE OFFENSE DEALT
[ct=5194.466] LEGALLY, THERE IS A FOUL,
[ct=5196.377] UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS, THE 15
[ct=5198.611] YARD PENALTY WILL BE ADDED AT
[ct=5199.000] THE END, AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5204.959] KIRK: YOU KNOW WHO IS REALLY
[ct=5205.619] PUTTING TOGETHER A NIGHT?
[ct=5206.286] CONKLIN.
[ct=5210.122] WHEN HE SCRAMBLES, THERE'S A BIG
[ct=5212.975] HIT, OFFICIAL RIGHT THERE MAKES
[ct=5214.313] THE CALL, BUT WHAT MAKES IT
[ct=5216.814] TOUGH WHEN HE GETS OUT HIS HE
[ct=5216.814] THROWS LASERS.
[ct=5220.045] HE DOES NOT EASE THE BALL IN, HE
[ct=5222.816] MAKES UP HIS MIND AND YOU JUST
[ct=5223.190] DON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO REACT AS
[ct=5225.885] A DEFENSE WHEN HE GETS OUTSIDE
[ct=5228.670] OF THE POCKET, AND ONCE HE MAKES
[ct=5228.670] UP HIS MIND TO FIND OPEN
[ct=5231.045] RECEIVER, THESE GUYS ARE DOING A
[ct=5234.315] GOOD JOB OF SCRAMBLING.
[ct=5235.790] THAT TIME, CONKLIN DOES A GOOD
[ct=5237.819] JOB, EIGHT RECEPTION
[ct=5239.374] ON THE NIGHT.
[ct=5243.645] AL: AS THEY DO IN EVERY SPORT,
[ct=5245.058] CHANTING HIS NAME, AARONRODGERS.
[ct=5247.917] COUPLE OF PRETTY GOOD ERRANDS
[ct=5249.391] PLAY RIGHT NOW IN NEW YORK
[ct=5253.989] --AARON'S PLAY RIGHT NOW IN NEW
[ct=5253.989] YORK.
[ct=5255.129] THAT IS CAUGHT.
[ct=5258.240] HE HAS BEEN THEIR LEADING
[ct=5258.522] RECEIVER TONIGHT.
[ct=5262.394] TARGETED SIX TIMES, CAUGHT
[ct=5263.709] 94 YARDS.
[ct=5266.245] KIRK: THAT TIME, THE DEFENSE SAT
[ct=5268.967] BACK IN COVERAGE, TRYING TO TAKE
[ct=5270.306] DOWN THE SHOTS, AND WAS LOOKING
[ct=5271.752] DOWNFIELD TO THE POTENTIAL OF
[ct=5274.285] GETTING IT TO MIKE WILLIAMS AND
[ct=5275.579] ACROSS TO ERIC WILSON.
[ct=5278.483] EVERY THING IS TAKEN AWAY, SO HE
[ct=5278.483] CHECKS IT DOWN AND MAKES A
[ct=5279.657] DECISION.
[ct=5283.344] AL: CONKLIN GOING SIX PASSES ALL
[ct=5283.344] OF LAST SEASON.
[ct=5295.915] TO THE 30 YARD LINE -- SORRY, HE
[ct=5297.409] HOOKED 61.
[ct=5298.620] HE DID NOT SCORE A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=5304.234] ONLY SHORT SHIFTED HIM BY 55.
[ct=5306.696] KIRK: IT FELT LIKE THAT BECAUSE
[ct=5308.360] THAT IS THE ONE POSITION THAT I
[ct=5310.699] THINK PEOPLE WERE EXCITED TO SEE
[ct=5313.817] THE POTENTIAL OF THE GROWTH WITH
[ct=5313.817] AARON RODGERS BACK THERE.
[ct=5317.323] AGAIN, YOU KNOW ABOUT SOME OF
[ct=5319.980] THE OTHER WEAPONS, BUT IF YOU
[ct=5321.363] GET CONKLIN GOING AND JEREMY.
[ct=5324.155] AL: TWO BACKS.
[ct=5325.476] KIRK: AND MIKE WILLIAMS, LAZARD.
[ct=5328.487] AL: THOSE TWO BACKS ARE HERE
[ct=5332.408] RIGHT NOW, ALLEN AND HOWELL.
[ct=5335.123] FIRES BEHIND THE INTENDED
[ct=5335.123] TARGET.
[ct=5336.515] ERIC WILSON.
[ct=5341.434] AND ONE MORE PIECE OF LAUNDRY.
[ct=5347.297] KIRK: A GOOD SHOT THEREBY
[ct=5347.864] SIMPSON.
[ct=5350.825] IT'S LIKE TRYING TO BE
[ct=5350.825] AGGRESSIVE.
[ct=5355.556] THEY HAVE GOT HIM --
[ct=5359.551] >> AFTER THE PLAY WAS OVER,
[ct=5361.044] UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS, OFFENSE,
[ct=5365.183] NUMBER 76, THE 15 YARD PENALTY
[ct=5365.183] WILL BE ON THE PREVIOUS FIVE.
[ct=5370.208] KIRK: THE BALL WAS AWAY, THE
[ct=5374.772] PRESSURE UP TO THE TOP ON TYRON
[ct=5374.772] SMITH.
[ct=5377.714] HE'S DOING HIS JOB, AND YOU SEE
[ct=5380.178] SIMPSON, HE GOES ON TOP OF HIM.
[ct=5382.959] ONCE HE JUMPED ON TOP OF HIM IS
[ct=5384.295] WHERE THE PENALTY CAME IN.
[ct=5385.707] HE IS AGGRESSIVE.
[ct=5387.689] IT IS NOT GREAT THAT HE IS DOING
[ct=5388.808] THIS, BUT I DON'T MIND THE
[ct=5388.808] ENERGY.
[ct=5394.463] AL: THE OFFENSIVE LINE DOING THE
[ct=5394.463] JOB.
[ct=5397.500] OF COURSE, NUMBER ONE SURE,
[ct=5399.423] PROTECT NUMBER EIGHT AT ALL
[ct=5401.315] COSTS.
[ct=5403.562] SECOND AND 25.
[ct=5407.686] LOOK OUT.
[ct=5410.231] THEY DID NOT PROTECT HIM THAT
[ct=5412.704] NOW HE GOES TO THE 45 YARD LINE.
[ct=5415.160] BOUCHER COMING IN FOR THE
[ct=5421.946] SACKED, AND AN INJURED JET RIGHT
[ct=5422.991] NOW, STOPPING THE CLOCK AT FIVE
[ct=5422.991] SECONDS.
[ct=5427.173] YOU HAVE MORGAN ROSES -- MORGAN
[ct=5429.453] MOSES, CAME OVER IN A TRADE WITH
[ct=5431.159] THE RAVENS, THE RIGHT TACKLE,
[ct=5433.867] VETERAN AND IN HIS 11TH SEASON.
[ct=5436.565] RIGHT NOW, HE'S IN AGONY.
[ct=5438.447] KIRK: IT IS EVERY
[ct=5439.061] LINEMAN'S WORST FEAR, YOU GET
[ct=5441.296] PUSHED INTO THE BACK FIELD AND
[ct=5442.957] YOU GET ROLLED UP ON.
[ct=5446.629] COMING FROM BEHIND HIM AS HE IS
[ct=5446.629] JUST TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING HE
[ct=5447.570] CAN.
[ct=5452.802] HIS REACTION TELLS US MORE THAN
[ct=5454.039] ANYTHING.
[ct=5457.972] AL: HE'S CAUGHT, AND THERE’S
[ct=5457.972] NOWHERE TO GO.
[ct=5460.564] GREAT TO SEE MOSES GET UP.
[ct=5463.342] HE WAS WRITHING IN PAIN AND
[ct=5467.312] AGONY, HE HOBBLED OFF.
[ct=5468.893] HE'S BEEN A REAL IRONMAN
[ct=5470.263] HIS CAREER.
[ct=5471.297] HE'S ONLY MISSED THREE GAMES IN
[ct=5477.864] 11 SEASONS, 2023, PENN STATE, HE
[ct=5481.858] WILL COME IN WHEN WE START THE
[ct=5481.858] FOURTH QUARTER.
[ct=5484.495] WE SHOULD BE WINDING THE CLOCK
[ct=5487.152] HERE IN THE SECOND, TAKING AWAY
[ct=5488.473] THE WANING SECONDS OF THE THIRD
[ct=5493.711] KIRK: SO HE COMES IN TO PLAY
[ct=5493.711] RIGHT TACKLE.
[ct=5496.366] HE PLA
[ct=5497.653] COLLEGE.
[ct=5500.196] AL: ALL OVER THE PLACE, THESE
[ct=5500.196] GUYS.
[ct=5506.035] JETS ON TOP 21-3, BUT THEY ARE
[ct=5509.085] FACING THIRD AND 33 FROM THEIR
[ct=5509.085] OWN 46 YARD LINE.
[ct=5513.635] RODGERS SELLS FOR A LITTLE SWING
[ct=5517.942] PASS, JUST ACROSS THE 50, XAVIER
[ct=5518.828] GIPSON MAKING THE CATCH.
[ct=5525.154] FOR ARID -- HER RODGERS, 200 --
[ct=5529.459] FOR RODGERS, 257 YARDS, RUN FOR
[ct=5531.462] 16 YARDS, LOOKS GREAT OUT OF THE
[ct=5537.171] KIRK: IT IS ONE THING TO WONDER
[ct=5539.670] HOW HE IS GOING TO PERFORM WITH
[ct=5540.920] HIS MIND.
[ct=5540.920] WE ALL KNOW THAT.
[ct=5543.403] BUT THE THING THAT HAS BEEN
[ct=5545.025] GREAT NEWS WE HAVE SEEN
[ct=5546.501] BALL COME OUT OF HIS HAND THE
[ct=5547.469] WAY IT USED TO.
[ct=5549.974] THE VELOCITY IN THAT SPAN HAS
[ct=5551.787] BEEN AMAZING, AND THE ACCURACY.
[ct=5554.926] AL: FIELDED AT THE 12 YARD LINE
[ct=5556.270] HERE.
[ct=5560.264] MARCUS JONES.
[ct=5566.816] PLAYING -- FLAG ON THIS PLAY,
[ct=5571.106] BACK AT THE 45 YARD LINE.
[ct=5578.788] PERSONAL FOUL.

[ct=5587.034] TO NUMBER 19, THE 15 YARD
[ct=5587.034] PENALTY WILL BE ENFORCED FROM
[ct=5588.378] THE END OF THE
[ct=5592.558] AL: CHARLES HAS BEEN A SPECIAL
[ct=5593.668] TEAMS HAVEN TO THESE GUYS.
[ct=5595.882] MOSES, AT LEAST ABLE TO WALK
[ct=5598.968] UNDER HIS OWN POWER, BACK TO THE
[ct=5598.968] LOCKER ROOM.
[ct=5603.322] KIRK: RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE LEAD
[ct=5604.056] REFEREE.
[ct=5608.341] LIKE THE GUY IN THE WHITE HAT,
[ct=5611.278] YOU DO NOT WANT TO MESS AROUND.
[ct=5613.980] AL: TOTALLY.
[ct=5616.735] SURREPTITIOUS.
[ct=5620.601] I MEAN, PENALTIES, OVE
[ct=5621.817] YARDS.
[ct=5624.088] KIRK: ABOUT THE ONLY THING YOU
[ct=5625.439] CAN SAY THAT HAS NOT BEEN CLEAN
[ct=5626.683] FOR HIM TONIGHT.
[ct=5636.510] AL: FROM THE 31-YARD LINE, PASS
[ct=5642.933] 28 RUSHING YARDS, 8:53 PASSING
[ct=5649.639] TOUGH NIGHT FOR PERCENT -- TOUGH
[ct=5655.020] NIGHT FOR MORE STEAD -- MORSTA
[ct=5656.276] EAD.
[ct=5660.448] AND MORE ACTION HERE.
[ct=5662.952] MESH.
[ct=5664.741] KIRK: THAT IS HOW THE BALL CAME
[ct=5665.978] AL: MAYBE.
[ct=5668.364] >> FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5673.777] AL: RECOVERED BY THE DEFENSE, SO
[ct=5674.617] CHUCK CLARK, WHO HAD A BIG SACK
[ct=5676.744] FLOOR -- BEFORE, --
[ct=5679.626] KIRK: HE NOT ONLY RECOVERS IT
[ct=5681.720] BUT RIPS THE BALL OUT BEFORE THE
[ct=5681.720] BACK IS DOWN.
[ct=5684.314] THEY MIGHT TAKE A PEEK AT THIS,
[ct=5687.030] BUT STEPHENSON TRYING TO HOLD
[ct=5689.173] ONTO THE FOOTBALL BUT IT LOOKED
[ct=5690.605] LIKE AS HE WAS GOING DOWN, CHUCK
[ct=5693.639] CLARK RIPS THE FOOTBALL OUT OF
[ct=5693.639] HIS HANDS.
[ct=5698.970] THAT BALL IS OUT BEFORE HE
[ct=5699.275] TOUGH.
[ct=5699.541] WHAT A PLAY.
[ct=5701.762] AL: THAT IS CONFIRMED.
[ct=5704.265] IT IS NOT ABOUT GROWING UP BUT
[ct=5706.433] ABOUT HIM STEPPING UP WITH
[ct=5707.842] WHITEHEAD MOVING TO TAMPA,
[ct=5708.688] GETTING MORE AND MORE REPS WITH
[ct=5709.412] HIS SECONDARY.
[ct=5713.336] WE SAW BLITZ IN A GOOD PLAY
[ct=5717.295] EARLIER TONIGHT ON A SACK, AND
[ct=5717.461] STILL PLAYING AGGRESSIVE,
[ct=5719.390] TYPICAL JETS DEFENSE FOOTBALL.
[ct=5723.942] AL: THEY'VE BEEN AROUND EIGHT
[ct=5725.797] YEARS, PICKED THEM UP FROM
[ct=5725.993] BALTIMORE.
[ct=5729.239] AND HE IS THERE NUMBER THREE
[ct=5731.265] BACK, HE'S A ROOKIE, PICKED IN
[ct=5733.221] THE FIFTH ROUND OUT OF SOUTH
[ct=5733.461] DAKOTA STATE.
[ct=5737.438] ONE OF THE FEW GUYS IN SOUTH
[ct=5737.886] DAKOTA FOOTBALL I DON'T THINK
[ct=5738.549] YOU COVERED LAST YEAR.
[ct=5741.114] KIRK: NO, THE JACKRABBITS.
[ct=5741.549] HOW ABOUT THAT?
[ct=5745.974] AL: UNBELIEVABLE.
[ct=5745.974] YOU ARE JOHNNY CASH, YOU HAVE
[ct=5746.989] BEEN EVERYWHERE.
[ct=5749.820] KIRK: THEY LOVE FOOTBALL OUT
[ct=5751.188] THERE.
[ct=5755.264] AL: SECOND AND 6.
[ct=5766.878] TRIPPED UP.
[ct=5768.280] DAVIS AGAIN.
[ct=5771.756] JENNINGS MAKES THE TACKLE.
[ct=5774.783] KIRK: SO HE IS GOING TO BE OK.
[ct=5776.142] HE PUT THAT RIGHT ARM THERE TO
[ct=5778.807] BRING THE BALLCARRIER DOWN.
[ct=5781.527] RIGHT AWAY YOU CAN SEE THAT HE
[ct=5784.008] WAS FEELING THAT, HE WAS GOING
[ct=5784.008] TO COME OFF THE FIELD HERE.
[ct=5790.788] HE HAS AGAIN BEEN A GREAT STORY
[ct=5792.225] EARLY IN HIS CAREER, TRYING TO
[ct=5792.225] FIND HIS WAY.
[ct=5794.811] LAST YEAR, TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE
[ct=5794.811] OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=5798.812] MAYBE IT WAS WHEN HE CAME DOWN
[ct=5798.812] ON THAT SHOULDER, BUT HE HAS
[ct=5800.274] CHECKED OUT.
[ct=5808.151] AL: 50 YEAR IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=5809.603] 37.
[ct=5811.034] RODGERS FLICKS IT.
[ct=5814.909] ADJUSTING, MAKING THE GRAB, MIKE
[ct=5816.248] WILLIAMS.
[ct=5820.032] TURNED AROUND, HAULS IT IN, BEAT
[ct=5820.032] JONATHAN JONES ON THE PL
[ct=5824.182] KIRK: AARON RODGERS BRINGS UP
[ct=5826.824] BREECE HALL WITH PROTECTION AND
[ct=5828.090] THIS IS WHY THEY BROUGHT
[ct=5829.310] WILLIAMS OVER TO NEW YORK, FOR
[ct=5830.562] THESE OPPORTUNITIES.
[ct=5833.056] COMING OFF THAT A.C.L., WONDERED
[ct=5835.556] HOW MUCH SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO
[ct=5836.815] HELP, BUT THERE HE IS WITH
[ct=5837.926] PROTECTION.
[ct=5837.926] MIKE WILLIAMS MAKES THAT PLAY.
[ct=5841.474] HE HAS GOT TO COME BACK TO THE
[ct=5843.128] FOOTBALL OVER THE DEFENDER WITH
[ct=5843.128] THOSE LONG
[ct=5844.245] CATCH.
[ct=5848.552] AL: RODGERS HAS NOW THROWN FOR
[ct=5848.552] 273.
[ct=5861.449] MOVING, LOOKING, RUNNING, SLIDES
[ct=5862.931] TO A STOP AT THE 11 YARD LINE.
[ct=5873.380] KIRK: I THINK I GOTTEN OVER
[ct=5874.819] EVERY TIME HE HOLDS HIS BREATH,
[ct=5877.509] HE'S DONE IT SO MUCH TONIGHT,
[ct=5877.509] AND THEN YOU ARE STARTING TO GET
[ct=5879.963] COMFORTABLE AND SEEN HIM MAKE
[ct=5881.522] PLAYS, FIVE TO FIVE TONIGHT ON
[ct=5884.092] THE NIGHT, NATHANIEL HACKETT,
[ct=5887.019] AARON RODGERS FAMILIAR WITH EACH
[ct=5889.706] OTHER, BUT HE GETS OUT THERE,
[ct=5891.039] AND I THINK HE LOOKS BETTER THIS
[ct=5892.220] YEAR THAN HE DID HIS LAST YEAR
[ct=5893.763] IN GREEN BAY AS FAR AS
[ct=5895.103] AND MAKING PLAYS.
[ct=5897.549] AL: YOU MAY BE GETTING
[ct=5898.872] COMFORTABLE.
[ct=5901.680] I DON'T THINK ALL 75,000 ARE.
[ct=5903.042] SECOND DOWN AND EIGHTH.
[ct=5907.603] ALLEN, BACK TO THEM NINE YARD
[ct=5914.125] KAYLEE: THE JETS RIGHT TACKLE
[ct=5915.349] MORGAN MOSES HAS BEEN CONFIRMED
[ct=5918.140] TO BE A LEFT KNEE INJURY,
[ct=5918.140] THEY'VE TAKEN HIM TO THE X-R
[ct=5919.571] ROOM.
[ct=5922.011] ABOUT HOW YOU SAW HIM WALK OFF
[ct=5924.855] ON HIS OWN POWER, HE WENT INTO
[ct=5927.261] THE BLUE MEDICAL TENT, AND HE
[ct=5928.920] WALKED OFF THE FIELD ON EITHER
[ct=5930.527] SIDE UNTIL HE GOT TO THE TUN
[ct=5931.316] AND THAT HE WAS TAKEN BY A GOLF
[ct=5931.316] CART.
[ct=5933.939] AL: THERE IS WHITE.
[ct=5939.072] AND HE'S ALSO GOT THE EXTRA FEW
[ct=5940.653] DAYS BECAUSE YOU PLAY THURSDAY
[ct=5943.305] NIGHT, SO YOU HAVE THE EXTRA
[ct=5944.710] THREE DAYS, SO HE HAS
[ct=5945.892] DAYS TO GET READY FOR SAN
[ct=5947.397] FRANCISCO, THEIR NEXT STOP.
[ct=5951.102] KIRK: WE TALKED ABOUT THIS THIS
[ct=5952.140] WEEK, NATHANIEL HACKETT UNDER
[ct=5955.479] FIRE HERE IN NEW YORK, AND IS
[ct=5956.978] PART OF THE GIG.
[ct=5958.199] YOU KNOW WHEN THINGS ARE NOT
[ct=5958.859] GREAT, SOMEONE HAS TO BE THE
[ct=5958.859] FALL GUY.
[ct=5963.521] LAST YEAR HE WAS THAT GUY, BUT I
[ct=5965.078] REALLY LIKE TO WATCH THREE WEEKS
[ct=5967.892] AND, ESPECIALLY TONIGHT,
[ct=5969.061] STARTING TO SEE THIS PLAN AND
[ct=5969.525] THE VERSATILITY OF HOW THEY ARE
[ct=5971.402] ATTACKING.
[ct=5975.242] I HOPE FANS UNDERSTAND, AARON
[ct=5975.242] RODGERS HAD A SPECIAL NIGHT.
[ct=5976.355] THIS IS NOT JUST AARON RODGERS.
[ct=5980.203] THIS IS AN OFFENSIVE LINE
[ct=5980.203] SHOWING SOMETHING.
[ct=5982.122] RECEIVERS BESIDES GARRETT
[ct=5984.833] WILSON, TWO BACKS, A GREAT GROUP
[ct=5987.478] HACKETT PUTTING THAT PLAN
[ct=5990.174] AL: THEY HAVE DENVER NEXT,
[ct=5991.518] FRANCISCO.
[ct=5993.752] RODGERS AND THE END ZONE.
[ct=5996.439] CANNOT HOLD IT IN.
[ct=5997.670] MIKE WILLIAMS HAS MADE SO MANY
[ct=5999.721] OF THOSE CATCHES IN HIS CAREER
[ct=5999.721] WITH THE CHARGERS.
[ct=6001.577] NOT THIS TIME.
[ct=6002.708] 43.
[ct=6003.947] KIRK: JUST NOT QUITE.
[ct=6006.827] HE MAY HAVE MISSED TIME THA
[ct=6007.728] ONE.
[ct=6007.728] HE’
[ct=6008.946] HE'S SO GOOD AT GOING UP INTO
[ct=6011.635] THE AIR AND HIGH POINTING THE
[ct=6012.594] BALL WITH THESE CONTESTED
[ct=6012.594] CATCHES.
[ct=6015.431] HE WAS ACTUALLY STARTING TO COME
[ct=6017.653] DOWN, AND HECK OF AN EFFORT WITH
[ct=6019.123] JONATHAN JONES KNOCK GIVING UP,
[ct=6021.805] GETTING HIS HANDS ON THEIR AND
[ct=6021.805] DRIPPING IT AWAY FRO
[ct=6023.156] WILLIAMS ON THAT FADE.
[ct=6025.806] AL: JONES BEEN AWAY SIX INCHES.
[ct=6032.124] 64 AND A FIVE, 10TH DOWN.
[ct=6036.270] -- FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=6040.460] 28 YARD FIELD GOAL, TRYING TO
[ct=6042.853] MAKE IT 2 FIRST, HE WAS WITH THE
[ct=6044.384] PATRIOTS, AS YOU LOOK AT JEROD
[ct=6045.094] MAYO, THE CURRENT HEAD COACH.
[ct=6049.560] BILL WAS AN ASSISTANT IN NEW
[ct=6050.698] ENGLAND, THAT'S WHEN BOB KRAFT
[ct=6050.698] GOT TO KNOW HIM.
[ct=6054.241] CAME HERE TO NEW YORK AND THEN
[ct=6055.732] GOT THE JOB IN NEW ENGLAND.
[ct=6059.559] MAYO AT 38 IN HIS FIRST YEAR,
[ct=6062.245] AND BELICHICK, YOU LOOK AT BILL
[ct=6067.143] BELICHICK NOW, OF ALL THINGS TV,
[ct=6068.597] HE IS EVERYWHERE.
[ct=6073.067] HE IS THE KING OF ALL MEDIA,
[ct=6073.067] FROM HOWARD STERN.
[ct=6074.544] KIRK: AND HE'S KILLING IT.
[ct=6077.378] HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB.
[ct=6080.315] HE AND NICK SABIN BOTH DOING A
[ct=6081.853] GREAT JOB GOING INTO THAT ROL
[ct=6083.332] WE WOULD NOT EXPECT EITHER ONE
[ct=6084.415] OF THEM TO DO THAT.
[ct=6086.238] BOTH SEEM TO BE ENJOYING IT.
[ct=6089.840] AL: MAYO WAS DESIGNATED EARLY ON
[ct=6092.560] BY BOB KRAFT AS THE LIKELY
[ct=6094.496] SUCCESSOR, AND IT GOES ALL THE
[ct=6098.735] WAY BACK TO LIKE 2015 OR
[ct=6100.068] WHEN MAYO WAS PART OF THE TRIP
[ct=6101.403] TO ISRAEL.
[ct=6106.855] TAKING A LOT OF HIS CURRENT AND
[ct=6106.855] FORMER PLAYERS TO ISRAEL AS THE
[ct=6107.852] CATCH IS MADE HERE.
[ct=6111.008] NINE YARD GAIN FOR DOUGLAS.
[ct=6117.291] HE WATCHED THE WAY MAYO WAS
[ct=6117.683] RESPONDING TO THE OLDER GUYS,
[ct=6121.337] AND HOW HIS PRESENCE AND MANNER,
[ct=6123.753] AND BOB KRAFT THOUGHT WHEN THE
[ct=6125.013] TIME COMES, HE'S G
[ct=6125.945] GUY, AND HE WAS.
[ct=6127.938] KIRK: THERE IS A GREAT MESSAGE
[ct=6131.972] YOU THINK JEROD MAYO HAD A
[ct=6133.957] IDEA THAT ROBERT KRAFT WAS
[ct=6135.315] SITTING, WATCHING HIM AND MAKING
[ct=6137.646] A DECISION THAT WOULD YEARS
[ct=6137.646] LATER IMPACT HIS LIFE?
[ct=6140.135] THINK ABOUT THAT.
[ct=6140.135] YOU NEVER KNOW.
[ct=6142.972] JUST DOING THE RIGHT THING AND
[ct=6143.968] SHOWING WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT.
[ct=6145.407] AL: EXACTLY.
[ct=6149.598] SWINGING TO THE OUTSIDE AND
[ct=6150.837] TAKEN DOWN THERE IS GIBSON.
[ct=6155.324] SECOND DOWN.
[ct=6158.204] KIRK: JEROD MAYO THESE FIRST
[ct=6159.799] COUPLE OF GAMES HAS BEEN ABLE TO
[ct=6160.955] BE COMPETITIVE.
[ct=6161.970] I WENT TO THE G
[ct=6162.958] IT WAS A GAME THAT T
[ct=6164.335] CONTROLLED.
[ct=6167.105] GOOD JOB OF WINNING THE TIME OF
[ct=6169.935] POSSESSION, THEY WERE WINNING,
[ct=6169.935] THEY WERE ABLE TO
[ct=6171.342] CLOCK, AND THEY GOT OUT OF THERE
[ct=6172.689] WITH A WIN.
[ct=6173.783] AND THE SAME KIND OF GAME FOR
[ct=6176.683] SEATTLE WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO
[ct=6176.683] CONTROL THINGS.
[ct=6179.318] THEY DID NOT WIN, BUT THEY
[ct=6180.458] BATTLED.
[ct=6183.390] HERE TONIGHT, RIGHT AWAY, THE
[ct=6184.713] GAME GETS AWAY FROM AARON
[ct=6187.404] RODGERS, HAVING A NIGHT, AND IF
[ct=6191.240] ANYBODY YOU ABOUT THE
[ct=6192.379] MATCHUP, THEY KNOW JEROD MAYO'S
[ct=6193.790] TEAM NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO KEEP
[ct=6195.581] AARON RODGERS ON THE SIDELINE,
[ct=6197.917] SQUEEZE THE CLOCK, AND ONCE THAT
[ct=6198.708] DID NOT HAPPEN WITH THIS
[ct=6200.349] OFFENSIVE LINE AND WERE WITH
[ct=6202.682] WHERE THEY ARE AT THIS STAGE OF
[ct=6203.992] THE GAME OFFENSIVELY, IT IS
[ct=6205.403] CHALLENGING FOR THEM TO GET
[ct=6208.113] PREDICTABLE PLAYCALLING.
[ct=6209.448] IT IS JUST OUT THERE GAME, AND
[ct=6210.651] IT WILL BE THAT WAY THIS YEAR.
[ct=6212.116] THAT IS WHY THEY WILL HAVE TO
[ct=6212.116] CONTINUE TO
[ct=6213.507] SIDE OF THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=6216.034] AL: I THINK THEY WILL HAVE
[ct=6217.639] FIND A TOP GUY IS A WIDE
[ct=6220.191] MEANWHILE, THAT LINE BREAKING
[ct=6223.496] DOWN AGAIN, AND HERE COME THE
[ct=6227.445] GANGRENE GUYS, JAVON KINLAW CAME
[ct=6228.986] OVER FROM SAN
[ct=6230.250] A SACK.
[ct=6234.056] KIRK: QUINCY WILSON, QUINCY
[ct=6235.519] WILLIAMS, RATHER, BRINGING
[ct=6236.528] EVEN THOUGH HE DOESN'T GET
[ct=6240.075] THERE, HE OCCUPIES THE BACK,
[ct=6241.759] FREEZE UP OTHERS TO GET THERE,
[ct=6243.140] AND WE ARE NOT USED TO SEEING
[ct=6245.530] JEFF ALDRICH DIAL IT UP, BUT
[ct=6247.032] HE'S WISE IN CHANGING
[ct=6248.356] AGAINST THIS INEXPERIENCED
[ct=6251.022] IT HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE.
[ct=6252.165] AL: FIFTH PUNT.
[ct=6253.757] BEHRINGER.
[ct=6256.531] FIELDED AT THE 10, TAKEN DOWN
[ct=6258.749] RIGHT AWAY IS GIBSON.
[ct=6260.551] KIRK: HOW GOOD IS HE?
[ct=6263.119] BEHRINGER GETS THE GA
[ct=6263.967] NEW ENGLAND.
[ct=6263.967] HE'S A WEAPON.
[ct=6267.061] AL: HE DOES.
[ct=6273.532] THE TACKLE IS MADE, ANDTHAT IS T
[ct=6276.118] THE NOTES FROM AROUND THE LEAGUE
[ct=6278.873] , WHEN IT COMES TO FIELD GOALS,
[ct=6281.611] IT IS CRAZY.
[ct=6282.746] 35 OF 39 FROM 50 PLUS.
[ct=6289.561] AND RODGERS IS GOING TO THROW TO
[ct=6289.561] THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=6290.852] CAUGHT HERE.
[ct=6294.696] SPUN DOWN AS GARRETT WILSON.
[ct=6294.696] I HAVE AN IDEA THERE.
[ct=6297.577] IT'S CRAZY NOW, IT’S LIKE TOO
[ct=6302.818] MUCH, 32-35-39, 50 PLUS, I WOULD
[ct=6305.658] LIKE TO DEFLATE THE CAVE ALL.
[ct=6306.663] KIRK: I HEARD YOU SAY THAT
[ct=6306.663] EARLIER.
[ct=6310.699] NARROWING THE UPRISE.
[ct=6311.989] AL: COULD DO THAT.
[ct=6314.814] KIRK: YOU ARE BIG ON THAT.
[ct=6317.567] AL: I WOULD LIKE TO GET THE
[ct=6317.567] TOUCH BACK AFTER THE 35 YARD
[ct=6320.159] KIRK: KIRK: TWO THINGS.
[ct=6322.721] AL: IF COMMISSIONER FOR A DAY.
[ct=6323.961] THANK GOD I'M NOT.
[ct=6326.677] SECOND AND 2.
[ct=6333.494] RODGERS TAKES THE PLAY CLOCK ALL
[ct=6334.835] THE WAY DOWN.
[ct=6337.497] AND ALMOST
[ct=6338.770] DOWN AND ONE.
[ct=6341.881] KIRK: JETS, THREE OFFENSIVE
[ct=6345.611] TOUCHDOWNS IN EACH OF THE FIRST
[ct=6345.611] THREE GAMES THIS YEAR.
[ct=6349.438] LAST TIME THEY DID THAT, 1989.
[ct=6353.391] SO I DO NOT WANT TO JINX THE
[ct=6354.355] JETS BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN A TOUGH
[ct=6357.362] RUN, BUT ANYBODY WATCHING THE
[ct=6358.678] GAME, WE SAW BUFFALO LAST
[ct=6360.011] AGAINST MIAMI, AND I THINK WE
[ct=6362.857] LEFT THAT NIGHT THINKING THAT
[ct=6364.183] BUFFALO HAS A CHANCE IF THEY CAN
[ct=6371.977] -- IF THE JETS STAY HEALTHY,
[ct=6373.315] IT'S GOING TO BE A FUN YEAR.
[ct=6376.154] HEALTH.
[ct=6378.299] AL: VERY INTERESTING.
[ct=6384.432] TAKING MORE TIME OFF THE CLOCK.
[ct=6385.842] OTHER NEWS AND SPORTS.
[ct=6388.467] SHOW A OTANI TONIGHT.
[ct=6389.798] THE DODGERS IN MIAMI.
[ct=6393.052] 6-6, THREE HOMERS, 10 RUNS
[ct=6393.052] BATTED IN.
[ct=6395.761] HE NOW HAS 51 HOMERS AND 51
[ct=6397.112] STEALS.
[ct=6399.109] KIRK: FIRST PLAYER IN MAJOR
[ct=6400.612] LEAGUE BASEBALL HISTORY, IS THAT
[ct=6400.612] RIGHT?
[ct=6403.635] AL: THAT 50-50 CLUB.
[ct=6407.125] NEXT YEAR, HE'S GOING TO PITCH
[ct=6407.902] ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS.
[ct=6409.717] KIRK: I DON’
[ct=6410.198] KIRK: I DON'T THINK HE GETS THE
[ct=6413.502] LOVE THAT HE DESERVES.
[ct=6414.903] IT WAS BETTER WHEN HE WAS WITH
[ct=6414.903] THE ANGELS.
[ct=6419.234] AL: WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI,
[ct=6419.814] WEST OF COLORADO ANYWAY.
[ct=6421.212] 20 YARD LINE.
[ct=6424.886] 20 YARD GAIN HERE.
[ct=6425.092] CHEWING UP THE REST OF THE
[ct=6425.376] CLOCK.
[ct=6430.100] KIRK: TONIGHT IS A BIG NIGHT.
[ct=6431.756] WE ARE ONLY AT WEEK THREE.
[ct=6432.161] SUCH A LONG WAY TO GO.
[ct=6435.327] IT'S MORE THAN AARON RODGERS.
[ct=6438.714] AARON RODGERS IS LOOKING GREAT.
[ct=6439.453] TALKED A LOT ABOUT HIM.
[ct=6443.302] THE MOVEMENT, THE COMMAND OF THE
[ct=6443.829] OFFENSE, ALL THAT HE NORMALLY
[ct=6444.439] DOES.
[ct=6446.509] THEN THE MOVEMENT OUT OF THE
[ct=6452.541] WHAT'S AROUND HIM.
[ct=6455.018] DRAKE MAY MIGHT POTENTIALLY COME
[ct=6455.018] IN.
[ct=6456.379] THE LINE, THE PACKS, THE
[ct=6460.776] THE TIGHT END, CONKLIN.
[ct=6464.722] AL: UP THE MIDDLE.
[ct=6466.203] ALAN.
[ct=6472.641] EARLY-SEASON TRENDS.
[ct=6475.300] FIELD GOALS MADE.
[ct=6478.019] KIRK: 70 31 WEEK.
[ct=6480.665] AL: CRAZY.
[ct=6480.928] 16 GAMES.
[ct=6487.452] KIRK: WE TALKED ABOUT IT LAST
[ct=6487.748] WEEK.
[ct=6491.618] DEFENSE'S TREND IS PLAYING
[ct=6491.843] COVERAGE.
[ct=6492.455] IT'S NOT JUST COVERAGE.
[ct=6496.992] IT'S MORE OF PUTTING ATOP ON THE
[ct=6498.297] DEFENSE, REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE
[ct=6498.297] COVERAGES.
[ct=6502.244] OFFENSES ARE TAKING LONGER AND
[ct=6504.459] LONGER TO BUILD THE CHEMISTRY,
[ct=6504.459] TIMING, RHYTHM.
[ct=6506.197] I'VE HEARD A LOT OF COACHES
[ct=6508.740] TALKING ABOUT, THEY DON'T
[ct=6509.778] PRACTICE IN THE OFF-SEASON IS
[ct=6509.778] MUCH AS THEY USED TO.
[ct=6511.305] IT TAKES LONGER
[ct=6512.710] TIMING.
[ct=6516.854] AL: TRYING TO HIT WILSON.
[ct=6517.779] THAT WOULD HAVE PUT HIM OVER 300
[ct=6519.135] YARDS BUT NO.
[ct=6521.841] IT DOES INDEED LOOK LIKE HE'S
[ct=6523.087] GOING TO MAKE HIS NFL DEBUT.
[ct=6527.127] KIRK: THE ONLY BALL THAT AARON
[ct=6527.127] RODGERS WOULD LOVE TO HAVE BACK.
[ct=6532.568] HE HAD AN OPENING THEIR AND JUST
[ct=6533.636] DIDN'T QUITE GET IT TO GARRETT
[ct=6539.066] THAT ONE PASS, HE'S FRUSTRATED
[ct=6539.066] WITH HIMSELF.
[ct=6540.371] HOPE THAT DOESN'T RUIN HIS
[ct=6540.371] NIGHT.
[ct=6542.723] HE'S HAD A GOOD NIGHT.
[ct=6543.979] AL: I DOUBT IT.
[ct=6546.783] THIRD PUNT OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=6554.394] ATTACKING THE 42 YARD LINE.
[ct=6565.539] AL: DRAKE MAY COME OF THE N
[ct=6567.319] THREE OVERALL PICK IN THE DRAFT.
[ct=6570.019] CALEB WILLIAMS WENT NUMBER ONE
[ct=6570.264] TO THE CHICAGO BEARS.
[ct=6573.110] THERE ARE HIS NUMBERS.
[ct=6574.418] IN CHAPEL HILL.
[ct=6578.290] THIS IS NOT QUITE THROWING HIM
[ct=6580.895] TO THE WOLVES HERE.
[ct=6583.462] IT FIGURES TO BE FAIRLY
[ct=6586.340] CONSERVATIVE, YOU WOULD THINK.
[ct=6586.340] LET'S SEE.
[ct=6588.648] STARTS OUT WITH THE PASS ON THE
[ct=6590.208] FIRST PLAY.
[ct=6592.759] NEARLY A PICK.
[ct=6593.817] THAT WOULD'VE BEEN SOMETHING.
[ct=6598.050] KIRK: HOW MUCH WOULD HE HAVE
[ct=6598.050] LOVED THAT?
[ct=6600.490] TO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO
[ct=6601.912] INTERCEPT THAT.
[ct=6604.789] HIS FIRST REP AS AN NFL PLAYER
[ct=6606.055] AND HE TELEGRAPHS IT.
[ct=6608.793] YOU CAN SEE THE VETERAN CARTER
[ct=6610.177] BAITING HIM AND STEPPING IN
[ct=6611.452] FRONT OF IT ALMOST COMES UP WITH
[ct=6612.532] THE INTERCEPTION.
[ct=6617.792] AL: UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE.
[ct=6619.034] 12-18 FOR 98 YARDS.
[ct=6623.100] NOW ON THE GROUND IS ANTONIO
[ct=6627.148] FOUR MINUTES TO PLAY IN THE
[ct=6628.484] FOURTH.
[ct=6640.258] THIRD AND 3.
[ct=6649.804] HE IS GOING TO TAKE OFF BUT NOT
[ct=6649.804] GO VERY FAR.
[ct=6653.992] HE IS TACKLED BY SHERWOOD AT THE
[ct=6653.992] 50 YARD LINE.
[ct=6658.744] KIRK: MAYE IS NOT A GUY THAT CAN
[ct=6659.937] GET AWAY FROM PRESSURE.
[ct=6663.667] SHERWOOD IS A FORMER SAFETY AND
[ct=6664.886] HAS EMERGED IN THESE LAST FOUR
[ct=6667.957] YEARS AS A LINEBACKER WHO IS
[ct=6669.215] CONTROLLING THE MIDDL
[ct=6670.620] WELCOMES HIM TO THE NFL.
[ct=6674.631] AL: THAT'S THE WELCOME.
[ct=6675.991] SAME THING.
[ct=6677.302] MEANWHILE, BREAKING TABLES AND
[ct=6678.565] ABLE TO PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN
[ct=6678.565] IS GIBSON.
[ct=6684.312] KIRK: JETS ROTATING SOMEBODY'S
[ct=6687.239] IN BUT THEY ARE NOT CHANGING
[ct=6687.239] THEIR PHILOSOPHY.
[ct=6689.706] THEY WILL BE AGGRESSIVE TO THE
[ct=6689.706] FINAL WHISTLE.
[ct=6692.314] IT'S JUST THE DNA OF THIS
[ct=6693.679] DEFENSE.
[ct=6697.687] AL: SCREEN HERE.
[ct=6698.952] NO BLOCKING OUT IN FRONT.
[ct=6704.734] HE MAKES THE TACKLE ON QUINCY.
[ct=6706.484] KIRK: IT MAKES YOU WONDER.
[ct=6710.994] AT -- ARE BOTH SIDES ABLE TO
[ct=6710.994] WORK THIS THING OUT?
[ct=6713.498] CAN YOU IMAGINE ADDING
[ct=6714.660] TO THIS DEFENSE WITH YOUR MAIN
[ct=6717.302] JOHNSON DOWN, EVENTUALLY COMES
[ct=6719.805] MAN.
[ct=6721.005] YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT
[ct=6721.005] WORKED OUT.
[ct=6728.457] AL: THE JETS SAY NO, WE ARE NOT
[ct=6729.971] GETTING RID OF HIM.
[ct=6731.334] WE ARE NOT LETTING HIM GO.
[ct=6736.301] KIRK: NOW THAT CHUCK CLARK IS
[ct=6737.848] COMING ALONG, D.J. REED, TONY
[ct=6740.539] ADAMS, SAUCE GARDNER, MICHAEL
[ct=6741.896] CARTER.
[ct=6743.297] THAT'S A HECK OF
[ct=6744.518] BACKEND.
[ct=6747.490] GREAT LINEBACKERS WITH WILLIAMS
[ct=6747.490] AND SHERWOOD AND MOSLEY.
[ct=6749.757] AND THEN THE FRONT IS AS GOOD AS
[ct=6749.757] YOU FIND.
[ct=6751.425] THAT'S TERRIFYING.
[ct=6754.684] AL: THIRD AND 2.
[ct=6756.467] CATCHES MADE.
[ct=6759.379] THE THROATED JOHNSON.
[ct=6760.773] JUDGE COMES IN THEIR.
[ct=6761.692] YOU SEE WHERE THEY SPOTTED.
[ct=6766.028] KIRK: -- >> THIS IS.
[ct=6771.121] AL: IN THE MEANTIME, THAT'S THE
[ct=6771.121] TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=6775.620] TWO MINUTES UNTIL THE JETS ARE
[ct=6778.198] OFFICIALLY 2-1.
[ct=6780.645] KIRK: NINE FOR AARON RODGERS.
[ct=6781.573] REALLY COMMENDED THE OFFENSE.
[ct=6785.371] THAT'S THE THING TONIGHT.
[ct=6785.371] HE GOT OUTSIDE OF THE POCKET.
[ct=6789.535] 5-5 ON THE RUN.
[ct=6792.596] WHAT A LASER FOR THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=6795.971] THIS OFFENSE WILL CONTINUE TO
[ct=6796.386] NATHANIEL HACKETT PUTTING THE
[ct=6800.380] PLAN TOGETHER, OFTEN CRITICIZED
[ct=6800.380] OFFENSIVE COURT NADER.
[ct=6803.292] HE'S A GREAT COORDINATOR.
[ct=6806.162] WHEN WE GO OUT AND EXECUTE.
[ct=6808.811] NOTHING MAKES ME HAPPIER THAN TO
[ct=6809.429] TRY TO GET OUT THERE AND SHOW
[ct=6810.712] PEOPLE WHAT KIND OF COACHING CAN
[ct=6812.102] BE.
[ct=6813.586] BIG NIGHT FOR HIM AS WELL.
[ct=6814.951] AL: HE REALLY WANTS TO PLAY
[ct=6820.240] TAKES THE HEAT AWAY FROM
[ct=6820.240] HACKETT.
[ct=6824.191] HEAT ON MAYE AND TO GET SACKED
[ct=6824.721] AT THE 44 YARD LINE.
[ct=6828.052] KIRK: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR
[ct=6828.052] NEXGEN STAFFS.
[ct=6832.199] THE PATRIOTS, 14 MISSED TACKLES.
[ct=6836.282] 100 -- 100 YARDS THAT THEY LOST
[ct=6840.322] YOU COULD EITHER LOOK AT IT ONE
[ct=6841.345] WAY -- T
[ct=6844.658] BETTER JOB AT RUNNING THE
[ct=6846.280] FOOTBALL AND TACKLING.
[ct=6848.215] THE JETS DID A HECKUVA JOB AFTER
[ct=6849.622] THE CATCH, ESPECIALLY EARLY IN
[ct=6849.622] THIS GAME.
[ct=6853.459] WITH ACCURATE PASSES.
[ct=6854.848] GIVES YOU THOSE OPPORTUNITIES.
[ct=6854.848] THEY DID A HECKUVA
