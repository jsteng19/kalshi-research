[ct=5.180] FINGER ON HIS THROWING HAND.
[ct=7.942] HE SAID HE SAW A LOOK IN HIS
[ct=8.164] TEAM'S EYES.
[ct=10.527] THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE IN HIM
[ct=11.073] BECAUSE THEY SAY HE'S BEEN
[ct=13.161] BUILDING IT THROUGH THESE FIVE
[ct=15.902] YEARS, GOING UP AGAINST THE
[ct=16.354] CHARGERS FIRST-TEAM DEFENSE.
[ct=18.546] AUSTIN EKELER CALLDR.

[ct=22.012] AND PRACTICE WITH HIS BALL
[ct=24.768] PLACEMENT, MAKING SUPERSTAR
[ct=25.008] THROWS.
[ct=26.453] WE WILL SEE IF HE CAN DO IT ON
[ct=27.207] THE PRIMETIME STAGE TONIGHT.
[ct=31.557] AL: HIS MOMENT HAS
[ct=32.849] ARRIVED.
[ct=34.196] JUSTIN HERBERT HAS BEEN AN
[ct=35.526] IRONMAN SINCE SHE WAS DRAFTED --

[ct=71.981] TALKED TO HIM A LOT IN THE
[ct=71.981] PREGAME SHOW.
[ct=74.900] NORTH DAKOTA STATE FOR FOUR
[ct=75.112] YEARS.
[ct=77.328] HE WAS THERE WHEN CARSON WENTZ
[ct=77.328] WAS THERE.
[ct=80.160] WHEN HE SHOWED UP AT SCHOOL, HE

[ct=104.064] DIABLO IN ON THE TACKLE.

[ct=110.980] DIFFICULT PART OF THE YEAR,
[ct=111.418] RUNNING THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=113.689] A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOKED AT AUSTIN
[ct=115.064] EKELER.
[ct=116.528] HE LED THE NFL IN RUSHING LAST
[ct=118.881] A LOT OF IT HAS BEEN THE
[ct=119.052] OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=122.302] YOU CAN SPECIFICALLY LOOK OUT ON
[ct=122.957] THE EDGES OF THE TIGHT ENDS.
[ct=125.951] THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO A
[ct=127.161] BETTER JOB TONIGHT RUNNING THE
[ct=127.773] FOOTBALL AND TAKING THE PRESSURE
[ct=128.126] OFF OF STICK.
[ct=130.275] AL: STICK SETS IT UP HERE.
[ct=133.959] ECKLER WILL TAKE IT UP TO THE 38
[ct=138.747] YARD LINE.
[ct=139.500] THIRD DOWN AND SHORT.
[ct=139.753] YOU WILL SEE THAT MANNING IN

[ct=166.774] INCOMPLETE.
[ct=169.263] TRIED TO GET IT INTO GERALD

[ct=172.532] THE CHARGERS BEGIN WITH A THREE
[ct=172.606] AND OUT.
[ct=176.461] ANTONIO PIERCE IS THE INTERIM
[ct=177.849] HEAD COACH.
[ct=178.242] TOOK OVER WHEN JOSH MCDANIELS
[ct=180.022] GOT FIRED HALFWAY THROUGH THE
[ct=182.676] HE WON THE FIRST TWO GAMES BUT
[ct=183.356] HAS LOST HIS LAST THREE.
[ct=186.773] KIRK: THIS WEEK, HE TALKED
[ct=187.514] ABOUT, EMBARRASSED AND
[ct=187.933] DISAPPOINTED.
[ct=189.934] HE SAID, THESE GUYS ARE PROS.

[ct=200.289] AL: JK SCOTT IN TO PUNT.
[ct=204.261] DEANDRE CARTER BACK TO RECEIVE.
[ct=206.932] STANDING INSIDE HIS OWN 15 YARD
[ct=206.932] LINE.
[ct=214.886] FAIR CATCH CALLED FOR.
[ct=218.890] AND THEN THE CONTACT IS A FLAG.
[ct=220.225] ANOTHER FLAG.
[ct=222.849] RUNNING INTO HIM WAS JOSHUA
[ct=224.190] TAYLOR.
[ct=229.845] SO TAYLOR, NOT GIVING HIM THE
[ct=229.845] OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE FAIR
[ct=231.188] CATCH.
[ct=231.188] THAT WILL COST HIM.
[ct=236.468] RONALD TORBERT IS THE REFEREE
[ct=236.468] TONIGHT.
[ct=244.418] >> FAIR CATCH INTERFERENCE.
[ct=246.967] NUMBER 36.

[ct=260.297] AL: SO THE RAIDERS NOW -- HERE
[ct=260.297] IS AIDAN O'CONNELL.
[ct=262.893] THIS HAS TO BE A BIT OF A
[ct=262.893] NIGHTMARE FOR HIM.
[ct=265.620] HE STARTED AGAINST THE CHARGERS
[ct=266.877] IN L.A. WEEK FOUR.
[ct=266.877] WHAT HAPPENED?
[ct=270.827] HE GOT SACKED SEVEN TIMES IN THE
[ct=270.827] GAME.
[ct=273.685] SIX TIMES BY THAT MAN KHALIL
[ct=273.685] MACK.
[ct=274.978] THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.
[ct=278.979] KIRK: HIS FIRST START IS AGAINST
[ct=278.979] KHALIL MACK.
[ct=281.690] SIX SACKS AND HERE WE ARE AGAIN.
[ct=284.217] AL: JOSH JACOBS,
[ct=285.556] BACK.
[ct=285.556] HE'S OUT TONIGHT.
[ct=290.533] HE WILL START HERE WITH A RUN TO
[ct=290.533] THE 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=294.498] HE WILL BE THE MAIN GUY
[ct=295.796] SECOND-YEAR GUY OUT OF GEORGIA,
[ct=297.164] YEAR.
[ct=301.149] KIRK: HE'S VERY DIFFERENT STYLE.
[ct=302.485] JOSH JACOBS OBVIOUSLY HAD SOME
[ct=305.127] SHAKE SIDE TO SIDE JUMP CUTS.
[ct=311.631] HE'S A DOWNHILL RUNNER.
[ct=314.181] ONE CUT AND GET NORTH AND SOUTH.
[ct=315.516] YOU SAW THAT THERE ON
[ct=316.860] CARRY.
[ct=318.161] GREAT BLOCK UPFRONT BY JAKOB
[ct=319.542] JOHNSON.
[ct=326.593] AL: DAVE DROP.

[ct=333.956] PLAY.
[ct=336.488] COVERING FOR THE
[ct=337.843] OUT OF CINCINNATI.
[ct=339.168] THIRD DOWN AND 2.
[ct=343.563] KIRK: THEY FELT THEY HAD SOME
[ct=343.563] OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE SPEED OF
[ct=344.857] TUCKER.
[ct=346.146] THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD GO TO IT
[ct=346.146] EARLY.
[ct=348.848] HE WINS AT THE LINE OF
[ct=348.848] SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=351.303] HE HAS A CHANCE TO PUT A BIG
[ct=352.596] PLAY UP ON THE BOARD.
[ct=355.278] THE BALL BRINGS HIM BACK.
[ct=355.278] DAVIS CATCHES THE BREAK.
[ct=359.557] THREE RECEIVERS TO THE FIELD.
[ct=362.457] ONE BACK TO THE BOUNDARY TO
[ct=362.457] CREATE THAT ONE-ON-ONE MATCHUP.
[ct=363.566] THEY MISSE
[ct=364.892] THERE.
[ct=367.138] KIRK: THIRD DOWN -- AL: THIRD
[ct=368.380] DOWN AND 2.
[ct=372.376] DOWN OF THE GAME.
[ct=374.997] KEEPING THOSE THE -- LEGS
[ct=374.997] MOVING.
[ct=378.988] WITHOUT JACOBS, THAT'S A BIG
[ct=378.988] LOSS.
[ct=381.438] IT'S AMEER ABDULLAH.
[ct=384.066] HE AND WHITE CARRY THE
[ct=386.769] TONIGHT ON THE GROUND.
[ct=389.378] KIRK: KNOWN FOR HIS ABILITY TO
[ct=389.378] CATCH THE BALL.
[ct=392.097] THE ROCK.
[ct=394.732] AL: FIRST DOWN.
[ct=403.976] TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=406.565] THAT'S BROKEN UP.
[ct=411.873] INTENDED FOR DAVANTE ADAMS.
[ct=415.818] HE CAME HERE LAST YEAR AND
[ct=417.190] WANTED TO REUNITE WITH DEREK
[ct=417.190] CARR.
[ct=418.527] IT'S BEEN A TOUGH SEA
[ct=419.830] RIGHT NOW.
[ct=422.521] KIRK: IT SURE HAS.
[ct=423.814] HE'S BEEN FRUSTRATED FOR OBVIOUS
[ct=423.814] REASONS.
[ct=426.539] HERE, JUST REALLY GOOD COVERAGE
[ct=426.539] BY SAMUEL.
[ct=428.868] THE RAIDERS THROUGH SECOND
[ct=430.559] SHORT.
[ct=431.493] THEY TAKE THE SHOT DOWNFIELD.
[ct=436.805] FIRST AND 10 BOTH TIMES.
[ct=436.805] HE HAD TIME TO THROW.
[ct=440.539] AL: WHY NOT TAKE SOME CHANCES AT
[ct=441.899] THIS POINT OF THE SEASON?
[ct=448.513] FIRED OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=449.863] THAT'S CAUGHT.
[ct=449.863] TAKING INTO THE 47 YARD LINE.
[ct=453.837] ADAMS MAKING THE GRAB AFTER SOME
[ct=456.497] STELLAR YEARS WITH AARON RODGERS
[ct=457.843] AT GREEN BAY.
[ct=457.843] NOW IN HIS SECOND SEASON HERE.
[ct=461.817] KIRK: THEY MOVE HIM AROUND.
[ct=461.817] THEY DO A GOOD JOB OF DOING
[ct=463.159] THAT.
[ct=465.797] THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO CREATE
[ct=467.100] MATCH UPS AND PREVENT TEAMS FROM
[ct=469.823] LOADING UP ON HIM AND ROLLING
[ct=469.823] COVERAGE TOWARD HIM.
[ct=473.760] HE'S HAD A BRILLIANT CAREER.
[ct=475.039] ONE THING ABOUT HIM IS THAT THEY
[ct=476.858] GAVE HIM SO MUCH FREEDOM AT THE
[ct=478.125] LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=480.819] WORKING THE OTHER WAY.
[ct=484.642] AL: THIRD AND 2.
[ct=486.011] NICE RUN HERE.
[ct=491.297] ERIC KENDRICKS MAKES THE TACKLE
[ct=492.634] FOR THE CHARGERS.
[ct=497.952] KIRK: HE DOESN'T NICE JOB.
[ct=500.412] SHOWS THAT IT'S A DRAW
[ct=501.715] SETS UP.
[ct=504.324] NICE KICK OUT BLOCK ON JOSEPH
[ct=504.324] DAY.
[ct=505.700] THE TIGHT END COMING AROUND
[ct=506.986] MICHAEL MAYER.
[ct=509.700] JUST LIKE THAT, THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=511.029] LINE OPENING UP SOME ROOM FOR
[ct=511.029] THESE BACKS.
[ct=522.526] AL: ON THE GROUND.
[ct=523.760] NOTHING HAPPENING THERE.
[ct=529.481] HE'S -- THIS IS HIS 11TH SEASON
[ct=530.398] IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=533.029] MOST OF THEM WITH NEW ENGLAND.
[ct=534.345] OWNS A COUPLE OF RINGS.
[ct=536.944] KIRK: ONE OF THE REOCCURRING
[ct=539.605] THEMES WE SEE IN THE NFL IS
[ct=540.924] RESHUFFLING OFFENSIVE LINEMAN.
[ct=543.735] THAT'S WHAT THE RAIDERS HAVE TO
[ct=545.080] DO TONIGHT.
[ct=546.446] THEY HAVE SOME INJURIES TO THEIR
[ct=546.446] STARTING CENTER.
[ct=549.059] MILLER IS OUT.
[ct=551.716] YOU CAN SEE THEY'VE HAD TO
[ct=553.061] RESHUFFLE THE DECK.
[ct=555.951] EVEN THE RIGHT TACKLE WAS
[ct=557.253] HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN PLAYING
[ct=558.599] TONIGHT EITHER.
[ct=561.215] AL: FIRST CARRY OF THE YEAR.
[ct=562.567] THEY'VE ALREADY USED THREE
[ct=562.567] RUNNING BACKS.
[ct=565.203] HUNTER RENFROW MAKING THAT.
[ct=566.563] WOULD HAVE BEEN A SEVEN YARD
[ct=567.864] GAIN.
[ct=575.839] BRANDON STALEY IN HIS THIRD
[ct=579.846] PENALTY -- PENALTY WILL BE
[ct=579.846] AGAINST LOS ANGELES.
[ct=585.055] >> OUTSIDE.
[ct=589.050] DEFENSE NUMBER THREE.
[ct=589.050] FIVE YARD PENALTY.
[ct=594.367] AL: BRANDON STALEY TOOK OVER IN
[ct=595.694] THE 2021 SEASON.
[ct=598.410] ANY TIME YOU HAVE A
[ct=599.709] DISAPPOINTING SEASON LIKE THIS
[ct=601.045] WERE SO MUCH AS EXPECTED, THE
[ct=602.402] COACH WILL BE ON THE HOT SEAT.
[ct=605.026] THEY WILL ASSESS AT THE END OF
[ct=607.511] THE SEASON AND WE WILL FIND OUT
[ct=607.511] ABOUT HIS FUTURE
[ct=608.835] OF A LOT OF OTHER GUYS.
[ct=611.494] KIRK: THINK ABOUT THIS.
[ct=614.135] AUSTIN EKELER, KEENAN ALLEN,
[ct=614.135] MIKE WILLIAMS.
[ct=616.798] THREE OF THEIR STARS.
[ct=618.091] THEY FALL BEEN AT THE -- ON THE
[ct=620.790] FIELD AT THE SAME TIME ONLY 9%
[ct=620.790] OF THE TIME.
[ct=626.080] AL: ALAN IS OUT TONIGHT.
[ct=630.054] CAUGHT.
[ct=635.469] MISS THE WALK-THROUGH YESTERDAY
[ct=635.469] WITH AN ILLNESS.
[ct=636.800] LOOKING SHARP
[ct=642.087] KIRK: THEY BRING THE LINEBACKERS
[ct=642.087] AND THAT GAVE HIM ROOM TO
[ct=643.804] IN THE MIDDLE.
[ct=643.804] PRESSURE HERE.
[ct=647.405] YOU ARE NOT GOING TO WIN THIS.
[ct=648.780] NOBODY IS GOING TO STOP HIM AT
[ct=648.780] THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=651.622] LOOK AT THE ROOM BECAUSE OF THE
[ct=651.622] LINEBACKER BLADES.
[ct=655.646] GREAT RECOGNITION TO GET THE
[ct=656.940] BALL OUT OF HIS HANDS QUICKLY
[ct=658.222] WITH THAT FAVORABLE MATCH UP TO
[ct=659.597] GUY.
[ct=662.247] AL: GAIN OF 23.
[ct=666.225] CHARGERS WITH THREE OF THAT.
[ct=667.663] MEANWHILE, VEGAS NOW RUNNING THE
[ct=670.278] NINTH PLAY OF THEIR OPENING
[ct=671.627] DRIVE.
[ct=674.331] FOR RUNS, FOUR PASSES.
[ct=678.285] HERE'S PASS NUMBER FIVE.
[ct=678.285] INCOMPLETE TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=680.932] ONCE THE FLAG.
[ct=682.229] DON'T GET IT.
[ct=683.600] JACOBY MYERS, SECOND DOWN.
[ct=686.229] KIRK: DAVIS AND SAN
[ct=687.579] BOTH SITTING ON THE SHORT
[ct=687.579] ROUTES.
[ct=691.571] THE SCOUTING REPORT ON O'CONNELL
[ct=692.897] IS THAT THEY DON'T GET THE BALL
[ct=694.205] DOWNFIELD A LOT.
[ct=694.205] A LOT OF IT IS UNDERNEATH.
[ct=698.175] BECAUSE OF THAT, THEY ARE
[ct=698.175] JUMPING THE ROUTES.
[ct=702.121] THE OFFICIAL TAKING A CLOSE
[ct=702.121] LOOK.
[ct=706.134] IT LOOKS LIKE HE GOT THERE EARLY
[ct=706.134] BUT IT'S NO CALL ON THE FIELD.
[ct=710.278] THAT'S WHY THEY TOOK THE SHOT TO
[ct=710.278] TUCKER ON THE SECOND PLAY OF THE
[ct=716.897] AL: SECOND AND 10.
[ct=719.536] BATTED AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=721.959] HE GOT HIS HANDS ON IT, TRYING
[ct=723.238] TO FLIP IT TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=725.751] IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 10.
[ct=729.023] MAC LEADING THE LEAGUE IN SACKS.
[ct=731.597] CROSBY IS ONLY 1.5 BEHIND HIM.
[ct=734.190] A LITTLE INDIVIDUAL DUAL
[ct=736.758] KIRK: YOU KNOW HOW FIRED UP HE
[ct=739.210] GETS ANYTIME HAS A CHANCE TO GO
[ct=740.543] UP AGAINST HIS FORMER TEAM.
[ct=743.189] IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME HE HAS
[ct=744.473] A BIG GAME AGAINST THIS
[ct=745.816] THIS OFFENSE.
[ct=749.751] AL: HAVING A GREAT SERIES.
[ct=752.055] THIRD DOWN AND 10.
[ct=757.248] O'CONNELL FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=757.248] THAT IS CAUGHT.
[ct=758.772] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=762.734] MICHAEL MAYER, THE ROOKIE OUT OF
[ct=765.363] NOTRE DAME, THEY PICKED HIM IN
[ct=767.030] THE SECOND ROUND, SETS UP A
[ct=767.030] FIRST DOWN AND
[ct=767.702] RAIDERS.
[ct=770.889] KIRK: THE MOTION BY JACOBY MYERS
[ct=773.417] WIDENS THE BACKER AND OPENS UP
[ct=773.417] THE THROW.
[ct=777.311] WATCH THE MOTION COME AND WATCH
[ct=778.636] THE BACKER RESPOND TO IT.
[ct=781.286] HE WILL END UP FLOATING OUT.
[ct=782.978] ONCE HE WIDENS, THERE'S THE
[ct=782.978] TIGHT END.
[ct=785.601] NICE JOB OF TAKING THAT SPACE.
[ct=789.680] GOOD JOB BY THE OFFENSIVE LINE
[ct=792.118] KEEPING KHALIL MACK OUT.
[ct=793.485] MUMFORD ON THE LEFT SIDE,
[ct=793.485] GETTING A LITTLE
[ct=794.838] INSIDE THERE.
[ct=801.460] INTO THE END ZONE FOR THE
[ct=801.460] TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=806.477] THE RAIDERS WHO WERE BLANKED ON
[ct=810.479] SUNDAY AND COULDN'T SCORE FOR
[ct=811.669] THE LAST THREE QUARTERS OF THEIR
[ct=814.299] GAME BEFORE THAT, ALL OF A
[ct=814.299] SUDDEN LOOK LIKE A JUGGERNAUT.
[ct=818.196] 68 YARDS.
[ct=818.196] BEAUTIFULLY EXECUTED.
[ct=824.896] KIRK: SEE HIM SAYING, NICE JOB.
[ct=827.508] THAT'S EXACTLY WHY THEY TALKED
[ct=831.528] ABOUT GETTING SHUT OUT.
[ct=832.829] THEY JUST WANTED TO GET BACK
[ct=834.130] ON THE FIELD AND HAVE A CHANCE
[ct=835.481] TO PUT POINTS UP ON THE BOARD.
[ct=838.114] THEY DO IT ON THE
[ct=839.461] FLAWLESS OPENING DRIVE.
[ct=842.152] AL: HIS SECOND YEAR OUT
[ct=843.456] THAT'S HIS FIRST CAREER
[ct=846.077] DANIEL CARLSON FOR THE POINT
[ct=846.077] AFTER.
[ct=851.438] AJ COLE IS THE HOLDER.
[ct=866.027] SO THE RAIDERS HAVE THE BALL FOR
[ct=867.370] ALMOST FIVE MINUTES.
[ct=868.662] BEAUTIFULLY EXECUTED DRIVE.
[ct=872.641] LAS VEGAS LEADS 7-0.
[ct=879.312] DEFENSIVE LINE, THE O
[ct=880.645] WHEREVER YOU NEED HIM.
[ct=883.221] KIRK: WHAT A DRIVE.
[ct=885.886] AL: FIRST TIME SINCE THE SEC
[ct=887.189] QUARTER AGAINST KANSAS CITY
[ct=887.189] THREE WEEKS AGO.
[ct=891.175] HE HAD A BYE WEEK IN BETWEEN AS
[ct=891.175] WELL.
[ct=895.171] COMING UP IN THE END ZONE IS
[ct=895.171] DERRIUS KINGS.
[ct=897.813] 21 YARD LINE.
[ct=902.988] SOME NOTES ABOUT HIM.
[ct=904.311] 49-3 WAS HIS RECORD AT NORTH
[ct=905.673] DAKOTA STATE.
[ct=908.325] FOUR-TIME FCS NATIONAL CHAMPION.

[ct=912.310] STARTER AND TO AS A BACKUP.
[ct=915.097] PICKED IN THE FIFTH ROUND IN

[ct=917.782] START.
[ct=925.758] CAN YOU IMAGINE, YOU DON'T COME
[ct=928.395] INTO A GAME FOR ALMOST FIVE
[ct=930.939] THE CATCH IS MADE ON THE
[ct=930.939] OUTSIDE.
[ct=937.609] KIRK: I'M WITH YOU.
[ct=937.609] THINK ABOUT THIS.
[ct=944.201] HIS FIRST FOUR YEARS WITH CHASE
[ct=944.201] DANIEL, THEY WERE THE BACKUP
[ct=946.778] QUARTERBACK TO JUSTIN HERBERT.
[ct=949.386] HE'S BASICALLY THE THIRD GUY.
[ct=949.386] NEVER ACTIVE.
[ct=951.985] NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT.
[ct=954.632] AND THEN HE KEEPS IN THE SHADOWS
[ct=954.632] , WORKING TO GET BETTER AS A
[ct=956.032] PASSER.
[ct=958.574] HE'S REALLY ATHLETIC,
[ct=958.574] INTELLIGENT.
[ct=961.154] IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THEY
[ct=961.154] WERE READY TO MAKE HIM THE
[ct=962.521] BACKUP THIS YEAR.
[ct=965.204] AL: RUNNING BACK IS JOSHUA
[ct=965.204] KELLEY.
[ct=970.392] HE CAN
[ct=978.225] GETS OUT OF BOUNDS AFTER HE
[ct=979.558] PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=979.558] KEPT
[ct=980.814] PICKS UP THE FIRST.
[ct=983.483] KIRK: TO A CERTAIN DEGREE, YOU
[ct=984.822] WILL HAVE TO HAVE BACKYARD
[ct=984.822] FOOTBALL TONIGHT BY STAKE.
[ct=987.398] IT'S HIS FIRST CAREER START.
[ct=990.062] HE'S BEEN IN THE LEAGUE FOR FIVE
[ct=992.766] HERE COMES THE RUSH.
[ct=994.071] NOW YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE
[ct=995.918] IMPROVISE.
[ct=998.165] INSTEAD OF THROWING IT AWAY, HE
[ct=999.424] KEEPS HIS EYES UPFIELD AND FINDS
[ct=999.424] THE TIGHT END.
[ct=1004.669] AL: FROM THE 48.
[ct=1007.343] ON THE GROUND.
[ct=1008.610] STUFFED.
[ct=1011.319] KELLY RIGHT THERE.
[ct=1016.518] DIABLO MAKING THE TACKLE.
[ct=1021.633] KIRK: WE DID OUR ZOOM THIS WEEK
[ct=1022.922] WITH EASTON STICK.
[ct=1022.922] KAYLEE ASKED HIM A QUESTION.
[ct=1025.657] BESIDE YOUR PARENTS, WHO HAS
[ct=1026.881] HELPED YOU THE MOST?
[ct=1029.553] HE BROUGHT UP HIS COLLEGE COATS
[ct=1032.271] -- COACH WHO IS THE KANSAS STATE
[ct=1034.866] ACTUALLY GOT EMOTIONAL AND
[ct=1036.211] APOLOGIZED.
[ct=1038.866] HE SAID HE INSTILLED CONFIDENCE
[ct=1041.387] IN ME AS A FRESHMAN WHEN I
[ct=1042.774] REALLY NEEDED IT.
[ct=1044.076] I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT.
[ct=1045.388] IT'S COO
[ct=1046.758] ALL THESE YEARS LATER.
[ct=1050.727] THAT BALL IS OUT.
[ct=1053.271] 42 YARD LINE.
[ct=1054.603] RAIDERS THINK THEY HAVE IT AND
[ct=1054.603] THEY DO.
[ct=1058.885] MALCOLM KOONCE COMES IN AND GETS
[ct=1060.229] THE SACK, FORCES THE FUMBLE.
[ct=1061.332] LAS VEGAS TAKES OVER.
[ct=1066.529] TYREE WILSON, ROOKIE OUT OF
[ct=1069.106] TEXAS TECH, WITH THE RECOVERY.
[ct=1072.890] KIRK: 41 ON THE BLITZ.
[ct=1074.171] THAT CREATES THE ONE-O
[ct=1075.543] OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=1078.086] GETTING BETTER AND BETTER ON THE
[ct=1078.086] OPPOSITE SIDE OF MAXX CROSBY.
[ct=1082.164] A LOT OF PEOPLE ABOUT -- WORRY
[ct=1083.477] ABOUT PUTTING TWO BLOCKERS ON
[ct=1083.477] CROSBY FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.
[ct=1087.889] NOW HAS THREE SACKS ON THE YEAR.
[ct=1087.889] FOUR TACKLES FOR A LOSS.
[ct=1091.448] HE HAS BETTER TECHNIQUE.
[ct=1092.788] ALWAYS BEEN ATHLETIC.
[ct=1095.483] PATRICK GRAHAM SAID, HE BOUGHT
[ct=1098.124] INTO THE TECHNICAL AT --
[ct=1099.480] OF BEING A PASS RUSHER IT'S
[ct=1099.480] PAYING OFF.
[ct=1103.470] AL: HE WENT TO THE SAME SCHOOL
[ct=1104.809] THAT PRODUCED KHALIL MACK
[ct=1104.809] BUFFALO.
[ct=1106.112] KIRK: NOT BAD.
[ct=1108.816] AL: MORE
[ct=1110.077] THERE HE IS.
[ct=1112.778] FORCES THE TURNOVER.
[ct=1115.425] MEANWHILE, AFTER THAT PERFECT
[ct=1116.763] FIRST DRIVE, O'CONNELL COMES
[ct=1118.062] BACK IN.
[ct=1120.520] PICKED HIM IN THE FOURTH ROUND.
[ct=1123.586] IT WAS GOING TO BE JIMMY
[ct=1123.586] GARROTTE BELOW WHO
[ct=1125.827] HE WAS GOING TO COME TO TOWN AND
[ct=1127.157] BE THE GUY.
[ct=1131.175] ZAMIR WHITE IS THE RUNNING BACK.
[ct=1136.439] TWO YARD GAIN.
[ct=1141.732] KIRK: MICHAEL MAYOR JUST GOT
[ct=1145.774] INTRODUCED TO MACK AND HOW QUICK
[ct=1145.774] HE IS.
[ct=1147.030] IT'S ONE THING TO STUDY AND HEAR
[ct=1148.413] ABOUT IT.
[ct=1151.033] NOW YOU HAVE TO TRY TO BLOCK HIM
[ct=1151.033] AND HE'S GONE.
[ct=1152.391] YOU CAN'T EVEN GET YOUR HANDS ON
[ct=1156.353] KHALIL MACK, I THINK HE'S HAVING
[ct=1157.706] ONE OF HIS BEST YEARS HE'S HAD
[ct=1158.996] IN HIS ENTIRE CAREER.
[ct=1160.360] THINK ABOUT GETT
[ct=1161.679] 10TH YEAR.
[ct=1161.679] 32 YEARS OLD.
[ct=1164.366] PEOPLE START TO THINK THAT YOU
[ct=1164.366] LOSE A LITTLE BIT.
[ct=1168.317] IN KHALIL MACK'S CASE IT’S THE
[ct=1169.668] HE'S GOTTEN BETTER.
[ct=1172.344] AL: PLAYING AGAINST THE TEAM
[ct=1172.344] THAT DRAFTED HIM.
[ct=1174.981] THAT PASS IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=1180.260] MICHAEL DAVIS IS IN AND OUT OF
[ct=1180.260] THE LINEUP.
[ct=1182.940] ADAMS LOOKING FOR A FLAG.
[ct=1182.940] DOESN'T GET IT.
[ct=1185.678] DAVIS IS A START
[ct=1187.012] BEEN INVOLVED IN
[ct=1188.338] ACTION ALREADY.
[ct=1190.969] KIRK: HE'S HAVING A FEW WORDS
[ct=1192.303] WITH ADAMS.
[ct=1193.635] ADAMS WAS WORKING THE OFFICIAL.
[ct=1194.990] HE SAID, YOU HAVE TO BEAT ME.
[ct=1197.618] DAVIS HAS THE LENGTH TO BE ABLE
[ct=1200.280] TO TRY TO STAY WITH HIM.
[ct=1201.590] THAT WAS TIGHT COVERAGE ON THE
[ct=1201.590] BACK SHOULDER FADE.
[ct=1204.269] HE WAS RIGHT THERE STRIDE FOR
[ct=1204.269] STRIDE.
[ct=1208.370] AL: THIRD AND 8.
[ct=1210.975] THE CROWD BOOING AS THEY WATCH
[ct=1212.331] THE REPLAY.
[ct=1217.660] THIRD AND EIGHT.
[ct=1220.268] THAT PASS IS CAUGHT.
[ct=1221.552] FIRST DOWN AT THE 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=1222.805] MICHAEL MAYOR.
[ct=1228.084] KIRK: RIGHT BACK TO HIM.
[ct=1229.363] HE GOT IT EARLIER ON A CRITICAL
[ct=1230.675] THIRD DOWN.
[ct=1232.043] HE COMES RIGHT BACK TO HIM.
[ct=1234.968] A GREAT MATCH AGAINST ERIC
[ct=1234.968] KENDRICKS.
[ct=1239.763] YOU FEEL THE COVERAGE.
[ct=1239.763] WORKS FROM THE OUTSIDE BACK TO
[ct=1241.068] THE INSIDE.
[ct=1242.403] THE TIMING I
[ct=1243.711] LET'S NOT FORGET TO GIVE THE
[ct=1247.687] OFFENSIVE LINE CREDIT ON THOSE
[ct=1249.019] THIRD DOWNS, GIVING THEM ENOUGH
[ct=1250.363] TIME TO EVALUATE THAT COVERAGE
[ct=1250.363] AND MAKE THE THROW.
[ct=1255.628] AL: GOOD PROTECTION.
[ct=1258.120] GOING FOR THE END ZONE.
[ct=1258.120] OPEN.
[ct=1261.888] TREY TUCKER WITH A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=1271.423] KIRK: HOW ABOUT THAT?
[ct=1275.317] ANYTIME YOU HAVE A DEEP CROSSER
[ct=1276.608] YOU NEED PROTECTION.
[ct=1277.906] THE OFFENSIVE LINE DELIVERS
[ct=1281.958] TUCKER WAS KNOWN FOR HIS SPEED
[ct=1283.264] IN COLLEGE AND THE UNIVERSITY OF
[ct=1283.264] CINCINNATI.
[ct=1284.933] HE GETS ACROSS AND HE'S ABLE TO
[ct=1285.794] PULL AWAY.
[ct=1288.430] HE'S LEAVING HIM.
[ct=1289.838] ALL OF IT BECAUSE OF THE
[ct=1291.116] OFFENSIVE LINE, GIVING HIM
[ct=1292.437] ENOUGH TIME THAT HE BOBBLED IT.
[ct=1293.781] HE DID ONCE.
[ct=1296.236] GETS THE FOOT DOWN.
[ct=1296.236] WOW.
[ct=1297.541] CLOSE.
[ct=1298.931] AL: IT’
[ct=1300.262] AL: IT'S GOOD.
[ct=1304.137] TREY TUCKER, THE ROOKIE.
[ct=1306.773] KIRK: THERE'S KHALIL MACK WITH A
[ct=1306.773] LITTLE EXTRA ATTENTION THERE.
[ct=1309.398] HELPING OUT THE RIGHT TACKLE.
[ct=1311.877] AL: TUCKER GETS HIS FIRST CAREER
[ct=1317.257] KIRK: GREAT LOOK AT IT.
[ct=1318.602] A LITTLE BOBBLE.
[ct=1319.885] IT'S LIKE THE RIGHT FOOT
[ct=1321.225] STILL BE DOWN.
[ct=1322.976] FOR THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=1325.604] AL: THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE
[ct=1326.926] DELAY ON THE EXTRA POINT.
[ct=1328.332] WAITING FOR CONFIRMATION.
[ct=1335.991] KIRK: IT'S ALL ABOUT THE RIGHT
[ct=1337.272] FOOT STILL BEING DOWN.
[ct=1338.654] DID HE LOSE POSSESSION OR REGAIN
[ct=1339.999] IT?
[ct=1341.486] >> IT IS UNDER REVIEW.
[ct=1344.043] IT.
[ct=1345.313] OK.
[ct=1346.578] ALL RIGHT.
[ct=1349.219] BACK WITH THE VERDICT AFTER
[ct=1349.219] THIS.
[ct=1357.698] THE RULING >> ON THE FIELD >>
[ct=1361.160] STANDS AS CALLED -- >> THE
[ct=1362.526] CALLED.
[ct=1365.271] AL: IT'S ABOUT AS CLOSE AS IT
[ct=1367.730] GETS TO GETTING CONTROL, GETTING
[ct=1369.045] THE RIGHT TOE DOWN.
[ct=1370.422] THE LEFT FOOT CLEARLY AND.
[ct=1373.061] THE CALL ON THE FIELD STANDS.
[ct=1379.722] SO, TWO TOUCHDOWN DRIVES ALREADY
[ct=1379.722] FOR THE RAIDERS.
[ct=1383.692] KIRK: THAT'S ONE YOU ARE GLAD
[ct=1384.979] YOU ARE NOT AT THE REPLAY BOOTH.
[ct=1386.358] THAT WAS AS CLOSE A
[ct=1387.647] I'VE SEEN IT.
[ct=1391.494] AL: EXTRA POINT.
[ct=1396.720] THAT MAKES IT 14-0.
[ct=1398.030] TAKE US THROUGH THE TOUCHDOWN
[ct=1399.369] HERE.
[ct=1404.655] >> IT'S WHEN THAT CLEAR AND
[ct=1404.655] OBVIOUS STANDARD COMES IN.
[ct=1409.014] WHEN HE GAINS FOUL CONTROL, IT
[ct=1410.380] HAS TO BE CLEAR AND OBVIOUS THAT
[ct=1410.380] THE RIGHT TO IS UP.
[ct=1413.043] IT JUST ISN'T.
[ct=1413.043] IT'S THERE.
[ct=1415.722] PROBABLY NOT.
[ct=1418.376] IT'S NOT CLEAR AND OBVIOUS THAT
[ct=1419.710] IT'S NOT A TOUCHDOWN HAS RULED
[ct=1419.710] ON THE FIELD.
[ct=1423.525] AL: WHEN IS THE LAST TIME WE SAW
[ct=1424.901] ANYTHING THAT WAS CLEAR AND
[ct=1424.901] OBVIOUS?
[ct=1432.891] TOE
[ct=1434.155] CLEARLY AND.
[ct=1440.574] KIRK: THE CHARGERS DEFENSE
[ct=1443.326] ALLOWED SIX POINTS ALL YEAR ON
[ct=1444.595] JUST OPENING DRIVES.
[ct=1444.595] THAT'S THE BEST IN THE NFL.
[ct=1449.922] THEY ARE DOWN 14-0 WITH STICK
[ct=1449.922] MAKING HIS FIRST
[ct=1451.243] WITH MAXX CROSBY ON THE OTHER
[ct=1452.575] SIDE OF THE BALL.
[ct=1456.535] AL: WITH THAT DEFENSE, HE CAME
[ct=1459.197] FROM THE RAMS WHERE HE RAN THE
[ct=1459.197] DEFENSE UNDER SEAN MCVAY.
[ct=1463.435] 29TH AND YARDS, 29TH AND
[ct=1463.435] PASSING.
[ct=1467.344] LAST WEEK, 12 POSSESSIONS, NO
[ct=1469.978] POINTS TONIGHT, TO POSSESSIONS
[ct=1469.978] FOR THE TEAM.
[ct=1475.310] HOLE.
[ct=1477.922] THEY WILL BEGIN THIS NEXT DRIVE
[ct=1477.922] FROM THE 25 YARD LINE.
[ct=1485.632] KIRK: WITH STICK AT THIS POINT,
[ct=1485.632] YOU HAVE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
[ct=1488.260] HIS ATHLETIC ABILITY.
[ct=1489.580] RUN HIM -- AT HIM INTO THE RUN
[ct=1492.608] JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE THE DEFENSE
[ct=1493.932] AWARE OF IT.
[ct=1497.955] BOOTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WERE
[ct=1497.955] HE'S REALLY COMFORTABLE.
[ct=1500.564] IT'S NOT JUST SITTING IN THE
[ct=1502.423] POCKET AND RELYING ON THE
[ct=1503.744] RUNNING GAME.
[ct=1504.978] YOU CAN DEFINITELY TAKE
[ct=1506.319] ADVANTAGE OF THIS YOUNG MAN'S
[ct=1506.319] LEGS.
[ct=1518.045] AL: STARTED ON THE GROUND.
[ct=1518.045] TO THE 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=1520.479] THAT BALL IS OUT AS WELL.
[ct=1524.395] RAIDERS THINK THEY HAVE IT.
[ct=1524.395] HERE COME THE OFFICIALS.
[ct=1528.419] OH BOY.
[ct=1532.410] JERRY TILLERY.
[ct=1535.345] ONE TIME CHARGER COMES UP WITH
[ct=1539.409] HE SAW A NIGHTMARE BEGINNING FOR
[ct=1539.409] THE CHARGERS.
[ct=1543.300] KIRK: HE GOT HIS LEFT HAND
[ct=1545.213] GOT IT LOSE.
[ct=1547.258] AS HE WAS GOING DOWN, THE BALL
[ct=1549.948] FALLS OUT OF KELLY.
[ct=1551.280] THEY FELT LIKE ISAIAH SPILLER
[ct=1552.642] MIGHT BE MOVING CLOSER TO
[ct=1553.927] BECOMING THAT SECOND BACK THIS
[ct=1556.554] NOW WITH KELLY GETTING THE
[ct=1557.779] OPPORTUNITY, THE BALL IS ON THE
[ct=1557.779] GROUND.
[ct=1561.718] THEY WENT RIGHT FOR THE CHARGERS
[ct=1561.718] HERE EARLY.
[ct=1569.818] >> -- AL: TWO TURNOVERS IN THE
[ct=1571.087] FIRST 10 AND A HALF MINUTES.
[ct=1580.406] WHITE BEHIND THE FULLBACK HERE.
[ct=1583.045] THE DRIVE STARTING FROM THE 31
[ct=1585.697] THE WHISTLE BEFORE THE SNAP.
[ct=1592.431] >> FALSE START.
[ct=1592.431] OFFENSE.
[ct=1593.775] NUMBER 16.
[ct=1597.699] AL: THE BEST THING T
[ct=1599.071] HAPPENED TO THE CHARGERS SO FAR
[ct=1603.045] JACOBY MYERS, FALSE START.
[ct=1612.262] I RAN INTO JIM PLUNKETT BEFORE
[ct=1613.570] THE GAME.
[ct=1618.819] IT LOOKS LIKE HE WILL PICK UP
[ct=1620.075] RAIDERS OF YOUR.
[ct=1623.131] KIRK: THIS IS A TEAM THAT DIDN'T
[ct=1623.131] SCORE LAST WEEK.
[ct=1629.497] 29 YARD LINE.
[ct=1633.477] TUCKER JUST SCORED THE
[ct=1635.002] TOUCHDOWN, MAKING THE GRAB HERE.
[ct=1636.378] KIRK: WHAT YOU ARE SEEING FROM
[ct=1641.644] O'CONNELL, WHEN HE HAS TIME TO
[ct=1642.962] THROW AND HIS FEET ARE SET AND
[ct=1644.319] THINGS ARE CLEAN, THE BALL C
[ct=1645.661] OUT.
[ct=1647.014] IT'S ACCURATE.
[ct=1652.294] HERE'S A GUY THAT DIDN’T START
[ct=1652.294] UNTIL HIS SENIOR YEAR IN HIGH
[ct=1653.663] SCHOOL.
[ct=1657.614] AND/OR NINTH STRING.
[ct=1665.469] HERE HE IS AS A ROOKIE.
[ct=1669.481] AL: IT'S BEEN SIX YEARS.
[ct=1669.481] HE HAD ONE HEAD COACH.
[ct=1670.766] COMES HERE.
[ct=1674.774] FIRES THE HEAD COACH HALFWAY
[ct=1674.774] THROUGH THE SEASON.
[ct=1682.128] LOUISVILLE.
[ct=1683.438] 28 STARTS.
[ct=1685.523] HE TALKED ABOUT ALL THOSE REPS
[ct=1685.523] HE RECEIVED.
[ct=1689.480] ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES.
[ct=1689.480] THEY THREW THE BALL 40 TIMES
[ct=1690.769] AGAIN.
[ct=1694.704] REALLY ALLOWED HIM TO TRANSITION
[ct=1694.704] INTO THIS NFL SYSTEM.
[ct=1698.649] OBVIOUSLY MOVING FAST.
[ct=1700.013] HE IS STILL LEARNING ABOUT THE
[ct=1700.013] NFL WINDOW.
[ct=1701.268] MUCH BETTER.
[ct=1705.332] A SHOT OF JIMMY GARROTTE BELOW
[ct=1705.332] ON THE SIDELINE.

[ct=1727.606] IN ON ANOTHER TURNOVER.
[ct=1730.285] THREE TOUCHDOWN LEAD FOR VEGAS.
[ct=1735.346] KIRK: ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE
[ct=1736.374] CATCH BY MYERS.
[ct=1740.376] WHEN HE GETS HIS FEET SET, YOU
[ct=1741.710] GIVE YOUR RECEIVER A CHANCE.
[ct=1745.409] MICHAEL DAVIS HAS BEEN PICKED ON
[ct=1745.409] A LOT THIS YEAR.
[ct=1746.710] WATCH HIM PEEK BACK.
[ct=1749.245] LOOKING OVER HIS RIGHT SHOULDER
[ct=1749.245] RIGHT THERE.
[ct=1751.941] THAT'S WHERE HE LOST THE PLAY.
[ct=1753.208] MYERS GOES RIGHT BY HIM.
[ct=1755.826] HE MADE THAT MISTAKE AND IT COST
[ct=1759.794] AL: COMES OVER FROM NEW ENGLAND.
[ct=1759.794] FIRST YEAR HERE.
[ct=1762.826] SEVENTH TOUCHDOWN OF THE SEASON.
[ct=1764.158] WHO ARE THESE GUYS?

[ct=1797.605] GREAT CATCH BY THE FORMER
[ct=1798.847] PATRIOT JACOBY MYERS.
[ct=1808.200] KIRK: THAT'S WHY THEY PLAYS --
[ct=1808.200] PLAY THESE GAMES.
[ct=1810.845] THE RAIDERS HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS
[ct=1812.174] AT -10.
[ct=1813.476] THOSE TURNOVERS H
[ct=1814.820] POINTS.
[ct=1821.041] WE GO TO KAYLEE.
[ct=1825.024] KAYLEE: MYERS TOLD ME THAT WHEN

[ct=1830.333] HE FIGURED IT WAS A MATTER OF
[ct=1831.668] TIME BEFORE HE'D GET THE
[ct=1832.994] OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW IT.
[ct=1835.635] HE SAYS, O'CONNELL HAS SHOWN HOW
[ct=1838.247] MENTALLY STRONG HE IS AS HE'S

[ct=1848.947] A NIGHTMARES AS FAR FOR T
[ct=1850.262] CHARGERS.
[ct=1850.262] STARTING FROM THE 27 YARD LINE.
[ct=1854.192] ECKLER IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=1858.198] GAVE IT TO HIM.
[ct=1858.198] REVERSES HIS DIRECTION.
[ct=1859.556] 31.
[ct=1860.895] YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY DRAFT
[ct=1863.434] O'CONNELL -- FLAG DOWN HERE.
[ct=1865.940] OFFENSIVE BACKFIELD.
[ct=1868.883] PICKED IN THE FOURTH ROUND OUT
[ct=1870.214] OF PURDUE.
[ct=1872.820] >> HOLDING.
[ct=1875.501] NUMBER 77.
[ct=1880.815] AL: WHEN THEY DRAFTED HIM,
[ct=1882.189] GARROTTE BELOW WILL BE THE GUY.
[ct=1883.474] THEY ALREADY DEALT CAR TO NEW
[ct=1884.830] ORLEANS.
[ct=1886.159] GARROTTE BELOW, THEY GET HIM
[ct=1887.447] FROM SAN FRANCISCO.
[ct=1888.815] BRIAN HOYER IS GOING TO BE THE
[ct=1888.815] BACKUP.
[ct=1892.792] THERE'S GARROTTE BELOW.
[ct=1899.996] KIRK: HE GOES FROM THREE TO
[ct=1901.987] GETTING A START WEEK FOR WHICH I
[ct=1903.262] THINK SHOCKED HIM.
[ct=1903.262] THEN HE GOES BACK TO BEING
[ct=1904.645] THREE.
[ct=1905.958] THEN EVENTUALLY WORKS HIS
[ct=1907.284] TO BEING A BACKUP.
[ct=1909.931] THEY FIRE JOSH MCDANIELS AND HE
[ct=1909.931] TAKES OVER.
[ct=1913.885] AL: TONIGHT HE'S ON FIRE.
[ct=1915.258] EVERETT MAKES THE GRAB.
[ct=1916.597] THE BALL IS OUT AGAIN.
[ct=1919.380] THIS TIME, FORTUNATELY FOR THE
[ct=1920.755] CHARGERS, THEY RECOVER.
[ct=1924.728] KIRK: I THINK HE WAS DOWN.
[ct=1931.350] ATTACKING THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=1934.070] AL: THEY CALLED IT A FUMBLE.
[ct=1936.652] THAT'S WHAT TORBERT JUST SAID.
[ct=1940.686] KIRK: LET'S TAKE A PEEK OF THAT.
[ct=1943.195] AL: EITHER WAY, THEY KEEP
[ct=1944.514] POSSESSION.
[ct=1947.198] HE'S HAD A GREAT SEASON.
[ct=1951.160] SECOND DOWN AND 10.
[ct=1954.187] HERE'S EVERETT.
[ct=1955.450] HE'S GOT BLOCKING IN FRONT.
[ct=1958.176] GOOD STEP.
[ct=1959.882] HE PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1967.452] FRUSTRATION.
[ct=1970.072] KIRK: YOU CAN SENSE THAT.
[ct=1972.518] HE ENDED UP THROWING A ROBERTSON
[ct=1973.886] -- THROWING ROBERTSON.
[ct=1975.164] THE HELMET AND ARM.
[ct=1975.164] ALL THE MOMENTUM.
[ct=1977.815] JUST OVERPOWERS HIM.
[ct=1980.510] THAT GAVE HIM THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1981.854] IT'S BEEN THAT KIND OF YOUR FOR
[ct=1983.143] A LOT OF FRUSTRATION.
[ct=1993.730] AL: GOING TO HIS LEFT.
[ct=1995.113] HE THROWS.
[ct=1996.413] SHAKES IT OFF UNDERNEATH.
[ct=2000.388] BANGED OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=2000.388] SO SMART.
[ct=2004.389] SECOND-YEAR GUY OUT OF OLD
[ct=2004.389] DOMINION.
[ct=2008.421] KIRK: THE OFFENSIVE COURT NADER
[ct=2011.052] WHO CAME OVER FROM DALLAS, YOU
[ct=2012.331] SAW THE SCREEN TO EVERETT.
[ct=2013.668] GET THE BALL OUT, TRY TO TAKE
[ct=2017.665] ADVANTAGE OF THE PASS RUSH OF
[ct=2017.665] CROSBY AND COMPANY.
[ct=2020.256] THIS TIME, THEY USE HIS ATHLETIC
[ct=2022.906] ABILITY TO GET YOU DON'T WANT
[ct=2024.215] HIM SITTING BACK IN THE POCKET.
[ct=2024.215] HE’
[ct=2026.024] HE'S A SITTING DUCK.
[ct=2033.990] AL: CHOKING AHEAD FOR
[ct=2035.297] YARD AND A HALF AND SETTING UP A
[ct=2037.998] THIRD DOWN IS AUSTIN EKELER.
[ct=2041.973] KIRK: LET'S SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO
[ct=2043.215] HERE ON THE THIRD DOWN.
[ct=2044.600] HIS LEGS COULD BE A FACTOR HERE
[ct=2045.949] AS FAR AS MOBILITY AND HIS
[ct=2049.948] ABILITY TO IMPROVISE.
[ct=2052.566] WHEN A QUARTERBACK IS MAKING HIS
[ct=2053.913] FIRST START, YOU HAVE TO PICK UP
[ct=2055.496] THE FIRST DOWN AND YOU HAVE TO
[ct=2058.121] JUST STICK WITH WHAT YOU SAW
[ct=2060.670] MIGHT BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY.
[ct=2063.282] YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT TO GET
[ct=2064.635] INTO THESE PASSING GAMES.
[ct=2072.525] AL: INTO THE CORNER APPROACHING
[ct=2073.870] THIRD AND 5.
[ct=2075.176] LOOK OUT.
[ct=2076.512] SAC.
[ct=2077.839] THAT'S THE WAY THE FIRST QUARTER
[ct=2081.792] WILL AND, ON A SACK.
[ct=2087.133] 21-0 RAIDERS AFTER ONE.
[ct=2091.152] NOW A SPECIAL LOOK AT DOOM PART
[ct=2091.152] TWO.
[ct=2102.605] AL: BACK IN VEGAS ON THURSDAY
[ct=2103.990] NIGHT.
[ct=2107.357] THE RAIDERS HAVE NOT DONE MUCH
[ct=2110.001] WINNING OVER THE LAST FEW
[ct=2110.808] DECADES BUT THEY LOOK FANTASTIC
[ct=2117.662] MEMORIAL BROWN DAVIS FROM
[ct=2118.892] OAKLAND IN 2020.
[ct=2120.535] MARK DAVIS RUNNING THE
[ct=2121.051] OPERATION.
[ct=2125.273] A PUNT OFF THE FOOT OF JK SCOTT
[ct=2128.443] AND CARTER BACK TO THE RECEIVING
[ct=2131.312] SIDE OF THE 15 YARD LINE.
[ct=2139.961] FAIR CATCH CALLED FOR, MADE AT
[ct=2140.442] THE 17 YARD LINE.
[ct=2146.935] KIRK: WE WONDERED HOW THE
[ct=2149.218] OFFENSIVE LINE WOULD HOLD UP
[ct=2151.175] WITHOUT JOSH JACOBS ABLE TO RUN
[ct=2155.324] THE BALL WITH THEY HOLD UP PASS
[ct=2155.324] PROTECTION?
[ct=2160.426] THEY HAD SEVEN SACKS, SIX BY MAC
[ct=2162.263] ALONE AND THEY ARE GIVING TIME
[ct=2166.502] TO GO DOWN FIELD, THEY'VE HIT
[ct=2166.869] BIG PLAYS DOWNFIELD.
[ct=2169.991] SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN MISSING
[ct=2170.201] FOR THE OFFENSE.
[ct=2173.894] AL: 21 IN THE FIRST QUARTER AND
[ct=2177.718] STARTING AT THE 18 YARD LINE
[ct=2180.406] THEY'VE HAD EIGHT FIRST DOWNS
[ct=2181.734] AND 141 YARDS.
[ct=2192.315] NOT MUCH THERE.
[ct=2196.307] MAKING THE TACKLE ON WHITE.
[ct=2202.927] KIRK: FIRST TIME IN HIS CAREER
[ct=2204.293] AS A COACH.
[ct=2205.596] IMAGINE MIDSEASON TRYING TO PICK
[ct=2205.596] THAT UP.
[ct=2210.879] HE SAID THE GREATEST THING WITH
[ct=2212.291] O'CONNELL IS HE HANDLES
[ct=2212.291] EVERYTHING AT THE LINE OF
[ct=2214.938] SCRIMMAGE AND HE CALLED UP MIKE
[ct=2217.724] AND THE DEFENSE MOVES AROUND.
[ct=2220.365] HE IS IN COMMAND AND THAT HELPS
[ct=2225.719] THE OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=2227.017] IN COMMAND, HELPING OUT.
[ct=2229.633] AL: JAMES.
[ct=2235.853] LOOK OUT FROM BEHIND, MACK
[ct=2237.183] ALMOST HAD THE SACK.
[ct=2243.821] MCDANIELS THE HEAD COACH, THEY
[ct=2243.821] FIRED HIM.
[ct=2245.180] THEY FIRED MCCLUNG VARDY.
[ct=2251.772] HE HAS BEEN CALLING PLAYS FROM
[ct=2253.130] THE FIELD AND IS UPSTAIRS FOR
[ct=2254.482] I THINK HE WILL STAY THERE.
[ct=2259.971] KIRK: I ASKED HIM LAST NIGHT DO
[ct=2261.238] YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE?
[ct=2263.885] HE SAID I LEARNED ON THE FLY,
[ct=2265.240] I'M LEARNING SOMETHING NEW EVERY
[ct=2267.855] WEEK AND SO FAR I HAVE NOT RUN
[ct=2269.242] OUT OF TIME.
[ct=2273.246] THE RHYTHM HAS GONE WELL AND IT
[ct=2277.199] HELPS HAVING A CEREBRAL GUY EVEN
[ct=2277.199] THOUGH HE IS A ROOKIE.
[ct=2283.743] AL: VEGAS TAKES A TIMEOUT, SO
[ct=2290.366] O'CONNELL -- TAKE A LOOK AT HIS
[ct=2290.366] STORY FROM OMAHA, NEBRASKA.
[ct=2298.661] HE WAS A WALK AT PURDUE, STARTED
[ct=2298.661] 32 GAMES OVER SIX SEASONS.
[ct=2303.924] GREW UP IN CHICAGO, SEVENTH
[ct=2305.286] CAREER START TONIGHT.
[ct=2307.977] IN AND OUT OF THE STARTING
[ct=2307.977] LINEUP.
[ct=2314.624] FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON AND
[ct=2316.383] BE THE GUY ALL THE WAY TO THE
[ct=2316.383] END.
[ct=2321.374] KIRK: HE WAS LOOKING TENTATIVE
[ct=2322.720] LAST WEEK, UNSURE.
[ct=2326.597] TONIGHT HE HAS A GUNSLINGER
[ct=2326.597] MENTALITY.
[ct=2330.569] HE'S GOT THE RIGHT MINDSET FOR A
[ct=2335.884] YOUNG QUARTERBACK TO DEAL WITH
[ct=2335.884] ADVERSITY SAYS A LOT ABOUT HIM.
[ct=2339.890] AL: THIRD AND 10 DEEP IN THE
[ct=2345.684] POCKET, CAUGHT AND SHORT OF THE
[ct=2351.056] FOURTH AND TO AND THEY SEND IN
[ct=2352.398] THE PUNT GROUP.
[ct=2357.659] KIRK: WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT TO
[ct=2360.342] THE RAIDERS HAVE TO DO AND I
[ct=2361.631] SAID MAXX CROSBY AND COMPANY
[ct=2364.452] HAVE TO HAVE THEIR OWN OFFENSE
[ct=2367.080] AND NOW YOU ARE SEEING THEM
[ct=2369.636] HAVING TO WORK FROM DEEP IN
[ct=2369.636] THEIR OWN TERRITORY.
[ct=2372.378] CHARGERS SHOULD HAVE DECENT
[ct=2372.378] FIELD POSITION.
[ct=2376.378] AL: AJAY'S NET AVERAGE IS THE
[ct=2381.634] BEST IN THE LEAGUE AT WEEK 15.
[ct=2385.623] THROWING HAND.
[ct=2388.332] HE BROKE THE BONE OF HIS INDEX
[ct=2392.308] FINGER, THE MOST IMPORTANT
[ct=2393.618] FINGER FOR A QUARTERBACK.
[ct=2396.294] HE HAD PINS INSERTED TO
[ct=2396.294] STABILIZE IT.
[ct=2400.262] BRANDON DALEY SAID THERE IS NO
[ct=2401.594] WILL TAKE SIX WEEKS.
[ct=2405.829] AL: THEY NEED HIM, THE FRANCHISE
[ct=2407.100] QUARTERBACK AT THE END OF HIS
[ct=2407.100] ROOKIE CONTRACT.
[ct=2411.136] FOR 20 MINUTES HE WAS THE
[ct=2412.447] HIGHEST-PAID GUY IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=2415.182] HE IS DONE FOR THE SEASON.
[ct=2420.430] ISAIAH SPILLER IS THE RUNNING
[ct=2420.430] BACK, FIRST TIME YOU'VE SEEN
[ct=2423.332] THERE IS A FLAG.
[ct=2431.177] >> INFRACTION DEFENSE, FIVE YARD
[ct=2432.510] PENALTY, FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2439.174] AL: HERBERT CAME ON AS A ROOKIE
[ct=2439.174] IN 2020.
[ct=2443.070] TAYLOR WAS GOING TO BE THE
[ct=2451.054] HE DID NOT MISS ANY GAMES.
[ct=2453.755] FRACTURED HIS FINGER ON HIS
[ct=2455.057] NON-THROWING HAND.
[ct=2460.364] FIRST AND FIVE, THAT IS ISAIAH
[ct=2464.336] SPILLER OUT OF TEXAS A AND M.
[ct=2469.656] KIRK: YOU BUILD YOUR FRANCHISE
[ct=2470.994] AROUND HIM AND YOU SEE SOME
[ct=2473.635] MOVES THAT THE FRANCHISE MAKES,
[ct=2474.956] WHAT THEY DO TO TRY TO HELP HIM.
[ct=2477.553] THE PLAYERS AROUND HIM, YOU'VE
[ct=2480.221] GOT DECISIONS TO MAKE.
[ct=2484.322] HERBERT IS A GREAT PLAYER BUT
[ct=2485.560] THE OFFENSE HAS STRUGGLED.
[ct=2488.244] THEY CANNOT RUN THE BALL.
[ct=2492.227] ECKLER HURT HIS ANKLE, THE
[ct=2493.539] GENERAL MANAGER IS LOOKING ON.
[ct=2498.872] THEY ARE 0-13 ON THIRD DOWN.
[ct=2501.177] AL: CAN HE GET THE FIRST DOWN?
[ct=2502.502] YES HE CAN.
[ct=2510.853] KIRK: THE LAST THING I WILL SAY,
[ct=2514.841] HE IS 30-32 AS A STARTING
[ct=2516.220] QUARTERBACK SO THE CHARGERS HAVE
[ct=2519.150] NOT CAPITALIZED IN THE FIRST
[ct=2521.825] FIVE-YEAR YEAR WINDOW WITH HIM
[ct=2523.133] AND THEY'VE GOT TO MAKE
[ct=2524.476] DECISIONS AROUND HIM TO GET
[ct=2527.123] BETTER UP FRONT AND BETTER
[ct=2529.799] SKILLS WISE TO BUILD FOR THE
[ct=2532.432] FUTURE.
[ct=2533.799] THE MIDDLE PART OF HIS CAREER
[ct=2535.061] AND BEYOND.
[ct=2539.059] AL: THE CHARGERS HAVE A LOT OF
[ct=2540.399] DECISIONS WHEN THE SEASON ENDS.
[ct=2544.197] A TIMEOUT IS CALLED HERE.
[ct=2550.066] THE NARRATIVE HAS BEEN A LOT OF
[ct=2552.681] PEOPLE BOUGHT THIS TEAM HAD A
[ct=2552.681] CHANCE TO GO TO THE SUPER BOWL
[ct=2554.080] THIS YEAR.
[ct=2556.668] THEY LOST THEIR FIRST TWO GAMES,
[ct=2559.381] WHEN THE NEXT TWO, THEN LOSE,
[ct=2563.287] THEN WHEN SO THEY ARE 4-4 AT THE
[ct=2563.287] HALFWAY MARK OF THE SEASON.
[ct=2568.629] KIRK: FIVE LOSSES, THINK HOW
[ct=2571.743] DIFFERENT THE SEASON COULD BE,
[ct=2573.046] FIVE LOSSES WITH THREE POINTS OR
[ct=2573.046] LESS.
[ct=2577.039] THEY'VE GOT TO WONDER HOW DO WE
[ct=2577.039] KEEP LOSING GAMES?
[ct=2581.006] THEY ARE PLAYING WELL ENOUGH TO
[ct=2582.316] WIN BUT IN THE FOURTH
[ct=2583.855] THE BALL BOUNCES THE WRONG WAY
[ct=2586.433] AND THEY FIND THEMSELVES 5-8.
[ct=2589.141] WINS.
[ct=2593.120] AL: THEY'VE LOST MORE GUT
[ct=2594.407] WRENCHING GAMES AND ANY TEAM
[ct=2597.075] OVER THE PAST TWO AND A HALF
[ct=2597.075] DECADES.
[ct=2598.398] A WHOLE LITANY.
[ct=2602.399] DECADES, EXACTLY RIGHT AND I
[ct=2602.399] MEANT THAT.
[ct=2607.734] FROM THE 33.
[ct=2611.706] CUTTING TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=2613.045] ISAIAH SPILLER.
[ct=2620.991] TO LOSE IN HEARTBREAKING FASHION
[ct=2623.668] WOULD BE THE DEFINITION OF THAT
[ct=2625.013] IN WEBSTER'S.
[ct=2630.299] 31 GAMES DECIDED BY EIGHT OR
[ct=2633.150] FEWER POINTS IN THE RECORD WAS
[ct=2634.418] 15-16.
[ct=2637.099] SINCE 2020 16 GAMES DECIDED BY
[ct=2642.355] THREE POINTS OR LESS AND WE
[ct=2643.998] COULD GO ON BUT WE WON'T.
[ct=2647.952] SECOND DOWN AND SEVEN.
[ct=2650.650] SMITH FIRES, INCOMPLETE.
[ct=2657.234] ALEX ERICKSON, FIRST TIME
[ct=2658.607] THEY'VE LOOKED HIS WAY TONIGHT.
[ct=2661.223] HOBBS IS COVERING.
[ct=2667.858] KIRK: HOBBS WHEN HE IS HEALTHY
[ct=2669.205] IS ONE OF THE MORE TALENTED SPOT
[ct=2669.205] CORNERS.
[ct=2671.859] HE IS PHYSICAL, TOUGH.
[ct=2675.910] YOU CAN COVER HIM THE WAY YOU
[ct=2675.910] JUST SAW.
[ct=2678.463] THE TOTAL PACKAGE
[ct=2679.822] RAIDERS DEFENSE.
[ct=2683.772] AL: GREAT JOB OUT OF THE SLOT,
[ct=2686.420] THIRD DOWN AND SEVEN.
[ct=2690.412] STICK, LOOK OUT.
[ct=2694.653] UNDER PRESSURE, OUT OF THE WAY.
[ct=2699.916] THEY ALREADY HAVE A SACK
[ct=2699.916] TONIGHT, P
[ct=2701.156] ON FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=2705.193] KIRK: THEY'RE GOING UP AGAINST
[ct=2706.490] LATER ON LEFT TACKLE WHO IS
[ct=2706.490] SUPPOSED TO BE ONE OF THE BETTER
[ct=2709.145] IN PASS PROTECTION.
[ct=2714.439] HERE COMES CROSBY AROUND BUT IT
[ct=2715.825] IS ONE-ON-ONE BECAUSE YOU TRUST
[ct=2715.825] SLATER TO WIN.
[ct=2721.105] YOU'VE GOT TO WIN THE MATCHUP
[ct=2721.105] AND YOU LOSE ON THIRD DOWN.
[ct=2727.810] AL: JK SCOTT, HIS THIRD PUNT OF
[ct=2729.149] THE NIGHT.
[ct=2738.448] CARTER BACK, TAKES IT ON THE RUN
[ct=2739.932] AT THE 17 YARDO.
[ct=2742.378] FAMILIAR SHOT IN LAS VEGAS.
[ct=2746.380] KIRK: WE HAD AN ELVIS
[ct=2747.725] IMPERSONATOR THIS MORNING.
[ct=2749.092] HOW MANY ARE THERE IN VEGAS?
[ct=2754.351] AL: 6412.
[ct=2757.034] FROM THE 30 YARD LINE ON FIRST
[ct=2759.696] DOWN, O'CONNELL FIRES,
[ct=2761.028] INCOMPLETE AT THE 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=2766.318] ADAMS COVERED BY SAMUELS IN A
[ct=2766.318] ONE-ON-ONE MATCHUP.
[ct=2771.557] KIRK: IN MAN COVERAGE HE HAS
[ct=2771.557] OUTSIDE LEVERAGE.
[ct=2774.201] HE KEEPS GETTING BETTER.
[ct=2778.173] YOU SEE THE PATIENTS BY DAVANTE
[ct=2782.164] ADAMS ON THAT ROUTE, A GOOD JOB
[ct=2783.516] BY SAMUEL WORKING AROUND HIS
[ct=2786.144] BODY AND USING THEIR RIGHT HAND
[ct=2786.144] TO KNOCK THE BALL AWAY.
[ct=2792.762] HECK OF A MATCHUP WITH ADAMS,
[ct=2794.095] EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT HIM.
[ct=2796.769] AL: BIG-TIME TIME PLAYER, SECOND
[ct=2798.096] DOWN AND 10.
[ct=2802.078] AT THE FIVE IS WHITE, THIRD
[ct=2803.447] DOWN.
[ct=2811.393] TO THIS POINT, 154 TOTAL YARDS
[ct=2812.835] FOR VEGAS, 61 FOR THE CHARGERS.
[ct=2818.129] KIRK: THEY TOLD US THEY WANTED
[ct=2820.794] TO GET BACK ON THE FIELD BUT
[ct=2822.108] THEY HAVE NOT LOOKED THIS GOOD
[ct=2822.108] IN A LONG TIME.
[ct=2827.388] FIRST TWO GAMES THEY GOT WINS,
[ct=2830.045] EVERYONE'S EXCITED, THEN THEY
[ct=2830.045] LOSE A FEW.
[ct=2832.707] THEY HAVE NOT EXECUTED LIKE THIS
[ct=2836.674] AL: THIRD AND FIVE.
[ct=2843.312] SEND AN EXTRA MAN, THE PASS IS
[ct=2843.312] NOT DOWN.
[ct=2848.633] CHARGERS DEFENSE RESPONDING WITH
[ct=2848.633] ANTONIO PIERCE, INTERIM COACH.
[ct=2852.620] HE WAS THE LINEBACKER COACH.
[ct=2856.580] HOW OFTEN DOES THE LINEBACKER
[ct=2859.239] COACH GET THAT JOB?
[ct=2864.584] KIRK: TIME WILL TELL BUT I WAS
[ct=2865.986] TALKING TO JOSH JACOBS BEFORE
[ct=2871.205] THE GAME AND A LOT OF OWNERS
[ct=2873.896] HAVE BIG DECISIONS BUT JOSH SAID
[ct=2875.189] WE LOVE THAT HE'S BEEN THERE AS
[ct=2877.877] A PLAYER AND WE RESPECT HIM AS A
[ct=2879.182] COACH.
[ct=2887.153] AL: THAT BALL IS OUT AND AGAIN A
[ct=2887.153] TURNOVER!
[ct=2893.826] AJAY TURNER COMES ALONG WITH IT.
[ct=2897.821] >> FUMBLE BY THE RECEIVING TEAM.
[ct=2903.076] KIRK: AJ RIPPED IT AWAY FROM
[ct=2907.084] IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE SAW IT
[ct=2907.084] COMING AND THERE'S NO WAY IT’S
[ct=2911.043] GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN WITH
[ct=2912.374] ANOTHER TURNOVER BUT SURE ENOUGH
[ct=2913.706] HE RIPPED THE BALL AND RECOVERS
[ct=2916.381] NOW THEY GIVE O’
[ct=2917.724] NOW THEY GIVE O'CONNELL THE
[ct=2917.724] BALL.

[ct=3336.460] DOUBLES HIM, THEY GET PRESSURE
[ct=3337.795] FROM THE OTHER SIDE WHICH GIVES
[ct=3337.795] YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT HE FACES.
[ct=3343.075] THAT IMAGE KAYLEE SHOWED OF THE

[ct=4078.919] LOOKING FOR MORE, ADAMS WEAVING
[ct=4080.216] OUT OF THE 40 YARD LINE, TACKLED
[ct=4081.526] BY DAVIS.
[ct=4085.503] KIRK: I KEEP BRINGING UP HIS
[ct=4088.233] NAME AS A PLAY CALLER BECAUSE
[ct=4090.846] HE'S NEVER DONE IT AND NO ONE
[ct=4093.467] EXPECTED THIS PERFORMANCE BUT HE
[ct=4093.467] CONTINUES TO
[ct=4094.808] PERFECTLY.
[ct=4100.159] AL: FIRST DOWN, INSIDE THE 35.
[ct=4102.811] ZAMIR WHITE.
[ct=4106.797] KIRK: I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO
[ct=4109.430] MAKE UP FOR THE POINTS THAT IT
[ct=4112.072] NOT PUT UP LAST WEEK TONIGHT.
[ct=4116.051] THEY ARE IN ATTACK MODE TRYING
[ct=4117.368] TO GET TO 42.
[ct=4120.011] I DON'T THINK THEY’RE THINKING
[ct=4120.011] ABOUT A FIELD GOAL.
[ct=4125.340] AL: FILLING SOME MERCY AT THIS
[ct=4126.713] POINT AND NOT CALLING A TIMEOUT.
[ct=4133.310] FROM THE 34, INCOMPLETE.
[ct=4137.317] AND AS FATE WOULD HAVE IT WHO
[ct=4138.619] GETS THE BALL START OF THE
[ct=4138.619] SECOND HALF?
[ct=4141.301] KIRK: THE RAIDERS GET THE BALL.
[ct=4146.619] THINK ABOUT THIS, BEING IN THE
[ct=4149.250] MINDSET OF THE CHARGERS, THERE
[ct=4152.216] 5-8, THEY'VE HAD FIVE GAMES SLIP
[ct=4152.216] THROUGH THEIR FINGERS.
[ct=4157.733] THEY SHOW UP IN A BIG DIVISIONAL
[ct=4158.820] MATCHUP ON THURSDAY NIGHT ON
[ct=4160.131] NATIONAL TV AND YOU HAVE THREE
[ct=4162.776] TURNOVERS IN YOUR OWN TERRITORY,
[ct=4164.149] FOR YOUR DEFENSE IN A TOUGH SPOT
[ct=4165.416] YOUR DOWN 35.
[ct=4167.021] YOU HAVE TO GO PLAY SOME
[ct=4167.021] DEFENSE.
[ct=4170.579] AL: A GIGANTIC HEADACHE.
[ct=4177.349] ABDULLAH TRIED TO GET THE FIRST
[ct=4178.691] DOWN, KEPT ON GOING.
[ct=4182.905] GETTING UNTANGLED HERE.
[ct=4185.437] KIRK: I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE
[ct=4189.427] MARK OF A TEAM THAT IS GOING TO
[ct=4193.347] SHUT THINGS DOWN, IT SHOWS UP IN
[ct=4195.955] THEIR TACKLING AND HERE IS A
[ct=4198.613] TACKLE BY JAMES.
[ct=4199.938] LOOK AT THE EFFORT BY THE
[ct=4203.913] RAIDERS TO KEEP COMING, ANO
[ct=4205.260] THREE OR FOUR YARDS TO GET THE
[ct=4207.924] AL: THERE IS THE GANG.
[ct=4210.553] YOU GUYS ALREADY?
[ct=4214.575] KIRK: YOU'VE GOT THE SECOND
[ct=4214.575] HALF, BOYS.
[ct=4215.860] THE WHOLE SECOND HALF.
[ct=4219.838] COMING UP.
[ct=4223.842] KIRK: WERE GOING TO ROTATE AND
[ct=4225.168] THEY CAN COME UP HERE EVERY
[ct=4226.459] THIRD SERIES.
[ct=4230.418] AL: WE WILL GIVE YOU CAVIAR TO
[ct=4231.867] DINE OUT ON EVERY WEEK.
[ct=4234.396] IT IS SECOND DOWN.
[ct=4241.122] AS IT TURNS OUT IT IS SECOND AND
[ct=4253.179] >> CORRECTION, THIRD DOWN.
[ct=4258.451] AL: MAKE IT THIRD AND DOWN AS HE
[ct=4259.777] MAKES THAT CORRECTION.
[ct=4271.435] THE VISUALS SAY IT ALL EVERY
[ct=4271.435] TIME.
[ct=4275.439] TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE.
[ct=4284.711] UP THE MIDDLE, THAT IS A FIRST
[ct=4288.743] DOWN, ABDULLAH TO THE 19 YARD
[ct=4295.000] LINE AND THE RAIDERS ARE GOING
[ct=4297.649] TO FOR THE MOMENT TAKE A TIMEOUT
[ct=4304.315] BUT HE IS SAYING BASSI IS THE
[ct=4306.951] INJURED CHARGER, SO IT IS AN
[ct=4306.951] INJURY TIMEOUT.
[ct=4309.715] OF ALL THINGS.
[ct=4318.997] KIRK: HATE TO SEE IT ANYTIME A
[ct=4322.977] DEFENDER LOWERS HIS HEAD, THAT
[ct=4326.981] IS THE BIG FEAR OF POTENTIAL
[ct=4328.315] INJURY TO THE.
[ct=4332.303] AL: KAYLEE, DOWN TO YOU.
[ct=4336.232] KAYLEE: MURRAY HAS BEEN BACK ON
[ct=4336.232] THE FIELD.
[ct=4340.269] HE WAS IN THE TENT FOR SEVERAL
[ct=4342.899] MINUTES WITH THE NEUROTRAUMA
[ct=4342.899] CONSULTANT AND STAFF.
[ct=4348.061] HE HAS BEEN ON THE INJURY REPORT
[ct=4350.751] FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS.
[ct=4352.038] THEY TAPED HIM UP AND HE IS BACK
[ct=4352.038] OUT THERE.
[ct=4357.352] AL: LOOK AT HIM ALONGSIDE MAC.
[ct=4362.697] MURRAY LEADING THE TEAM IN
[ct=4367.968] TACKLES, MEANWHILE THE GOOD NEWS
[ct=4373.278] IS BASSI IS ABLE TO WALK OFF THE
[ct=4374.657] FIELD UNDER HIS OWN POWER.
[ct=4382.703] AND WITH 36 SECONDS, THE RAIDERS
[ct=4383.981] ARE LOOKING FOR MORE.
[ct=4393.272] WHAT SONG ARE YOU GOING TO SING
[ct=4393.272] IN THE SECOND HALF FOR US?
[ct=4397.314] KIRK: WE'VE GOT TO BRING ELVIS
[ct=4398.620] UP HERE.
[ct=4403.939] AL: FIRST DOWN FROM THE 20 YARD
[ct=4409.245] O'CONNELL, END ZONE, TOUCHDOWN,
[ct=4414.575] TREY TUCKER, HIS SECOND OF THE
[ct=4423.817] KIRK: WITH THE MOTION OF CARTER,
[ct=4426.538] THE DEFENDER RUNNING WITH HIM,
[ct=4427.864] O'CONNELL KNEW RIGHT AWAY HE HAD
[ct=4429.155] WHAT HE WANTED WITH MAN TO MAN
[ct=4429.155] COVERAGE.
[ct=4433.165] HIS FASTEST RECEIVER IN TUCKER
[ct=4434.562] AND LOOK AT THE CELEBRATION.
[ct=4438.425] ALL OFFENSIVE LINE DOES THEIR
[ct=4441.113] JOB, GIVING HIM ENOUGH TIME TO
[ct=4443.772] GET TO THE TOP OF THE ROUTE,
[ct=4445.064] PULLING AWAY FROM DAVIS AND HERE
[ct=4449.107] IS MACK ONE-ON-ONE, NOT ENOUGH
[ct=4451.759] TIME BUT COMFREY DOES A NICE
[ct=4453.069] JOB.
[ct=4455.724] AL: HOLDS HIM IN CHECK.
[ct=4462.312] AL: THEY WOULD STOP THE GAME,
[ct=4462.312] RIGHT?
[ct=4466.351] WE ARE IN VEGAS, THOUGH REFEREE
[ct=4467.666] STOPS THE CONTEST.
[ct=4472.994] KIRK: RAIDERS TEAM HISTORY.
[ct=4478.249] AL: TRYING TO SEE THE LAST TIME
[ct=4479.651] ANY TEAM LED BY 42 POINTS IN THE
[ct=4481.000] FIRST HALF.
[ct=4484.915] 2014, THE PACKERS AGAINST THE
[ct=4489.031] BEARS I'M TOLD WAS THE LAST TIME
[ct=4491.638] IT WAS 42-0.
[ct=4492.989] WE ARE NOT DONE YET.
[ct=4496.993] KIRK: TOUGH, MAN.
[ct=4500.895] WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THESE
[ct=4502.279] TURNOVERS AND WE ARE EXCITED TO
[ct=4504.959] SEE EASTON STICK GET HIS CHANCE
[ct=4506.262] TO MAKE HIS FIRST CAREER START
[ct=4507.603] IN FOR JUSTIN HERBERT.
[ct=4511.581] FROM THE FIRST SERIES ON, THIS
[ct=4514.230] KID HAS NOT NO WEIGHT
[ct=4515.564] CHARGERS WITH THREE TURNOVERS IN
[ct=4523.592] 21 POINTS.
[ct=4527.545] AL: MIGHT AS WELL JUST SHUT IT
[ct=4527.545] DOWN HERE.
[ct=4531.527] ISAIAH SPILLER GAINS A COUPLE.
[ct=4535.545] HERE COME THE CHARGERS.
[ct=4539.555] THE RAIDERS WILL DO ALL OF THE
[ct=4540.853] CELEBRATING AND THAT IS EXACTLY
[ct=4542.193] WHERE THEY ARE GOING.
[ct=4544.842] END OF THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=4550.159] RAIDERS STARTED HOT, HAS BEEN
[ct=4550.159] HOT.
[ct=4552.785] LET'S GO TO KAYLEE.
[ct=4557.031] HALF?
[ct=4559.471] >> THAT WAS NOT US OUT THERE.
[ct=4562.112] WE DID NOT COME READY TO PLAY.
[ct=4564.792] SECOND HALF WE GOT TO PLAY IT
[ct=4564.792] FOR PRIDE.
[ct=4567.468] WE'VE GOT TO REGROUP AND PLAY A
[ct=4568.769] BETTER SECOND HALF.
[ct=4576.724] >> WE TRAIN ALL YEAR ROUND.
[ct=4579.433] >> OH BOY.
[ct=4582.072] NIGHTMARE BEGINNING FOR THE
[ct=4584.722] >> THE
[ct=4586.052] EXECUTING.
[ct=4588.660] >> TO THE END ZONE.
[ct=4590.008] TREY TUCKER.
[ct=4595.327] ALL IN FOR THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=4595.327] JACOBY MYERS.
[ct=4598.017] CASHING IN ON ANOTHER TURNOVER.
[ct=4600.647] >> EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE
[ct=4603.256] >> WHO ARE THESE GUYS?
[ct=4608.580] AL: HALFTIME 42-0.
[ct=4613.934] KAYLEE: SUNDAY, YOU WERE SHUT
[ct=4616.590] FOUR DAYS LATER, 42 POINTS ON
[ct=4617.927] THE BOARD AFTER THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=4619.224] WHAT IGNITED THE OFFENSE?
[ct=4623.169] >> THAT'S WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.
[ct=4623.169] THAT'S WHAT WE’VE BEEN TRYING
[ct=4624.568] FOR ALL SEASON.
[ct=4627.176] KAYLEE: WHAT DID YOU TELL YOUR
[ct=4628.514] TEAM ABOUT HOW THEY APPROACH THE
[ct=4631.164] >> PRESS THE GAS PEDAL EVEN
[ct=4632.523] HARDER.
[ct=4639.119] AL: SO IT'S 42-0.
[ct=4640.506] THE RAIDERS ARE GOING TO GET THE
[ct=4640.506] BALL TO START.
[ct=4652.413] 283 YARDS FOR VEGAS IN THE FIRST
[ct=4656.456] ONLY 89 FOR L.A.
[ct=4663.034] SECOND HALF STARTS WITH THE
[ct=4663.034] TOUCHBACK.
[ct=4665.686] NOW IT'S TIME FOR TONIGHT’S
[ct=4668.399] JOURNEY, PRESENTED BY HYUNDAI.
[ct=4672.387] 42 POINT LEAD, LARGEST RAIDERS
[ct=4673.669] HALFTIME LEAD.
[ct=4676.351] SECOND LARGEST IN NFL HISTORY.
[ct=4681.832] NO SACKS TONIGHT FOR THE
[ct=4683.120] CHARGERS WHO HAD SEVEN AGAINST
[ct=4685.820] O'CONNELL IN THE FIRST GAME OF
[ct=4687.384] WEEK FOUR.
[ct=4689.940] 14 PASSES IN THE FIRST HALF,
[ct=4691.251] MOST BY ANY PLAYER THIS SEASON.
[ct=4699.207] HE STARTS HERE WITH A HANDOFF.
[ct=4704.552] ABOUT A TWO YARD GAIN THAT TURNS
[ct=4705.872] INTO A FIVE YARD GAIN.
[ct=4711.187] KIRK: THE THING THAT STOOD OUT
[ct=4711.187] TO A LOT OF PEOPLE INCLUDING
[ct=4712.530] MYSELF WITHIN THE PLAY OF THE
[ct=4715.155] OFFENSIVE LINE, I THINK JOSH
[ct=4717.828] JACOBS IS DOWN TONIGHT.
[ct=4720.469] ANDRE JAMES IS THE
[ct=4721.932] COLTON MILLER IS THE LEFT
[ct=4723.203] TACKLE.
[ct=4724.568] THEY RESHUFFLED THINGS UP FRONT.
[ct=4727.177] KHALIL MACK AND THE CHARGERS
[ct=4732.528] YOU ARE WORRIED, ARE THEY GOING
[ct=4733.872] TO BE ABLE TO RUN THE BALL?
[ct=4737.825] MAX COMING AFTER HIM AGAIN.
[ct=4740.500] COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY.
[ct=4744.470] AL: SECOND AND 6 -- 6.
[ct=4747.117] PLAY ACTION.
[ct=4748.426] UP TO THE 47 YARD LINE.
[ct=4751.117] THE HEADLINE STORY IN THE SPORTS
[ct=4752.450] SECTION OF THE JOURNAL OF VEGAS
[ct=4755.077] TODAY WAS, WHO WILL BE THE
[ct=4755.077] QUARTERBACK IN TONIGHT'S GAME?
[ct=4757.774] PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
[ct=4757.774] GARROTTE BELOW.
[ct=4760.422] KIRK: WHEN YOU COME OFF A GAME
[ct=4763.045] WHERE YOU GET SHUT OUT, THEY'VE
[ct=4765.756] LOST THREE IN A ROW.
[ct=4767.042] THE OFFENSE HAS BEEN REELING.
[ct=4769.654] IT'S ONLY NATURAL TO ASSUME, ARE
[ct=4772.372] THEY GOING TO GO BACK TO HIM?
[ct=4777.615] GIVE THE OFFENSIVE STAFF A LOT
[ct=4777.615] OF CREDIT.
[ct=4780.319] A LOT OF NEW PLAYERS BEING ASKED
[ct=4780.319] TO DO FROM THINGS.
[ct=4784.283] GIVE THEM CREDIT.
[ct=4784.283] THEY PUT TOGETHER A GOOD PLAN.
[ct=4786.936] THEY EXECUTED.
[ct=4789.679] AL: PERFECT SO FAR.
[ct=4793.655] ALL THE WAY TO THE 38 YARD LINE
[ct=4794.951] GOES ZAMIR WHITE.
[ct=4801.619] KIRK: THE OFFENSIVE LINE
[ct=4801.619] CONTINUING TO DO A GOOD JOB.
[ct=4805.611] WHITE WHO I AM FAMILIAR WITH
[ct=4807.438] BECAUSE OF HIS DAYS AT GEO
[ct=4808.661] PULLS AROUND.
[ct=4810.014] NICE BLOCK.
[ct=4812.640] YOU ALSO HAVE TO ADD THAT THE
[ct=4813.980] CHARGERS ARE JUST NOT GETTING
[ct=4813.980] OFF OF BLOCKS.
[ct=4816.627] THAT STARTED TO BECOME SOMETHING
[ct=4817.986] WE SAW FROM ABOUT THE EARLY PART
[ct=4819.257] OF THE SECOND QUARTER ON.
[ct=4823.248] CLEARLY CONTINUING HERE INTO THE
[ct=4823.248] SECOND HALF.
[ct=4828.610] AL: PLAY-ACTION.
[ct=4832.589] MOVING TO HIS LEFT, BUYING TIME.
[ct=4833.896] PASS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=4837.914] COVERED THAT
[ct=4844.532] KIRK: HE WAS SACKED SEVEN TIMES.
[ct=4845.887] SIX TIMES ALONE BY KHALIL MACK.
[ct=4848.515] FIRST TIME THEY MATCHED UP.
[ct=4852.461] THIS TIME, MAC ENDS UP GOING
[ct=4855.145] INSIDE INSTEAD OF OUTSIDE.
[ct=4857.829] THAT ALLOWED HIM TO HAVE THE
[ct=4857.829] HALF ROLLAWAY.
[ct=4860.525] GOOD JOB NOT ONLY BY
[ct=4863.110] JOHNSON ALSO GETTING INVOLVED.
[ct=4868.432] THE WHOLE KEY IS TO KEEP 52 OUT,
[ct=4869.754] IT'S WORKED.
[ct=4871.086] HE IS HAD ALL KINDS OF TIME.
[ct=4873.790] AL: GREAT TIME OF THAT TONIGHT
[ct=4875.062] ON EVERY LEVEL.
[ct=4879.082] DROPPED BY AUSTIN HOOPER.
[ct=4884.393] KIRK: AFTER THOSE SIX SACKS IN
[ct=4885.744] THE FIRST MATCH UP, YOU THOUGHT,
[ct=4888.338] MUNFORD HASN'T PLAYED A TON.
[ct=4891.021] HE'S MOVED AROUND FROM THE RIGHT
[ct=4892.337] SIDE TO THE LEFT SIDE.
[ct=4893.622] MUNFORD HAS DONE A HECKUVA JOB
[ct=4894.968] OUT OF OHIO STATE.
[ct=4897.631] HASN'T HAD A LOT OF HELP.
[ct=4901.629] I THINK THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF HAVE
[ct=4902.968] HIM THROWING THE BALL IN SUM
[ct=4904.303] LEE DOWNS.
[ct=4905.568] REALLY SMART.
[ct=4905.568] IT’
[ct=4909.586] IT'S BEEN A NICE PLAN.
[ct=4910.901] AIDAN O'CONNELL LOOKS LIKE HE’S
[ct=4912.281] VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE ATTACK
[ct=4916.030] AL: THIRD AND 10.
[ct=4919.992] 33 YARD LINE.
[ct=4922.676] THE FLAG COMING IN AT THE END OF
[ct=4923.986] THE PLAY.
[ct=4927.976] A LITTLE DRAWING GOING ON WITH
[ct=4929.285] DAVIS AND ABDULLAH.
[ct=4934.597] KIRK: HE CAME
[ct=4935.967] FACEMASK.
[ct=4937.263] THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE.
[ct=4942.588] JUSTIN HOLLINS.
[ct=4945.256] AL: THAT'S THE DISCUSSION RIGHT
[ct=4947.877] YOU CAN SEE THE MOTION BY THE
[ct=4947.877] OFFICIALS.
[ct=4951.891] TORPOR DISCUSSING IT.
[ct=4955.847] >> PERSONAL FOUL.
[ct=4961.177] NUMBER 56.
[ct=4962.548] PENALTY, 15 YARDS.
[ct=4963.856] AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4969.167] RECALL.
[ct=4970.443] RECALL ON A.
[ct=4973.131] -- EIGHT.
[ct=4975.750] CORRECTION, IT'S NUMBER 58.
[ct=4978.422] AL: THERE YOU GO.
[ct=4978.422] YEAH.
[ct=4985.122] THAT MOVES THE BALL TO THE 18
[ct=4997.083] SO WITH THAT -- WITHOUT JACOBS
[ct=4998.281] TONIGHT, THE RAIDERS HAVE RUSHED
[ct=4999.560] FOR 100 YARDS.
[ct=5006.100] A LITTLE FAKE TO THE RIGHT SIDE.
[ct=5008.933] IT GOES TO MYERS.
[ct=5011.515] THAT WILL SET UP A FIRST DOWN
[ct=5012.832] AND GOAL AT THE SEVEN YARD LINE.
[ct=5015.746] KIRK: THIS IS THE WORST RUSHING
[ct=5016.823] OFFENSE IN THE NFL.
[ct=5020.798] THEY ARE AT OVER 100 YARDS
[ct=5022.338] RUNNING A BALL AGAINST THE
[ct=5022.338] CHARGERS DEFENSE.
[ct=5024.788] WHEN YOU RUN THE FOOTBALL, IT
[ct=5026.129] ALLOWS O'CONNELL TO HAVE THE
[ct=5028.785] PLAY-ACTION OPPORTUNITIES AND
[ct=5030.095] CONTINUE TO TRY TO MIX IT UP
[ct=5031.473] INTO DO A GOOD JOB ON FIRST AND
[ct=5032.755] 10 AND TRY TO GET THE BALL OUT.
[ct=5039.645] AL: THE WORST RUSHING SITUATION.
[ct=5043.518] AND WITHOUT JACOBS.
[ct=5050.169] FIRST AND GOAL.
[ct=5054.194] O'CONNELL, CAUGHT.
[ct=5058.154] THAT WILL TAKE IT TO
[ct=5060.799] ZAMIR WHITE MAKES THE CATCH.
[ct=5063.665] SECOND DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=5072.765] KIRK: ANTONIO PIERCE, IN HIS
[ct=5072.765] MIND IT IS 00.
[ct=5076.826] HE'S LOOKING AT THIS AS AN
[ct=5078.175] OPPORTUNITY TO SHOWCASE WHAT HE
[ct=5080.793] CAN DO AS A HEAD COACH, KEEP HIS
[ct=5080.793] TEAM GOING, STAYING AGGRESSIVE.
[ct=5084.789] REALLY TESTING AS A PRO.
[ct=5087.476] YOU FIND OUT WHAT YOU ARE
[ct=5088.835] OUT OF.
[ct=5090.084] IT'S A TOUGH SET OF
[ct=5090.084] CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE CHARGERS
[ct=5091.406] TO CONTINUE TO GO OUT THERE LIKE
[ct=5098.063] AL: SECOND AND GOAL.
[ct=5102.074] MYERS IS GOING TO THROW.
[ct=5105.052] DAVANTE ADAMS HAULS IT IN.
[ct=5111.140] JACOBY MYERS, NO STRANGER TO
[ct=5112.494] THROWING THE BALL.
[ct=5112.494] HIGH SCHOOL QUARTERBACK.
[ct=5115.126] DID IT VERY OFTEN AND WITH GREAT
[ct=5116.473] SUCCESS IN NEW ENGLAND.
[ct=5118.991] TOUCHDOWN NUMBER SEVEN F
[ct=5122.985] KIRK: HE WENT ON THAT MOTION
[ct=5124.357] EARLIER WHEN HE CAME FROM THE
[ct=5124.357] LEFT.
[ct=5125.603] THIS TIME HE COMES FROM THE
[ct=5125.603] RIGHT.
[ct=5129.608] I LOVE TO WATCH THE JOB
[ct=5130.941] DAVANTE ADAMS DID IN SELLING
[ct=5133.586] YOU ARE RIGHT.
[ct=5133.586] HE LOOKED SO COMFORTABLE.
[ct=5136.467] HIS BACKGROUND OF BEING A
[ct=5141.563] DOESN'T PANIC, DOESN’T HURRY.
[ct=5141.563] BAITED THE DEFENDER.
[ct=5142.926] MADE HIM COME TO HIM.
[ct=5146.857] FELT THREATENED AND PULLED THE
[ct=5146.857] DEFENDER TO HIM.
[ct=5148.243] ADAMS IS ALL OVER IT.
[ct=5152.214] UP 42.
[ct=5153.545] AL: I KNOW.
[ct=5153.545] I KNOW.
[ct=5164.241] RAIDERS, WHAT CAN I TELL YOU.RAI
[ct=5166.924] CHARGERS GET THE BALL.
[ct=5174.958] KAYLEE: WE WERE SURPRISED WHEN
[ct=5176.311] WE SHOWED UP TO RAIDERS PRACTICE
[ct=5177.598] AND DAVANTE ADAMS WAS NOWHERE TO
[ct=5177.598] BE FOUND.
[ct=5180.283] HE COULDN'T GET OUT OF BED YET
[ct=5182.923] -- UNTIL AFTER 6:00 P.M.
[ct=5185.600] HE SAID HIS TWO DAUGHTERS WHO
[ct=5188.281] WERE BOTH UNDER FOUR JUST GOT
[ct=5189.593] OVER HAVING THE FLU AND IT HIT
[ct=5189.593] HIM NEXT.
[ct=5193.560] HE SAID IT TOOK IVS, VITAMINS,
[ct=5196.227] HYDRATION, ALL OF IT TO GET HIM
[ct=5196.227] BACK ON THE FIELD TONIGHT.
[ct=5198.875] YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW BY THE WAY
[ct=5200.208] HE'S BEEN PLAYING TONIGHT.
[ct=5202.865] AL: SEVEN CATCHES AND 94 YARDS.
[ct=5206.861] MEANWHILE, GETTING FREE IS
[ct=5206.861] JOSHUA PALMER.
[ct=5210.837] FINALLY SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENS
[ct=5210.837] TO THE CHARGERS.
[ct=5214.822] JOSH PALMER, 79 YARDS.
[ct=5217.441] AFTER MISSING FIVE GAMES AND
[ct=5220.155] HANGING HIS HEAD IS ROBERTSON.
[ct=5226.943] KIRK: WELL, ROBERTSON SHAKING
[ct=5226.943] HIS HEAD.
[ct=5229.403] IT DOES LOOK LIKE HE AND HIS
[ct=5232.114] SAFETY ARE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE.
[ct=5234.748] HERE'S THE CORNER RIGHT HERE.
[ct=5237.399] YOU SEE FIVE MOTIONING OUT.
[ct=5241.411] I THINK THAT CREATES CONFUSION,
[ct=5242.770] BY MOTIONING HIM TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=5245.503] STEVE ROBERTSON LOOKING INTO THE
[ct=5246.863] INSIDE, WONDERING WHERE THE
[ct=5248.248] SAFETY SUPPORT MIGHT BE.
[ct=5251.131] FOR THE FIRST TIME ALL NIGHT,
[ct=5252.272] THE CHARGERS ARE ABLE TO MAKE A
[ct=5253.413] BIG PLAY OFFENSIVELY.
[ct=5260.037] AL: SECOND TOUCHDOWN PASS.
[ct=5265.341] MEANWHILE, THE EXTRA POINT IS
[ct=5265.341] JUST BARELY GOOD.
[ct=5269.347] OFF THE FOOT OF CAMERON DICKER.
[ct=5273.360] 49-7.
[ct=5278.648] THE RAIDERS, WHAT HAS IT BEEN
[ct=5281.277] LIKE SINCE 2003?
[ct=5283.895] THEY WENT TO THE SUPER BOWL
[ct=5285.303] AFTER THE LOSS TO TAMPA BAY.
[ct=5290.627] THE DREW BS AT THE END.
[ct=5291.939] THEY CHANGED COACHES IN
[ct=5293.422] MIDSEASON FOUR TIMES.
[ct=5297.356] 23 STARTING QUARTERBACKS OVER
[ct=5297.356] THE LAST TWO DECADES.
[ct=5301.769] TIED FOR FOURTH MOST IN THE
[ct=5301.769] LEAGUE.
[ct=5307.063] THERE'S THE INTERNAL FLAME OF
[ct=5307.063] SORTS.
[ct=5309.685] KIRK: DEREK CARR WAS HERE NINE
[ct=5315.051] I HAD FORGOTTEN, YOU HAVE TO GO
[ct=5316.651] BACK TO RICH GANNON WHEN IT
[ct=5317.914] COMES TO QUARTERBACK PLAY WHEN
[ct=5320.579] THE RAIDERS HAD
[ct=5321.903] SUCCESS.
[ct=5321.903] THAT'S 20 YEARS AGO.
[ct=5325.934] AL: AND IT WAS THE M.V.P. OF THE
[ct=5327.173] REGULAR SEASON THAT YEAR.
[ct=5329.878] GOES TO THE PLAYOFFS, GETS TO
[ct=5332.537] THE SUPER BOWL.
[ct=5333.864] PLAYED IN SAN DIEGO.
[ct=5335.165] THAT'S THE YEAR THAT JOHN GRUDEN
[ct=5336.482] WAS TRADED TO TAMPA BAY.
[ct=5340.565] BILL CALLAHAN TAKES OVER.
[ct=5340.565] CALLAHAN GETS THE T
[ct=5341.921] SUPER BOWL.
[ct=5341.921] WHAT HAPPENS?
[ct=5345.895] THEY FACE TAMPA BAY AND THEY
[ct=5345.895] LIVE THE PARTY TROPHY.
[ct=5356.650] MEANWHILE, IN TERMS OF THE DRAFT
[ct=5359.483] AS WELL, IT'S BEEN TOUGH.
[ct=5365.046] SINCE 16, YOU HAD JOE FOR --
[ct=5366.312] JOSEPH AND CONNOLLY OUT OF THE
[ct=5371.636] RUGS AND OUR NET OUT OF THE NFL.
[ct=5374.284] WILSON IS A ROOKIE SO NOT A LOT
[ct=5375.637] OF SUCCESS WHEN IT COMES TO
[ct=5376.994] FIRST ROUND PICKS OVER THE LAST
[ct=5378.294] SEVERAL SEASONS.
[ct=5379.619] KIRK: NO.
[ct=5380.980] IT'S BEEN A DISASTER.
[ct=5383.527] A LOT OF THESE GUYS, IT'S NOT
[ct=5384.837] THAT THEY ARE ON DIFFERENT
[ct=5384.837] TEAMS.
[ct=5390.198] YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT NOT
[ct=5390.198] MID-ROUND OR LATE ROUND PICKS.
[ct=5394.151] GOING BACK SIX OR SEVEN YEARS
[ct=5394.151] AGO.
[ct=5404.737] AL: FROM THE 25.
[ct=5411.516] PICKING UP ABOUT FOUR YARDS.
[ct=5415.428] KIRK: I THINK IT'S BECAUSE WHEN
[ct=5416.768] I SEE THAT RAIDERS UNIFORM, I
[ct=5420.751] STILL THINK ABOUT JOHN MADDEN
[ct=5422.088] AND SOME OF THE GREAT TEAMS WITH
[ct=5422.088] MARCUS ALLEN.
[ct=5424.729] WHEN I LOOKED AND SAW THAT
[ct=5427.411] THEY'VE BEEN INTO PLAYOFF GAMES
[ct=5430.070] SINCE THAT SUPER BOWL, THINK OF
[ct=5431.399] SOME OF THOSE GREAT TEAMS.
[ct=5432.691] IT'S REMARKABLE TO THINK THAT
[ct=5434.079] THAT IS ALL THEY'VE HAD.
[ct=5436.673] APPEARANCES.
[ct=5440.661] AL: FRED BILETNIKOFF.
[ct=5443.410] NICE CHAT WITH THE GREAT WIDE
[ct=5443.410] RECEIVER BEFORE THE GAME
[ct=5448.703] SECOND DOWN AND 6 SAKE!
[ct=5452.665] -- YEAR -- HERE.
[ct=5459.431] DARRELL AND MONICA.
[ct=5463.464] KIRK: I THINK OF WESTERN HAYES.
[ct=5463.464] THAT WAS GREAT.
[ct=5466.070] AT THAT TIME, IN THAT ERA.
[ct=5470.012] AL: HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT
[ct=5471.239] TOOK LESTER HAYES TO CLEAN UP
[ct=5471.239] AFTER A GAME?
[ct=5475.430] IT WAS AN TO WASH OFF.
[ct=5479.437] THIRD DOWN AND 4.
[ct=5483.375] THIS IS THE FRANCHISE THAT
[ct=5484.725] STARTED THE NFL IN 1960, MOVED
[ct=5488.705] TO L.A., BACK TO OAKLAND, AND
[ct=5488.705] NOW HERE.
[ct=5491.554] THIRD AND 4.
[ct=5494.177] STEPPING UP.
[ct=5496.809] TAKEN DOWN FINALLY IN THE
[ct=5499.485] BACKFIELD IS ERIC KENDRICKS.
[ct=5500.785] ABLE TO KNOCK HIM DOWN AS HE
[ct=5502.116] TRIED TO ESCAPE.
[ct=5502.116] IT'S FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=5507.533] KIRK: THIS IS SET UP BY KENT
[ct=5507.533] MURRAY.
[ct=5511.504] WATCH WHAT HE DOES.
[ct=5512.805] ALMOST LIKE SETTING A PICK ON
[ct=5515.510] THIS PASS PROTECTION.
[ct=5516.797] IT ALLOWS KENDRICKS TO COME OFF
[ct=5518.163] OF HIS GUY AND EVENTUALLY GET
[ct=5520.773] THAT'S PARTNERS WORKING
[ct=5524.768] TOGETHER, BRINGING LINEBACKERS,
[ct=5526.126] OCCUPYING THE LEFT GUARD, AND
[ct=5526.126] GETTING THE SACK.
[ct=5530.094] AL: LINE DRIVE KICK.
[ct=5534.083] BOUNCING.
[ct=5536.737] PICKED UP INSIDE THE 10 YARD
[ct=5539.430] SMOTHERED.
[ct=5548.713] 8:13 REMAINING IN THE THIRD.
[ct=5551.368] I'M TERRIBLE BUT I LIKE TO
[ct=5556.633] AL: YOU DON'T HIT ON LIKE 19.
[ct=5559.322] KIRK: NO NO.
[ct=5559.322] I KNOW WHEN TO GET UP AND GO TO
[ct=5560.615] BED.
[ct=5561.990] I'M GOOD AT THAT.
[ct=5563.273] AL: AS SOON AS WE GET
[ct=5564.614] THE HOTEL.
[ct=5565.981] FROM THE 10 YARD LINE.
[ct=5568.588] NO PLACE TO REALLY GO.
[ct=5572.481] SECOND DOWN.
[ct=5577.821] KIRK: DAVIS HAD A RUT -- ROUGH
[ct=5579.123] THE ROOKIE HAD THE FUMBLE DEEP
[ct=5580.492] IN HIS OWN TERRITORY.
[ct=5583.112] THIS TIME, HE PUTS THEM IN A
[ct=5584.440] TOUGH SPOT HERE.
[ct=5588.650] AL: THE LAST PUNT BY COAL.
[ct=5592.576] LEADS THE LEAGUE.
[ct=5592.576] 65 YARDS.
[ct=5597.965] 83 YARD
[ct=5601.922] SECOND DOWN AND 6.
[ct=5607.234] THIRD DOWN AND 5.
[ct=5611.142] KIRK: LET'S LOCK IN ON 98 HERE.
[ct=5613.843] THEY WILL MOVE HIM AROUND.
[ct=5619.126] A LOT OF TIMES, HE IS SET UP TO
[ct=5620.483] THE RIGHT, COMING OFF THE EDGE.
[ct=5623.084] LET'S SEE IF THE CHARGERS WILL
[ct=5624.495] DOUBLE-TEAM HIM OR LEAVE HIM ON
[ct=5625.825] AN ISLAND.
[ct=5631.121] AL: HALFWAY MARK OF THE THIRD.
[ct=5643.035] THE THROW IS CAUGHT BUT SHORT.
[ct=5648.412] CANNOT GET FREE.
[ct=5648.412] TACKLED BY JACK JONES.
[ct=5652.395] KIRK: WATCH THIS MOVE TO THE
[ct=5655.026] INSIDE AND THEN THE SPIN MOVE
[ct=5655.026] OFF OF THAT.
[ct=5657.630] IT'S JUST UNFAIR.
[ct=5661.634] DIPS INSIDE, GETS THE BIG TACKLE
[ct=5664.283] , 320 POUNDS INSIDE, OFF
[ct=5665.648] BALANCE.
[ct=5665.648] THEN SPINS OUT OF THAT.
[ct=5668.550] HE FORCES THE BALL OUT QUICK.
[ct=5670.952] JUST AS USEFUL.
[ct=5672.081] THAT GUY IS GREAT.
[ct=5677.368] AL: SCOTT WITH HIS FIFTH PUNT OF
[ct=5681.363] HI, BOOMING KICK.
[ct=5682.808] FAIR CATCH.
[ct=5689.395] 6:30 TO GO IN THE THIRD.
[ct=5693.302] 60 YARDS.
[ct=5698.665] 49ERS AND RAVENS CONTROL HALF OF
[ct=5698.665] THE TOP
[ct=5699.940] CONFERENCE.
[ct=5701.311] THOSE TWO TEAMS WILL MEET ON
[ct=5702.640] CHRISTMAS DAY.
[ct=5705.272] KIRK: RAVENS HAVE MIAMI AND SAN
[ct=5706.629] FRANCISCO.
[ct=5709.486] AL: EAGLES CONTROLLING THE PATH
[ct=5710.624] TO THE DIVISION TITLE.
[ct=5714.571] ONLY TWO OF 32 TEAMS HAVE BEEN
[ct=5717.213] ELIMINATED FROM CONTENTION.
[ct=5718.799] PATRIOTS AND PANTHERS.
[ct=5721.196] THESE TWO TEAMS STILL
[ct=5721.196] MATHEMATICALLY ALIVE.
[ct=5726.507] 30 TEAMS STILL MATHEMATICALLY
[ct=5726.507] ALIVE.
[ct=5731.833] THE PLAYOFF PICTURE AS IT LOOKS
[ct=5735.788] RIGHT NOW IN THE AMERICAN
[ct=5739.770] BALTIMORE, MIAMI, KANSAS CITY,
[ct=5741.147] AND JACKSONVILLE.
[ct=5743.797] DIVISION LEADERS IF THE SEASON
[ct=5743.797] STOP RIGHT NOW.
[ct=5747.757] INDIANAPOLIS WOULD BE AN AS
[ct=5747.757] WILDCARDS.
[ct=5750.420] ONLY THE TOP SEED GETS A BUY.
[ct=5753.089] KIRK: WHAT A RACE TO SEE WHO
[ct=5754.397] WILL GET THE NUMBER ONE OVERALL
[ct=5755.758] SEED IN THE NFC.
[ct=5758.415] DON'T FORGET MIAMI AND BALTIMORE
[ct=5758.415] PLAY EACH OTHER.
[ct=5761.056] KANSAS CITY, THERE'S A
[ct=5762.366] GAMES.
[ct=5763.673] AL: GOOD.
[ct=5766.319] MET -- PRESSURE.
[ct=5770.348] IN THE OTHER CONFERENCE, -- THAT
[ct=5773.018] TIME THE PRESSURE WAS PUT ON BY
[ct=5773.018] AUSTIN JOHNSON.

[ct=5777.039] DALLAS RIGHT NOW.
[ct=5782.272] DETROIT AND TAMPA BAY DESPITE A
[ct=5782.272] 6-7 MARK.
[ct=5783.654] YOU HAVE THE EAGLES,
[ct=5784.963] VIKINGS, THE PACKERS GOING TO
[ct=5791.630] KIRK: NFC SOUTH, EVERY YEAR IT
[ct=5791.630] IS LIKE THAT.
[ct=5794.222] WE HAVE THE SAINTS NEXT WEEK IN
[ct=5795.604] LOS ANGELES.
[ct=5800.890] AL: RAMS HAVE WASHINGTON AT
[ct=5802.227] HOME.
[ct=5808.833] IT'S CAUGHT.
[ct=5811.555] MICHAEL MAYER, TOUCHDOWN
[ct=5811.555] EARLIER.
[ct=5814.139] MAKES HIS FOURTH CATCH OF THE
[ct=5818.168] KIRK: EVEN AS A FRESHMAN IN
[ct=5819.449] COLLEGE, HE LOOKED LIKE THAT.
[ct=5822.148] HE SHOWED UP ABOUT 250 POUNDS.
[ct=5824.781] JUST ONE OF THOSE GUYS THAT FOR
[ct=5827.467] THREE YEARS IN SOUTH BEND, YOU
[ct=5828.738] THOUGHT, WHERE IS HE GOING TO GO
[ct=5828.738] IN THE NFL?
[ct=5831.427] NOW THAT HE'S HAD A CHANCE TO
[ct=5834.088] GET USED TO THIS SYSTEM AND
[ct=5838.039] SPEED AND THE COMPLEXITY OF NFL
[ct=5840.725] DEFENSES, SEEMS TO BE TRENDING
[ct=5842.077] IN A GREAT DIRECTION WITHIN THE
[ct=5842.077] OFFENSIVE STRUCTURE.
[ct=5846.060] HE'S A REAL WEAPON IN THE
[ct=5846.060] MIDDLE.
[ct=5851.381] AL: O'CONNELL ROLLING.
[ct=5851.381] KEEPS HIS EYES DOWNFIELD.
[ct=5855.387] I SEE A GUY WEARING NUMBER 87
[ct=5857.989] DAVE CASPER.
[ct=5859.305] THE GHOST.
[ct=5859.305] GHOST TO THE POST.
[ct=5860.644] THE HOLY ROLLER.
[ct=5864.639] THESE TWO TEAMS THROUGH THE
[ct=5869.987] YEARS, WHAT TOOK YOU GUYS SO
[ct=5869.987] LONG?
[ct=5875.268] INTO THE GAME AGAINST SAN DIEGO.
[ct=5875.268] KIRK: WERE YOU
[ct=5876.545] GAME?
[ct=5877.950] AL: NO.
[ct=5881.931] THE BALL IS MOVED FORWARD.
[ct=5884.559] WINDS UP IN THE HANDS OF CASPER
[ct=5887.237] CREATED A RULES CHANGE.
[ct=5889.908] KIRK: HE KICK THAT BALL ABOUT 10
[ct=5891.172] YARDS.
[ct=5892.545] AL: LEAVE IT TO THE RAIDERS IN
[ct=5893.874] THOSE YEARS.
[ct=5895.188] THAT STOP THE FORWARD FUMBLE.
[ct=5899.315] BEGINNING OF THAT PLAY.
[ct=5900.561] AL: IT DID.
[ct=5907.228] KIRK: THE WHOLE CREW.
[ct=5909.883] AL: WE'VE SEEN A FEW.
[ct=5911.140] BUT NOT THAT ONE.
[ct=5915.176] THIRD AND 8.
[ct=5927.119] KIRK: GOD, THIS KID FOR A
[ct=5927.119] ROOKIE, SUCH GREAT COMMAND.
[ct=5932.596] AL: LOOKING SHARP.
[ct=5933.959] SHORT FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5937.947] AMEER ABDULLAH MAKES THAT.
[ct=5941.921] KIRK: THEY ARE GOING TO PUNTED
[ct=5941.921] AWAY WHICH IS FINE.
[ct=5944.588] AT THIS POINT, IT'S MEANINGLESS.
[ct=5945.934] YOU GO BACK TO THE DEVELOPING OF
[ct=5945.934] THIS YOUNG GUY.
[ct=5948.549] ANTONIO PURCHASED --
[ct=5951.182] TELLING US, HE NEEDS TO LEARN TO
[ct=5951.182] PULL THE TRIGGER.
[ct=5953.877] YOU HAVE TO CHECK IT DOWN.
[ct=5955.156] DON'T TAKE THE SACK.
[ct=5957.825] DON'T WORRY ABOUT ALWAYS HAVING
[ct=5957.825] TO MAKE A PLAY.
[ct=5960.515] THE ONLY WAY YOU LEARN THAT IS
[ct=5961.846] YOU GO THROUGH THAT AS A YOUNG
[ct=5965.821] I THINK THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT
[ct=5967.079] NIGHT FOR NUMBER FOUR.
[ct=5972.463] AL: THE PUNT.
[ct=5975.110] BOUNCING OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=5984.413] >> MCCONNELL HAS HAD A BIG NIGHT
[ct=5985.696] BECAUSE HE'S GONE AFTER NUMBER
[ct=5987.050] 43 MICHAEL DAVIS ON THE OTHER
[ct=5987.050] SIDE.
[ct=5989.774] NOT JUST TRYING TO MAKE HIM MAKE
[ct=5991.047] TACKLES.
[ct=5992.369] THEY'VE GOTTEN BEHIND HIM.
[ct=5995.036] JACOBY MYERS WITH A HECK CATCH.
[ct=5995.036] NICE THROW.
[ct=6000.302] CROSSING AROUND TO THE ROOKIE
[ct=6002.984] TREY TUCKER FOR A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=6002.984] YOU CAN SEE HIM FRUSTRATED AT
[ct=6005.599] TIMES.
[ct=6006.993] YOU SEE THESE NUMBERS.
[ct=6009.610] SIX RECEPTIONS, 105 YARDS, JUST
[ct=6010.945] IN THE FIRST HALF TONIGHT.
[ct=6016.312] AL: ON THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=6021.561] ISAIAH SPILLER SHUTTING IT DOWN.
[ct=6025.579] EACH TEAM COMING IN WITH FIVE
[ct=6026.917] WINS, EIGHT LOSSES.
[ct=6032.290] THE CHARGERS THOUGHT
[ct=6033.562] BOWL CONTENDERS.
[ct=6034.897] THE RAIDERS NOT QUITE THOUGHT
[ct=6036.165] THAT HIGHLY OF.
[ct=6040.204] THEY HAD JACOBS.
[ct=6044.330] BUT NOT TO BE.
[ct=6045.642] SECOND DOWN AND 5.
[ct=6051.041] THE THROW IS CAUGHT.
[ct=6056.367] TRIES TO GET FREE.
[ct=6056.367] YOU SEE WHERE THEY SPOTTED IT.
[ct=6063.084] IT'S TO BE SHORT.
[ct=6065.780] KIRK: YOU SEE THAT BODY
[ct=6065.780] LANGUAGE?
[ct=6069.588] PLAYERS WHO ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY
[ct=6072.299] FRUSTRATED WITH THE SEASON, WITH
[ct=6076.295] A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS.
[ct=6077.574] YOU COULD SEE IT FROM SPILLER,
[ct=6078.917] FROM EVERETT THERE.
[ct=6084.237] AL: ONE FOR 25 ON THIRD AND
[ct=6084.237] FOURTH DOWN THE LAST FEW GAMES.
[ct=6089.949] FINALLY, FINALLY.
[ct=6090.956] MOVE THOSE STICKS QUICKLY.
[ct=6092.315] NO FLAGS.
[ct=6097.535] TWO MINUTES LEFT IN THE THIRD.
[ct=6098.907] THAT'S ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE.
[ct=6104.483] DEAN SPANOS HAS HAD SOME GOOD
[ct=6104.483] TIMES AND SOME VERY FRUSTRATING
[ct=6107.108] TONIGHT OBVIOUSLY IS OF THE
[ct=6108.433] LATTER CATEGORY.
[ct=6116.164] FROM THE 31.
[ct=6122.841] BREAKS THE TACKLE.
[ct=6125.504] TURNS IT INTO A NICE RUN.
[ct=6129.471] THAT SHOULD BE FIRST DOWN BEFORE
[ct=6130.832] HE'S TACKLED BY KHALIL NICHOLS.
[ct=6133.489] KIRK: PATRICK GRAHAM TOLD ME
[ct=6133.489] ABOUT THE MATCH UP.
[ct=6136.076] HE HAD GOTTEN THE NEWS THAT
[ct=6136.076] KEENAN A
[ct=6140.096] HE SAID, WHEN I THOUGHT KEENAN
[ct=6140.096] ALLEN WAS IN THE GAME,
[ct=6142.730] EVERYTHING WILL RUN THROUGH HIM.
[ct=6145.408] THEN THEY FIND OUT KEENAN ALLEN
[ct=6148.092] IS OUT AND HE SAID, ECKLER
[ct=6149.389] HASN'T HAD A GREAT YEAR BUT NOW
[ct=6150.760] WE HAVE TO LOCK IN ON 30.
[ct=6153.356] NOT SO MUCH IN RUNNING GAME BUT
[ct=6153.356] CATCHING THE
[ct=6154.751] BACKFIELD.
[ct=6156.040] WE HAVEN'T SEEN A TON OF IT
[ct=6157.813] TONIGHT BUT THAT WAS THE FOCUS.
[ct=6161.791] AL: THEY HAVE LOCKED IN ON HIM.
[ct=6164.540] STICK DOWNFIELD.
[ct=6165.933] TWO DEEP AND INCOMPLETE.
[ct=6168.541] THERE WAS QUENTIN JOHNSTON.
[ct=6171.184] HE WAS THE NUMBER ONE PICK, THE
[ct=6171.184] ROOKIE OUT OF TCU.
[ct=6173.855] HE HASN'T HAD A GOOD YEAR TO
[ct=6175.154] THIS POINT.
[ct=6176.499] KIRK: IF YOU LOOK AT HIS
[ct=6179.141] RECEIVERS, THERE'S JUST NOT A
[ct=6179.141] LOT OF PRODUCTION TONIGHT.
[ct=6181.993] I KNOW YOU HAVE A YOUNG
[ct=6183.145] YOU GET DOWN EARLY
[ct=6184.486] BECOMES OBVIOUS WHAT THE
[ct=6184.486] PLAYCALLING IS.
[ct=6188.437] I KNOW PALMER HAD THE BIG
[ct=6189.845] TOUCHDOWN PLAY.
[ct=6193.812] WITHOUT KEENAN ALLEN, THERE'S NO
[ct=6195.083] ONE REALLY TO TURN TO ON THE
[ct=6197.789] MIKE WILLIAMS WENT DOWN EARLIER
[ct=6197.789] IN THE YEAR.
[ct=6201.762] AL: VERY EARLY IN THE SEASON.
[ct=6204.372] EVERY TEAM HAS HAD THEIR SHARE
[ct=6205.776] OF INJURIES.
[ct=6208.415] KELLY IS BANGED INTO THE BENCH.
[ct=6211.035] TAKES A COUPLE OF THE CHAIN GANG
[ct=6211.035] GUYS WITH HIM.
[ct=6215.059] JOEY BOSA IS ANOTHER
[ct=6216.357] HAVEN'T SEEN ON THE DEFENSIVE
[ct=6221.648] WILLIAMS, JUSTIN HERBERT.
[ct=6225.621] NO SYMPATHY FROM ANY OTHER TEAM
[ct=6225.621] THOUGH.
[ct=6226.952] EVERYBODY IS BANGED UP.
[ct=6230.948] TOTALLY AT THIS POINT.
[ct=6233.605] FINAL MINUTE.
[ct=6238.982] THAT WILL BE A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=6242.894] AFTER THEY WERE ONE FOR 25, THEY
[ct=6247.014] KICK -- PICK UP BACK-TO-BACK TO
[ct=6247.014] BACK THIRD DOWN CONVERSIONS.
[ct=6251.161] KIRK: THAT TIME, YOU SAW STICK
[ct=6252.287] GET BACK.
[ct=6253.913] HE HAD A GOOD IDEA BASED ON THE
[ct=6253.913] COVERAGE HE
[ct=6254.998] QUICKLY.
[ct=6257.569] AL: LITTLE HUDDLE HERE.
[ct=6258.964] STICK LOOKING.
[ct=6260.298] LOOK OUT FROM BEHIND.
[ct=6265.541] IT'S GOING TO BE RULED --
[ct=6266.911] ALIVE AND GOING TO THE END ZONE
[ct=6272.217] IT'S RULED A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=6273.595] JOHN JENKINS.
[ct=6277.542] HE WAS CAUGHT BY MALCOLM KOONCE
[ct=6278.889] WHO HAS HAD A GIGANTIC NIGHT.
[ct=6282.859] THAT WILL END THE QUARTER.
[ct=6285.486] OBVIOUSLY ALL SCORING PLAYS
[ct=6285.486] REVIEWED.
[ct=6288.212] KIRK: THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT
[ct=6290.820] KOONZ CONTINUES TO GIVE THE LEFT
[ct=6293.472] TACKLE RASHAWN SLATER A TOUGH
[ct=6297.414] AGAIN, I THINK ALL THE ATTENTION
[ct=6298.705] IS ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH MAXX
[ct=6299.989] CROSBY.
[ct=6303.970] INSTEAD, IT'S THE EFFORT OF NOT
[ct=6305.340] GIVING UP ON THAT PLAY.
[ct=6307.990] HE COMES UP WITH THAT BIG SECOND
[ct=6309.273] GET STICK TRIES TO AVOID CROSBY
[ct=6311.918] AND DOESN'T EVEN SEE HIM WHO
[ct=6313.227] COMES ALL THE WAY AROUND TO
[ct=6314.635] KNOCK THE BALL LOOSE.
[ct=6317.281] HOW ABOUT THE BIG FELLA JENKINS?
[ct=6318.603] COMING UP WITH THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=6321.237] AL: IN THE BACK DOOR.
[ct=6326.566] JENKINS, 34-YEAR-OLD DEFENSIVE
[ct=6329.205] TACKLE, 11TH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=6342.477] AL: JENKINS IS LISTED AT 6'3",
[ct=6342.477] 327 POUNDS.
[ct=6345.145] AWAY HE GOES.
[ct=6347.798] KIRK: ANTONIO PIERCE HAVING FUN
[ct=6349.390] WITH THE BIG FELLA.
[ct=6350.714] HE'S ALSO 34 YEARS OLD.
[ct=6352.024] NOT ONLY IS HE A BIG DEFENSIVE
[ct=6354.684] TACKLE -- I WONDER HOW MANY
[ct=6356.014] TIMES IN HIS WHOLE CAREER HE'S
[ct=6357.447] PICKED UP A FUMBLE AND HAD A
[ct=6358.585] CHANCE TO RUN IT TH
[ct=6361.334] HE IS STILL TICKLED DOWN THERE.
[ct=6363.942] AL: FIRST SEASON AS A RATER.
[ct=6365.276] THE LAST TWO YEARS WITH THE
[ct=6365.276] DOLPHINS.
[ct=6369.376] CHECK HIM OUT AGAIN HERE.
[ct=6372.094] KIRK: THIS IS GRE
[ct=6373.140] WILL SHOW THE SPEED OF WHAT HE'S
[ct=6377.117] CROSBY FORCES STICK TO STEP UP.
[ct=6379.981] ENDS UP DISLODGING THE BALL.
[ct=6381.253] HERE'S THE BIG MAN RIGHT HERE.
[ct=6383.936] HE GETS HIS HANDS ON IT.
[ct=6385.262] HE SEES A GOAL LINE I
[ct=6389.214] UP TO 17 MILES PER OUR.
[ct=6390.593] JUST TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE.
[ct=6394.544] I KNOW, -- TYREE GALE GOES 22 OR
[ct=6394.544] 23.
[ct=6397.414] HE'S GOING THROUGH THE WHOLE
[ct=6397.414] STORY OF WHAT HE DID.
[ct=6399.845] PUT YOUR TREADMILL AT 70 MILES
[ct=6402.538] PER HOUR AND YOU CAN APPRECIATE
[ct=6402.538] WHAT BIG JOHN JENKINS DUSTED.
[ct=6406.464] AL: FASTER THAN BENNY HILL.
[ct=6411.814] BUTLER MAKES THAT TACKLE.
[ct=6415.803] KAYLEE: I THINK EVERYBODY IN A
[ct=6419.826] RATER'S UNIFORM HAS MADE THEIR
[ct=6421.129] WAY OVER TO JENKINS TO LOVE
[ct=6422.397] HIM AND HELP THEM CELEBRATE THAT
[ct=6422.397] MOMENT.
[ct=6425.074] A COUPLE OF THE GUYS WERE
[ct=6426.422] YELLING, WE HAVE TO CHECK THE
[ct=6426.422] GPS.
[ct=6429.059] YOU HAD TO BE GOI
[ct=6430.393] THEY WILL BE DISAPPOINTED WHEN I
[ct=6431.941] TELL THEM HE DIDN’
[ct=6433.086] TELL THEM HE DIDN'T HIT 20 MILES
[ct=6433.086] PER HOUR.
[ct=6434.346] THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE.
[ct=6437.120] KIRK: 17 ISN'T TERRIBLE.
[ct=6438.581] AL: AND DIDN'T NEED A PITSTOP.
[ct=6443.801] WILL CLAPP THE CENTER IS NOW
[ct=6445.195] DOWN IN AN INJURY TIMEOUT.
[ct=6447.822] >> THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL ON
[ct=6449.182] IT'S ON.
[ct=6451.802] >> THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL IS
[ct=6451.802] ON.
[ct=6454.413] NEXT WEEK, T
[ct=6455.789] THE RAMS.
[ct=6457.121] STREAM THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL
[ct=6458.440] ONLY ON PRIME.
[ct=6463.771] TONIGHT ON TNF NIGHT CAP, OUR
[ct=6467.736] TEAM CAPS OFF THE GAME WITH FUN,
[ct=6467.736] FANS, AND FOOTBALL'S BEST.
[ct=6471.724] TNF NIGHT CAP,
[ct=6473.091] ALLSTATE AFTER THE GAME.
[ct=6477.043] AL: WELL, THIS AGONIZING NIGHT
[ct=6479.670] FOR THE CHARGERS CONTINUES AS
[ct=6482.284] WILL CLAPP NEEDS TO BE ASSISTED
[ct=6484.905] OFF THE FIELD ON THE CART.
[ct=6486.209] CORY LESLIE WAS THERE STARTING
[ct=6487.583] CENTER EARLY IN THE SEASON.
[ct=6490.204] HE WENT ON IR.
[ct=6494.290] CLAPP HAS COME INTO START 10.
[ct=6496.838] NOW YOU HAVE BRENDEN JAIMES,
[ct=6498.183] NUMBER 64.
[ct=6499.535] HE COMES IN TO TAKE THAT SPOT.
[ct=6502.173] KIRK: THAT WAS A BIG LOSS FOR
[ct=6504.850] LESLIE, ONE OF THE TOP CENTERS
[ct=6506.160] OUT AFTER THREE GAMES.
[ct=6511.410] AL: SECOND DOWN
[ct=6512.695] OH BABY.
[ct=6514.047] UNBELIEVABLE.
[ct=6515.386] JACK JONES.
[ct=6516.694] HE'LL DO IT AGAIN.
[ct=6524.842] I MEAN, THERE ARE BAD DREAMS AND
[ct=6526.120] THEN THERE ARE CRAZY BAD DREAMS.
[ct=6527.456] FOR THE CHARGERS, IT'S BEEN THAT
[ct=6528.774] KIND OF A NIGHT.
[ct=6531.676] KIRK: I'LL TELL YOU, JACK JONES
[ct=6533.054] WHO PLAYS A LOT MORE MAN, HE
[ct=6535.675] JUST READ THIS.
[ct=6538.288] WHEN ECKLER WENT IN MOTION, HE
[ct=6542.310] MUST HAVE SEEN THIS AND HE KNEW
[ct=6543.662] EXACTLY WHAT WAS COMING.
[ct=6544.977] THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
[ct=6546.278] IT'S LIKE HE WAS IN THE HUDDLE.
[ct=6547.640] HE REACTS QUICKER THAN ANYBODY
[ct=6550.277] FROM THE OFFENSE.
[ct=6551.643] IT'S LIKE HE KNEW THAT THIS WAS
[ct=6552.954] THE PLAY THEY RUN TO GET HIM TO
[ct=6555.592] 30 AND HE SAID, NOT ON MY WATCH.
[ct=6556.966] HE STEPPED RIGHT IN FRONT OF IT
[ct=6559.528] ONE-HANDED AND WALKS INTO THE
[ct=6567.441] AL: MOST POINTS THE RAIDERS HAVE
[ct=6567.441] EVER SCORED.
[ct=6570.087] 63.
[ct=6572.642] YOU HAVE 14:30 LEFT IN THE GAME.
[ct=6575.326] MOST POINTS THE CHARGERS HAVE
[ct=6576.617] EVER GIVEN UP.
[ct=6580.590] KIRK: JACK JONES, HE'S A GUY
[ct=6583.231] THAT HAS HAD TO BATTLE THROUGH.
[ct=6584.651] HE WAS LET GO BY THE PATS.
[ct=6587.267] PICKED UP BY ANTONIO PIE
[ct=6588.600] COACHED HIM AT HIGH SCHOOL AND
[ct=6592.556] AT ARIZONA STATE.
[ct=6592.556] BELIEVES IN
[ct=6593.917] ANOTHER CHANCE AND ANOTHER
[ct=6597.884] NOTHING HE COULD DO THERE.
[ct=6599.180] AS SOON AS HE READ THAT, SAW THE
[ct=6603.163] FORMATION, GOOD INDICATOR FOR
[ct=6604.550] HIM TO JUMP.
[ct=6608.560] AL: HERBERT IS
[ct=6609.918] HE PUT STAKE IN.
[ct=6611.215] HE WAS THE BACKUP?
[ct=6613.901] MAX DUGGAN.
[ct=6615.192] RICKY OUT OF TCU WHO IS SECOND
[ct=6617.883] TO CALEB WILLIAMS AND THE
[ct=6619.177] HEISMAN BALLOTING LAST YEAR.
[ct=6621.860] HE HASN'T PLAYED A LOT.
[ct=6628.393] KIRK: JUST NOT A LOT OF OPTIONS
[ct=6628.393] FOR THIS CHARGERS TEAM.
[ct=6635.037] OTHER THAN JUST GETTING REPS, IT
[ct=6635.037] OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T MATTER.
[ct=6643.151] AL: 63 POINTS, THE MOST EVER IN
[ct=6644.513] RAIDERS HISTORY.
[ct=6649.823] KIRK: ALL THEY NEED IS 10 MORE
[ct=6651.112] FOR THE NFL RECORD.
[ct=6653.813] ONLY 10.
[ct=6656.464] AL: NO PROBLEM.
[ct=6665.772] A TEAM THAT WAS SHUT OUT LAST
[ct=6665.772] WEEK.
[ct=6677.715] TONIGHT, A VERY DIFFERENT STORY.
[ct=6679.012] AL: THE CHARGERS WITH FIVE
[ct=6681.624] TURNOVERS AND BURNED AFTER EVERY
[ct=6683.005] ONE OF THEM.
[ct=6694.859] REMEMBER MILLS
[ct=6696.292] REFEREE?
[ct=6697.615] KIRK: SURE D.
[ct=6700.241] AL: HE WOULD WAIVE IT OFF RIGHT
[ct=6706.951] SECOND AND 9.
[ct=6709.548] KIRK: DIABLO IS DOWN.
[ct=6713.528] AL: DIVINE DEABLO.
[ct=6716.244] KIRK: THAT’
[ct=6718.875] KIRK: THAT'S TAKING ADVANTAGE.
[ct=6718.875] THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD PERCENTAGE.
[ct=6722.857] FIVE TAKEAWAYS, FIVE TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=6726.839] SO YOU GO FROM ONE GAME WHERE
[ct=6730.803] YOU JUST WANT UP HIGH FROM
[ct=6732.164] EVERYBODY TO THE COMPLETE
[ct=6733.450] OPPOSITE END OF THE SPECTRUM IF
[ct=6734.784] YOU ARE THE RAIDERS.
[ct=6736.061] NOW IT'S THE CHARGERS.
[ct=6738.793] AL: AS WE SAID GOING TO
[ct=6741.870] COMMERCIAL, IT'S THE NFL WHERE
[ct=6741.870] ANYTHING HAPPENS.
[ct=6747.376] KIRK: THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE ALL
[ct=6748.632] THESE BIG BUILDERS OUT HERE.
[ct=6750.005] IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT
[ct=6751.243] WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
[ct=6752.606] AL: AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH.
[ct=6758.010] >> FIRST TIME OUT OF THE HALF.
[ct=6759.241] KIRK: NEXT WEEK, HOME GAME.
[ct=6761.914] AL: HOW ABOUT THAT?
[ct=6764.789] THE SAINTS AND THE RAMS.
[ct=6771.307] THEY ARE IN THE PLAYOFF HUNT
[ct=6774.023] THEY BEAT WASHINGTON THIS WEEK.
[ct=6777.960] WE WILL TAKE IT OFF NEXT WEEK
[ct=6779.293] WITH PREGAME AT 7:00 EASTERN
[ct=6780.678] FROM SOPHIA.
[ct=6783.278] -- SOFI.
[ct=6787.264] ALLEGIANT STADIUM.
[ct=6789.928] VEGAS HAS BECOME A SPORTS MECCA.
[ct=6795.217] REMEMBER, THIS IS THE HOME OF
[ct=6796.587] THE STANLEY CUP CHAMPIONS.
[ct=6799.193] KIRK: AND THEY'VE BEEN GOOD
[ct=6800.540] PRETTY MUCH FROM THE JUMP.
[ct=6803.159] AL: FROM THE GET-GO.
[ct=6805.895] BENEFICIARIES OF A VERY
[ct=6808.544] LUCRATIVE DRAFT.
[ct=6811.172] SPEAKING OF THAT, YOU HAVE A
[ct=6815.144] GOLDEN NIGHTS.
[ct=6817.862] THIS TOWN LOVES THEIR CHAMPIONS.
[ct=6820.474] YOU HAVE THE RAIDERS REBUILDING
[ct=6821.815] THEIR STADIUM.
[ct=6825.821] THE ACES OWNED BY
[ct=6828.450] CHAMPIONSHIPS.
[ct=6832.335] THE SUPER BOWL WILL BE PLAYED
[ct=6833.627] HERE IN FEBRUARY.
[ct=6834.985] THE STADIUM OPENED IN 2028.
[ct=6838.913] I GUARANTEE ON THE NBA OUTLOOK.
[ct=6843.222] THEY AND SEATTLE WOULD BE THE
[ct=6844.306] NEXT EXPANSION FRANCHISES.
[ct=6845.579] STICK THROWS, IT IS CAUGHT.
[ct=6850.922] KIRK:3
[ct=6856.263] KIRK: ISN'T IT AMAZING HOW FAR
[ct=6856.263] SPORTS HAS COME IN THIS CITY?
[ct=6860.194] YOU DID NOT WANT TO THINK ABOUT
[ct=6862.985] IT, SPORTS GAMBLING AND
[ct=6862.985] PROFESSIONAL SPORTS, EVERYTHIN
[ct=6864.141] ASSOCIATED WITH IT, YOU WOULD
[ct=6865.589] NEVER HAVE ENVISIONED FRANCHISES
[ct=6870.989] NOW, EVERYBODY IS COMING IN.
[ct=6885.611] MOVING AHEAD IS JOSHUA KELLEY.
[ct=6889.570] THE CHARGERS WILL GO HOME.
[ct=6890.940] THEIR NEXT GAME IS SATURDAY
[ct=6892.235] AGAINST BUFFALO.
[ct=6893.546] THEN THEY GO TO DENVER.
[ct=6896.227] THEN AT HOME AGAINST KANSAS
[ct=6897.505] CITY.
[ct=6900.201] NOT EASY.
[ct=6905.432] WHAT A NIGHT FOR THAT GUY.
[ct=6909.609] 241 YARDS, FOUR TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=6913.525] I THINK HE HAS SECURED THE
[ct=6913.525] STARTING SPOT.
[ct=6920.405] REVERSING DIRECTIONS.
[ct=6924.399] UP TO THE 41.
[ct=6925.744] THE REMAINING SCHEDULES.
[ct=6933.747] THE RAIDERS GO TO KANSAS CITY,
[ct=6936.395] GO TO INDIANAPOLIS, AND
[ct=6937.655] WITH DENVER HERE.
[ct=6941.651] KIRK: THIS IS A GREAT NIGHT, BUT
[ct=6944.346] THEY WILL HAVE TO SWEEP THE
[ct=6945.671] THREE REMAINING GAMES THEY HAVE
[ct=6949.623] AND NEED SOME HELP SITTING AT
[ct=6952.271] 9-8.
[ct=6962.931] AL: STICK.
[ct=6965.557] HE GETS OUT, RUNS.
[ct=6969.536] SLIDES TO A STOP AT THE 48 FOR A
[ct=6972.246] KIRK: I TOLD YOU HIS L
[ct=6973.558] BE A FACTOR.
[ct=6974.861] AL: EVENTUALLY.
[ct=6977.493] IT ONLY TOOK 48 MINUTES.
[ct=6981.523] KIRK: THAT IS WHAT I THOUGHT WE
[ct=6982.828] WOULD SEE TONIGHT, HIS ABILITY
[ct=6984.267] TO IMPROVISE AND SCRAMBLE, TRY
[ct=6985.481] TO GET FIRST DOWNS.
[ct=6988.187] VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU ARE
[ct=6989.456] USED TO SEEING WITH JUSTIN
[ct=6989.456] HERBERT.
[ct=6993.438] THIS GAME GOT AWAY FROM HIM AND
[ct=6994.762] THIS TEAM IN A HURRY.
[ct=7000.081] DOWN 21-0 IN THE FIRST QUARTER.
[ct=7008.038] AL: STICK SHOOT SET OUT.
[ct=7010.744] -- SHOOTS IT OUT.
[ct=7017.347] THIS CROWD SMELLS BLOOD.
[ct=7021.310] KIRK: THEY ARE NOT LETTING UP,
[ct=7022.688] JUST LIKE THE RAIDERS.
[ct=7025.385] AL: IT IS LIKE THE ROMAN
[ct=7026.673] COLISEUM RIGHT NOW.
[ct=7034.681] SECOND AND 10.
[ct=7054.581] HE GETS TO THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=7061.223] THE BACKUP QUARTERBACKS HAVING A
[ct=7062.503] SUPER NIGHT, YOU GO BACK TO
[ct=7065.567] TENNESSEE.
[ct=7071.435] KIRK: IT LOOKED LIKE CINCINNATI
[ct=7072.663] WAS DOWN AFTER JOE BURROW WAS
[ct=7073.973] DONE, THEN THE BIG GAME IN
[ct=7075.265] JACKSONVILLE AND FOLLOWS IT UP
[ct=7077.956] WITH ANOTHER WIN LAST WEEK.
[ct=7080.608] I THINK THERE IS A PREMIUM ON
[ct=7083.233] DEPTH ON OFFENSIVE LINE PLAY,
[ct=7085.911] AND THAT BACKUP QUARTERBACK.
[ct=7087.221] AL: NO GAIN.
[ct=7089.930] SPILLER.
[ct=7093.893] THE INJURY BUG HAS HIT ABOUT
[ct=7093.893] EVERYBODY.
[ct=7097.898] AARON RODGERS, FOURTH PLAY OF
[ct=7097.898] THE SEASON.
[ct=7100.673] COUSINS AND JONES AND WATSON AND
[ct=7103.515] BURROW AND PICKETT AND HERBERT.
[ct=7108.730] KIRK: WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS AN
[ct=7113.601] OFFENSIVE LINE, I THINK IT IS A
[ct=7116.735] COMBINATION OF BACKUP
[ct=7120.663] QUARTERBACK PLAY AND JUST SEEING
[ct=7123.368] OFFENSIVE LINE DECIMATED IT
[ct=7123.368] SEEMS EVERY WEEK.
[ct=7129.999] AL: THE THROW, AND IT IS PALMER.
[ct=7132.607] JOSHUA PALMER PULLS IT IN.
[ct=7136.613] KIRK: ZONE COVERAGE, YOU HAVE TO
[ct=7137.133] GET THAT BALL OVER THE TOP OF
[ct=7137.723] THE LINEBACKERS.
[ct=7141.393] WHAT A GREAT JOB OF SHOWING WHAT
[ct=7142.716] HE IS CAPABLE OF THROWING THIS
[ct=7142.928] FOOTBALL.
[ct=7146.064] THIS IS THE AREA HE HAS IMPROVED
[ct=7148.437] THE MOST IN FIVE YEARS.
[ct=7151.161] HE CAME IN AS A GOOD ATHLETE AND
[ct=7151.161] PLAYMAKER.
[ct=7155.138] HE WOULD BE THE FIRST TO TELL
[ct=7156.491] YOU HOW MUCH HE HAS WORKED ON
[ct=7156.491] THAT ASPECT OF HIS GAME.
[ct=7159.097] ONE OF THE FIRST CHANCES WE HAVE
[ct=7164.451] SEEN HIM THROWING IT DOWN
[ct=7164.451] FIELD IT HAD TO BE
[ct=7165.760] IT WAS.
[ct=7169.723] AL: STICK TO THE END ZONE, AND
[ct=7169.723] THAT IS A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=7171.272] ALEX ERICKSON.
[ct=7177.951] YOU LOOK AT STICK'S NUMBERS,
[ct=7184.037] PRETTY GOOD, 240 YARDS, TWO
[ct=7186.716] TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=7190.706] KIRK: WHENEVER IT COMES OVER,
[ct=7192.016] YOU GET MOTION HERE, WATCH THE
[ct=7194.702] SAFETY COME DOWN.
[ct=7194.702] THAT CHANGES THE COVERAGE.
[ct=7198.676] HE HAS TO SEE THAT AS THE BALL
[ct=7202.680] IS SNAPPED SO IT OPENS UP THE
[ct=7202.680] SKINNY POST FOR A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=7206.661] GOOD JOB OF SEEING THAT AFTER
[ct=7206.661] THE MOTION.
[ct=7209.304] TOUGH TO DO FOR A GUY WITHOUT A
[ct=7209.304] LOT OF EXPERIENCE.
[ct=7213.273] AL: EXTRA POINT IS GOOD.
[ct=7217.307] 8:30 TO GO IN THE FOURTH.
[ct=7218.597] 63-14
[ct=7230.530] KIRK: WE WI
[ct=7231.863] CROSBY WHO ALWAYS GIVES
[ct=7233.206] TREMENDOUS EFFORT NO MATTER WHAT
[ct=7234.517] HE IS FACING.
[ct=7238.491] HERE IS THAT SPIN MOVE WHERE HE
[ct=7241.195] ALMOST GETS STICK TO FORCE THE
[ct=7241.195] BALL OUT.
[ct=7243.857] I LOVE TO WATCH HIM PLAY.
[ct=7246.484] EVEN WHEN HE DOES NOT MAKE THE
[ct=7247.614] PLAY, HE HELPS FORCE THE PLAY.
[ct=7251.402] THERE IS THE BIG FELLA, JENKINS.
[ct=7254.244] HE GOT UP TO 70 MPH.
[ct=7259.366] -- 17 MPH.
[ct=7262.184] AL: THAT IS LIKE FORMULA ONE.
[ct=7268.610] CARTER.
[ct=7272.569] HE TAKES IT BACK TO THE 24.
[ct=7276.652] KIRK: IT HAS BEEN AN UNUSUAL
[ct=7277.938] NIGHT AS FAR AS THESE
[ct=7281.901] BOLDEN TAKES THIS INTO THE
[ct=7285.873] ENDZONE.
[ct=7289.975] THIS WAS FOR A TOUCHDOWN, THIS
[ct=7292.594] WITH A SACK BY KOONTZ.
[ct=7295.251] UNBELIEVABLE JOB ONE-HANDED.
[ct=7296.586] GOOD JOB RECOGNIZING THAT.
[ct=7301.927] MARK DAVIS CANNOT BELIEVE SOME
[ct=7304.564] OF THESE TOUCHDOWNS HE HAS SEEN.
[ct=7307.185] AL: HE IS GOING, WHERE WAS SOME
[ct=7308.542] OF THIS LAST WEEK?
[ct=7313.858] UP TO THE 29 YARD LINE, DAVANTE
[ct=7323.473] IN THE NFL CHAMPIONSHIP GAME,
[ct=7327.222] 1940, THEY WON 73-0.
[ct=7330.426] WASHINGTON, 72 AGAINST THE
[ct=7332.700] GIANTS IN 1966.
[ct=7334.669] THE DOLPHINS THIS YEAR AGAINST
[ct=7335.082] DENVER.
[ct=7342.024] THE RAMS BACK IN 1970, 70
[ct=7344.790] SECOND AND 3.
[ct=7349.073] BUYING TIME, THROWING, BROKEN
[ct=7350.333] UP.
[ct=7358.443] THIRD AND 3.
[ct=7362.449] KIRK: DAVANTE ADAMS ON AN OPTION
[ct=7363.786] ROUTE BUT THE CHARGERS TOOK HIM
[ct=7365.143] AWAY.
[ct=7367.785] TWO DIFFERENT DEFENDERS ON THE
[ct=7369.116] OUTSIDE AND INSIDE.
[ct=7371.760] HE IS NOT THE MOST NIMBLE.
[ct=7377.095] HE IS NOT A STATUE BUT HE IS
[ct=7377.095] ABLE TO GET AWAY FROM PRESSURE.
[ct=7381.152] JUST A NICE PLAY BY JAMES.
[ct=7391.709] AL: THEY STOP HIM SHORT OF THE
[ct=7394.341] THAT IS ABDULLAH, MAKING IT
[ct=7398.309] FOURTH DOWN AND 1.
[ct=7402.281] EVEN THOUGH THE CROWD WANTS THEM
[ct=7403.641] TO GO FOR IT, THEY WILL NOT.
[ct=7406.298] KIRK: THERE IS NO WAY THEY ARE
[ct=7407.624] BOOING.
[ct=7410.259] AL: THEY WANT TO SEE 70.
[ct=7414.158] KIRK: THERE IS STILL A LITTLE
[ct=7415.532] OVER SEVEN MINUTES TO GO.
[ct=7421.052] WITH ALL THESE UNUSUAL
[ct=7423.902] TOUCHDOWNS, YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW
[ct=7424.298] THEY WILL SCORE.
[ct=7429.442] AL: YOU CAN ERASE A 49 POINT
[ct=7430.777] DEFICIT IN SIX MINUTES.
[ct=7435.750] CAUGHT AT THE 18.
[ct=7441.101] HE HAS ONE MAN TO BEAT, AND HE
[ct=7442.731] WILL TAKE IT TO THE END ZONE BUT
[ct=7452.437] RAIDERS ARE SIGNALING I
[ct=7453.793] AGAINST THE CHARGERS.
[ct=7457.728] >> HOLDING ON THE RETURN TEAM.
[ct=7460.395] 10 YARDS FROM THE SPOT OF THE
[ct=7460.395] FOUL.
[ct=7465.687] LOS ANGELES KEEPS THE BALL,
[ct=7472.387] THAT NEGATES WHAT WOULD BE A
[ct=7472.387] TOUCHDOWN RETURN.
[ct=7475.019] 6:53 REMAINING.
[ct=7484.308] KIRK: YOU WERE THERE THE FIRST
[ct=7485.624] OR SECOND NIGHT.
[ct=7489.596] AL: SECOND NIGHT, UNBELIEVABLE,
[ct=7490.938] LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN.
[ct=7493.601] BALL AT THE 45 YARD LINE.
[ct=7498.924] KIRK: IS IT HOW HIGH IT GOES UP?
[ct=7501.546] AL: THE VISUALS.
[ct=7505.533] U2 WAS PLAYING, AND THEY LOOK
[ct=7508.228] TINY COMPARED TO THE REST OF IT.
[ct=7510.862] IT IS HARD TO EXPLAIN.
[ct=7513.519] KIRK: HOW WERE YOUR SEATS?
[ct=7514.862] AL: VERY GOOD.
[ct=7514.862] [LAUGHTER]
[ct=7518.855] THERE ARE NO BAD SEATS BECAUSE
[ct=7521.461] SO MUCH OF THE ACTION IS
[ct=7522.820] ABOVE YOU.
[ct=7526.820] BAND?
[ct=7529.471] AL: I DON'T KNOW, IT IS A GOOD
[ct=7529.471] QUESTION.
[ct=7533.462] IT IS AMAZING.
[ct=7540.042] THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF STUFF
[ct=7542.767] GOING ON, A BIG EYEBALL THAT
[ct=7542.767] LOOKS AT YOU.
[ct=7545.427] IT IS CRAZY, MAN.
[ct=7550.740] BUT IT IS VEGAS, TOO.
[ct=7554.749] JUST A BLOCK AND A HALF OFF THE
[ct=7556.013] STRIP.
[ct=7557.553] GOOD LUCK PARKING.
[ct=7566.641] CAUGHT FOR A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=7571.978] MAKING THAT GRAB IS JOSHUA
[ct=7571.978] PALMER, TACKLED BY TYLER HALL.
[ct=7576.029] KIRK: THE COMBINATION OF MAXX
[ct=7577.323] CROSBY AND A LOT OF STARTERS
[ct=7579.970] UPFRONT BEING OUT, AND SOFTER
[ct=7582.618] COVERAGE HAS GIVEN STICK A
[ct=7585.254] CHANCE TO OPERATE BETTER AND
[ct=7588.018] WITH MORE TIME, SOFTER COVERAGE,
[ct=7590.706] HE IS HITTING A LOT OF SLANTS
[ct=7592.017] AND UNDERNEATH ROUTES.
[ct=7596.071] AL: IN A GAME LIKE THIS
[ct=7597.349] SPEND SOME TIME ON THE BENCH.
[ct=7600.000] KIRK: HE IS PROBABLY BUMMED OUT
[ct=7606.689] AL: HE PLAYED 97% OF THE SNAPS,
[ct=7607.981] AND TONIGHT IT IS IN T
[ct=7609.317] RANGE.
[ct=7611.955] JOSHUA KELLEY TAKING IT INSIDE
[ct=7613.276] THE 40.
[ct=7615.942] KIRK: EVERYBODY IN THE NFL WORKS
[ct=7618.623] HARD BUT YOU TELL ME TALK TO
[ct=7619.383] HIM, I AM ALWAYS TAKEN BACK ON
[ct=7621.748] THE COMMITMENT HE MAKES.
[ct=7624.433] HE TALKED ABOUT HOW IT IS TOUGH
[ct=7625.414] TO GO ON VACATION BECAUSE HE HAS
[ct=7628.258] TO HAVE HIS FOOD PREPPED AND IT
[ct=7628.893] IS HARD TO DO ON VACATION.
[ct=7632.192] HE IS EXCESSIVE.
[ct=7635.979] HE STARTS AROUND JANUARY 30.
[ct=7638.588] HE CRANKS FROM THERE.
[ct=7642.041] AL: FROM THE OUTSIDE AROUND THE
[ct=7642.404] EDGE PICKING UP THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=7644.130] JOSHUA KELLEY.
[ct=7649.457] >> I ASKED AROUND TRYING TO FIND
[ct=7649.457] THE BEST DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IT
[ct=7651.632] IS LIKE TO FACE MAXX CROSBY ON
[ct=7657.665] AUSTIN EKELER SAID, IMAGINE A
[ct=7659.172] FEROCIOUS WEREWOLF TRYING TO
[ct=7662.738] STALK ITS PREY, NONSTOP UNTIL
[ct=7665.382] THE WHISTLE BLOWS. THAT IS WHAT
[ct=7665.999] CROSBY IS, RELENTLESS.
[ct=7670.202] EKELER DID CREDIT HIS FORMER
[ct=7672.006] OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR FOR
[ct=7674.619] POINTING THAT OUT TO HIM, A
[ct=7674.820] WEREWOLF.
[ct=7678.401] AL: FIRST DOWN HERE.
[ct=7688.011] KIRK: GOING BACK TO HIS FIRST
[ct=7691.349] FEW YEARS, HE SAID, -- I STUDY
[ct=7694.878] WHO I AM GOING UP AGAINST BUT I
[ct=7694.878] AM TOO BUSY STUDYING MYSELF.
[ct=7698.521] WHETHER IT IS PRACTICE OR GAMES,
[ct=7701.908] ALMOST TRYING TO LOOK AT WHERE
[ct=7703.155] IS A WEAKNESS OR STRENGTH, WHERE
[ct=7704.841] CAN I GET BETTER, AND HE
[ct=7706.575] REFERENCED ROD MARINELLI AS
[ct=7708.548] HELPING TEACH HIM THAT EARLY IN
[ct=7708.918] HIS CAREER.
[ct=7713.966] AL: HE IS VERY OPEN ABOUT ALL
[ct=7713.966] THE PROBLEMS HE HAS HAD.
[ct=7717.022] HE HAS COMPLETELY COME OUT THE
[ct=7717.365] OTHER SIDE.
[ct=7719.350] A FLAG HERE.
[ct=7735.448] >> NEUTRAL ZONE INFRACTION.
[ct=7739.442] DEFENSE #97 JUMPED INTO THE
[ct=7740.511] NEUTRAL ZONE AND BECAUSE THE
[ct=7741.049] OFFENSIVE PLAYER TO MOVE.
[ct=7745.118] STILL SECOND DOWN.
[ct=7749.854] KIRK: THEY ARE REALLY EXCITED
[ct=7752.487] ABOUT ROBINSON, AND THE ROOKIE,
[ct=7752.487] WILSON.
[ct=7756.966] THEY THINK MAXX CROSBY GETS A
[ct=7759.770] LOT OF ATTENTION FROM THE
[ct=7762.582] YOU HAVE THREE OTHER GUYS THEY
[ct=7767.963] FEEL CAN WIN ONE-ON-ONE.
[ct=7770.701] AL: A LITTLE FLIP HERE.
[ct=7775.988] AND HE IS SLUNG DOWN.
[ct=7784.629] THE ROOKIE OUT OF FLORIDA, SIXTH
[ct=7786.797] ROUND PICK, MADE THAT TACKLE.
[ct=7789.570] UNDER 4:00 TO GO.
[ct=7802.932] SOME ROOM INSIDE THE 10.
[ct=7807.674] SPILLER TO THE SIX YARD LINE.
[ct=7812.331] KIRK: HE WILL SHOW YOU GREAT
[ct=7812.744] PATIENCE.
[ct=7816.448] HE IS MORE OF AN OUTSIDE ZONE
[ct=7817.977] RUNNER, SO HE HAS SHOWN THAT
[ct=7820.785] ABILITY TO PRESS LATE AND FIND
[ct=7823.539] THAT CREE SAND HIT IT.
[ct=7826.677] -- FIND THAT CREASE AND HIT IT.
[ct=7833.785] AL: TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE
[ct=7836.999] TIMEOUT TO SHOW YOU THE PLAYOFF
[ct=7837.514] PICTURE ONE MORE TIME.
[ct=7841.448] RAVENS RIGHT NOW WOULD HAVE THE
[ct=7844.408] ONE SEED AND THE BYE.
[ct=7848.359] JACKSONVILLE WOULD HOST A GAME
[ct=7848.894] IN THE WILD-CARD ROUND.
[ct=7851.946] TEXANS, BRONCOS, BENGALS, BILLS.
[ct=7858.785] NFC, 49ERS ARE ALREADY IN THE
[ct=7858.927] PLAYOFFS.
[ct=7864.072] DALLAS, DETROIT, TAMPA BAY WOULD
[ct=7864.532] HOST A PLAYOFF GAME.
[ct=7867.903] KIRK: DID YOU SEE THE SHOT OF
[ct=7869.395] ANTONIO PIERCE?
[ct=7872.790] HE IS STILL DOWN THERE, WHICH OF
[ct=7875.466] COURSE YOU WILL SEE, BUT YOU DO
[ct=7876.735] NOT ALWAYS SEE HEAD COACHES
[ct=7877.329] SHOWING THAT KIND OF PASSION.
[ct=7881.021] HE IS CHALLENGING THESE BACKUPS
[ct=7882.794] TO JUST GIVE UP AND LET THEM
[ct=7883.176] SCORE.
[ct=7885.570] HE WANTS TO SEE THEM FIGHT AND
[ct=7886.230] COMPETE.
[ct=7891.179] AL: SECOND AND 3.
[ct=7894.345] CANNOT GET OUTSIDE.
[ct=7899.226] SPILLER IS STOPPED.
[ct=7905.520] KIRK: YOU THINK ABOUT ANTONIO
[ct=7906.611] PIERCE, AS A PLAYER WHAT HE WAS
[ct=7906.976] ABLE TO DO.
[ct=7910.113] HE PLAYED WITH FIRE.
[ct=7913.024] THAT IS THE ASPECT HE BRINGS AS
[ct=7915.587] A COACH, THIS TEAM, THIS DEFENSE
[ct=7917.162] FEEDS OFF OF, THE GUY HAS BEEN
[ct=7921.253] THERE AND KNOWS WHAT IT TAKES.
[ct=7922.239] I LIKE HOW HE CHALLENGES THEM.
[ct=7925.976] AL: THIRD AND THREE.
[ct=7933.246] HE GOES THE OTHER WAY,
[ct=7937.092] MAKING THAT GRAB IS QUENTIN
[ct=7937.409] JOHNSTON.
[ct=7941.271] STICK HIT JOHNSON FOR A
[ct=7943.220] TOUCHDOWN LAST WEEK, GOES BACK
[ct=7943.672] TO THE ROOKIE AGAIN.
[ct=7948.158] THE ROOKIE OUT OF TCU, AND THIS
[ct=7949.250] IS THEIR THIRD TOUCHDOWN OF THE
[ct=7953.297] KIRK: STICK WORKING WITH MOTION
[ct=7953.297] WITH PALMER.
[ct=7957.277] HE WANTS TO GO TO 82, GOES ALL
[ct=7958.316] THE WAY BACK TO THE LEFT.
[ct=7963.470] THREE ON THE BACKSIDE FOR THAT
[ct=7969.049] AL: HE HAD A TD AGAINST DETROIT
[ct=7970.370] EARLIER IN THE SEASON BUT THAT
[ct=7974.603] LONG GAME LAST WEEK IN THE LOSS
[ct=7974.603] AT HOME TO DENVER.
[ct=7977.330] THE EXTRA POINT IS GOOD.
[ct=7984.187] 2:30KIRK: AT LEAST THE CHARGERS
[ct=7985.556] OF SHUT IT DOWN IN THE FIRST
[ct=7988.539] THE OFFENSE HAS BEEN ABLE TO PUT
[ct=7988.991] SOME POINTS UP.
[ct=7997.068] 42-0 AT HALFTIME, THEY PUT 21 UP
[ct=7998.369] IN THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=8001.166] THAT IS A GREAT NUMBER, THE LAST
[ct=8002.841] FOUR GAMES.
[ct=8017.935] AL: TOUCHBACK.
[ct=8025.616] NEXT THURSDAY, SOPHIA STADIUM,
[ct=8025.616] THE SAINTS IN TOWN.
[ct=8032.318] THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL.
[ct=8038.185] LAST TIME I DID A GAME IN THIS
[ct=8040.497] STADIUM WAS THE LAST GAME OF THE
[ct=8040.669] 2021 SEASON.
[ct=8043.992] THE RAIDERS AND THE CHARGERS
[ct=8044.714] WERE MEETING.
[ct=8047.403] THE WINNER WAS GOING TO GO TO
[ct=8048.748] THE PLAYOFFS UNLESS THEY WOUND
[ct=8053.864] UP IN A TIE, AND BOTH TEAMS --
[ct=8054.422] WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF THAT?
[ct=8057.547] KIRK: AT THE BEGINNING OF THE
[ct=8059.288] GAME YOU WERE THINKING THE
[ct=8060.915] STEELERS NEED A TIE, THAT WILL
[ct=8060.915] NEVER HAPPEN.
[ct=8064.369] AL: CHRIS COLLINSWORTH AND I
[ct=8066.052] WERE DRIVING OUT HERE, AND HE
[ct=8067.013] SAID, WHAT IF THERE IS A TIE?
[ct=8069.012] I SAID, GET OUT OF HERE.
[ct=8072.957] THE COACH WAS READY TO PLAY FOR
[ct=8075.952] THE TIME COME ON GET THEM BOTH
[ct=8076.107] INTO THE PLAYOFFS.
[ct=8080.349] THEN CARLSON KICKED THE FIELD
[ct=8082.306] GOAL THAT SENT PITTSBURGH TO THE
[ct=8083.722] PLAYOFFS AND THE CHARGERS HOME.
[ct=8087.757] KIRK: YOU HAVE CALLED SO MANY
[ct=8091.123] BIG GAMES, SUPER BOWLS -- THAT
[ct=8093.727] IS A MEMORABLE GAME BECAUSE IT
[ct=8094.506] IS SUCH AN UNLIKELY OUTCOME.
[ct=8100.564] AL: HERBERT WAS PHENOMENAL,TEELE
[ct=8107.487] ANOTHER UNBELIEVABLY AGONIZING
[ct=8110.323] DEFEAT, ALMOST SELF-INFLICTED
[ct=8111.832] THAT NIGHT FOR THE CHARGERS.
[ct=8120.123] 2:00 UNTIL THE RAIDERS CAN
[ct=8121.602] CELEBRATE.
[ct=8124.622] THE CHARGERS, THE ONLY GOOD NEWS
[ct=8126.150] IS THE FLIGHT HOME IS ABOUT 45
[ct=8127.046] MINUTES.
[ct=8144.977] THIS STARTS WEEK 15.
[ct=8146.778] SOME OF THE OTHER GAMES ON THE
[ct=8148.534] SCHEDULE, MINNESOTA GOES TO
[ct=8153.868] THEN IN EARLY GAME, DALLAS AND
[ct=8155.134] BUFFALO SUNDAY.
[ct=8161.484] BALTIMORE AGAINST JACKSONVILLE
[ct=8161.484] ON SUNDAY NIGHT.
[ct=8166.810] THE MONDAY NIGHTER IS
[ct=8168.101] PHILADELPHIA GOING TO SEATTLE.
[ct=8182.770] THAT WILL MAKE IT FOURTH DOWN
[ct=8186.732] WHITE GETS STOPPED.
[ct=8198.934] EIGHT DIFFERENT PLAYERS SCORING
[ct=8204.035] A TD IN THIS GAME, FIRST TIME
[ct=8206.725] SINCE 1950 WHEN THE RAMS DID IT.
[ct=8209.365] THEY SEND IN THE PUNT GROUP.
[ct=8216.157] WHAT A NIGHT FOR THAT MAN.
[ct=8221.348] 20-34, 248 YARDS AND FOUR
[ct=8229.302] THAT ONE WILL SKIP OUT OF BOUNDS
[ct=8229.302] AROUND THE 20 YARD LINE.
[ct=8231.958] :31 LEFT.
[ct=8237.268] KIRK: IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE AIDAN
[ct=8238.569] O'CONNELL IS IN HIS DEVELOPMENT
[ct=8242.546] AND IN HIS CAREER, GOING THROUGH
[ct=8243.890] WHAT HE WENT THROUGH LAST WEEK
[ct=8246.529] AND SOME OF THE MURMURS AROUND
[ct=8248.215] TOWN WONDERING.
[ct=8251.867] THE MEDIA SAID, IS THIS TOO MUCH
[ct=8251.867] FOR YOU?
[ct=8255.853] HE HAD TO SIT THERE AND TAKE IT,
[ct=8257.183] AND IT IS PART OF GROWING UP.
[ct=8259.838] I THINK HIS RESPONSE TO THE
[ct=8261.167] DIVERSITY SAYS A LOT ABOUT HIM
[ct=8265.162] AND WHAT THIS OFFENSE IS CAPABLE
[ct=8266.445] OF DOING WITH HIM AT THE HELM.
[ct=8275.782] AL: A FEW MORE HERE FOR THE GUY
[ct=8275.782] DOWNSTAIRS CALLING THE GAME
[ct=8277.243] UPSTAIRS NOW.
[ct=8279.850] HE IS PROBABLY ON HIS WAY TO THE
[ct=8279.850] LOCKER ROOM TO CELEBRATE.
[ct=8282.473] THAT WILL WRAP IT UP.
[ct=8290.533] UNBELIEVABLY, A TEAM THAT GETS
[ct=8295.838] SHUT OUT FOUR DAYS AGO AND LAYS
[ct=8298.483] 63 ON THE CHARGERS.
[ct=8303.821] 63-21.
[ct=8309.165] THE RAIDERS GO TO 6-8.
[ct=8313.171] THE CHARGERS GO TO 5-9.
[ct=8315.768] THE RAIDERS GET READY FOR THEIR
[ct=8317.102] FINAL THREE GAMES OF THE SEASON
[ct=8320.812] WITH STILL A CHANCE -- A CHANCE
