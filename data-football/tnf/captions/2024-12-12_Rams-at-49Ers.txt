[ct=3.394] INDEED.
[ct=3.619] THERE ARE THE STANDINGS RIGHT
[ct=4.157] NOW.
[ct=4.803] BUNCHED UP.
[ct=6.368] YOU SEE SEAN McVAY AND KYLE
[ct=7.425] SHANAHAN.
[ct=8.920] SEAHAWKS WITH A ONE GAME LEAD
[ct=9.741] OVER THE RAMS.
[ct=10.736] CARDINALS HAVE LOST THREE
[ct=11.210] STRAIGHT.
[ct=15.890] THE NINERS COME IN 6-7.
[ct=19.612] SO, KAYLEE IN RAIN GEAR
[ct=20.617] TONIGHT BECAUSE IT’S OFF AND ON.
[ct=22.678] THE SHOWERS ARE COMING AND GOING
[ct=23.936] AND FIGURES TO BE THAT WAY FOR A
[ct=24.702] FEW HOURS.
[ct=29.210] RAMS WON THE TOSS AND THEY GE
[ct=29.440] DEFER.
[ct=31.287] THE 49ers WILL START FROM THE 30
[ct=31.541] YARD LINE.
[ct=33.950] BROCK PURDY IS COMING OUT.
[ct=37.843] HE MISSED A GAME A COUPLE OF
[ct=39.174] WEEKS WITH A SORE SHOULDER IN
[ct=39.918] GREEN BAY.
[ct=44.170] THEY WERE ON THE ROAD GREEN BAY
[ct=45.471] AND BUFFALO AND GOT SLAUGHTERED
[ct=46.975] IN THOSE TWO GAMES AND WON
[ct=49.823] AGAINST CHICAGO LAST WEEK.
[ct=52.352] THE MAN WAS DRAFTED AS WE SAID
[ct=53.104] LAST IN 2022.
[ct=54.109] HE TOOK OVER THE STARTING JOB
[ct=55.605] LATE IN THAT SEASON.
[ct=57.332] HE GOT THEM TO THE SUPER BOWL
[ct=58.058] LAST YEAR.
[ct=59.396] AND THIS YEAR IS TRYING TO GET
[ct=62.278] THEM BACK INTO THE PLAYOFFS, AT
[ct=62.561] WORST.
[ct=65.634] GUERENDO STARTS AT RUNNING BACK.
[ct=67.831] OUT OF THE GUN, ON FIRST DOWN
[ct=70.947] FROM THE 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=72.252] PLAY FAKE.
[ct=73.792] PASS IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=75.932] DEEBO SAMUEL HAS BEEN TALKING
[ct=77.310] ABOUT NOT GETTING THE BALL
[ct=77.527] ENOUGH.
[ct=79.561] SO THEY GO RIGHT TO HIM.
[ct=81.328] >> Kirk: VERY FIRST PLAY THEY
[ct=83.325] TRY TO GET THE BALL TO THEIR GUY
[ct=85.711] DEEBO SAMUEL.
[ct=88.349] TIGHT COVERAGE THERE BY
[ct=94.217] WITHERSPOON WHO IS IN FOR DURANT
[ct=98.011] WHO IS OUT TONIGHT.
[ct=100.971] ALL OF THESE GUYS ARE OUT
[ct=103.677] INCLUDING McCAFFREY AND AIYUK.
[ct=105.361] HE IS COMING OFF PROBABLY HIS
[ct=108.211] BEST GAME OF THE YEAR LAST WEEK.
[ct=110.046] >> Al: GUERENDO AROUND THE LEFT
[ct=111.334] SIDE AND GOING NOWHERE AND TAKEN
[ct=113.602] DOWN ABOUT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE
[ct=115.917] BY CHRISTIAN ROZEBOOM.
[ct=116.678] THIRD DOWN AND NINE ON THE
[ct=117.743] OPENING DRIVE OF THE GAME FOR
[ct=118.338] THE 49ers.
[ct=119.976] >> Kirk: YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT
[ct=121.045] EARLIER THIS YEAR ABOUT THE RAMS
[ct=122.789] DEFENSE LOOKING FOR AN IDENTITY
[ct=124.395] AND MOVING PAST THE AARON DONALD
[ct=127.821] ERA AND DONE A HECK OF A JOB
[ct=129.743] WITH LES SNEAD, THEIR GENERAL
[ct=131.145] MANAGER, BRINGING IN A LOT OF
[ct=132.146] TALENT.
[ct=134.798] BRANDON FISKE OUT OF FLORIDA
[ct=136.504] STATE AND JARED VERSE, BOTH
[ct=139.217] ROOKIES HAVE HAD A BIG IMPACT
[ct=150.910] AND LEADER COBIE TURNER.
[ct=153.789] >> Al: BURR-OF-
[ct=156.084] >> Al: BURRIRURDEN
[ct=157.395] >> Al: BURRIRU PURDY WENT TOO DE
[ct=159.458] THE PENALTY IS AGAINST SAN
[ct=161.355] FRANCISCO.
[ct=161.725] >> Referee: THE PENALTY IS
[ct=162.086] DECLINED.
[ct=164.224] IT IS FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=167.951] >> Al: THIRD TIME WE HAVE HAD
[ct=168.557] CLAY MARTIN ON THURSDAY NIGHT
[ct=172.148] AND WE UNDERSTAND WE GET HIM
[ct=173.448] NEXT WEEK WITH DENVER AGAINST
[ct=174.783] THE CHARGERS.
[ct=175.505] >> Kirk: A FRUSTRATING WAY TO
[ct=176.338] START.
[ct=177.432] THREE-AND-OUT FOR KYLE
[ct=181.417] SHANAHAN’S OFFENSE AND GREAT
[ct=182.750] SHATTER FOR
[ct=183.741] START FOR CHRIS SUE LA, THE
[ct=184.472] DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR FOR THE
[ct=184.639] RAMS.
[ct=186.005] GET THE BALL TO STAFFORD RIGHT
[ct=188.475] AWAY AFTER THREE-AND-OUT.
[ct=191.119] >> Al: PAT O’DONNELL SENDS IT
[ct=193.143] DOWN TOWARD XAVIER SMITH.
[ct=198.833] FAIRLY SHORT KICK.
[ct=199.720] FAIR CATCH CALLED FOR AT THE 29
[ct=204.502] AND THAT IS WHERE MATTHEW
[ct=207.359] STAFFORD WILL SET UP SHOP.
[ct=208.309] MATTHEW STAFFORD HAS REALLY COME
[ct=211.111] ON, LIKE THE TEAM, ITSELF.
[ct=212.781] WHEN HE GOT HOT, THE TEAM GOT
[ct=213.435] HOT.
[ct=214.562] 19 TOUCHDOWNS AND SEVEN PICKS
[ct=216.670] AND FOUR STRAIGHT GAMES WITHOUT
[ct=217.041] AN INTERCEPTION.
[ct=217.444] >> Kirk: YEAH.
[ct=218.571] RIGHT NOW PLAYING AS WELL AS
[ct=218.754] ANYBODY.
[ct=219.698] YOU’RE RIGHT.
[ct=222.559] IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE
[ct=223.133] OFFENSIVE LINE GETTING HEALTHY
[ct=224.601] AND THEY CAN RUN THE FOOTBALL
[ct=225.834] DOWNHILLARY NOW AND BE PHYSICAL
[ct=227.963] AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=230.830] KYREN WILLIAMS, 23, THE KEY ON
[ct=233.930] TO SET THIS OFFENSE UP.
[ct=235.927] >> Al: HE IS THE RUNNING BACK.
[ct=237.731] COOPER KUPP IS IN MOTION AND IN
[ct=239.246] MOTION ABOUT EVERY PLAY.
[ct=240.531] FOUR-YARD GAIN FOR WILLIAMS WHO
[ct=242.831] IS A STUD RUNNING BACK.
[ct=245.692] IT’S DRE GREENLAW WHO HAS NOT
[ct=247.452] PLAYED SINCE HE TORE HIS
[ct=249.168] ACHILLES AND TRYING TO RUN OUT
[ct=252.381] ON THE FIELD IN A BIZARRE
[ct=252.381] INCIDENT AT THE SUPER BOWL.
[ct=253.737] HE RAN OUT ON THE FIELD AND WENT
[ct=254.072] DOWN.
[ct=255.260] HE HAS BEEN OUT SINCE THEN.
[ct=256.512] >> Kirk: YOU CAN SEE ON THE VERY
[ct=258.226] FIRST PLAY, IF YOU’RE A NINERS
[ct=259.810] FAN, THAT IS WHAT THIS DEFENSE
[ct=261.250] HAS MISSED, INCLUDING FRED
[ct=262.560] WARNER IN THE MIDDLE WHO GETS A
[ct=263.485] LOT OF ATTENTION.
[ct=265.948] HE’S GOT HIS SIDE-KICK BACK
[ct=266.852] TONIGHT AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL
[ct=268.042] HELP THIS DEFENSE OUT.
[ct=268.555] >> Al: SECOND AND FOUR.
[ct=269.127] WILLIAMS STARTS TO STUMBLE.
[ct=272.300] HE IS TAKEN DOWN TO THE LINE OF
[ct=272.675] SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=275.869] YOU SAW THE FLAG COMING IN.
[ct=276.461] LEONARD FLOYD, HE PLAYED WITH
[ct=277.192] THE RAMS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
[ct=281.339] HE IS IN TO THE STOP.
[ct=282.675] CLAY MARTIN TO MAKE HIS SECOND
[ct=282.849] CALL.
[ct=283.469] IT’S AGAINST THE RAMS.
[ct=287.046] >> Referee: HOLDING, OFFENSE,
[ct=287.970] NUMBER 77.
[ct=289.465] TEN-YARD PENALTY.
[ct=291.193] REPLAY SECOND DOWN.
[ct=293.838] >> Al: JACKSON, THE LEFT TACKLE.
[ct=297.333] >> Kirk: YOU THINK OF LEONARD
[ct=298.658] FLOYD, LIAR
[ct=299.794] FLOYD, LIKE A LOT OF GUYS YOU
[ct=300.928] THINK OF THEM AS GREAT PASS
[ct=302.819] RUSHERS.
[ct=305.616] NICK SORENSEN SAID HE BLOWS UP
[ct=307.034] AWAY HOW PHYSICAL HE IS AGAINST
[ct=308.585] THE RUN.
[ct=310.770] BIG TIME PREP GUY AND GOING UP
[ct=312.034] HIS FORMER TEAM HE WON A SUPER
[ct=312.598] BOWL WITH, YOU KNOW HE IS READY
[ct=312.784] TO GO.
[ct=319.334] >> Al: SECOND AND 14 AFTER THE
[ct=320.173] PENALTY.
[ct=325.367] RUSH IS ON.
[ct=327.970] HE GETS IT AWAY.
[ct=329.359] IT’S INCOMPLETE.
[ct=329.708] COOPER KUPP IS WELL COVERED ON
[ct=330.112] THE PLAY.
[ct=335.957] EVIDENCE COVERED BY DEOMMODORE
[ct=336.900] LENOIR.
[ct=338.032] THIRD DOWN AND 14 FOR THE RAMS.
[ct=338.533] >> Kirk: PRETTY GOOD JOB OF
[ct=340.155] PICKING UP ANY KIND OF MOVEMENT
[ct=341.478] TO GIVE STAFFORD ENOUGH TIME.
[ct=344.389] AS YOU SAID, AL, THERE IS ALWAYS
[ct=347.368] GOING TO BE FREE SNAP MOMENT TO
[ct=347.943] GET A TIP ON THE COVERAGE.
[ct=348.676] STAFFORD WORKS FROM THE LEFT TO
[ct=351.155] THE NIGHT AND LENOIR IN TIGHT
[ct=352.184] COVERAGE ANTICIPATING THAT BALL
[ct=353.565] COMING TO THE BACK SIDE THERE TO
[ct=354.253] KUPP.
[ct=355.553] GOOD COVERAGE.
[ct=356.585] >> Al: SEAN McVAY IN HIS EIGHTH
[ct=357.416] SEASON AS THE HEAD COACH.
[ct=359.872] ALSO THE PLAY CALLER.
[ct=360.232] HERE IS BOSA.
[ct=366.045] HE IS TRYING TO DRAW A BEAD ON
[ct=366.878] STAFFORD ON THIRD AND 14.
[ct=369.120] BLOCKING IS GOOD.
[ct=373.463] AGAIN, INTENDED FOR KUPP.
[ct=374.840] LENOIR, AGAIN, COVERING ON THE
[ct=375.043] PLAY.
[ct=375.357] SO FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=378.908] >> Kirk: BOY, LENOIR WITH
[ct=381.228] ANOTHER GREAT PLAY AND JUST KIND
[ct=383.544] OF FEELING THESE ENDS BREAKING
[ct=383.954] ROUTES.
[ct=385.129] HE IS SITTING BACK WITH A PASS
[ct=385.699] RUSH THAT THEY HAVE.
[ct=387.894] HE IS ABLE TO JUST KIND OF SIT
[ct=389.281] BACK AND READ THE EYES OF
[ct=389.860] STAFFORD.
[ct=391.140] HE KNOWS HE HAS A RECEIVER
[ct=393.401] OUTSIDE, SO THERE IS A THREAT OF
[ct=394.668] THE POTENTIAL PASS TO THE
[ct=395.148] INSIDE.
[ct=396.329] HE JUST READ THE EYES AND TOOK
[ct=400.905] HIM TO THE BALL AND UNDERCUTS IT
[ct=401.340] AND ALMOST COMES UP WITH A PICK.
[ct=403.822] >> Al: ETHAN EVANS, 6’3",
[ct=405.505] 250-POUND PUNTER, SENDS IT DOWN
[ct=406.089] TO THE 19 YARD LINE.
[ct=412.084] JACOB COWING BRINGS IT BACK TO
[ct=412.315] THE 27.
[ct=414.755] SO THE GAME BEGINS WITH EACH
[ct=415.915] 2009.
[ct=419.831] RAMS MOVED TO ST. LOUIS.
[ct=425.127] >> Kirk: HOW GOOD OF A PLAYER IS
[ct=426.648] JOHN TAYLOR?
[ct=431.588] JERRY RICE, OBVIOUSLY.
[ct=435.561] BUT SHAWN TAYLOR.
[ct=436.178] >> Al: PURDY.
[ct=438.287] WIDE OPEN TO KITTLE TO THE
[ct=438.629] MIDDLE OF THE FIELD TO THE 41
[ct=445.538] QUINTIN LAKE RUNS HIM DOWN.
[ct=446.891] KITTLE IN HIS EIGHTH YEAR AS
[ct=448.382] PRODUCTIVE AS EVER.
[ct=449.304] 33 YARDS.
[ct=450.683] >> Kirk: THIS IS WHAT HURT THE
[ct=451.910] RAMS DEFENSE EARLY IN THE YEAR.
[ct=453.873] IT WAS JUST MISCUES.
[ct=456.235] THIS TIME, THE FREE SAFETY,
[ct=460.415] QUENTIN LAKE, 37 THERE, GETS HIS
[ct=460.927] EYES IN THE WRONG SPOT AND IT
[ct=464.090] FREES UP A BIG OPENING OVER THE
[ct=464.493] MIDDLE.
[ct=465.962] THAT IS STEALING FOR BROCK PURDY
[ct=468.596] GOING TO HIS MAIN GUY FOR A HUGE
[ct=471.453] GAIN THERE FOR GEORGE KITTLE.
[ct=471.795] >> Al: FIRST FIRST DOWN OF THE
[ct=475.375] GAME FROM THE 41.
[ct=477.169] AND RUNNING THAT TIME WAS
[ct=478.407] GUERENDO.
[ct=479.164] SAMUEL DOESN’T GET THE BALL
[ct=484.693] ENOUGH AND THEN HE WINDS UP IN
[ct=491.339] THE MAN TO THE GROUND.
[ct=491.981] >> Kirk: MISTIMED THERE WITH THE
[ct=492.194] MOTION.
[ct=493.586] BOTH OF THESE TEAMS DO SO MUCH
[ct=496.791] PRESNAP MOVEMENT AT TIMES AND
[ct=497.889] THAT NI
[ct=500.568] THAT NTIME, NOT TIMED UP WELL.
[ct=502.593] GUERENDO WAS AS SURPRISED AS
[ct=506.698] >> Al: HE SUFFERED A FOOT SPRAIN
[ct=508.180] IN SUNDAY’S GAME AND DID NOT
[ct=510.058] KNOW IF HE WOULD PLAY OR NOT
[ct=511.944] UNTIL LAST NIGHT WHEN SHANAHAN
[ct=514.650] SAID HE IS READY TO GO.
[ct=517.557] DRE GREENLAW WITH BOSA.
[ct=518.008] SECOND AND NINE.
[ct=521.566] THROUGH THE RIGHT SIDE THIS
[ct=522.218] TIME.
[ct=522.820] A PICKUP OF THREE.
[ct=524.689] HE STARTED HIS COLLEGE CAREER AT
[ct=526.961] WISCONSIN AND WOUND UP AT
[ct=528.457] LOUISVILLE, FIFTH ROUND PICK.
[ct=529.248] >> Kirk: AMAZING WHEN YOU START
[ct=530.534] IN HIGH SCHOOL AS A RECEIVER AND
[ct=531.595] YOU GET A LITTLE BIT OF WEIGHT.
[ct=533.899] YOU GO TO WISCONSIN AND THEY
[ct=537.052] FLIP YOU AT RUNNING BACK.
[ct=538.345] OOE
[ct=538.992] HE THEN GOES TO LOUISVILLE.
[ct=540.328] GOOD DOWNHILL RUN.
[ct=542.917] MIKE SHANAHAN AND KYLE SHANAHAN,
[ct=543.694] THEY FIND BACKS.
[ct=546.397] THINK WHAT THEY HAVE LOST, NOT
[ct=550.527] JUST McCAFFREY BUT MASON AND
[ct=552.559] MITCHELL IF YOU GO ALL THE WAY
[ct=552.762] BACK.
[ct=554.740] KAYLEE SAID ON THE FOURTH BACK
[ct=555.538] OF THE SEASON.
[ct=557.019] >> Al: HERE IS SAMUEL AND SAMUEL
[ct=560.344] IS TAKEN DOWN AFTER A GAIN OF
[ct=563.563] ONE BY KOBIE TURNER.
[ct=564.907] SAMUEL WANTS THE BALL MORE AND
[ct=566.139] PROBABLY TO GET THE BALL A LOT
[ct=567.705] MORE AS RUNNING BACK TONIGHT.
[ct=568.651] >> Kirk: I THINK A GREAT WAY TO
[ct=570.073] GET HIM TOUCHES ESPECIALLY WITH
[ct=570.894] THE INJURIES THEY HAVE IN THE
[ct=571.462] BACKFIELD.
[ct=572.805] HE HAS DONE THAT THROUGHOUT HIS
[ct=573.614] CAREER.
[ct=574.783] NOT JUST A JET MOTION.
[ct=575.668] I THINK HE HAS 129 CAREER
[ct=579.989] CARRIES AS A RUNNING BACK, SO
[ct=582.622] HE’LL DO THAT TONIGHT.
[ct=584.496] >> Al: 53-YARD FIELD GOAL
[ct=586.984] ATTEMPT HERE FOR JAKE MOODY.
[ct=588.568] HE’S KIND OF HAD A SPOTTY
[ct=589.656] SEASON.
[ct=593.429] PAT O’DONNELL TO PUT IT DOWN.
[ct=597.604] AND FROM 53 OUT, THAT KICK IS
[ct=600.043] JUST INSIDE THE LEFT UPRIGHT.
[ct=605.394] 5:00 INTO THE GAME, THE 49ers
[ct=605.536] TAKE THE LEAD.
[ct=605.714] 3-0.
[ct=612.019] IN THEATERS.
[ct=616.004] SEAN’S GRANDFATHER, JOHN McVAY.
[ct=617.354] A COACH IN THE ’70s.
[ct=619.706] WHAT A JOB HE DID TO HELP BUILD
[ct=621.981] THE GREAT 49er TEAMS OF THE ’80s
[ct=623.012] AND THE ’90s.
[ct=626.883] KICKOFF HERE.
[ct=629.543] FOR THE RAMS, WE TALK ABOUT WHAT
[ct=631.245] IT’S BEEN LIKE OF LATE AFTER
[ct=633.406] THAT TERRIBLE START ENTERING
[ct=634.938] WEEK EIGHT OF "THURSDAY NIGHT
[ct=635.766] FOOTBALL" AGAINST MINNESOTA.
[ct=638.139] THEY WERE 2-4 AND THEY HAD
[ct=639.765] BEATEN VEGAS THE WEEK BEFORE AND
[ct=643.140] ALL KINDS OF TRADE RUMORS ABOUT
[ct=644.729] COOPER KUPP AND PUKA NACUA
[ct=645.744] MISSED FIVE GAMES AND WHAT IS
[ct=647.031] GOING ON OVER THERE?
[ct=648.746] 5-2 SINCE THAT THURSDAY NIGHT
[ct=649.792] GAME.
[ct=651.935] STAFFORD 16 TDs AND THREE PICKS
[ct=653.348] AND 108 RATING SINCE THEN, SO
[ct=653.728] IT’S ALL COME TOGETHER.
[ct=658.881] WE START THIS DRIVE AFTER A
[ct=660.934] THREE-AND-OUT ON THEIR FIRST
[ct=662.253] DRIVE FROM THE 34.
[ct=666.241] THERE IS AT THE 41 YARD LINE,
[ct=668.409] PUKA NACUA, WHO HE IS FABULOUS
[ct=669.934] TO WATCH.
[ct=670.895] >> Kirk: ADD ANOTHER ONE TO HIS
[ct=671.696] BOOK OF CATCHES.
[ct=673.506] IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY WEEK.
[ct=675.390] HERE HE IS WITH HIS FIRST
[ct=676.363] CHANCE.
[ct=678.978] HE CATCHES THIS ON TOP OF HIS
[ct=680.747] HELMET.
[ct=683.295] WARREN IS IN THERE IN COVERAGE.
[ct=685.337] LET ME USE MY HELMET AS I’M
[ct=686.162] SLAMMED TO THE GROUND ON MY
[ct=687.823] WATCH HIM SECURE THIS.
[ct=688.621] LOOK AT THE STRENGTH THIS GUY
[ct=689.070] HAS.
[ct=690.985] THE RIGHT HAND.
[ct=692.494] GETS THAT LEFT HAND AND HOLDS ON
[ct=694.621] FOR DEAR LIFE AND MAKES THAT
[ct=697.648] CATCH.
[ct=698.803] >> Al: RODNEY HARRISON IS HAVING
[ct=699.927] NIGHTMARES.
[ct=700.101] SECOND AND THREE.
[ct=701.535] NO ROOM IN THE MIDDLE.
[ct=704.497] THAT IS BLAKE CORUM, NUMBER TWO
[ct=706.316] BACK, ROOKIE OUT OF MICHIGAN
[ct=709.675] PICKED IN THE THIRD DOWN.
[ct=712.545] THIRD DOWN AND FOUR.
[ct=715.296] >> Kirk: BONGA GAME BACK LAST
[ct=715.748] WEEK AGAINST CHICAGO AND HAD TO
[ct=717.005] DEAL WITH INJURIES THE LAST
[ct=719.566] COUPLE OF YEARS AND HAD ACL LAST
[ct=724.824] YEAR, AND DEALT WITH A WRITST
[ct=725.008] INJURY AND ANKLE INJURY.
[ct=728.995] YOU BRING HIM AND GREENLAW BACK
[ct=729.826] TO THIS DEFENSE AND IT’S A VERY
[ct=732.809] DIFFERENT LOOK.
[ct=738.267] >> Al: FOUR-MAN RUSH.
[ct=738.691] CLEAN POCKET.
[ct=745.525] LUCKY IT WASN’T PICKED.
[ct=750.233] RIGHT IN HIS CHEST AND CAN’T
[ct=752.161] HOLD WAS TONGA.
[ct=753.725] >> HE IS KNOWN FOR HIS ABILITY
[ct=755.616] TO COME UP IN RUN SPORT.
[ct=757.265] LIKE WE SAW THE LAST POSSESSION,
[ct=758.984] THEY ARE DOING A VERY GOOD JOB
[ct=761.340] OF ANTICIPATING THESE SHORTER
[ct=762.211] ROUTES AND JUMPING HIM.
[ct=763.803] HE IS RIGHT THERE.
[ct=764.377] BALL HITS HIM RIGHT OFF THE
[ct=765.443] CHEST.
[ct=768.101] THAT IS THE SECOND TIME THE
[ct=769.708] 49ers HAVE HAD A BALL IN THEIR
[ct=770.126] HANDS.
[ct=772.144] HE’S GOT THE CLUB THERE ON THAT
[ct=772.613] RIGHT HAND.
[ct=774.141] TOUGH TO BRING THAT ONE IN.
[ct=775.307] >> Al: TOO EASY.
[ct=776.228] HERE IS EVANS’ PUNT.
[ct=776.990] ANOTHER GOOD ONE.
[ct=781.147] FIELDED AT THE 10.
[ct=783.401] AND BROUGHT BACK TO THE 19 BY
[ct=783.582] JACOB COWING.
[ct=788.095] A PUNT OF 50 YARDS.
[ct=789.360] RETURN OF FIVE.
[ct=790.095] 8:21 TO GO IN THE OPENING
[ct=792.934] QUARTER.
[ct=792.934] 3-0 SAN FRANCISCO.
[ct=796.016] >> Kirk: MATTHEW STAFFORD IS
[ct=798.443] LOOKING OVER SOME THINGS.
[ct=800.136] EVENTUALLY, HE’LL SETTLE IN IN
[ct=801.620] THIS RAMS OFFENSE YOU THINK
[ct=802.343] WOULD GET GOING.
[ct=804.863] THE 49ers, WHILE THEIR DEFENSE
[ct=805.816] IS PLAYING WELL AND GETTING
[ct=807.388] STAFFORD OFF THE FIELD, THEY
[ct=808.716] HAVE GOT TO SEE IF THEY CAN
[ct=811.542] CAPITALIZE ON THESE CHANCES.
[ct=813.156] DEFENSE IS PLAYING GREAT.
[ct=819.738] >> Al: SAMUEL IS LINE UP IN THE
[ct=826.742] WIDE RECEIVER AND RUNNING BACK.
[ct=830.297] HERE HE GOES NOWHERE.
[ct=832.948] BUNCHED UP BY THE RAMS AT THE
[ct=833.120] LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=834.674] ROZEBOOM IS RIGHT THERE AND
[ct=836.344] LEADING TACKLER FOR THE TEAM.
[ct=836.964] SECOND DOWN.
[ct=837.603] >> Kirk: LIKE I SAID COMING IN
[ct=840.284] TO TONIGHT, 129 CARRIES SINCE
[ct=841.507] ENTERING THE LEAGUE IN 2019 AS A
[ct=842.327] RUNNING BACK.
[ct=843.252] I’M NOT INCLUDING THE JET
[ct=845.823] SWEEPS.
[ct=847.323] I’M TALKING ABOUT LINING OTHERS.
[ct=848.940] CHRISTIAN McCAFFREY, OF COURSE,
[ct=850.295] IS OUT.
[ct=851.357] SO YOU GET A LOT OF THE
[ct=851.948] INJURIES.
[ct=854.405] YOU TURN TO A GUY WHO IS A
[ct=856.431] PHYSICAL, TOUGH, GOOD FEEL FOR
[ct=857.082] RECEIVER IN THAT BACKFIELD.
[ct=860.968] >> Al: SECOND AND NINE.
[ct=866.339] CAUGHT BY SAMUEL.
[ct=866.554] TAKEN DOWN.
[ct=868.053] ANOTHER GUY, YOU KNOW, THAT WE
[ct=872.950] DON’T TALK ABOUT IS BRANDON
[ct=879.574] AIYUK, NOT PAEP HAEP WITH
[ct=880.933] AIYUK, NOT PAEP HHAPPY WITH HIS
[ct=882.664] CONTRACT AND GOT HURT AND OUT
[ct=883.848] FOR THE SEASON.
[ct=884.720] >> Kirk: HE WAS EVEN OFF TO A
[ct=885.757] SLOW START AT THE BEGINNING OF
[ct=887.068] THE SEASON WHEN HE WAS AVAILABLE
[ct=888.726] BECAUSE OF MISSING SO MUCH TIME
[ct=890.150] IN THE SUMMER.
[ct=891.223] SO THEN HE COMES BACK AND HE
[ct=892.129] GETS THE INJURY.
[ct=894.284] YOU TAKE OUT TRENT WILLIAMS, ONE
[ct=895.987] OF THE BEST TO EVER PLAY AT LEFT
[ct=896.727] TACKLE.
[ct=898.222] McCAFFREY.
[ct=899.320] IT’S REALLY PILED UP ON THE
[ct=899.510] NINERS.
[ct=899.937] >> Al: THIRD AND FOUR.
[ct=904.042] THAT PASS IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=904.889] THE COVERAGE IS THERE.
[ct=906.390] KITTLE LOOKS FOR A FLAG.
[ct=906.756] THERE IS NONE.
[ct=913.023] KAM PEARL DEFENDING ON THE PLAY.
[ct=913.703] AND IT’S FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=915.910] >> Kirk: WHAT A MATCHUP HERE AND
[ct=926.629] A TOUGH ASK OF KAM CURL BRINGING
[ct=926.784] STABILITY ON THE BACK END THIS
[ct=929.337] YEAR.
[ct=931.166] >> Al: IN A GAME ONLY 8:00 OLD,
[ct=933.119] BETWEEN TWO PRETTY HIGH SCORING
[ct=935.415] TEAMS, THIS IS ALREADY THE
[ct=937.042] FOURTH PUNT OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=938.163] O’DONNELL’S FIRST PUNT WAS 40
[ct=938.333] YARDS.
[ct=946.330] HE IS PLACING WISHNOWSKY WHO WAS
[ct=947.597] INJURED IN WEEK 11.
[ct=951.219] A SHORT KICK AND LET IT BOUNCE
[ct=952.561] AND IT TAKES A GOOD SAN
[ct=952.950] FRANCISCO BOUNCE AND TURNING
[ct=955.221] INTO A GREAT SAN FRANCISCO
[ct=956.366] BOUNCE.
[ct=957.808] AND DOWNED BACK AT THE 19 YARD
[ct=957.808] LINE.
[ct=961.460] NOT TOO PRETTY, BUT IT WINDS UP
[ct=962.015] VERY PRETTY ON T
[ct=964.556] >> Al: EACH OF THESE GUYS IN
[ct=964.556] THEIR EIGHTH YEAR.
[ct=968.490] SEAN McVAY GOT THE JOB AT THE
[ct=970.203] AGE OF 30.
[ct=971.337] HE HAD BEEN ON THE WASHINGTON
[ct=971.778] STAFF.
[ct=973.954] KYLE SHANAHAN HAD BEEN THE
[ct=975.331] ATLANTA OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR.
[ct=978.419] BOTH GETTING THEIR JOBS IN 2017.
[ct=979.757] LONG TIME BUDDIES AND LONG TIME
[ct=980.907] COLLEAGUES BEFORE THAT.
[ct=984.708] KYREN WILLIAMS IS THE RUNNING
[ct=985.341] PLAY ACTION.
[ct=985.769] GOOD PROTECTION.
[ct=988.307] AND THEN FINALLY HE HAS TO CHECK
[ct=989.326] IT DOWN.
[ct=991.060] WILLIAMS MAKES THAT GRAB BUT HE
[ct=992.793] IS SMOTHERED BY GREENLAW.
[ct=994.341] IN TALKING WITH SHANAHAN
[ct=996.046] YESTERDAY, HE WAS TALKING ABOUT
[ct=997.554] GREENLAW AND HE SAID HE REALLY
[ct=1000.648] THE GUY FOR THIS DEFENSE.
[ct=1006.404] THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE FOR HIM TO
[ct=1007.328] SAY THAT.
[ct=1007.507] I THINK FRED WARNER IS CLEARLY
[ct=1008.202] ONE OF THE TOP LINEBACKERS
[ct=1010.483] NOTICE LEAGUE BUT HE WILL TELL
[ct=1011.456] YOU IN THIS SCHEME AND HAVING
[ct=1014.086] GREENLAW OUT THERE AND THE
[ct=1014.707] ENERGY AND TOUGHNESS HE BRINGS,
[ct=1018.151] WARNER OUT.
[ct=1019.677] I THINK NOBODY IS HAPPIER TO SEE
[ct=1021.037] NUMBER 50 OUT THERE THAN FRED
[ct=1021.715] WARNER THERE IN THE MIDDLE.
[ct=1031.900] >> Al: WILLIAMS GETS TRIPPED UP
[ct=1035.920] BY GREENLAW AGAIN AND BY THE
[ct=1037.376] SHOELACES THAT TIME.
[ct=1038.102] THIRD DOWN.
[ct=1038.755] >> Kirk: IT’S INTERESTING THE
[ct=1040.371] FIRST TWO THROWS AND ESPECIALLY
[ct=1040.620] ON THIRD DOWN.
[ct=1042.091] THE SAFETIES FOR THE 49ers, THEY
[ct=1044.439] ARE IN THE MIND OF MATTHEW
[ct=1045.670] STAFFORD AND IT COULD BE
[ct=1046.729] INTERESTING TO SEE THE
[ct=1048.292] ADJUSTMENTS MADE BY SEAN McVAY
[ct=1049.926] BECAUSE, REMEMBER, BRANDON
[ct=1051.646] STALEY, WHO IS ON THE OTHER SIDE
[ct=1057.406] WHO HELPED YOU -- RIGHT NOW
[ct=1058.484] HELPING ASSISTANT COACH AND HE
[ct=1060.090] COACHED WITH THE RAMS AND McVAY
[ct=1061.283] IN 2020 AS A DEFENSIVE
[ct=1061.830] COORDINATOR.
[ct=1062.624] YOU WONDER HOW MUCH HE HAS
[ct=1064.916] HELPED THEM WITH THIS SCHEME
[ct=1065.866] BECAUSE THOSE SAFETIES ARE
[ct=1067.577] DIALED IN ON THIS TRIP.
[ct=1068.482] >> Al: GOOD POINT.
[ct=1072.183] THREE TO GO.
[ct=1073.293] STAFFORD HANGING IN THE POCKET.
[ct=1074.885] THROWING.
[ct=1075.062] TOO HIGH.
[ct=1075.374] INCOMPLETE.
[ct=1081.695] SO THE RAMS, WITH COVERAGE ON
[ct=1084.199] THE LAST PLAY, STILL WITHOUT A
[ct=1084.406] FIRST DOWN ALMOST 10:00
[ct=1087.437] >> Kirk: THEY ARE DOING A GOOD
[ct=1089.307] JOB DISRUPTING THE TIMING WITH
[ct=1090.468] STAFFED AND THESE RECEIVERS.
[ct=1092.200] MIXING UP COVERAGES AND LOOKS.
[ct=1094.549] TIGHT COVERAGE THERE WITH WARD
[ct=1097.826] GOING UP AGAINST COOPER KUPP IN
[ct=1098.531] REALLY TIGHT COVERAGE AT THE
[ct=1100.777] BEGINNING OF THAT ROUTE.
[ct=1101.752] STAFFORD LOOKED LEFT AND HAD TO
[ct=1103.024] COME ALL THE WAY BACK AND THINK
[ct=1104.336] BENEFIT, IT WAS TOO LATE TO GET
[ct=1106.578] THE BALL TO COOPER KUPP.
[ct=1107.633] >> Al: EVANS WITH HIS THIRD PUNT
[ct=1109.522] ALREADY OF THE GAME.
[ct=1117.645] THIS ONE IS SECURED AT THE 18
[ct=1119.515] LAST WEEK TALKING ABOUT DAN
[ct=1120.698] CAMPBELL AND THE MIXING AND
[ct=1121.625] MATCHING HE DID ON DEFENSE.
[ct=1124.740] YOU SAID AT THE TOP, THOUGH, YOU
[ct=1127.383] GOT SOME PRIME TIME GUYS THEY
[ct=1128.215] HAVE BEEN MISSING MOST OF THE
[ct=1128.968] SEASON OR AT LEAST PARTS OF ALL
[ct=1129.641] THE SEASON.
[ct=1132.242] FROM THE 22 YARD LINE, PURDY.
[ct=1133.905] THROWS TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=1135.797] HAULED IN BY JENNINGS.
[ct=1136.788] REALLY COMING ON.
[ct=1137.958] 12-YARD GAIN.
[ct=1139.950] KAYLEE?
[ct=1140.616] >> Kaylee: WITH THE INJURIES TO
[ct=1142.236] THE 49ers, GEORGE KITTLE TOLD ME
[ct=1143.462] THAT MEANS THEY HAVE LOST SOME
[ct=1144.471] EXPERIENCED PLAYERS WHO
[ct=1146.355] UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS URGENCY
[ct=1147.339] REQUIRED WHEN YOUR BACK IS
[ct=1148.921] AGAINST THE WALL LIKE THEIRS IS
[ct=1151.834] NOT EVERYONE ON THIS TEAM HAS
[ct=1152.720] FELT THAT DESPERATION BEFORE AND
[ct=1154.839] KITTLE DIDN’T FEEL IT CLICKED
[ct=1156.093] FOR THE YOUNG GUYS UNTIL LAST
[ct=1160.042] SUNDAY WHEN HE SAW THEM
[ct=1160.042] SCRATCHING AND SHR
[ct=1160.632] SCRATCHING AND SHCLAWING AND
[ct=1163.276] FIGHTING EVERY SINGLE SNAP.
[ct=1164.584] >> Al: THE GRIT HE SAID, WE ARE
[ct=1165.348] MISSING THE GRIT.
[ct=1169.164] PASS OVERT MIDDLE.
[ct=1169.844] PASS OVERT MI THE MIDDLE.
[ct=1173.959] GUERENDO MAKES THE PASS.
[ct=1175.507] TRENT WILLIAMS IS IT STILL OUT
[ct=1176.773] TONIGHT AT LEFT TACKLE.
[ct=1177.835] >> Kirk: HE SAID WE NEED THE
[ct=1179.521] GRIT BUT NEED TO SEE IT AS A
[ct=1180.248] TEAM.
[ct=1184.049] THERE IS TRENT WILLIAMS, A BIG
[ct=1185.185] GRILT OF THE
[ct=1186.402] GRIT OF THE OFFENSIVE LINE AND
[ct=1187.356] NOT BECAUSE OF HIS TALENT BUT
[ct=1188.009] BECAUSE OF HIS PRESENCE AND WHAT
[ct=1190.360] HIS PRESENCE MEANS TO THAT
[ct=1192.368] OFFENSIVE LINE AND KIND OF THE
[ct=1197.807] PERSONALITY BY THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=1199.487] >> Al: JAYLEN MOORE WILL PLAY
[ct=1201.750] THAT ROLE AGAINST WILLIAMS COMES
[ct=1205.663] GUERENDO FIGHTS AND ANGLES HIS
[ct=1207.264] WAY PAST THE 45 FOR A FIRST DOWN
[ct=1208.331] FOR SAN FRANCISCO.
[ct=1209.274] YOUNG MAKES THE STOP.
[ct=1210.402] >> Kirk: THAT IS WHERE YOU FIND
[ct=1211.869] OUT HOW THAT FOOT IS DOING WHEN
[ct=1212.842] YOU HAVE TO RUN THROUGH SOME
[ct=1213.984] TACKLES.
[ct=1217.415] HE RAN RIGHT THROUGH KOBIE
[ct=1218.774] TURNER.
[ct=1219.460] 91 IS CHASING HIM.
[ct=1220.622] HE EVENTUALLY BOUNCES RIGHT OFF
[ct=1221.308] OF HIM.
[ct=1222.282] THAT EXTRA EFFORT, THAT SPIN
[ct=1224.695] GETS HIM THAT FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1226.524] SO FAR, THAT FOOT IS HOLDING UP
[ct=1227.637] VERY NICELY FOR HIM.
[ct=1231.915] >> Al: FOUR CARRIES FOR HIM, 11
[ct=1233.666] 3:30 LEFT IN THE QUARTER AND SAN
[ct=1234.995] FRANCISCO LEADING 3-0.
[ct=1236.919] KITTLE IS THE MOTION MAN.
[ct=1239.542] AGAIN, THEY GIVE IT TO GUERENDO.
[ct=1241.037] TALK ABOUT THE THE GUYS THEY ARE
[ct=1242.554] MISSING AND McCAFFREY IS NUMBER
[ct=1243.471] ONE.
[ct=1245.470] JORDAN MASON HAS DONE A NICE JOB
[ct=1246.835] AND ELIJAH MITCHELL WOULD BE
[ct=1248.206] NUMBER THREE AND DOWN THE LIST
[ct=1251.476] HERE TO GUERENDO.
[ct=1253.437] >> Kirk: IF GUGUERENDO’S FOOT
[ct=1255.703] DOESN’T HOLD UP, PATRICK TAYLOR
[ct=1256.420] OUT OF MEMPHIS WOULD BE NUMBER
[ct=1257.912] FIVE AND, OF COURSE, DEEBO
[ct=1259.353] SAMUEL WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP OUT
[ct=1259.949] AS WELL.
[ct=1263.842] IT’S BEEN THAT KIND OF YEAR.
[ct=1266.208] >> Al: THERE IS TAYLOR.
[ct=1267.635] HE SAW A LITTLE BIT OF ACTION
[ct=1267.970] LAST WEEK.
[ct=1269.560] NOT MUCH BEFORE THAT.
[ct=1270.685] SECOND DOWN AND SIX.
[ct=1274.766] BALL RIGHT ON THE 50.
[ct=1277.357] KNOCKED DOWN.
[ct=1279.678] FOR A PLAY THERE BY WITHER
[ct=1284.953] SAMOAN COMING UP FOR COBIE
[ct=1286.405] DURANT WHO IS HURT.
[ct=1287.063] >> Kirk: SECOND TIME TRIED HIM
[ct=1290.133] TO THE QUICK SLANT AND BOTH
[ct=1290.319] TIMES HE HAS DONE A GOOD JOB OF
[ct=1292.471] POSITIONING HIMSELF NOT TO KNOCK
[ct=1292.731] THE BALL AWAY.
[ct=1293.764] REMEMBER, HE IS A VETERAN.
[ct=1297.044] HE REALLY HAS A FEEL.
[ct=1297.044] YOU CAN SEE JENNINGS TRIED TO
[ct=1298.294] SELL HIM LIKE HE WAS GOING DOWN
[ct=1299.920] THE FIELD AND GOING BY HIM ON A
[ct=1301.600] GO ROUTE AND THEN PUT THE BRAKES
[ct=1303.651] ON, BUT NOT FOOLED AT ALL.
[ct=1305.022] A REALLY GOOD JOB DEFENDING
[ct=1305.789] THAT.
[ct=1308.844] >> Al: FORMER 49er AND SEVENTH
[ct=1309.031] YEAR IN THE LEAGUE IS
[ct=1310.193] WITHERSPOON.
[ct=1319.711] THIRD DOWN AND SIX NOW.
[ct=1321.829] JUSTICE JUSZCZYK IN THE
[ct=1325.020] THEY GET PURDY AT THE 46 YARD
[ct=1328.630] KOBIE TURNER NUMBER 91.
[ct=1331.694] THE REPEAT "MASKED SINGER" FAME
[ct=1332.441] GETS THE SACK.
[ct=1333.422] >> Kirk: THEY SHOW PRESSURE AND
[ct=1333.953] ONLY BRING FOUR.
[ct=1335.458] YOU SEE HIM WALK UP.
[ct=1337.007] YOUNG DROPS BUT THERE IS A NICE
[ct=1337.544] STUNT THERE.
[ct=1340.377] I THINK IT CAUSED ENOUGH
[ct=1345.345] CONFUSION THERE THAT EVENTUALLY
[ct=1346.615] NOBODY DOWN THE FIELD AND THEY
[ct=1349.227] COLLAPSE THE POCKET ON PURDY.
[ct=1350.610] >> Al: O’DONNELL WITH HIS
[ct=1351.614] PUNT.
[ct=1352.266] SIXTH PUNT OF THE QUARTER.
[ct=1359.855] FAIR CATCH CALLED FOR AND MADE
[ct=1363.836] AT THE 16 YARD LINE BY XAVIER
[ct=1364.363] SMITH.
[ct=1365.555] EXACTL IN CIVIL
[ct=1366.539] RIGHTS AND PRESENTED TWO SUPER
[ct=1367.242] BOWL TICKETS.
[ct=1368.553] HE HAS BEEN A GREAT MENTOR FOR A
[ct=1369.159] LOT OF ATHLETES.
[ct=1371.365] I GOT TO KNOW HIM THROUGH THE
[ct=1373.053] YEARS.
[ct=1373.386] ACROSS ALL SPORTS.
[ct=1375.790] CONGRATULATIONS TO DR. EDWARDS.
[ct=1380.014] >> Kirk: ABSOLUTELY.
[ct=1381.465] >> Al: SPRINGS KLES NOW.
[ct=1383.886] SHOWERS OFF AND ON.
[ct=1386.853] RAMS LOOKING FOR A FIRST DOWN
[ct=1389.190] FOR THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT.
[ct=1390.271] >> Kirk: SPEAKING OF FIRST TIME.
[ct=1392.823] GREAT TO SEE DRE GREENLAW BACK
[ct=1393.002] PLAYING FOOTBALL.
[ct=1394.402] HE HAD THE INJURY THAT AL TALKED
[ct=1399.629] ABOUT AND JOGGING OUT ON THE
[ct=1400.287] FIELD IN THE SUPER BOWL AND TORE
[ct=1402.301] HIS ACHILLES.
[ct=1402.708] HE LOOKED TODAY LIKE HE IS
[ct=1403.478] PLAYING IN ANOTHER SUPER BOWL.
[ct=1405.177] HE HAS WORKED SO HARD FOR THIS
[ct=1405.970] MOMENT.
[ct=1407.533] HE’S BEEN ON THE FIELD NOW FOR
[ct=1410.832] ALL 11 SNAPS FOR THIS 49ers
[ct=1412.360] DEFENSE AND IS FLYING AROUND.
[ct=1413.721] >> Al: NO PITCH COUNT FOR HIM,
[ct=1414.734] AT LEAST TO THIS POINT OF THE
[ct=1417.870] BUT, FOR THE MOMENT NOW, FRED
[ct=1418.964] WARNER IS PLAYING WITH A BROKEN
[ct=1420.256] BONE IN HIS ANKLE SINCE EARLY IN
[ct=1422.467] THE SEASON AND WAS FLEXING THE
[ct=1424.240] LEG AND HE WALKS OUT AND HAS TO
[ct=1425.726] BE OUT FOR AT LEAST ONE PLAY.
[ct=1428.478] >> Kirk: HE PLAYS SO HARD.
[ct=1429.927] I THINK AT THE END OF THIS PLAY,
[ct=1433.850] HE KIND OF GETS NEAR MAKE THE
[ct=1436.402] PLAY AND RIGHT THERE, JUST THE
[ct=1438.022] WAY HE LANDED.
[ct=1438.918] WATCH THIS.
[ct=1440.360] JUST AWKWARD THE WAY HE CAME
[ct=1441.893] NOBODY PLAYS HARDER THAN FRED
[ct=1442.107] WARNER.
[ct=1448.727] >> Al: SECOND AND SEVEN.
[ct=1451.392] HAS TO CHECK IT DOWN!
[ct=1453.995] HE IS LUCKY THAT ONE WASN’T
[ct=1455.585] PICKED.
[ct=1457.122] BLAKE CORUM, THE INTENDED
[ct=1458.115] RECEIVER AND WHO ELSE IS OVER
[ct=1458.670] THERE?
[ct=1459.670] GREENLAW.
[ct=1463.673] THIRD AND SEVEN.
[ct=1464.937] GREEN SHORTSTOP LAW IS ALL OVER
[ct=1466.604] GREENLAW IS ALL OVER THE PLACE.
[ct=1466.781] >> HE IS.
[ct=1468.441] BLAKE CORUM, WATCHING HIM IN
[ct=1469.430] COLLEGE A NUMBER OF YEARS IN
[ct=1470.194] MICHIGAN.
[ct=1470.994] THE ROOKIE CAN CATCH THE
[ct=1473.227] VERY SIMILAR BACK STYLE WISE TO
[ct=1477.807] KYREN WILLIAMS.
[ct=1478.966] THE BALL JUST GOES RIGHT OFF HIS
[ct=1481.862] WE GOT ANOTHER THIRD DOWN.
[ct=1482.802] WE HAVE NOT SEEN EITHER TEAM
[ct=1485.885] CONVERT A THIRD DOWN YET
[ct=1486.372] TONIGHT.
[ct=1487.467] >> Al: RAMS DON’T HAVE A FIRST
[ct=1489.097] WARNER IS BACK IN.
[ct=1495.727] ATWELL IS THE MAN IN MOTION.
[ct=1497.207] GOING THAT WAY.
[ct=1497.932] AND TOO HIGH.
[ct=1500.498] INTENDED FOR DeMARCUS ROBINSON.
[ct=1502.457] WARD COVERING ON THE PLAY.
[ct=1505.360] SO THE RAMS, WITHOUT A FIRST
[ct=1508.409] DOWN, AND WE ARE, FOLKS, GOING
[ct=1509.412] TO HAVE OUR SEVENTH PUNT OF THE
[ct=1513.690] >> Kirk: BOY, THIS 49ers
[ct=1515.422] SECONDARY IS REALLY DOING A GOOD
[ct=1517.717] JOB OF MIXING UP THE LOOKS AND
[ct=1519.402] KEEPING STAFFORD AND THESE
[ct=1520.526] RECEIVERS GUESSING.
[ct=1522.317] STAFFORD, WHO CAME IN PLAYING AS
[ct=1524.361] WELL AS ANYBODY THESE LAST FOUR
[ct=1525.781] WEEKS JUST LOOKS UNSETTLED AND
[ct=1526.945] HASN’T BEEN ABLE TO FIND HIS
[ct=1528.846] RHYTHM YET WITHIN THE OFFENSE.
[ct=1533.163] >> Al: EVANS WITH A LINE DRIVE
[ct=1534.106] KICK BUT A LOT OF DISTANCE AND
[ct=1536.210] IT’S A BEAUTY AS IT TURNS OUT.
[ct=1539.292] IT’S FIELDED BACK AT THE 14 YARD
[ct=1539.904] LINE BY COWING.
[ct=1542.205] HE BRINGS IT BACK OUT TO THE 30
[ct=1544.131] THAT WAS ON A LINE.
[ct=1545.456] BUT FOR SURE.
[ct=1549.418] AGAIN, LIGHT RAIN COMING DOWN.
[ct=1552.433] FOUR STRAIGHT DRIVES WITHOUT A
[ct=1553.228] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1555.018] >> Kirk: HOW ABOUT ABOUT THAT?
[ct=1555.770] >> Al: FIRST TIME THAT HAS
[ct=1559.135] HAPPENED TO SEAN McVAY.
[ct=1559.516] 49ers HAVE THREE FIRST DOWNS AND
[ct=1559.806] THREE POINTS.
[ct=1563.063] THE PASS IS CAUGHT BUT ONLY A
[ct=1567.290] ONE-YARD GAIN BY GUERENDO AND
[ct=1568.718] TAKEN DOWN BY MICHAEL HOYT.
[ct=1571.366] >> Kirk: ONE OF THE FIRST WE
[ct=1573.998] WILL SEE OF HIM TONIGHT AND SEE
[ct=1574.624] ON BOTH SIDES.
[ct=1575.794] THE TIMING OF THAT DIDN’T WORK
[ct=1577.706] OUT TO GET THE LINEMAN DOWN THE
[ct=1578.405] FIELD.
[ct=1579.905] THE RAMS DEFENSE, YOU TALKED
[ct=1580.344] ABOUT EARLIER.
[ct=1582.314] I THINK SEAN McVAY AND LES SNEAD
[ct=1585.211] ARE PROUD OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN
[ct=1587.852] ABLE TO BUILD HERE WITH THE
[ct=1598.108] YOUNG NUCLEUS OF PLAYERS.
[ct=1599.025] >> Al: WHEN THE 49ers CHANGED
[ct=1600.926] REGIMES AND SHANAHAN CAME IN
[ct=1602.320] WITH JOHN LYNCH, FIRST THING
[ct=1606.164] THEY DID WAS BUILD THAT
[ct=1606.960] DEFENSIVE FRONT.
[ct=1610.330] GET A PASS RUSH.
[ct=1610.748] NOW THE RAMS ARE THE TEAM THAT
[ct=1612.095] FLIPPED IT ON THE 49ers.
[ct=1614.853] >> Kirk: I THINK THEY HAD TO.
[ct=1616.205] SO MUCH CONCERN.
[ct=1617.018] WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITHOUT AARON
[ct=1618.004] DONALD?
[ct=1619.213] THEY FOUND NOT ONE BUT FIVE OR
[ct=1620.813] SIX GUYS TO TRY TO HELP MAKE
[ct=1621.976] THAT A STRENGTH ACROSS THE
[ct=1622.573] BOARD.
[ct=1625.903] >> Al: THERE IS JOHN LYNCH.
[ct=1628.102] THE RAIN IS COMING DOWN A LITTLE
[ct=1628.602] BIT HARDER
[ct=1630.704] >> Al: END OF ONE.
[ct=1635.848] 3-0, SAN FRANCISCO ON TOP.
[ct=1637.410] NEXT WEEK, FIRST-EVER THURSDAY
[ct=1641.607] NIGHT FLEX GAME AS WE GO TO LOS
[ct=1641.931] ANGELES.
[ct=1644.726] BRONCOS AND CHARGERS PRETTY MUCH
[ct=1645.947] IN THE PLAYOFF HUNT AND KANSAS
[ct=1650.251] CITY ON TOP OF THAT TWDIVISION.
[ct=1650.936] DENVER AND LOS ANGELES TRYING TO
[ct=1652.612] GET TO THE TOURNAMENT NEXT
[ct=1654.379] THURSDAY NIGHT.
[ct=1660.447] WE START HERE FROM THE 36 YARD
[ct=1661.038] LINE, THIRD DOWN AND FOUR.
[ct=1664.419] A FLAG HERE.
[ct=1666.241] >> Kirk: DEEBO SAMUEL MOVING A
[ct=1667.003] LITTLE EARLY.
[ct=1668.757] >> Referee: FALSE START, OFFENSE
[ct=1669.650] NUMBER 1.
[ct=1672.410] FIVE-YARD PENALTY.
[ct=1675.043] >> Al: SAMUEL.
[ct=1679.083] THIRD AND NINE NOW.
[ct=1680.139] >> Kirk: HE WAS JUST ANXIOUS TO
[ct=1683.459] GET OUT OF HIS STANCE AND TRY TO
[ct=1685.290] GET DOWN FIELD HERE.
[ct=1689.030] HE JUMPS A LITTLE BIT EARLY.
[ct=1690.396] HE TALKS ABOUT TOUCHES AND
[ct=1691.147] OPPORTUNITIES.
[ct=1694.394] HE HAS FOUR TOUCHES, A COUPLE OF
[ct=1695.945] CARRIES, A COUPLE OF RECEPTIONS
[ct=1698.263] ALREADY TONIGHT.
[ct=1699.235] >> Al: PENALTY-FREE GAME TO TH
[ct=1699.625] POINT.
[ct=1702.570] EACH TEAM WITH ONE.
[ct=1704.795] THAT PASS -- OF COURSE, THE
[ct=1706.517] MINUTE I SAY IT, HERE COMES A
[ct=1708.835] FLAG AS JAUAN JENNINGS MAKES THE
[ct=1709.841] CATCH AND HE IS OUT OF BOUNDS ON
[ct=1710.627] THE RAMS SIDE OF THE FIELD.
[ct=1714.770] >> Kirk: YEAH, ARE THEY GETTING
[ct=1717.050] THAT ON THE DEFENSE FOR GRABBING
[ct=1717.407] ON?
[ct=1719.655] WITHERSPOON IS THERE IN COVERAGE
[ct=1720.848] AGAINST JENNINGS.
[ct=1723.125] >> Al: 49ers SEEM TO THINK SO AS
[ct=1724.964] THEY ARE MOVING UP TOWARD
[ct=1727.059] MIDFIELD.
[ct=1729.158] >> Kirk: HANDLING THE FOOTBALL
[ct=1729.368] PRETTY WELL.
[ct=1731.425] HE HAS A BIG HAND.
[ct=1735.384] THROWING A PRETTY TIGHT SPIRAL
[ct=1735.384] HERE.
[ct=1736.871] >> Referee: HOLDING DEFENSE
[ct=1737.614] NUMBER 4.
[ct=1738.997] >> Kirk: HE LOVES THE OUT CUT
[ct=1741.417] AND TIMING OF THAT AND JENNINGS
[ct=1742.971] HAS HAD TO STEP UP FOR THIS
[ct=1744.048] OFFENSE.
[ct=1744.661] WEEK THREE WHEN HE WENT UP
[ct=1746.272] AGAINST THE RAMS, HE HAD A
[ct=1749.941] MONSTER GAME WITH 11 CATCHES AND
[ct=1752.407] 175 YARDS AND THREE TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=1753.387] I FEEL THE OFFENSE AND THE
[ct=1755.207] WEATHER AND THE RESPECT THEY
[ct=1756.357] HAVE FOR EACH OTHER’S DEFENSE
[ct=1758.920] ARE JUST FEELING EACH OTHER OUT
[ct=1760.393] AND EVENTUALLY LOOKING FOR SOME
[ct=1761.315] BIGGER SHOTS DOWN FIELD.
[ct=1763.716] >> Al: WE ARE ONLY IN A THIRD
[ct=1765.620] ROUND OF A FIGHT AND TRYING TO
[ct=1766.615] FIGURE IT OUT.
[ct=1766.697] GUERENDO GOES NOWHERE.
[ct=1770.402] SECOND DOWN AND LONG.
[ct=1772.911] >> Kirk: ROZEBOOM WHO LEADS THE
[ct=1773.867] RAMS IN TACKLES.
[ct=1777.447] THE RAMS UP FRONT, WE WERE
[ct=1778.894] BRAGGING ABOUT THEIR DEFENSIVE
[ct=1780.294] LINE AND THEY DO A PRETTY GOOD
[ct=1781.603] JOB KEEPING HIM CLEAN.
[ct=1784.051] YOU’LL SEE HIM IN THE RUN GAME
[ct=1785.170] AND SO IMPORTANT WHEN YOU DEFEND
[ct=1787.315] KYLE SHANAHAN.
[ct=1791.573] HE GETS DOWNHILL AND MAKES A LOT
[ct=1791.573] OF TACKLES.
[ct=1796.516] >> Al: SHANAHAN IS PACING AND
[ct=1797.057] TRYING TO GET A BETTER LOOK FROM
[ct=1798.304] A DIFFERENT ANGLE.
[ct=1798.513] 50 YARD LINE.
[ct=1798.966] SECOND DOWN AND NINE.
[ct=1805.266] GOING DEEP!
[ct=1810.587] AND A LOT OF CONTACT.
[ct=1815.622] A LOT OF ACTION BUT THERE IS NO
[ct=1816.853] FLAG.
[ct=1818.681] KAM CURL IS THERE WITH GEORGE
[ct=1820.575] KITTLE.
[ct=1821.204] GOOD BATTLE.
[ct=1822.887] >> Kirk: THEY FLEXED HIM OUT AND
[ct=1824.497] MOTION BY DEEBO SAMUEL AND THAT
[ct=1825.867] CREATES A ONE-ON-ONE OPPORTUNITY
[ct=1827.146] WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THE NINERS
[ct=1829.714] WANT.
[ct=1831.152] WE SAW CURL EARLIER GO
[ct=1832.786] ONE-ON-ONE WITH A SHORTER ROUTE
[ct=1835.470] AND NOW HE IS DOWN FIELD AND
[ct=1836.376] NEVER REALLY FINDS THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=1837.826] I THINK THERE IS CONTACT THERE.
[ct=1838.789] VERY EASILY COULD HAVE BEEN A
[ct=1840.395] CALL AND THE MAIN REASON IS THE
[ct=1842.063] CONTACT AND WITHOUT GETTING A
[ct=1844.447] HEAD TURNED AROUND.
[ct=1845.893] >> Al: KEPT THE FLAG IN THE
[ct=1846.295] POCKET.
[ct=1847.118] BUT IT’S THIRD DOWN AND NINE.
[ct=1851.583] PURDY UNDER PRESSURE.
[ct=1854.556] FIRES IN TO TRAFFIC AND JENNINGS
[ct=1856.091] WAS THE INTENDED RECEIVER AND
[ct=1859.264] JENNINGS CAN’T HOLD ON.
[ct=1859.264] FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=1865.274] >> Kirk: KOBI TURNER HERE.
[ct=1868.384] HE DOESN’T GET A SACK BUT IT
[ct=1869.953] JUST GIVES YOU AN IDEA HOW
[ct=1870.883] POWERFUL THIS GUY IS.
[ct=1872.721] HE ALWAYS KEEPS -- PEOPLE KEEP
[ct=1874.351] REFERRING TO HIM -- NO ONE IS
[ct=1875.896] EVER THE NEXT AARON DONALD BUT
[ct=1878.164] HE IS A GUY THAT HAS KIND OF
[ct=1879.155] MOVED INTO THAT POSITION.
[ct=1881.461] HE HAS GOT QUICKNESS.
[ct=1882.109] THAT TIME, HE SHOWS SOME POWER
[ct=1883.529] ON THAT RUSH.
[ct=1886.802] >> Al: O’DONNELL’S PUNT.
[ct=1888.866] CALLED FOR A FAIR CATCH AND THEN
[ct=1890.181] LET IT BOUNCE AND TRIED TO FOOL
[ct=1895.285] THE 49ers BUT, NO, SIR.
[ct=1898.955] DOWN AT THE 2 YARD LINE BY
[ct=1900.726] TONGES.
[ct=1901.037] 49ers ON TOP
[ct=1902.708] >> Kirk: HOW MANY TIMES YOU
[ct=1903.965] WATCH A GAME ON THE WEEKEND
[ct=1907.186] WHERE THE GUNNER NEVER FINDS THE
[ct=1907.392] FOOTBALL?
[ct=1909.116] VERY DISCIPLINED JOB OF COMING
[ct=1910.056] DOWN FIELD.
[ct=1910.706] WELL SCHOOLED.
[ct=1911.969] JUST LOOKING FOR THE BALL.
[ct=1913.083] FINDS THE BALL.
[ct=1915.121] AND THEN JUST IS AWARE OF WHERE
[ct=1917.626] THAT GOAL LINE IS AND KEEPS HIS
[ct=1918.242] FEET AND THE BALL OUTSIDE OF THE
[ct=1919.019] GOAL LINE.
[ct=1922.216] GREAT JOB.
[ct=1924.580] >> Al: SO THE RAMS NOW 13 PLAYS
[ct=1927.073] FOR 23 YARDS.
[ct=1929.441] A TEAM THAT SCORED 44 POINTS
[ct=1930.763] FOUR DAYS AGO.
[ct=1937.919] A LITTLE BIT OF A HOLE THAT
[ct=1938.625] CLOSES QUICKLY FOR KYREN
[ct=1938.952] WILLIAMS.
[ct=1943.767] 44 POINTS.
[ct=1946.591] THEY COULDN’T STOP THEM, BUFFALO
[ct=1948.917] LAST WEEK BUT TONIGHT, THEY JUST
[ct=1950.627] NOW GET A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1950.917] >> Kirk: SO TRUE.
[ct=1956.888] ONE WEEK TO THE NEXT IN THE NFL.
[ct=1958.195] SEAN McVAY NOT JUST LAST WEEK
[ct=1960.956] BUT THE LAST THREE OR FOUR WEEKS
[ct=1963.763] MOMENTUM.
[ct=1965.352] GREAT TO SEE FRED WARNER FLYING
[ct=1966.580] AROUND AFTER GOING OFF THE
[ct=1969.091] >> Al: HE JUST MISSED ONE PLAY.
[ct=1969.475] SECOND AND EIGHT.
[ct=1974.197] KEEP IT ON THE GROUND.
[ct=1974.383] NICE MOVE.
[ct=1975.768] THERE IS YOUR INITIAL FIRST DOWN
[ct=1979.029] FOR THE RAMS TONIGHT.
[ct=1980.498] KYREN WILLIAMS SPINNING HIS WAY
[ct=1984.567] TO A FIRST DOWN AT THE 15 YARD
[ct=1987.872] >> Kirk: BEAU LIMMER A GOOD JOB
[ct=1989.615] AT THE SECOND LEVEL.
[ct=1991.099] HOW ABOUT THE TWO RECEIVERS?
[ct=1992.858] PUKA NACUA, 17.
[ct=1994.187] COOPER KUPP HELPING OUT AS WELL.
[ct=1995.332] BOTH GUYS ARE WILLING.
[ct=1997.624] YOU KNOW, ONE THING ABOUT THIS
[ct=2000.017] RAMS OFFENSE IS THE RECEIVERS
[ct=2001.206] GET UP THERE AND THEY BLOCK.
[ct=2002.141] NOT JUST BLOCKING CORNERS BUT
[ct=2005.321] THEY GET IN THERE AND BLOCK
[ct=2006.183] LINEBACKERS AND SAFETIES AND
[ct=2007.849] GOOD TOUGH RUNNING THAT TIME BY
[ct=2010.974] >> Al: TOSS.
[ct=2015.166] HUH-UH.
[ct=2018.293] RIGHT THERE WHO TAKES HIM DOWN
[ct=2019.067] FOR A LOSS.
[ct=2020.643] NOT FOOLED.
[ct=2021.557] >> Kirk: IF YOU’RE A NINERS FAN,
[ct=2024.598] YOU THINK WHY COULDN’T WE HAVE
[ct=2025.654] BEEN HEALTHY ALL YEAR?
[ct=2032.777] GREENLAW IS BACK AND FUNGA COMES
[ct=2034.330] BACK LAST WEEK.
[ct=2036.311] THEY GO TO A CRACK TOSS.
[ct=2037.810] HE GETS OUT THERE AND GETS OFF
[ct=2038.654] THAT BLOCK.
[ct=2041.410] I THINK HE IS A GREAT DEFENDER
[ct=2043.293] AND PLAYING WITH INSTINCTS.
[ct=2048.657] NOT JUST AGAINST THE RUN BUT
[ct=2049.224] PLAYS WITH DISCIPLINE AND BACK
[ct=2050.419] END AS WELL.
[ct=2051.647] >> Al: SECOND DOWN AND 12.
[ct=2053.853] STAFFORD IS 2 OF 8.
[ct=2056.597] HE HANDS THE BALL OFF HERE TO
[ct=2059.715] THE 15 YARD LINE.
[ct=2063.481] FRED WARNER TAKES HIM DOWN.
[ct=2063.481] IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN.
[ct=2064.702] >> Kirk: REMEMBER, THIS IS AN
[ct=2066.560] OFFENSIVE LINE THAT FINALLY
[ct=2068.354] GOTTEN HEALTHY.
[ct=2069.653] THEY HAVE HAD SOME INJURIES THE
[ct=2070.536] LAST FEW WEEKS.
[ct=2071.596] THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THE
[ct=2073.252] PIECES TOGETHER.
[ct=2074.610] THEY PLAYED A LOT OF FOOTBALL
[ct=2075.903] TOGETHER AND THEY ARE FINDING IT
[ct=2079.419] TO BE VERY, VERY TOUGH AGAINST
[ct=2080.824] THIS SAN FRANCISCO DEFENSE HERE
[ct=2083.287] ON A THURSDAY NIGHT.
[ct=2085.482] >> Al: SEVEN DIFFERENT OFFENSIVE
[ct=2086.690] LINE COMBINATIONS FOR THE RAMS.
[ct=2091.136] STAFFORD IS 2 OF 8 FOR 11 YARDS.
[ct=2094.076] AFTER HE HAD A MONSTER GAME ON
[ct=2094.723] SUNDAY.
[ct=2094.723] DEEP DROP.
[ct=2099.268] ESCAPING.
[ct=2100.924] GOING RUN AND PICK UP THAT FIRST
[ct=2102.362] DOWN AND WARNER TRIED TO TAKE
[ct=2104.079] THE BALL AWAY AFTER THE PLAY WAS
[ct=2108.351] WHISTLED DEAD.
[ct=2109.796] FIRST DOWN, LOS ANGELES.
[ct=2110.859] >> Kirk: WHEN IT’S THIRD DOWN
[ct=2112.561] LIKE THAT, AL, IT’S A GREAT JOB,
[ct=2114.124] IN MY OPINION, OF NOT SLIDING.
[ct=2116.982] STAFFORD AT 36 YEARS OLD, GREAT
[ct=2117.037] AWARENESS.
[ct=2119.114] RUNNING AWAY FROM BOSA.
[ct=2121.913] SOMETIMES YOU SLIDE, THEY BRING
[ct=2122.291] IT ALL THE WAY BACK BECAUSE IT’S
[ct=2123.123] WHERE THAT KNEE TOUCHES.
[ct=2124.085] HERE, HE GOES FORWARD AND IS
[ct=2124.643] ABLE TO GET THAT FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2129.550] >> Al: OF COURSE, THE FLIP SIDE
[ct=2129.550] IS SOMETIMES YOU GO HEAD FIRST
[ct=2132.236] AND YOU’RE BACK IN THE TENT.
[ct=2133.190] >> Kirk: THAT’S TRUE.
[ct=2136.487] BUT HE PROTECTED HIMSELF THERE.
[ct=2137.456] >> Al: BALL AT THE 26.
[ct=2140.879] QUICK THROW HERE.
[ct=2144.505] PUKA GETS A LOT OF YARDS AFTER
[ct=2145.951] CONTACT AS IS NORMAL.
[ct=2148.362] BOSA MAKES A STOP THERE.
[ct=2149.933] >> Kirk: BOSA WAS EXPECTING THAT
[ct=2151.339] BALL TO POTENTIALLY BE COMING
[ct=2151.339] OUT.
[ct=2154.000] HE KIND OF LOOKS AT IT FLY OVER
[ct=2154.543] HIS HEAD.
[ct=2155.778] INSTEAD OF GIVING UP ON IT, THIS
[ct=2157.060] IS WHAT YOU LOVE TO SEE FROM
[ct=2157.955] NICK BOSA.
[ct=2159.511] THE SUPERSTAR SEES IT AND
[ct=2160.920] INSTEAD OF GIVING UP ON IT, HE
[ct=2161.270] GOES FULL SPEED AND CHASES IT
[ct=2165.112] THIS IS MORE OF WHAT THE RAMS
[ct=2165.405] EXPECTED.
[ct=2167.940] REMEMBER, THEY STARTED THIS
[ct=2168.169] DRIVE AFTER A REALLY ROUGH NIGHT
[ct=2169.753] ON THEIR OWN 2 YARD LINE AND
[ct=2172.893] PICKING UP A FEW FIRST DOWNS
[ct=2174.818] >> Al: SECOND AND TWO.
[ct=2183.591] AND GETTING THOSE TWO IS KYREN
[ct=2188.458] RAMS NOW THREE FIRST DOWNS
[ct=2189.693] THIS DRIVE STARTING AT THEIR OWN
[ct=2190.953] 2 YARD LINE.
[ct=2194.238] >> Kirk: THIS IS THE RHYTHM THAT
[ct=2194.884] THEY TALK ABOUT.
[ct=2197.675] McVAY REMINDING US THIS WEEK
[ct=2198.563] ABOUT STAFFORD AND THESE
[ct=2199.891] RECEIVERS, THEY ARE HEALTHY AND
[ct=2200.910] GO TO A LOT OF ATTENTION.
[ct=2202.547] HE SAID MAKE NO MISTAKE, WHEN
[ct=2205.854] OUR LINE HEALTHY, THIS ENTIRE
[ct=2206.947] OPERATION STARTS WITH OUR
[ct=2208.271] ABILITY TO RUN THE BALL.
[ct=2210.088] EVEN WHEN WE TALKED ON THE OTHER
[ct=2214.505] SIDE, KYLE HAND SHAUN
[ct=2215.754] SIDE, KYLE HANDSHANAHAN SAID IF
[ct=2218.265] CAN’T STOP THEM FROM RUNNING,
[ct=2219.057] IT’S A LONG NIGHT FOR OUR
[ct=2219.816] DEFENSE.
[ct=2221.351] THAT IS THE BATTLE UP FRONT AT
[ct=2223.027] THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=2223.342] >> Al: STAFFORD.
[ct=2226.927] EYES DOWN THE FIELD.
[ct=2231.368] NACUA THE INTENDED RECEIVER.
[ct=2231.629] THROWN OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=2232.053] SECOND AND TEN.
[ct=2235.462] >> Kirk: NINERS DOING A GREAT
[ct=2237.320] JOB WITH JUST THEIR FRONT AND
[ct=2238.917] ABLE TO APPLY THAT PRESSURE.
[ct=2239.940] THEY GOT TO STAFFORD.
[ct=2240.856] HERE IS PUKA.
[ct=2243.779] LOOK AT HIM ON HIS ROUTE AND
[ct=2244.965] GETTING BEHIND ROBINSON AND
[ct=2246.686] TRYING TO JUST USE HIM AS A
[ct=2247.973] SHIELD BUT THEY HAVE GOT HIM
[ct=2249.533] LOCKED DOWN.
[ct=2250.866] LOOK.
[ct=2253.180] YOU HAVE FOUR DIFFERENT 49ers
[ct=2253.923] AROUND NUMBER 17.
[ct=2256.191] THAT IS ONE WAY TO STOP HIM.
[ct=2256.527] >> Al: YEAH.
[ct=2257.561] >> Kirk: THERE IS THE PRESSURE
[ct=2263.360] AGAIN ON STAFFORD.
[ct=2264.582] >> Al: CONNRNERS COVERAGE.
[ct=2269.989] HE RUNS INTO HIS OWN MAN.
[ct=2272.612] HE RAN INTO HUNTER LONG.
[ct=2276.154] IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND FIVE.
[ct=2279.960] WILLIAMS ALREADY WITH NINE
[ct=2281.178] CARRIES NOW.
[ct=2282.458] 28 YARDS.
[ct=2284.578] NOT ONLY IS IT RAINING NOW, IT’S
[ct=2289.449] GOTTEN A LOT CHILLIER.
[ct=2290.947] TEMPERATURE ABOUT 50
[ct=2292.063] DROPPING.
[ct=2292.943] >> Kirk: REMEMBER, THE RAMS DID
[ct=2295.413] NOT GIVE UP A SACK LAST WEEK
[ct=2297.903] AGAINST THAT TALENTED BILLS
[ct=2301.729] SEE HOW THEY DO HERE ON THIS
[ct=2304.808] THIRD DOWN ON THE EDGES.
[ct=2310.830] >> Al: BOSA TRYING TO GET TO
[ct=2311.128] HIM.
[ct=2313.779] AND HE HAS TO BACKHAND IT.
[ct=2315.023] BACKHAND FLIP.
[ct=2321.522] PRESSURE COMING FROM BEHIND HIM.
[ct=2326.751] YOU HAD GROSS-MATOS THE
[ct=2327.828] DEFENSIVE PLAYER INFAN
[ct=2328.567] DEFENSIVE PLAYER INNFC OF THE WE
[ct=2329.244] PUTTING THE PRESSURE ON.
[ct=2330.464] >> Kirk: THEY CAN MOVE HIM
[ct=2331.656] INSIDE LIKE THIS.
[ct=2334.813] IT KEEPS LEONARD FLOYD AND BOSA
[ct=2336.112] ON THE FIELD.
[ct=2337.998] HE BRINGS THAT KIND OF
[ct=2338.647] VERSATILITY AND CHASES STAFFORD
[ct=2339.897] OUSTED POCKET AND ALMOST COMES
[ct=2341.167] UP WITH A SACK AFTER THE THREE
[ct=2344.859] HE HAD A WEEK AGO.
[ct=2351.306] >> Al: EVANS.
[ct=2351.859] THE BALL BOUNCES AND WILL ROLL
[ct=2353.451] TO A STOP AT ABOUT THE 10.
[ct=2355.212] SECOND WEEK IN A ROW THE 49ers
[ct=2357.503] HAVE FORCED A PUNT ON THE FIRST
[ct=2360.053] FIVE DRIVES OF AN OPPONENT.
[ct=2360.307] CHICAGO LAST WEEK.
[ct=2362.551] CHRISTIAN McCAFFREY OF ALL THOSE
[ct=2365.758] BACKS IS A FIRST ROUND PICK.
[ct=2367.212] >> Al: DAVIS WAS A SIXTH
[ct=2368.042] ROUNDER.
[ct=2369.221] HOW MANY GUYS DO YOU GET IN THE
[ct=2370.103] SIXTH ROUND?
[ct=2370.842] TOM BRADY, MAYBE?
[ct=2374.616] RIGHT!
[ct=2375.562] NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
[ct=2376.765] >> Al: NO.
[ct=2378.956] ON FIRST DOWN, IT’S DROPPED.
[ct=2384.851] JAUAN JENNINGS, NORMALLY PRETTY
[ct=2386.149] SURE HANDED AND YOUNG COVERING
[ct=2386.860] ON THE PLAY.
[ct=2387.549] >> Kirk: THESE CONDITIONS ARE
[ct=2388.974] IMPACTING THE RECEIVERS IN THE
[ct=2390.292] PASSING GAME.
[ct=2391.313] BOTH COACHES TRYING TO MAKE
[ct=2393.753] ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PLAN THAT
[ct=2396.246] THEY HAD COMING IN.
[ct=2397.744] AND TRYING TO MAKE SOME TWEAKS.
[ct=2399.307] THIS IS REAL.
[ct=2403.928] THESE CONDITIONS ARE NOT LETTING
[ct=2403.928] UP.
[ct=2409.522] >> Al: STEADY RAIN.
[ct=2411.796] TELLING US IT’S GOING TO STOP IN
[ct=2412.811] A HALF-HOUR.
[ct=2413.801] WHO KNOWS.
[ct=2419.156] ON THE GROUND.
[ct=2421.569] TOUGH TWO YARDS FOR ISAAC
[ct=2424.397] GUERENDO WHO HAS CARRIED SEVEN
[ct=2426.427] TIMES BUT ONLY 18 YARDS.
[ct=2429.686] >> Kirk: GOOD JOB SETTING THE
[ct=2431.634] EDGE AND DEEBO SAMUEL, WE WERE
[ct=2433.301] JUST BRAGGING ABOUT THE RAMS
[ct=2434.891] RECEIVERS.
[ct=2435.466] DEEBO SAMUEL COMES OFF THE EDGE
[ct=2437.364] AND JUST KIND OF WHIFFS THERE
[ct=2439.192] AND TRYING TO MAKE A BLOCK ON
[ct=2439.413] KAM CURL.
[ct=2444.386] BOTH OF THESE TEAMS RELY ON THE
[ct=2445.841] PEMETER BLOCKING WHEN IT COMES
[ct=2449.806] TO RUNNING THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=2453.627] >> Al: THIRD DOWN.
[ct=2454.899] JUSZCZYK IN THE BACKFIELD AND
[ct=2455.229] ACCEPTED HIM OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=2456.460] PURDY THROWS.
[ct=2457.667] UP TO THE 22 YARD LINE.
[ct=2459.906] KITTLE HAULS IT IN TO CONVERT A
[ct=2462.544] COVERED BY WITHERSPOON.
[ct=2467.603] >> Kirk: JAKE BRENDEL DOES A
[ct=2469.301] HECK OF A JOB.
[ct=2470.870] LOOK AT THE OVERLOAD HERE.
[ct=2473.444] THE POTENTIAL THREAT AND HE JUST
[ct=2476.127] SENSES THAT POSSIBILITY AND
[ct=2477.281] COMES OVER LATE TO HELP OUT.
[ct=2479.417] THAT IS REALLY GOOD RECOGNITION
[ct=2481.195] THERE IN PASSING ON A THIRD DOWN
[ct=2482.717] AND, WHEN IN DOUBT, WET
[ct=2484.403] CONDITIONS, PUT IT UP TO NUMBER
[ct=2487.200] 85 IN ONE-ON-ONE COVERAGE AND
[ct=2489.648] KITTLE WILL COME DOWN WITH IT.
[ct=2490.470] >> Al: RAMS ALMOST JUMP OFFSIDE.
[ct=2496.835] THAT WAS JARED VERSE WHO GOT
[ct=2499.567] THAT TIME BYRON YOUNG TAKES
[ct=2501.279] GUERENDO DOWN IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=2505.502] GUERENDO NOW EIGHT CARRIES A
[ct=2505.878] 16 YARDS.
[ct=2506.965] >> Kirk: GREAT JOB.
[ct=2509.800] BOBBY BROWN 95 WINS.
[ct=2513.146] OMAR SPEIGHTS, THE LINEBACKER
[ct=2513.444] COMES INSIDE.
[ct=2516.125] THE ONLY PLACE HE CAN GO IS TRY
[ct=2517.717] TO BOUNCE A TEN WHEN HE BOUNCES
[ct=2519.315] IT, YOUNG GETS OFF THE BLOCK.
[ct=2520.489] VERSE GETS MOST OF THE
[ct=2521.798] ATTENTION, THE ROOKIE.
[ct=2523.019] THE SECOND-YEAR MAN OUT OF
[ct=2524.963] TENNESSEE IS RELENTLESS AND
[ct=2527.365] PLAYS REALLY GOOD WITH AWARENESS
[ct=2531.107] WITH HIS EYES IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=2531.407] >> Al: SECOND AND 11.
[ct=2532.419] DOWN THE SIDELINE.
[ct=2535.978] HE GOT FREE BUT THE PASS IS TOO
[ct=2539.746] LONG FOR JAUAN JENNINGS.
[ct=2543.068] THIRD AND 11.
[ct=2545.480] NO DOUBT, WEATHER IS A BIG
[ct=2546.418] FACTOR.
[ct=2548.035] >> Kirk: OH, YEAH.
[ct=2548.351] YEAH.
[ct=2549.394] >> Al: TRYING TO FIND THEIR MEN
[ct=2550.384] AND DROPPING A COUPLE OF PASSES
[ct=2551.561] HERE AND THERE.
[ct=2553.678] >> Kirk: CHRIS SHULA, THE
[ct=2555.981] DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR FROM THE
[ct=2558.055] RAMS, NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE HIS
[ct=2559.740] GUYS ON ISLANDS.
[ct=2562.886] THAT IS PART OF WHAT YOU HAVE TO
[ct=2564.158] DO AGAINST THIS SAN FRANCISCO
[ct=2566.801] YOU GOT TO TAKE SOME CHANCES AND
[ct=2568.613] TO DO THAT YOUR CORNERBACKS AND
[ct=2569.574] LINEBACKERS AND SAFETIES HAVE
[ct=2569.952] GOT TO HOLD UP.
[ct=2572.566] >> Al: PURDY ESCAPES.
[ct=2572.772] NOT FOR FAR.
[ct=2577.676] NOT FOR LONG.
[ct=2579.924] KOBIE TURNER IS THERE.
[ct=2581.154] HE MIGHT HAVE PICKED UP A FIRST
[ct=2583.359] HE HAD ENOUGH SPACE BUT TURNER
[ct=2585.963] GETS HIM FROM BEHIND TO FORCE A
[ct=2587.302] >> Kirk: WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT
[ct=2588.404] HIM AND WHAT HE FACES.
[ct=2590.374] NOT JUST FROM THE "MASKED
[ct=2592.352] SINGER" BUT THE GUY CAN PLAY
[ct=2594.997] HE IS A GUY THAT WALKED ON AT
[ct=2595.952] RICHMOND AND THEN HE GOES TO
[ct=2597.963] WAKE FOREST AND, YOU KNOW, A GUY
[ct=2599.512] THAT THEY REALLY THOUGHT COULD
[ct=2601.002] BECOME A GREAT PLAYER AND HAS
[ct=2602.734] BECOME KIND OF A LEADER OF THAT
[ct=2603.693] FRONT.
[ct=2605.117] GOOD JOB OF BEING -- PLAYING
[ct=2606.497] WITH A HIGH MOTOR THERE AND NOT
[ct=2607.984] GIVE UP ON IT.
[ct=2608.573] >> Al: HERE COMES O’DONNELL’S
[ct=2610.276] FIFTH PUNT OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=2614.100] LINE DRIVE SPINNER AT THE 36
[ct=2615.607] YARD LINE AND XAVIER SMITH --
[ct=2616.395] FLAG IS DOWN.
[ct=2620.943] FLAG DOWN AT THE 14 YARD LINE
[ct=2622.936] AND NEAR THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=2625.086] RELATIVE PENALTY-FREE GAME.
[ct=2627.015] ONLY ONE ACCEPTED FOR EACH TEAM.
[ct=2630.550] CLAY MARTIN WILL TELL US ABOUT
[ct=2636.755] THIS ONE.
[ct=2638.278] RAMS/49ers.
[ct=2640.561] I THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE A
[ct=2642.185] SHOOT-OUT AND IT’S TURNED OUT TO
[ct=2645.797] BE A PUNT-ATHON.
[ct=2647.876] GO FIGURE.
[ct=2649.804] WHO KNEW?
[ct=2651.471] >> Referee: ILLEGAL FORMATION ON
[ct=2652.299] SAN FRANCISCO.
[ct=2653.234] THEY HAD FIVE PLAYERS IN THE
[ct=2655.455] THE RAMS WILL ENFORCE THE
[ct=2656.712] FIVE-YARD PENALTY AT THE END OF
[ct=2659.501] IT’S FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2659.897] TIME-OUT.
[ct=2661.562] >> Kirk: STAFFORD HAS GOT GREAT
[ct=2662.621] FIELD POSITIOO GO.
[ct=2663.539] >> Al: ABSOLUTELY.
[ct=2666.633] SPEND AN SPENTIRE WEEK AND
[ct=2667.777] WHEREVER WE ARE.
[ct=2669.838] THE RAMS BEGIN THIS DRIVE AND
[ct=2670.884] DOWN 3-0.
[ct=2671.181] THEY START ON THE GROUND.
[ct=2675.584] NEITHER TEAM DOING ANYTHING ON
[ct=2676.426] THE GROUND TONIGHT.
[ct=2680.060] THAT IS KYREN WILLIAMS TAKEN DOW
[ct=2680.701] JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE THERE.
[ct=2682.660] >> Kirk: THE 49ers DEFENSE KNEW
[ct=2684.844] AGAINST SEAN McVAY.
[ct=2687.061] WE TALKED ABOUT HOW IT STARTS
[ct=2687.773] WITH THEIR ABILITY TO RUN.
[ct=2689.460] LOOK AT THIS.
[ct=2690.990] THEY HAVE HAD FIVE POSSESSIONS.
[ct=2691.708] FINALLY PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER
[ct=2693.381] ON THE LAST DRIVE WHERE THEY
[ct=2695.191] STARTED AT THEIR OWN 3, BUT THEY
[ct=2696.293] CAME IN KNOWING THEY HAD TO STOP
[ct=2700.987] THE RUN AND FIRST AND TEN, BOY,
[ct=2700.987] THOSE LINEBACKERS ARE FLYING
[ct=2702.895] DOWNHILL AND BOTH GREENLAW AND
[ct=2709.616] >> Al: FIRST TIME THE RAMS HAVE
[ct=2710.817] BEEN AS FAR AS THE 50 YARD LINE
[ct=2717.757] AGAIN, WILLIAMS.
[ct=2718.000] LOOK AT HIM GO.
[ct=2718.409] LOOK AT HIM GO!
[ct=2718.859] WOW!
[ct=2725.232] YARDS AFTER CONTACT.
[ct=2726.355] >> Kirk: HE WOULD NOT STOP.
[ct=2727.542] I THINK IT LOOKED LIKE A
[ct=2728.548] TWO-YARD GAIN.
[ct=2729.713] HE JUST WOULDN’T STOP.
[ct=2732.263] THE OFFENSIVE LINEMEN GOT BEHIND
[ct=2734.093] HIM AND THEY KEPT PUSHING.
[ct=2736.258] JACKSON GETS IN THERE, THE LEFT
[ct=2738.495] LOOK AT HIS LEG DRIVE.
[ct=2739.405] LOOK AT THAT LEG DRIVE!
[ct=2739.856] TALK ABOUT DETERMINATION!
[ct=2743.633] AND THE LINEMEN FEED OFF OF
[ct=2746.941] THE WHOLE TEAM DOES.
[ct=2748.210] >> Al: HE GOT FIVE ON A
[ct=2748.631] PUSH/PUSH.
[ct=2750.631] THIRD AND ONE.
[ct=2757.569] KUPP IN MOTION.
[ct=2760.811] WILLIAMS HAS ENOUGH.
[ct=2764.423] 3:22 UNTIL THE HALF.
[ct=2766.301] >> Kaylee: IF THIS RAIN KEEPS
[ct=2768.158] COMING DOWN HARDER AND HARDER,
[ct=2769.349] THE RAMS SIDELINE IS MAKING
[ct=2771.183] PREPARATIONS, IF NEEDED.
[ct=2772.080] ONE STAFFER FILLING EQUIPMENT
[ct=2774.992] CASE OVER HERE WITH EXTRA PAIRS
[ct=2776.356] OF CLEATS IN CASE OF PLAYERS
[ct=2777.913] SHOULD ASK FOR A BIGGER SPIKES
[ct=2781.732] IF THEY NEED MORE TRACTION.
[ct=2784.986] UNDERNEATH ONE TARP IS TACK
[ct=2788.693] STACK OF DRY GLOVES AND THEY ARE
[ct=2792.806] BRINGING OFF THE MATTES AS GUYS
[ct=2794.692] ARE CLEANING OFF THE CLEATS AS
[ct=2796.451] THEY GET MUDDY.
[ct=2798.181] >> Al: YOU WILL HAVE A WARDROBE
[ct=2799.378] CHANGE AT THE HALF?
[ct=2800.868] >> Kaylee: I WISH.
[ct=2802.252] >> Al: 38 YARD LINE.
[ct=2804.978] WILLIAMS PICKS UP THREE A WORK
[ct=2804.978] HORSE TONIGHT.
[ct=2806.765] HE HAD 29 CARRIES LAST WEEK.
[ct=2808.141] HE HAS 13 TONIGHT.
[ct=2813.790] >> Kirk: 42 AS AN OFFENSE, THEY
[ct=2815.676] KNOW THAT THEY HAVE GOT TO,
[ct=2817.183] AGAIN, ESTABLISH THAT.
[ct=2820.089] WHAT I THINK IT SETS UP -- NOW
[ct=2821.032] THE WEATHER CONDITIONS MAY GET
[ct=2822.235] TOUGH, BUT IT DEFINITELY ALLOWS
[ct=2824.176] YOU TO SET UP THE PLAY ACTION ON
[ct=2825.781] EARLY DOWNS AND TAKE SOME SHOTS
[ct=2827.812] WITH THE WAY THESE SAFETIES AND
[ct=2829.096] BACKERS ARE GETTING DOWNHILL
[ct=2831.799] AGAINST THE RUN.
[ct=2840.259] WILL THEY RUN A PLAY BEFORE THE
[ct=2840.969] TWO-MINUTE WARNING?
[ct=2840.969] THEY DO.
[ct=2851.113] IT’S NICK BOSA RIGHT THERE TO
[ct=2852.164] STOP WILLIAMS AND TAKES US TO
[ct=2854.901] THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING WITH 1:56
[ct=2861.955] REMAINING IN THE HALF. BY PLAYIN
[ct=2867.171] HE IS 43.
[ct=2871.128] >> Kirk: HE IS 43 PLAYING 33.
[ct=2871.356] >> Al: RIGHT.
[ct=2872.244] QUICK FLIP OUT HERE.
[ct=2873.971] NACUA.
[ct=2877.208] WARNER IS RIGHT THERE TO STUFF
[ct=2880.640] SO NOW IT’S FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=2889.235] SO THE FIELD GOAL KICKER IS JOSH
[ct=2890.670] KARTY.
[ct=2893.841] YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT A 48-YARD
[ct=2894.499] LINE FIELD GOAL.
[ct=2895.436] AT THE MOMENT, THEY ARE KEEPING
[ct=2896.198] THE OFFENSE OUT THERE.
[ct=2897.809] AT THE ENDS OF THE BUFFALO GAME
[ct=2900.089] LAST WEEK, THEY MADE A MONSTER
[ct=2902.319] FOURTH AND FIVE ON A PASS TO
[ct=2903.855] TUTU ATWELL.
[ct=2904.672] HERE THEY LINE UP TO GO FOR IT
[ct=2908.078] ON FOURTH AND TWO.
[ct=2913.992] PLAY CLOCK AT 5.
[ct=2915.892] THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO DRAW
[ct=2917.687] THEM OFFSIDE.
[ct=2925.544] THEY WILL BRING KARTI IN HERE.
[ct=2927.086] THEY SCORED 44 LAST WEEK.
[ct=2928.763] THE OTHER TEAM ROUTING CHICAGO.
[ct=2930.383] TOUCHDOWNS GALORE.
[ct=2932.342] 3-0 TONIGHT.
[ct=2933.849] THE WEATHER, OBVIOUSLY, HAS A
[ct=2935.069] LOT TO DO WITH IT EVEN THOUGH
[ct=2936.586] IT’S ABATING RIGHT NOW.
[ct=2937.487] >> Kirk: YOU’RE ON CUE WITH THE
[ct=2937.805] RAIN.
[ct=2939.252] YOU HAD IT DOWN.
[ct=2941.350] YOU SAID IT WAS GOING TO STOP IN
[ct=2941.640] 30 MINUTES.
[ct=2941.992] IT STOPPED.
[ct=2944.185] BUT THEY SAID 40% OF CHANCE AND
[ct=2945.864] IT’S BEEN RAINING THE ENTIRE
[ct=2946.297] FIRST HALF.
[ct=2947.514] HOPEFULLY IT WILL DRY OUT A
[ct=2948.951] LITTLE BIT AND WE WILL GET MORE
[ct=2951.888] OFFENSE GOING IN THE SECOND
[ct=2951.888] HALF.
[ct=2954.621] >> Al: THEY DON’T CALL ME
[ct=2956.017] DOPPLER DOCTOR FOR NOTHING.
[ct=2958.278] >> Kirk: YOU’RE ALL OVER IT.
[ct=2960.533] >> Al: KARTY IS A ROOKIE OUT OF
[ct=2964.939] STANFORD AND PLAYED HIS COLLEGE
[ct=2964.939] BALL RIGHT UP THE ROAD.
[ct=2968.302] THIS TO TIE THE GAME.
[ct=2973.003] AND KARTY’S KICK IS RIGHT DOWN
[ct=2976.397] THE 101.
[ct=2979.923] 65 SECONDS UNTIL HALFTIME.
[ct=2980.541] 3-3 ON "THURSDAY NIGHT
[ct=2980.886] FOOTBALL."
[ct=2992.660] >> Al: THE FIELD GOAL WAS GOOD
[ct=2995.307] BUT LOOK AT THIS.
[ct=2997.404] BIG LEFT HAND OF JORDAN ELLIOTT
[ct=3000.405] WHO IS 6’5" AND IT STILL WENT
[ct=3001.435] DOWN THE MIDDLE.
[ct=3002.565] >> Kirk: JUST OFF THE TOP OF
[ct=3002.822] THAT FINGERTIP.
[ct=3006.211] BUT HE REALLY DROVE THAT BALL.
[ct=3006.611] GOOD SNAP.
[ct=3007.070] GOOD HOLD.
[ct=3008.659] LOOK AT THAT.
[ct=3009.790] BALL NOT AFFECTED AT ALL BY THAT
[ct=3009.790] FINGERTIP.
[ct=3015.684] >> Al: SHOULDN’T HAVE GOTTEN A
[ct=3019.318] MANICURE.
[ct=3022.698] 49ers WILL TAKE IT AT THE 30
[ct=3024.820] UPDATE THE PLAYOFF PICTURE AS WE
[ct=3027.304] START WEEK NUMBER 15.
[ct=3029.298] YOU GOT DETROIT CLENCHING 9
[ct=3030.654] BIRTH AND PHILLY AS WELL AND
[ct=3033.083] SEATTLE LEADS THE WEST AND TAMPA
[ct=3033.954] BAY 7-6.
[ct=3035.308] VIKINGS AND GREEN BAY AND
[ct=3036.443] WASHINGTON, AT THE MOMENT, WOULD
[ct=3040.713] BE THE WILDCARD TEAMS.
[ct=3044.183] OF COURSE, THE DIVISION WINNERS
[ct=3044.885] OR DIVISION LEADERS WILL WIND UP
[ct=3048.226] GETTING A WILDCARD GAME AT HOME.
[ct=3048.952] TRENT WILLIAMS, OF COURSE, THEY
[ct=3049.434] MISS HIM.
[ct=3049.709] THE LEFT TACKLE.
[ct=3052.039] THERE HE IS MISSING HIS FOURTH
[ct=3054.182] TEN DAYS OFF BEFORE THEIR NEXT
[ct=3057.785] MIGHT GET HIM BACK.
[ct=3058.805] THEIR NEXT GAME WILL BE A WEEK
[ct=3059.756] FROM SUNDAY.
[ct=3063.203] DEEBO SAMUEL HERE PICKS UP ABOUT
[ct=3063.776] SIX.
[ct=3069.158] NEXT GAME IS AT MIAMI.
[ct=3070.170] >> Kirk: PURDY JUST OVER 100
[ct=3073.950] YARDS HERE IN THIS FIRST HALF.
[ct=3075.739] KYLE SHANAHAN WITH THREE
[ct=3079.529] TIME-OUTS IS THINKING AT LEAST
[ct=3081.007] GETTING IN FIELD GOAL RANGE
[ct=3083.572] EW.
[ct=3083.773] >> Al: PASS OVER THE MIDDLE IS
[ct=3084.881] INCOMPLETE AND TRYING TO GET IT
[ct=3087.300] TO RICKY PEARSALL, FIRST TIME HE
[ct=3089.519] HAS BEEN TARGETED TONIGHT.
[ct=3091.699] TRENTON LAKE WITH THE COVERAGE.
[ct=3093.352] RAMS WILL GET THE BALL TO START
[ct=3096.007] THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=3105.696] SEAN MAY BE THE FIRST COACH I’VE
[ct=3107.923] EVER SEEN IN RAIN LIKE THIS NOT
[ct=3109.970] TO WEAR A HAT.
[ct=3111.148] >> Kirk: BILL BELICHICK, WHO WAS
[ct=3111.412] IN THE NEWS TODAY.
[ct=3113.795] >> Al: YOU THINK?
[ct=3117.717] >> Kirk: THAT WAS A SHOCKER.
[ct=3118.223] >> Al: THIRD DOWN AND FOUR.
[ct=3124.704] PURDY FIRING.
[ct=3125.333] BROKEN UP.
[ct=3131.954] TRIED TO GET IT TO JENNINGS.
[ct=3133.055] LAKE IN ON THE PLAY.
[ct=3136.427] FOURTH AND FOUR.
[ct=3138.626] >> Kirk: REALLY GOOD JOB HERE OF
[ct=3140.551] COMMUNICATION WITH THE DEFENSIVE
[ct=3140.894] BACKS.
[ct=3142.276] DIDN’T SEE IT BUT A LITTLE
[ct=3143.557] SWITCH THERE WITH THE MOTION.
[ct=3146.166] GOOD JOB BACK-TO-BACK PLAYS BY
[ct=3146.470] LAKE.
[ct=3147.797] REALLY, I TELL YOU FOR A GUY
[ct=3148.890] THAT IS A SAFETY, SOMETIMES HE
[ct=3152.107] IS A CORNER, SOMETIMES HE IS AT
[ct=3154.461] NICKEL, HE DOES A GOOD JOB.
[ct=3155.990] A DIFFERENT AREA, THAT TIME HAD
[ct=3157.827] PLAY DOWN THE FIELD.
[ct=3158.822] GOOD JOB.
[ct=3162.021] >> Al: PRETTY GOOD BLOOD LINES.
[ct=3163.005] HIS FATHER CARNELL, A GREAT
[ct=3163.438] SAFETY BACK IN THE PITTSBURGH
[ct=3163.780] DAYS.
[ct=3166.314] XAVIER SMITH MAKES THE FAIR
[ct=3168.687] 50 DEGREES.
[ct=3172.245] RAINING OFF AND ON.
[ct=3173.769] RIGHT NOW, NOT MUCH.
[ct=3173.936] PRETTY GOOD.
[ct=3176.491] THE BEST IT’S BEEN IN 45 MINUTES
[ct=3177.008] OR SO.
[ct=3180.944] THE RAMS NOW HAVE TWO TIME-OUTS.
[ct=3182.203] 29 SECONDS.
[ct=3184.290] THEY TRY TO WORK IN TO FIELD
[ct=3186.381] GOAL RANGE.
[ct=3188.963] START HERE NACUA.
[ct=3190.269] PUKA WORKS HIS WAY UP TO THE 31.
[ct=3193.820] GREENLAW IS IN ON THAT TACKLE.
[ct=3194.989] THEY ARE LETTING THE CLOCK RUN
[ct=3196.646] DOWN HERE.
[ct=3197.309] >> Kirk: I THINK ON THAT LAST
[ct=3200.688] POSSESSION, TO GET THIS THING
[ct=3201.978] TIED UP, AS SLOPPY AS THIS FIRST
[ct=3203.103] HALF HAS BEEN, KIND OF REGROUP
[ct=3204.922] AND SEE WHERE THINGS GO IN THE
[ct=3205.718] SECOND HALF FOR
[ct=3207.925] COACHES.
[ct=3209.043] >> Al: DRY OFF AND MAYBE CHANGE
[ct=3209.379] THEIR SHOES.
[ct=3211.823] WE WILL SEE.
[ct=3212.523] IT IS THE END OF KIND OF A
[ct=3214.987] BIZARRE FIRST HALF, ININERS
[ct=3217.669] ARE DOING A GOOD JOB OF JUMPING
[ct=3218.855] THESE UNDERNEATH ROUTES.
[ct=3221.192] OFF OF PLAY ACTION, I WOULDN’T
[ct=3222.406] BE SURPRISED TO SEE HEM TAKE A
[ct=3223.610] SHOT OR TWO EARLY HERE IN THE
[ct=3226.032] SECOND HALF TO TRY TO STRETCH
[ct=3228.352] THAT 49ers DEFENSE OUT.
[ct=3230.901] >> Al: THE RAMS WILL GET THE
[ct=3231.226] BALL.
[ct=3232.506] NACUA COMING OFF AN UNBELIEVABLE
[ct=3234.572] GAME AGAINST BUFFALO, ONE CATCH,
[ct=3235.717] EIGHT YARDS.
[ct=3238.981] KUPP, NO CATCHES.
[ct=3239.900] THIRD QUARTER IS UNDER WAY.
[ct=3242.767] IT’S A RETURNABLE KICK FROM THE
[ct=3245.843] 5 YARD LINE.
[ct=3248.625] JORDAN WHITTINGTON.
[ct=3249.867] GOOD COVERAGE HERE AND TAKE HIM
[ct=3253.306] DOWN TO THE 24.
[ct=3254.850] >> Kaylee: SEAN, YOU GET THE
[ct=3256.059] BALL AND HOPEFULLY THIS WEATHER
[ct=3256.448] HOLDS.
[ct=3257.845] HOW DO YOU GET YOUR PASSING GAME
[ct=3258.508] GOING?
[ct=3261.361] >> THE WEATHER A LITTLE BIT OF A
[ct=3264.179] THE BALL HAS BEEN SLICK.
[ct=3266.042] WE HAVEN’T GOTTEN MUCH GOING IN
[ct=3267.060] THE PASS GAME AND NOT STAY
[ct=3268.818] CONNECTED IN THE RUN GAME BUT A
[ct=3272.940] GREAT JOB BY JOSH KARTY TO KICK
[ct=3273.459] THE PHILADELPHIA.
[ct=3275.788] SEE IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING IN
[ct=3276.420] THE HALF.
[ct=3277.191] >> Kaylee: YOU HELD THE NINERS
[ct=3277.729] TO A FIELD GOAL.
[ct=3280.004] HOW DO YOU SUSTAIN THAT?
[ct=3281.418] >> GUYS ARE EFFICIENT EARLY ON
[ct=3281.836] THE DOWNS.
[ct=3282.634] I THINK THE WEATHER HAS BEEN A
[ct=3285.704] WE GOT TO GET STUFF GOING
[ct=3286.593] OFFENSIVELY AND SUSTAIN
[ct=3288.996] POSSESSION AND COME AWAY WITH
[ct=3289.812] POINTS.
[ct=3290.616] >> Al: THEY START ON THE GROUND.
[ct=3293.386] NACUA THREE CATCHES ON THE
[ct=3295.766] CORRECTION.
[ct=3296.005] KUPP WITH NONE.
[ct=3297.450] WILLIAMS IS THE WORK HORSE FOR
[ct=3298.431] LOS ANGELES ON THE GROUND.
[ct=3300.151] 15 CARRIES FOR 47 YARDS AND
[ct=3302.867] AVERAGING ABOUT 3 PER CARRY.
[ct=3303.531] IT’S AMAZING.
[ct=3304.136] YOU KNOW?
[ct=3305.465] YOU LOOK AT HIS BODY.
[ct=3306.863] THIS GUY IS A WORK HORSE.
[ct=3310.092] HE ACCOUNTS FOR 74% OF THE RAMS
[ct=3310.882] CARRIES THIS YEAR.
[ct=3313.125] THAT IS THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE
[ct=3315.013] OF ANY BACK IN THE NFL.
[ct=3316.900] YOU SEE IF THEY CAN GET HIM ON
[ct=3317.783] TRACK AGAIN.
[ct=3319.523] I THINK THE COMBINATION OF HIM
[ct=3321.985] AND THEN TAKING SOME SHOTS DOWN
[ct=3325.246] I DON’T MEAN JUST GO BALLS BUT
[ct=3327.002] THE DEEP CROSSERS AT 15, 20
[ct=3327.400] YARDS, TOO.
[ct=3329.236] HERE HE IS AGAIN.
[ct=3334.792] OVER THE 1,000 YARD MARK LAST
[ct=3335.445] WEEK FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A
[ct=3338.646] >> Kirk: IF YOU’RE JUST TUNING
[ct=3341.253] IN AND YOU GOT TWO OF THE BETTER
[ct=3342.594] RECEIVERS AND STAFFORD.
[ct=3346.663] THEY COME IN ON FIRE.
[ct=3348.643] UNDERNEATH ROUTES HAVE BEEN
[ct=3349.012] TAKEN AWAY.
[ct=3350.710] TIGHT COVERAGE.
[ct=3351.420] STAFFORD LOOKING AWAY AND
[ct=3353.350] WORKING THROUGH HIS PROGRESSES
[ct=3355.380] AND EVENTUALLY COMING BACK.
[ct=3356.922] LINEBACKERS WITH GREAT
[ct=3360.513] COMMUNICATION WITH THE SAFETIES.
[ct=3361.468] WARD PLAYING THE BEST GAME WE
[ct=3362.777] HAVE SEEN HIM PLAY SINCE COMING
[ct=3365.422] BACK THE LAST THREE WEEKS.
[ct=3366.454] THE FIRST HALF YOU CHALK IT UP
[ct=3367.943] TO THE NINERS DEFENSE AND THEIR
[ct=3370.909] PREPARATION.
[ct=3371.753] >> Al: THIRD AND FIVE.
[ct=3376.765] SECONDARY CONTINUES TO DO ITS
[ct=3378.551] JOB AND JUST HAS TO FLIP IT INTO
[ct=3379.242] THE BENCH.
[ct=3381.155] YOU GOT ENOUGH PRESSURE ON HIM
[ct=3383.128] AND IT’S OUT OF THE POCKET BUT
[ct=3386.884] THAT SECONDARY, LIKE GLUE.
[ct=3387.511] >> Kirk: THAT JUST RUSHING FOUR
[ct=3388.634] AND WHAT THEY DID IN THE FIR
[ct=3390.212] IT’S NOT A BLITZ.
[ct=3392.413] YOU GOT SOME GREAT PASS RUSHERS.
[ct=3394.364] ONCE HE GETS OUT, YOU’RE PLAYING
[ct=3395.174] ZONE.
[ct=3397.575] IT’S JUST GREAT AWARENESS OF
[ct=3398.462] LOOKING AROUND.
[ct=3399.341] THAT IS PLASTER.
[ct=3401.824] YOU ALWAYS SEE DEFENSIVE COACHES
[ct=3404.053] SAY WE GOT TO PLASTER IF THE
[ct=3404.756] QUARTERBACK MOVES AROUND.
[ct=3407.609] THERE IS JUST NOWHERE TO GO FOR
[ct=3411.254] STAFFORD WHEN HE IS THROWING THE
[ct=3413.542] >> Al: EVANS IS AVERAGING 66
[ct=3415.024] YARDS A PUNT.
[ct=3416.139] ANOTHER LINE DRIVE TAKEN TO THE
[ct=3417.447] 7 YARD LINE BY JACOB COWING.
[ct=3421.729] SO THE RAMS QUICKLY DONE AFTER
[ct=3423.308] THAT FIRST DRIVE.
[ct=3425.645] 46-YARD PUNT BY EVANS.
[ct=3428.442] SAN FRANCISCO WILL START THIS
[ct=3431.544] DRIVE FROM ITS OWN 37.
[ct=3432.286] >> Kirk: I DO THINK THAT THE
[ct=3434.267] NINERS ARE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT
[ct=3434.617] UNIT.
[ct=3440.646] THEY HAVE HAD SO MANY INJURIES.
[ct=3446.404] BUT DRE GREEN SHORTSTOP LAW
[ct=3447.427] BUT DRE GREEN SHORTLAW AND COMIN
[ct=3456.652] AND HUE FFANGA.
[ct=3457.396] >> Al: MAYBE WE WILL SEE
[ct=3459.288] JUSZCZYK MORE HERE ON THE GROUND
[ct=3462.014] GUERENDO PICKS UP EIGHT YARDS
[ct=3464.900] >> Kirk: NICE COMBINATION WITH
[ct=3467.207] BRENDEL AND BANKS 64 AND 65,
[ct=3469.543] CENTER AND LEFT GUARD, ESTABLISH
[ct=3471.569] THEY GET UP TO THE LINEBACKERS.
[ct=3472.777] JUSZCZYK GETS A NICE BLOCK.
[ct=3475.752] THAT IS FRAN 49ers OFFENSE RIGHT
[ct=3478.851] THERE, NO MATTER WHO THE RUNNING
[ct=3479.151] BACK IS.
[ct=3481.444] >> Al: JUSZCZYK IS IN MOTION AND
[ct=3482.913] SETS ON THE RIGHT.
[ct=3484.565] GUERENDO ON THE GROUND AND HE
[ct=3486.905] GETS TO THE 50 YARD LINE AND A
[ct=3487.945] FIRST DOWN FOR THE 49ers.
[ct=3489.203] >> Kirk: I THINK EVERYBODY OVER
[ct=3491.858] THE YEARS HAS MARVELLED AT THE
[ct=3494.052] SHANAHAN COACHES, YOU KNOW, MIKE
[ct=3495.477] AND KYLE AND THE BACKS THAT THEY
[ct=3496.519] HAVE HAD, YOU KNOW?
[ct=3498.284] VERY RARELY ARE THEY GETTING A
[ct=3499.790] GUY THAT IS THE GUY LIKE A
[ct=3501.279] CHRISTIAN McCAFFREY WHO THEY GOT
[ct=3503.184] THROUGH A TRADE WITH CAROLINA.
[ct=3505.402] YOU KNOW, IT’S GO THROUGH THE
[ct=3507.388] ALL THE WAY BACK TO TERRELL
[ct=3508.593] DAVIS AT DENVER.
[ct=3511.327] IT’S GUY THAT FITS THEIR SYSTEM.
[ct=3511.846] A GUY THAT HAS GOOD VISION.
[ct=3514.456] HE IS TOUGH.
[ct=3515.495] HE GETS INTO THE HOLE AND IS
[ct=3517.585] ABLE TO JUST FIT WITH WHAT THEY
[ct=3522.925] LIKE TO DO IN THIS OFFENSE.
[ct=3523.945] >> Al: STRAIGHT DROP.
[ct=3525.805] PASS OUT TO GUERENDO ON THE
[ct=3526.456] OUTSIDE.
[ct=3530.253] AND HE HAS A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3531.440] DARIOUS WILLIAMS MAKES THE
[ct=3533.019] 49ers ON THE MOVE.
[ct=3534.445] >> Kirk: THAT IS WHERE HE IS
[ct=3536.377] MOST NATURAL JUST GOING BACK TO
[ct=3538.018] HIS DAYS OF A HIGH SCHOOL WIDE
[ct=3539.546] RECEIVER BEFORE HE MOVED WHEN HE
[ct=3542.725] WENT TO WISCONSIN TO RUNNING
[ct=3543.978] HE MADE A GREAT CATCH LAST WEEK
[ct=3546.169] AGAINST THE BEARS WHERE HE
[ct=3547.549] ADJUSTED BACK TO THE FOOTBALL TO
[ct=3549.133] GIVE YOU AN IDEA WHAT HE CAN DO
[ct=3550.878] WITH HIS HANDS, SO VERY NATURAL
[ct=3551.970] CATCHING THE FOOTBALL AND I
[ct=3553.180] THINK HE JUST KEEPS GETTING
[ct=3555.002] BETTER AND BETTER WITH HIS FEEL
[ct=3557.254] OF HITTING THESE HOLES AND
[ct=3560.296] UNDERSTANDING, LIKE WE TALKED
[ct=3561.358] EARLIER IN THE SCHEME OF THE
[ct=3564.774] TIMING OF THE ZONE PLAY.
[ct=3570.177] >> Al: BACK IN TO SHOTGUN ON A
[ct=3572.687] DANCING.
[ct=3577.798] DEEBO SAMUEL WAS THE INTENDED
[ct=3578.515] RECEIVER.
[ct=3581.897] >> Kirk: I THINK BROCK PURDY
[ct=3584.308] WANTS TO GET THE BALL TO HIS
[ct=3587.395] GUYS SO BADLY THAT SOMETIMES
[ct=3588.926] WHEN YOU WANT IT SO BAD,
[ct=3590.123] SOMETIMES YOU START TO JUST AIM
[ct=3590.879] THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=3593.334] I MEAN, HE IS SUCH AN ACCURATE
[ct=3593.707] QUARTERBACK.
[ct=3594.857] THIS IS AN EASY THROW.
[ct=3597.609] THE BALL JUST KIND OF SAILED ON
[ct=3598.433] I MEAN, HE HAD TO ANSWER
[ct=3599.868] QUESTIONS THIS WEEK ABOUT, HEY,
[ct=3602.221] DID YOU HEAR WHAT DEEBO SAMUEL
[ct=3602.452] TWEETED
[ct=3605.010] CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?
[ct=3605.961] HE HAD ANSWER THAT A COUPLE
[ct=3607.383] TIMES.
[ct=3607.742] GUYS, LISTEN.
[ct=3608.539] NOBODY WANTS TO GIVE HIM THE
[ct=3609.934] BALL MORE THAN ME AND WE WILL
[ct=3611.572] CONTINUE TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO
[ct=3612.381] DO THAT.
[ct=3614.238] >> Al: SECOND AND TEN.
[ct=3614.444] FIRES.
[ct=3617.050] CAUGHT.
[ct=3618.952] AND NINE-YARD GAIN HERE FOR
[ct=3621.820] TAKEN DOWN BY HOYT.
[ct=3624.608] THIRD AND ONE UPCOMING.
[ct=3625.137] >> Kirk: THIS OFFENSE, LIKE SO
[ct=3627.775] MANY, ARE BASED ON THE TIMING
[ct=3629.864] AND THE RHYTHM IN THE PASS GAME.
[ct=3632.426] HERE HE JUST GETS BACK, A HITCH.
[ct=3634.088] BALL OUT.
[ct=3635.648] PERFECTLY THROWN.
[ct=3638.224] THERE WAS NO HESITATION.
[ct=3638.881] FOUND HIS MAN.
[ct=3640.572] KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE ANSWER WAS
[ct=3642.580] BASED ON THE COVERAGE, SAW
[ct=3644.454] HOECHT WHO IS REALLY A BETTER
[ct=3646.228] PASS RUSHER THAN HE IS PLAYING
[ct=3647.049] OUT IN COVERAGE.
[ct=3648.900] GOOD JOB OF RECOGNIZING THAT
[ct=3650.216] PRESNAP AND GETTING THE BALL OUT
[ct=3652.678] THERE QUICKLY.
[ct=3655.899] >> Al: KITTLE HAS NOW CAUGHT
[ct=3656.591] THREE.
[ct=3661.991] PURDY, HIMSELF, PICKS UP THE
[ct=3664.402] >> Kirk: I LOVE THAT BECAUSE HE
[ct=3666.540] JUST DIDN’T HESITATE.
[ct=3668.949] HE SAW A GAP OVER THE RIGHT SIDE
[ct=3670.586] OF THE CENTER AND HE DIDN’T TRY
[ct=3672.519] TO BAIT HIM OR TRY TO GET HIM TO
[ct=3673.287] JUMP.
[ct=3675.366] HE JUST SAW IT AND JUST TOOK
[ct=3676.084] OFF.
[ct=3679.572] HE IS A VERY ATHLETIC GUY.
[ct=3681.567] YOU AND I STANDING ON THE FIELD
[ct=3683.694] TALKING WITH HIM WITH KAYLEE
[ct=3684.140] BEFORE THE GAME.
[ct=3684.700] HE IS THICK.
[ct=3687.748] HIS LEGS AND HIS LOWER HALF AND
[ct=3689.456] HIS CORE ARE VERY THICK.
[ct=3690.350] >> Al: BETTER RUNNER THAN HE
[ct=3694.549] GETS CREDIT
[ct=3696.257] >> Kirk: YES.
[ct=3696.795] >> Al: HE HAD GREAT RUNS IN THE
[ct=3697.446] PLAYOFFS LAST YEAR.
[ct=3700.935] GUERENDO MADE THAT GRAB.
[ct=3703.885] >> Kirk: DISTINCT WHEN IT POWELL
[ct=3704.068] IT DOWN AND GO.
[ct=3707.526] ANOTHER NICE CATCH THERE BY
[ct=3710.682] A GOOD SHOT OF STAFFORD AND
[ct=3711.321] COOPER KUPP.
[ct=3712.808] THERE WILL BE NO PANIC IN THOSE
[ct=3713.446] VETERANS.
[ct=3715.733] THEY GOT TO FIND SOME ANSWERS
[ct=3718.534] AND, EVENTUALLY, JUST GOT TO GET
[ct=3719.154] THE FOOTBALL BACK AND SEE IF
[ct=3721.714] THEY CAN GET THIS OFFENSE GOING.
[ct=3724.867] I THOUGHT SEAN WAS RIGHT.
[ct=3727.053] LIKE INSTEAD OF WHAT IS WRONG
[ct=3728.706] WITH THE RAMS, IT’S NINERS ARE
[ct=3730.460] PLAYING PRETTY GOOD DEFENSE.
[ct=3732.404] SECOND DOWN AND EIGHT.
[ct=3733.820] TOSS BACK HERE.
[ct=3736.101] GUERENDO TRIES TO CUT IT BACK
[ct=3738.171] AND TAKEN DOWN.
[ct=3744.124] THERE IS HOECHT AGAIN.
[ct=3745.371] SPEIGHTS IS ALSO THERE.
[ct=3746.821] THE RUNNING GAME, HELPS TO HAVE
[ct=3748.566] A GREAT OFFENSIVE LINE COACH AS
[ct=3748.909] WELL.
[ct=3749.822] >> Kirk: YEAH, YOU’RE RIGHT
[ct=3750.119] ABOUT THAT.
[ct=3752.166] REAL QUICK HERE ON HOECHT.
[ct=3753.860] THIS GUY IS -- WE TALKED ABOUT
[ct=3756.849] HIM BACK IN COVERAGE.
[ct=3758.011] THAT IS HIS GAME.
[ct=3758.842] EITHER RUSHING THE QUARTERBACK
[ct=3761.206] OR SETTING AN EDGE AND FIGHTING
[ct=3762.702] OFF A COUPLE OF BLOCKERS AND HE
[ct=3763.920] FORCES THAT BALL BACK TO THE
[ct=3765.557] INSIDE AND STILL GETS HIS HANDS
[ct=3769.183] ON AND HELPS MAKE THE TACKLE.
[ct=3769.789] GREAT PLAY THERE BY A GUY WHO
[ct=3771.034] HAS BECOME A MENTOR AND LEADER
[ct=3774.887] FOR THIS YOUNG DEFENSE.
[ct=3775.632] >> Al: PATRICK [ INAUDIBLE ]
[ct=3776.667] COMING INTO THE GAME.
[ct=3777.363] FLARE HIM OUT.
[ct=3778.637] THE PASS IS CAUGHT AND THEN
[ct=3780.590] DROPPED OVER THE MIDDLE!
[ct=3782.271] DEEBO SAMUEL WOULD HAVE HAD A
[ct=3784.612] FIRST DOWN AND MAYBE A TOUCHDOWN
[ct=3785.094] HAD HE CAUGHT IT.
[ct=3786.613] NOW THE CROWD, OF COURSE, IS
[ct=3789.218] RESPONDING TO THE FACT, GIMME
[ct=3791.121] THE BALL AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.
[ct=3791.912] >> Kirk: WELL, YOU’RE RIGHT.
[ct=3793.306] IT’S MAN COVERAGE.
[ct=3794.197] WELL DESIGNED.
[ct=3795.301] EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS.
[ct=3796.597] HE JUST STARTS TO LOOK AHEAD OF
[ct=3799.921] WHERE HE WANTS TO RUN WITH THE
[ct=3801.460] FOOTBALL BEFORE HE SECURES IT.
[ct=3804.427] I MEAN, IT’S MAN-TO-MAN.
[ct=3805.246] THERE IS A SAFETY IN THE MIDDLE
[ct=3806.818] BUT BROCK PURDY PUT IT IN FRONT
[ct=3809.937] OF HIM WHERE HE COULD RUN AFTER
[ct=3811.074] THE CATCH WHICH THE NINERS ARE
[ct=3812.908] LEGENDARY FOR AND HE DROPS THE
[ct=3816.581] >> Al: MOODY WITH A 47-YARDER TO
[ct=3818.108] GIVE THE 49ers THE LEAD AND JAKE
[ct=3819.782] MOODY IS ABLE TO BANG THAT ONE
[ct=3820.505] THROUGH.
[ct=3821.767] 8:23 REMAINING IN THE THIRD.
[ct=3825.047] SAMUEL DROPPED IT.
[ct=3826.053] HE MIGHT HAVE HAD SEVEN.
[ct=3827.331] INSTEAD, THEY GET THREE AND
[ct=3829.700] 49ers ARE UP 6-3 ON "THURSDAY
[ct=3831.425] NIGHT FOOTBALL."
[ct=3833.036] MORNING.
[ct=3835.012] THAT IS WHERE HE REBUILT HIS
[ct=3836.073] CONFIDENCE.
[ct=3837.490] GUYS?
[ct=3840.122] >> Al: KIND OF A CRAZY SITUATION
[ct=3840.122] IN THE SUPER BOWL.
[ct=3841.118] LIKE, WHAT?
[ct=3842.649] EVEN KYLE SHANAHAN SAID THEY
[ct=3844.200] LOOKED OVER AND HE SAID, WHAT
[ct=3845.220] JUST HAPPENED?
[ct=3846.459] IT’S BEEN THAT LONG SINCE HE WAS
[ct=3848.327] ABLE TO GET INTO A GAME.
[ct=3849.764] TONIGHT, HE IS BACK IN THERE.
[ct=3851.672] THE RAMS WILL START THIS DRIVE
[ct=3852.938] AT THE 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=3854.234] >> Kirk: WE SEE THESE INJURIES
[ct=3855.158] ALL OVER THE NFL.
[ct=3856.852] I THINK THE MENTAL PART OF
[ct=3859.101] THAT -- YOU REALLY DON’T FULLY
[ct=3860.936] TEST THAT FAST TWITCH UNTIL THE
[ct=3862.749] FIRST TIME YOU GET OUT THERE ON
[ct=3863.264] THE FIELD.
[ct=3864.843] IT’S GREAT THAT IT’S HOLDING UP
[ct=3865.780] AS WELL AS IT IS HERE TONIGHT IN
[ct=3867.002] HIS FIRST GAME BACK.
[ct=3868.762] >> Al: HE HAS PLAYED VERY WELL.
[ct=3874.881] HE PLAYED A LOT AS HE HAS NOT
[ct=3876.827] BEEN ON A PITCH COUNT TONIGHT.
[ct=3878.768] THERE IS DEEBO SAMUEL JUST
[ct=3881.265] RELIVING THAT DROP.
[ct=3883.103] BLAKE CORUM IS THE BACK HERE.
[ct=3884.905] WILLIAMS HAS ALREADY CARRIED 16
[ct=3886.226] TIMES SO CORUM IS GOING TO GET A
[ct=3886.615] SHOT.
[ct=3888.587] HE HAS TWO CARRIES FOR THREE.
[ct=3890.814] KUPP IS IN MOTION.
[ct=3893.631] STAFFORD RETREATS.
[ct=3893.995] UNDER PRESSURE, HE THROWS.
[ct=3897.204] THIS IS CORUM, THE ROOKIE OUT OF
[ct=3899.145] MICHIGAN, PICKING UP 12 AND A
[ct=3900.445] FIRST DOWN FOR LOS ANGELES.
[ct=3901.448] >> Kirk: I’M TELLING YOU, THIS
[ct=3902.475] GUY HAS THAT ABILITY.
[ct=3904.069] HE DROPPED A BALL EARLIER WHEN
[ct=3905.586] THE CONDITIONS WEREN’T THAT
[ct=3907.203] GREAT.
[ct=3907.592] BUT HE DID THIS THROUGHOUT HIS
[ct=3908.998] CAREER AT MICHIGAN.
[ct=3910.826] NOT ONLY A GREAT RUNNER, A VERY
[ct=3912.712] SIMILAR RUNNING STYLE AS
[ct=3914.816] WILLIAMS, BUT ALSO CAN CATCH THE
[ct=3915.916] BALL OUT OF THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=3917.978] NICE BLOCK BY PUKA ON FRED
[ct=3920.600] WARNER TO GET HIM -- SPRING HIM
[ct=3921.802] FREE AND PICK UP THOSE YARDS
[ct=3924.001] AFTER THE CATCH.
[ct=3925.732] >> Al: TWELVE-YARD GAIN AND
[ct=3927.369] LONGEST PLAY OF THE NIGHT FOR
[ct=3931.076] THE LOS ANGELES OFFENSE.
[ct=3938.559] STAFFORD TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=3939.895] THAT IS GOING TO BE TAKEN FOR
[ct=3941.665] ABOUT AN EIGHT-YARD GAME BY
[ct=3943.532] HUNTER LONG, TIGHT END, THE MAN
[ct=3945.454] WHO RETURNED A BLOCKED PUNT FOR
[ct=3947.004] A TOUCHDOWN LAST SUNDAY.
[ct=3948.456] >> Kirk: WITH THESE LINEBACKERS
[ct=3949.712] AND CORNERS DROPPING AND SINKING
[ct=3951.557] IN COVERAGE, SAFETIES ARE
[ct=3952.321] PHYSICALLY TURNING THEIR BODY
[ct=3955.735] AND WAITING FOR -- IN BREAKING
[ct=3957.456] ROUTES THE ANSWER BY SEAN McVAY
[ct=3959.248] IS TO GET THE BALL OUT TO THE
[ct=3962.150] FLAT THERE, ABOUT A BACK OR A
[ct=3962.602] TIGHT END.
[ct=3963.946] GET THE BALL OUT THERE QUICKLY.
[ct=3966.347] >> Al: PICK UP THE PACE AND
[ct=3967.157] GOING NO-HUDDLE HERE.
[ct=3967.944] >> Kirk: SECOND ONE.
[ct=3969.162] >> Al: YEP.
[ct=3973.396] CORUM FIGHTS HIS WAY FOR A FIRST
[ct=3977.033] THAT IS LENOIR MAKING THAT
[ct=3980.903] THE CLOCK TICKS DOWN TO 7:00.
[ct=3982.311] RAMS ARE TRYING TO PICK UP THE
[ct=3983.208] PACE HERE.
[ct=3985.792] AGAIN, THERE IS A LOOK AT LAST
[ct=3986.538] COUPLE OF WEEKS.
[ct=3987.934] WHAT A DIFFERENCE AS PART OF IT.
[ct=3990.081] I LOVED WHAT HE SAID TO KAYLEE
[ct=3991.020] WHEN HE SAID THIS IS JUST ONE OF
[ct=3991.350] THOSE GAMES.
[ct=3993.165] WHEN YOU SAY THAT, THAT MEANS
[ct=3996.291] YOU GOT TO FIND A WAY TO WIN A
[ct=3999.285] DIVISIONAL MATCHUP AS SLOPPY AND
[ct=4000.330] AS UGLY AS IT MIGHT BE.
[ct=4001.550] YOU GOT TO FIND A WAY.
[ct=4002.989] REMEMBER, THEY ARE PLAYING FOR A
[ct=4004.614] CHANCE TO WIN THE LAST FOUR AND
[ct=4005.949] WIN THIS DIVISION.
[ct=4007.687] >> Al: THE UGLY WINS COUNT AS
[ct=4009.414] MUCH AS GORGEOUS WINS.
[ct=4010.337] >> Kirk: THAT’S RIGHT.
[ct=4012.018] >> Al: STAFFORD FIRING IN TO
[ct=4012.316] TRAFFIC.
[ct=4014.767] TIPPED AND INCOMPLETE.
[ct=4018.656] HE TRIED TO GET IT TO COLBY
[ct=4019.572] PARKINSON.
[ct=4021.948] FIRST TIME HE IS TARGETED
[ct=4025.173] WARD AND HUFANGA BRACKETED HIM
[ct=4028.470] >> Kirk: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
[ct=4030.492] TAG THE SHOTS IN THE FLAT.
[ct=4032.111] OH, THEY IT WILL GO IT OUT OF
[ct=4033.924] THE FLAT AND WE GOT TO TAKE THAT
[ct=4034.125] AWAY.
[ct=4036.313] TIMED UP PRETTY WELL BUT LOOK AT
[ct=4037.842] ALL OF THE DEFENSIVE BACKS READY
[ct=4039.305] FOR THAT SHOT DOWN FIELD DOWN
[ct=4042.191] THAT SIDELINE.
[ct=4045.373] WARD IS THERE.
[ct=4046.734] HUE
[ct=4047.392] HUFANGA IS THERE.
[ct=4048.482] THEY TOOK ALL OPTIONS AWAY FROM
[ct=4050.087] STAFFORD ON THAT ROUTE.
[ct=4051.727] >> Al: THEY KNOW THAT RAMS
[ct=4052.442] PLAYBOOK PRETTY WELL.
[ct=4053.078] >> Kirk: THEY ARE DIALED IN
[ct=4055.138] SECOND DOWN AND TEN.
[ct=4060.079] CORUM.
[ct=4061.565] SHORT GAIN.
[ct=4061.565] SO IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND
[ct=4065.095] SEVEN NOW FOR THE RAMS.
[ct=4067.047] 6:20 TO GO IN THE THIRD.
[ct=4068.472] >> Kirk: THE THING THAT HAS BEEN
[ct=4069.350] MOST IMPRESSIVE TO ME IS HOW
[ct=4071.391] THIS 49ers DEFENSIVE LINE THAT
[ct=4074.952] IS USUALLY WHEN YOU THINK OF THE
[ct=4074.952] NINERS DEFENSE
[ct=4075.573] NINERS DEFENSIVE LINE YOU THINK
[ct=4076.789] OF THE ABILITY TO RUSH THE
[ct=4079.679] BUT BOSA BEING BACK HAS GIVEN
[ct=4081.290] THEM SOME TOUGHNESS ON THE EDGE.
[ct=4082.507] LEONARD FLOYD ON THE OTHER SIDE
[ct=4083.784] IS DOING A GREAT JOB.
[ct=4086.967] THE INTERIOR IS HODLE
[ct=4088.746] THE INTERIOR IS HODLDING UP
[ct=4089.316] AGAINST THIS PHYSICAL RAMS
[ct=4090.590] OFFENSIVE LINE AND RUN GAME.
[ct=4091.951] >> Al: WILLIAMS IS BACK IN BUT
[ct=4095.188] HE IS A RECEIVER IN THIS SET.
[ct=4096.849] NACUA COMES IN MOTION.
[ct=4101.928] STAFFORD SLIDING LEFT.
[ct=4103.887] NACUA REACHES UP AND
[ct=4106.603] IN.
[ct=4109.319] A LITTLE BIT SHORT OF THE FIRST.
[ct=4115.797] HIT BY JI’AYIR BROWN.
[ct=4117.310] >> Kirk: WHAT A JOB BY STAFFORD
[ct=4119.357] AND NACUA WHO GOES IN TO MOTION
[ct=4122.441] AND GETS MATCHED UP AGAINST
[ct=4123.747] LENOIR AND IS ABLE TO SEPARATE
[ct=4124.394] BUT HE KNOWS HE’S IN TRAFFIC.
[ct=4126.271] THAT’S A BIG HIT THERE BY THE
[ct=4128.595] SAFETY BROWN BUT, AGAIN, HE
[ct=4129.697] SHOWS THAT TOUGHNESS AND
[ct=4131.865] STRENGTH TO HOLD ON TO IT.
[ct=4132.850] >> Al: HE SNATCHED IT OUT OF THE
[ct=4133.916] AIR.
[ct=4134.737] >> Al: WILLIAMS IS THE
[ct=4136.392] FOURTH AND ONE.
[ct=4141.491] KEEPER.
[ct=4142.077] A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4144.917] STAFFORD TAKES IT HIMSELF.
[ct=4148.172] HE MOVES THE BALL TO THE 35 YARD
[ct=4150.137] >> Kirk: WE WERE TALKING TO HIM
[ct=4151.325] THIS WEEK AND SAYING, DUDE, YOU
[ct=4154.370] LOOK LIKE THE BEST YOU’VE LOOKED
[ct=4154.633] IN YOUR CAREER AS FAST AS YOUR
[ct=4155.068] BODY.
[ct=4156.444] THERE IS BOSA LIMPING OFF THE
[ct=4159.512] HE GOES OVER THAT RIGHT LEG OF
[ct=4161.149] 50, LIMMER, THE CENTER.
[ct=4162.065] PLENTY OF ROOM TO PICK UP THE
[ct=4165.142] HE TALKED ABOUT HOW MAXX CROSBY
[ct=4166.592] AND SOMETHING HE LIVES
[ct=4168.188] YEAR-ROUND AND TAKES CARE OF HIS
[ct=4171.483] BODY LIKE SO MANY GUYS IN THEIR
[ct=4172.390] 30s WITH DIET AND EXERCISE.
[ct=4173.744] THE GUY COMES OUT AND WORKS ON
[ct=4175.612] HIS BODY TO KEEP HIM FEELING
[ct=4176.930] GOOD AS OFTEN AS HE CAN.
[ct=4178.124] >> Al: HE HAS TAKEN EVERY SNAP
[ct=4179.543] THIS SEASON.
[ct=4181.855] IN HIS 16th YEAR IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=4184.393] FIGHTING HIS WAY FOR A FIVE YARD
[ct=4186.884] GAIN IS KYREN WILLIAMS WHO WAS
[ct=4188.152] NOMINATED.
[ct=4189.898] HE IS THE RAMS NOMINEE FOR MAN
[ct=4190.802] OF THE YEAR.
[ct=4192.606] OUTSTANDING YOUNG MAN.
[ct=4194.107] I WATCHED HIM GROW UP AND CALLED
[ct=4196.784] ONE OF HIS FIRST FEW GAMES THAT
[ct=4198.406] HE WAS IN SOUTH BEND AT NOTRE
[ct=4200.336] DAME.
[ct=4202.395] WHAT IS GREAT ABOUT BLAKE CORUM
[ct=4204.143] GETTING MORE CARRIES AND BETTER
[ct=4205.197] ACQUAINTED WITH THIS RAMS
[ct=4207.423] OFFENSE IS HE IS GETTING MORE
[ct=4209.227] TAKES SOME OF THE HEAT OFF OF
[ct=4212.163] KYREN WILLIAMS AND MAYBE IT
[ct=4214.539] EVENTUALLY GOES TO 70, 60, 30,
[ct=4216.173] 40, WHERE THEY ARE BOTH GETTING
[ct=4217.860] THEIR CHANCES.
[ct=4220.552] >> Al: INSTEAD OF 29 CARRIES IN
[ct=4220.752] THE BUFFALO GAME.
[ct=4222.481] HE HAS 17 CARRIES TONIGHT.
[ct=4222.481] >> Kirk: RIGHT.
[ct=4223.299] >> Al: SECOND AND FIVE.
[ct=4223.299] FLAGS.
[ct=4225.746] FOUR.
[ct=4228.713] OFFENSE, NUMBER 79.
[ct=4234.675] >> Al: ROB HAVENSTEIN, THE LAST
[ct=4235.963] OF THE ST. LOUIS RAMS WHO WAS
[ct=4238.000] WITH THEM IN ST. LOUIS IN 2015
[ct=4240.904] YEAR BEFORE THEY MOVED TO L.A.
[ct=4242.268] >> Kirk: BOSA WENT OFF THE FIELD
[ct=4243.937] AND NOW BACK ON THE FIELD HERE.
[ct=4247.721] ALSO DRE GREENLAW WENT OFF THE
[ct=4249.791] FIELD A FEW SNAPS AGO, SO WE
[ct=4251.452] WILL KEEP AN EYE ON HIM AS WELL.
[ct=4252.676] REMEMBER, I DON’T KNOW IF HE’S
[ct=4254.520] ON A PITCH COUNT TONIGHT.
[ct=4256.426] IT DOESN’T LOOK LIKE HE IS IN
[ct=4257.896] ANY KIND OF PAIN BUT HE IS NOT
[ct=4259.510] ON THE FIELD CURRENTLY.
[ct=4260.738] >> Al: HE TOLD KYLE, I WANT TO
[ct=4262.892] PLAY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.
[ct=4265.497] >> Al: THAT IS MY QUARTER.
[ct=4267.450] PASS CAUGHT.
[ct=4271.341] NACUA PROBING, YARDS AFTER
[ct=4272.121] CONTACT.
[ct=4275.356] HE DOES IT ALL.
[ct=4276.917] TO THE 21 YARD LINE GOES PUKA.
[ct=4279.397] >> Kirk: HE IS A TOUGH GUY.
[ct=4281.808] AGAIN, ANY RECEIVER THAT IS
[ct=4283.116] GOING TO COME UNDERNEATH LIKE
[ct=4284.301] THIS, ESPECIALLY ON A QUICK
[ct=4284.760] THROW.
[ct=4287.121] I MEAN, THAT IS NO MAN’S LANDS.
[ct=4287.621] SAFETIES.
[ct=4288.928] LOOK AT THE BLOCKERS DOWN FIELD.
[ct=4290.439] GREAT JOB BY THE RIGHT GUARD
[ct=4293.283] DOTSON GETTING DOWN THE FIELD.
[ct=4294.697] THAT IS NO MAN’S LAND.
[ct=4296.176] YOU COULD TAKE A FOREARM ON THE
[ct=4297.137] CHEST VERY EASILY FROM FRED
[ct=4298.986] WARNER OR A SAFETY.
[ct=4301.729] NICE DRIVE HERE BY THE RAMS, AL.
[ct=4304.325] >> Al: NACUA COMES OUT FOR A
[ct=4305.339] PLAY AND HE’S ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=4306.613] FIRST AND TEN.
[ct=4311.055] 2:40 TO GO IN THE QUARTER.
[ct=4317.378] HE CAN MOVE THAT PILE.
[ct=4318.628] TO THE 18 YARD LINE HE GOES.
[ct=4319.867] SECOND AND SIX AFTER A GAIN OF
[ct=4322.168] >> Kirk: THIS IS THEIR FIRST RED
[ct=4323.453] ZONE TRIP OF THE YEAR.
[ct=4324.989] IF YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE
[ct=4328.462] WAY THE RAMS SEASON HAS GONE, IT
[ct=4329.851] REALLY COMES DOWN TO THE GAMES
[ct=4332.074] THAT THEY ARE WINNING.
[ct=4335.079] THEY ARE SCORING TOUCHDOWNS DOWN
[ct=4337.377] IN THE GAMES THEY HAVE LOST,
[ct=4339.704] MANY CASES, THEY HAVE HAD TO
[ct=4340.678] SETTLE FOR FIELD GOALS.
[ct=4342.891] IN A GAME LIKE THIS, YOU DON’T
[ct=4344.435] KNOW HOW MANY MORE OPPORTUNITIES
[ct=4344.879] YOU’RE GOING TO GET.
[ct=4347.917] >> Al: SECOND AND SIX.
[ct=4356.612] WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE RED ZONE IS
[ct=4357.879] INSIDE THE 20 YARD LINE.
[ct=4360.533] 49ers, I THINK, HAVE GIVEN UP 13
[ct=4361.571] CONSECUTIVE TOUCHDOWNS ON
[ct=4364.575] OPPONENT’S RED ZONE DRIVES.
[ct=4365.533] >> Kirk: IT’S NOT BEEN PRETTY
[ct=4366.646] ALL YEAR FOR THEM BUT THEY GOT
[ct=4374.104] THEM TO THIRD DOWN.
[ct=4374.829] >> Al: THERE IT IS.
[ct=4376.494] LONGEST STREAK SINCE THE COVID
[ct=4378.142] >> Kirk: NACUA HAS BEEN THE
[ct=4379.756] WEAPON, NOT JUST TONIGHT BUT
[ct=4381.777] SINCE HE HAS BEEN BACK HEALTHY.
[ct=4386.109] >> Al: SO A BIG THIRD AND FIVE.
[ct=4390.476] THEY GIVE IT TO WILLIAMS AND HE
[ct=4392.610] GETS THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4395.812] KYREN WILLIAMS TO THE 11 YARD
[ct=4398.580] >> Kirk: WHAT A CALL.
[ct=4399.385] REALLY GOOD CALL.
[ct=4401.635] DAVIS ALLEN, THE ONLY TIGHT END
[ct=4405.627] SEAN McVAY SPREADS THE DEFENSE
[ct=4407.039] OUT WITH RECEIVERS.
[ct=4409.065] NO TIGHT END IN THE END LINE.
[ct=4413.119] THAT WAS THE KEY BLOCK RIGHT
[ct=4414.463] THERE.
[ct=4416.177] AVILA, THE LEFT GUARD, A NICE
[ct=4419.761] JOB THERE OF KICKING OUT
[ct=4422.202] COLLINS.
[ct=4423.230] I THINK NINERS WERE SURPRISED
[ct=4424.096] WITH THAT CALL.
[ct=4426.048] SEAN McVAY WITH A HECK OF A CALL
[ct=4430.195] THERE TO JUST SPRING HIM LOOSE.
[ct=4431.819] >> Al: FINAL MINUTE OF THE
[ct=4432.356] PERIOD.
[ct=4433.389] WILLIAMS, AGAIN.
[ct=4436.530] YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK AT ACE
[ct=4437.436] NUMBERS AND NOT THAT IMPRESSIVE
[ct=4440.175] 21 CARRIES AND 72 YARDS.
[ct=4441.870] YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE GAME TO
[ct=4444.452] R0I6 THE VALUE OF THIS GUY.
[ct=4444.986] >> Kirk: I’M RIGHT THERE WITH
[ct=4445.946] YOU.
[ct=4447.782] WE TALKED AT HALFTIME WHAT ARE
[ct=4449.330] THEY GOING TO DO?
[ct=4454.884] WE SAID HE WOULD BE STUSH BBORN
[ct=4456.318] WORK THE RUN GAME.
[ct=4458.478] 14th PLAY ON THIS DRIVE RIGHT
[ct=4459.763] >> Al: THE DRIVE IS OVER 8:00
[ct=4459.763] LONG.
[ct=4466.997] AND THEY WILL NOT GET A PLAY
[ct=4470.843] THEY WILL CHANGE ENDS
[ct=4475.763] TO THE FOURTH WE GO AND SAN
[ct=4480.253] >> Al: SEATTLE IS 8-5.
[ct=4482.518] TOUGH ONE FOR THEM AT HOME
[ct=4483.120] AGAINST GREEN BAY COMING UP
[ct=4483.817] SUNDAY NIGHT.
[ct=4487.413] RAMS 7-6.
[ct=4488.537] ARIZONA THREE LOSSES IN A ROW
[ct=4490.229] AND 6-7.
[ct=4493.716] THE 49ers TRYING TO HANG IN
[ct=4494.549] THERE TO GET TO .500.
[ct=4496.032] MEANWHILE, THIS IS THE 14th PLAY
[ct=4498.906] OF A DRIVE THAT HAS CONSUMED
[ct=4501.252] 8:23.
[ct=4508.287] IT’S A SECOND AND THREE FROM THE
[ct=4509.561] 4.
[ct=4512.036] STAFFORD IS GOING TO GET AROUND
[ct=4512.669] THE CORNER?
[ct=4512.980] NO.
[ct=4515.113] HE IS PUNCHED UP AT THE 1 YARD
[ct=4517.751] GOT A FLAG ON THE PLAY.
[ct=4521.425] FRED WARNER IS THERE.
[ct=4530.454] THE 49ers CLAPPING, OBVIOUSLY,
[ct=4530.454] TELLING YOU WHO THE PENALTY
[ct=4531.886] AGAINST.
[ct=4534.960] NUMBER 87.
[ct=4538.119] >> Al: ON DAVIS ALLEN.
[ct=4539.665] >> Kirk: THE TIGHT END DAVIS
[ct=4542.570] ALLEN IS TRYING TO MAKE A BLOCK
[ct=4545.763] ON THE CORNER YIADOM.
[ct=4547.088] THERE IS THE GRAB.
[ct=4547.848] HOW ABOUT THE CALL?
[ct=4549.055] LAST GUY IN THE WORLD YOU THINK
[ct=4550.428] IS GOING TO CARRY IT DOWN THERE
[ct=4551.442] IS STAFFORD.
[ct=4551.953] >> Al: WELL, YEAH.
[ct=4554.128] HE HAS IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS
[ct=4556.466] HE HAS ONE RUSHING TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=4557.964] >> Kirk: LOOK AT THAT.
[ct=4560.650] 152 MEETINGS?
[ct=4561.650] >> Kirk: FIRST TIME.
[ct=4565.126] >> Al: ALL THE WAY BACK TO 1950.
[ct=4566.168] RAMS IN THE NFL AT THAT POINT
[ct=4570.106] AND 49ers COMING OUT OF THE OLD
[ct=4571.939] ALL-AMERICA FOOTBALL CONFERENCE.
[ct=4573.371] SECOND DOWN AND 11.
[ct=4574.867] >> Kirk: A HUGE PLAY.
[ct=4575.783] WITHOUT THAT HOLD, THE BALL IS
[ct=4576.941] DOWN TO THE 1 YARD LINE.
[ct=4582.487] >> Al: THREE RECEIVERS OFF TO
[ct=4583.842] THE LEFT.
[ct=4585.996] STAFFORD THROWS ON THE RUN.
[ct=4590.885] NACUA MAKES THE CATCH AT THE 5
[ct=4592.813] >> Kirk: AGAIN, WE SAW STAFFORD
[ct=4594.944] USE HIS LEGS LAST WEEK IN
[ct=4596.124] CRITICAL MOMENTS AGAINST THE
[ct=4597.380] BILLS AND THROWING THE BALL WELL
[ct=4597.901] ON THE RUN.
[ct=4599.464] HERE, WE ARE AT THAT MOMENT.
[ct=4602.990] SEAN McVAY SAYING THE CRITICAL
[ct=4604.103] AREAS MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
[ct=4605.742] HOW WE DO ON THIRD DOWN AND HOW
[ct=4607.602] WE DO ON THE RED ZONE.
[ct=4609.253] ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
[ct=4609.538] SCORE?
[ct=4611.487] THESE ARE THOSE MOMENTS AND
[ct=4612.512] TALKING ABOUT HIS TEAM BEING
[ct=4612.689] RESILIENT.
[ct=4614.267] SO MUCH AT STAKE.
[ct=4617.860] THEY GOT TO CAPITALIZE HERE.
[ct=4625.333] >> Al: STAFFORD UNDER PRESSURE.
[ct=4626.896] AVOIDS THE SACK.
[ct=4629.437] ON THE MOVE.
[ct=4630.807] LEG IS DOWN.
[ct=4633.422] THROW IS TIPPED.
[ct=4638.686] SO THAT WAS A THIRD AND FOUR.
[ct=4642.114] AGAINST THE RAMS.
[ct=4643.441] >> Kirk: RIGHT TACKLE AGAINST
[ct=4644.710] BOSA.
[ct=4646.065] AS GOOD AS HAVENSTEIN IS, WHEN
[ct=4648.740] BOSA IS HEALTHY AND RUSHING A
[ct=4650.130] QUARTERBACK THE WAY HE IS
[ct=4655.385] TONIGHT, THAT IS A TOUGH ASK.
[ct=4658.022] YOU SEE THAT RIGHT ARM GET UP
[ct=4659.398] AROUND THE NECK RIG
[ct=4660.744] >> Referee: TWO FOULS ON THE
[ct=4663.061] PLAY AND BOTH BY THE OFFENSE.
[ct=4665.031] BOTH FOULS WILL BE DECLINED.
[ct=4666.351] HE INELIGIBLE MAN DOWN THE
[ct=4668.959] FIELD, NUMBER 65.
[ct=4671.649] HOLDING, NUMBER 79.
[ct=4672.954] AGAIN, THEY ARE BOTH DECLINED.
[ct=4674.317] IT’S FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=4675.624] >> Al: KYLE DIDN’T WANT TO GIVE
[ct=4676.948] THEM ANOTHER SHOT.
[ct=4679.692] HE WOULD RATHER TAKE HIS CHANCE
[ct=4680.925] AND WORRY ABOUT A 6-6 TIE AND
[ct=4683.612] BREAKING A TIE HERE INSTEAD OF
[ct=4686.503] GIVING UP THE TD.
[ct=4690.458] KARTY COMES IN.
[ct=4694.358] HE HAD ONE EARLIER FROM 48.
[ct=4699.670] THIS ONE IS FROM 23.
[ct=4703.673] ETHAN EVANS TO PUT IT DOWN.
[ct=4724.907] A PAIR OF SIX’S.
[ct=4727.582] STAFFORD TOOK A SHOT DURING THAT
[ct=4728.894] LONG DRIVE.
[ct=4731.531] 17 PLAYS FOR 65 YARDS.
[ct=4732.897] THERE IS THAT SHOT.
[ct=4735.583] MADDEN NFL.
[ct=4736.862] WATCH THE SERIES NOW.
[ct=4739.493] RAMS KICKING OFF HERE.
[ct=4742.244] LINE DRIVE KICK AND IT JUST DOES
[ct=4744.854] GO INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=4746.166] OTHERWISE, IT WOULD HAVE COME
[ct=4746.166] OUT TO THE 40.
[ct=4747.457] TO THE 30 THEY GO.
[ct=4748.800] SAN FRANCISCO BALL.
[ct=4752.823] >> Kirk: LET’S LOOK AT OUR NEXT
[ct=4755.494] GENSTATS.
[ct=4758.260] KOBIE TURNER 20 PRESSURES THIS
[ct=4760.864] SEASON AND MOST IN THE NFL WHILE
[ct=4760.864] DOUBLE TEAMED.
[ct=4762.191] TONIGHT HE HAS BEEN DOUBLE
[ct=4764.824] TEAMED AND ESPECIALLY IN THE
[ct=4766.200] FOUR PRESSURES AND A
[ct=4767.450] SACKS.
[ct=4768.798] NOT BAD.
[ct=4770.141] AND THAT IS THE MOST IN THE
[ct=4771.436] ENTIRE NFL IN A FIRST HALF THIS
[ct=4774.138] HE WILL HAVE TO HAVE A BIG
[ct=4775.426] IMPACT FOR THIS RAMS DEFENSE TO
[ct=4778.103] CONTINUE TO TRY TO HARASS BROCK
[ct=4779.434] PURDY WHEN HE IS BACK THERE
[ct=4779.434] THROWING THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=4783.425] THERE IS A LITTLE FRUSTRATION ON
[ct=4784.753] STAFFORD’S PART.
[ct=4787.386] TURNER, SECOND YEAR GUY OUT OF
[ct=4790.090] WAKE FOREST.
[ct=4794.071] CAUGHT HERE BY SAMUEL.
[ct=4796.725] A GAIN OF FIVE.
[ct=4800.699] AND A PENALTY.
[ct=4817.937] KITTLE INDICATES IT’S HIM.
[ct=4821.970] INELIGIBLE PLAYER DOWN THE
[ct=4824.608] PENALTY IS DECLINED.
[ct=4827.266] PASS INTERFERENCE, NUMBER 85.
[ct=4833.868] >> Al: THERE IS THE BIGGER ONE.
[ct=4835.206] >> Kirk: IT’S A RARE MISTAKE BY
[ct=4837.868] KITTLE, ESPECIALLY IN A FOURTH
[ct=4839.220] QUARTER GAME IN A 6-6 FOOTBALL
[ct=4844.523] HE IS JUST TRYING TO WORK LATE
[ct=4847.164] HE DOES A GOOD JOB THERE.
[ct=4849.785] THE INITIAL CONTACT, HE GRABBED
[ct=4851.157] AHOLD OF HIM AND GOT A HOLD OF
[ct=4852.522] THAT JERSEY.
[ct=4853.826] >> Al: AND HE KNEW IT.
[ct=4860.499] FIRST AND 20.
[ct=4867.098] FOUR-MAN RUSH.
[ct=4869.792] HE CAME IN FROM THE LEFT SIDE.
[ct=4872.442] HE HAD QUENTIN LAKE WHO WAS JUST
[ct=4872.442] INVOLVED IN THE LAST PLAY
[ct=4873.727] BLITZING FROM THE SECONDARY.
[ct=4875.049] SECOND DOWN AND 20.
[ct=4876.415] >> Kirk: YOU HAVEN’T SEEN A TON
[ct=4877.712] OF THAT BUT WHEN THEY HAVE
[ct=4877.712] BROUGHT A LITTLE BIT OF
[ct=4881.688] PRESSURE, IT HAS BEEN FROM THE
[ct=4883.075] EDGE AT 37 FROM THE TOP THERE.
[ct=4885.698] HE IS ABLE TO GET FREE.
[ct=4888.328] HE GETS HIS HANDS UP.
[ct=4889.663] LOOK AT OUR DEFENSIVE ALERTS.
[ct=4892.305] ANY TIME YOU SEE THEE DEFENSIVE
[ct=4899.000] ALERTS, IT’S NOT NECESSARILY WHO
[ct=4900.276] IS GOING TO CO
[ct=4902.965] POTENTIAL THREAT.
[ct=4904.261] THEY WERE ALL OVER IT LAST TIME.
[ct=4905.599] >> Al: THE PASS IS DEEP DOWN THE
[ct=4908.227] INTENDED FOR SAMUEL.
[ct=4921.599] IT IS BUSTED UP BY KAM KINCHENS.
[ct=4921.599] >> Kirk: SAMUEL IS RIGHT HERE.
[ct=4922.868] WATCH THE COVERAGE ON THE BACK
[ct=4922.868] END.
[ct=4925.536] THE BALL HANGS IN THE AIR SO
[ct=4928.183] LONG THAT THE CORNER HERE DOES A
[ct=4930.864] GOOD JOB OF READING IT AND HE’S
[ct=4932.186] IN GOOD POSITION AND HE IS ABLE
[ct=4934.850] TO GET UNDERNEATH THAT AND
[ct=4936.199] KINCHENS ALMOST COMES U
[ct=4937.568] THAT INTERCEPTION.
[ct=4941.494] HE IS A GOOD JOB AS A ROOKIE OUT
[ct=4944.136] OF MIAMI PLAYING CENTER AND
[ct=4945.460] COMING UP WITH SOME PICK
[ct=4946.811] >> Al: VERY GOOD.
[ct=4948.097] DRAW PLAY HERE.
[ct=4949.450] NEEDED 20 AND GOT 16 WITH
[ct=4954.792] GUERENDO TAKING IT UP TO THE
[ct=4960.052] BULL THE PUNT TEAM COMES IN ON
[ct=4966.697] >> Kirk: SO THAT OFFENSIVE PASS
[ct=4966.697] INTERFERENCE REALLY IMPACTS THIS
[ct=4969.399] DRIVE AND GETS THEM WAY BEHIND
[ct=4970.695] THE STICKS, SO THE RAMS GET THE
[ct=4973.388] FOOTBALL BACK HERE.
[ct=4977.565] >> Al: PUNT NUMBER SEVEN FOR PAT
[ct=4978.654] O’DONNELL, AVERAGING 45 YARDS
[ct=4978.654] PER BOOT.
[ct=4979.979] WE GOT A FLAG.
[ct=4984.059] FLAG AT THE INTERCEPTION OF THE
[ct=4986.631] PLAY AND FAIR CAUGHT AT THE
[ct=4990.689] MOMENT AT THE 29 YARD LINE.
[ct=4994.602] SO THAT WAS A PUNT OF 46 YARDS.
[ct=4998.638] AND WE WILL SEE WHAT MR. MARTIN
[ct=4999.924] TELLS US AS HE IS LOOKING OVER
[ct=5001.251] TO THE RAMS BENCH AS IF HOW DO
[ct=5003.903] YOU WANT TO --
[ct=5005.245] >> Referee: ILLEGAL FORMATION,
[ct=5006.560] SAN FRANCISCO, NUMBER 45 WAS
[ct=5007.880] LINED UP IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=5011.241] FIVE-YARD PENALTY FROM THE END
[ct=5011.736] OF THE PLAY.
[ct=5016.648] >> Al: THAT IS WHAT THEY HAVEN
[ct=5017.805] MAX.
[ct=5018.299] DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO IS ABOUT
[ct=5021.216] 44 MILES UP THE 101.
[ct=5023.426] >> Kirk: TELL ME YOU LIKED
[ct=5026.661] "ELF."
[ct=5032.596] >> Al: BEST MOVIE I EVER SAW
[ct=5034.450] ALONG WITH "GONE WITH THE WIND."
[ct=5035.615] STAFFORD GOING DEEP DOWN THE
[ct=5037.993] HE HAS NACUA, TO THE 16 YARD
[ct=5038.572] LINE!
[ct=5044.579] PUKA NACUA GOT FREE AND BIGGEST
[ct=5045.614] PLAY OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=5046.567] >> Kirk: THERE IT IS.
[ct=5047.362] WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THESE
[ct=5049.281] SHOTS DOWN FIELD AND THEY
[ct=5050.964] FINALLY PICKED THE RIGHT TIME.
[ct=5054.888] A LITTLE PLAY SACTION AND CATCH
[ct=5057.573] THEM IN A BLITZ ONE-ON-ONE.
[ct=5059.499] BOY, DOES HE GET BEHIND WARD.
[ct=5060.849] IT’S BEEN SUCH TIGHT COVERAGE ON
[ct=5063.720] THE BACK END WITH THESE 49ers
[ct=5063.897] AND CORNERS AND THE SAFETIES
[ct=5065.902] DIALING UP ANY KIND OF CROSSERS
[ct=5067.636] BUT THIS TIME, THEY TAKE HIM
[ct=5069.039] DOWN THE FIELD BEHIND THE
[ct=5071.576] SAFETIES AND THEY HIT A BIG ONE.
[ct=5074.123] >> Al: 51 YARDS.
[ct=5077.565] RAMS NOW AT THE 16.
[ct=5083.363] WILLIAMS FIGHTING HIS WAY INSIDE
[ct=5085.384] THE 10.
[ct=5089.204] GIPSON MAKES THAT TACKLE.
[ct=5090.212] SECOND AND TWO.
[ct=5091.091] >> Kirk: REALLY GOOD BLOCK BY
[ct=5093.301] PARKINSON, THE TIGHT END ON THE
[ct=5093.754] RIGHT SIDE.
[ct=5095.519] 49ers AFTER 13 STRAIGHT
[ct=5096.959] TOUCHDOWNS THAT YOU REFERRED TO
[ct=5098.912] IN THE RED ZONE AREA, THE LAST
[ct=5101.749] TIME WE SAW, THE LAST TIME THEY
[ct=5103.511] STOPPED THEM AND FORCED THEM TO
[ct=5104.150] KICK A FIELD GOAL.
[ct=5106.716] THERE IS A LOOK AT GREENLAW.
[ct=5107.641] >> Al: STILL ON THE BENCH.
[ct=5112.343] WILLIAMS HAS CARRIED 22 TIMES
[ct=5114.150] MAKE IT 23.
[ct=5118.200] THIS TIME, HE IS WRESTLED DOWN
[ct=5120.895] BY TASHAUN GIPSON.
[ct=5122.978] >> Kaylee: DE GREENLAW HAS BEEN
[ct=5124.932] TAKING DEEP BREATHS WHILE ON THE
[ct=5126.845] SIDELINE ALL OF THIS TIME AND
[ct=5128.682] IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL IF HE IS
[ct=5130.461] BREATHING THROUGH PAIN OR TRYING
[ct=5131.454] TO CATCH HIS BREATH.
[ct=5132.834] WHEN THAT DEFENSE GOT ON THE
[ct=5135.282] FIELD HE DIDN’T MOVE AS IF TO
[ct=5137.442] GRAB HIS HELMET.
[ct=5138.216] HE IS SITTING TIGHT AND
[ct=5140.104] EVERYBODY IS CHECKING ON HIM AND
[ct=5141.451] HE IS OKAY.
[ct=5142.536] >> Al: THERE HE IS.
[ct=5143.988] BUT NOT OKAY READY IT RESUME
[ct=5145.235] ACTION ON THIRD AND TWO WITH
[ct=5155.280] PLAY CLOCK AT 1.
[ct=5160.656] STRAIGHT DROP.
[ct=5160.656] CHASED.
[ct=5161.841] THROWS.
[ct=5164.239] CAUGHT BUT SECURED.
[ct=5165.561] SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5169.445] FRED WARNER MAKES THAT TACKLE.
[ct=5170.742] THE RAMS HAD SECOND AND TWO AND
[ct=5170.742] NOW IT’S A FOURTH AND TWO.
[ct=5174.835] >> Kirk: KYREN WILLIAMS HAS AS
[ct=5176.202] MUCH RESPECT FOR WHAT HE DOES
[ct=5177.453] WITHOUT THE FOOTBALL AS WHAT HE
[ct=5178.713] DOES WITH THE BALL.
[ct=5180.007] HERE HE IS RIGHT HERE.
[ct=5182.770] HE PICKS UP FLOYD RIGHT THERE.
[ct=5184.054] HE PUTS HIM ON HIS BACK AND THEN
[ct=5185.677] LEAKS OUT FOR THAT CHECKDOWN AND
[ct=5188.283] HE ENDS UP CATCHING THE
[ct=5189.923] I THINK THIS IS WHY HIS TEAM
[ct=5190.362] LOVES HIM.
[ct=5193.760] IT’S NOT JUST THE WAY HE RUNS
[ct=5194.142] THE BALL.
[ct=5198.918] GOOD JOB ON THAT BLITZ PICK.
[ct=5201.320] >> Al: JOSH KARTY IS OUT TO GIVE
[ct=5202.118] THEM THE LEAD WITH A 27-YARD
[ct=5202.569] ATTEMPT.
[ct=5212.076] OPERATION PERFECT.
[ct=5212.914] KICK, PERFECT.
[ct=5214.999] 9:30 TO GO IN REGU TIME NOW FOR
[ct=5216.651] THE GAME."
[ct=5218.432] PRESENTED BY PEPSI.
[ct=5220.538] REMEMBER ALL OF THE TALK THIS
[ct=5223.660] WEEK ABOUT DEEBO SAMUEL WANTS TO
[ct=5225.303] GET THE BALL MORE AND THEY ARE
[ct=5227.604] TRYING TO GET HIM THE FOOTBALL
[ct=5227.926] MORE.
[ct=5229.918] IT HAS BEEN A TOUGH NIGHT AS FAR
[ct=5230.530] AS OPPORTUNITIES.
[ct=5231.914] THEY HAVE HANDED THE FOOTBALL TO
[ct=5234.517] HERE, THEY THROW HIM THE BALL.
[ct=5237.143] IF HE CATCHES THAT, IT’S
[ct=5238.476] POTENTIALLY A TOUCHDOWN AGAINST
[ct=5239.053] MAN COVERAGE.
[ct=5241.396] SEVEN TARGETS AND JUST THREE
[ct=5241.993] RECEPTIONS AND 16 YARDS.
[ct=5243.569] HE HAS ALSO CARRIED IT A COUPLE
[ct=5244.799] TIMES FOR THREE MORE YARDS.
[ct=5247.290] SO 19 YARDS.
[ct=5248.378] >> Al: RUN THIS ONE BACK FROM A
[ct=5251.859] COUPLE OF YARDS IN THE END ZONE
[ct=5254.757] AND THERE IS NUMBER 1, SAMUEL,
[ct=5256.079] HE GETS A TOUCH.
[ct=5257.208] WASN’T GOING TO PASS UP AN
[ct=5258.403] OPPORTUNITY, EVEN THOUGH THE
[ct=5259.640] KICK WAS IN THE END ZONE.
[ct=5261.844] >> Al: MEANWHILE, THE DIVISION
[ct=5264.070] PLAYOFF PICTURE RIGHT NOW WITH
[ct=5265.100] THE DIVISION LEADERS UP THERE,
[ct=5266.079] THE WILDCARDS WOULD BE
[ct=5267.586] MINNESOTA, GREEN BAY, AND
[ct=5268.491] WASHINGTON.
[ct=5269.588] RAMS, OF COURSE, VERY MUCH IN
[ct=5269.993] THE HUNT.
[ct=5271.133] FALCONS ARE, TOO.
[ct=5272.446] CARDINALS ARE AS WELL.
[ct=5274.759] AND FOR THE 49ers, AS WE
[ct=5276.909] MENTIONED AT THE TOP OF THE GAME
[ct=5277.732] TONIGHT, MAN, THIS IS ALMOST
[ct=5279.759] LIKE UNDER YOU’RE ON LIFE
[ct=5283.164] SUPPORT IF YOU DON’T WIN THIS
[ct=5285.911] >> Kirk: IT’S DESPERATION TIME.
[ct=5289.944] >> Al: FROM THE 28 YARD LINE.
[ct=5299.330] GUERENDO AND TAKEN OUT OF BOUNDS
[ct=5303.395] AFTER A VERY MINIMAL GAIN BY
[ct=5304.758] QUENTIN LAKE.
[ct=5306.861] >> Kirk: YOU LOOK AT THE
[ct=5309.812] STANDINGS IN DECEMBER AND I
[ct=5314.196] THINK MATTHEW STAFFORD FEELS
[ct=5315.102] IT’S DESPERATION TIME.
[ct=5317.370] A GAME BACK BEHIND SEATTLE IN
[ct=5317.680] THEIR DIVISION.
[ct=5319.035] THEY LOOK WHO THEY HAVE TO PLAY
[ct=5320.401] TONIGHT AND LOOK AT THE REST OF
[ct=5320.639] THE YEAR.
[ct=5322.689] THEY GOT SEATTLE AT THE END OF
[ct=5324.678] SO STILL IN A SPOT TO BE ABLE TO
[ct=5326.060] WIN THIS DIVISION BUT THEY HAVE
[ct=5329.242] GOT TO WIN TONIGHT.
[ct=5331.554] SAN FRAN IS AT MIAMI AND THEN
[ct=5333.318] DETROIT COMES IN HERE AND THEY
[ct=5334.721] FINISH AT ARIZONA.
[ct=5338.341] JUSZCZYK IN MOTION.
[ct=5338.943] PURDY STEPS UP.
[ct=5340.353] STEPS AWAY.
[ct=5342.036] CATCH IS MADE.
[ct=5343.245] THAT WAS RICKY PEARSALL MAKING
[ct=5344.239] THE GRAB.
[ct=5348.523] PEARSALL IS THE KID, THE NUMBER
[ct=5349.247] ONE DRAFT CHOICE.
[ct=5351.900] HE WAS SHOT IN A ROBBERY IN SAN
[ct=5353.128] FRANCISCO IN THE SUMMERTIME.
[ct=5355.552] HE SPENT SIX WEEKS OUT.
[ct=5357.373] HE HAS COME BACK STRONG.
[ct=5358.637] >> Kirk: WATCH PURDY HAS TO WORK
[ct=5361.400] AND FEEL IN THE POCKET.
[ct=5361.709] STEP AWAY.
[ct=5364.303] AS HE IS FALLING BACK, HE IS
[ct=5365.857] ABLE TO KEEP HIS EYES DOWN THE
[ct=5367.160] FIELD AND MAKE AN ACCURATE THROW
[ct=5368.777] TO PEARSALL.
[ct=5369.350] REALLY GOOD FEEL IN THE POCKET
[ct=5372.242] THAT TIME BY BROCK PURDY.
[ct=5374.634] >> Al: NUMBER ONE PICK, THE
[ct=5378.426] ROOKIE OUT OF FLORIDA.
[ct=5381.440] GUERENDO ABOUT TWO AND A HALF TO
[ct=5383.156] STOPPED THERE.
[ct=5384.651] UNDER 8:00 NOW TO PLAY IN
[ct=5386.040] REGULATION.
[ct=5386.372] >> Kirk: PRETTY AMAZING WHEN WE
[ct=5387.988] JUST TALKED ABOUT WITH DEEBO
[ct=5389.502] SAMUEL.
[ct=5389.861] WE TALKED ABOUT HIM BEING VOCAL
[ct=5391.326] AND WANTING THE BALL MORE.
[ct=5392.901] IT’S BEEN FOUR STRAIGHT GAMES.
[ct=5395.733] THIS WILL BE THE FIFTH GAME.
[ct=5398.285] THERE IS KOBII TURNER.
[ct=5399.846] A IMPORTANT PART OF THE DEFENSE.
[ct=5401.425] FIFTH STRAIGHT GAME HE HAS BEEN
[ct=5402.649] HELD UNDER 40 YARDS FROM
[ct=5406.852] YOU NEVER THINK THAT WHEN YOU
[ct=5409.795] THINK OF DEEBO SAMUEL.
[ct=5412.046] ESPECIALLY WHEN McCAFFREY AND
[ct=5412.046] AIYUK ARE DOWN.
[ct=5417.354] THAT IS ONE OF YOUR GUIYS, RIGHT
[ct=5418.466] >> Al: VERY IMPORTANT.
[ct=5420.699] CATCH MADE HERE AND FIRST DOWN
[ct=5422.002] AND HOG TIED TO THE GROUND IS
[ct=5422.401] GEORGE KITTLE.
[ct=5427.208] >> Kirk: WHETHER IT’S MAN
[ct=5429.530] COVERAGE OR ZONE, YOU CAN ALWAYS
[ct=5430.613] COUNT ON KITTLE BEING ABLE TO
[ct=5432.444] WIN AND ABLE TO SEPARATE AGAINST
[ct=5433.030] MAN.
[ct=5434.440] THIS TIME, IT’S ZONE SO HE GETS
[ct=5435.609] BETWEEN THOSE TWO LINEBACKERS
[ct=5437.441] AND THE TIMING WITH BROCK PURDY.
[ct=5438.526] HE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE THAT BALL
[ct=5440.170] NEEDED TO BE THROWN, RIGHT
[ct=5442.292] BETWEEN THE TWO INSIDE
[ct=5442.672] LINEBACKERS.
[ct=5442.672] GOOD THROW.
[ct=5443.095] ACCURATE THROW.
[ct=5446.261] GIVES KITTLE A CHANCE.
[ct=5450.875] >> Al: KITTLE HAS CAUGHT FOUR
[ct=5451.295] FOR 61 YARDS.
[ct=5453.592] HE HAS BEEN THEIR TOP RECEIVER.
[ct=5454.342] FIRST DOWN FROM THE 43.
[ct=5456.814] PURDY GOING DEEP!
[ct=5463.743] PEERSALL WAS THE INTENDED
[ct=5466.776] RECEIVER AND WITHERSPOON GETTING
[ct=5475.395] TO PLAY TONIGHT BECAUSE COBIE
[ct=5476.030] DURANT IS HURT.
[ct=5479.334] >> Kirk: PEARSALL CAN GET DOWN
[ct=5480.441] THE FIELD IN A HURRY AND HE IS
[ct=5482.528] STEPPING IN FOR DURANT.
[ct=5483.525] MAYBE A LITTLE BIT LATE BECAUSE
[ct=5484.737] PEARSALL GOT THE SEAM.
[ct=5485.455] HE HAD A CHANCE.
[ct=5487.693] THERE IS THE LENGTH OF
[ct=5489.040] WITHERSPOON TO KNOCK THAT
[ct=5491.359] FOOTBALL AWAY BUT PEARSALL HAD
[ct=5492.409] TO SLOW DOWN AND COME BACK TO
[ct=5494.379] THAT FOOTBALL.
[ct=5495.296] >> Al: WITHERSPOON ACTIVATED
[ct=5498.670] FROM THE PRACTICE SQUAD.
[ct=5501.372] GUERENDO HAS A HOLE THROUGH THE
[ct=5503.527] MIDDLE AND TRY TO BACK HIS WAY
[ct=5505.523] TO THE LINE TO GAIN AND MAY HAVE
[ct=5505.922] DONE THAT.
[ct=5507.427] WE WILL SEE WHERE THEY SPOT IT
[ct=5510.771] BUT A SECOND AND TEN.
[ct=5512.373] HE COMES UP A LITTLE BIT SHORT.
[ct=5515.797] >> Kirk: THE 49ers OFFICERS LINE
[ct=5518.203] CAN BE PHYSICAL AND LEAN ON YOU.
[ct=5519.852] THE ROOKIE RIGHT GUARD PUNI WITH
[ct=5520.878] AN AMAZING BLOCK.
[ct=5524.748] YOU’LL SEE HIM BACK HERE.
[ct=5525.846] DRIVING JOHNSON AND OPENING THAT
[ct=5528.249] HOLE UP.
[ct=5530.142] >> Al: THEY GIVE THEM A FIRST
[ct=5530.915] DOWN AS THEY SPOT THE BALL.
[ct=5533.038] NOW TAKE A LOOK AT THE CHAINS.
[ct=5538.890] >> Kirk: 68 McKIVITZ MAKES A
[ct=5539.107] NICE BLOCK.
[ct=5542.088] SOMETHING ABOUT YOU PUT A GUY IN
[ct=5543.290] A SAN FRANCISCO 49ers JERSEY AND
[ct=5545.143] YOU PUT HIM IN THAT TAILBACK
[ct=5547.953] SPOT AND HE IS GOING TO BE
[ct=5550.138] PRODUCTIVE.
[ct=5550.383] >> Al: JUSZCZYK IS THE FULLBACK
[ct=5551.026] LEADING THE WAY BUT NOTHING
[ct=5557.352] SO GUERENDO -- THE QUESTION AS
[ct=5559.647] OF 24 HOURS AGO IS WOULD HE
[ct=5562.656] HE HAS CARRIED 16 TIMES FOR 55
[ct=5564.966] ESPECIALLY ON A SHORT WEEK.
[ct=5566.112] I THINK THEY FELT IF IT WAS A
[ct=5567.837] FULL WEEK, HE WOULDN’T HAVE HAD
[ct=5569.549] ANY PROBLEM.
[ct=5570.150] THEY REALLY DIDN’T KNOW, LIKE
[ct=5572.107] YOU SAY, AL, UNTIL THEY CAME OUT
[ct=5574.488] HERE TONIGHT.
[ct=5574.770] I THINK THEY THOUGHT SAMUEL
[ct=5575.572] MIGHT HAVE TO HAVE A FEW MORE
[ct=5577.310] CARRIES AND HE HAS UP TO THIS
[ct=5578.524] POINT RUNNING THE BALL.
[ct=5582.207] I THINK HE’S HAD A COUPLE OF
[ct=5583.897] CARRIES.
[ct=5587.009] >> Al: KOBIE TURNER IS BACK IN
[ct=5589.180] ALONG THAT DEFENSIVE FRONT.
[ct=5591.601] SECOND AND 11.
[ct=5593.243] 5:30 LEFT IN THE FOURTH.
[ct=5595.319] TAYLOR IS THE RUNNING BACK.
[ct=5597.845] PURDY GOING FOR IT ALL!
[ct=5598.339] AND IT’S GOING TO BE PICKED OFF
[ct=5598.822] IN THE END ZONE!
[ct=5603.722] DARIOUS WILLIAMS ON AN
[ct=5606.275] OVERTHROW.
[ct=5610.491] AND THE RAMS GET THE TAKEAWAY.
[ct=5614.949] 5:14 LEFT AFTER THE PICK.
[ct=5615.346] 9-6 RAMS.
[ct=5618.373] >> Kirk: GO BACK AND LOOK AT
[ct=5620.708] THIS PLAY WITH PEARSALL ON THE
[ct=5622.533] LEFT.
[ct=5623.248] HE GETS A LITTLE CONFUSED AND
[ct=5624.274] JUMPS BACK.
[ct=5626.398] LOOK AT THE RAMS DEFENSE REACT
[ct=5627.178] TO THIS.
[ct=5630.954] LAKE HERE AND THEY PLAY COVER
[ct=5633.173] SO REALLY GOOD JOB THERE BY
[ct=5635.405] HE IS NOT GOING TO LET THAT
[ct=5636.856] LITTLE STUTTER AND GO EFFECT
[ct=5639.556] THE REASON THE BALL IS
[ct=5642.126] UNDERTHROWN A BIT IS THE
[ct=5647.499] PRESSURE BY FISKE AND NUMBER 91
[ct=5651.458] KOBIE TURNER AND NOT BEING
[ct=5652.595] FOOLED BY JAUAN JENNINGS WITH
[ct=5654.912] THAT STUTTER AND GO AND HE COMES
[ct=5656.661] UP WITH A HUGE PICK THERE
[ct=5658.047] THE RAMS.
[ct=5659.261] >> Al: DARIOUS WILLIAMS, SEVEN
[ct=5663.248] YEARS IN THE LEAGUE, MAKES A BIG
[ct=5665.249] PLAY HERE AND GIVES THE RAMS THE
[ct=5667.185] BALL WITH 5:14.
[ct=5668.548] STAFFORD THROWS.
[ct=5669.493] IT MAY HAVE BEEN TIPPED.
[ct=5671.361] ATWELL IS THERE.
[ct=5674.650] TUTU ATWELL HAULS IT IN WITH A
[ct=5675.603] GAIN OF SIX.
[ct=5681.141] >> Kirk: OFF THE EDGE AND 45
[ct=5682.570] KNOCKED THAT BALL DOWN ON THE
[ct=5685.052] EDGE IS FLANNIGAN FOWLES.
[ct=5686.439] HE KNOCKS IT DOWN.
[ct=5689.164] TUTU ATWELL, WE HAVEN’T SEEN HIM
[ct=5690.147] MUCH TONIGHT.
[ct=5692.518] NOT ONLY POSITIVE YARDS, BUT,
[ct=5694.393] MORE IMPORTANTLY, HE KEEPS THAT
[ct=5698.541] BUFFALO HAS SEEN ENOUGH OF HIM.
[ct=5700.500] HE MADE THAT PLAY LAST WEEK.
[ct=5703.282] SECOND DOWN AND FOUR.
[ct=5705.759] ROLLING.
[ct=5708.574] THAT WILL MOVE THE STICKS.
[ct=5710.192] HUNTER LONG MAKES THE CATCH FOR
[ct=5711.644] >> Kirk: HOW ABOUT THE CALLS
[ct=5713.258] HERE BY SEAN McVAY?
[ct=5714.851] COME UP WITH A BIG INTERCEPTION.
[ct=5716.453] YOU’RE IN THAT FOUR-MINUTE
[ct=5717.734] OFFENSE, MEANING YOU NEED TO
[ct=5719.031] WORK THE CLOCK AND RUN THE
[ct=5721.597] INSTEAD, THE FIRST TWO PLAYS, A
[ct=5722.945] QUICK THROW OUT TO THE RIGHT
[ct=5725.902] THAT ATWELL ADJUSTS TO AND COME
[ct=5726.767] THEY ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO RUN
[ct=5729.688] THE BALL HERE ON THIS -- NO.
[ct=5730.670] BOOT.
[ct=5731.423] GET STAFFORD AWAY FROM THE
[ct=5733.134] PRESSURE AND YOU GET A NEW SET
[ct=5736.153] OF DOWNS.
[ct=5747.416] >> Al: WILLIAMS EXPLOITS THAT
[ct=5751.667] HOLE AND FORWARD PROGRESS.
[ct=5753.255] FRED WARNER MAKING THE TACKLE.
[ct=5756.132] THEY WILL SPOT IT A LITTLE BIT
[ct=5757.038] SHORT.
[ct=5758.300] >> Kirk: THIS IS A DIFFERENT
[ct=5759.825] DEFENSE TONIGHT WITHOUT DRE
[ct=5760.994] GREENLAW IN THE MIDDLE.
[ct=5763.178] WE KNOW HOW GREAT THIS GUY IS,
[ct=5764.190] FRED WARNER.
[ct=5767.146] BUT WITHOUT HIS SIDE KICK, IT
[ct=5768.533] JUST DOESN’T HAVE THAT SAME FEEL
[ct=5771.130] RAMS ABLE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL
[ct=5774.132] THEY CONTROL THE LINE OF
[ct=5775.755] SCRIMMAGE AND GET KYREN WILLIAMS
[ct=5776.865] WHO RUNS PHYSICALLY AND TOUGH
[ct=5780.078] AND GET HIM RUNNING DOWNHILL.
[ct=5782.517] >> Al: SECOND AND ONE.
[ct=5787.622] STAFFORD KEEPS IT HIMSELF AND HE
[ct=5790.858] HAS THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5791.291] THAT CLOCK KEEPS ON RUNNING
[ct=5794.677] 49ers HAVE ALL OF THEIR
[ct=5795.610] TIME-OUTS.
[ct=5798.071] YOU ALSO HAVE THE TWO MINUTE
[ct=5799.804] WASHING, SO A TON OF TIME, BUT
[ct=5801.790] YOU NEED TO STOP THEM.
[ct=5803.469] >> Kirk: THINK ABOUT THIS RAMS
[ct=5806.121] ALL OF THE INJURIES.
[ct=5807.702] YOU GOT A VETERAN QUARTERBACK.
[ct=5809.530] THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT -- YOU
[ct=5812.750] AND I HAD THEM EARLIER IN THE
[ct=5813.658] YEAR AGAINST THE VIKINGS AND
[ct=5815.619] MAYBE MOVE HIM AND COOPER KUPP.
[ct=5817.198] WE TALKED ABOUT THAT EARLIER.
[ct=5819.954] AFTER STARTING 1-4, THEY HAVE
[ct=5822.046] WON 6 OF THEIR LAST 8 AND NOW ON
[ct=5826.920] THE ROPES IN A HECK OF A GAME IN
[ct=5828.374] A DIVISION.
[ct=5831.166] >> Al: VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT
[ct=5831.486] HAPPENED LAST YEAR.
[ct=5833.654] ROLLING AND CAUGHT AND IN TO
[ct=5835.620] 49er TERRITORY GOES COLBY
[ct=5838.187] THAT STOPS THE CLOCK.
[ct=5839.940] 3:01 IN REGULATION.
[ct=5840.740] >> Kirk: I LIKE WHAT HE DOES
[ct=5842.924] THIS IS EARLIER IN THE GAME,
[ct=5846.178] WATCH THIS THROW RIGHT HERE WITH
[ct=5847.974] PUKA NACUA COMING OFF THIS.
[ct=5848.757] YOU BOOT.
[ct=5849.936] YOU ROLL.
[ct=5850.774] THE DEFENSE COLLAPSES.
[ct=5853.867] LOOK AT THAT OUT THERE OUT IN
[ct=5855.250] THAT DEEP CORNER ROUTE BUT HE
[ct=5857.932] TAKES A SAFER ROUTE, WHICH IS
[ct=5858.697] TOTAL UNDERSTANDABLE.
[ct=5860.658] HE WANTS TO BE SAFE AND HE WANTS
[ct=5864.373] TO GET A COMPLETION.
[ct=5869.250] THAT WAS A BIG PLAY DOWN FIELD.
[ct=5873.082] >> Al: SECOND AND THREE.
[ct=5874.974] TO THE OUTSIDE THIS TIME.
[ct=5876.451] TURNING IT BACK.
[ct=5877.767] SPINNING.
[ct=5882.098] SO WILLIAMS, LAST WEEK, CARRIED
[ct=5882.504] 29 TIMES.
[ct=5885.064] HERE IT IS, 96 HOURS LATER, HE
[ct=5886.892] HAS CARRIED 25 TIMES WITH
[ct=5888.679] PROBABLY A COUPLE MORE TO COME.
[ct=5889.802] >> Kirk: OH, IT’S IMPRESSIVE.
[ct=5891.600] WATCH 79, THE RIGHT TACKLE,
[ct=5895.363] HAVENSTEIN, TURNS HIS BODY AND
[ct=5896.824] THE DEFENDER GOES WITH HIM TO BE
[ct=5900.442] ABLE TO ALLOW KYREN WILLIAMS TO
[ct=5900.738] BE ABLE TO GET OUT TO THAT EDGE
[ct=5904.509] AND THE SPIN MOVE OFF THE
[ct=5906.304] SAFETY, JI’AYIR BROWN.
[ct=5909.358] THE KID RUNS ANGRY.
[ct=5909.358] >> Al: 25 CARRIES AND 98 YARDS.
[ct=5921.609] WHY NOT?
[ct=5924.373] TO THE 34.
[ct=5924.373] CARRY NUMBER 26.
[ct=5927.233] WARNER MAKES THE TACKLE.
[ct=5929.427] THE 49ers ARE GOING TO SPEND
[ct=5932.277] THEIR FIRST TIME-OUT HERE ON THE
[ct=5934.075] FRONT SIDE OF THE TWO-MINUTE
[ct=5934.075] WARNING.
[ct=5934.901] >> Referee: TIME-OUT, SAN
[ct=5936.853] FRANCISCO, THEIR FIRST.
[ct=5937.711] 30 SECONDS.
[ct=5939.639] PLEASE SET THE GAME CLOCK --
[ct=5941.360] >> Kirk: LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT
[ct=5944.788] OUR NEXT GEN
[ct=5946.383] PLAYOFF PROBABILITY.
[ct=5949.361] THE RAMS WITH A WIN.
[ct=5950.445] 50% IF THEY WOULD LOSE TONIGHT
[ct=5951.888] AND DROP DOWN TO 23%.
[ct=5954.385] YOU CAN SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF A
[ct=5955.701] WIN TONIGHT.
[ct=5957.755] ON THE OTHER SIDE, BOY, THE
[ct=5960.538] NINERS BACKED INTO A CORNER WITH
[ct=5961.341] ALL OF THESE INJURIES, HAD TO
[ct=5964.409] WIN THIS FOOTBALL GAME TONIGHT.
[ct=5968.710] IF NOT, THEY ARE DOWN TO 0.1.
[ct=5972.114] >> Al: DOWN TO 0.1 OF 1% WHICH I
[ct=5973.147] SAID AT THE BEGINNING WAS LIFE
[ct=5974.520] SUPPORT.
[ct=5985.098] >> Kirk: NINERS TWO TIMESOUT AND
[ct=5986.691] THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING AND
[ct=5989.828] TRYING TO HOLD THE RAMS TO A
[ct=5991.855] FIELD GOAL HERE.
[ct=5992.669] >> Al: PLAY CLOCK RAN OUT.
[ct=5994.097] THE RAMS HAVE TO TAKE A
[ct=5996.442] >> Referee: RAMS TIME-OUT.
[ct=5998.941] THEIR FIRST.
[ct=6000.580] >> Al: I THINK BOTH TEAMS, KYLE
[ct=6002.404] SHANAHAN SAYING YESTERDAY, I
[ct=6004.686] WANT TO SEE MORE GRIT.
[ct=6010.033] IT’S BEEN GRITTY GAME.
[ct=6011.012] >> Kirk: SLOPPY IN THE FIRST
[ct=6012.208] HALF BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER.
[ct=6013.883] LETS NOT JUST PUT THIS ONE AWAY.
[ct=6018.543] AS YOU KNOW, THE RAMS ARE TRYING
[ct=6018.888] TO BE AGGRESSIVE AND WE HAVE
[ct=6019.939] BEEN AGGRESSIVE ON THIS DRIVE.
[ct=6021.502] 49ers WITH TWO TIME-OUTS AND
[ct=6022.867] TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=6024.225] IF THEY CAN HOLD THE RAMS TO A
[ct=6026.500] FIELD GOAL AND GET THE BALL BACK
[ct=6028.944] TO BROCK PURDY, THEY ARE STILL
[ct=6030.829] THINKING ABOUT HAVING A SHOT TO
[ct=6031.678] WIN THIS FOOTBALL GAME.
[ct=6035.373] I WANT TO SEE HOW SEAN McVAY
[ct=6039.038] APPROACHES THIS KNOWING THAT
[ct=6040.838] KYLE HSHANAHAN WANTS HIS HANDS
[ct=6042.195] BACK ON THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=6047.746] GIVE IT TO NACUA ON A SWEEP.
[ct=6051.405] AND HE’LL TAKE IT TO THE 32 AND
[ct=6053.876] THE 49ers WILL LET THE CLOCK RUN
[ct=6054.695] TO THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=6056.507] I THINK A TIME-OUT ON THE FRONT
[ct=6057.179] SIDE OF IT.
[ct=6060.175] THIRD DOWN AND FOUR WHEN PLAY
[ct=6060.411] RESUMES.
[ct=6065.393] WE ARE IN SANTA CLARA.
[ct=6075.855] >> Al: SO TWO MINUTES TO GO, A
[ct=6078.965] HUGE PLAY, THIRD DOWN AND FOUR.
[ct=6079.698] RIGHT NOW, IF THEY DON’T GAIN A
[ct=6082.758] YARD, YOU’LL LOOK AT KARTY
[ct=6084.790] TRYING TO KICK A 50-YARD FIELD
[ct=6085.331] GOAL.
[ct=6087.316] IF THEY PICK UP A FIRST DOWN, IT
[ct=6088.336] WILL BE TOUGH FOR SAN FRANCISCO
[ct=6090.284] TO GET THE BALL BACK, BUT THEY
[ct=6095.419] DO HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS, BUT, BUT.
[ct=6098.735] THREE-RECEIVER SET TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=6099.814] KUPP COMES THIS WAY.
[ct=6102.780] 2 X2.
[ct=6105.282] PASS IS CAUGHT AND INSIDE THE 20
[ct=6107.642] AND SPUN DOWN IS COLBY
[ct=6110.879] >> Kirk: SEAN McVAY WILL TELL
[ct=6112.546] YOU THAT HIS MOTIONS ARE AS
[ct=6113.962] IMPORTANT AT THE PLAY CALL
[ct=6113.962] THEMSELVES.
[ct=6116.505] HERE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT.
[ct=6118.481] >> Referee: TIME-OUT.
[ct=6119.910] >> Kirk: WHEN COOPER KUPP MOVED,
[ct=6121.672] HE TOOK TWO DEFENDERS WITH HIM
[ct=6124.225] AND THIS OPENS -- TWO DEFENDERS.
[ct=6126.683] IT OPENS IT UP PERFECTLY.
[ct=6127.352] GREAT RECOGNITION
[ct=6128.287] >> Kirk: AGAIN, JUST TO
[ct=6129.469] REITERATE.
[ct=6130.806] THE PRESNAP MOVEMENT.
[ct=6132.940] WATCH 2 AND 29 GO WITH IT.
[ct=6134.349] NOBODY IS ON THE TIGHT END.
[ct=6135.475] LOOK AT HOW COOL STAFFORD IS.
[ct=6136.015] HE KNOWS WHAT HE HAS ALREADY.
[ct=6139.020] HE JUST WAITS FOR THEM TO GET
[ct=6141.073] THERE AND THROWS IT TO A SPOT
[ct=6143.259] AND GETS THAT CRITICAL FIRST
[ct=6147.139] >> Al: YEAH, RAMS USE THAT ON A
[ct=6150.606] VAST MAJORITY OF PLAYS.
[ct=6151.167] MOTION ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
[ct=6153.590] IT’S MORE THAN EYE CANDY.
[ct=6157.152] MEANWHILE, HERE -- ANGLING HIS
[ct=6158.605] WAY FOR AN EXTRA COUPLE OF
[ct=6162.992] AND THE 49ers NOW COMPELLED --
[ct=6163.938] >> Referee: THIRD AND FINAL
[ct=6166.562] TIME-OUT FOR SAN FRANCISCO.
[ct=6167.920] >> Kirk: I THINK THEY USE IT 82%
[ct=6168.990] OF THE TIME.
[ct=6171.085] THEY USE IT MORE THAN ANYBODY
[ct=6171.985] ELSE IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=6175.361] AND, YET, IT’S THAT PLAY AND
[ct=6177.058] THAT MOMENT WHERE THE NINERS
[ct=6179.045] HAVE A BUST AND IT’S HAPPENED
[ct=6180.344] THE ENTIRE GAME WHERE THEY
[ct=6182.812] HAVEN’T HAD A BUST.
[ct=6183.801] >> Al: AND THEY VARY IT SO MUCH.
[ct=6184.560] SOMETIMES, THEY WILL TROT AND
[ct=6186.535] SOMETIMES THEY GO FULL SPEED,
[ct=6188.237] SOMETIMES THEY GO BACK AND FORTH
[ct=6190.102] WITH THE SAME GUY.
[ct=6191.964] JCPENNEY POSTGAME IS COMING UP
[ct=6193.216] AFTER THE GAME SO STICK AROUND
[ct=6193.958] FOR THAT.
[ct=6197.104] SECOND DOWN AND SEVEN.
[ct=6200.907] THEY TAKE ALL THE THEY CAN OFF
[ct=6202.595] THE CLOCK HERE.
[ct=6205.754] THIS TIME, THE 49ers WERE ABLE
[ct=6207.453] TO BUNCH THEM UP AT THE LINE OF
[ct=6212.102] SCRIMMAGE ON KYREN WILLIAMS’
[ct=6213.840] 28th CARRY FOR 105 YARDS.
[ct=6215.318] POSTGAME IS COMING UP WITH
[ct=6218.452] CHARISSA AND THE GANG
[ct=6220.822] EXCLUSIVELY ON PRIME VIDEO.
[ct=6222.840] THE JCPENNEY POSTGAME SHOW WITH
[ct=6223.158] THE GANG.
[ct=6225.082] >> Kirk: THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO
[ct=6225.553] TAKE THIS CLOCK DOWN TO AROUND
[ct=6228.705] THE 25-SECOND MARK, ROUGHLY.
[ct=6229.793] HERE IS THE RAMS SCHEDULE AND
[ct=6231.347] WHAT THEY HAVE LEFT.
[ct=6234.297] THE JETS, ARIZONA, AND THEN
[ct=6237.207] SEATTLE WEEK 18.
[ct=6238.968] A LOT ON THE TABLE IN THAT
[ct=6241.691] WINNER TAKE ALL POSSIBLY.
[ct=6242.946] >> Al: TWO DIVISION GAMES AT
[ct=6247.629] SoFI THE LAST TWO WEEKS OF THE
[ct=6248.782] ONE ON THE PLAY CLOCK.
[ct=6250.349] TO THE 11 YARD LINE GOES
[ct=6255.592] SO NOW CLOCK IS UNDER A HIN
[ct=6256.107] SO NOW CLOCK IS UNDER A HMINUTE
[ct=6257.113] AND DOWN TO THE 20-SECOND MARK
[ct=6262.644] >> Kirk: McVAY WILL LET IT JUST
[ct=6265.278] GO DOWN AND HE IS ALWAYS TALKING
[ct=6266.544] TO THE REFEREE AND TAKE A
[ct=6270.237] TIME-OUT WITH ONE SECOND.
[ct=6274.158] >> Al: YOU KNOW, BACK IN THE
[ct=6277.144] YEAR ONE OF "THURSDAY NIGHT
[ct=6278.025] FOOTBALL," WE HAD -- I THINK WE
[ct=6285.297] HAD A 9-6
[ct=6286.640] >> Kirk: WAS THAT INDY/DENVER?
[ct=6287.505] >> Al: HOW COULD YOU FORGET?
[ct=6287.942] >> Kirk: I FORGOT THE SCORE.
[ct=6288.374] THAT WAS O.T., WASN’T IT?
[ct=6290.256] >> Al: AND YOU SAID HOW CAN THEY
[ct=6291.775] LEAD GOING OVER?
[ct=6293.592] NOT THIS GAME.
[ct=6294.970] THIS WAS FOR 9-6 GAME OR
[ct=6297.672] WHATEVER IT WINDS UP, MAYBE
[ct=6300.411] 12-6.
[ct=6301.691] >> Kirk: TOUGH CONDITIONS.
[ct=6304.421] >> Al: FOR SURE, TOUGH
[ct=6306.770] CONDITIONS.
[ct=6309.311] >> Referee: PLEASE SET THE GAME
[ct=6309.626] CLOCK --
[ct=6312.334] >> Al: PLAYOFF PICTURE.
[ct=6313.059] DETROIT ONE SEED AT THE MOMENT.
[ct=6315.646] PHILADELPHIA ON THEIR HEELS WITH
[ct=6315.884] ONE SEED.
[ct=6317.675] THEN SEATTLE AND TAMPA.
[ct=6318.656] THE OTHER DIVISIONS WITH
[ct=6325.469] WASHINGTON ARE THE WILDCARDS AT
[ct=6326.133] THE MOMENT BUT THE RAMS VERY
[ct=6328.358] MUCH IN THAT PICTURE IF THEY GET
[ct=6329.454] TO 8-6.
[ct=6333.135] MEANWHILE, IT BEGINS TO RAIN
[ct=6334.151] AGAIN.
[ct=6336.300] METAPHOR CAL FOR WHAT THE 49ers
[ct=6339.331] ARE FACING RIGHT NOW.
[ct=6347.348] KARTY FOR A CHIP SHOT NOW,
[ct=6350.623] 29-YARD FIELD GOAL.
[ct=6356.313] THE RAMS HAVE ENDED THEIR LAST
[ct=6359.040] THREE DRIVES WITH THREE FIELD
[ct=6359.040] GOALS.
[ct=6363.589] SO 18 SECONDS REMAIN.
[ct=6367.870] >> Kirk: BROCK PURDY, THIS
[ct=6369.122] OFFENSE OF THE 49ers, NO
[ct=6371.410] CHRISTIAN McCAFFREY AND NO
[ct=6374.190] BRANDON AIYUK AND NO TRENT
[ct=6376.959] TONIGHT 197 TOTAL YARDS.
[ct=6382.852] 197, THE SECOND FEWEST EVER
[ct=6384.307] UNDER KYLE SHANAHAN.
[ct=6387.726] 164 WHEN THEY PLAYED THE EELS IN
[ct=6388.353] THE ’22 CHAMPIONSHIP GAME WHEN
[ct=6391.748] BROCK PURDY WENT DOWN WITH THAT
[ct=6392.654] INJURY.
[ct=6394.163] >> Al: THAT WAS AGAINST THE
[ct=6394.163] PHILADELPHIA EAGLES.
[ct=6400.343] >> Kirk: BIG INTERCEPTION WAS
[ct=6402.819] HUGE.
[ct=6402.819] >> Al: WILLIAMS.
[ct=6406.418] DARIOUS WILLIAMS.
[ct=6409.109] THE RAMS HAVE TEN DAYS OFF.
[ct=6411.274] TEAMS USED TO MOAN AND GROAN
[ct=6413.532] ABOUT THURSDAY NIGHT GAMES.
[ct=6415.442] NOW WE HEAR ALMOST EVERY COACH
[ct=6415.893] SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT?
[ct=6419.560] WE LIKE IT AND YOU GET BACK TO
[ct=6421.019] WORK AND THEN TEN DAYS OFF.
[ct=6422.903] THE WHOLE THING HAS KIND OF
[ct=6423.192] FLIPPED.
[ct=6424.207] >> Kirk: I THINK IT’S A MINDSET,
[ct=6424.693] TOO.
[ct=6428.299] WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
[ct=6430.148] YOU CAN’T CHANGE IT SO TRY TO
[ct=6431.421] TAKE A POSITIVE SPIN.
[ct=6434.246] ON THE BACK END, A REWARD WHEN
[ct=6435.872] YOU WIN A FOOTBALL GAME.
[ct=6437.017] >> Al: LATE IN THE SEASON AND
[ct=6439.305] GET YOUR GUYS HEALTHIER ANY WAY.
[ct=6442.335] EVANS’ KICK.
[ct=6443.427] THEY GOING TO TAKE IT OUT FROM
[ct=6446.539] THE END ZONE HERE AND THIS IS
[ct=6450.217] SAMUEL TRYING TO BECOME A MAJOR
[ct=6452.187] HERO AND OUT TO THE 36 YARD
[ct=6457.099] FLAG COMES IN.
[ct=6459.114] YOU ALMOST NEVER SEE IT WITH A
[ct=6460.991] NEW KICKOFF RULE, THAT GUY DEEP
[ct=6465.158] IN THE END ZONE, BUT DEEBO
[ct=6466.268] THINKING, I GOT TO DO SOMETHING.
[ct=6468.746] >> Kirk: HE GETS A HORSE COLLAR
[ct=6473.274] ON TOP OF IT F15 MORE YARDS, SO
[ct=6475.119] IT PAYS OFF FOR HIM.
[ct=6479.266] >> Al: 41-YARD KICKOFF RETURN.
[ct=6482.832] >> Referee: PERSONAL FOUL, HORSE
[ct=6483.644] COLLAR TACKLE, LOS ANGELES
[ct=6484.549] NUMBER 21.
[ct=6486.653] ADD 15 YARDS TO THE ENDS OF THE
[ct=6488.288] RUN.
[ct=6490.778] >> Al: CHARLES WOOD, ROOKIE OUT
[ct=6493.400] OF SMU WITH THAT PENALTY.
[ct=6497.145] KARTY FOOLING IS LOOMING LARGE
[ct=6498.561] RIGHT NOW.
[ct=6499.545] 11 SECONDS.
[ct=6501.547] YOU CAN REALLY -- YOU KNOW, I
[ct=6502.924] THINK THE RAMS ARE GOING TO TRY
[ct=6506.300] TO PROTECT THE EDGES.
[ct=6508.034] TECHNICALLY, IF YOU HAVE A PLAY
[ct=6509.128] WHERE YOU CAN GET DOWN FIELD’
[ct=6512.439] GET OUT OF BOUNDS OR YOU GET A
[ct=6513.551] PLAY AND CAN YOU GET UP TO THE
[ct=6514.632] LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND FIRE IT
[ct=6516.001] INTO THE GROUND AND TRY TO KILL
[ct=6517.143] THE CLOCK?
[ct=6519.469] BUT THE RAMS ARE PROTECTING BOTH
[ct=6522.046] EDGES ALL THE WAY NEAR THE
[ct=6522.504] SIDELINE.
[ct=6525.631] >> Al: ONLY ONE GUY WITH HIS
[ct=6528.732] HAND DOWN SO THE NEXT TO NO RUSH
[ct=6532.060] NEXT TO NO PLAY HERE.
[ct=6532.832] >> Kirk: RAMS, TIME-OUT.
[ct=6534.045] >> Referee: TIME-OUT BY THE
[ct=6537.700] >> Al: PUT THAT ONE SECOND BACK
[ct=6540.522] ON THE CLOCK.
[ct=6542.394] >> Kirk: OF COURSE, IT CAN’T BE
[ct=6543.529] EASY, RIGHT?
[ct=6544.392] >> Al: I’M THINKING THE SAME
[ct=6545.232] THING, RIGHT?
[ct=6547.206] >> Kirk: IT CAN’T BE EASY.
[ct=6549.402] >> Al: THE OLD RINGO STARR
[ct=6550.055] THING.
[ct=6551.228] IT DON’T COME EASY.
[ct=6553.252] NO GAMES COME EASY THESE DAYS IT
[ct=6553.957] SEEMS.
[ct=6555.225] >> Kirk: WE SAW THE COMMANDERS
[ct=6557.405] BEAT THE BEARS ON A HAIL MARY.
[ct=6559.277] >> Al: OH, BOY.
[ct=6559.277] OH, BOY.
[ct=6560.634] DID WE EVER.
[ct=6561.786] >> Kirk: THAT ONE WENT VIRAL,
[ct=6563.568] DIDN’T IT?
[ct=6568.150] EVERY KANSAS CITY GAME ENDS WITH
[ct=6570.189] A NAIL-BITER AT THE END.
[ct=6571.830] >> Kirk: OH, MY GOSH.
[ct=6573.640] >> Al: HOW WILL THIS ONE GO IN
[ct=6574.378] THE BOOKS?
[ct=6576.661] BALL RIGHT AT THE 50 YARD LINE.
[ct=6579.972] SO THE RAMS HAD ONE MAN WITH HIS
[ct=6580.668] HAND DOWN.
[ct=6582.388] NOW YOU GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A
[ct=6583.554] DIFFERENT DEFENSIVE LOOK.
[ct=6587.206] >> Kirk: AND A DIFFERENT LINEUP.
[ct=6588.753] THEY HAD SPEIGHTS DOWN TO THE
[ct=6591.645] BOTTOM.
[ct=6598.410] >> Al: THREE-MAN RUSH.
[ct=6599.959] EIGHT BACK.
[ct=6602.120] TRYING TO GET IT TO PEARSALL TO
[ct=6604.423] GET OUT OF BOUNDS BUT HE CAN’T
[ct=6606.230] BUT THEY STILL HAVE SIX SECONDS
[ct=6607.516] >> Kirk: THAT IS WHAT YOU
[ct=6608.499] NEEDED.
[ct=6609.032] THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A
[ct=6610.525] WELL-DESIGNED PLAY.
[ct=6611.335] HE DIDN’T PANIC.
[ct=6611.884] HE DIDN’T RUSH.
[ct=6614.659] HE WAITED FOR PEARSALL.
[ct=6615.734] IT WAS A LONG DEVELOPING ROUTE
[ct=6617.541] AND IF HE IS ABLE TO CONNECT ON
[ct=6619.173] THAT, THAT GETS THEM DOWN TO
[ct=6621.235] INSIDE THE 35 YARD LINE.
[ct=6623.159] NOW, YOU KNOW, YOU GOT A SHOT.
[ct=6626.207] AT THIS POINT, SIX SECONDS,
[ct=6627.004] YOU’RE JUST GOING TO HAIL MARY
[ct=6630.889] OFF TO THE RIGHT HERE.
[ct=6633.433] >> Al: EXTRA RUSH.
[ct=6634.417] THEY ARE GOING TO ENDS THE GAME
[ct=6637.604] WITH A SACK!
[ct=6639.462] SO THE RAMS, INSTEAD OF SENDING
[ct=6641.222] THREE AND DROPPING EIGHT AND
[ct=6643.684] SENDING FIVE, ROZEBOOM GETS
[ct=6645.418] CREDIT FOR THE SACK.
[ct=6647.805] THE RAMS HAVE NOW WON 7 OF THEIR
[ct=6649.437] LAST 9.
[ct=6650.887] >> Kirk: A GREAT CALL BY CHRIS
[ct=6652.124] SHULA.
[ct=6653.013] SO OFTEN, LIKE YOU SAID, IT’S
[ct=6654.531] THREE AND YOU DROP EIGHT AND
[ct=6655.679] EVERYBODY IS BACK IN THE END
[ct=6658.811] INSTEAD, THEY SHOWED THREE AND
[ct=6660.705] THEN AS THE BALL IS SNAPPED,
[ct=6661.726] THOSE TWO LINEBACKERS, THEY
[ct=6665.409] DIALED UP THE HEAT.
[ct=6668.187] >> Al: TWO GUYS WITH A LONG
[ct=6671.441] HISTORY TOGETHER McVAY AND
[ct=6674.325] >> Kirk: WATCH THE LINEBACKERS.
[ct=6675.171] HERE THEY COME.
[ct=6677.673] IT’S ACTUALLY A SAFETY, KAM CURL
[ct=6680.923] WITH THE LINEBACKER ROSEBOOK AND
[ct=6681.417] THEY GET TO
[ct=6684.614] GREAT CALL.
[ct=6686.334] >> Al: SO THE RAMS, IT TOOK THEM
[ct=6688.239] FOUR DRIVES OR ALMOST THE ENTIRE
[ct=6690.127] FIRST QUARTER TO GET A FIRST
[ct=6691.886] DOWN TONIGHT.
[ct=6693.565] AND NOT THAT THE OFFENSE WAS ANY
[ct=6695.642] GREAT SHAKES FOR EITHER SIDE.
[ct=6698.386] 3-3 WAS THE HALFTIME SCORE.
[ct=6701.943] IT’S A GAME OF FIELD GOALS.
[ct=6703.965] KARTY KICKED FOUR.
[ct=6705.289] MOODY KICKS TWO.
[ct=6707.131] >> Kirk: I KNOW IT WASN’T A
[ct=6708.283] PRETTY NIGHT TONIGHT FOR THE
[ct=6709.824] RAMS BUT DON’T YOU HAVE THAT
[ct=6711.811] FEELING WITH SEAN McVAY AND
[ct=6714.267] STAFFORD AND KYREN WILLIAMS AND
[ct=6717.674] PUKA AND COOPER KUPP AND A YOUNG
[ct=6718.515] DEFENSE GETTING BETTER?
[ct=6719.992] IF THEY END UP WINNING THIS
[ct=6721.053] DIVISION, I DON’T KNOW IF I’D
[ct=6722.302] WANT TO SEE THEM ON THE OTHER
[ct=6723.371] SIDE OF A BRACKET.
[ct=6726.058] >> Al: WHATEVER IT TAKES.
[ct=6727.185] IT’S EITHER 44, 42, OR A FEW
[ct=6729.567] DAYS LATER, IT’S 12-6.
[ct=6732.357] THE NAME OF THE GAME
[ct=6732.696] EDWA IRDS,S YOU HER PMLAY
