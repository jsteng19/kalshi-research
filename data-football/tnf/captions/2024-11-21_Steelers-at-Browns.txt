[ct=4.872] UPSET WHEN OVER THE RAVENS THREE
[ct=5.667] WEEKS AGO.
[ct=6.514] CLEVELAND WINNING THE TOSS, THEY
[ct=11.370] DEFER, JUSTIN HOPKINS KICKS IT
[ct=11.370] OFF.
[ct=20.904] BACK FOR PITTSBURGH, GAME TIME
[ct=23.179] RIGHT AT THE FREEZING MARK, AND
[ct=24.469] OFF WE GO.
[ct=33.928] THE BALL IS PICKED UP, RUN BACK
[ct=40.631] BY PATTERSON, THEY PICK IT UP
[ct=41.669] AND HERE COMES WILSON.
[ct=48.548] 10 REALLY GOOD YEARS, THEN A
[ct=52.414] FORGETTABLE STAY IN DENVER.
[ct=60.010] WHEN HE GOT HEALTHY, FIELDS
[ct=61.563] STARTED THE YEAR.
[ct=66.532] >> GOOD FIT FOR RUSSELL WILSON
[ct=69.220] AND HARRIS.
[ct=74.820] AL: RIGHT OFF THE BAT SHELBY
[ct=78.140] HARRIS TAKES CARE OF NAGY HE
[ct=79.986] HARRIS, NO RELATION.
[ct=84.846] KIRK: THIS IS WHAT THE BROWNS
[ct=85.606] NEED TO DO.
[ct=90.871] DEFENSE HAS GOT TO MAKE A
[ct=91.223] DIFFERENCE TO BEAT THE STEELERS
[ct=94.857] AND GET SHORT FIELDS.
[ct=101.679] JIM SCHWARTZ HAS AN AGGRESSIVE
[ct=101.928] APPROACH.
[ct=108.412] AL: IN THE BACKFIELD, HARRIS
[ct=108.601] STARTS.
[ct=110.832] SECOND AND ONE.
[ct=121.421] AGAIN, A HECK OF A YEAR, YOU'VE
[ct=121.980] GOT HARRIS IN THE BACKGROUND,
[ct=124.060] DON'T OVERLOOK THIS KID.
[ct=130.730] >> WATCHED HIM COME OVER, TAKE
[ct=135.273] HIM OUT AND GO DOWNHILL.
[ct=142.174] THAT IS THE CHANGE OF PACE.
[ct=145.809] SECOND OR THIRD
[ct=147.286] DEFENSE.
[ct=151.936] AL: HARRIS COMES IN, QUICK
[ct=151.936] THROW.
[ct=161.287] DARNELL WASHINGTON, BIG, THEY'RE
[ct=163.947] GOING TO TRY TO WORK HIM INTO
[ct=163.947] THE PASSING GAME.
[ct=170.883] >> AT GEORGIA, BROCK BOWERS WAS
[ct=177.546] GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION AND
[ct=178.709] WE THOUGHT HE LOOKED LIKE A
[ct=182.664] TACKLE BUT GREAT BLOCKER.
[ct=185.116] IMPROVING AS A RECEIVER.
[ct=195.124] AL THE PAST IS CAUGHT, A TACKLE
[ct=197.802] SETTING UP THE FIRST THIRD DOWN.
[ct=204.204] KIRK: THEY WANT WILSON TO RUN
[ct=207.663] THE FOOTBALL, GET IT OUT OF HIS
[ct=211.919] HANDS AND HANDED OFF TO JUSTIN
[ct=211.919] FIELDS.
[ct=220.438] AL: THERE IS, FIELDS COMES IN,
[ct=221.325] SPECIAL PACKAGE FOR HIM.
[ct=225.852] MAKING A THROW IF NEED BE.
[ct=229.001] THIRD AND ONE.
[ct=235.686] BRAD ALLEN, THE REFEREE.
[ct=243.472] THAT IS WASHINGTON AND FIELDS
[ct=244.645] CAN COME OUT AND THEN WILSON
[ct=244.645] WILL COME BACK IN.
[ct=252.105] KIRK: THE RHYTHM AND THE
[ct=254.121] CADENCE, ONE QUARTERBACK TO THE
[ct=258.071] NEXT AT THE BOTTOM, JUST A SMALL
[ct=258.642] LITTLE THING.
[ct=262.061] THAT IS THE RISK YOU TAKE.
[ct=267.393] AL: YOU WOULD THINK STEELERS
[ct=270.181] FANS MIGHT OUTNUMBER THE BROWNS
[ct=272.862] FANS, THAT IS NOT THE CASE.
[ct=275.368] THE PASS IS CAUGHT.
[ct=280.630] PAT FREIERMUTH AND STEELERS FANS
[ct=281.971] WHO MADE THE TRIP.
[ct=288.626] KIRK: IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF
[ct=292.624] HIS SKILL SET, ABLE TO SEPARATE
[ct=297.946] FROM BRAD, WELL DESIGNED PLAY,
[ct=300.893] THIRD DOWN AFTER THE PENALTY.
[ct=305.772] AL: MORAN IS THE RUNNING BACK.
[ct=309.757] GOOD RUN AGAIN.
[ct=314.344] TAKEN DOWN, THORNHILL PICKS UP
[ct=316.603] SIX AND THE GAME IS OPEN FOR
[ct=318.021] PITTSBURGH.
[ct=324.870] KIRK: SMITH WAS A PERFECT FIT.
[ct=330.056] YOU THINK WHO WOULD FIT AND
[ct=332.974] REMEMBER THAT CANADA YEARS, DID
[ct=336.504] NOT FIT WITH MIKE TOMLIN AND
[ct=338.547] THEY FOUND THAT WITH SMITH.
[ct=342.170] WE SAW DERRICK HENRY, WITH THE
[ct=342.170] TITANS.
[ct=345.428] NOW HE FITS.
[ct=351.190] AL: FLURRIES KEEPING IT, WILSON
[ct=355.381] TAKEN DOWN, FOUR AND A HALF
[ct=355.381] MINUTES INTO THE GAME.
[ct=360.996] RUSSELL WILSON, MIKE TOMLIN OF
[ct=363.698] COURSE, WHEN HE GOT THE JOB HE
[ct=365.850] WAS 34, WINNING THE SUPER BOWL
[ct=370.197] HIS SECOND YEAR, GOT THERE AGAIN
[ct=371.364] IN HIS FOURTH YEAR, ROLLING
[ct=371.364] ALONG.
[ct=374.957] KIRK: INCREDIBLE.
[ct=380.903] IT IS SO HARD TO SUSTAIN
[ct=381.056] EXCELLENCE THE WAY HE HAS.
[ct=386.690] >> WILSON UNDER PRESSURE, MYLES
[ct=390.893] GARRETT LOVES TO HEAR IT FROM
[ct=390.893] THE CROWD AND HE WILL.
[ct=398.276] SEVEN SACKS, FOURTH AND 11.
[ct=400.780] KIRK: GREAT MATCHUP.
[ct=405.408] CHIP INITIALLY BUT NOT TO SLOW
[ct=408.834] DOWN A MYLES GARRETT, GREAT
[ct=410.510] COVERAGE ALLOWS HIM TO GET THE
[ct=415.688] SACK, RUSSELL WILSON HOLDS THE
[ct=417.460] FOOTBALL, A DANGEROUS THING TO
[ct=417.887] DO.
[ct=425.351] AL: 58 YARDS, THE ONE HE MISSED
[ct=428.855] WAS FROM 62.
[ct=433.466] WYATT TO THE RIGHT SO HE MISSES
[ct=438.241] KIRK: THERE IT IS.
[ct=441.093] AL: INCOMPLETE.
[ct=446.752] FIRST PLAY IS A PASS TO THE
[ct=449.074] OUTSIDE AND WE WERE WONDERING
[ct=450.002] HOW MUCH PASSING YOU COULD SEE.
[ct=457.492] KIRK: WE EXPECTED RAIN AND IT
[ct=461.430] TURNED DID TO -- TURNED INTO
[ct=461.430] SNOW SHOWERS.
[ct=465.903] WE JUST KNOW IT IS COLD.
[ct=469.560] AL: HANDOFF WILL GO TO NICK
[ct=471.678] CHUBB.
[ct=479.035] SLUNG BACK AND THE CROWD ONCE A
[ct=480.043] FLAG.
[ct=484.543] THE ROOKIE MADE A PHENOMENAL
[ct=487.041] INTERCEPTION BUT NOTHING
[ct=488.260] HAPPENED AND ON WE GO.
[ct=495.501] KIRK: CHALLENGING YEAR, AFTER
[ct=497.735] TONIGHT EIGHT DIFFERENT OFFENSES
[ct=504.126] AND THE MOST IN THE NFL, WATSON,
[ct=506.256] WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT.
[ct=510.922] MANY MISSED CUES AND THERE'S
[ct=512.814] ANOTHER ONE.
[ct=518.832] REFEREE: FALSE START, OFFENSE.
[ct=521.073] THIRD DOWN.
[ct=524.701] AL: THAT'S ONE GUY YOU CAN
[ct=526.373] REALLY COUNT ON, HE'S BEEN
[ct=526.373] GREAT.
[ct=531.972] KIRK: INTERIOR HAS BEEN HIS
[ct=536.791] STRENGTH, IT'S JUST BEEN REALLY
[ct=539.989] AT THE EDGES, TRYING TO STAY
[ct=545.100] HEALTHY, CONTINUITY, WITHOUT IT
[ct=546.634] IT'S TOUGH TO DO ANYTHING.
[ct=553.216] AL: INTO STEELER TERRITORY,
[ct=554.375] TAKEN DOWN SHY OF THE FIRST
[ct=554.375] DOWN.
[ct=561.188] THE BROWNS ARE LAST IN THIRD
[ct=562.427] DOWN CONVERSIONS.
[ct=567.533] YOU LOOK AT THE GUY WHO PONCE --
[ct=574.341] PUNTS, DESCENDED DOWN TOWARD
[ct=575.530] CALVIN AUSTIN.
[ct=581.141] WHAT IS THAT?
[ct=585.371] THE FLAG IS DOWN, WHATEVER THAT
[ct=587.421] WAS.
[ct=589.594] TO THE WIND MOVE IT?
[ct=594.687] KIRK: THE GUNNER ENDED UP ALMOST
[ct=596.137] IN THE THIRD ROW, THAT'S WHERE
[ct=598.144] THE FLAG CAME IN.
[ct=603.454] AL: THE KICKER WAS 10 OR 12
[ct=610.190] YARDS, THE BROWNS ARE GOING BACK
[ct=612.293] TO THE BENCH, WE WILL SEE WHAT
[ct=613.657] THE PENALTY IS.
[ct=618.353] KIRK: DEEP INTO THE BENCH,
[ct=623.737] BISHOP PUSHED AND PUSHED BEYOND
[ct=625.000] THE BENCH.
[ct=638.927] >> 15 YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN.
[ct=649.300] AL: CARRIE MCCULLY PUT ON A COAT
[ct=649.300] THIS WAY.
[ct=653.343] KIRK: IT'S ILLEGAL TO BLOCK THE
[ct=653.343] GUNNER OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=658.043] ONCE WE WATCH THE CLEVELAND
[ct=659.349] PLAYER PULLS HIM ALL THE WAY
[ct=659.349] INTO THE PICTURE HE.
[ct=660.381] IS HE BLOCKING OR IS HE PULLED
[ct=661.695] IN?
[ct=664.601] I COULD MAKE A CASE THAT IT WAS
[ct=666.009] MORE OF A PULLED INTO AS OPPOSED
[ct=667.164] TO A BLOCK.
[ct=668.295] AL: MAY HAVE BEEN ANOTHER FLAG.
[ct=670.918] FALSE START ON PITTSBURGH.
[ct=673.380] THE PUNT WENT 12 YARDS.
[ct=680.603] THAT FALSE START IS ON CO
[ct=681.916] HIS BROTHER PLAYS ON THE OTHER
[ct=681.916] SIDE OF THE BALL.
[ct=688.151] KIRK: BOTH OF THESE OFFENSES ARE
[ct=689.442] SLOW TO SETTLE INTO THE RAIN.
[ct=693.886] ANOTHER FLINCH BY PITTSBURGH.
[ct=695.756] SAW WASHINGTON EARLIER.
[ct=696.808] NOW IT'S HAYWARD.
[ct=700.954] AL: FIRST AND 15.
[ct=703.471] CALVIN AUSTIN ON THE MOVE.
[ct=706.554] INTO THE OUTSIDE WITH ROOM TO
[ct=707.856] RUN.
[ct=709.252] STIFF ARM THERE.
[ct=710.542] HARRIS BEHIND ISAAC SEUMALO.
[ct=717.845] SECOND DOWN AND 4.
[ct=720.795] KIRK: WE TALKED ABOUT THE FIT OF
[ct=720.795] ARTHUR SMITH.
[ct=722.582] GOING OUT AND BRINGING THREE
[ct=725.768] ROOKIES TO ALMOST RESET THIS
[ct=728.247] TEAM AND THIS ROSTER.
[ct=728.247] I THINK IT WAS INTENTIONAL TO GO
[ct=732.684] OUT AND ESTABLISHES HER --
[ct=733.649] ESTABLISH A CERTAIN TOUGHNESS.
[ct=737.802] MCCORMICK AT RIGHT GUARD.
[ct=737.802] BOTH THESE GUYS, ROOKIE.
[ct=742.108] AL: SHORT DROP.
[ct=742.108] RUSSELL DOESN’
[ct=742.407] RUSSELL DOESN'T LIKE WHAT HE
[ct=742.407] SEES.
[ct=747.362] HE GETS PUSHED OUT OF BOUNDS BY
[ct=747.362] JORDAN HICKS.
[ct=749.348] THAT WILL MAKE IT THIRD DOWN AND
[ct=753.162] 6 AFTER A LOSS OF 2.
[ct=757.463] KIRK: IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
[ct=759.817] RUSSELL WILSON PLAY, HE IS 4-0.
[ct=759.817] WONDERING WHAT HE'S DOING RIGHT.
[ct=763.420] I THINK WHAT HE'S DOING RIGHT,
[ct=765.536] WE SAW IT IN THE FIRST DRIVE.
[ct=765.536] WHEN HE'S PLAYING IN A QUICK
[ct=769.552] GAME AND HE'S MAKING QUICK
[ct=773.017] DECISIONS, ALONG WITH THE
[ct=774.297] RUNNING GAME, THAT'S WHERE THEY
[ct=774.297] WANT TO LIVE.
[ct=776.989] THAT STRAIGHT DROP BACK WHERE HE
[ct=778.831] STARTS TO CREATE AND GO BACK TO
[ct=778.831] HIS SEATTLE DAYS.
[ct=781.000] HE JUST DOESN'T HAVE THAT IN HIM
[ct=783.232] IN HIS OFFENSE.
[ct=785.742] AL: THIRD DOWN AND 6.
[ct=788.589] GOING DEEP DOWN.
[ct=788.589] IT'S CAUGHT.
[ct=791.369] PICKENS COVERING WELL.
[ct=793.764] ONE OF THE TOP CORNERS IN THE
[ct=796.871] LEAGUE GOING UP AGAINST PICKENS.
[ct=797.934] PICKENS WINS THAT BATTLE.
[ct=799.373] THIRD AND 6.
[ct=801.924] THEY PICK UP 32.
[ct=803.180] KIRK: HE WENT TO THE IN
[ct=804.401] ROUTE.
[ct=805.692] THIS TIME HE OPTS TO GO
[ct=806.979] DOWNFIELD.
[ct=809.308] GREAT SEPARATION AT THE END.
[ct=811.177] DENZEL WARD NEVER ABLE TO LOCATE
[ct=812.585] THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=813.735] WHAT A JOB.
[ct=816.085] NICE THROW TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE
[ct=817.435] AND A HECKUVA JOB OF FOCUSING ON
[ct=819.460] THE FOOTBALL THERE BY PICKENS.
[ct=824.393] AL: TO THE GROUND.
[ct=824.741] TO THE LEFT SIDE.
[ct=830.157] KIRK: PICKENS WILL USE EVERY
[ct=831.424] OUNCE OF HIS BODY.
[ct=835.233] THE LEFT LEG, THE RIGHT KNEE.
[ct=838.281] EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO SECURE
[ct=839.408] THE FOOTBALL AND IT NEVER
[ct=839.408] TOUCHES THE GROUND.
[ct=849.277] AL: WE'VE CAPABLE.
[ct=853.083] DEVELOPING MORE CONSISTENCY THIS
[ct=853.083] YEAR.
[ct=856.360] HARRIS IS BACK IN THERE.
[ct=858.292] SECOND DOWN AND 6.
[ct=863.955] HARRIS.
[ct=866.839] HE'S AS DURABLE AS THEY COME.
[ct=868.148] HE STARTED HIS FIRST GAME AS A
[ct=868.148] ROOKIE.
[ct=872.510] HE HASN'T MISSED A SINGLE START
[ct=873.060] SINCE HE SIGNED AS THE NUMBER
[ct=874.226] ONE PICK BACK IN 21.
[ct=876.604] KIRK: THERE'S A LOT TO LIKE
[ct=878.754] ABOUT THAT.
[ct=879.891] HE WILL ONLY GET BETTER AND
[ct=879.891] BETTER.
[ct=881.057] I LOVE HOW THEY CONTINUE TO
[ct=882.272] REFEREE -- ROTATE HIM.
[ct=885.709] GOT TO GIVE JIM SCHWARTZ CREDIT.
[ct=889.097] PITTSBURGH WANTS TO RUN TH
[ct=890.551] THEY WILL TRY TO OCCASIONALLY
[ct=893.147] GET YOU ON SOME PLAY ACTION ON
[ct=893.147] EARLY DOWNS.
[ct=896.270] HE IS SENDING HIS DEFENSIVE LINE
[ct=896.270] LOSE.
[ct=898.587] HE WANTS THEM TO PENETRATE AND
[ct=898.587] CREATE THOSE NEGATIVE PLAYS.
[ct=907.928] AL: FEEL THERE'S ALREADY 2-3
[ct=909.395] NOT THIS TIME THOUGH.
[ct=911.839] 38.
[ct=911.839] VAN JEFFERSON.
[ct=915.093] TACKLED BY RONNIE.
[ct=917.478] NOW ROB TOMLIN ON FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=921.523] LOOKS LIKE A SHORT TWO.
[ct=921.523] TAKE YOUR PICK.
[ct=926.433] KIRK: HE WILL BRING FIELDS OUT.
[ct=929.584] WITH FIELDS OUT, IT'S NOT JUST
[ct=929.828] THE QUARTERBACK RUNNING IT.
[ct=932.581] THERE'S THE POSSIBILITY OF ZONE
[ct=933.990] READ WHERE HE CAN READ OFF THE
[ct=936.548] END MAN, GIVE IT OR PULL IT.
[ct=938.104] THEY COULD RUN QUARTERBACK
[ct=939.406] THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT
[ct=939.406] THINGS.
[ct=942.771] HE'S GOING TO RUN AND THEN
[ct=942.771] POLLITT IT AND THROW IT.
[ct=944.510] A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS OPEN
[ct=947.205] UP WIN TWO RUNS OUT THERE.
[ct=951.694] AL: THEY SENT PATTERSON ALL THE
[ct=951.694] WAY TO THE LEFT.
[ct=952.855] FIELDS LOOKING FOR ROOM.
[ct=954.130] WON'T FIND IT.
[ct=960.476] GOOD GAME.
[ct=963.371] HE DOES IT AGAIN.
[ct=968.910] TURNOVER ON DOWNS.
[ct=970.148] CAME BACK WEEK ONE.
[ct=971.387] THE TOWN IS SO EXCITED.
[ct=975.332] FINAL SCORE 0-33.
[ct=977.993] KIRK: OUCH.
[ct=982.104] AL: HERE WE ARE.
[ct=984.915] LOOKING FOR ROOM.
[ct=987.028] FINDING SOME.
[ct=987.028] BREAKING TACKLES GOES NICK JOE.
[ct=990.480] KIRK: LET'S GO BACK TO THAT
[ct=990.480] FOURTH DOWN RUN.
[ct=993.561] IT ALMOST LOOKED LIKE WHAT A
[ct=996.015] PULLING GUARD IS TRYING TO GET
[ct=997.230] SOMETHING IN HERE AND THEN HE
[ct=998.712] ENDS UP PULLING TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=1000.067] YOU'VE GOT MYLES GARRETT WHO
[ct=1002.960] ENDS UP TAKING AWAY THE EDGE.
[ct=1004.406] THEN YOU'VE GOT GRANT DELPIT WHO
[ct=1006.366] IS DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB THERE
[ct=1007.557] MAKING SURE HE CAN'T BOUNCE INTO
[ct=1008.723] THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=1008.723] THERE'S GARRETT.
[ct=1013.117] JUST NOWHERE TO GO.
[ct=1013.117] GIVE THE DEFENSE A LOT OF
[ct=1014.064] CREDIT.
[ct=1015.600] ANOTHER BIG STOP THERE.
[ct=1019.924] AL: INSIDE OF THREE MINUTES TO
[ct=1019.924] GO IN THE CORRIDOR.
[ct=1022.507] SHOVE AGAIN.
[ct=1026.805] OVER A YEAR OFF AGAINST
[ct=1030.096] HE GOT HURT.
[ct=1032.130] HE'D ALREADY HAD MAJOR SURGERY
[ct=1032.130] IN GEORGIA YEARS AND YEARS AGO.
[ct=1035.132] HE GOT BACK A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.
[ct=1037.702] LET'S HOPE HE’S FULLY RECOVERED.
[ct=1040.255] HE IS SOME KIND OF PLAYER.
[ct=1042.928] KIRK: REALLY IS.
[ct=1044.809] WHEN HE'S HEALTHY, HE’S AS GOOD
[ct=1044.809] AS THE LEAGUE HAS TO OFFER.
[ct=1048.638] THAT INJURY HE HAD IN COLLEGE,
[ct=1048.638] IT WAS DEVASTATING.
[ct=1049.852] HE RECOVERED.
[ct=1052.303] YOU HOPE THE SAME
[ct=1053.553] AFTER THIS INJURY AS WELL.
[ct=1056.568] AL: 32.
[ct=1056.568] OFF-BALANCE.
[ct=1059.142] INCOMPLETE.
[ct=1060.379] INTENDED FOR CEDRIC TILLMAN.
[ct=1065.908] SO ONCE AGAIN, THE BROWNS, LAST
[ct=1066.892] IN THE LEAGUE
[ct=1068.107] CONVERSIONS.
[ct=1069.256] THEY ARE 0-2 SO FAR TONIGHT.
[ct=1073.609] KIRK: LOOK AT THESE EDGE RUSHERS
[ct=1074.712] THERE.
[ct=1076.079] HE'S GOT ENOUGH TIME.
[ct=1078.607] WHEN HE STEPPED UP, HE COLLIDES
[ct=1079.871] WITH THE GUARD.
[ct=1082.406] GOT OFF-BALANCE.
[ct=1082.406] COULDN'T COM
[ct=1084.251] ACCURATE THROW.
[ct=1086.724] AL: THE FIRST BOND WAS 12 YARDS.
[ct=1089.125] THIS IS A LITTLE BIT BETTER.
[ct=1093.056] NICE LITTLE BOUNCE TO ALLOW
[ct=1094.788] CLEVELAND TO DOWN IT IN THE 10
[ct=1104.805] AL: BACK WE COME HERE 2:01 TO GO
[ct=1106.537] IN THE OPENING QUARTER.
[ct=1108.985] WILSON CHECKING OUT THE PLAY.
[ct=1114.375] KIRK: THE BROWNS COULDN'T HAVE
[ct=1115.541] ASKED FOR BETTER STARTING FIELD
[ct=1115.541] POSITION.
[ct=1116.754] THEY ARE RIGHT AROUND MIDFIELD.
[ct=1125.074] AL: PITTSBURGH STOP THIS FIELD
[ct=1127.705] GOAL AND THEN TURNED IT OVER ON
[ct=1135.507] KIRK: THE STORY IS GOING TO
[ct=1136.690] CONTINUE TO BE BOTH
[ct=1138.343] OFFENSES BEING ABLE TO RUN THE
[ct=1139.318] FOOTBALL.
[ct=1142.270] YOU CAN SEE THE PENALTIES FOR
[ct=1143.361] THE STEELERS TONIGHT.
[ct=1144.592] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1146.895] OFF TO A SLOW START HERE.
[ct=1149.531] PITTSBURGH RUNNING THE FOOTBALL
[ct=1149.531] TO SET UP THEIR PLAY-ACTION.
[ct=1157.981] WARD.
[ct=1160.854] AL: SECOND AND 6.
[ct=1163.355] GARRETT ON THE SIDELINES FOR
[ct=1163.355] THIS PLAY.
[ct=1166.510] ROLLING, THROWING.
[ct=1166.510] SHORT THROW.
[ct=1168.853] AGAIN OF ABOUT THREE THAT TIME.
[ct=1177.014] KIRK: STEELERS RECEIVER VAN
[ct=1178.616] JEFFERSON, WE JUST LEARNED HE
[ct=1179.883] QUESTIONABLE TO RETURN BECAUSE
[ct=1181.148] OF A QUAD INJURY.
[ct=1183.764] HE WAS ON THE INJURY REPORT LAST
[ct=1183.764] WEEK WITH THAT QUAD.
[ct=1186.278] PLAYED THROUGH IT.
[ct=1186.278] NOW IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BOTHERING
[ct=1187.572] HIM.
[ct=1188.537] HE JUST GOT OFF THE EXE
[ct=1190.457] BIKE.
[ct=1191.945] AL: PROBABLY MEANS MORE ACTION
[ct=1193.267] FOR MIKE WILLIAMS PERHAPS.
[ct=1195.715] THIRD DOWN AND 2.
[ct=1198.370] THE STEELERS HAVE A STREAK GOING
[ct=1198.370] THAT'S IN JEOPARDY.
[ct=1200.798] THEY HAVE SCORED IN EACH OF THE
[ct=1202.438] LAST 20 TWO QUARTERS.
[ct=1203.677] 5.5 GAMES.
[ct=1208.802] THAT PASS IS PULLED IN AT THE 27
[ct=1208.802] YARD LINE.
[ct=1212.939] PICKENS WITH WARD WHICH WOULD BE
[ct=1214.378] A GOOD BATTLE TONIGHT.
[ct=1216.693] KIRK: THE POSITION
[ct=1220.940] IT ALLOWS PICKENS TO SHORT --
[ct=1220.940] FIELD WARD.
[ct=1222.529] WHEN HE'S ON, THE
[ct=1224.014] QUICKLY.
[ct=1225.370] WARD GETS THERE A LITTLE
[ct=1225.370] BITTERLY.
[ct=1229.337] HE IS NOW 7-7 TO GET THE GAME
[ct=1229.337] STARTED.
[ct=1233.257] RUSSELL WILSON FOR 77 YARDS.
[ct=1234.300] PRETTY GOOD START.
[ct=1240.753] AL: ANYWAY.
[ct=1243.649] FIRST AND 10.
[ct=1247.859] KIRK:MAHOMES, CHIEFS, RAIDERS ON
[ct=1249.215] BLACK FRIDAY.
[ct=1253.205] FIRST DOWN FOR PITTSBURGH HERE.
[ct=1254.953] START ON THE GROUND HERE.
[ct=1260.522] WARREN TAKEN DOWN AT THE LINE OF
[ct=1260.829] SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=1265.459] MIKE VRABEL HAD BEEN IN
[ct=1266.050] TENNESSEE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.
[ct=1268.801] FIRED AT THE END OF LAST SEASON.
[ct=1270.194] PEOPLE THOUGHT HE MIGHT GET A
[ct=1271.200] HEAD COACHING JOB.
[ct=1271.851] HE DIDN'T.
[ct=1273.799] HE'S OUT THERE ON THE STREET IN
[ct=1274.159] A MANNER OF SPEAKING.
[ct=1276.491] GOING SKIING OR WHATEVER HE
[ct=1277.058] WANTED.
[ct=1279.513] CALLED HIM AND SAYS,, ON OVER.
[ct=1282.087] HELP ME OUT HERE.
[ct=1286.015] GET ME A LITTLE TUTELAGE
[ct=1287.653] NOW HE'S ON THE SIDELINES
[ct=1287.653] TONIGHT.
[ct=1290.043] KIRK: STARTED OFF.
[ct=1291.235] WASN'T GOING TO COME OFF TOO
[ct=1291.235] MUCH.
[ct=1295.598] EACH WEEK HE GETS A LITTLE BIT
[ct=1295.598] MORE INVOLVED.
[ct=1300.083] AL: THIS IS WARREN AGAIN.
[ct=1301.914] YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE FANS
[ct=1307.497] HE'S BEEN TO THE PLAYOFFS TWICE.
[ct=1309.998] A TON OF QUARTERBACKS.
[ct=1312.641] YOU BRING A GUY IN AND THE FAN
[ct=1315.215] BASE STARTS TO GO, MAYBE WE
[ct=1315.215] SHOULD GET THIS
[ct=1316.754] COACH.
[ct=1319.146] KIRK: WHEN I LEARNED MIKE VRABEL
[ct=1320.374] WAS A GOOD COACH, HE JUST GOT
[ct=1323.348] DONE WINNING THE SUPER BOWL.
[ct=1329.146] HE COACHED KINDERGARTEN FOOTBALL
[ct=1331.500] AND HE TALKED TO THEM THE WAY HE
[ct=1331.500] TALKS TO THE BROWNS PLAYERS.
[ct=1335.817] I WAS LIKE, THAT GUY
[ct=1337.032] BE A GREAT COACH.
[ct=1339.292] IN THIS POLITICALLY CORRECT
[ct=1340.606] STYLE OF COACHING, THAT GUY IS A
[ct=1342.445] FOOTBALL COACH EVEN WITH KIDS.
[ct=1343.908] AL: GETTING OPEN.
[ct=1346.048] FREE IS CALVIN AUSTIN.
[ct=1348.982] GREAT SPEED AND HE SHOWS THAT
[ct=1351.638] TAKES IT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO
[ct=1352.964] 25 YARD LINE.
[ct=1355.445] CALVIN AUSTIN ON A 48 YARD BOMB.
[ct=1358.047] KIRK: THAT'S WHAT HE CAN DO.
[ct=1360.125] GREAT JOB OF BEING ABLE TO
[ct=1360.125] ATTACK THE SAFETY.
[ct=1362.442] HE COMPLAINED AND COMMAND
[ct=1363.522] COVERAGE.
[ct=1364.817] HIS EYES GOT MESSED UP.
[ct=1366.415] HE LOOKED TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=1368.681] WITH AUSTIN SPEED, HE IS ABLE TO
[ct=1371.337] GET AROUND HIM AND COME CLOSE TO
[ct=1372.670] GETTING THAT PRESSURE
[ct=1373.971] WILSON.
[ct=1375.309] THAT'S A WELL-DESIGNED PLAY AND
[ct=1376.637] A GREAT JOB BY RUSSELL WILSON,
[ct=1378.319] FINDING THE MATCHUP A
[ct=1379.501] SAFETY.
[ct=1382.166] AL: 4-3-2 AT THE COMBINE SO HE'S
[ct=1383.906] A JET.
[ct=1386.165] HAMMERING BREAKING TACKLES.
[ct=1390.044] THE BALL IS OUT.
[ct=1391.370] WILSON IS THERE.
[ct=1392.747] RUSSELL WILSON IS ABLE TO SECURE
[ct=1393.788] IT.
[ct=1395.295] HARRIS FIGHTING AND
[ct=1396.614] IT'S HIS FIRST FUMBLE OF THE
[ct=1397.522] SEASON.
[ct=1401.148] THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER, HE RE
[ct=1403.112] FUMBLES.
[ct=1405.252] OUT.
[ct=1407.898] IF YOU GO BACK TO EARLIER, YOU
[ct=1407.898] CAN SEE RUSSELL WILSON STANDING
[ct=1410.423] THERE JUST IN CASE THE BALL CAME
[ct=1413.399] HE WAS WATCHING HIM AND WATCHING
[ct=1414.069] HIM AND WATCHING HIM AND WAITING
[ct=1416.526] FOR THE THREAT.
[ct=1416.526] LOOK AT HIM STANDING THERE JUST
[ct=1419.059] IN CASE THE BALL GETS POPPED
[ct=1425.867] AL: SECOND DOWN AND 13 NOW.
[ct=1432.750] PITTSBURGH WILL TAKE A
[ct=1434.041] 30 SECOND TIMEOUT.
[ct=1437.059] KIRK: LET'S REMEMBER THAT PLAY
[ct=1438.241] THE GREAT THROW BY RUSSELL
[ct=1441.979] JUST THAT VETERAN LEADERSHIP.
[ct=1443.186] JUST IN CASE THERE'S A FUMBLE BY
[ct=1447.117] IF HE'S NOT THERE, EVEN PAYING
[ct=1448.482] ATTENTION, IT'S A FUMBLE AND
[ct=1451.680] IT'S A BROWNS FOOTBALL.
[ct=1456.300] >> NOT SHE HARRIS TOLD ME
[ct=1457.540] RUSSELL WILSON WAS THE VETERAN
[ct=1457.714] THAT THIS TEAM NEEDED.
[ct=1460.377] HE SAID THE PAST TWO YEARS, THE
[ct=1460.377] STEELERS HAVE BEEN A YOUNG TEAM.
[ct=1464.717] EVEN HE WAS IN THE
[ct=1466.071] THIRD YEAR.
[ct=1466.890] HE FELT GUYS WERE LOOKING UP TO
[ct=1469.841] HE BELIEVES THEY HAVE THE ONE UP
[ct=1471.059] EACH WEEK BECAUSE OF WILSON AND
[ct=1472.668] HIS KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC
[ct=1473.907] TENDENCIES OF PLAYERS, COACHES,
[ct=1475.144] AND SCHEMES.
[ct=1476.406] YOU SAW IT AT WORK.
[ct=1479.011] AL: HE'S BEEN REJUVENATED
[ct=1479.011] HIMSELF.
[ct=1483.329] NOT THAT HE LOST CONFIDENCE.
[ct=1484.114] HE IS ALWAYS A CONFIDENT GUY.
[ct=1485.636] THOSE TWO YEARS IN DENVER, WOW.
[ct=1488.106] KIRK: OH YEAH.
[ct=1490.785] AL: SECOND DOWN AND 13.
[ct=1494.605] OFF THE FAKE AND HE THROWS IT TO
[ct=1497.749] THE FLAG IS THROWN.
[ct=1501.314] HARRIS GETS SPILLED AT THE 27.
[ct=1501.314] WE WILL HEAR FROM BRAD ALLEN
[ct=1514.465] -- NEXT.
[ct=1517.683] >> THE ILLEGAL FORMATION.
[ct=1520.148] OFFENSE NUMBER 83 WAS COVERING
[ct=1521.419] NUMBER 80.
[ct=1522.719] PENALTY IS DECLINED.
[ct=1528.072] AL: HAYWARD COVERING WASHINGTON.
[ct=1529.274] THIRD DOWN AND 10 NOW.
[ct=1531.586] KIRK: THIS IS AN AREA THAT
[ct=1534.344] PITTSBURGH IS TRYING TO COME UP
[ct=1534.344] WITH ANSWERS.
[ct=1535.344] NOT JUST RED ZONE.
[ct=1539.674] THEY MOVE THE BALL PRETTY
[ct=1539.674] CONSISTENTLY WITH RUSSELL WILSON
[ct=1542.083] IN THERE.
[ct=1544.534] THE CLOSER THEY GET DOWN INTO
[ct=1544.534] THE RED ZONE, THEY WILL GET MORE
[ct=1546.897] CHALLENGES TO BE ABLE TO
[ct=1548.251] OFF DRIVES.
[ct=1551.433] THAT'S RIGHT WAS WELL -- ROZ
[ct=1555.023] AL: 29 IN FACT.
[ct=1556.214] MOST IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=1559.500] THIRD DOWN AND 10.
[ct=1566.717] PRESSURE.
[ct=1568.181] BATTED AWAY.
[ct=1572.545] TRYING TO WORK HIS WAY FOR EXTRA
[ct=1572.545] YARDAGE.
[ct=1577.311] WARREN TAKES IT TO THE 24.
[ct=1581.104] BOSWELL MR. EARLIER FROM 58.
[ct=1583.843] ONLY HIS SECOND MISS OF THE
[ct=1588.654] TWICE THIS SEASON, BOSWELL, THE
[ct=1588.654] WIND IS WHIPPING.
[ct=1591.786] IF ANYTHING, IT'S GOING INTO THE
[ct=1591.786] WIND.
[ct=1596.881] SIX FIELD GOALS LAST WEEK.
[ct=1598.295] THEY DIDN'T SCORE A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=1598.295] ONE THE GAME.
[ct=1601.361] SIX TOUCHDOWNS AGAINST ATLANTA
[ct=1602.773] EARLIER IN THE SEASON.
[ct=1605.086] THIS WILL PUT THE FIRST -- BUT
[ct=1606.378] THE FIRST POINTS OF THE GAME ON
[ct=1606.378] THE SCOREBOARD.
[ct=1611.154] LOOKING GOOD.
[ct=1613.716] KIRK: MOVEMENT ON THE LEFT SIDE
[ct=1615.049] OF THE LINE TO PUSH IT BACK FIVE
[ct=1615.049] MORE YARDS.
[ct=1621.244] >> FALSE START, OFFENSE,
[ct=1622.901] 97.
[ct=1625.573] KIRK: WHEN YOU ARE PITTSBURGH
[ct=1625.573] AND YOUR MARGIN OF ERROR IS SO
[ct=1628.460] SMALL BECAUSE YOU ARE WINNING
[ct=1631.566] WITH DEFENSE AND SPECIAL TEAMS,
[ct=1634.019] WHEN YOU ARE WINNING LIKE THAT,
[ct=1635.279] YOU ARE ON THE ROAD ON A SHORT
[ct=1635.279] WEEK.
[ct=1636.776] YOU'VE GOT TO PLAY CLEAN.
[ct=1639.702] THEY HAVEN'T DONE THAT IN THE
[ct=1641.094] FIRST HALF.
[ct=1643.040] AL: HE'S AN EASY PLAYING THREE
[ct=1649.765] 31 DEGREES.
[ct=1652.087] 48 YARD FIELD GOAL.
[ct=1656.055] BOSWELL.
[ct=1657.143] THAT KICK IS GOOD.
[ct=1659.524] INSIDE THE RIGHT UPRIGHT.
[ct=1663.370] 30TH OF THE SEASON.
[ct=1663.370] HE LEADS THE LEAGUE IN POINTS.
[ct=1666.543] 3-0 PITTSBURGH.
[ct=1672.252] NOT GOING AGAINST EACH OTHER.
[ct=1674.751] THERE'S A LOT OF PRIDE ON THE
[ct=1674.751] LINE.
[ct=1677.580] DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR FOR
[ct=1678.726] T.J. WATT LAST YEAR.
[ct=1683.068] MYLES GARRETT.
[ct=1684.315] 104 SACKS.
[ct=1685.661] GARRETT, NUMBER FIVE.
[ct=1686.956] JUST TREMENDOUS TO WATCH.
[ct=1689.344] THEY DO IT IN SUCH DIFFERENT
[ct=1689.344] WAYS.
[ct=1696.589] AL: THAT WILL BE A TOUCHBACK AS
[ct=1699.188] THE BALL WAS TAKEN OUTSIDE THE
[ct=1701.094] ONE AND THEN FORD HAD TO PICK IT
[ct=1701.094] UP IN THE END ZONE.
[ct=1705.120] DOWNS IT THERE.
[ct=1707.322] OUT TO THE 30 IT WILL COME.
[ct=1709.750] IN COMES WANT.
[ct=1714.019] KIRK: IMAGINE HAVING AN OLDER
[ct=1715.276] BROTHER AS GOOD AS J.J. WATT.
[ct=1717.984] YOU TRY TO DEAL WITH HIM IN THE
[ct=1719.264] NFL BUT EVEN IN COLLEGE.
[ct=1720.544] GOING TO THE SAME SCHOOL, HE'S
[ct=1721.865] VERY DIFFERENT STYLE OF PASS
[ct=1726.302] ROUNDS ARE -- PASS RUSHER.
[ct=1726.302] YOU CANNOT IMITATE HIM.
[ct=1729.845] HE HAD TO CARVE HIS OWN LANE AND
[ct=1729.845] HE'S DONE THAT OBVIOUSLY
[ct=1733.052] THROUGHOUT HIS COLLEGE CAREER
[ct=1733.052] AND BRILLIANT NFL CAREER.
[ct=1736.766] AL: JEROME FORD IS THE RUNNING
[ct=1738.033] BACK NOW.
[ct=1741.902] COMES OUT TO THE 20 YARD LINE.
[ct=1741.902] IT WAS OUTSIDE THE GOAL LINE.
[ct=1746.411] DOWN INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=1746.411] FORD IS THE RUNNING BACK HERE.
[ct=1752.112] THE PASS IS CAUGHT HERE.
[ct=1755.454] LONG MOVE FOR A GAIN OF 15
[ct=1756.637] YARDS.
[ct=1759.174] BIG CATCH.
[ct=1760.248] SOONER OR LATER, YOU KNEW THEY
[ct=1761.575] WOULD PICK UP A FIRST DOWN AND
[ct=1761.575] THEY DID.
[ct=1766.364] KIRK: GOING BACK TO THE KICK
[ct=1767.632] RETURN.
[ct=1767.632] LOOKS LIKE IT WAS TOUCHED.
[ct=1770.413] OUTSIDE OF THE END ZONE, RIGHT?
[ct=1773.004] >> SURE.
[ct=1774.319] ZONE.
[ct=1777.475] IN THE KICK BROUGHT IT IN THE
[ct=1777.475] END ZONE DOWN THERE.
[ct=1779.082] IT'S A TOUCHBACK BUT IT COMES TO
[ct=1781.571] THE 20 BECAUSE IT FIRST TOUCHED
[ct=1781.571] IN THE LANDING ZONE, NOT T
[ct=1786.241] AL: THEY START FROM THE 20.
[ct=1786.741] TAKE IT OUT TO THE
[ct=1789.560] FIRST FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1790.884] THE PASS IS CAUGHT ON THE NEAR
[ct=1792.641] SIDE.
[ct=1794.862] SPUN AROUND.
[ct=1795.788] TAKEN DOWN FOR A GAIN OF 8
[ct=1797.159] JERRY JEUDY.
[ct=1799.828] KIRK: EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A TEAM
[ct=1801.141] THAT WANTED TO TRY TO ESTABLISH
[ct=1802.487] THE RUN, EVERYONE WE SPOKE TO
[ct=1807.873] THIS WEEK SAID, WE HAVE TO GET
[ct=1809.201] OUR RUNNING GAME GOING.
[ct=1809.201] WE'VE GOT TO GET
[ct=1810.448] GAME GOING.
[ct=1811.672] WHICH WE ALL KNOW THEY WANT TO
[ct=1814.181] DO, ESPECIALLY WITH NICK CHEUNG.
[ct=1815.509] THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO
[ct=1815.509] THAT.
[ct=1817.231] ONE THING THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
[ct=1819.828] DO IS THROW THE BALL.
[ct=1821.091] ESPECIALLY GETTING IT OUT OF HIS
[ct=1822.385] HANDS QUICKER.
[ct=1825.002] TRIED THE FIRST COUPLE SERIES.
[ct=1826.242] NOW THEY ARE ABLE TO THROW IT.
[ct=1829.195] AL: ANOTHER FIRST DOWN HERE.
[ct=1833.104] JERRY JUNIOR GOES BACK TO BACK.
[ct=1834.462] RUSSELL WILSON LOOKS ACROSS THE
[ct=1835.732] FIELD AND SAYS, HE WAS MY
[ct=1837.398] THE LAST FEW YEARS.
[ct=1840.082] KIRK: WITH AMARI COOPER B
[ct=1841.280] TRADED TO BUFFALO, TERRY JUDY
[ct=1843.724] TAKES OVER AS THE MAIN GO TO
[ct=1843.724] WEAPON NOW.
[ct=1846.748] ALMOST WIDE RECEIVER ONE
[ct=1848.042] THIS OFFENSE.
[ct=1849.193] ALL THREE OF THESE RECEIVERS
[ct=1853.076] WITH AMARI COOPER NOW OUT, JUDY
[ct=1854.174] AND CEDRIC TILLMAN, PRETTY GOOD
[ct=1854.174] GROUP.
[ct=1860.027] NO JOKE WHO AND THE TIGHT END.
[ct=1861.043] A LOT OF WEAPONS.
[ct=1862.629] AL: HAVEN'T SEEN HIM TARGETED
[ct=1862.629] YET.
[ct=1863.913] MAYBE NOW.
[ct=1865.301] OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=1869.666] THAT'S CAUGHT BY JERRY JEUDY.
[ct=1872.158] TACKLED BY JOEY BOERNER.
[ct=1876.213] SO WINSTON IS NOW 4-6
[ct=1877.682] OF THOSE HAVE GONE TO JUDY.
[ct=1880.150] KIRK: THE OFFENSIVE LINE IS
[ct=1881.498] DOING A HECK JOB ON THIS DRIVE,
[ct=1882.832] GIVING HIM TIME.
[ct=1884.181] YOU TALKED ABOUT T.J. WATT.
[ct=1887.611] THE PUSH OFF AT THE TOP OF THE
[ct=1888.910] ROUTE BY JUDY.
[ct=1890.904] LOOK AT THE TIME HE HAS.
[ct=1891.744] THE ACCURACY BY WINSTON.
[ct=1895.700] AL: TOUCHING HIS HELMET SAYING,
[ct=1896.916] HOW ABOUT THAT?
[ct=1903.487] 8:20 TO GO IN THE HALF.
[ct=1912.566] FORD LOOKING FOR ROOM.
[ct=1915.675] BARRELS HIS WAY.
[ct=1917.003] HE MIGHT HAVE THE FIRST DOWN BY
[ct=1917.003] THE TIME THIS IS OVER.
[ct=1923.327] JEROME FORD, THEY WILL MARK HIM
[ct=1924.265] A LITTLE BIT SHORT OF THE FIRST.
[ct=1926.731] KIRK: HOW ABOUT THAT?
[ct=1929.295] THEY GET THIS DRIVE GOING
[ct=1929.295] THROUGH THE AIR.
[ct=1930.468] THEN YOU ARE CHANGING
[ct=1931.831] TRYING TO GET FRESH LEGS IN
[ct=1935.131] THIS IS JUST TREMENDOUS EFFORT.
[ct=1938.607] FORTIS JUST DRIVING HIS
[ct=1939.336] CARRYING DEFENDERS FOR ANOTHER
[ct=1939.336] FOUR OR FIVE YARD.
[ct=1943.395] AL: SECOND AND 1.
[ct=1945.452] SHOVED BACK IN.
[ct=1947.747] WINSTON PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1951.581] STILL REALLY IN THE REHAB
[ct=1954.546] PROCESS IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING.
[ct=1958.734] THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY
[ct=1958.734] DON'T OVERWORK
[ct=1960.082] POINT.
[ct=1963.244] KIRK: HE'S ONE OF THE H
[ct=1964.136] WORKERS.
[ct=1964.136] YOU KNOW HE'S GOING TO BE A GUY
[ct=1965.593] THAT WILL NEVER SAY NO.
[ct=1970.576] THEY HAVE SUCH GRATITUDE AND
[ct=1972.481] APPRECIATION FOR WHO HE'S BEEN.
[ct=1973.720] THEY ARE TRYING TO EAS
[ct=1974.908] BACK.
[ct=1974.908] HE'S TOLD US HE FEELS LIKE HE’S
[ct=1976.055] CLOSE TO 100%.
[ct=1980.167] AL: PASS TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=1980.167] SHORT GAME HERE.
[ct=1984.006] PRESTON SMITH WHO WAS PICKED UP
[ct=1984.006] RECENTLY FROM GREEN BAY.
[ct=1986.617] SECOND DOWN.
[ct=1989.212] KIRK: KEN DORSEY GET THE HANDLE
[ct=1989.212] NOW FOR THE BROWNS?
[ct=1992.346] TRYING TO FIND THE BEST WAY TO
[ct=1993.469] PUT THE DRIVE TOGETHER THE
[ct=1995.234] COUPLE SERIES WHERE THEY HAD
[ct=1995.234] GREAT FIELD POSITION.
[ct=1998.510] ENDED UP PUNTING AFTER TWO OR
[ct=1999.307] THREE OUTS.
[ct=2000.925] THIS TIME HE DECIDED TO OPEN IT
[ct=2004.688] UP WITH FORMATIONS.
[ct=2007.085] IT'S GOTTEN JAMEIS WINSTON INTO
[ct=2007.337] A NICE RHYTHM IN THE OFFENSE HAS
[ct=2007.337] RESPONDED.
[ct=2011.299] AL: THREE RUNS, FOR PASSES TO
[ct=2012.466] THIS POINT.
[ct=2015.151] SECOND DOWN AND NINE.
[ct=2016.474] KEEP IT ON THE GROUND HERE.
[ct=2019.395] DOWN TO THE 21.
[ct=2020.860] SETTING UP THIRD DOWN.
[ct=2023.309] KIRK: THE BROWNS WOULD TELL YOU
[ct=2024.412] THAT THEY'VE HAD SO MANY
[ct=2024.412] INJURIES UPFRONT.
[ct=2026.698] WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A
[ct=2028.057] STRENGTH WHICH IS THE RUNNING
[ct=2032.050] GAME BETWEEN WORKING BACK, THE
[ct=2033.874] REVOLVING DOORS OF INJURIES
[ct=2034.345] UPFRONT.
[ct=2036.845] THEY FINALLY FEEL THAT THEY ARE
[ct=2038.806] AS HEALTHY AS THEY CAN BE
[ct=2040.708] ESPECIALLY IN THE INTERIOR
[ct=2046.170] IT'S GOOD TO SEE.
[ct=2048.776] YOU START TO SEE HIM GET BETTER
[ct=2049.357] AT BLOCKING AS WELL.
[ct=2054.376] AL: FOUR-MAN RUSH.
[ct=2055.349] FIRES, CAUGHT.
[ct=2056.374] IT WILL BE A LITTLE SHORT OF THE
[ct=2059.318] ELIJAH MOORE THINKING A MINUTE
[ct=2064.592] AGO, THAT MAKES PATRICK QUEEN'S
[ct=2064.592] NIGHT.
[ct=2068.541] KIRK: HERE YOU GO.
[ct=2068.949] YOU ARE AT HOME.
[ct=2069.396] YOU ARE TO HYPHENATE.
[ct=2072.831] YOU ARE TAKING ON A DIVISION
[ct=2072.831] RIVAL.
[ct=2076.327] YOU HAVE BEATEN THEM 4-5 IN
[ct=2076.745] CLEVELAND.
[ct=2077.141] YOU HAVE TO GO FOR IT.
[ct=2080.944] AL: FOURTH AND 1.
[ct=2084.433] IT'S TRULY A HOME CROWD HERE.
[ct=2085.750] EVEN THOUGH PITTSBURGH IS 120
[ct=2088.863] MILES AWAY, NOT TOO MANY
[ct=2090.117] TERRIBLE TOWELS.
[ct=2091.362] NOT AS MANY AS WE NORMALLY SEE
[ct=2092.714] ANYWAY.
[ct=2092.714] FOURTH AND 1.
[ct=2096.137] CAN THEY PICK UP THE FIRST?
[ct=2097.421] INDEED.
[ct=2107.017] KIRK: THAT'S A GREAT JOB BY
[ct=2108.336] CHUCK FEELING THIS.
[ct=2109.635] HIS BALKAN BOUNDS OR IT CAN BE A
[ct=2109.635] CUTBACK OUT THIS WAY.
[ct=2113.045] WATCH THE VISION HERE.
[ct=2113.959] HE WILL READ THE BLOCK INTO LEFT
[ct=2113.959] SIDE HERE.
[ct=2116.562] THE LINEMEN ARE ABLE TO USE THE
[ct=2118.674] LEVERAGE.
[ct=2119.894] THE LEFT TACKLE, REALLY GOOD
[ct=2119.894] JOB.
[ct=2125.127] RIGHT TACKLE PLAYING LEFT
[ct=2125.127] TACKLE.
[ct=2126.361] A HECKUVA JOB TO HELP HIM OUT.
[ct=2129.158] >> PATRICK QUEEN WHO IS DOWN.
[ct=2131.272] ENTER A TIMEOUT AS THEY WORK ON
[ct=2132.220] QUEEN.
[ct=2133.577] LESS THAN FIVE TO GO
[ct=2134.560] AGO.
[ct=2138.206] 4:53 TO GO IN THE HALF.
[ct=2138.206] PATRICK QUEEN IS BACK ON THE
[ct=2140.134] BENCH.
[ct=2142.296] PAYTON WILSON PICKS HIS SPOT.
[ct=2145.185] FIRST DOWN AND 11 YARDS.
[ct=2146.327] WILSON WITH A THROW.
[ct=2146.327] ON THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=2149.326] DIVING TO THE 1-YARD LINE.
[ct=2153.255] FIRST CATCH OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=2154.473] SOONER OR LATER, YOU KNEW YOU
[ct=2155.408] WOULD GET -- THEY WOULD GO TO
[ct=2159.016] WINSTON IS NOW 7-9 FOR 63.
[ct=2162.917] KIRK: FIRST AND 10.
[ct=2164.161] THREE TIGHT ENDS IN THE GAME.
[ct=2165.532] IT'S A GREAT LOOK TO SHOW THAT
[ct=2166.855] YOU ARE RUNNING THE FOOTBALL AND
[ct=2170.105] THEY BUS THE TREND WITH KIM
[ct=2171.240] DORSEY AT THE PLAY ACTION.
[ct=2172.453] THE EYES OF THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=2175.249] NOBODY PICKS HIM UP.
[ct=2176.595] GREAT CALL THERE.
[ct=2183.552] AL: BRING THE FULLBACK IN HERE.
[ct=2185.592] FROM THE ONE.
[ct=2190.537] CHUCK SCORES.
[ct=2193.017] TO THE END ZONE.
[ct=2194.446] CLEVELAND TAKES THE LEAD.
[ct=2209.378] 12 PLAYS, 80 YARDS.
[ct=2213.345] KIRK: YOU HAVE TO GIVE DORSEY A
[ct=2213.345] LOT OF CREDIT FOR THE
[ct=2214.484] ADJUSTMENTS THEY MADE WITHIN THE
[ct=2214.742] GAME.
[ct=2219.993] THIS OFFENSE, THEY ARE VERY
[ct=2219.993] CONFIDENT IN WHAT THEY CAN DO.
[ct=2222.541] QUICK DECISIONS
[ct=2223.910] BALL OUT.
[ct=2225.173] THEY FEEL THEY CAN WIN SOME
[ct=2225.173] MATCHUP'S ON THE PERIMETER.
[ct=2227.787] ONCE THEY DO THAT, THEY ARE ABLE
[ct=2229.187] TO GET READY
[ct=2230.509] QUICK BALANC
[ct=2235.746] AL: HOPKINS IS GOOD.
[ct=2239.313] WINSTON ON THE DRIVE.
[ct=2240.613] 6-6 FOR A 55 YARDER.
[ct=2246.039] AL: IN THE NFL, THERE ARE SO
[ct=2246.039] MANY GAMES LIKE THIS.
[ct=2251.678] YET ONE TEAM IS ONLY FAVORED BY
[ct=2251.678] 3.5 OR FOUR POINTS.
[ct=2255.517] YOU TALK ABOUT A TRAP GAME AND
[ct=2256.675] WHAT THAT MEANS AND ALL THAT
[ct=2256.675] STUFF.
[ct=2259.210] I GUESS YOU CAN LOOK AHEAD AND
[ct=2260.455] AWAY.
[ct=2264.300] RIGHT NOW, TOOK A 3-0 LEAGUE --
[ct=2265.776] WHAT CAN YOU SAY?
[ct=2268.735] KIRK: FOR PITTSBURGH, THEY HAVE
[ct=2270.139] TO SCORE TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=2272.809] THEY CANNOT KICK FIELD GOALS NO
[ct=2273.901] MATTER WHO THEY ARE PLAYING.
[ct=2273.901] THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET ON
[ct=2276.239] THE ROAD AND CONTINUE THEIR
[ct=2279.308] EXECUTION AND NOT BE SATISFIED
[ct=2280.762] AND SETTLE FOR FIELD GOALS.
[ct=2283.151] THE OTHER THING THAT STUCK OUT
[ct=2284.432] TO ME, THAT LOOKED LIKE THE
[ct=2285.345] BROWNS OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=2289.827] WHO IS GOING TO WIN THE LINE OF
[ct=2289.827] SCRIMMAGE?
[ct=2293.500] THAT ALWAYS DECIDES THE OUTCOME.
[ct=2295.117] THAT DRIVE LOOKED LIKE THE
[ct=2296.952] BROWNS OFFENSIVE LINE THAT WE
[ct=2298.155] WERE EXPECTING TO SEE ALL YEAR
[ct=2298.155] LONG.
[ct=2307.729] AL: THAT KICK THROUGH THE END
[ct=2310.146] WE HAVE OTHER DEALS GOING.
[ct=2311.406] WORKS OUT GREAT.
[ct=2312.601] FROM THE 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=2315.254] A LITTLE TOSS BACK HERE.
[ct=2317.933] HARRIS PICKING UP A COUPLE.
[ct=2320.837] KIRK: INITIALLY HIS WIFE SAID,
[ct=2323.432] WHAT'S THE FUSS ABOUT THE
[ct=2323.432] FOOTBALL'S?
[ct=2326.684] WHY DO PEOPLE CARE SO MUCH?
[ct=2329.157] EARLY.
[ct=2330.124] NOW OBVIOUSLY SHE GETS IT.
[ct=2330.124] IT'S NICE FOR HIM TO BE ABLE TO
[ct=2331.504] UNPLUG.
[ct=2332.777] AL: FOR SURE.
[ct=2335.377] KIRK: BE AB
[ct=2336.925] NOT WORRY ABOUT THAT STRESS.
[ct=2341.317] AL: 28 YEARS, IT'S WORKING OUT.
[ct=2343.656] RUSSELL WILSON CONTINUES TO BE
[ct=2346.079] VERY ACCURATE.
[ct=2347.317] THE RECEIVERS ARE RUNNING GOOD
[ct=2348.529] ROUNDS.
[ct=2349.639] 10-10 SO FAR IN THIS GAME.
[ct=2352.115] AL: 128.
[ct=2353.754] YET TO THROW AN INCOMPLETION.
[ct=2357.752] HERE.
[ct=2357.752] UNDER PRESSURE.
[ct=2359.078] LOSES THE BALL.
[ct=2360.230] STRIPPED.
[ct=2362.452] THE BROWNS ARE THERE TO GET IT.
[ct=2367.289] MYLES GARRETT CAME IN.
[ct=2368.592] HE EXTRACTED IT.
[ct=2369.088] WINSTON REID COMES UP WITH IT.
[ct=2374.860] EARLIER, WILSON WAS ABLE TO
[ct=2377.677] RECOVER HARRIS'S FUMBLE.
[ct=2380.158] THERE GOES THE PLAYER OF THE
[ct=2387.904] KIRK: THAT'S PASSION
[ct=2388.913] ENERGY.
[ct=2390.082] THAT'S THE MATCHUP WE KEEP
[ct=2390.082] TALKING ABOUT.
[ct=2393.908] YOU WILL HELP OUT THE TIGHT END
[ct=2393.908] INITIALLY.
[ct=2394.512] HOW ABOUT DARNELL WASHINGTON.
[ct=2399.372] THAT'S NOT ENOUGH AGAINST MYLES
[ct=2399.372] GARRETT.
[ct=2402.080] HE KNOWS ABOUT THE SPEED.
[ct=2403.330] HE KNOWS ABOUT THE POWER THAT HE
[ct=2403.330] HAS.
[ct=2405.771] 275 POUNDS.
[ct=2408.880] SOMETIMES IT'S NOT ABOUT THE
[ct=2408.880] SACK.
[ct=2411.602] IT'S THAT LENGTH.
[ct=2412.840] GETTING HIS HANDS ON THE BALL TO
[ct=2414.086] KNOCK IT AWAY FROM RUSSELL.
[ct=2419.560] AL: SHORT STEEL FROM THE 30 LAWN
[ct=2420.965] -- 31.
[ct=2423.405] THE LONG DRIVE.
[ct=2423.405] THE DEFENSE HAS TO COME BACK.
[ct=2426.720] THAT PASS.
[ct=2427.655] REACHING UP FOR IT.
[ct=2427.655] ELIJAH MOORE MAKES THE GRAB.
[ct=2431.579] THE BROWNS LOOKING
[ct=2432.815] BUT A TWO-EIGHTS TEAM.
[ct=2435.338] KIRK: NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
[ct=2437.899] THIS WEEK, I WENT BACK AND I
[ct=2437.899] LOOKED AT JAMES WINSTON.
[ct=2442.411] FOLLOWED HIS CAREER SO CLOSELY
[ct=2443.587] IN COLLEGE AT FLORIDA STATE AND
[ct=2444.717] WHAT HE DID EARLY IN HIS CAREER
[ct=2446.341] AT TAMPA.
[ct=2448.850] IT WENT AWAY AFTER 2019.
[ct=2448.850] DOWN IN NEW ORLEANS.

[ct=2466.108] THEY PICK UP A FIRST DOWN WITH
[ct=2467.266] FORWARD PROGRESS.
[ct=2468.308] KIRK: I THOUGHT HE HAD
[ct=2469.639] INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE ABOUT
[ct=2472.163] THOSE YEARS IN NEW ORLEANS.
[ct=2474.736] HE SAID ESPECIALLY IN 2020 WHEN
[ct=2476.417] HE LOST HIS STARTING DROP --
[ct=2479.760] JOB, HE THREW 30 PICKS IN TAMPA.
[ct=2482.212] HE HIT ROCK BOTTOM IN NEW
[ct=2485.993] ORLEANS AND SAID, I LOOK
[ct=2488.444] I GOT TO LEARN FROM DREW
[ct=2491.540] AND SEAN PAYTON.
[ct=2494.216] SEE HIM COME IN EVERY MORNING
[ct=2497.696] AND STUDY HIS NOTHING WILL KEEP
[ct=2499.072] FROM THEIR APPOINTED ROUNDS.
[ct=2503.473] WE WERE INVITED ON TO THE

[ct=2505.863] TONIGHT AFTER THE GAME.
[ct=2508.365] KIRK: I DIDN'T GET TO

[ct=2608.744] INSTEAD, HE WORKS FROM THE LEFT.

[ct=2611.289] HE'S LOOKING.
[ct=2613.868] HE SEES SIX FLASH SO HE COMES
[ct=2614.720] OFF OF IT AND COMES BACK.
[ct=2618.506] THAT'S ALL HE’S COACHED TO DO IN

[ct=2762.794] THIRD WHICH WAS NEGATED BY A
[ct=2763.755] DEFENSIVE PENALTY.
[ct=2766.594] THIS MIGHT BE 34 YARDS.

[ct=2906.887] KIRK: THEY ARE TALKING DOWN
[ct=2909.128] THERE WITHOUT A RECEI
[ct=2910.301] LOOKING.
[ct=2912.682] SOMETIMES YOU SEE THE WRATH
[ct=2912.682] COMING IN WITH A LATE GROUNDING
[ct=2913.697] CALL.
[ct=2914.223] LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO
[ct=2915.449] MOVE ON.
[ct=2918.911] AL: LOOK LIKE JEFFERSON AND
[ct=2920.255] MUNCIE WERE NOT ON THE SAME
[ct=2921.581] WILSON RETREATS.
[ct=2924.229] GOING DEEP.
[ct=2927.536] THERE'S CONTACT.
[ct=2928.806] IS THERE ANY FLAG?
[ct=2930.126] THERE IS NONE.
[ct=2934.499] MARK EMERSON AND GEORGE PICKENS
[ct=2936.712] GETTING TANGLED UP.
[ct=2936.712] PICKENS PLEADING HIS CASE.
[ct=2938.016] THEY SAY, NO.
[ct=2939.305] YOU HAVE 11 SECONDS.
[ct=2942.563] KIRK: WHAT MAKES ME NERVOUS IS
[ct=2943.560] WHEN A DEFENSIVE BACK DOESN'T
[ct=2946.179] HAVE A FEEL FOR WHERE HE IS AND
[ct=2946.179] WHERE THE FOOTBALL IS.
[ct=2947.719] WATCH EMERSON.
[ct=2949.158] THAT'S THE ONE ASPECT THAT MAKES
[ct=2951.838] YOU NERVOUS THAT A CALL COULD
[ct=2951.838] COME IN.
[ct=2954.525] AL: LITTLE ARM BAR THERE.
[ct=2955.820] NO FLAG.
[ct=2958.490] THIRD AND 10.
[ct=2968.200] HE IS TO GET SACKED BACK AT THE
[ct=2968.200] 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=2974.655] WHAT A SHOW HE'S PUTTING ON.
[ct=2977.203] THREE SACKS TONIGHT.
[ct=2979.604] KIRK: NOW WE'VE SEEN HIM
[ct=2980.858] IT ONE-ON-ONE.
[ct=2984.070] INSTEAD OF WORKING OUT HERE, HE
[ct=2984.627] WORKS TO THE INSIDE.
[ct=2986.168] NOW HE GETS MATCHED UP THERE
[ct=2986.168] AGAINST A ROOKIE ZACH
[ct=2988.716] THE CENTER.
[ct=2990.413] ZACH FRAZIER SAID, WHAT DID I DO
[ct=2990.413] TO DESERVE THIS?
[ct=2993.113] EDGE.
[ct=2996.866] AL: THE CLEVELAND BROWNS SHOCKED
[ct=2998.026] BALTIMORE THREE WEEKS AGO.
[ct=3000.456] TRYING TO SHOCK PITTSBURGH
[ct=3003.017] 10-3.
[ct=3008.467] >> MYLESCHRIS BOSWELL TO KICK OF
[ct=3015.365] AND THE BROWNS WILL START AT
[ct=3015.365] THEIR 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=3017.979] MOMENTS
[ct=3019.235] STEFANSKI.
[ct=3023.109] KAYLEE: YOUR OFFENSE SCORED ON
[ct=3023.109] THOSE LAST TWO DRIVES.
[ct=3024.299] HOW DO YOU WANT TO CONTINUE
[ct=3025.620] SECOND HALF?
[ct=3028.126] >> THIS IS A TOUGH TEAM.
[ct=3029.627] IT IS AFC FOOTBALL.
[ct=3029.627] WE KNEW THIS WOULD BE A
[ct=3030.892] BATTLE.
[ct=3032.155] WE HAVE TO DO OUR JOB EARLY
[ct=3033.328] THE FIRST POSSESSIONS.
[ct=3035.972] WE HAD TOO MANY LITTLE MISTAKES
[ct=3035.972] AND YOU CANNOT DO THAT AGAINST A
[ct=3037.255] GOOD FOOTBALL TEAM.
[ct=3039.953] KAYLEE: MYLES GARRETT AS HUGE
[ct=3041.249] TRACTOR IN THAT FIRST HALF.
[ct=3042.613] T.J. WATT ESSENTIALLY NO FACTOR.
[ct=3042.613] HOW DO YOU CONTINUE THAT?
[ct=3046.482] >> I WILL WORRY ABOUT OUR A GUY
[ct=3047.834] IN 95.
[ct=3050.524] WE WILL NEED HIM TO FINISH THIS
[ct=3054.886] AL: CLEVELAND NOW STARTING FROM
[ct=3056.766] THE.30 YARD LINE
[ct=3058.394] WINSTON THROWS AND THE CATCH IS
[ct=3060.941] MADE BY JORDAN AKINS, THE NUMBER
[ct=3060.941] TWO TIGHT END.
[ct=3063.375] GAIN OF 12.
[ct=3066.859] KIRK: DOES HE LOOK SO
[ct=3068.125] WELL-PREPARED TONIGHT.
[ct=3069.524] THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
[ct=3069.524] NEUTRALIZE T.J. WATT TONIGHT.
[ct=3073.631] NOT BEING EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST
[ct=3074.993] HALF AS FAR AS GETTING TO THE
[ct=3076.389] QUARTERBACK.
[ct=3077.618] A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH BEING
[ct=3078.957] CHIPPED, BEING DOUBLE-TEAMED.
[ct=3083.647] DIFFERENT GUYS TRYING TO ACCOUNT
[ct=3084.992] FOR IT.
[ct=3087.035] LET'S SEE WHAT TJ AND THE
[ct=3087.035] STEELERS CAN DO T
[ct=3088.614] HIM GOING IN THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=3092.559] AL: PICK UP OF ABOUT THREE ON
[ct=3092.559] THE GROUND.
[ct=3095.145] WE HAVEN'T EVEN MENTIONED THIS,
[ct=3096.428] BUT DESHAUN WATSON WAS THE
[ct=3098.764] QUARTERBACK, TORE HIS ACHILLES.
[ct=3100.884] THAT IS THE REASON WINSTON GOT
[ct=3102.117] THE OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=3105.646] KIRK: HE LOOKS GREAT.
[ct=3105.646] THERE IS T.J. WATT'S NUMBERS.
[ct=3111.948] THE 11 PASS RUSH SNAPS HE HAS
[ct=3111.948] HAD SO FAR.
[ct=3115.523] HE IS ITCHING TO GET AFTER
[ct=3115.523] WINSTON.
[ct=3116.846] WINSTON FOR THE MOST PART HAS
[ct=3116.846] BEEN CLEAN.
[ct=3120.892] HE MOVED AROUND A LITTLE BIT BUT
[ct=3120.892] THE LINE HAS DONE A G
[ct=3122.671] TAKING CARE OF HIM.
[ct=3124.975] AL: PLAY ACTION.
[ct=3126.495] UNDER PRESSURE, SCRAMBLES,
[ct=3127.722] THROWS ON THE RUN.
[ct=3130.333] CAUGHT BY TILLMAN.
[ct=3132.935] PICKED UP BY THE STEELERS.
[ct=3142.117] TILLMAN HAD THE FIRST DOWN, AND
[ct=3143.463] JACKSON WILL WIND UP WITH THE
[ct=3147.042] KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE THE SAFETY
[ct=3148.645] CAME UP AND KNOCKED IT OUT.
[ct=3151.153] PUT HIS SHOULDER RIGHT ON THE
[ct=3152.293] FOOTBALL, WENT UP IN THE AIR.
[ct=3153.431] TILLMAN IS A PHYSICAL
[ct=3155.875] SECOND YEAR OUT OF TENNESSEE.
[ct=3157.140] 6'3", 215.
[ct=3159.544] JUST DOESN'T TAKE CARE OF THE
[ct=3159.544] BALL.
[ct=3163.000] A HECK OF A JOB BY ELLIOTT.
[ct=3165.297] IT IS A CLASSIC TACKLE.
[ct=3165.297] HE JUST GOT HIS
[ct=3166.704] TO POP IT LOOSE.
[ct=3169.317] AL: SPUN HIM AROUND.
[ct=3174.246] HE IS GETTING FED ON THE
[ct=3174.246] SIDELINE, MAKING THAT SIGN.
[ct=3176.616] NOW WITH A TURNOVER.
[ct=3184.876] AL: FROM THE 25 YARD LINE.
[ct=3190.079] THE STEELERS, THEIR FIRST PLAY
[ct=3190.079] OF THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=3192.733] HARRIS CUTTING TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=3192.733] GOOD MOVE.
[ct=3197.705] LUNGING FORWARD, PICKS UP NINE.
[ct=3199.036] HE IS OUR YARD SHY OF A FIRST
[ct=3200.267] SECOND AND 1.
[ct=3202.738] KIRK: WHEN THE STEELERS COME OUT
[ct=3204.347] AT HALFTIME THIS YEAR, THEY COME
[ct=3205.691] OUT WITH REALLY WELL-ADJUSTED
[ct=3207.025] PLANS.
[ct=3209.543] THEY ARE OUTSCORING THEIR
[ct=3210.849] OPPONENTS BY 80 POINTS IN THE
[ct=3212.176] SECOND HALF.
[ct=3213.524] THE BUFFALO BILLS.
[ct=3218.393] AL: TO THE GROUND AGAIN, 80
[ct=3218.393] YARD.
[ct=3222.085] AND NOW THE BROWNS THINK THEY
[ct=3223.319] CAME UP WITH THE BALL.
[ct=3223.319] OFFICIALS WILL COME IN.
[ct=3224.536] NOTHING YET.
[ct=3228.862] DOWN BY CONTACT.
[ct=3233.911] KIRK: YOU SEE RIGHT THERE, HE
[ct=3233.911] STILL HAS
[ct=3235.268] HE IS DOWN.
[ct=3244.443] AL: HE IS DOWN, BALL COMES OUT.
[ct=3244.915] TERRY MCCULLOUGH INDICATING DOWN
[ct=3249.489] BY CONTACT, AS BRAD ALLEN
[ct=3249.489] CONFIRMS.
[ct=3253.419] AND IT IS A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3255.890] THE 37 YARD LINE.
[ct=3263.058] GAIN OF ONE FIRST NAJEE HARRIS.
[ct=3267.313] HARRIS TONIGHT CARRIED THE BALL
[ct=3268.813] NINE TIMES, 26 YARDS, A LITTLE
[ct=3270.030] LESS THAN THREE PER CARRY.
[ct=3273.732] KIRK: THE BROWNS ARE LIVING UP
[ct=3273.732] TO THEIR OPPORTUNITY BY GYM
[ct=3276.458] SHORTS.
[ct=3277.709] PUTTING AS MANY BODIES UP THERE
[ct=3278.772] AS THEY CAN, LEAVING THEIR
[ct=3281.456] CORNERS OUT IN THE ISLANDS.
[ct=3282.689] THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE THEIR
[ct=3282.689] CORNERS CAN HOLD UP.
[ct=3286.883] FOR THE MOST PART, THEY HAVE
[ct=3286.883] DONE A GOOD JOB OF NOT GETTING
[ct=3290.684] BEING DOWNFIELD -- GETTING
[ct=3290.684] BEATEN DOWN FIELD.
[ct=3294.722] ESPECIALLY IN EARLY DOWNS.
[ct=3298.694] AL: SECOND DOWN, 9.
[ct=3301.959] WARREN TO THE 48.
[ct=3305.568] YOU ARE LOOKING AT A DEFENSE
[ct=3306.586] HERE, THEY WERE NUMBER ONE IN
[ct=3306.586] THE LEAGUE LAST YEAR.
[ct=3307.944] FEWEST YARDS ALLOWED.
[ct=3310.552] THIS YEAR, 19.
[ct=3313.048] KIRK: DIFFERENT YEAR, TON OF
[ct=3314.386] INJURIES.
[ct=3319.656] THE TRADE OF SMITH OVER TO
[ct=3319.656] DETROIT.
[ct=3320.953] MIKE WALLACE
[ct=3323.381] MIKE WAL--MY CALL HAD SOME
[ct=3324.773] ISSUES.
[ct=3329.357] ALEX WRIGHT WAS OUT WITH A TORN
[ct=3331.830] TRICEP IN WEEK FOUR.
[ct=3334.237] THEY LOST THREE OF THEIR FOUR
[ct=3335.646] BUS PASS RUSHERS OTHER THAN
[ct=3339.357] MYLES GARRETT -- OF THEIR FOUR
[ct=3340.784] BEST PASS RUSHERS OTHER THAN
[ct=3344.638] AL: WILSON, THE LITTLE LOLLIPOP,
[ct=3347.325] AND TRYING TO KEEP HIS BALANCE
[ct=3348.645] IS WARREN.
[ct=3353.179] THAT WILL SIGNAL A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3353.179] WOW.
[ct=3356.607] OR, OR --
[ct=3360.612] KIRK: OR SHORT BY A HALF A YARD.
[ct=3361.810] HOW ABOUT THAT EFFORT BY
[ct=3361.810] THORNHILL?
[ct=3363.163] HE WAS IN THE MIDDLE
[ct=3364.491] FIELD.
[ct=3365.796] HE MAKES THAT PLAY, AND
[ct=3366.924] GET ANOTHER GREAT PLAY BY
[ct=3368.212] WARREN.
[ct=3369.584] HE GETS HIT AND HE GETS ANOTHER
[ct=3372.235] 4.5, FIVE YARDS.
[ct=3376.076] AL: A FOURTH DOWN AND 1 AND THEY
[ct=3377.380] GO FOR IT, AND THEY STOP HIM.
[ct=3383.051] TAKES HIM DOWN.
[ct=3391.620] WARREN STOBRAVING THE ELEMENTS.
[ct=3394.502] FAIRLY TOASTY UP HERE.
[ct=3395.842] A SNOW GLOBE IN CLEVELAND
[ct=3399.715] THE SNOW COMING DOWN.
[ct=3399.715] TEMPERATURE IS 30 DEGREES.
[ct=3406.010] THEY TURN IT OVER.
[ct=3406.010] CLEVELAND STARTS AT THE 45 YARD
[ct=3409.930] LOOKING FOR ROOM, PICKING UP
[ct=3413.511] KIRK: LET'S LOOK AT THE PLAY.
[ct=3417.469] THE CLEVELAND DEFENSE SOMEWHAT
[ct=3419.309] CONFUSED, MAKING SURE EVERYONE
[ct=3420.500] TRIES TO GET LINED UP AT THAT
[ct=3421.731] SECOND LEVEL, BUT WATCH 90.
[ct=3424.832] GOING BACK TO HIS DAYS PLA
[ct=3426.085] IN MICHIGAN.
[ct=3427.406] A BIT UNDERSIZED FOR THE
[ct=3429.566] INTERIOR, BUT THAT QUICK
[ct=3431.047] MOVEMENT, ESPECIALLY THAT
[ct=3432.400] INITIAL BURST OFF THE BALL.
[ct=3436.680] THAT TIME, USES HIS HANDS.
[ct=3440.188] LET'S SEE IF
[ct=3441.366] CAPITALIZE.
[ct=3445.327] AL: GETS WRESTLED DOWN INSIDE
[ct=3448.049] THE 40 YARD LINE BY HAYWARD.
[ct=3449.383] A VERY NOISY CAREER.
[ct=3453.047] PICKED NUMBER ONE IN THE FIRST
[ct=3453.047] ROUND OUT OF OHIO STATE.
[ct=3455.386] SON OF IRON HEAD HAYWARD.
[ct=3457.850] KIRK: THAT'S RIGHT.
[ct=3459.127] IT LOOKS LIKE THIS YEAR WITH HIS
[ct=3460.446] FIVE SACKS, SIX TACKLES FOR A
[ct=3462.801] LOSS, HE HAS KNOCKED DOWN FIVE
[ct=3463.997] PASSES THIS YEAR, IT LOOKS LIKE
[ct=3465.091] HE IS IN HIS LATE
[ct=3466.385] THE WAY HE IS PLAYING.
[ct=3469.145] AL: 35 YEARS OLD.
[ct=3470.420] THIRD DOWN AND 4.
[ct=3475.048] KIRK: 0-4 TONIGHT ON THIRD
[ct=3475.048] DOWNS.
[ct=3479.698] AL: CAN THEY CONVERT?
[ct=3481.768] NO, THEY CAN'T.
[ct=3484.203] TIPPED AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=3492.777] THAT TIME, IT WAS --
[ct=3495.139] HAYWARD.
[ct=3498.091] USUALLY HE IS ABLE TO GET IN
[ct=3498.091] THERE AND AFFECT THE QUARTERBACK
[ct=3499.404] BY PRESSURING.
[ct=3501.813] THIS TIME, THE BALL IS OUT IN A
[ct=3502.573] HURRY AGAINST THAT BLITZ.
[ct=3503.916] HE IS ABLE TO BAT THE BALL DOWN.
[ct=3506.398] THEY COME OUT WITH A
[ct=3507.503] AND ARE ABLE TO GET A THREE AND
[ct=3510.400] PITTSBURGH DEFENSE STEPS UP
[ct=3511.799] AGAIN.
[ct=3521.479] THE KICK WILL BOUND INTO THE END
[ct=3525.933] TO THE 20 YARD LINE THEY WIL
[ct=3527.558] COME.
[ct=3527.558] DOWN BY SEVEN.
[ct=3529.464] ROOTED IN THIS PART OF T
[ct=3530.706] HISTORY.
[ct=3533.219] WHO SHOOK UP THE SNOW GLOBE?
[ct=3533.219] IT IS COMING DOWN MO
[ct=3534.523] HOUSE ALL NIGHT RIGHT NOW.
[ct=3535.850] KIRK: IT LOOKS GREAT FOR
[ct=3537.248] BEAUTIFUL.
[ct=3539.969] -- IT LOOKS GREAT
[ct=3543.124] AL: A NICE MOVE.
[ct=3544.702] HE IS FORCED OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=3547.373] A GAIN OF NINE.
[ct=3553.118] PUSHED OUT BY RONNIE HIT AND.
[ct=3555.841] THE DOG POUND.
[ct=3558.245] I DON'T KNOW.
[ct=3563.335] I THINK YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR
[ct=3563.335] MIND.
[ct=3567.907] KIRK: YOU TAILGATED ALL DAY.
[ct=3570.632] AL: I HAVE TO MAKE A STOP AT THE
[ct=3570.632] CLINIC AFTER THIS.
[ct=3576.423] KIRK: WE ARE SITTING HERE WITH
[ct=3578.837] THE CLEVELAND LEAD AT 10-3
[ct=3580.311] BECAUSE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
[ct=3582.900] OF THIS GAME, CLEVELAND HAS
[ct=3582.900] MISSED OPPORTUNITIES.
[ct=3585.420] A COUPLE TIMES IN PLUS
[ct=3586.866] TERRITORY.
[ct=3586.866] THEY TRIED THE FIELD GOAL EARLY.
[ct=3593.867] FOURTH AND INCHES IN THEIR OWN
[ct=3595.127] THEIR DEFENSE HAS BAILED THEM
[ct=3597.288] BUT THEIR OWN OFFENSE, YOU CAN
[ct=3597.288] SEE THE RESULTS.
[ct=3598.609] THEY HAVE TO START PUTTING THE
[ct=3599.981] DRIVE TOGETHER AND PUTTING
[ct=3601.387] POINTS ON THE BOARD.
[ct=3605.931] AL: NOTHING DOING HERE.
[ct=3610.861] THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=3616.010] TOMLINSON CAME IN,
[ct=3617.324] SECOND AND 10.
[ct=3622.907] KIRK: JIM SCHWARTZ IS MIXING UP
[ct=3622.907] THESE LOOKS WELL.
[ct=3627.469] GET OUT OF IT, PLAY SOME ZONE.
[ct=3628.913] THEY ARE BRACKET COVERAGE.
[ct=3631.586] RUSSELL WILSON RIGHT NOW SEEING
[ct=3632.885] THINGS THAT IS CAUSING HIM TO BE
[ct=3634.202] HESITANT INSTEAD OF ALLOWING
[ct=3635.505] THAT PASS RUSH, THAT TIME WITH
[ct=3638.451] TOMLINSON, TO BE ABLE TO GET
[ct=3638.451] HOME.
[ct=3646.435] AL: REALLY COMING DOWN NOW.
[ct=3647.913] TO THE GROUND.
[ct=3649.250] TO KNOW WHERE.
[ct=3653.088] -- TO NOWHERE.
[ct=3656.787] DEVIN BUSH MAKES THAT TACKLE.
[ct=3657.957] THE THIRD.
[ct=3660.383] KIRK: WE PUT A GRAPHIC UP TO
[ct=3660.383] SHOW YOU THE DRIVE.
[ct=3662.757] IF YOU ARE A STEELERS FAN,
[ct=3664.122] IS WRONG WITH PITTSBURGH'S
[ct=3664.122] OFFENSE?
[ct=3669.183] IT IS WHAT IS RIGHT WITH
[ct=3670.542] CLEVELAND'S DEFENSE TONIGHT.
[ct=3671.673] WE CAN POINT OUR FINGER ALL WE
[ct=3673.011] WANT AT PITTSBURGH.
[ct=3674.299] THIS IS ABOUT A CLEVELAND
[ct=3675.628] DEFENSE READY TO PLAY AND
[ct=3676.960] INCREDIBLY WELL PREPARED.
[ct=3680.023] AL: NUMBER ONE IN THE LEAGUE
[ct=3681.821] LAST YEAR, NUMBER 19 THIS YEAR,
[ct=3683.054] BUT THEY LOOK LIKE NUMBER ONE
[ct=3691.671] WILSON GOING DEEP.
[ct=3692.919] HE'S GOT A MAN WIDE OPEN.
[ct=3695.391] IT IS JEFFERSON THIS TIME.
[ct=3698.641] JEFFERSON GETS FREE DOWN THE
[ct=3698.641] SIDELINE.
[ct=3699.807] FORGET THE ELEMENTS.
[ct=3703.602] RUSSELL SAYS I WILL TAKE A SHOT
[ct=3707.555] KIRK: WE JUST TALKED ABOUT HOW
[ct=3707.555] THEY ARE CHANGING LOOKS.
[ct=3710.162] THEY SHOW ONE LOOK PRE-SNAP,
[ct=3711.504] THEN THEY CHANGE IN THE POST
[ct=3711.504] SNAP.
[ct=3714.458] HE GOES TO THE INSIDE AND STAYS
[ct=3717.524] ON CALVIN AUSTIN, AND THAT
[ct=3718.864] SLIGHT HESITATION OPENS UP THE
[ct=3720.221] OUTSIDE TO GET IT TO WHERE HE
[ct=3722.816] REALLY WANTED TO GO, TO THE
[ct=3724.149] JEFFERSON MAKES A HECK OF A
[ct=3724.149] CATCH THERE.
[ct=3730.345] AL: HARRIS, NO.
[ct=3733.046] STOPPED IN THE BACKFIELD THAT
[ct=3734.304] TIME.
[ct=3739.676] SECOND AND 12.
[ct=3744.634] KIRK: IF YOU ARE A STEELERS FAN,
[ct=3746.117] YOU KNOW THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE
[ct=3746.117] ALL YEAR.
[ct=3748.475] WHEN THEY GET TO THIS PART OF
[ct=3749.708] THE FIELD, THINGS SLOW DOWN.
[ct=3752.353] THEY ARE NOT QUITE INTO THE RED
[ct=3753.295] ZONE, BUT THEY ARE 30TH IN THE
[ct=3755.341] NFL IN THE RED ZONE.
[ct=3758.534] IT IS A MATTER OF STILL BEING
[ct=3758.897] ABLE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL AND
[ct=3762.100] GETTING THE BALL OUT OF THE
[ct=3763.234] HANDS OF RUSSELL WILSON QUICKLY.
[ct=3764.514] YOU DON'T WANT HIM BACK THERE
[ct=3764.514] HOLDING ONTO THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=3770.131] AL: THIRD AND 11.
[ct=3770.131] FLUSHED OUT.
[ct=3772.145] LOOKS TO THE SIDELINE.
[ct=3776.832] SKIRTS THAT SIDELINE AND COMES
[ct=3778.333] CLOSE TO PICKING UP A FIRST
[ct=3780.737] TACKLED JUST IN BOUNDS.
[ct=3783.285] KIRK: I THINK HE GOT IT THERE.
[ct=3784.577] AL: YES, HE
[ct=3788.617] KIRK: KEEP IN MIND
[ct=3789.880] WILSON IS 35 YEARS OLD.
[ct=3791.230] HE DID NOT PLAY EARLIER BECAUSE
[ct=3792.538] OF A CALF INJURY.
[ct=3793.776] THAT IS WHY FIELDS PLAYED.
[ct=3797.650] HERE HE IS, UNDERSTANDS EXACTLY
[ct=3797.650] WHERE HE NEEDS TO GO.
[ct=3800.998] THERE THEY MIGHT TAKE A PEEK
[ct=3804.631] DEFINITELY SHORT OF THE MARKER.
[ct=3807.110] AL: DO THEY WANT TO CHALLENGE?
[ct=3809.373] KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE THEY DID
[ct=3810.623] BRING IT BACK.
[ct=3816.157] THE SNOW IS FOR REAL NOW.
[ct=3833.063] CLEVELAND FORCING IT ON DOWNS
[ct=3834.299] WITH FOURTH DOWN COMING UP.
[ct=3836.781] KIRK: THEY ARE 0-2 O
[ct=3839.504] THEY HAVE NOT DONE IN THESE
[ct=3839.504] SHORT GUARD SITUATIONS.
[ct=3845.979] WHEN IT IS THESE DEFENSES, THEY
[ct=3847.318] HAVE TO CALL BOSWELL TO KICK IT.
[ct=3851.519] AL: IT WOULD BE INTO THE WIND.
[ct=3854.037] THIS WOULD BE 42 YARDS FOR CHRIS
[ct=3861.797] 41 YARDS.
[ct=3865.899] AND TIMEOUT IS TAKEN.
[ct=3869.771] KIRK: AND THE PLAY CLOCK DOWN TO
[ct=3869.771] FIVE SECONDS.
[ct=3875.749] THIS IS IMPORTANT.
[ct=3876.148] YOU NEED TO COME AWAY HERE WITH
[ct=3876.148] POINTS.
[ct=3879.552] YOU ARE DOWN TO UNDER FIVE
[ct=3879.552] MINUTES TO GO IN THE THIRD
[ct=3880.924] QUARTER.
[ct=3883.575] FIELD CONDITIONS, THE WAY YOUR
[ct=3884.846] OFFENSE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO
[ct=3885.938] FINISH THESE DRIVES, YOU HAVE
[ct=3885.938] GOT TO COME AW
[ct=3888.844] AL: WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO
[ct=3889.781] NOW?
[ct=3892.293] THERE IS DANNY SCHMIDT.
[ct=3895.556] LONGTIME SPECIAL TEAMS COACH,
[ct=3899.314] WORKING ON THAT GUM.
[ct=3903.755] THE OFFENSE IS GOING T
[ct=3904.768] BACK OUT.
[ct=3904.768] FOURTH DOWN AND 1.
[ct=3909.976] KIRK: INTERESTING, MIKE WILLIAMS
[ct=3909.976] HAD BEEN PLAYING A LOT TONIGHT.

[ct=3916.112] AL: MADE A BIG CATCH A COUPLE
[ct=3916.112] WEEKS AGO AGAINST WASHINGTON.
[ct=3919.874] A PICK UP FROM THE JETS.
[ct=3921.204] A LONGTIME FORMER CHARGER.
[ct=3924.680] HERE THEY GO, FOURTH AND 1.
[ct=3928.632] JAYLEN WARREN IS THE BACK.
[ct=3933.779] PLAY CLOCK AT 4:00.
[ct=3940.559] WILSON TO THROW IF HE CAN.
[ct=3942.705] SPINS AWAY, FIRES.
[ct=3945.009] CAUGHT ALONG THE SIDELINE.
[ct=3949.013] THE TIGHT END GETS FREE, WORKED
[ct=3949.830] HIS WAY FREE.
[ct=3951.087] GARRETT THAT TIME CHASING WILSON
[ct=3951.087] AND HIT HIM.
[ct=3955.003] KIRK: NOT ONLY DID HE CHASE HIM,
[ct=3957.542] HE HAD A RUNNING START.
[ct=3959.002] AND RUSSELL WILSON KNEW EXACTLY
[ct=3959.002] WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN TO HIM.
[ct=3960.263] EVEN IN THE SNOW.
[ct=3964.318] WATCH THE RUNNING START.
[ct=3965.694] LOWERS THE BOOM RIGHT INTO HIS
[ct=3967.109] RIBS AS HE RELEASES THAT
[ct=3970.876] AND LOOK AT THAT, RIGHT ON THE
[ct=3970.876] MONEY FOR THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3972.201] THAT IS CLUTCH BY RUSSELL
[ct=3976.326] AL: EIGHT YARD GAIN.
[ct=3980.285] THE MARKINGS ARE STARTING TO GET
[ct=3980.285] OBSCURED HERE.

[ct=3992.309] AL: TACKLE BY ISAIAH MAGUIRE.
[ct=3994.829] KIRK: HOLDING THAT RIGHT ANKLE.
[ct=3997.561] HE ALMOST SLIPPED OUT OF IT.
[ct=4002.801] RED ZONE AN ISSUE FOR
[ct=4004.122] WILL THEY COME UP WITH ANSWERS
[ct=4005.493] HERE?
[ct=4008.203] AL: THIS IS NOT A LOW HALF
[ct=4008.203] STADIUM,
[ct=4009.560] WONDERING.
[ct=4012.116] -- THIS IS NOT ALOHA
[ct=4013.403] CASE YOU WERE WONDERING.
[ct=4016.859] KIRK: OHIO WEATHER, BABY.
[ct=4017.568] I LOVE IT.
[ct=4021.878] AL: HIGH STEP, RECOVERS.
[ct=4024.669] GETS TACKLED AT THE 17 YARD
[ct=4031.279] THE HIGH SNAP FROM THE ROOKIE
[ct=4031.279] CENTER.
[ct=4033.884] NOTHING IS EASY RIGHT NOW.
[ct=4035.247] KIRK: NO.
[ct=4039.020] IT IS NOT A MATTER OF SNAPPING
[ct=4039.020] AT HIGH.
[ct=4041.330] IT IS THE GRIP OF THE FOOTBALL
[ct=4041.330] AS MUCH AS ANYTHING.
[ct=4043.959] RUSSELL WILSON JUST BEING AN
[ct=4047.860] ATHLETE, IS ABLE TO SOMEHOW COME
[ct=4049.195] BACK DOWN WITH IT.
[ct=4050.565] NOW WAY BEHIND THE STI
[ct=4053.250] AL: THIRD AND 13.
[ct=4061.266] HAS TO GET TO THE 3 FOR A FIRST
[ct=4066.472] WILSON IN THE BLIZZARD.
[ct=4070.039] THAT WILL BE CAUGHT BY PICKENS,
[ct=4072.582] BUT WELL SHORT OF A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4075.387] EMERSON WAS COVERING ON THE
[ct=4075.387] PLAY.
[ct=4076.696] FIELD GOAL UNIT COMING OUT.
[ct=4079.342] KIRK: DIDN'T EVEN HESITATE.
[ct=4085.690] AL: FOURTH AND 7, 2:30 TO GO IN
[ct=4092.965] THE DIVISION LEADER LEADING THE
[ct=4096.679] TEAM IN THE BASEMENT.
[ct=4100.693] TWO AND 18.
[ct=4103.460] 28 YARD ATTEMPT.
[ct=4111.755] BOSWELL'S KICK, IF HE CAN FIND
[ct=4111.755] IT, IS GOOD.
[ct=4114.377] I LOST SIGHT OF IT.
[ct=4121.560] THE SERIES PREMIERING OCTOBER 26
[ct=4122.673] -- DECEMBER 26 ONLY ON PRIME.
[ct=4127.838] WE HAVE TO PUT IN THESE VIRTUAL
[ct=4127.838] LINES SO YOU CAN SEE THEM.
[ct=4130.589] OTHERWISE, FORGET ABOUT IT.
[ct=4133.054] KIRK: GOOD EFFORT.
[ct=4136.979] AL: OUR GANG IN THE TRUCK.
[ct=4139.712] SNOW.
[ct=4143.715] AL: HELPING US OUT, THANK GOD.

[ct=4157.972] KAYLEE, YOU MAKING SNOW INJURES
[ct=4160.471] THERE?
[ct=4164.382] KAYLEE: I WANT TO EXPLAIN THE
[ct=4166.177] ADVANTAGE THE BROWNS HAVE AS
[ct=4166.177] THEY DRIVE DOWN THE FIELD
[ct=4170.990] TOWARDS THE LEFT END ZONE.
[ct=4174.670] RUSSELL WILSON WAS GETTING
[ct=4177.385] PELTED IN THE FACE WITH SNOW.
[ct=4178.837] I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HIS VISION
[ct=4180.111] WAS OBSTRUCTED, BECAUSE MINE WAS
[ct=4181.508] AS I TRY TO WALKED ON THE
[ct=4185.506] BUT HERE WITH UNDER TWO MINUTES
[ct=4186.771] LEFT, THEY WILL SWITCH SIDES
[ct=4188.104] SOON, AND THE BROWNS NEED TO
[ct=4189.396] TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS.
[ct=4192.099] AL: VERY SIGNIFICANT, AS THEY GO
[ct=4192.099] WITH THE WIND.
[ct=4195.834] DOWN FIELD, REACHING UP TO MAKE
[ct=4197.188] THE CATCH.
[ct=4201.888] THAT IS BLAKE WHITEHEART.
[ct=4205.659] SORRY ABOUT THAT.
[ct=4207.286] THEY JUST ACTIVATED HIM.
[ct=4209.196] 29 YARDS.
[ct=4210.291] HE WAS JUST ACTIVATED BEFORE TH
[ct=4215.113] KIRK: HOW ABOUT THE CALL ON
[ct=4216.175] FIRST AND 10?
[ct=4218.903] IN THESE CONDITIONS, TO COME
[ct=4218.903] DOWN WITH IT.
[ct=4221.626] WHEN UP AGAINST DONTE JACKSON.
[ct=4224.321] BIG ADVANTAGE WITH HIS HEIGHT.
[ct=4225.598] COMES DOWN WITH THAT FOOTBALL.
[ct=4231.052] AL: OUT OF WAKE FOREST, SECOND
[ct=4232.325] YEAR IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=4237.918] MAKES A BIG PLAY.
[ct=4241.716] KIRK: NOT ONLY IS THAT A GREAT
[ct=4244.347] PLAY, THINK ABOUT A 10-6 GAME,
[ct=4245.366] UNDER A MINUTE TO GO IN
[ct=4246.930] THIRD QUARTER.
[ct=4248.248] IF NOTHING ELSE, WHAT A JOB
[ct=4249.548] AFFECTING FIELD POSITION HERE.
[ct=4251.953] WE WILL SEE IF THE BROWNS DO
[ct=4253.417] THIS ON THE STRIVE.
[ct=4256.084] THAT IS A GREAT WAY TO RESPOND
[ct=4257.433] FROM JAMEIS WINSTON AND THIS
[ct=4257.433] OFFENSE.
[ct=4261.558] THEY TRUST HIM RUNNING THIS
[ct=4262.956] OFFENSE RIGHT NOW.
[ct=4266.997] AL: HALF A MINUTE TO GO IN THE
[ct=4269.529] DROP TO THE OUTSIDE, GETS TAKEN
[ct=4272.191] DOWN TO THE 31.
[ct=4274.785] T.J. WATT, QUIET NIGHT SO FAR,
[ct=4277.306] MAKES THE TACKLE HERE.
[ct=4278.668] SETS UP A THIRD AND 5.
[ct=4281.352] THEY'VE GOT EVERYTHING BUT THE
[ct=4281.352] ZAMBONI OUT HERE RIGHT NOW.
[ct=4285.443] KIRK: BIG THIRD DOWN.
[ct=4296.179] WILL THEY RUN THE PLAY BEFORE
[ct=4296.179] THEY SWITCH SIDES?
[ct=4302.247] THEY DO.
[ct=4303.539] WINSTON THROWS OVER THE MIDDLE,
[ct=4303.539] CAUGHT.
[ct=4306.476] AND BREAKING THE TACKLE.
[ct=4310.056] TILLMAN BANGED IN.
[ct=4315.705] THEY WILL LINE AND UP, SEE
[ct=4316.877] WHETHER THEY GOT IT OR NOT.
[ct=4318.098] THAT IS THE WAY THE QUARTER WILL
[ct=4319.350] END.
[ct=4320.574] 10-6 HURT ON THE
[ct=4323.102] THEY PUT HIM IN THE BLUE TENT.
[ct=4327.750] KIRK: HE STAYS ON HIS FEET,
[ct=4327.750] TRIES TO FINISH IT.
[ct=4330.419] CAME CLOSE.
[ct=4333.788] THEY MEASURED.
[ct=4335.129] HE WAS FOUR OR FIVE INCHES
[ct=4335.129] SHORT.
[ct=4336.329] HE GOES INTO THE TENT.
[ct=4339.865] THE BROWNS OFFENSE STILL OUT ON
[ct=4341.108] THE FIELD.
[ct=4344.907] YOU ARE RIGHT, WE NEED A
[ct=4344.907] ZAMBONI.
[ct=4348.686] GET THE SHOVELS OUT.
[ct=4355.070] AL: CHANGING CLEATS HERE.
[ct=4359.468] ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS
[ct=4360.430] AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME.
[ct=4363.163] KIRK: THE STEELERS HAVE WON TWO
[ct=4368.490] GAMES THIS YEAR WHERE THEY HAVE
[ct=4369.824] NOT SCORED A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=4369.824] WEEK ONE AGAINST ATLANTA.
[ct=4375.658] AL: BIG FOURTH AND INCHES.
[ct=4386.396] JERRY JEUDY LINES UP IN THE
[ct=4387.319] BACKFIELD.
[ct=4392.822] THEY GIVE IT TO THE FULLBACK,
[ct=4394.016] AND OF THE FIRST MAN THROUGH
[ct=4394.016] WILL PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4396.795] KIRK: THEY END
[ct=4400.170] A LITTLE CLOSER TO GET DOWNHILL
[ct=4401.698] IN A HURRY.
[ct=4404.361] AL: SHOPPED BEHIND HIM AS THE
[ct=4407.678] FULLBACK.
[ct=4409.645] KIRK: A LITTLE EYE CANDY THERE.
[ct=4413.445] THEY USED THE POWER OF WHAT HE
[ct=4413.445] CAN DO.
[ct=4415.888] GOOD BLOCKS ON THE LEFT SIDE.
[ct=4418.041] THE BROWNS ARE PLAYING WELL.
[ct=4419.349] WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO LOSE?
[ct=4420.659] THEY ARE 2-8.
[ct=4421.951] AL: NOTHING.
[ct=4424.684] KIRK: EXACTLY.
[ct=4428.500] AL: TO THE 23, OPEN.
[ct=4431.195] MAKING THE CATCH TO THE 5 YARD
[ct=4432.543] LINE, JORDAN AKINS.
[ct=4436.747] ON THIS DRIVE, AKINS THE NUMBER
[ct=4439.142] TWO TIGHT END AND WHITE HART
[ct=4440.613] MAKING THE BIG PLAYS.
[ct=4444.755] KIRK: WATCH WINSTON HIT THIS
[ct=4446.061] SEEM BETWEEN THE SAFETY A
[ct=4447.386] CORNER.
[ct=4448.705] GETS IT OUT QUICKLY, GIVES HIS
[ct=4449.778] TIGHT END A CHANCE TO NOT ONLY
[ct=4452.544] CATCH THE BALL BUT BE ABLE TO
[ct=4453.729] PROTECT HIMSELF FROM THAT HIT.
[ct=4457.668] JAMEIS WINSTON SINGH THE
[ct=4460.345] COVERAGE TONIGHT FOR PITTSBURGH
[ct=4460.345] EVEN IN THESE COVERAGE.
[ct=4464.295] AL: ON THE GROUND.
[ct=4466.880] CAN THEY STOP HIM?
[ct=4473.651] AT THE 1.5 IS NICK CHUBB, SECOND
[ct=4473.651] AND GOAL.
[ct=4478.788] KIRK: WE ARE TALKING SUCH A BIG
[ct=4478.788] DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 17-6 AND
[ct=4480.134] 13-6.
[ct=4481.722] AL: ESPECIALLY IN THIS WEATHER.
[ct=4485.924] KIRK: THE WEATHER, LATE IN THE
[ct=4487.188] PITTSBURGH OFFENSE IS STRUGGLING
[ct=4488.626] TO FINISH DRIVES.
[ct=4496.877] AL: THE DRIVE STARTED AT THEIR
[ct=4498.999] OWN 35.
[ct=4502.766] BOTH ELIGIBLE HERE.
[ct=4508.640] DOWN TO FOUR, THREE, AND THE
[ct=4508.640] PLAY CLOCK.
[ct=4511.094] GETS THE SNAP.
[ct=4514.371] STOPPED AT THE 1.
[ct=4520.924] LOUDERMILL MAKES THAT TACKLE.
[ct=4523.343] KIRK: THEY KEEP POUNDING THE
[ct=4524.600] ROCK.
[ct=4524.600] THEY GOT CONFIDENCE.
[ct=4527.241] THIS OFFENSIVE LINE HAS HELD
[ct=4527.241] THEIR OWN
[ct=4528.393] THEY GOT CONFIDENCE THEY CAN WIN
[ct=4529.777] UP FRONT.
[ct=4532.443] YOU HAVE CHUBB, WHO HAS DONE A
[ct=4533.843] GOOD JOB OF MOVING THE PILE.
[ct=4540.874] GOT A STEALER -- STEELER DOWN.
[ct=4544.529] AL: LANDON ROBERTS.
[ct=4546.834] THE INJURY STOPPAGE.
[ct=4558.117] THE STEELERS ARE MINUS ALEX
[ct=4558.117] HIGHSMITH ALREADY.
[ct=4562.272] NOW YOU HAVE ROBERTS DOWN.
[ct=4565.345] KIRK: THAT WAS A BIG COLLISION
[ct=4568.096] WITH THE LINEBACKER, 59.
[ct=4570.864] AND ROBERTS.
[ct=4572.350] IT TOOK HIM OUT OF THE GAME.
[ct=4574.993] THEY RUN THE BALL WITH CHUBB,
[ct=4576.303] THEY COME UP HALF A YARD SHORT,
[ct=4578.042] THEY ARE GOING FOR IT.
[ct=4578.042] THEY ARE GOING FOR THIS
[ct=4579.264] TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=4580.681] AL: YOU HAVE TO.
[ct=4583.127] KIRK: WORST CASE, YOU DON'T MAKE
[ct=4586.947] IT, YOU PIN THE OFFENSE BACK.
[ct=4588.189] THEY HAVE TO RUN CHUBB AND
[ct=4589.559] IF THEY CAN GET IT IN.
[ct=4592.192] AL: MAKE HIM GO 99 YARDS
[ct=4593.529] THEY DON'T HAVE TONY DORSETT TO
[ct=4593.529] DO IT.
[ct=4596.273] THIRD AND GOAL.
[ct=4610.699] CLEVELAND IS 0-6 ON THIRD
[ct=4611.955] HERE THEY ARE, THIRD DOWN AND
[ct=4618.033] FAKE, THROWS.
[ct=4621.041] HE HAD IT AND COULDN'T HOLD ON.
[ct=4627.861] SIX POINTS THERE, AND HE CAN'T
[ct=4629.168] BRING IT IN FOR THE GOAL.
[ct=4633.116] KIRK: WHAT A CALL BY DORSEY.
[ct=4634.496] I THINK THEY EXPECTED TO RUN
[ct=4634.496] THIS WITH CHUBB.
[ct=4638.283] THE BALL JUST
[ct=4639.629] THE BALL.
[ct=4642.331] IT GAVE HIM THE C
[ct=4643.717] BACK THERE AND KNOCK IT AWAY.
[ct=4646.210] AL: HOW IRONIC, THE NUMBER TWO
[ct=4647.653] AND THREE TIGHT ENDS MAKE THE
[ct=4649.938] BIG PLAYS ON THIS DRIVE, AND
[ct=4649.938] YOUR TOP TIGHT END DROPS IT.
[ct=4652.837] KIRK: POINTS
[ct=4657.763] AL: JEROME FORD IS IN THE
[ct=4659.096] FOURTH DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=4665.919] FOUR IN MOTION.
[ct=4665.919] WINSTON UNDER PRESSURE.
[ct=4670.043] INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=4671.137] WHOA.
[ct=4683.443] JAMEIS WINSTON.
[ct=4684.703] IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS GOING TO
[ct=4684.703] GET SACKED.
[ct=4688.634] 65 YARDS IN 10 PLAYS.
[ct=4692.680] KIRK: JAMEIS WINSTON IS LI
[ct=4694.126] DREAM RIGHT NOW.
[ct=4695.514] AL: NO DOUBT.
[ct=4699.225] KIRK: THIS GUY, YOU SAW HIS
[ct=4700.434] SMILE WHEN HE WAS TALKING TO
[ct=4701.690] KAYLEE IN THE PREGAME, SAID HOW
[ct=4704.156] BLESSED HE FEELS TO PLAY
[ct=4706.038] HOW FITTING ON A FOURTH DOWN
[ct=4707.347] THE STEELERS CAUGHT IN MAN TO
[ct=4708.693] MAN COVERAGE.
[ct=4712.687] LOOKS BEHIND HIM.
[ct=4715.230] HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO,
[ct=4715.230] ESCAPES.
[ct=4717.888] NOBODY HAD HIM AND HE
[ct=4723.169] AL: 0-2, HIS FIRST RUSHING TD IN
[ct=4723.169] FOUR YEARS.
[ct=4729.315] JERRY JEUDY INSIDE.
[ct=4734.697] THROWS, AND THIS TIME THOUGH
[ct=4735.979] TWO-POINT CONVERSION.
[ct=4735.979] I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS CRAZY.
[ct=4739.086] I YEAR AGO, JOE FLACCO COMES OUT
[ct=4744.322] OF NOWHERE, THEY WERE CHANTING
[ct=4745.676] WACKO, FLAK OH, FLAT GO.
[ct=4749.825] TONI WHAT AN INTERESTING
[ct=4749.825] SEQUENCE WITH JAMEIS WINSTON.
[ct=4753.808] LOOK AT HIS HELMET, BANG.
[ct=4755.148] YOU CAN SEE THE COMMUNICATION
[ct=4756.608] ASPECT OF HIS HELMET, POPPING
[ct=4757.164] OUT OF HIS HELMET.
[ct=4760.198] HE IS TRYING TO FIX IT, SAYING,
[ct=4761.495] I CAN'T HEAR YOU, I CAN’T
[ct=4761.495] COMMUNICATE.
[ct=4763.983] IT IS DANGLING IN FRONT OF HIS
[ct=4765.332] EYES, RIGHT IN HIS VISION.
[ct=4767.955] HE STILL MAKES A PERFECT THROW
[ct=4769.266] TO THE TIGHT END NJOKU AND THEY
[ct=4772.072] GET THE TWO-POINT CONVERSION TO
[ct=4772.072] GO UP.
[ct=4774.658] HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THAT?
[ct=4777.283] THAT IS CRAZY.
[ct=4779.925] KIRK: NOTHING IS GOING TO STOP
[ct=4781.293] NUMBER FIVE TONIGHT.
[ct=4783.912] YOU WONDER, WHY WOULD YOU GO UP
[ct=4783.912] BY 12?
[ct=4786.543] YOU GET A TOUCHDOWN AND A TWO
[ct=4789.293] POINTER AND THEY STILL HAVE THAT
[ct=4790.619] 12 POINT LEAD.
[ct=4791.967] AL: THEY HAVE TO GET TWO
[ct=4794.716] TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=4797.356] DROPPED FROM THE 5.
[ct=4801.446] PATTERSON TO THE 32 YARD LINE.
[ct=4802.803] KAYLEE: IT TURNS OUT WHAT YOU
[ct=4806.540] SAW POP OUT OF JAMEIS'S HOME IT
[ct=4807.848] WAS THE BATTERY TO THE COMMUNE
[ct=4809.095] ACACIAN DEVICE, BUT IT STAYED
[ct=4809.095] ATTACHED.
[ct=4813.098] I AM TOLD BY THE BROWNS STAFF
[ct=4814.419] THAT HE MAINTAIN HIS ABILITY TO
[ct=4814.419] COMMUNICATE THE ENTIRE TIME.
[ct=4816.878] BUT THEY DID POP IT BACK
[ct=4818.651] THE HELMET IS GOOD TO GO.
[ct=4822.373] KIRK: WHAT A STORY WITH JAMEIS.
[ct=4826.240] WE HAVE SEEN OTHER QUARTERBACKS
[ct=4827.510] WASH OUT.
[ct=4828.714] THEY ARE DONE, THEY ARE BACKUPS,
[ct=4832.760] AND THEY RESURFACE.
[ct=4835.350] BAKER HAS DONE THAT, FLACCO HAS
[ct=4836.757] DONE THAT.
[ct=4836.757] WE HAVE SEEN SAM DARNOLD
[ct=4838.187] IN MINNESOTA.
[ct=4839.526] AL: THE THROW HERE.
[ct=4840.767] FOUR-YARD GAIN.
[ct=4843.201] DARNELL WASHINGTON.
[ct=4844.553] SECOND AND 6.
[ct=4848.590] KIRK: WHO BETTER THAN MYLES
[ct=4848.590] GARRETT?
[ct=4852.537] WHAT HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO.
[ct=4853.914] YOU TALK ABOUT RELIABILITY.
[ct=4856.762] HE CAME INTO THIS GAME FEELING
[ct=4858.149] THREATENED AND CHALLENGED.
[ct=4859.085] HE DIDN'T REALLY CARE.
[ct=4860.720] HE SEEMED LOCKED IN.
[ct=4864.628] ANY TIME HE GOES UP AGAINST THE
[ct=4865.959] STEELERS, AGAINST T.J. WATT, HE
[ct=4865.959] WANTS TO TAKE
[ct=4867.311] LEVEL.
[ct=4868.675] THE BROWNS DEFENSE.
[ct=4872.706] AL: FIELD NOW IN THE GAME.
[ct=4874.056] WE SAW HIM EARLIER.
[ct=4875.369] THEY GO TO JUSTIN FIELDS.
[ct=4876.538] HE WILL KEEP IT.
[ct=4882.429] DOWN THE SIDELINE HE GOES BEFORE
[ct=4882.429] HE IS RUSHED OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=4885.249] OFF THE BLOCK FROM CONNOR
[ct=4885.249] HEYWARD.
[ct=4889.163] THEY BRING HIM IN FOR A SPECIAL
[ct=4891.862] PLAY FROM A SPECIAL PACKAGE
[ct=4893.214] HE GETS 30.
[ct=4897.156] KIRK: TYSON HILL GAVE THEM AN
[ct=4898.464] ISSUE WITH DEFENSE.
[ct=4904.065] STAYS IN BOUNDS AND PICKS UP
[ct=4905.458] SOME HUGE YARDS.
[ct=4907.613] I TALKED TO JIM SCHWARTZ ABOUT
[ct=4908.711] THAT THIS WEEK AND HE TALKED
[ct=4911.362] ABOUT WE PREPPED, AND EVEN IN A
[ct=4912.359] SHORT WEEK, WE KNOW THAT FEELS
[ct=4912.359] WILL COME IN THERE.
[ct=4913.895] YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR THOSE
[ct=4917.891] LOOKS AND SET THAT EDGE.
[ct=4917.891] THAT TIME HE GOT
[ct=4919.175] BIG BLOCK.
[ct=4924.585] AL: THEY RUN INTO EACH OTHER.
[ct=4924.585] FIELD STAYS IN HERE.
[ct=4927.330] HE GOES INTO THE BENCH.
[ct=4931.641] DEVIN BUSH TAKES CARE OF HIM
[ct=4934.137] WHO IS COMING INTO THE GAME,
[ct=4934.695] WILSON OR FIELDS?
[ct=4938.286] KIRK: FIELDS WILL STAY IN THE
[ct=4939.549] GAME, IT LOOKS LIKE.
[ct=4940.813] WHETHER ANYBODY HAS WATCHED HIM
[ct=4943.199] PLAY, OBVIOUSLY HE
[ct=4948.502] RIGHT NOW, RUSSELL WILSON
[ct=4950.049] THROWING THE MORE T
[ct=4951.331] STYLE OFFENSE.
[ct=4952.618] BUT DON'T BE SURPRISED TO SEE
[ct=4955.203] HIM AT ANY POINT PULL THIS BALL
[ct=4956.510] BACK AND TRY TO FIND A RECEIVER
[ct=4956.510] TO MAKE THE PLAY.
[ct=4959.072] THE DEFENSE CHANGES THEIR
[ct=4960.141] SCHEME.
[ct=4964.098] AL: SECOND DOWN AND 12.
[ct=4965.347] SNAPPED A LITTLE HIGH.
[ct=4975.427] THEY GOT JORDAN HICKS COMING IN
[ct=4977.981] AND A FLAG, PERSONAL FILE.
[ct=4983.546] KIRK: HE LANDED ON HIM WITH ALL
[ct=4983.546] HIS WEIGHT ON THE
[ct=4986.336] FOLLOW-THROUGH, ONCE HE HIT HIM
[ct=4987.696] AFTER THE THROW.
[ct=4996.072] THIS ONE OVER THE LAST COUPLE
[ct=4996.988] YEARS, SOMETIMES THEY GET
[ct=4998.520] CONFUSED, BUT IT IS WATCHING HIM
[ct=4999.738] DRIVE INTO THE GROUND.
[ct=5003.341] >> HE HAS TO BRACE, HE HAS TO
[ct=5003.341] GET TO THE SIDE.
[ct=5007.397] PUNISHES THEM WITH A SHOULDER.
[ct=5008.768] CLEARLY A BODYWEIGHT FOUL.
[ct=5011.308] AL: NOW RUSSELL WILSON IS BACK
[ct=5012.628] IN.
[ct=5014.001] TOUGH TO STOP WHEN YOU'RE COMING
[ct=5014.001] IN ON SKATES.
[ct=5016.645] 10 MINUTES TO PLAY IN
[ct=5016.645] REGULATION.
[ct=5020.100] FROM THE 22.
[ct=5028.438] SHELBY HARRIS MAKES THE STOP.
[ct=5032.510] UNDER 10 MINUTES TO PLAY, 18-6
[ct=5036.860] KIRK: NOT TO SOUND LIKE A BROKEN
[ct=5039.359] RECORD, BUT THE RED ZONE AREA,
[ct=5039.359] THE PLUS TERRITORY FOR
[ct=5040.902] GUYS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING
[ct=5040.902] PROBLEM.
[ct=5044.390] RUSSELL WILSON HAS BEEN PLAYING
[ct=5044.390] WELL.
[ct=5046.907] DIDN'T YOU FEEL THAT WINFIELD
[ct=5049.543] WAS IN THERE, HE GIVE THEM A
[ct=5049.543] LITTLE SPARK, HE GIVE THEM A
[ct=5050.876] LITTLE SOMETHING?
[ct=5052.162] THE THREAT
[ct=5053.561] GETTING THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=5056.326] AL: THEY HAVE HAD SEVEN QUARTERS
[ct=5057.475] WITHOUT A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=5060.227] NOW YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE JUMP.
[ct=5067.284] >> NEUTRAL ZONE INFRACTION,
[ct=5068.501] DEFENSE, NUMBER 54.
[ct=5069.660] FIVE YARD PENALTY, SECOND DOWN.
[ct=5074.923] AL: COMING ACROSS THE LINE,
[ct=5076.547] TURNING A SECOND AND EIGHT AND
[ct=5076.547] TO A SECOND AND 3.
[ct=5079.466] KIRK: KIND OF A NO-BRAINER.
[ct=5088.576] WHO CAN HELP RUSSELL WILSON OUT
[ct=5089.972] IN THE PAST GAME?
[ct=5092.473] WHO CAN WIN ONE-ON-ONE HERE?
[ct=5095.181] PICKENS DOWN, ISOLATED
[ct=5096.606] ONE-ON-ONE AGAINST EMERSON.
[ct=5097.914] AL: MAYBE
[ct=5103.836] AL: MA WILL SOME THROWS.
[ct=5106.045] HERE IS HARRIS -- WILSON THROWS.
[ct=5109.664] HERE IS HARRIS.
[ct=5109.664] HARRIS DIVES FORWARD FOR
[ct=5112.986] KIRK: HOW BIG IS THAT TWO-POINT
[ct=5114.473] CONVERSION THAT HE HAD WITH
[ct=5115.835] BATTERY HANGING OUT OVER HIS
[ct=5115.835] FACE?
[ct=5118.460] ENDED UP GOING UP BY 12.
[ct=5123.866] INSTEAD OF LET'S GO AND BE SAFE,
[ct=5124.910] KICK THE EXTRA POINT, THE
[ct=5124.910] DECISION TO GO FOR TWO
[ct=5127.505] TO 12 IS BIG.
[ct=5131.483] AL: THEY NEED TWO TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=5135.794] OTHERWISE, YOU HIT ONE FIELD
[ct=5135.794] GOAL AND A TWO-POINT CONVERSION
[ct=5137.246] WITH A TD.
[ct=5139.281] FIRST AND GOAL.
[ct=5144.287] WARREN FLANKING WILSON.
[ct=5147.675] INSTEAD, THEY GIV
[ct=5148.971] PATTERSON.
[ct=5150.351] COMING AROUND THE CORNER.
[ct=5150.351] NOWHERE.
[ct=5156.271] DEVIN BUSH IS
[ct=5157.007] SECOND DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=5160.520] KIRK: BOY, DID DEVIN BUSH FEEL
[ct=5160.520] THIS THE ENTIRE WAY.
[ct=5164.342] INSTEAD OF READING THESE GUYS
[ct=5166.752] WHO ARE HOLDING, HE IS RIGHT
[ct=5168.288] HERE AND HE DOES A GOOD JOB OF
[ct=5169.606] USING HIS EYES AND TRUSTING IT
[ct=5171.030] AND BEING ABLE TO WORK THROUGH
[ct=5172.559] THE BLOCK FOR THE TIGHT END.
[ct=5176.368] GOOD INSTINCTS, GOOD FEEL,
[ct=5177.729] DISCIPLINED STAYING HOME AND A
[ct=5177.729] GOOD JOB FIGHTING TO THE BLOCK
[ct=5178.018] TO FINISH THE PLAY.
[ct=5716.005] MEANWHILE, WINSTON IS
[ct=5716.961] ON THAT SAME TOUR
[ct=5718.396] RIGHT NOW IN A WAY.
[ct=5719.737] NOT THAT THE TEAMS
[ct=5721.022] FORGOT ABOUT HIM.
[ct=5722.249] >> Referee: HOLDING
[ct=5724.906] DEFENSE NUMBER 24.
[ct=5726.195] 5-YARD PENALTY,
[ct=5727.540] AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5727.540] >> Al: THERE’S AN
[ct=5731.554] FOR WINSTON, WHAT’S
[ct=5732.843] >> Kirk: RIGHT NOW
[ct=5733.842] HE’S STANDING OVER
[ct=5738.383] THERE ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=5740.824] >> Al: DORIAN THOMPSON
[ct=5742.764] HE COMES BACK IN THE
[ct=5743.387] GAME, WHICH IS A
[ct=5744.928] SURPRISE.
[ct=5746.395] >> Kirk: AND HE’S KIND
[ct=5747.364] OF THEIR VERSION OF
[ct=5747.364] JUSTIN
[ct=5749.204] AS A CHANGE-UP AND
[ct=5750.532] WHAT HE CAN DO.
[ct=5755.439] LET’S SEE WHAT YOU
[ct=5755.439] GOT?
[ct=5756.954] WHAT HE GOT IS A
[ct=5757.224] HAND-OFF HERE TO
[ct=5759.660] PICKS UP ABOUT 3.
[ct=5761.172] SO DORIAN THOMPSON AND
[ct=5763.010] WATSON.
[ct=5763.010] WHEN WATSON TORE HIS
[ct=5766.565] ACHILLES, THOMPSON AND
[ct=5767.491] ROBINSON STARTED THAT
[ct=5769.175] GAME AND WINSTON THE
[ct=5769.470] NEXT GAME.
[ct=5771.862] SO HE COMES OUT FOR
[ct=5774.402] ONE PLAY, AND HE GOES.
[ct=5775.003] >> Kirk: HE IS A
[ct=5775.841] THREAT.
[ct=5776.765] HE CAN THROW IT ALSO
[ct=5779.374] BUT ALSO GOT THAT
[ct=5780.261] ABILITY TO PULL THE
[ct=5781.674] BALL AND GET AROUND
[ct=5782.414] THE EDGE THE WAY
[ct=5783.511] FIELDS CAN.
[ct=5785.500] THE WAY WINSTON HAS
[ct=5785.765] BEEN THROWING THE
[ct=5786.384] FOOTBALL, DONE A
[ct=5787.754] REALLY GOOD JOB MAKING
[ct=5788.539] DECISIONS.
[ct=5792.029] LOOK AT THEIR
[ct=5792.305] COVERAGE, A LITTLE BIT
[ct=5795.025] >> Al: NO PLAY.
[ct=5795.803] >> Kirk: LEFT TACKLE
[ct=5797.992] LOOKED LIKE HE MOVE.
[ct=5798.628] REMEMBER HE GAVE UP A
[ct=5801.236] SACK AND THIS TIME HE
[ct=5801.567] MOVES.
[ct=5808.493] >> Al: TAKING THE
[ct=5808.493] PLACE OF THE INJURED
[ct=5812.491] KAYLEE?
[ct=5812.491] >> HE WENT IN WITH AN
[ct=5815.583] ATHLETIC TRAINER FOR A
[ct=5816.806] MINUTE AND IT WASN’T
[ct=5816.806] LONG BEFORE THE
[ct=5818.325] SPECIALIST JOINED HIM
[ct=5821.119] THAT SPECIAL
[ct=5822.330] LEFT, AND IT LOOKS
[ct=5823.344] LIKE THEY’RE HEADED TO
[ct=5825.432] THE MONITOR.
[ct=5827.954] HUGE NIGHT, THREE
[ct=5829.548] SACKS IN THE FIRST
[ct=5831.283] HALF.
[ct=5831.283] WATTS BEEN
[ct=5832.077] CHECK TONIGHT.
[ct=5838.294] PRESSURED.
[ct=5840.131] ON THE RUN.
[ct=5843.639] THROWS!
[ct=5846.244] LEAPING GRAB AT THE 40
[ct=5846.244] YARD LINE, JERRY
[ct=5850.148] JEUDY!
[ct=5853.308] STANDS TO PLAY, JEUDY
[ct=5854.511] HE GOT HIT.
[ct=5855.504] >> Kirk: YEAH, HE GOT
[ct=5857.012] HIT AFTER HE THREW
[ct=5859.485] HOW DID HE GET THIS
[ct=5859.485] BALL OVER TOP OF THIS
[ct=5861.489] COVERAGE?
[ct=5862.509] WE CAN BARELY SEE HIM.
[ct=5863.952] HOW DOES HE LOCATE
[ct=5865.726] JEUDY AND MAKE THIS
[ct=5869.127] THROW UP AND OVER THAT
[ct=5869.127] DEFENDER?
[ct=5871.980] >> Al: SONAR.
[ct=5871.980] >> Kirk: THAT WA
[ct=5873.299] INCREDIBLE.
[ct=5873.299] ON THE RUN, OVER
[ct=5874.699] ELLIOTT AND IN THE
[ct=5876.067] HANDS OF JEUDY ON THAT
[ct=5877.368] THIRD DOWN-PLAY.
[ct=5879.158] AND THEN TAKES A HIT
[ct=5880.199] ON -- WELL, NOT TOO
[ct=5880.199] MUCH OF
[ct=5885.234] >> Al: SLOW GETTING
[ct=5885.234] UP.
[ct=5888.144] FROM THE 39, OFF THE
[ct=5889.507] FAKE, ROLLING THE
[ct=5890.744] OTHER WAY.
[ct=5891.900] THROWS INTO TRAFFIC,
[ct=5893.344] AND THAT’S INCOMPLETE.
[ct=5894.717] TRYING TO GET IT TO
[ct=5896.094] NJOKU WAS ALSO IN
[ct=5897.213] AREA.
[ct=5898.692] 2nd AND 10.
[ct=5900.036] >> Kirk: JUST WHEN YOU
[ct=5901.387] THINK JAMEIS WINSTON
[ct=5902.738] AND THE BROWNS, SAME
[ct=5904.096] OLD BROWNS, STEELERS
[ct=5905.208] GOING TO FIND A WAY TO
[ct=5906.702] WIN AND THE BROWNS ARE
[ct=5910.823] JAMEIS WINSTON SAYS
[ct=5912.146] NOT SO FAST MY FRIEND
[ct=5914.769] WITH THAT COMPLETION,
[ct=5914.769] GETS INTO PLAUS
[ct=5922.510] >> Al: NOT SO FAST.
[ct=5936.060] THROWS, BROKEN UP.
[ct=5939.531] THAT TIME NJOKU COMES
[ct=5941.055] ON THE PLAY.
[ct=5943.747] KNOCKED AWAY BY BEANIE
[ct=5944.952] BISHOP.
[ct=5947.096] >> Kirk: I DON’T KNOW
[ct=5948.487] IF HE COULDN’T SEE
[ct=5951.150] ONE THING WITH JAMEIS
[ct=5952.312] WINSTON, HE GETS ON
[ct=5955.099] ROLL, HE’S A
[ct=5957.607] GUNSLINGER, GOING TO
[ct=5958.988] TAKE SOME CHANCES.
[ct=5960.373] VERY GOOD INTERCEPTING
[ct=5972.371] >> Al: 3rd AND 10.
[ct=5979.409] GOOD PROTECTION.
[ct=5980.705] THROWS, INTERCEPTED AT
[ct=5986.421] THE 21 YARD LINE!
[ct=5988.772] THEY PICK THEM OFF.
[ct=5988.772] DONTE
[ct=5990.276] >> Kirk: WELL, WE’VE
[ct=5992.924] SEEN A LOT OF GOOD
[ct=5992.924] DECISIONS TONIGHT BY
[ct=5993.860] JAMEIS WINSTON, AND
[ct=5996.940] HERE HE TRIES TO GET
[ct=5996.940] THIS FOOTBALL INTO
[ct=5999.378] AGAIN, YOU’VE GOT
[ct=5999.378] TOUGH CONDITIONS.
[ct=6000.843] BUT RIGHT BEFORE HE
[ct=6002.165] THROWS THIS, LOOK
[ct=6003.412] WHERE THE RECEIVER IS
[ct=6003.412] AND LOOK WHERE
[ct=6004.686] FOOTBALL ENDS UP GOING
[ct=6005.729] TO THE OUTSIDE RIGHT
[ct=6007.411] TO THE DEFENDER.
[ct=6008.682] SO YOU BREAK INTO THE
[ct=6010.068] RECEIVER.
[ct=6011.108] THE BALL IS THROWN
[ct=6012.794] MORE TO THE OUTSIDE
[ct=6014.175] WHERE DONTE JACKSON
[ct=6015.385] HAS OUTSIDE LEVERAGE.
[ct=6016.721] YOU CAN EVEN SEE THE
[ct=6017.730] WAY THE FOOTBALL CAME
[ct=6019.218] DON’T KNOW IF IT
[ct=6020.570] SLIPPED OUT OF HIS
[ct=6023.189] HAND, BUT IT DID NOT
[ct=6024.302] LOOK LIKE THE THROW HE
[ct=6025.814] MADE TONIGHT WHERE
[ct=6027.130] IT’S BEEN DECISIVE AND
[ct=6028.560] THE BALL’S COME OUT
[ct=6028.560] AND IT’S BEEN ON A
[ct=6031.400] THAT ONE KIND OF
[ct=6032.792] SLOPPY AND BOUNCED TO
[ct=6034.170] THE OUTSIDE ON HIM.
[ct=6035.181] COMES INTO PLAY RIGHT
[ct=6036.705] NOW WITH YOUR TIMEOUT
[ct=6038.063] USAGE.
[ct=6039.333] THEY HAVE ALL THREE.
[ct=6040.652] TO THE 27 YARD LINE HE
[ct=6041.730] GOES HERE.
[ct=6043.398] 2nd DOWN AND 7.
[ct=6044.721] WAY TO GO.
[ct=6046.145] LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT
[ct=6047.182] OUR NEXT GEN STATS
[ct=6048.759] POWERED BY AWS.
[ct=6050.086] WE TALKED ABOUT HIS
[ct=6051.423] VERTICAL PASSING GAME,
[ct=6052.744] WHAT HE’S KNOWN FOR
[ct=6053.743] HOSE MOON SHOTS.
[ct=6055.280] HAVEN’T SEEN A LOT OF
[ct=6059.308] MOON SHOTS.
[ct=6060.594] 4-6 FOR PASSES THROWN
[ct=6062.221] 20 YARDS OR FURTHER.
[ct=6063.479] GOOD JOB DEALING WITH
[ct=6064.840] FIELDS NOW INTO THE
[ct=6064.840] GAME WITH THE
[ct=6066.068] TO RUN IT.
[ct=6067.716] JUST WANT TO STAY
[ct=6068.971] INBOUNDS AND TRY TO
[ct=6070.336] PICK UP FIRST DOWNS.
[ct=6070.336] >> Al: AND GARRET OUT
[ct=6071.453] AT THE 10 AND HE’S IN
[ct=6072.951] THE GAME.
[ct=6075.573] 2nd AND 7.
[ct=6084.595] BIG THIRD DOWN HERE,
[ct=6086.089] BECAUSE IF THEY PICK
[ct=6087.504] UP A FIRST DOWN,
[ct=6088.070] YOU’VE GOT TO START
[ct=6089.386] THINKING OF USING YOUR
[ct=6090.669] TIMEOUTS, AND THEY’RE
[ct=6094.071] GOING TO USE ONE HERE.
[ct=6097.909] WITH 3:32 IT’S GOING
[ct=6101.209] TO BE 3rd DOWN AND
[ct=6103.569] >> Kirk: I THINK IT’S
[ct=6104.965] IMPORTANT TO TALK
[ct=6108.320] ABOUT JUSTIN
[ct=6110.092] YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
[ct=6110.092] PRACTICE TIME IT PUTS
[ct=6113.677] ON KEVIN STEFANSKI AND
[ct=6115.213] ANY TEAM THAT GETS
[ct=6115.213] READY TO PLAY THE
[ct=6116.580] STEELERS.
[ct=6117.861] YOU CAN’T JUST SAY
[ct=6119.228] IT’S Z
[ct=6120.279] YOU’VE GOT TO SPEND SO
[ct=6122.384] MUCH TIME, AND HE MAY
[ct=6123.547] NEVER EVEN GET
[ct=6124.827] THE FAME.
[ct=6126.106] IT TAKES AWAY THE T
[ct=6127.053] YOU CAN SPEND ON
[ct=6128.584] RUSSELL WILSON AND THE
[ct=6128.584] NORMAL OFFENSE THEY’RE
[ct=6129.872] ATTACKING YOU WITH
[ct=6131.199] BECAUSE OF THE THREAT
[ct=6133.053] OF THE ZONE READ GAME,
[ct=6135.927] POWER READ GAME, QB
[ct=6137.143] RUN GAME.
[ct=6139.386] IT’S A NICE WRINKLE
[ct=6139.386] NOT FOR TONIGHT BUT
[ct=6142.264] THE REST OF THE WAY.
[ct=6143.354] >> Al: YOU’VE GOT TWO
[ct=6146.164] QUARTERBACKS, ONE IN
[ct=6152.744] 1A, 3rd AND 4.
[ct=6160.961] FIELDS STAYS IN.
[ct=6163.958] HARRIS NEXT TO HIM.
[ct=6163.958] FIELDS IS GOING TO
[ct=6166.655] THROW AND THROW LONG!
[ct=6167.946] AND IT’S INCOMPLETE.
[ct=6171.979] INTENDED FOR P
[ct=6173.508] PICKENS GOING WILD,
[ct=6175.661] WANTED THE
[ct=6177.036] EMERSON COVERING HIM
[ct=6179.570] ON THE PLAY, AND THIS
[ct=6179.570] IS EXACTLY WHA
[ct=6180.579] CLEVELAND WAS PRAYING
[ct=6180.579] FOR.
[ct=6183.630] THEY STOP HIM AND STOP
[ct=6183.630] THE CLOCK TH
[ct=6185.067] >> Kirk: THIS IS MART
[ct=6186.247] OF WHAT YOU GET
[ct=6187.692] COVERAGE WISE WHEN YOU
[ct=6187.692] HAVE AN ATHLETIC
[ct=6191.644] QUARTERBACK IN THERE.
[ct=6192.933] IT’S JUST ONE-ON-ONE.
[ct=6196.992] EMERSON IS RUNNING
[ct=6198.270] AIMLESSLY, BUT IT
[ct=6199.663] DIDN’T REALLY AFFECT
[ct=6201.254] HIM ON HIS R
[ct=6202.706] >> Al: MEANWHILE A
[ct=6202.706] CATCH HERE.
[ct=6205.349] IT’S A SHORT ONE.
[ct=6206.301] IT’S WAITMAN.
[ct=6207.594] CAN’T EVEN TELL, DID
[ct=6207.594] SOMEONE GET A HAND ON
[ct=6209.115] IT?
[ct=6210.454] >> Kirk: I THINK HE
[ct=6210.454] SHANKED IT.
[ct=6211.587] HE DID NOT HIT THAT
[ct=6215.410] GOOD AT ALL.
[ct=6215.410] IT CAME OFF THE SIDE
[ct=6218.388] OF HIS FOOT.
[ct=6219.575] >> Al: WE SAW A
[ct=6223.452] 12-YARD CAUGHT BEFORE
[ct=6224.687] FROM BOJORQUEZ, AND
[ct=6226.241] THIS ONE ON WHAT WAS A
[ct=6226.241] 4th AND
[ct=6228.882] SPOTTED IN PITTSBURGH
[ct=6230.182] TERRITORY, WE THINK.
[ct=6231.586] >> Kirk: YEAH, THAT’S
[ct=6231.586] JUST CAME OFF THE
[ct=6232.945] INSIDE OF HIS FOOT.
[ct=6234.248] NOBODY GOT A HAND ON
[ct=6235.630] JUST MISSED IT.
[ct=6237.617] THINK ABOUT THIS, THIS
[ct=6238.935] STEELERS TEAM WINS
[ct=6240.201] GAMES LIKE THIS AGAIN
[ct=6240.201] WITH SPECIAL TEAMS
[ct=6241.626] BEING A BIG PART OF
[ct=6242.986] THE EQUATION.
[ct=6244.326] AND HERE WITH THE GAME
[ct=6245.594] ON THE LINE, YOU NEED
[ct=6246.983] A BIG WANT.
[ct=6248.366] YOU SHANK ONE, AND NOW
[ct=6251.052] JAMEIS WINSTON A
[ct=6252.354] CHANCE TO BOUNCE BACK
[ct=6253.702] FROM THAT INTERCEPTION
[ct=6254.978] TO JACKSON.
[ct=6256.381] >> Al: THAT WAS A
[ct=6258.968] 15-YARD PUNT.
[ct=6260.371] AT THE 45.
[ct=6261.711] CLEVELAND NOW.
[ct=6261.711] THROUGH THE MIDDLE.
[ct=6266.764] A GAIN OF 7.
[ct=6268.142] >> Kirk: YOU WERE
[ct=6269.164] SAYING AT THE BREAK
[ct=6271.850] DUSTIN HOPKINS AT THE
[ct=6271.850] WEEK HE HAD LAST WEEK,
[ct=6275.783] REALLY THE YEAR HE’S
[ct=6277.226] HAD, COULD THIS GAME
[ct=6278.530] POTENTIALLY COME DOWN
[ct=6278.530] TO HIS LEGS.
[ct=6281.249] HE’S A GREAT KICKER,
[ct=6282.410] HE’S JUST HAD A TOUGH
[ct=6283.847] TIME ESPECIALLY LAST
[ct=6285.196] >> Al: WE’RE GOING TO
[ct=6285.196] FIND OUT PRETTY
[ct=6287.759] UNDER 3 MINUTES TO GO.
[ct=6289.523] HOPKINS GETTING LOOSE
[ct=6290.558] ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=6292.143] 2nd AND 4.
[ct=6294.285] CLEVELAND A TWO
[ct=6295.767] TIMEOUTS.
[ct=6297.105] AND A 2-MINUTE
[ct=6298.478] WARNING.
[ct=6298.478] WINSTON HAVING
[ct=6299.612] TROUBLE, WINSTON HANGS
[ct=6301.801] IN THERE, THROWS,
[ct=6302.493] DROPPED.
[ct=6304.908] THAT IS MANNED.
[ct=6305.627] AKINS COULDN’T HOLD
[ct=6306.271] ON.
[ct=6307.768] 3rd AND 4.
[ct=6308.774] >> Kirk: STEELERS HERE
[ct=6310.925] MAKING A BLUNDER.
[ct=6313.198] QUEEN AND ELLIOTT BOTH
[ct=6315.413] TAKING NJOKU.
[ct=6316.480] NJOKU WORKS HERE AND
[ct=6318.307] YOU’VE GOT TWO
[ct=6318.773] DEFENDERS THAT GO WITH
[ct=6319.790] HIM, SO YOU’VE GOT
[ct=6320.755] NOBODY ON THE OTHER
[ct=6321.531] TIGHT END.
[ct=6322.458] HE’S ALL ALONE.
[ct=6323.092] NOBODY HAS IT.
[ct=6324.265] LOOK AT THE ROOM TO
[ct=6326.292] RUN IF HE CATCHES THAT
[ct=6328.951] NOBODY TOOK AKINS.
[ct=6330.524] >> Al: LOOKED LIKE HE
[ct=6331.705] ALMOST JUMPED A LITTLE
[ct=6333.896] EARLY, TOO.
[ct=6338.840] 3rd DOWN AND 4.
[ct=6341.454] 0-8 ARE THE BROWNS ON
[ct=6351.092] DeSHON ELLIOTT, FOURTH
[ct=6353.607] >> Kirk: THIS IS --
[ct=6354.959] THIS IS WHERE, YOU
[ct=6354.959] KNOW, YOU HAVE THE
[ct=6356.246] PLAY, KEN DORSEY’S
[ct=6357.616] HELD ONTO
[ct=6358.954] THE PLAY YOU FEEL
[ct=6358.954] BASED
[ct=6361.476] THAT YOU KNOW YOU’RE
[ct=6361.476] GOING TO GET THAT
[ct=6365.494] GOING TO GET BACK OUT
[ct=6366.742] AND IF IT’S MANNED
[ct=6369.439] COVERAGE MAYBE
[ct=6372.082] CROSSES, RUSH ROUTES
[ct=6373.546] UNDERNEATH, MAYBE TRY
[ct=6374.891] TO PICK.
[ct=6376.237] >> Al: 3 FOR 3 ON
[ct=6378.902] HERE THEY ARE AGAIN.
[ct=6378.902] >> Kirk: IT’S BEEN
[ct=6381.436] QUIET NIGHT FOR THIS
[ct=6381.436] MAN BECAUSE OF THE
[ct=6384.019] DOUBLE-TEAM, BECAUSE
[ct=6385.402] OF THE CHIPS.
[ct=6386.854] >> Al: AGAIN, PASS IS
[ct=6386.854] A LITTLE LOW.
[ct=6388.184] THAT’S CAUGHT.
[ct=6390.446] JERRY JEUDY WAS RIGHT
[ct=6393.105] >> Kirk: WHAT A JOB.
[ct=6394.440] WE JUST SAID USE THE
[ct=6394.440] KICK, USE A
[ct=6397.024] ANYTHING YOU CAN DO.
[ct=6398.428] THAT’S WHAT JEUDY USES
[ct=6399.863] WITH NJOKU.
[ct=6399.863] MANNED COVERAGE, AND
[ct=6401.265] WATCH HOW HE USES THE
[ct=6403.959] BIG FELLA ALMOST
[ct=6405.297] INSTEAD JUST OF
[ct=6405.297] SCREEN, GET IN FRONT
[ct=6407.776] OF HIM, USE THE BIG
[ct=6409.219] MAN TO HELP HIM OUT,
[ct=6410.619] GET THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=6411.968] >> Al: PASS TO THE
[ct=6411.968] OUTSIDE HERE, AND
[ct=6414.399] THAT’LL BE CAUGHT BY
[ct=6417.342] JORDAN AKINS.
[ct=6417.342] AND THAT WILL MAKE
[ct=6418.603] 2nd DOWN.
[ct=6419.751] THEY’RE GOING TO TRY
[ct=6419.751] TO GO WITHOUT A
[ct=6422.471] HUDDLE, BUT THEY STOP
[ct=6425.132] >> Kirk: HOW ABOUT HIM
[ct=6426.486] NOT ONLY MAKING THE
[ct=6426.486] CATCH BUT STAYING
[ct=6429.153] INBOUNDS?
[ct=6429.153] I MEAN EVERY YARD
[ct=6430.453] COUNTS RIGHT NOW,
[ct=6430.453] RIGHT?
[ct=6431.696] AND JUST GETTING
[ct=6433.086] CLOSER TO THIS FIELD
[ct=6435.757] GOAL FOR HOPKINS.
[ct=6435.757] >> Al: INSIDE 5
[ct=6438.410] MINUTES.
[ct=6441.126] STOPPED AT 2:05 AS HE
[ct=6442.447] WENT OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=6450.162] 2nd DOWN AND 2.
[ct=6452.903] NEEDING 2, GETTI KNOWS?
[ct=6454.210] >> Kirk: HE’S BEEN
[ct=6454.316] PRETTY GOOD EVEN THIS
[ct=6458.422] YEAR IN THAT 40 TO 49
[ct=6459.742] RANGE.
[ct=6462.439] THIS YEAR BEYOND 50 IS
[ct=6463.686] WHERE HE’S
[ct=6465.041] >> Al: NOTHING IS FOR
[ct=6466.074] CERTAIN RIGHT NOW.
[ct=6467.389] THAT PICTURE SAYS IT
[ct=6467.389] ALL.
[ct=6468.651] >> Kirk: THE SNAP
[ct=6470.083] ALONE, RIGHT?
[ct=6472.824] >> Al: 3rd DOWN AND 2.
[ct=6475.391] 0 FOR 9 ON THIRD DOWN.
[ct=6476.742] CAN THEY CONVERT HERE?
[ct=6476.742] LOOK OUT, UNDER
[ct=6479.442] FIRES, AND THAT IS
[ct=6483.342] INCOMPLETE THAT TIME.
[ct=6484.688] THAT TIME QUEEN HAD A
[ct=6487.342] FREE SHOT AT HIM.
[ct=6488.760] SO IT’S 4th DOWN AND
[ct=6490.211] 2.
[ct=6490.211] >> Kirk: YEAH, REALLY
[ct=6491.586] GOOD DEFENSE HERE.
[ct=6492.873] THEY’RE GOING TO TAKE
[ct=6493.936] A LOOK AT THIS.
[ct=6495.320] DID WINSTON JUST TRY
[ct=6495.320] TO GET RID OF THE
[ct=6496.561] FOOTBALL?
[ct=6496.561] THERE WEREN’T ANY
[ct=6497.876] RECEIVERS ANYWHERE
[ct=6499.243] THERE WERE JUST
[ct=6500.547] OFFENSIVE LINEMEN.
[ct=6501.840] CAN YOU IMAGINE THIS
[ct=6501.840] WAS INTENTIONAL
[ct=6503.193] GROUNDING AND THEY
[ct=6503.193] MOVE THIS
[ct=6505.903] >> Al: TAKE THEM OUT
[ct=6507.252] OF FIELD GOAL RANGE.
[ct=6507.252] THIS WEATHER YOU’RE ON
[ct=6508.514] THE CUSP.
[ct=6511.146] YOU’RE 43-YARD FIELD
[ct=6512.495] GOAL, WHICH WOULD BE A
[ct=6513.841] 58-YARD FIELD GOAL IF
[ct=6515.231] THEY CALL AN
[ct=6515.231] INTENTIONAL GROUNDING.
[ct=6516.326] SO HERE WE ARE.
[ct=6520.428] MAKE THE CALL.
[ct=6521.772] CROWD, OF COURSE, IS
[ct=6523.841] ALREADY MAKING THE
[ct=6529.463] THE OFFICIAL WORD.
[ct=6529.463] >> Kirk: YEAH, THERE’S
[ct=6530.745] NO RECEIVER IN THE
[ct=6532.079] THE BALL DIDN’T EVEN
[ct=6533.383] GET PAST THE LINE OF
[ct=6536.391] >> Al: A LITTLE ASSIST
[ct=6540.587] FROM UPSTAIRS.
[ct=6542.056] ALL RIGHT, TERRY, YOU
[ct=6543.602] WANT TO WEIGH IN
[ct=6544.931] >> YEAH, HE’S
[ct=6544.931] CERTAINLY IN THE
[ct=6545.938] POCKET.
[ct=6545.938] THERE’S NO RECEIVE
[ct=6548.896] THE ONLY ISSUE WOULD
[ct=6550.293] BE IT LOOKS LIKE HE
[ct=6552.559] STARTS HIS MOTION --
[ct=6554.139] >> Referee: ILLEGAL
[ct=6555.489] TOUCHING OF A PASS
[ct=6558.022] OFFENSE NUMBER 55.
[ct=6559.446] IT’S A 5-YARD PEN
[ct=6560.846] REMAINS THIRD DOWN.
[ct=6562.217] >> Kirk: SO YOU’RE
[ct=6563.612] SAYING HE GOT HIT AS
[ct=6563.868] HE WAS STARTING TO
[ct=6565.994] THROW THE FOOTBALL?
[ct=6565.994] >>> EXACTLY,
[ct=6567.382] THAT’S WHY IT’S NOT
[ct=6569.870] BUT APPARENTLY A
[ct=6569.870] LINEMEN INTENTIONALLY
[ct=6571.265] TOUCHED THE FOOTBALL,
[ct=6572.454] TOUCHED THE PASS,
[ct=6574.139] WHICH IS A 5-YARD
[ct=6575.509] PENALTY.
[ct=6576.618] >> Al: EVEN CLOSER.
[ct=6578.101] >> Kirk: IT WOULD HAVE
[ct=6578.101] BEEN INTERESTING TO
[ct=6579.121] SEE WHERE THAT BALL
[ct=6582.592] WOULD HAVE GUN IF HE
[ct=6584.154] HADN’T BEEN HIT.
[ct=6585.497] BUT ANYWAY THEY WAVE
[ct=6587.635] IT OFF.
[ct=6588.932] >> Al: MEANWHILE, BRAD
[ct=6590.479] ALLEN COMING OVER TO
[ct=6591.714] THE SIDELINE HERE.
[ct=6593.020] FOR THE MOMENT THEY
[ct=6595.678] HAVE AT IT AT THE 25,
[ct=6596.998] BUT HE SAID A 5-YARD
[ct=6599.578] HE’S TALKING TO
[ct=6604.783] TOMLIN.
[ct=6607.391] SO THE ORIGINAL
[ct=6608.739] SCRIMMAGE WAS THE 25.
[ct=6610.035] GOING TO BE 4th DOWN.
[ct=6611.473] WHERE’S THE BALL?
[ct=6615.962] ANNOUNCED THAT
[ct=6617.506] PITTSBURGH DECLINED
[ct=6619.903] THE PENALTY.
[ct=6621.385] >> Al: 4th DOWN.
[ct=6622.621] SO 4th AND 2.
[ct=6622.621] THEY’RE BASICALLY
[ct=6625.215] SAYING, ALL RIGHT, YOU
[ct=6626.191] WANT TO TRY A 43 YARD
[ct=6627.620] FIELD GOAL OR ARE YOU
[ct=6628.008] GOING TO GO FOR IT,
[ct=6629.654] AND THEY’RE GOING TO
[ct=6630.620] GO FOR IT.
[ct=6633.418] MEANWHILE, HOPKINS
[ct=6634.830] >> Kirk: AM I MISSING
[ct=6636.318] YOU GOT A CHANCE TO
[ct=6639.187] WIN THE GAME, RIGHT?
[ct=6640.683] I GUESS IT JUST TELLS
[ct=6640.683] YOU ABOUT THE
[ct=6641.716] CONDITIONS.
[ct=6643.402] >> Al: WELL, YOU STILL
[ct=6644.746] HAVE 1:55.
[ct=6646.055] AND PITTSBURGH --
[ct=6646.055] THERE’S A LOT GOING O
[ct=6648.533] NOW THEY’RE GOING TO
[ct=6651.397] MOVE IT BACK.
[ct=6652.759] SO ORIGINALLY
[ct=6653.786] DECLINED, AND IT’S A
[ct=6655.493] 5-YARD PENALTY.
[ct=6655.493] HANG WITH US, GANG.
[ct=6658.160] WE’RE ALL IN THIS
[ct=6659.185] TOGETHER.
[ct=6659.185] >> Kirk: THEY DECLINED
[ct=6661.740] IT, AND AFTER TALKING
[ct=6664.605] THEY PUSH THEM BACK.
[ct=6664.605] >> Al: TO THE 30.
[ct=6666.086] SO YOUR 5-YARD
[ct=6670.024] IT’S STILL THIRD DOWN.
[ct=6672.468] AND 3rd DOWN AND 7.
[ct=6674.038] READY FOR PLAY.
[ct=6678.019] NOT READY FOR PLAY.
[ct=6682.191] >> Referee: TIME OUT
[ct=6685.066] IT’LL BE 30 SECONDS.
[ct=6688.357] >> Al: WHEELS THEY ARE
[ct=6689.785] SPINNING, AS KEITH
[ct=6692.570] JACKSON MIGHT SAY.
[ct=6699.810] TERRY, THERE WAS A
[ct=6701.102] ON IT FIELD.
[ct=6702.358] WHAT WAS THE END
[ct=6704.021] RESULT?
[ct=6704.021] >> YEAH, ORIGINALLY
[ct=6705.495] THEY DECLINED THE
[ct=6706.072] PENALTY AND THEN THEY
[ct=6706.072] WENT THROUGH ALL OF
[ct=6707.347] THE OPTIONS.
[ct=6707.347] IT’S NOT A LOS
[ct=6710.069] THEY DECIDED TO ACCEPT
[ct=6712.749] THE 5-YARD PENALTY AND
[ct=6716.675] REPEAT THE GAME.
[ct=6716.675] >> Al: OKAY.
[ct=6719.329] SO HOPKINS STILL ON
[ct=6720.446] THE SIDELINE.
[ct=6727.201] BALL AT THE 30.
[ct=6728.908] SNOW HAS BARELY
[ct=6730.446] ABATED.
[ct=6731.708] 3rd AND 7.
[ct=6739.656] IN THE POCKET.
[ct=6742.360] HAS A MAN!
[ct=6743.677] TO THE 13 YARD LINE,
[ct=6749.168] JERRY JEUDY HAS SOME
[ct=6750.064] SIX TACKLES, 87 YARDS
[ct=6751.940] FOR HIM.
[ct=6754.642] HERE WITH MANNED
[ct=6756.720] LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A
[ct=6758.408] FLAG THAT COMES IN
[ct=6759.611] LATE.
[ct=6762.036] JOEY PORTER PASSES IT
[ct=6764.847] OFF TO MINKAH FITZ
[ct=6766.254] PATRICK.
[ct=6767.577] MISCOMMUNICATION BY
[ct=6768.863] BUT A GREAT BALL THERE
[ct=6772.950] BY JAMEIS TO GIVE A
[ct=6774.576] CHANCE.
[ct=6776.222] >> Al: PENALTY ON THE
[ct=6782.805] OH, MAN, BISHOP HITS
[ct=6792.546] JEUDY.
[ct=6795.440] SO ITS A 1st AND GOAL.
[ct=6796.007] GO BACK AND LOOK AT
[ct=6799.018] THAT PLAY IN A SECOND.
[ct=6800.315] NOT SURE THEY TOUCHED
[ct=6800.315] HIM DOWN.
[ct=6801.703] >> Kirk: IF THEY DID
[ct=6805.495] IT WAS WITH A LEG.
[ct=6808.161] >> Al: BARELY.
[ct=6809.559] HERE GOES.
[ct=6812.191] JUST BREAKING TACKLES!
[ct=6818.120] TO THE 1 YARD LINE HE
[ct=6818.120] GOES.
[ct=6822.879] >> Kirk: NOW OF COURSE
[ct=6824.384] CLEVELAND IN NOT ANY
[ct=6824.875] HURRY AT ALL
[ct=6826.156] PITTSBURGH BECAUSE
[ct=6827.305] THEY USED THAT TIMEOUT
[ct=6831.578] BECAUSE THEY HAD A
[ct=6832.959] LATE SUBSSTATITUTION AND
[ct=6833.867] JUST A FEW PLAYS AGO
[ct=6834.800] THEY’RE DOWN TO ONE
[ct=6838.380] TIMEOUT.
[ct=6839.514] >> Al: AND OBVIOUSLY
[ct=6843.488] IF CLEVELAND GETS A
[ct=6847.464] TOUCHDOWN -- SECONDS
[ct=6848.807] TICKING DOWN.
[ct=6849.853] WINSTON FROM THE GUN.
[ct=6851.994] TO THE END ZONE GOES
[ct=6854.295] TOUCHDOWN BROWNS.
[ct=6862.439] LOOK AT THIS CROWD!
[ct=6863.240] NOBODY’S LEFT.
[ct=6872.718] >> Kirk: BROWNS
[ct=6874.218] OBVIOUSLY GOING TO GO
[ct=6879.424] FOR 2 HERE.
[ct=6880.211] I’VE FELT THE PAIN OF
[ct=6881.723] THE BROWNS FANS.
[ct=6884.602] MY FIRST THOUGHT, 57
[ct=6885.648] SECONDS EVEN IF THEY
[ct=6887.263] GO FOR 2 HERE, YOU’RE
[ct=6889.468] GOING TO GET RUSSELL
[ct=6891.440] WILSON WITH A TIMEOUT,
[ct=6892.087] PLENTY OF TIME TO WORK
[ct=6894.442] >> Al: THEY’LL HAVE
[ct=6895.437] ONE TIMEOUT.
[ct=6896.164] THEY’LL HAVE
[ct=6898.034] WHATEVER’S LEFT OF THE
[ct=6898.243] CLOCK.
[ct=6899.377] AS FOR THE KICK THEY
[ct=6900.684] GO FOR 2 TO TRY TO
[ct=6903.692] MAKE IT A 7-POINT
[ct=6907.846] WELL, YOU’VE GOT CHUBB
[ct=6908.920] LINED UP IN THE
[ct=6911.991] BACKFIELD AS THE
[ct=6912.344] TAILBACK.
[ct=6913.041] >> Referee: FALSE
[ct=6914.346] START OFFENSE NUMBER
[ct=6915.860] 59.
[ct=6919.071] >> Kirk: SO HARD TO DO
[ct=6919.786] THE COUNT DOWN IN
[ct=6923.947] >> Al: WIN STON REED IS
[ct=6925.445] THE DEFENSIVE PLAYER.
[ct=6926.365] THEY PUT HIM DOWN AS
[ct=6928.259] THE FULL BACK.
[ct=6930.559] AND HE FLINCHES.
[ct=6932.298] NOW YOU’RE IN THE SAME
[ct=6933.449] SITUATION BASICALLY
[ct=6934.257] EVEN THOUGH YOU’RE
[ct=6934.958] MOVING IT BACK.
[ct=6936.022] >> Kirk: YEAH, CHANGE
[ct=6936.957] OF PERSONNEL
[ct=6938.350] GROUPINGS, GIVE IT A
[ct=6940.797] BIT MORE SPREAD LOOK.
[ct=6941.182] >> Al: STILL NEED 2 TO
[ct=6942.963] MAKE IT 7.
[ct=6953.021] CHUBB COMES OUT.
[ct=6954.366] JEUDY’S HAD BIG, BIG
[ct=6955.417] MONEY.
[ct=6957.097] HE’S WIDE RIGHT.
[ct=6958.791] NOW HE GOES INTO
[ct=6959.370] MOTION.
[ct=6960.731] HE GETS STACKED ON THE
[ct=6961.947] LEFT SIDE.
[ct=6964.770] WINSTON THROWING
[ct=6966.171] TOWARDS JEUDY.
[ct=6967.441] BROKEN UP.
[ct=6970.438] ELLIOTT IN THE END
[ct=6978.158] WHAT A CRAZY GAME.
[ct=6979.467] >> Kirk: RUSSELL
[ct=6983.751] WILSON’S GOT 57
[ct=6985.044] SECONDS AND A TIMEOUT.
[ct=6987.024] YOU KNOW THIS BALL IS
[ct=6987.391] GOING ACROSS MIDFIELD
[ct=6988.168] AND WE’RE ALL GOING TO
[ct=6989.417] BE HOLDING ON FOR DEAR
[ct=6990.492] LIFE TO SEE HOW THIS
[ct=6991.889] THING’S GOING TO END.
[ct=6993.515] WHAT A JOB WINSTON AND
[ct=6995.795] JEUDY AND DONE THIS
[ct=7000.727] JEUDY HAD SUCH A GREAT
[ct=7003.342] DID HE TOUCH HIM WITH
[ct=7003.342] HIS LEFT LEG?
[ct=7006.175] LOOKED LIKE HE MAYBE
[ct=7007.502] DID.
[ct=7008.090] >> Al: THIS IS TOO
[ct=7009.013] MUCH FUN.
[ct=7010.237] >> Kirk: MAN, IT’S SO
[ct=7012.228] GOOD TO SEE 24 IN A
[ct=7013.664] BROWNS UNIFORM RUNNING
[ct=7014.599] HARD AFTER EVERYTHING
[ct=7015.242] HE’S BEEN THROUGH, THE
[ct=7016.862] REHAB HAT HE WORKED SO
[ct=7017.658] HARD FOR 14 MONTHS TO
[ct=7020.331] GET BACK IN AND SCORES
[ct=7021.658] TWO TOUCHDOWNS
[ct=7024.268] THERE’S A 2-POINTER,
[ct=7025.634] UNABLE TO COME UP WITH
[ct=7026.458] BUT THEY STILL HAVE
[ct=7030.067] THE 5-POINT LEAD.
[ct=7032.748] >> Al: CHUBB’S
[ct=7034.465] AVERAGING LESS THAN 3
[ct=7036.739] YARDS A CARRY, STILL
[ct=7038.000] THOSE BIG TDs.
[ct=7038.604] THREE SACKS FOR GARRET
[ct=7044.737] IN THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=7046.307] SO WHAT MAGIC REMAINS?
[ct=7047.584] WILSON’S HAD A GREAT
[ct=7056.042] NIGHT, 18-22 FOR 240.
[ct=7056.982] TALKED ABOUT LAST TIME
[ct=7059.601] WE WERE HERE JOE
[ct=7059.865] FLACKO CAME OUT OF
[ct=7060.317] RETIREMENT TO LEAD
[ct=7061.637] THEM TO THE PLAYOFFS
[ct=7062.611] IN A WIN OVER THE JETS
[ct=7063.592] ON A THURSDAY NIGHT.
[ct=7065.645] THIS YEAR IT’S JAMEIS
[ct=7067.223] WINSTON, AGAIN, WITH
[ct=7067.994] WASHINGTON GETTING
[ct=7068.219] HURT.
[ct=7068.937] COULD BE ONE OF THE
[ct=7070.795] BIG HEROES TONIGHT IF
[ct=7079.817] FAY HOLD ON.
[ct=7080.564] THIS IS WHEN THE
[ct=7082.452] ANNOUNCER WILL SAY
[ct=7083.541] THANK YOU FOR COMING
[ct=7084.853] AND DRIVE CAREFULLY ON
[ct=7085.864] YOUR WAY HOME TONIGHT,
[ct=7086.351] AND HE’LL MEAN IT.
[ct=7101.353] HOPKINS.
[ct=7102.258] RETURNABLE FROM THE
[ct=7104.884] 10.
[ct=7105.673] JAYLEN WARREN.
[ct=7106.966] AND HE WILL WORK HIS
[ct=7110.511] WAY BACK OUT TO THE
[ct=7110.808] ABOUT THE 35.
[ct=7111.457] MEANWHILE, WE CAN TELL
[ct=7112.471] YOU RIGHT AFTER THE
[ct=7114.732] GAME THE JC PENNEY
[ct=7115.358] POSTGAME SHOW WITH
[ct=7117.445] CHARISSA AND THE GANG
[ct=7118.407] EXCLUSIVELY ON PRIME
[ct=7120.073] VIDEO.
[ct=7120.453] KAYLEE WITH THE STAR
[ct=7121.442] OF THE GAME.
[ct=7124.557] A LOT OF STUFF TO TALK
[ct=7124.713] ABOUT TONIGHT.
[ct=7127.210] A LOT OF STUFF.
[ct=7127.210] >> Kirk: BUT WHAT’S
[ct=7128.902] GREAT HERE IN THESE
[ct=7129.754] LAST 50 SECONDS IS
[ct=7130.421] YOU’VE GOT A
[ct=7131.227] QUARTERBACK LIKE
[ct=7131.819] RUSSELL WILSON.
[ct=7133.063] HE KNOWS WHERE HE
[ct=7133.940] WANTS TO A FIND A
[ct=7134.854] MATCHUP.
[ct=7135.457] SO YOU’VE GOT MYLES
[ct=7136.424] GARRET WHO’S GOING TO
[ct=7137.655] BE IN A SPRINTER
[ct=7138.592] STANCE TO TRY TO GET
[ct=7139.408] AFTER HIM.
[ct=7140.678] HE’S ALREADY HAD A BIG
[ct=7141.636] NIGHT WITH A NUMBER OF
[ct=7142.476] SACKS.
[ct=7144.258] WHAT CAN PITTSBURGH
[ct=7145.641] DO?
[ct=7145.813] BACK THERE LOOKS LIKE
[ct=7147.605] TO TRY TO HELP DAN
[ct=7149.746] MOORE OUT ON THAT LEFT
[ct=7155.066] >> Al: CAN HE GO 54
[ct=7158.759] YARDS IN 60 SECONDS.
[ct=7162.706] RUSHED AND AT THE 38
[ct=7165.946] SHOULD BE A FIRST DOWN
[ct=7168.307] OR CLOSE TO IT.
[ct=7171.239] WILSON, AGAIN, BEEN IN
[ct=7172.606] THESE SITUATIONS A
[ct=7174.355] MILLION TIMES.
[ct=7176.947] REALIZES THE URGENCY.
[ct=7179.235] >> Al: TRY TO GET IN
[ct=7179.411] POSITION TO THROW A
[ct=7180.090] HAIL MARY IF NOTHING
[ct=7180.739] ELSE.
[ct=7181.514] ON THE MOVE.
[ct=7186.011] WARREN THE INTENDED
[ct=7186.626] RECEIVER IN A MANNER
[ct=7190.270] OF SPEAKING.
[ct=7193.192] ISAIAH McGUIRE PUT THE
[ct=7195.474] HEAT ON.
[ct=7195.474] >> Kirk: NOBODY WORKED
[ct=7196.312] WITH HIM.
[ct=7196.942] HE WAS RUNNING THAT
[ct=7197.849] TIME AND LOOKED LIKE
[ct=7198.735] PICKENS WAS JUST KIND
[ct=7200.207] OF STOPPED ONCE HE SAW
[ct=7202.250] SCRAMBLING.
[ct=7202.990] SO NOBODY HELPING HIM
[ct=7204.353] ON THAT SCRAMBLE.
[ct=7205.153] ALL HE COULD DO WAS
[ct=7207.785] THROW IT AWAY.
[ct=7211.144] >> Al: STILL 3rd AND
[ct=7213.754] 1.
[ct=7214.216] ONE SECOND MORE BACK
[ct=7217.642] ON THE CLOCK.
[ct=7222.979] IT’S AT THE 23.
[ct=7224.300] A JUMP PASS.
[ct=7224.974] WARREN, AND NOW THEY
[ct=7226.477] HAVE TO TAKE A TIMEOUT
[ct=7227.301] WITH 16 SECONDS.
[ct=7231.227] HE GETS THE FIRST
[ct=7232.524] >> Referee: TIMEOUT
[ct=7234.406] THEIR THIRD AND FINAL.
[ct=7238.150] >> Al: 30-SECOND
[ct=7240.023] SCHWARTZ’S DEFENSE,
[ct=7242.194] CAN THEY HOLD?
[ct=7242.730] >> Kirk: YOU HAVE 16
[ct=7243.321] SECONDS AND OBVIOUSLY
[ct=7245.681] PICKENS IS YOUR MAIN
[ct=7246.249] VERTICAL THREAT
[ct=7248.377] YOU SAW CALVIN AUSTIN
[ct=7250.460] MAKE A PLAY AS WELL.
[ct=7250.695] MIKE WILLIAMS, WHO’S
[ct=7252.751] NOT 100% A FEW WEEKS
[ct=7253.521] AGO AGAINST THE
[ct=7254.304] COMMANDERS MADE A
[ct=7254.796] CATCH LATE.
[ct=7255.487] HE’S COMING OFF
[ct=7258.350] FIELD RIGHT NOW.
[ct=7259.616] BUT THE BIG THING IS I
[ct=7260.771] DON’T KNOW IF I GO
[ct=7261.717] INTO HAIL MARY MODE
[ct=7262.465] RIGHT NOW.
[ct=7263.522] I STILL THINK WITH
[ct=7264.469] VETERAN QUARTERBACKS
[ct=7265.296] LIKE THIS, YOU GET A
[ct=7266.378] CROSSER, SOMETHING
[ct=7267.492] WHERE YOU CAN PICK UP
[ct=7269.199] 10 TO 20 YARDS NEAR
[ct=7270.172] THE BOUNDARY TO GET
[ct=7271.126] OUT OF BOUNDS OR GET
[ct=7271.923] UP TO THE BALL AND
[ct=7272.985] SPIKE IT INTO THE
[ct=7274.678] GROUND.
[ct=7278.342] >> Al: REAL QUICKLY.
[ct=7280.076] WITH 16 YOU CAN DO
[ct=7280.301] EITHER.
[ct=7280.965] SO THE BALL IS AT THE
[ct=7286.726] 44 OF THE BROWNS.
[ct=7289.070] YOU’VE GOT THREE
[ct=7293.049] RECEIVERS TO THE RIGHT
[ct=7298.551] WILSON DANCING, THROWS
[ct=7300.024] THAT ONE AWAY.
[ct=7301.389] NOW YOU’VE GOT 10
[ct=7304.695] SECONDS.
[ct=7305.193] NOW YOU’RE REALLY
[ct=7306.694] COMPELLED TO GET THE
[ct=7307.654] GUY OUT OF BOUNDS OR
[ct=7308.849] DO YOUR HAIL MARY ACT
[ct=7310.051] RIGHT HERE.
[ct=7313.844] RUSHING 4, AND BEING
[ct=7314.885] ABLE TO GET THAT KIND
[ct=7316.840] OF PRESSURE ON A
[ct=7317.439] QUARTERBACK IN THIS
[ct=7318.763] MOMENT IN THE GAME.
[ct=7319.594] YOU WOULD THINK
[ct=7321.032] RUSHING FORWARD, HE’D
[ct=7322.509] BE BACK THERE IN ALL
[ct=7324.464] KINDS OF TIME
[ct=7325.108] ESPECIALLY IN THESE
[ct=7325.775] MYLES GARRET WITH A
[ct=7333.780] SPIN MOVE GOT INTO IT.
[ct=7334.281] >> Al: 10 SECONDS,
[ct=7336.786] WHISTLES.
[ct=7341.732] >> Al: YEAH, TIMEOUT
[ct=7343.026] >> Kirk: WHAT WAS THAT
[ct=7344.506] YEAR?
[ct=7347.258] 2012, THE MONDAY NIGHT
[ct=7351.224] FOOTBALL THE HAIL MARY
[ct=7353.841] AGAINST THE PACKERS.
[ct=7355.479] >> Al: RUSSELL’S BEEN
[ct=7358.766] INVOLVED IN SOME --
[ct=7359.926] BUT A GREAT CAREER.
[ct=7360.923] WHAT’S HE GOT IN STORE
[ct=7361.659] TONIGHT?
[ct=7362.521] NEXT WEEK FRIDAY,
[ct=7364.605] RAIDERS, CHIEFS ON
[ct=7367.006] DAY GAME, 3:00
[ct=7367.960] EASTERN, NOON PACIFIC.
[ct=7383.162] LOOKING TO GET HIS
[ct=7383.162] SAFETIES OBVIOUSLY WAY
[ct=7385.833] HE’S GOING TO CONTINUE
[ct=7389.900] TO RUSH THE 4.
[ct=7393.889] RODNEY McLEOD IS BACK
[ct=7396.467] DEEP.
[ct=7399.596] >> Al: FOUR-MAN RUSH
[ct=7402.389] WILSON HAS TO GO OUT
[ct=7404.717] AND THAT IS CAUGHT.
[ct=7406.030] SO AUSTIN MAKES THAT
[ct=7406.569] CATCH.
[ct=7407.277] NOW YOU HAVE 6
[ct=7409.537] >> Kirk: THAT TOOK 4
[ct=7411.431] SECONDS, SO IF
[ct=7414.466] CLEVELAND PLAYS THE
[ct=7416.033] SAME TYPE OF DEFENSE,
[ct=7416.376] YOU COULD
[ct=7417.846] THEORETICALLY TRY TO
[ct=7418.493] RUN SOMETHING SIMILAR
[ct=7419.175] TO THAT.
[ct=7419.814] TRY TO GET MAYBE
[ct=7424.429] ANOTHER 8 TO 10 YARDS.
[ct=7425.136] THEY DID IT IN 4
[ct=7427.357] >> Al: YEAH, THEY
[ct=7427.716] COULD.
[ct=7432.051] 3rd AND 1.
[ct=7433.819] 6 SECONDS.
[ct=7434.414] >> Kirk: CLEVELAND
[ct=7436.061] GOING TO CALL ANOTHER
[ct=7440.011] >> Referee: THIRD
[ct=7441.322] TIMEOUT, CLEVELAND,
[ct=7443.627] 30 SECONDS.
[ct=7446.940] >> Al: MOVE JORDAN
[ct=7449.793] HICKS INTO A SPOT
[ct=7450.931] AROUND 8 YARDS
[ct=7452.262] THE SAFETY IS VERY
[ct=7455.061] SO THE CLEVELAND
[ct=7456.249] BROWNS TRY TO BECOME
[ct=7460.238] GIANT KILLERS, BEAT
[ct=7468.195] BALTIMORE.
[ct=7473.586] JOHN HARBAUGH AND
[ct=7475.051] COMPANY I’M SURE.
[ct=7478.081] >> Kirk: EVERY GAME,
[ct=7479.471] ONE POSSESSION YOU
[ct=7481.494] NEVER KNOW WHAT’S
[ct=7483.436] GOING TO HAPPEN.
[ct=7484.560] THESE TEAMS SO CLOSE.
[ct=7485.145] IT’S WHO CAN PLAY
[ct=7486.848] CONSISTENTLY.
[ct=7486.848] THAT’S WHAT SEPARATES
[ct=7488.611] THESE TEAMS.
[ct=7489.500] >> Al: EVERYONE KNOWS
[ct=7490.150] NOTHING.
[ct=7501.233] RUSH THREE, DROP
[ct=7502.655] EIGHT, NOW A LATE
[ct=7502.929] RUSH.
[ct=7503.993] THROWING UP FOR GRABS
[ct=7504.777] IN THE END ZONE.
[ct=7507.365] HOW DOES THIS ONE END?
[ct=7517.859] RIGHT DOWN TO THE NUB.
[ct=7519.227] DENZEL WARD, KNOCKS IT
[ct=7521.108] JORDAN HICKS A LATE
[ct=7523.929] RUSH THAT TIME PUT THE
[ct=7524.805] HEAT.
[ct=7524.965] RUSHED THREE
[ct=7530.193] INTENTIONALLY, HICKS
[ct=7532.270] NOW YOU’VE GOT PICKENS
[ct=7533.369] UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING.
[ct=7540.785] THEY PULL HIM AWAY.
[ct=7543.060] JAMEIS WINSTON, TENTH
[ct=7545.506] WHERE DID WINSTON GO?
[ct=7546.465] >> Kirk: HE WENT TO
[ct=7548.322] >> Al: AS THE BACKUP.
[ct=7549.299] HE WAS ACTUALLY NUMBER
[ct=7552.879] 3 QUARTERBACK AT ONE
[ct=7557.158] >> Kirk: THIS DEFENSE
[ct=7558.340] GOT THE PRESSURE MOST
[ct=7559.483] OF THE NIGHT, DID WHAT
[ct=7562.227] THEY HAD TO DO.
[ct=7562.591] THIS TIME THE MOON
[ct=7564.116] BALL, THE INFAMOUS
[ct=7565.480] MOON BALL UP IN THE
[ct=7566.732] AIR.
[ct=7566.900] >> Al: NOW YOU’VE GOT
[ct=7567.906] FOUR STEELERS DOWN
[ct=7570.728] >> Kirk: NONE OF THE
[ct=7571.325] RECEIVERS REALLY IN
[ct=7571.818] POSITION TO HAVE ANY
[ct=7572.548] CHANCE AT ALL.
[ct=7574.023] GOOD JOB BY THE BROWNS
[ct=7574.751] KNOCKING THAT STRAIGHT
[ct=7577.743] >> Al: FOUR RECEIVERS,
[ct=7579.235] SIX DEFENDERS, BUT A
[ct=7580.369] LOSS OF ONE.
[ct=7581.178] AND THERE WAS THAT
[ct=7586.301] LATE MOVE, LEGAL BY
[ct=7589.806] >> Kirk: JIM SCHWARTZ,
[ct=7590.547] MYLES GARRET, WHAT A
[ct=7591.811] NIGHT FOR BOTH OF
[ct=7595.621] THOSE TWO.
[ct=7596.217] >> Al: LIKE YOU SAY
[ct=7599.703] YOU HAVE A TEAM, 2-8.
[ct=7600.441] LINE ON THE GAME IS
[ct=7602.069] RELATIVELY CLOSE, ALL
[ct=7603.037] THINGS CONSIDERED.
[ct=7605.469] AND THE BROWNS PUT ON
[ct=7606.701] A SHOW TONIGHT.
[ct=7608.054] >> Kirk: THE BROWNS
[ct=7609.302] HAVE NOW BEAT THE
[ct=7612.155] STEELERS 5 OF THE LAST
[ct=7613.516] 6 WHEN THEY’VE COME TO
[ct=7614.484] >> Al: TALK ABOUT
[ct=7615.701] DIVISION RIVALRIES AND
[ct=7617.123] ALL THAT GOES WITH IT.
[ct=7618.536] A LOT OF TIMES IT’S A
[ct=7619.912] BUNCH OF HOOEY, BUT
[ct=7621.207] NOT IN THIS
[ct=7621.614] ELPIANTTD,SBUR
