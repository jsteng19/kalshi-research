[ct=8.359] THE DYNAMIC KICKOFF, LAST YEAR,
[ct=8.359] 22% OF THE KICKS WERE RETURNED.
[ct=13.690] I THINK THE LEAK WANTED A LITTLE
[ct=17.691] MORE, THE KICKER IS AT THE 35 IN
[ct=21.714] THE KIC TEAM AT THE OTHER
[ct=21.714] 40.
[ct=25.657] NOBODY CAN TOUCH IT UNLESS IT
[ct=26.991] LANDS IN THE LANDING ZONE.
[ct=29.738] PRETTY MUCH WHAT WE SAW LAST
[ct=31.036] SEASON.
[ct=35.028] TAGOVAILOA, ONE OF THE HIGHEST
[ct=37.670] PAID GUYS IN THE LEAGUE IN HIS
[ct=37.670] FIRST YEAR.
[ct=40.343] JOE BURROW WAS THE NUMBER ONE
[ct=41.711] PICK AND IT CAME DOWN TO
[ct=44.299] TAGOVAILOA OR HERBERT AND THEY
[ct=47.016] WENT BACK TO BACK, MIAMI TOOK
[ct=49.612] TUA INTO THE CHARGERS TOOK
[ct=51.078] HERBERT.
[ct=53.672] LAST YEAR LED THE LEAGUE IN
[ct=53.672] PASSING YARDAGE.
[ct=57.620] CHECKING OUT THE FIRST PLAY
[ct=57.620] HERE.
[ct=67.000] START FROM THE 30 OUT -- 30 YARD
[ct=67.000] LINE.
[ct=71.046] SHORT DROP, QUICK THROW.
[ct=77.637] THREE STRAIGHT FELLS.
[ct=79.058] MAKING THE TACKLE.
[ct=82.895] KIRK: YESTERDAY MIKE MCDANIEL
[ct=86.918] TELLING USTUA HAD A GAME
[ct=88.252] CHANGING OFF-SEASON, CARING
[ct=89.645] HIMSELF IN A DIFFERENT WAY SINCE
[ct=89.645] JANUARY WAS A STRONG STATEMENT.
[ct=93.585] YOU MENTIONED THE NUMBERS HE PUT
[ct=95.016] UP BUT I THINK AS FAR AS
[ct=96.207] MENTAL TOUGHNESS AND BUYING IN
[ct=98.872] AND BECOMING THE GUY FOR THE
[ct=98.872] FRANCHISE, HE’
[ct=101.506] FRANCHISE, HE'S TAKING HUGE
[ct=101.506] STRIDES COMING INTO THIS YEAR.
[ct=104.275] AL: SECOND DOWN THROUGH THE
[ct=113.685] MIDDLE, YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT
[ct=117.617] TUA AND TYREEK HILL SAID LAST
[ct=118.842] WEEK AT HALFTIME, THEY WERE DOWN
[ct=120.259] BY A LOT OF POINTS.
[ct=122.891] HE SAID IT'S THE FIRST TIME I’VE
[ct=124.164] HEARD HIS HAWAIIAN ACCENT.
[ct=126.788] HE SAID I WASN'T EVEN THAT WAY
[ct=128.164] IN HIGH SCHOOL.
[ct=130.874] KIRK: IT SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT
[ct=133.511] WHAT MIKE MCDANIEL IS TALKING
[ct=136.108] ABOUT, HE'S BECOME THE ALPHA AND
[ct=136.108] THE LEADER OF THE
[ct=137.543] OFFENSE.
[ct=141.537] AL: THIRD DOWN AND ONE.
[ct=146.713] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=153.469] KIRK: AFTER ALL THE HYPE AND THE
[ct=154.676] TALK AND THE PERCEPTION OF TUA
[ct=160.053] INTO TYREEK HILL AND THE
[ct=161.316] PRE-SNAP MOTION AND IF YOU TALK
[ct=162.645] TO THE COACHES AND PLAYERS THEY
[ct=164.026] WILL TELL YOU IT STARTS AT THE
[ct=164.026] LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=168.029] THEY PRIDE THEMSELVES ON THE
[ct=169.275] PHYSICALITY AND RUNNING THE BALL
[ct=172.006] TO SET UP EVERY OTHER ASPECT
[ct=173.309] WHERE YOU CAN GET TYREEK HILL
[ct=174.621] AND OTHERS INVOLVED.
[ct=177.366] AL: MOTION HERE WITH JULIAN
[ct=178.643] HILL.
[ct=181.447] TOSSED BACK, GREAT TACKLE IN THE
[ct=181.447] BACKFIELD.
[ct=186.609] THE SECOND TACKLE OF THE NIGHT
[ct=186.609] FOR A LOSS THERE.
[ct=190.563] KIRK: HE HAS THE BODY OF A
[ct=193.200] SAFETY, HE CAME OVER LAST YEAR
[ct=195.940] FROM BRADEN BAY IN LATE OCTO
[ct=197.259] AND YOU CAN SEE HE IS A GUY ABLE
[ct=198.527] TO GET AWAY FROM BLOCKS.
[ct=202.654] GOES INSIDE, FREES UP DOUGLAS TO
[ct=203.876] MAKE THAT PLAY.
[ct=207.920] LOSS OF YARDAGE, VERY IMPORTANT
[ct=210.550] TO MIAMI WITH THIS OFFENSIVE
[ct=210.550] LINE AGAINST THE BILLS, TO STAY
[ct=213.221] THE STICKS.
[ct=217.100] AL: SECOND AND 13 M OF THE SAME
[ct=221.160] FORMATION, SPIN AROUND, DEEP
[ct=221.160] DOWNFIELD.
[ct=229.106] TYREEK HILL HAD AN 80 YARD
[ct=229.106] TOUCHDOWN RECEPTION LAST WEEK.
[ct=233.092] CHRISTIAN BENFORD SET UP A THIRD
[ct=233.092] DOWN.
[ct=238.454] KIRK: THE BILLS'S CORNERS ARE
[ct=239.670] THE FASTEST, THEY ARE BIGGER.
[ct=243.694] HE'S ANTICIPATING THE SHOT SO HE
[ct=243.694] IS SEVEN YARDS OUT IN FRONT.
[ct=247.713] FIRST COUPLE PLAYS THEY HAD TWO
[ct=249.115] SAFETIES BACK, THAT TIME ONLY
[ct=251.701] ONE SAFETY, BUT ALSO GREAT JOB
[ct=254.389] JUST IN CASE THEY TOOK THE SHOT.
[ct=262.323] AL: MISSING JOHNSON, THE SAFETY,
[ct=262.323] INACTIVE TONIGHT.
[ct=266.447] THE DEFLECTION.
[ct=270.328] THE BILLS HAVE IT FOR THE 36
[ct=270.328] YARD LINE.
[ct=273.052] DEMARCUS INGRAM.
[ct=279.698] INTENDED THAT TIME FOR GRANT
[ct=281.012] DUBOSE.
[ct=285.012] EARLY TURNOVER SETS UP THE
[ct=286.303] BILLS.
[ct=291.704] KIRK: DUBOSE CAME OVER RECENTLY
[ct=293.051] IN THE TIMING IS OFF, HE'S NOT
[ct=294.291] READY FOR THIS FOOTBALL.
[ct=298.324] TUA DOES A GREAT JOB LOOKING
[ct=298.324] BACK, INTO THE WINDOW AND ON THE
[ct=302.274] MONEY AND I DON'T KNOW IF HE GOT
[ct=304.965] A HAND ON THAT FOOTBALL ERROR --
[ct=306.167] FOOTBALL OR DEBOSE WAS NOT READY
[ct=306.167] FOR IT.
[ct=308.985] RIGHT OFF THE SHOULDER PAD.
[ct=312.867] THE BILLS GET THE FIRST TURNOVER
[ct=314.153] OF THE GAME TO GIVE JOSH
[ct=315.555] PLUS TERRITORY.
[ct=318.217] AL: FIRST CAREER INTERCEPTION.
[ct=322.209] QUICK THROW OUTSIDE.
[ct=327.479] FINDING HIS WAY IS DALTON
[ct=328.808] KINCAID, THE TIGHT END.
[ct=332.857] JOSH ALLEN, TWO PASSING
[ct=335.441] TOUCHDOWNS, TWO BRUSHING
[ct=339.411] TOUCHDOWNS -- TWO RUSHING
[ct=339.411] TOUCHDOWNS LAST WEEK.
[ct=343.448] HE INJURED HIS HAND, YOU CAN SEE
[ct=343.448] HE IS WEARING A GLOVE.
[ct=346.044] HE STAYED IN THE GAME LAST WEEK
[ct=347.404] AND HE SAYS HE'S FINE.
[ct=353.968] SECOND AND 1.
[ct=358.100] INSIDE THE 24 YARD LINE, STOPP
[ct=359.332] BY KENDALL FULLER, NOW IN HIS
[ct=359.332] NINTH SEASON.
[ct=363.285] KIRK: THE GLOVE AND YOU CAN S
[ct=364.647] THE TWO MIDDLE FINGERS TAPED
[ct=364.647] TOGETHER.
[ct=367.302] WHAT SURPRISED ME IS THE SIZE OF
[ct=371.378] THE GLOVE, THAT'S NOT A RECEIVER
[ct=372.602] GLOVE, YOU CAN SEE THE PADDING,
[ct=373.883] ALMOST LIKE A LINEBACKER
[ct=375.301] WHERE THAT TYPE OF GLOVE.
[ct=377.891] IT IS PROTECTED AND TAKING CARE
[ct=377.891] OF.
[ct=381.868] AL: GOOD THROW AGAIN, TO THE
[ct=385.855] RIGHT SIDE, KINCAID WASN'T USED
[ct=385.855] A LOT LAST WEEK BUT THIS IS A
[ct=388.500] TEAM WITH KINCAID AND THEY ALSO
[ct=389.873] HAVE AUSTIN KNOX.
[ct=393.824] KIRK: A LOT OF 12 PERSONNEL WITH
[ct=399.182] ONE RUNNING BACK TWO TIGHT END
[ct=400.461] HE CAN GET OUT WIDE AND MAKE
[ct=400.461] PLAYS.
[ct=404.641] IT'S LIKE HE TOOK A KNEE TO THE
[ct=408.546] HEAD AFTER HE WAS DOWN.
[ct=412.560] AL: SECOND DOWN AND 2.
[ct=415.189] THE FAKE, THE ROLE COME OF THE
[ct=416.532] THROW INCOMPLETE.
[ct=419.183] THIRD DOWN AND 2.
[ct=421.814] BECCA JOSH ALLEN.
[ct=427.102] I THINK EVERY WEEK WE WILL HAVE
[ct=427.102] SOME OF THE HIGHEST PAID
[ct=428.598] QUARTERBACKS IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=432.507] DAK PRESCOTT AFTER LAST WEEK.
[ct=436.493] KIRK: HE'S BEEN THE FACE OF THIS
[ct=437.761] FRANCHISE FOR A LONG TIME BUT
[ct=440.438] WITH THE MOVES, SEAN MCDERMOTT
[ct=443.192] IS LOOKING FOR HIM, ALMOST A NEW
[ct=444.384] CHAPTER FOR HIM TAKING OVER.
[ct=448.421] AL: THIRD DOWN, THEY BRING IN
[ct=451.093] JOHNSON AS THE THIRD DOWN BACK.
[ct=453.771] LOOK OUT.
[ct=457.688] THAT IS DAVID LONG JUNIOR.
[ct=461.734] STOPS IN THE BACKFIELD, FOURTH
[ct=468.320] KIRK: LOOKS LIKE THEY WILL GO
[ct=469.624] FOR THIS, A PERFECTLY TIMED
[ct=471.028] BLITZ, GOOD CALL.
[ct=475.090] AL: ANTHONY WEAVER IS THE NEW
[ct=475.090] DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR.
[ct=481.673] THE CROWD AT FULL DECIBEL RIGHT
[ct=483.036] NOW AT FOURTH DOWN AND 3.
[ct=485.692] AT LEAST THEY WILL LINE UP TO GO
[ct=488.288] BACK IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=492.285] CURTIS SAMUEL AS WELL.
[ct=496.320] ALAN TOOK A LOOK AT THE DEFENSE
[ct=496.320] AND CALLS A TIMEOUT.
[ct=500.251] THAT WILL BRING IN THE FIELD
[ct=501.577] GOAL.
[ct=512.182] KIRK: TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH
[ct=516.221] COMMAND HE HAS TAKING OVER AND
[ct=518.868] HAVING TO REBUILD THE OFFENSE,
[ct=518.868] BASICALLY AN ENTIRE NEW ROOM OF
[ct=522.821] WIDE RECEIVERS, THE TIGHT ENDS
[ct=525.567] WILL BE HEAVILY INVOLVED TONIGHT
[ct=526.865] AND ALL YEAR, BUT HIS CAREER, WE
[ct=529.571] TALKED ALL WEEK ABOUT WHAT HE'S
[ct=530.931] DONE, NOT JUST THE WINS AND
[ct=534.802] LOSSES, 11 AND 2, BUT HIS
[ct=536.097] NUMBERS.
[ct=540.074] THIS IS THE TEAM HE IS PROBABLY
[ct=541.424] PERFORMED THE BEST AGAINST AND
[ct=542.891] JOE BRADY HAS HAD AN ENTIRE
[ct=545.451] OFF-SEASON, HE TOOK OVER FOR KEN
[ct=545.451] DORSEY LAST YEAR AS THE
[ct=546.701] OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, TO GET
[ct=548.102] THIS OFFENSE READY TO GO THIS
[ct=549.357] YEAR.
[ct=552.058] AL: HE WILL LIMIT MORE
[ct=554.756] JOSH ALLEN IS ALWAYS A THREAT TO
[ct=554.756] RUN.
[ct=563.996] BACK AND FORTH AND GETS SET.
[ct=566.666] WIDE OPEN, INSIDE THE 10.
[ct=571.975] JAMES COOK TAKES IT IN.
[ct=579.972] WE GO FOR IT AT FOURTH DOWN, A
[ct=583.454] LOT OF MOTION, FINDS
[ct=585.282] WIDE-OPEN.
[ct=587.933] KIRK: MIAMI WAS SOME OF THEIR
[ct=591.915] OWN MEDICINE, COOK HERE GETS
[ct=593.625] CAUGHT UP IN THE TRAFFIC WHAT A
[ct=595.002] GREAT CALL BY JOE BRADY.
[ct=600.164] ANTICIPATING IT ON FOURTH DOWN,
[ct=603.855] GETS TO THAT MESH TO GET THE
[ct=605.244] BACK OUT OF THE BACKFIELD, THE
[ct=607.032] TWO RECEIVERS DO A GOOD JOB OF
[ct=607.749] LOOKING LIKE THEY'RE NOT
[ct=610.730] RECEIVING THAT PICK, TOO MUCH
[ct=610.730] TRAFFIC FOR DAVID LONG TO GET
[ct=610.945] THROUGH.
[ct=616.529] AL: THEY GO 37 YARDS AND SIX
[ct=618.287] PLAYS INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=621.594] AFTER THAT PICK GOES COOK.
[ct=625.437] 7-0 BUFFALO.
[ct=627.117] HOT DAY.
[ct=629.588] A LOT OF RAIN YESTERDAY.
[ct=635.949] THIS KICKOFF WILL RESULT IN
[ct=635.949] ANOTHER TOUCHBACK.
[ct=638.154] 2-2 ON TOUCHBACKS.
[ct=641.281] THEY COME OUT TO THE 30 YARD
[ct=645.284] KIRK: SOMETHING TO KEEP AN EYE
[ct=645.284] ON.
[ct=650.812] THE RED ORBS YOU SEE AS
[ct=651.073] DEFENSIVE ALERTS.
[ct=654.550] IT IS NOT NECESSARILY PREDICTING
[ct=657.376] WHO WILL BLITZ BUT ALERTING WHO
[ct=659.063] LOOKS UNUSUAL AS A THREAT TO
[ct=659.629] MAYBE COME AFTER THE QUARTERBACK
[ct=662.616] WITH THE HELP OF AI, WE GET IN
[ct=665.757] THE MINDS OF THE QUARTERBACKS
[ct=667.037] AND IDENTIFY THE POTENTIAL
[ct=667.552] BLITZERS.
[ct=668.424] A COOL THING.
[ct=671.853] AL: AI IS GOING TO GET INTO OUR
[ct=671.853] BRAINS.
[ct=672.179] [LAUGHTER]
[ct=680.339] PRESSURE, THROWS INTO TRAFFIC.
[ct=683.222] GETTING AWAY THAT TIME IS JONNU
[ct=685.616] SMITH TO THE 45 YARD LINE.
[ct=687.726] DID NOT DO MUCH LAST WEEK.
[ct=690.498] THEY WANT TO USE HIM MORE IF
[ct=690.811] POSSIBLE.
[ct=692.812] IN HIS EIGHTH YEAR.
[ct=695.756] ONE CATCH LAST WEEK AGAINST
[ct=696.033] JACKSONVILLE.
[ct=699.240] KIRK: A GROWING TREND ACROSS THE
[ct=703.220] NFL IS DEFENSES PUTTING TWO
[ct=703.511] SAFETIES BACK.
[ct=706.434] WE SAW THAT AGAINST PATRICK
[ct=706.742] MAHOMES.
[ct=708.567] HE HAD TO ADJUST.
[ct=710.641] WE ARE SEEING THAT AROUND THE
[ct=710.929] NFL.
[ct=713.883] THAT IS WHY NUMBERS ARE DOWN FOR
[ct=713.883] QUARTERBACKS.
[ct=717.861] IT FORCES YOU TO BE PATIENT
[ct=719.158] YOU HAVE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=723.128] AL: YOU HAVE WADDLE ON AN END
[ct=725.247] AROUND AND JAYLEN WADDLE PICKS
[ct=725.796] UP FOUR.
[ct=728.906] YOU TALK ABOUT HILL AND YOU PICK
[ct=732.954] UP WADDLE, THAT IS AS GOOD AS IT
[ct=734.510] GETS AS A 1-2 PUNCH.
[ct=738.291] KIRK: YOU CAN LOOK AT A
[ct=739.771] DIFFERENT STYLE, JA'MARR CHASE
[ct=742.220] AND TEE HIGGINS BUT THESE TWO
[ct=742.220] SET THE PACE.
[ct=744.932] JAYLEN WADDLE IS THE TOP NUMBER
[ct=746.965] 2 RECEIVER IN THIS LEAGUE.
[ct=749.496] THEY ARE NOT MESSING AROUND WITH
[ct=749.818] BUFFALO.
[ct=751.536] RESPECT FOR THE SPEED.
[ct=754.437] MOST OF THIS NIGHT THEY WILL
[ct=756.821] MAKE THEM EARN IT AND HAVE TO
[ct=757.331] DRIVE THE LENGTH OF THE FIELD.
[ct=759.978] AL: A FLIP, HERE GOES TYREEK
[ct=764.966] HILL IS BOUNCED OUT OF BOUNDS AT
[ct=765.802] THE 42 YARD LINE.
[ct=768.431] A FIRST DOWN FOR THE DOLPHINS.
[ct=773.646] KIRK: AGAIN, IF YOU ARE GOING TO
[ct=775.516] KEEP THOSE SAFETIES BACK,
[ct=777.065] WILL HAVE TO RALLY TO THE BALL
[ct=779.739] AND GET AS MANY HATS THERE AS
[ct=781.066] YOU CAN.
[ct=783.725] HE GETS HIT AS HE IS ABOUT TO GO
[ct=785.258] OUT OF BOUNDS BY THE CORNER,
[ct=785.824] CHRISTIAN BENFORD.
[ct=790.599] THAT IS THE ANSWER -- RUN THE
[ct=793.095] FOOTBALL, SHORT PASS GAME AND
[ct=793.665] THEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN
[ct=794.011] IN THE RED ZONE.
[ct=801.230] AL: HE HAD AN 80-YARDER LAST
[ct=801.230] WEEK.
[ct=803.847] WE WILL HEAR FROM BILL VINOVICH
[ct=804.369] FOR THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT.
[ct=809.678] REFEREE: FALSE START, OFFENSE,
[ct=809.999] NUMBER 89.
[ct=812.555] FIVE YARD PENALTY, STILL FIRST
[ct=816.510] AL: AS HIGHLY A RESPECTED AS A
[ct=817.629] REFEREE AS THERE IS, BILL
[ct=817.938] VINOVICH.
[ct=823.377] KIRK: WHAT IS THE OVER/UNDER ON
[ct=824.344] HOW MANY GAMES YOU HAVE CALLED
[ct=824.690] OF HIS?
[ct=825.797] AL: A LOT.
[ct=827.656] HE IS GOOD, THOUGH.
[ct=829.703] CONSISTENTLY GOOD.
[ct=834.887] MCDERMITT IN HIS EIGHTH SEASON,
[ct=835.585] MCDANIEL IN HIS THIRD AS YOU
[ct=836.036] LOOK AT THE COACHES.
[ct=839.110] NOW, FIRST AND 15.
[ct=840.707] FLIP BACK.
[ct=844.531] ACHANE HAS ROOM, THERE HE GOES!
[ct=849.819] AUSTIN JACKSON LEADING THE WAY,
[ct=851.061] THE RIGHT TACKLE.
[ct=855.053] ACHANE AVERAGE LAST YEAR OVER 7
[ct=859.068] YARDS PER CARRY.
[ct=860.372] THIS TIME, GOOD FOR 14.
[ct=863.021] KIRK: THE MOTION AND THE
[ct=868.424] MISDIRECTION JUST THE
[ct=869.655] LINEBACKERS TO TAKE ONE STEP IN
[ct=870.977] THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND
[ct=870.977] CREATES SPACE.
[ct=874.964] AL: SECOND AND INCHES.
[ct=879.104] A LITTLE MORE THAN HALFWAY
[ct=880.468] THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER.
[ct=881.797] HILL IN MOTION.
[ct=883.094] THROUGH THE MIDDLE.
[ct=887.134] BIG HOLE,
[ct=891.059] ACHANE TO THE 25 YARD LINE.
[ct=893.728] RAHEEM MOSTERT IS HURTS.
[ct=897.731] THEY ARE 1 AND 1A
[ct=903.019] KIRK: BOBBY BABICH TAKING OVER
[ct=904.399] AS THE DEFENSIVE PLAY CALLER.
[ct=909.662] THIS YEAR, HE IS HANDED THOSE
[ct=909.662] DUTIES.
[ct=912.362] YOU CAN SEE THE PLAN TONIGHT.
[ct=916.333] TRY TO KEEP THE SPEED IN FRONT
[ct=917.602] OF THEM BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO
[ct=920.298] TACKLE WELL AGAIN SOME VERY
[ct=920.298] ELUSIVE RUNN
[ct=921.594] RECEIVERS.
[ct=925.589] AL: SPIN-O-RAMA AGAIN.
[ct=929.586] A LOT OF ACTION BUT ACHANE PICKS
[ct=930.926] UP JUST ONE YARD ON THAT.
[ct=932.301] SECOND AND LONG.
[ct=934.896] KIRK: THE SNAP AFFECTS THE
[ct=934.896] TIMING.
[ct=941.545] HECKUVA PLAY BY TUA TO CATCH THE
[ct=941.545] BALL AND STILL GET IT TO ACHANE
[ct=944.240] AND THEN GET IT TO THE LINE OF
[ct=944.240] SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=948.197] IT LOOKED LIKE HE MIGHT ABORT
[ct=949.519] AND GIVE UP ON HANDING IT OFF.
[ct=953.489] NICE JOB BY ACHANE, WAITING FOR
[ct=953.489] HIM JUST LONG ENOUGH.
[ct=956.180] AL: A COUPLE OF HIGH SNAPS
[ct=957.469] ALREADY FROM AARON BREWER.
[ct=960.155] THIS TIME, A GOOD SNAP.
[ct=961.523] GOOD THROW.
[ct=966.846] INSIDE THE 20 TO THE 18 YARD
[ct=968.170] LINE GOES JEFF WILSON.
[ct=972.085] HE WOULD BE THE NUMBER 2 BACK IN
[ct=974.818] THE ABSENCE OF MOSTERT, ACHANE
[ct=976.124] NUMBER 1.
[ct=977.433] THERE IS MOSTERT.
[ct=982.750] 21 TOTAL TOUCHDOWNS LAST YEAR,
[ct=984.171] TIED FOR MOST IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=988.058] KIRK: JEFF WILSON, MOSTERT,
[ct=990.693] ACHANE, THEY ARE ALL IN THAT
[ct=992.029] 4.35
[ct=994.692] THEM.
[ct=997.430] AL: VON MILLER IN THE GAME FOR
[ct=1001.297] HE HAD A SACK LAST WEEK,
[ct=1002.678] SNAPPING A 14-GAME DROUGHT.
[ct=1006.708] TUA STEPS UP, FINDS THE OPEN MAN
[ct=1011.923] , INSIDE THE FIVE, TO THE 1-YARD
[ct=1011.923] LINE, JAYLEN WADDLE.
[ct=1014.598] JUST OUTSIDE THE GOAL LINE
[ct=1015.911] FIRST AND GOAL FROM THE 1.
[ct=1019.880] KIRK: WE ARE USED TO SEEING JOSH
[ct=1019.880] ALLEN MAKE THIS KIND OF MOVE AND
[ct=1021.245] NOW WE SEE IT FROM TUA.
[ct=1027.849] STEPS UP AND FREEZEZS CAM LEWIS.
[ct=1027.849] HE IS CONCERNED ABOUT TUA
[ct=1029.287] OFF.
[ct=1033.313] TUA LOOKS DOWNFIELD, DOES NOT
[ct=1034.509] HESITATE TO GET THE BALL TO
[ct=1034.509] JAYLEN WADDLE.
[ct=1037.200] MOVING THE BALL IN FRONT OF
[ct=1038.512] THOSE SAFETIES, RIGHT DOWN THE
[ct=1038.512] FIELD.
[ct=1041.173] AL: FIRST DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=1046.539] ACHANE, CAN HE GET THERE?
[ct=1049.131] THE BALL IS OUT!
[ct=1050.471] HILL COMES UP WITH IT.
[ct=1053.134] THEY MIGHT HAVE RULED HIM DOWN.
[ct=1055.772] A FLAG IS THROWN.
[ct=1062.514] NUMBER 74.
[ct=1070.373] AL: THE PLAY BLOWN DEAD ANYWAY.
[ct=1074.448] IT LOOK LIKE LIAM EICHENBERG,
[ct=1075.709] THE RIGHT GUARD, WITH THE
[ct=1075.907] PENALTY.
[ct=1079.621] BACK NOW TO THE 6-YARD LINE.
[ct=1084.878] PRETTY CLEAR THERE.
[ct=1087.654] PLAY BLOWN DEAD.
[ct=1090.276] AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME.
[ct=1094.094] NOW ACHANE, SETTING UP NEXT TO
[ct=1094.456] TUA.
[ct=1097.702] GIVE IT TO ACHANE AGAIN.
[ct=1101.139] THREADS HIS WAY FOR A YARD,
[ct=1102.048] MAYBE TWO.
[ct=1105.996] UNDER FOUR MINUTES TO PLAY IN
[ct=1106.413] THE FIRST QUARTER.
[ct=1108.552] ED OLIVER MAKES THE TACKLE.
[ct=1112.116] KIRK: GO BACK TO THE STRATEGY OF
[ct=1112.487] BUFFALO TRYING TO MAKE THEM EARN
[ct=1112.680] IT.
[ct=1116.881] IT WILL BE THE 10TH PLAY OF THE
[ct=1117.487] DRIVE FOR MIKE MCDANIEL AND THE
[ct=1118.070] OFFENSE FOR THE DOLPHINS.
[ct=1121.006] YOU WILL GIVE UP YARDS IF YOU
[ct=1121.181] ARE BUFFALO.
[ct=1124.461] WHAT HAPPENS IN THE RED AREA?
[ct=1127.642] ARE THEY KICKING FIELD GOALS OR
[ct=1128.071] SCORING TOUCHDOWNS?
[ct=1132.955] AL: MIAMI LAST YEAR, SECOND-BEST
[ct=1134.715] SECOND AND GOAL.
[ct=1136.424] TUA UNDER PRESSURE.
[ct=1138.690] FLIPS IT TO THE OUTSIDE AND
[ct=1140.993] ACHANE IS THERE.
[ct=1142.961] THE DEFENDER FALLING DOWN AND
[ct=1145.137] ACHANE WALKS INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=1147.564] CAM LEWIS FALLING DOWN.
[ct=1150.813] EASY ROAD TO 6.
[ct=1158.908] KIRK: TWO DOLPHINS OUT IN THE
[ct=1158.908] FLAT.
[ct=1162.047] SPECTER GETS LOST IN COVERAGE.
[ct=1166.872] HE WILL LOOK AROUND TRYING TO
[ct=1167.439] FIGURE OUT IF HE HAS A CROSSER.
[ct=1170.602] HE NEEDS TO GET OUT IN THE FLAT
[ct=1172.419] AND DEAL WITH A BACK.
[ct=1181.895] AL: ACHANE NOW 13 TOUCHDOWNS IN
[ct=1181.895] 13 CAREER GAMS.
[ct=1184.552] SANDERS TIES THE GAME WITH THE
[ct=1185.871] EXTRA POINT.
[ct=1187.209] PERFECT BALANCE ON THAT DRIVE.
[ct=1191.187] 10 PLAYS -- FIVE RUNS, FIVE
[ct=1192.514] PASSES.
[ct=1195.280] 3:21 TO GO IN THE QUARTER, 7-7.
[ct=1196.600] DIERDORF.
[ct=1197.889] DAN MARINO, ONE OF THE ALL-TIME
[ct=1197.889] GREATS.
[ct=1200.580] HALL OF FAME CLASS OF 2005.
[ct=1204.540] THAT GAME ENDED AT THE 1-YARD
[ct=1207.216] DOUG FLUTIE TRY TO HIT ANDRE
[ct=1208.523] REED.
[ct=1209.822] IT WAS A CRAZY GAME.
[ct=1212.801] ANOTHER TOUCHBACK HERE.
[ct=1215.187] KIRK: WE ALL WENT BACK AND WERE
[ct=1216.515] LOOKING AT SOME OF THE MEMORIES
[ct=1216.515] FROM THAT GAME.
[ct=1219.161] IT WAS FUN TO WATCH YOU RELIVE
[ct=1223.119] AL: THERE WERE.
[ct=1225.793] IT WAS A WILD-CARD GAME FOR THE
[ct=1225.793] AGES.
[ct=1231.090] JIMMY JOHNSON WAS THE HEAD COACH
[ct=1233.727] AND YOU HAD THE BUFFALO BILLS
[ct=1236.446] CLOSING IN.
[ct=1239.090] THIS WAS THE 1990'S.
[ct=1241.700] IN THE 1990'S, THEY WERE GOOD --
[ct=1241.700] HERE THEY COME AGAIN WITH THE
[ct=1245.675] FOUR STRAIGHT SUPER BALLS, DID
[ct=1251.015] NOT -- SUPER BOWLS, DID NOT WIN
[ct=1251.015] ANY.
[ct=1256.377] KAYLEE: WE SAW THE BILLS ONLY
[ct=1260.318] OTHER CAPTAIN BESIDES JOSH
[ct=1261.649] ALLEN, THAT WOULD BE TERREL
[ct=1263.150] BERNARD, HEAD INTO THE LOCKER
[ct=1264.427] ROOM AFTER A QUICK VISIT IN THE
[ct=1264.427] BLUE TENT.
[ct=1266.972] HE WAS HOLDING ONTO HIS LEFT
[ct=1266.972] SHOULDER.
[ct=1272.278] KEEP AN EYE ON THAT.
[ct=1274.934] AL: THAT WOULD BE A VERY BIG
[ct=1274.934] LOSS.
[ct=1276.221] SECOND DOWN AND 7.
[ct=1280.214] ALLEN THROWS OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=1280.214] SHAKIR.
[ct=1282.897] THIRD AND.
[ct=1288.172] KIRK: A HUGE POTENTIAL LOSS WITH
[ct=1288.172] BERNARD.
[ct=1292.166] YOU HAVE TWO NEW SAFETIES.
[ct=1294.879] CAM LEWIS IS IN.
[ct=1300.178] IF YOU ARE A BILLS FAN, YOU
[ct=1301.507] ALREADY CONCERNED ABOUT THE
[ct=1301.507] INJURIES.
[ct=1304.128] SEEING THAT IS NOT GOOD.
[ct=1305.493] AL: WITHOUT QUESTION.
[ct=1309.461] THIRD DOWN AND 1 FOR BUFFALO.
[ct=1313.418] TY JOHNSON, THIRD DOWN BACK,
[ct=1314.809] NUMBER 26 INTO THE GAME.
[ct=1318.795] ALLEN DROPS IT, UNDER PRESSURE,
[ct=1321.424] ESCAPES, KEEPS IS EYES
[ct=1324.128] DOWNFIELD, FIRES, NOT AWAY.
[ct=1328.056] CALAIS CAMPBELL GOT HIS HANDS ON
[ct=1329.424] IT AT 6'8".
[ct=1332.030] FOURTH AND 1.
[ct=1333.408] KIRK: PEOPLE WILL WONDER ABOUT
[ct=1334.698] THE GLOVE.
[ct=1336.018] I THINK HE JUST DROPS IT.
[ct=1338.734] YOU SEE HIM TRY TO BRING THE
[ct=1338.734] BALL IN.
[ct=1342.257] WHAT A TOUGH TIME FOR THAT TO
[ct=1343.134] HAPPEN FOR JOSH ALLEN AND
[ct=1345.874] BUFFALO ON THIRD AND 1 WITH A
[ct=1347.087] SHOCK TO TRY TO GET THE FIRST
[ct=1347.957] DOWN AND KEEP THE DRIVE MOVING.
[ct=1351.126] AL: WENT FOR IT ON FOURTH DOWN
[ct=1351.627] THE LAST TIME.
[ct=1354.398] OF COURSE THEY WERE DEEP IN
[ct=1354.618] MIAMI TERRITORY.
[ct=1358.468] SAM MARTIN, NOW IN HIS 12TH
[ct=1362.058] BERRIOS BACK.
[ct=1366.201] MAKES THE FAI NOT ME, BABY, THEY
[ct=1373.249] SLEEP IS A FOREIGN CONCEPT TO
[ct=1374.665] SOME OF OUR FRIENDS.
[ct=1379.827] BALL AT THE 16-YARD LINE.
[ct=1381.188] COMING OUT IN THE PISTOL ABOUT
[ct=1381.414] HALF THE TIME.
[ct=1385.282] HANDS THE BALL OFF TO ACHANE,
[ct=1385.508] GAIN OF ONE.
[ct=1387.245] KIRK: IT IS FUN TO WATCH TUA
[ct=1392.292] -- RUN THIS OFFENSE OF MIKE
[ct=1392.662] MCDANIEL.
[ct=1397.105] THE BALL HANDLING, HOW
[ct=1397.105] COMFORTABLE HE IS.
[ct=1403.762] HE IS TRYING TO AFFECT THE
[ct=1406.396] DEFENSE AS MUCH AS HE CAN WITH
[ct=1407.551] DIFFERENT WAYS OF CARRYING OUT
[ct=1410.058] FAKES, USING HIS EYES, MOVEMENT
[ct=1410.514] WITH HIS SHOULDERS.
[ct=1419.111] AL: DOLPHINS RUNNING THEIR 18TH
[ct=1419.111] PLAY.
[ct=1420.403] HERE COMES HILL.
[ct=1421.682] TYREEK HILL.
[ct=1425.798] FIRST DOWN AND A COUPLE MORE
[ct=1427.077] BEFORE HE IS FORCED OUT OF
[ct=1428.341] BOUNDS BY DAMAR HAMLIN.
[ct=1429.691] IT IS SO GREAT TO SEE HAMLIN
[ct=1431.032] BACK.
[ct=1433.697] YOU ALL KNOW THE STORY ABOUT THE
[ct=1436.316] CARDIAC ARREST IN CINCINNATI AT
[ct=1437.639] THE END OF THE SEASON, FIGHTING
[ct=1439.012] FOR HIS LIFE.
[ct=1440.318] HERE HE IS.
[ct=1441.611] HE STARTED LAST WEEK.
[ct=1443.006] IT IS GREAT.
[ct=1444.292] KIRK: IT REALLY IS.
[ct=1448.288] YOU TALK TO BUFFALO, THE COACHES
[ct=1449.608] AND THE PLAYERS, THEY LOOK AT
[ct=1452.284] DAMAR HAMLIN LIKE HE IS PLAYING
[ct=1454.948] SAFETY AND IN A BIG ROLE BECAUSE
[ct=1456.259] OF THE LOSSES OF MICAH HYDE AND
[ct=1456.259] JORDAN POYER.
[ct=1458.649] HE HAS BIG SHOES TO FILL.
[ct=1460.175] AL: TUA BACK.
[ct=1464.759] TUA HAS TIME, OVERTHROWS,
[ct=1468.526] INTERCEPTED AT THE 50, THAT IS
[ct=1474.313] BENFORD WITH THE PICK.
[ct=1477.776] TUA NOW WITH TWO PICKS
[ct=1478.692] OPENING FRAME.
[ct=1482.248] KIRK: THE BIGGEST CONCERN WITH
[ct=1483.843] ODELL BECKHAM DOWN IS FINDING
[ct=1484.125] THE THIRD RECEIVER.
[ct=1489.755] MORE OF A VERTICAL THREAT, NOT
[ct=1490.430] ON THE SAME PAGE.
[ct=1493.819] TUA LIKES TO ANTICIPATE, GET THE
[ct=1494.172] BALL OUT EARLY.
[ct=1498.658] HE AND 84 ARE NOT ON THE SAME
[ct=1500.242] PAGE AND AN EASY INTERCEPTION
[ct=1500.242] FOR BENFORD.
[ct=1506.020] AL: HAD A PICK LAST YEAR IN THE
[ct=1506.020] LAST GAME OF THE SEASON.
[ct=1508.963] BUFFALO WON THAT GAME.
[ct=1510.760] THERE IS CHOSEN.
[ct=1514.427] HE USED TO GO BY THE NAME ROBBIE
[ct=1515.278] ANDERSON WHEN HE WAS WITH THE
[ct=1515.661] JETS.
[ct=1518.103] 41 SECONDS LEFT IN THE QUARTER.
[ct=1519.749] THIS TIME IT IS SHAKIR.
[ct=1524.805] BOTH TEAMS USING THEIR NUMBER 10
[ct=1528.587] ON PLAYS, RUNNING PLAYS, HILL ON
[ct=1530.544] ONE SIDE, SHAKIR ON THE OTHER.
[ct=1533.793] HOLLAND MAKES THE TACKLE.
[ct=1537.002] SECOND DOWN KIRK: THAT IS ONE
[ct=1538.342] THING TO DO AGAINST A TEAM TO
[ct=1538.342] HAVE DOMINATED.
[ct=1541.287] YOU GET TURNOVERS EARLY IN PLUS
[ct=1541.591] TERRITORY.
[ct=1549.222] AL: BUFFALO WILL LET THE CLOCK
[ct=1550.694] RUN OUT AND WE WILL CHANGE SIDES
[ct=1552.712] OF THESTART THE SECOND QUARTER.
[ct=1556.465] AL MICHAELS, KIRK HERBSTREIT,
[ct=1556.768] KAYLEE HARTUNG.
[ct=1560.250] TUA THE FIRST TIME IN 55 CAREER
[ct=1563.427] GAMES WITH TWO PICKS IN
[ct=1565.060] FIRST QUARTER.
[ct=1568.062] THE GAME IS TIED, 7-7, SECOND
[ct=1568.384] DOWN AND 8.
[ct=1573.168] THE BILLS AT THE 42-YARD LINE.
[ct=1581.198] ALLEN.
[ct=1583.904] FAKES A THROW.
[ct=1588.158] PEOPLE TAKE OFF AND SLIDES TO A
[ct=1589.665] STOP AT THE 39-YARD LINE.
[ct=1592.424] JALEN RAMSEY FORCED THE ISSUE.
[ct=1596.678] WHEN HE SEES HIS GUYS COVERED,
[ct=1596.678] OFF HE GOES AND WE SEE THAT
[ct=1598.033] GREAT FREQUENCY.
[ct=1602.694] KIRK: DAVID LONG SAYING IF YOU
[ct=1604.033] DO THAT ONE TOO MANY TIMES, WE
[ct=1604.877] WILL KNOCK YOU OUT, KIND OF
[ct=1605.163] THING.
[ct=1607.775] THAT PUMP FAKE IS LEGENDARY.
[ct=1610.935] ANTHONY WEAVER TELLING HIS GUYS
[ct=1611.654] TO PLAY THROUGH HIS RIGHT HAND.
[ct=1613.772] DO NOT GET AIRBORNE ON THOSE
[ct=1614.431] PUMP FAKES.
[ct=1616.247] EASIER SAID THAN DONE.
[ct=1618.520] AL: THIRD DOWN AND 5.
[ct=1624.664] ALLEN FIRES AND IT IS SHAKIR
[ct=1631.202] MAKING THE GRAB TO MOVE.
[ct=1631.617] THE STICKS TACKLED BY DAVID
[ct=1631.617] LONG.
[ct=1635.068] SHAKIR IS THE ONLY WIDE RECEIVER
[ct=1635.381] ON THE ROSTER WHO HAD EVER
[ct=1637.817] CAUGHT A PASS FROM ALLEN COMING
[ct=1638.128] INTO THIS SEASON.
[ct=1642.662] KIRK: BESIDES THE TIGHT ENDS,
[ct=1642.662] JUST TO SKILL SET.
[ct=1644.008] LOOK AT THAT.
[ct=1645.995] NICE JOB SETTLING IN THE ZONE.
[ct=1649.128] HOW ABOUT THE PROTECTION BY THE
[ct=1651.028] OFFENSIVE LINE TO MAKE SURE HE
[ct=1651.431] HAD A CHANCE.
[ct=1654.582] YOU SEE HIM WORK THROUGH THE
[ct=1655.186] PROGRESSIONS TO MAKE THE THROW.
[ct=1660.125] AL: IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=1665.252] COOK ESCAPES THE FIRST MAN AND
[ct=1666.152] TURNS WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A
[ct=1668.161] LOSS INTO A NICE LITTLE GAIN.
[ct=1672.146] GOT AWAY FROM JALEN RAMSEY, WHO
[ct=1675.813] OF COURSE COVERS, CAN BLITZ AND
[ct=1676.407] CAN USUALLY STOP YOU IN THE
[ct=1677.000] BACKFIELD BUT NOT THAT TIME.
[ct=1680.248] KIRK: JALEN RAMSEY SEES MACK
[ct=1682.385] HOLLINS GOING IN MOTION AND HE
[ct=1682.457] WILL SHOOT UNDERNEATH.
[ct=1688.113] ANOTHER FLORIDA STATE ALUM, KEON
[ct=1689.533] COLEMAN, HE GETS UNDERNEATH AND
[ct=1689.861] AFFECTS THE PLAY.
[ct=1691.821] A PRETTY GOOD EFFORT BY JAMES
[ct=1693.582] COOK JUST TO KEEP THE PLAY
[ct=1693.915] ALIVE.
[ct=1695.745] AL: SECOND AND 7.
[ct=1701.632] CURTIS SAMUEL’
[ct=1703.627] CURTIS SAMUEL'S HEADING OUTSIDE
[ct=1704.659] AT THE 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=1708.843] ALLEN LOOKING LEFT, ALLEN
[ct=1713.548] THROWING LEFT TO SAMUEL AND
[ct=1713.548] BROKEN UP IN THE END ZONE.
[ct=1716.573] CURTIS SAMUEL, ONE OF THE NEW
[ct=1720.173] RECEIVERS, JORDYN BROOKS ABLE TO
[ct=1720.443] KNOCK IT AWAY.
[ct=1725.306] SAMUEL COMING OVER AS A FREE
[ct=1725.637] AGENT FROM THE COMMANDERS.
[ct=1729.040] KIRK: BROOKS IS A GUY WHO HAS
[ct=1730.316] THIS SKILL SET BECAUSE OF THE
[ct=1730.316] SPEED HE HAS.
[ct=1732.062] HE CAN RUN.
[ct=1734.647] THAT IS CURTIS SAMUEL, WHO CAN
[ct=1735.040] GO.
[ct=1737.787] NEVER GETS HIS HEAD AROUND TO
[ct=1739.367] LOOK AT THE FOOTBALL BUT HAS
[ct=1741.658] GOOD POSITION AND GETS THE LEFT
[ct=1742.312] ARM UP AT THE LAST SECOND.
[ct=1743.832] AL: THIRD AND 7.
[ct=1753.655] FOUR-MAN RUSH.
[ct=1754.849] ALLEN WITH TIME.
[ct=1756.376] INCOMPLETE.
[ct=1758.208] THROWS IT LOW.
[ct=1761.848] TRYING TO GET IT TO TY JOHNSON
[ct=1761.963] THE THIRD DOWN BACK.
[ct=1765.107] FOURTH DOWN, IN COMES THE FIELD
[ct=1769.580] GOAL UNIT TO ATTEMPT ABOUT A 45-
[ct=1772.441] YARD, 46-YARD FIELD GOAL.
[ct=1774.918] KIRK: ANTHONY WEAVER CHANGING UP
[ct=1774.918] THE LOOKS.
[ct=1777.005] SETTLED BACK IN ZONE.
[ct=1778.722] MOVED AFTER THE SNAP.
[ct=1781.816] HE GOT UNCOMFORTABLE AND ALL HE
[ct=1782.188] COULD DO WAS THROW IT AWAY.
[ct=1784.674] AL: SAM MARTIN TO HOLD IT.
[ct=1788.670] TYLER BASS TO KICK IT.
[ct=1795.336] AND FROM 43, IT IS RIGHT DOWN
[ct=1795.336] THE MIDDLE.
[ct=1801.920] 12:41 REMAINING IN THE FIRST
[ct=1801.920] HALF.
[ct=1806.190] HARD ROCK STADIUM, MIAMI
[ct=1806.690] GARDENS, FLORIDA.
[ct=1814.001] BUFFALO ON TOP, 10-7.10-7, BUFFA
[ct=1814.001] FIELD GOAL.
[ct=1819.907] WE HAVE HAD THREE KICKOFFS, ALL
[ct=1819.907] RESULTING IN TOUCHBACKS.
[ct=1823.103] SO MUCH FOR THE DYNAMIC KICKOFF.
[ct=1826.971] KIRK: TIME FOR THE TI FACTOR --
[ct=1830.662] IT FACTOR, FUELED BY GATORADE.
[ct=1833.379] THE BUFFALO DEFENSE, DOWN
[ct=1833.905] SOMEBODY'S.
[ct=1836.586] ONE GUY WHO HAS STEPPED UP HIS
[ct=1840.514] GREAT JOB IN COVERAGE.
[ct=1841.844] LOOK AT THE EYES IN ZONE.
[ct=1844.127] GOOD JOB OF READING TUA.
[ct=1845.889] THE BALL IS OVERTHROWN.
[ct=1848.490] BENFORD DOES A GREAT JOB OF
[ct=1848.680] BEING THERE.
[ct=1851.258] HE IS OFF TO A GREAT
[ct=1855.513] NOT A LOT OF MAN-TO-MAN BUT
[ct=1856.832] PLAYING GREAT IN ZONE.
[ct=1856.832] GREAT AWARENESS.
[ct=1861.056] AL: JAYLEN WRIGHT, A ROOKIE OUT
[ct=1863.023] OF TENNESSEE, FOURTH ROUND PICK,
[ct=1863.304] IS IN THE GAME.
[ct=1865.038] BEHIND TUA.
[ct=1866.386] THERE HE GOES.
[ct=1869.225] PICKS UP ABOUT FOUR.
[ct=1873.414] THAT BUFFALO DEFENSE, DO NOT
[ct=1876.598] FORGET BERNARD, OUT, AT LEAST
[ct=1876.883] FOR THE MOMENT.
[ct=1880.141] 54, BAYLON SPECTOR COMES IN.
[ct=1884.308] KIRK: SPECTOR, OUT OF CLEMSON,
[ct=1884.902] HAD A GREAT CAREER.
[ct=1888.879] TWO NEW SAFETIES, DAMAR HAMLIN
[ct=1889.429] AND TAYLOR RAPP.
[ct=1892.895] TARON JOHNSON IS OUT SO CAM
[ct=1893.348] LEWIS IS IN.
[ct=1898.488] HAVE A BACKUP LINEBACKER A LOT
[ct=1901.655] OF BACKUPS PLAYING IN BUFFALO.
[ct=1903.798] AL: MATT MILANO ON INJURED
[ct=1904.422] RESERVE.
[ct=1906.613] THROUGH THE MIDDLE, THERE GOES
[ct=1906.946] THE ROOKIE.
[ct=1910.386] WE HAVE A FLAG DOWN IN THE
[ct=1911.977] OFFENSIVE BACKFIELD.
[ct=1912.543] THAT WILL NEGATE THAT RUN.
[ct=1915.970] KIRK: I THINK IT WAS A CENTER,
[ct=1916.357] BREWER, ON A HOLD.
[ct=1921.740] REFEREE: HOLDING, OFFENSE,
[ct=1922.306] NUMBER 72.
[ct=1924.687] 10 YARD PENALTY, SECOND DOWN.
[ct=1927.616] KIRK: ARMSTEAD, THE LEFT TACKLE.
[ct=1930.870] THE CENTER DEFINITELY GOT
[ct=1931.601] INVOLVED IN A HOLD HIMSELF.
[ct=1937.402] MCDANIEL FRUSTRATED.
[ct=1938.078] IT LOOKS LIKE TO HAVE SOME
[ct=1938.878] POSITIVE STEP FORWARD AND END UP
[ct=1938.878] GOING BACK.
[ct=1941.994] 72, IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR
[ct=1942.874] SCREEN, SEE HIM GET UNDERNEATH
[ct=1946.346] THE PADS OF ALL OF HER, WHICH IS
[ct=1946.656] TOUGH TO DO.
[ct=1952.506] ED OLIVER IS ONLY 6'1", NOT A
[ct=1955.104] BIG INTERIOR D-LINEMAN.
[ct=1959.019] AL: ARMSTEAD, 12TH YEAR IN THE
[ct=1959.246] LEAGUE.

[ct=1973.426] SETTING UP A THIRD DOWN AND
[ct=1975.905] MANAGEABLE AFTER A SECOND DOWN
[ct=1975.905] AND 17.
[ct=1978.148] KIRK: WE JUST TALKED ABOUT TUA
[ct=1980.695] DOING A GOOD JOB WITH HIS
[ct=1980.824] BALLHANDLING.
[ct=1984.167] HE GIVES A LITTLE LOOK AND THEN

[ct=1991.358] UNDERNEATH TO JONNU SMITH AND HE
[ct=1991.358] IS ABLE TO PICK UP SOME BIG
[ct=1991.588] YARDS.
[ct=1994.287] THEY HAVE A REAL SHOT NOW TO
[ct=1994.287] CONVERT.
[ct=1997.607] SMITH COMING OVER GIVES THEM A
[ct=2000.070] THREAT OF THE TIGHT END POSITION
[ct=2001.316] WHICH THEY HAVE NOT HAD IN THE
[ct=2001.316] LAST FEW YEARS.

[ct=2053.962] THEY HAVE RELEASED BODY CAM
[ct=2056.442] FOOTAGE OF HILL BEING FORCED OUT
[ct=2056.681] OF HIS CAR.
[ct=2060.914] HILL ACKNOWLEDGES HE COULD HAVE
[ct=2062.305] BEEN BETTER IN THE MOMENT BUT IS
[ct=2063.351] PUBLICLY CALLING FOR AN OFFICER
[ct=2063.658] TO BE FIRED.
[ct=2067.029] HE SAID HE WANTS THE INCIDENT TO
[ct=2067.358] BE A LEARNING TOOL FOR EVERYONE.
[ct=2070.540] AL: THAT WAS AN AMAZING
[ct=2070.758] SITUATION ON SUNDAY.
[ct=2075.901] PULLED OUT OF THE CAR, IS ABLE
[ct=2078.590] TO PLAY -- I DON'T KNOW IF

[ct=2084.150] HE HAD AN 80-YARD TOUCHDOWN
[ct=2084.517] RECEPTION.
[ct=2087.178] KIRK: I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
[ct=2087.451] LIKE THAT.
[ct=2089.910] AL: THE VIDEO IS UNBELIEVABLE.
[ct=2091.622] RAY DAVIS IS THE RUNNING BACK.
[ct=2094.638] THROW TO HIM.
[ct=2098.683] CHASED DOWN AT THE LINE OF
[ct=2102.947] CHOP ROBINSON MAKING THE TACKLE.
[ct=2104.543] SECOND AND 11.
[ct=2107.172] KIRK: RAY DAVIS IS A LEGITIMATE
[ct=2109.650] BACK AS A ROOKIE OUT OF
[ct=2109.944] KENTUCKY.
[ct=2112.704] HE ACTUALLY WENT TO THREE
[ct=2116.743] SCHOOLS -- TEMPLE, VANDY, AND
[ct=2118.712] KENTUCKY, HE HAD 1000 YARDS AT
[ct=2119.065] ALL THREE STOPS.
[ct=2125.156] JAMES COOK AND TY JOHNSON ALSO,
[ct=2125.156] VERY PHYSICAL.
[ct=2133.391] AL: SAMUEL SETS UP AT THE BOTTOM
[ct=2133.694] OF THE SCREEN.
[ct=2136.457] NOW YOU HAVE THE PASS OVER THE
[ct=2138.357] MIDDLE AND IT IS CAUGHT IN
[ct=2138.763] TRAFFIC.
[ct=2142.449] HERE COMES A FLAG AT THE END OF
[ct=2142.840] THE PLAY.
[ct=2152.479] IT WAS SECOND AND 11.
[ct=2158.863] MCDANIEL OBVIOUSLY INDICATING
[ct=2159.828] WHICH WAY HE WANTS IT TO GO.
[ct=2165.414] REFEREE: PERSONAL FOUL,

[ct=2177.399] AL: THAT IS FORMER BILL AND
[ct=2177.584] CURRENT DOLPHIN, JORDAN POYER.
[ct=2179.142] HELMET TO HELMET.
[ct=2182.023] IN THE FLAG AND 15.
[ct=2184.705] KIRK: NOT JUST A PERSONAL FOUL.
[ct=2186.613] DO YOU SEE ANYTHING MORE?
[ct=2190.453] TERRY: I DON'T.
[ct=2193.447] IT LOOKS LIKE FORCIBLE HELMET TO
[ct=2195.202] HELMET CONTACT BUT I DO NOT
[ct=2197.585] THINK THEY WILL EXTEND THIS TO
[ct=2197.830] DISQUALIFICATION.
[ct=2201.295] KIRK: GREAT JOB OF HOLDING ONTO
[ct=2201.295] THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=2203.814] SHAKIR IS THE REAL DEAL IN THE
[ct=2204.463] SLOT FOR THESE GUYS.
[ct=2206.701] AL: SAMUEL GOES IN MOTION.
[ct=2208.933] HERE GOES DAVIS.

[ct=2220.614] DAWKINS, WHO IS NO STRANGER OF
[ct=2222.610] GOING TO THE PRO BOWL,
[ct=2225.189] 73.
[ct=2228.004] KIRK: JOB READY DOING A GREAT
[ct=2229.932] JOB OF MIXING UP THE LOOKS, NOT
[ct=2230.872] PUTTING IT ALL ON THE SHOULDERS
[ct=2231.107] OF JOSH ALLEN.
[ct=2234.790] AL: SECOND AND 2.
[ct=2237.304] A DEFENSIVE ALERT.
[ct=2239.097] THAT PLAYER DOES COME.
[ct=2242.454] RAY DAVIS, DOING IT ON THE
[ct=2242.822] GROUND.
[ct=2246.121] TAKES IT TO THE 31 AND A FIRST
[ct=2246.660] DOWN FOR THE BILLS.
[ct=2249.449] KIRK: WATCHING RAY DAVIS IN
[ct=2254.095] COLLEGE, I THINK JOE BRADY IS
[ct=2254.396] VERY EXCITED WITH WHAT HE CAN
[ct=2254.396] BRING.
[ct=2257.109] JAMES COOK IS ALREADY ONE OF THE
[ct=2258.932] MORE UNDERRATED BACKS IN THE
[ct=2261.542] COUNTRY.
[ct=2263.479] HE WAS IN COLLEGE AT GEORGIA AND
[ct=2263.784] HE IS IN THE NFL.
[ct=2269.683] WHEN YOU COULD HAVE TWO OR THREE
[ct=2270.348] GUYS FIRING, ESPECIALLY ON A
[ct=2270.737] NIGHT LIKE THIS WITH THE
[ct=2273.198] HUMIDITY AS HIGH AS IT IS, IT IS
[ct=2273.198] GREAT.
[ct=2277.227] AL: TEMPERATURE IN THE MID-80'S,
[ct=2278.011] HUMIDITY ALSO IN THE MID-80'S.
[ct=2281.667] NOTHING DOING, TAKEN DOWN BY
[ct=2284.016] DAVID LONG, MAKING IT SECOND AND
[ct=2286.703] KIRK: I WAS JUST ABOUT TO
[ct=2289.522] LOT OF TIMES WE GET CAUGHT UP IN
[ct=2293.552] ALL THE QUARTERBACKS AND THE
[ct=2294.823] SKILL, THIS OFFENSE OF LINE ON
[ct=2296.171] THE ROAD DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB
[ct=2298.887] OF PASS PROTECTION, MOVING
[ct=2298.887] PEOPLE AROUND AN OPENING SOME
[ct=2300.159] HOLES.
[ct=2302.831] A NICE JOB BY THE DOLPHINS ON
[ct=2302.831] THAT PLAY BUT FOR
[ct=2304.195] HOLDING THEIR OWN.
[ct=2308.252] AL: THE BILLS ARE ONE OF THE FEW
[ct=2309.450] TEAMS IN THE LEAGUE THAT HAD ALL
[ct=2313.431] FIVE OFFENSIVE LINEMEN START ALL
[ct=2314.708] GAMES LAST YEAR BUT THEY HAD TO
[ct=2316.063] MAKE SOME CHANGES THIS YEAR.
[ct=2321.398] THREE FLAGS.
[ct=2327.174] NUMBER 79.
[ct=2329.882] FIVE YARD PENALTY, STILL SECOND
[ct=2331.945] AL: THAT IS ON SPENCER BROWN.
[ct=2337.278] THAT IS BUFFALO'S FIRST PENALTY.
[ct=2337.551] MIAMI HAS BEEN FLAGGED
[ct=2339.181] TIMES.
[ct=2341.839] KIRK: MIAMI WALKED A LOT OF
[ct=2342.184] PEOPLE UP THERE.
[ct=2346.049] NOT CROSSING INTO THE NEUTRAL
[ct=2346.750] ZONE BUT SHOWING ANTICIPATION
[ct=2347.346] THEY ARE ABOUT TO COME.
[ct=2351.648] SPENCER BROWN ENDS UP LOSING IT
[ct=2351.890] AND IT COST THEM FIVE YARDS.
[ct=2354.926] AL: SECOND DOWN AND 16.
[ct=2360.539] ALLEN FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=2362.329] SHORT PICKUP.
[ct=2364.497] DAVID LONG IS RIGHT THERE.
[ct=2366.856] SHAKIR, THE RECEIVER.

[ct=2399.550] LOW SNAP.
[ct=2401.308] DANCING.

[ct=2406.532] FIRING DOWNFIELD, CAUGHT AT THE
[ct=2409.345] 2-YARD LINE, THEY WILL MARKET AT
[ct=2411.085] THE 1-YARD LINE.
[ct=2412.905] ALLEN EXTENDS THE PLAY.
[ct=2415.509] TY JOHNSON IS THE THIRD DOWN
[ct=2418.356] BACK, SEND HIM OUT ON A PATTERN
[ct=2418.768] AND FIND HIM OUT THE
[ct=2424.518] KIRK: ANY TIME 17 TAKES OFF, IT
[ct=2425.460] SEEMS LIKE HE IS ALWAYS GOING TO
[ct=2425.834] HIS RIGHT.
[ct=2428.766] TY JOHNSON NOT GIVING UP AND
[ct=2431.035] DOING HIS JOB, GOING DOWN THE
[ct=2433.632] RIGHT SIDE LINE JUST TO GIVE HIM
[ct=2434.321] THAT OPTION JUST IN CASE.
[ct=2436.317] MIAMI LOSES TY JOHNSON.
[ct=2438.586] JALEN RAMSEY IN COVERAGE.
[ct=2440.512] AL: FIRST AND GOAL FROM THE
[ct=2441.975] 1-YARD LINE.
[ct=2443.926] INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=2448.359] WALKING INTO THE END ZONE, JAMES
[ct=2449.120] COOK, FOR THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=2455.842] SO THE BUFFALO BILLS, WHO HAVE
[ct=2460.022] OWNED THE DOLPHINS, 11 WINS IN
[ct=2461.906] THEIR LAST 12 MEETINGS, NOT
[ct=2465.310] READY -- NOW READY TO TAKE WHAT
[ct=2467.060] WOULD BE A 10-POINT LEAD WITH
[ct=2467.445] THE EXTRA POINT.
[ct=2471.797] EIGHT PLAYS, 85 YARDS IN 4:30.
[ct=2474.557] KIRK: JOSH ALLEN BEING JOSH
[ct=2478.431] SCRAMBLING ON THAT BIG THIRD
[ct=2478.912] DOWN TO MAKE THE THROATED TY
[ct=2479.196] JOHNSON.
[ct=2482.602] WHAT A DRIVE.
[ct=2486.529] AL: BASS FOR THE EXTRA POINT.
[ct=2494.086] AND THE BUFFALO BILLS, ON THE
[ct=2498.791] ROAD, HAVE A 10-POINT LEAD WITH
[ct=2499.799] 6:25.
[ct=2500.403] THAT WAS NOT THE CASE LAST YEAR
[ct=2501.094] WHAT WE HAVE THE JETS TWICE,
[ct=2501.420] NEVER SAW AARON.
[ct=2503.839] THE JETS AT HOME AGAINST THE
[ct=2506.022] PATRIOTS ON THURSDAY NIGHT
[ct=2506.320] FOOTBALL NEXT WEEK.
[ct=2508.405] 17-7.

[ct=2514.655] AL: WE WILL HAVE THE GIANTS AND
[ct=2515.127] THE COWBOYS THE FOLLOWING WEEK.
[ct=2517.808] BASS NOW TO KICK OFF.
[ct=2522.180] SO MUCH FOR THE DYNAMIC KICKOFF,
[ct=2524.052] WHICH HAS TOTALLY FIZZLED
[ct=2524.868] TONIGHT.
[ct=2527.748] FIVE KICKOFF, FIVE TOUCHBACKS.
[ct=2530.705] KIRK: FOR THOSE JUST TUNING IN,
[ct=2533.983] TUA HAS BEEN OFF TO A ROUGH
[ct=2534.584] START, NOT ABLE TO GET THE
[ct=2538.294] RHYTHM GOING THAT YOU TYPICALLY
[ct=2539.230] SEE WITH THEM, MIKE MCDANIEL AND
[ct=2539.596] THE RECEIVERS.
[ct=2541.946] BUFFALO IS DOING A GOOD JOB OF
[ct=2545.528] PLAYING ZONE, FORCING HIM TO GO
[ct=2545.528] TO OTHER OPTIONS BESIDES TYREEK
[ct=2547.553] HILL AND JAYLEN WADDLE.
[ct=2549.521] THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ON THE SAME
[ct=2549.794] PAGE.
[ct=2553.068] THEY GOT A TOUCHDOWN ON A
[ct=2554.016] 10-PLAY DRIVE THEY HAD TO EARN.
[ct=2555.801] TWO INTERCEPTIONS.
[ct=2558.615] MIKE MCDANIEL TALKED ABOUT HIS
[ct=2559.010] MENTAL TOUGHNESS.
[ct=2560.206] IT IS BEING TESTED.
[ct=2562.833] AL: STARTING FROM THE 30 YARD
[ct=2566.733] STARTING ON THE GROUND.
[ct=2566.733] A GREAT GAIN BY ACHANE.
[ct=2571.969] FIX UP 17 OUT TO THE 47-YARD
[ct=2572.531] LINE, STOPPED BY HAMLIN.
[ct=2576.736] KIRK: GREAT BLOCK BY THE RIGHT
[ct=2577.584] TACKLE, AUSTIN JACKSON.
[ct=2583.193] ALSO, THE LEFT GUARD, ROBERT,
[ct=2583.193] COMING AROUND.
[ct=2586.774] THAT HOLE OPENED UP IN A HURRY.
[ct=2588.257] IT IS GOOD TO SEE ACHANE GET THE
[ct=2591.541] CHANCE TO HIT THE WHOLE GOING
[ct=2591.911] DOWNHILL IN A HURRY.
[ct=2597.681] AL: UNDER SIX TO PLAY IN THE
[ct=2597.681] FIRST HALF.
[ct=2600.037] FIRST DOWN AT THE 47-YARD LINE.
[ct=2603.138] THROUGH THE MIDDLE AGAIN.
[ct=2607.822] NICE TOUGH RUN ACROSS THE 50 TO
[ct=2610.099] THE 48-YARD LINE OF THE BILLS.
[ct=2611.458] SECOND DOWN.
[ct=2615.610] KIRK: SPECTOR INVOLVED IN THE
[ct=2616.738] TACKLE, HE AND WILLIAMS HOLDING
[ct=2618.200] IT DOWN WITH BERNARD OUT OF THE
[ct=2618.652] FOOTBALL GAME.
[ct=2622.923] SO FAR MIKE MCDANIEL AND MIAMI
[ct=2623.465] NOT ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE.
[ct=2626.947] TRYING TO EFFECTIVE
[ct=2627.532] COMMUNICATION WITH A LOT OF
[ct=2630.116] PRE-SNAP MOVEMENT, MAKE THE
[ct=2632.957] DEFENSE JUST ON THE FLIGHT,
[ct=2633.667] ESPECIALLY ON A SHORT WAIT BUT
[ct=2635.571] BUFFALO IS HOLDING UP SO FAR.
[ct=2637.414] AL: SECOND AND 5.
[ct=2640.505] AGAIN.
[ct=2645.362] NICE LITTLE MOVE THERE, A LITTLE
[ct=2645.362] SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2649.842] MCDANIEL EACH OF THE LAST TWO
[ct=2653.708] YEARS -- I HAVE DONE THE NFL FOR
[ct=2655.300] 39 YEARS, HE IS A BIRD OF A VERY
[ct=2655.913] DIFFERENT FEATHER.
[ct=2659.640] YOU ASKED IF I COULD RELATE
[ct=2662.594] ANYONE TO HIM, NO, AND I THINK I
[ct=2662.594] HAVE KNOWN EVERY COACH IN THE
[ct=2665.025] LEAGUE FOR FOUR DECADES.
[ct=2667.408] KIRK: YOU SEE IN HIS INTERVIEWS.
[ct=2669.409] WE HAD HIM WITH OUR TEAM.
[ct=2671.520] HE DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE.
[ct=2672.704] AL: NO.
[ct=2676.146] KIRK: HE WAS ENJOYING HANGING
[ct=2676.518] OUT AND TALKING FOOTBALL.
[ct=2678.321] AL: 1000%.
[ct=2679.433] THIRD AND 1.
[ct=2681.719] TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING.
[ct=2686.365] THIS TIME HE GETS STUFF, INGOLD
[ct=2689.254] WITH A SECONDARY.
[ct=2689.468] THAT IS DORIAN WILLIAMS.
[ct=2690.901] FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=2695.374] FOURTH DOWN AT THE 45-YARD LINE,
[ct=2697.427] THAT IS A LOSS OF ONE.
[ct=2698.734] FOURTH AND A DEUCE.
[ct=2702.838] RK: BERNARD IS NOT IN THERE,
[ct=2702.838] WHO IS GOING TO STEP UP?
[ct=2707.214] DORIAN WILLIAMS, ALMOST BUILT
[ct=2707.496] LIKE A SAFETY BUT PLAYS
[ct=2708.225] LINEBACKER.
[ct=2710.709] HE IS LEADING THE WAY IN THE
[ct=2710.952] MIDDLE.
[ct=2712.759] AL: FOURTH AND 2.
[ct=2714.954] THEY LINE UP TO GO FOR IT.
[ct=2717.017] EMPTY THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=2720.361] TAGOVAILOA UNDER PRESSURE AND HE
[ct=2723.809] WILL BE SACKED AT THE 48-YARD
[ct=2728.057] ED OLIVER BURSTING THROUGH.
[ct=2731.633] NOT ONLY DO THEY TURN IT OVER,
[ct=2732.877] THEY TURN IT OVER IN THEIR OWN
[ct=2736.408] 3:45 UNTIL HALFTIME, THE BILLS
[ct=2739.182] UP BY 10 AND WITH THE BALL.
[ct=2746.141] ACKFIELD
[ct=2747.301] AND COMES UP WITH THE SACK.
[ct=2750.870] HE PLAYED WITH SOME FIRE AND
[ct=2752.770] EMOTION ON THAT FORTH AND 2 TO
[ct=2754.731] GET THE BILLS THE BALL BACK.
[ct=2757.087] AL: MIAMI HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE.
[ct=2761.369] FOUR DAYS AGO THEY WERE DOWN 14
[ct=2763.499] AND THAT IS WHEN TUA MADE THE
[ct=2764.120] SPEECH IN THE LOCKER ROOM.
[ct=2767.900] THEY HIT THE DAILY -- SCORED AT
[ct=2769.792] THE END OF THE FIRST HALF AND
[ct=2771.393] THEN GOT THE BALL TO START THE
[ct=2772.825] SECOND HALF AND SCORED AGAIN.
[ct=2777.309] BUFFALO AT THE 49-YARD LINE.
[ct=2779.259] ON THE GROUND.
[ct=2782.055] BREAKING TACKLES, JAMES COOK!
[ct=2788.016] INSIDE THE 20, INSIDE THE 5,
[ct=2788.594] SOMERSAULTS FOR THE TOUCHDOWN!

[ct=2808.563] SO, ALL GETS THE BIG SACK, TURN
[ct=2812.517] IT OVER, ONE PLAY AND A
[ct=2812.796] TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=2821.120] KIRK: THIS GUY, COOK, IS A
[ct=2821.546] FOOTBALL PLAYER.
[ct=2824.879] WHAT A WAY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
[ct=2825.744] THE TURNOVER ON DOWNS.
[ct=2829.066] THIS PLAY -- WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE
[ct=2831.664] THIS, AL -- TALK ABOUT ZONE
[ct=2831.664] BLOCKING.
[ct=2834.808] YOU SEE DOUBLE-TEAMS, THIS IS A
[ct=2836.798] TRIPLE-TEAM THAT OPENED THE HOLE
[ct=2837.373] UP.
[ct=2840.382] AL: BASS WITH THE EXTRA POINT.
[ct=2841.707] TAKE A LOOK.
[ct=2848.052] KIRK: SPENCER BROWN, TORRENCE,
[ct=2848.372] CONNOR MCGOVERN, THEY TAKE AWAY
[ct=2849.026] THE INTERIOR.
[ct=2853.114] I DO NOT KNOW WHAT 11, DAVID
[ct=2853.836] LONG IS THINKING.
[ct=2855.628] LOSES HIS FOOTING AND DOES NOT
[ct=2858.387] FIT THE GAP AT ALL.
[ct=2862.340] JORDAN POYER TAKES IT FOR ANGLE.
[ct=2862.915] THAT IS SPEED FROM JAMES
[ct=2867.777] ONCE HE GETS TO THE OUTSIDE,
[ct=2868.338] THERE IS NO ONE LEFT TO SLOW HIM
[ct=2870.730] WHAT A PLAYER APPEARED AL: WE
[ct=2872.871] WERE TALKING ABOUT COOK,
[ct=2873.740] PROBABLY UNDERRATED.
[ct=2877.605] PROBABLY A LITTLE UNDERRATED
[ct=2878.943] BECAUSE YOU THINK HIS BROTHER,
[ct=2885.201] GALVIN -- DALVIN, WAS A STAR
[ct=2886.639] WITH MINNESOTA AND NOW IS ON THE
[ct=2886.934] DALLAS PRACTICE WHAT.
[ct=2891.919] KIRK: HIS FAMILY IS HERE.
[ct=2892.216] A LOT OF EMOTION FOR HIM TO COME
[ct=2894.299] BACK AND BE THE GUY.
[ct=2898.927] THAT IS 10 POINTS OFF TURNOVERS
[ct=2900.119] AND SEVEN MORE ON THE TURNOVER
[ct=2900.574] ON DOWNS.
[ct=2904.755] AL: A 17-POINT BUFFALO LEAD.
[ct=2906.994] TYLER BASS.
[ct=2910.741] KICKOFF NUMBER SIX.
[ct=2913.604] TOUCHBACK NUMBER SIX.
[ct=2915.082] EASTERN ON PRIME.
[ct=2918.159] KIRK: I THOUGHT YOU MADE A GREAT
[ct=2918.924] POINT WITH WHAT MIAMI FACED A
[ct=2919.140] WEEK AGO.
[ct=2923.089] A DIFFERENT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES
[ct=2923.822] BUT TO BE DOWN 14.
[ct=2926.080] THEY TALKED ABOUT HAVING TO COME
[ct=2928.744] JALEN RAMSEY SAID THEY HAD EACH
[ct=2930.115] OTHER'S BACK.
[ct=2931.725] HERE THEY ARE AGAIN.
[ct=2934.873] 17 DOWN IN THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=2937.910] LET'S SEE WHAT THEY DO TO TRY TO
[ct=2938.819] CLIMB BACK IN THE FOOTBALL GAME.
[ct=2942.333] AL: BUFFALO WAS ALSO DOWN 14
[ct=2943.571] LAST WEEK AT ONE POINT AND
[ct=2943.816] OVERCAME THAT.
[ct=2946.628] NO GAIN FOR WADDLE.
[ct=2951.730] TACKLED THERE AT THE LINE OF
[ct=2952.211] SCRIMMAGE BY CAM LEWIS.
[ct=2953.770] SECOND AND 10.
[ct=2956.681] KIRK: IT FEELS LIKE FROM UP HERE
[ct=2958.853] THAT BUFFALO IS PLAYING WITH A
[ct=2960.263] CHIP ON THEIR SHOULDER WITH SOME
[ct=2960.787] NEW FACES.
[ct=2963.375] THEY DO NOT HAVE THEIR SAFETY
[ct=2964.087] FROM LAST YEAR, PLAYING WITH
[ct=2965.937] RAPP AND HAMLET.
[ct=2968.412] YOU SAW CAM LEWIS MAKE A PLAY.
[ct=2973.210] THEY SEEM LIKE THEY ARE PLAYING
[ct=2974.432] WITH A BIT OF AN ATTITUDE, WHIC
[ct=2974.866] I LOVE.
[ct=2978.699] AL: PLAYING WITH A SHORT DECK
[ct=2979.108] AND DOMINATING.
[ct=2981.229] BLITZ COMING, LOOK OUT.
[ct=2983.857] THE PASS IS CAUGHT FOR A FIRST
[ct=2986.211] 12 YARDS.
[ct=2989.652] KIRK: THEY BRING THE BLITZ.
[ct=2991.825] SPECTER IS COMING.
[ct=2993.696] WATCH TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=2996.415] THEY ARE GETTING UPFIELD, VON
[ct=2996.719] MILLER.
[ct=2999.715] HE ALMOST GETS IN THE WAY OF
[ct=3000.147] THIS FOOTBALL.
[ct=3004.095] PERFECTLY TIMED TO GET THE BALL
[ct=3004.750] OUT QUICKLY WITH THE MIDDLE
[ct=3005.478] LINEBACKER ON THE BLITZ.
[ct=3007.937] DOES NOT HAVE TIME TO GET TO THE
[ct=3008.324] LACES.
[ct=3012.428] WITH THE SPEED OF ACHANE, HE
[ct=3013.209] GETS THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3015.886] AL: FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3020.389] AGAIN, THEY KEEP IT ON THE
[ct=3021.470] GROUND UP TO THE 46.
[ct=3025.524] PRETTY MUCH TAKING THE CROWD OUT
[ct=3025.792] OF THE GAME.
[ct=3029.872] THERE IS NO CHANCE FOR A 2-FOR-1
[ct=3032.585] FOR MIAMI.
[ct=3034.982] BUFFALO DEFERRED.
[ct=3038.145] THEY WILL GET THE BALL IN THE
[ct=3038.539] SECOND HALF.
[ct=3041.858] THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE TWO-
[ct=3046.285] THE BUFFALO BILLS DOMINATING IN
[ct=3046.285] MIAMI.
[ct=3046.913] ANG COMING UP AT THE
[ct=3047.354] BREAK.
[ct=3056.509] SO, LET'S SEE IF MIAMI CAN
[ct=3057.210] GET SOMETHING HAPPENING HERE IN
[ct=3061.576] THE LAST TWO MINUTES, 2ND DOWN
[ct=3061.792] AND SEVEN, WILL KEEP IT ON THE
[ct=3065.398] INTO THE 49 YARD LINE GOES
[ct=3065.792] ACHANE.
[ct=3069.607] SPECTOR TAKING THE PLACE OF
[ct=3072.432] BERNARD WHO GOT HURT.
[ct=3076.128] KIRK: SPECTOR HAS GOOD SPEED.
[ct=3077.486] HE PLAYED AT CLEMSON, WAS ASKED
[ct=3079.314] TO DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS,
[ct=3080.034] BLITZING, COVERING.
[ct=3083.573] SO, HE IS MORE THAN CAPABLE OF
[ct=3085.618] OWNING HIS -- OF HOLDING HIS
[ct=3086.220] OWN.
[ct=3087.789] CAN HE GET LINED UP IN THE RIGHT
[ct=3089.081] SPOT AND DEAL WITH THE SPEED AND
[ct=3089.658] THE CONFUSION THIS OFFENSE CAN
[ct=3090.096] CREATE?
[ct=3093.271] AL: THE CROWD IS GETTING A
[ct=3095.729] LITTLE RESTLESS WITH THE LACK OF
[ct=3097.126] URGENCY, DOWN BY 17.
[ct=3099.073] A COUPLE OF RUNS, 3RD DOWN AND
[ct=3102.222] 2, AND THAT WILL MOVE THE STICKS
[ct=3102.889] BUT IT IS JUST A SHORT GAME.
[ct=3104.756] SMITH MAKES THE CATCH.
[ct=3107.671] CROWD DOESN'T LIKE THE PLAY
[ct=3109.542] CALLING ON THIS DRIVE.
[ct=3112.459] KIRK: THEY GOT ALL THREE
[ct=3112.658] TIMEOUTS.
[ct=3114.255] THAT IS WHY YOU'RE NOT SEEING
[ct=3115.349] THE URGENCY BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.
[ct=3116.574] AND THEY NEED A TOUCHDOWN WHEN
[ct=3116.968] THE BILLS GET THE BALL.
[ct=3119.981] AL: ALMOST IF THEY ARE READING
[ct=3123.423] TO GET INTO THE LOCKER ROOM
[ct=3124.225] AND REGROUP AND TRY SOMETHING
[ct=3124.225] DIFFERENT.
[ct=3127.360] ACHANE, A SHORT GAME, UNDER A
[ct=3129.879] MINUTE, SECOND DOWN BUT AGAIN
[ct=3129.879] BUFFALO WILL GET THE BALL WHEN
[ct=3130.656] WE START THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=3134.719] KIRK: WE KEEP GOING BACK TO THIS
[ct=3136.147] TEAM WITH BUFFALO, ON A SHORT
[ct=3136.804] WEEK, SITTING BACK WITH THEIR
[ct=3140.331] TWO SAFETY IS TRYING TO TAKE
[ct=3142.142] AWAY THOSE EASY SHOTS, TRYING TO
[ct=3142.400] AFFECT THE TIMING AND THE
[ct=3142.615] RHYTHM.
[ct=3145.263] WITH THE SHORT UNDERNEATH
[ct=3147.769] PASSING, GETTING AFTER THESE
[ct=3149.997] IT HAS BEEN WORKING SO FAR.
[ct=3152.939] AL: ON TEAM WITH HILL AND
[ct=3155.674] OF YARDS AFTER THE CATCH.
[ct=3156.954] THE CLOCK RUNS,
[ct=3159.665] SHORT.
[ct=3159.881] A LITTLE TOSSED BACK HERE.
[ct=3164.376] THAT'S GOING TO GO NOWHERE AND
[ct=3165.719] THAT LOOK RELATABLE A LOT OF
[ct=3167.812] CONSTERNATION -- THAT WILL
[ct=3169.695] CREATE A LOT OF CONSTERNATION IN
[ct=3169.695] THE AUDIENCE.
[ct=3171.289] 3RD DOWN AND 12.
[ct=3175.066] KIRK: I'M SURPRISED THESE
[ct=3175.066] TIMEOUTS ARE NOT BEING USED.
[ct=3179.114] ED ED OLIVER IN THIS MIDDLE OF
[ct=3180.678] THIS DEFENSE.
[ct=3181.455] WHETHER HE'S ON THE RIGHT SIDE
[ct=3182.466] OR THE LEFT SIDE, THAT TIME
[ct=3184.749] BEGINS I CO
[ct=3186.948] BEGINS I CANBERG.
[ct=3188.203] AL: THEY WILL USE THE TIMEOUT
[ct=3189.981] BUT :32,
[ct=3200.792] AL: KIRK, THIS IS THE COUNT --
[ct=3201.827] YOU TELL ME.
[ct=3202.538] THIS IS THE KIND OF DRIVE THAT
[ct=3203.371] YOU RUN OUT THE CLOCK.
[ct=3206.789] KIRK: THE TWO MINUTE WARNING,
[ct=3208.306] NOT USING THE TIMEOUTS.
[ct=3208.638] I THINK EVERYONE'S KIND OF
[ct=3211.786] SURPRISE, NOT TO MENTION THEY
[ct=3212.905] HAD TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS DRIVE
[ct=3213.547] WITH BUFFALO GETTING THE BALL.
[ct=3217.313] AL: LIKE THEY’
[ct=3217.589] AL: LIKE THEY'RE PLAYING
[ct=3217.922] DEFENSE.
[ct=3220.198] AND IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW.
[ct=3220.497] AFRAID SOMETHING BAD IS GOING TO
[ct=3220.497] HAPPEN.
[ct=3222.124] TUS FL
[ct=3224.004] TUS A FLUSHED OUT.
[ct=3226.763] HE'S GOING TO KEEP IT AND RUN
[ct=3227.566] WITH IT AND GET THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3230.589] THE CROWD LIKES THAT BUT THAT
[ct=3232.072] SECONDARY DID ITS JOB.
[ct=3237.971] GOT HILL OUT THERE AND SMITH, A
[ct=3239.014] LOT OF GUYS THAT CAN REALLY BUST
[ct=3239.782] IT OPEN.
[ct=3243.074] KIRK: TYREEK HILL CHECKING OUT
[ct=3246.412] AND YOU HAVE GOT DEBOSE WHO MADE
[ct=3248.278] A MISTAKE NOT GETTING HIS HEAD
[ct=3250.434] TURNED AROUND AND THAT COST OF
[ct=3250.434] TURNOVER.
[ct=3252.490] THE REASON THEY GO TO THE BIGGER
[ct=3253.619] RECEIVERS AS THEY HAVE TO TRY TO
[ct=3254.021] GET THE BALL DOWNFIELD.
[ct=3256.212] ALSO ROBBIE CHOSEN IN AGAIN.
[ct=3259.133] AL: 27 SECONDS.
[ct=3264.518] THAT'S WILSON IN MOTION.
[ct=3266.127] CATCHES IT.
[ct=3269.879] GETS TO THE 29 YARD LINE.
[ct=3271.488] THEY HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS.
[ct=3275.196] CLOCK RUNS A COUPLE OF SECONDS
[ct=3275.553] FURTHER.
[ct=3278.872] THEN THEY CALL IT RIGHT HERE.
[ct=3280.587] SECOND AND 4.
[ct=3285.815] KIRK: REALLY, YOU WERE TALKING
[ct=3285.815] ABOUT YARDS AFTER THE CATCH.
[ct=3289.034] THE PROBLEM IS THAT BUFFALO IS
[ct=3290.898] DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB OF
[ct=3292.073] RUNNING THE FOOTBALL, TAKING
[ct=3293.481] AWAY SOME OF THE SPACE THEY ARE
[ct=3294.041] USED TO WORKING WITH UNDERNEATH
[ct=3294.440] THERE.
[ct=3295.175] DIDN’
[ct=3298.752] DIDN'T WE HAVE TWO QUARTERBACKS
[ct=3299.334] LAST WEEK THROW FOR OVER 300
[ct=3299.552] YARDS?
[ct=3301.031] AL: THAT'S IT.
[ct=3305.135] TUA AND MATTHEW STAFFORD LOSING
[ct=3305.426] THE BATTLE AGAINST DETROIT.
[ct=3306.674] THAT'S INTERESTING.
[ct=3307.949] TWO GUYS.
[ct=3310.545] THERE WAS MORE RUNNING IN THE
[ct=3311.002] FIRST WEEK THEN THERE HAS BEEN
[ct=3314.843] IN YEARS AND LESS PASSING.
[ct=3315.140] AGAIN, THAT IS A TINY SAMPLE
[ct=3315.457] SIZE.
[ct=3318.017] KIRK: WE'LL SEE.
[ct=3320.358] BUT WE ARE SEEING IT AGAIN
[ct=3321.062] TONIGHT WITH BUFFALO'S DEFENSE.
[ct=3325.300] FORCING THE SHORT PASSING GAME,
[ct=3326.340] YARDS AFTER THE CATCH, MAKE YOU
[ct=3327.023] HAVE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=3334.364] AL: AND MIAMI'S RUN 36 PLAYS,
[ct=3336.568] 20 RUNS, 16 PASSES.
[ct=3338.900] 2ND AND 4.
[ct=3341.797] FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=3343.303] THAT'S CALL.
[ct=3346.608] -- THAT'S CAUGHT.
[ct=3349.849] HILL TACKLED AND YOU HAVE THE
[ct=3351.089] CLOCK STOPPING AT :16.
[ct=3353.989] AND YOU ARE NOW OUT OF TIMEOUTS.
[ct=3355.732] YOU BRING IN YOUR FIELD GOAL
[ct=3356.277] KICKER WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY
[ct=3356.907] SOMETHING THEY WILL NEED HERE.
[ct=3359.566] SANDERS HAS MADE HIS LAST SIX.
[ct=3365.039] HE'S A GOOD ONE. KIRK: WELL,
[ct=3366.332] THERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE
[ct=3367.953] SEEN IN THIS FIRST HALF.
[ct=3368.243] TO GET THE BALL OUT IN A HURRY
[ct=3370.647] AND YOU GET IT TO YOUR GUY,
[ct=3371.447] TYREEK HILL AND HIS SOON AS HE
[ct=3372.250] CATCHES THE BALL YOU HAVE TWO
[ct=3377.456] OR THREE BUFFALO DEFENDERS NOT
[ct=3378.696] ALLOWING HIM TO GET AN ANGLE TO
[ct=3380.215] GET OUT IN THE SPACE.
[ct=3382.537] THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY DIALED
[ct=3383.745] UP THIS WEEK AND HOPING TO TAKE
[ct=3384.508] AWAY THE POTENTIAL WITH THE BIG
[ct=3386.707] PLAY LIKE YOU SAID IF THEY THROW
[ct=3387.037] IT UNDERNEATH.
[ct=3389.647] LET HIM TRY TO GET LOOSE.
[ct=3393.580] THREE WHITE JERSEYS THEIR
[ct=3394.368] RUNNING THE BALL.
[ct=3397.796] NOW HE'S GOT TO CAREFUL WITHOUT
[ct=3397.796] THE TIMEOUTS.
[ct=3400.496] GOT TO GET OUT IN A HURRY.
[ct=3401.647] AL: EXACTLY.
[ct=3406.829] HILL IS WIDE RIGHT.
[ct=3407.237] AND YOU HAVE A TIMEOUT TAKEN BY
[ct=3407.519] THE DEFENSE.
[ct=3408.704] SEAN MCDERMOTT.
[ct=3412.797] A LOT OF SUCCESS IN BUFFALO.
[ct=3415.680] HE SAYS, HE'S GOT TO BE
[ct=3418.698] OPTIMIST.
[ct=3420.527] BUT HE HAS BEEN IN THE PLAY OF
[ct=3421.658] SIX TIMES IN SEVEN SEASON AND
[ct=3422.077] HELPED TURN THAT FRANCHISE
[ct=3422.335] AROUND.
[ct=3425.366] KIRK: THE PREVIOUS 20 YEARS,
[ct=3425.935] THEY'D ONLY BEEN TO THE PLAYOFFS
[ct=3429.238] A COUPLE TIMES.
[ct=3431.378] I THINK HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB.
[ct=3431.378] IT IS A MATTER OF TAKING THE
[ct=3432.332] NEXT STEP.
[ct=3433.472] I LIKE THE FACT HE TALKED WITH
[ct=3434.864] US ABOUT GOING BACK TO BEING THE
[ct=3436.318] HEAD COACH AND BEING THERE FOR
[ct=3437.060] THE TEAM.
[ct=3438.123] LAST YEAR KIND OF SET THE BAR
[ct=3442.182] AND SHOWING THE ASSISTANTS AND
[ct=3443.689] SHOWING THE TEAM AS THE PLAY
[ct=3445.100] CALLER ON THE DEFENSE BUT IT
[ct=3446.404] TAKES TIME TO GET THAT READY.
[ct=3447.730] NOW HE IS RELYING ON BOBBY
[ct=3451.303] BABBAGE AND BRANDON BEANE THE
[ct=3453.096] GM.
[ct=3456.265] BUT THEY FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS
[ct=3456.265] TEAM.
[ct=3457.283] LIKE I SAID, IF THEY CAN
[ct=3459.584] MAINTAIN THIS COLLECTIVE CHIP
[ct=3460.371] THEY ARE PLAYING WITH, THERE IS
[ct=3461.103] A REASON FOR OPTIMISM.
[ct=3464.131] AL: COMING DOWN HERE ON THE
[ct=3465.597] ROAD, HOT NIGHT.
[ct=3467.041] LEADING BY 17.
[ct=3470.333] TUA TO THE OUTSIDE AND STEPPING
[ct=3470.858] OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 15 YARD
[ct=3472.514] LINE IS SMITH.
[ct=3475.359] NOW AT :12.
[ct=3479.950] AGAIN, WITH NO TIMEOUTS YOU HAVE
[ct=3480.958] TO WORK THE EDGES OR THE END
[ct=3481.404] ZONE.
[ct=3484.494] KIRK: I THINK BUFFALO AGAIN
[ct=3485.972] TRYING TO KEEP IT IN FRONT.
[ct=3486.760] THEY PROBABLY GAVE UP A FEW MORE
[ct=3489.939] NOW TUA POTENTIALLY HAS A COUPLE
[ct=3492.285] OF SHOTS INTO THE END ZONE HERE.
[ct=3495.499] AL: 12TH PLAY OF A DRIVE.
[ct=3498.004] FIVE RUNS, SIX PASSES.
[ct=3498.300] [WHISTLE]
[ct=3502.094] NOW YOU GOT ANOTHER TIMEOUT.
[ct=3505.595] >> FINAL TIMEOUT.
[ct=3508.347] AL: BUFFALO TAKES THIS ONE,
[ct=3510.870] AFTER THEY LOOKED AT THE ALIG
[ct=3512.450] NMENT.
[ct=3514.769] STEVE ROSS IS THE OWNER OF THE
[ct=3514.769] MIAMI DOLPHINS.
[ct=3519.628] USUALLY SUCCESSFUL IN THE REAL
[ct=3521.914] ESTATE WORLD AND OF COURSE
[ct=3523.516] CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, MANAGING
[ct=3523.929] GENERAL PARTNER.
[ct=3526.790] HE'S WATCHED HIS TEAM GO TO THE
[ct=3531.544] PLAYOFFS LAST TWO -- LAST
[ct=3532.247] YEAR THEY LOST TO BUFFALO AT THE
[ct=3532.690] END OF THE SEASON HERE IT HAD
[ct=3535.002] THEY WON, THEY WOULD NOT HAVE
[ct=3535.620] HAD TO GO TO KANSAS CITY AND GO
[ct=3540.410] TO ICE STATION ZEBRA FOR THAT
[ct=3540.410] WILD CARD GAME.
[ct=3541.935] IN WHICH KANSAS CITY WON.
[ct=3544.795] BUT THAT WAS A VERY VERY COSTLY
[ct=3546.535] KIRK: I JUS
[ct=3550.318] KIRK: I JT FELT LIKE THE LAST
[ct=3551.111] THREE OR FOUR WEEKS OF THE
[ct=3552.331] SEASON THEY WERE LIMPING HOME.
[ct=3554.615] THEY DID NOT LOOK LIKE, THAT WAS
[ct=3556.119] A BIG EMPHASIS FOR THEM IS BEING
[ct=3557.048] ABLE TO BE THE SAME TEAM FOR 17
[ct=3557.494] WEEKS.
[ct=3561.788] KIRK: LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, HOT
[ct=3563.054] START, NOT SO HOT FINISH.
[ct=3565.986] TUA TO THE OUTSIDE AND THROWS
[ct=3566.758] THAT ONE AWAY.
[ct=3568.650] THIRD DOWN.
[ct=3570.910] NOW YOU GOT :08.
[ct=3575.487] AND, OF COURSE, THE BILLS ARE
[ct=3575.920] TAKING THE END ZONE AWAY.
[ct=3577.360] AS BEST THEY CAN.
[ct=3579.294] THEY WILL SEND IN THE FIELD GOAL
[ct=3579.614] UNIT.
[ct=3583.438] SANDERS WON LAST WEEK'S GAME AT
[ct=3583.694] THE GUN.
[ct=3585.041] THAT WAS THE ONLY GAME IN
[ct=3586.316] THAT WAS THE ONLY GAME I--
[ct=3589.095] THE ONLY TIME IN THE GAME THAT
[ct=3589.567] THE DOLPHINS HAD THE LEAD.
[ct=3592.173] 0:00.
[ct=3595.176] KICK THE 52 YARDER.
[ct=3597.988] THIS IS A CHIP SHOT FOR HIM.
[ct=3598.725] 34 YARDS.
[ct=3607.778] AND THE KICK IS GOOD.
[ct=3618.070] SO, LAST YEAR, WEEK 18, CALEBL
[ct=3621.899] SO, LAST YEAR, WEEK 18, CALEB WH
[ct=3621.899] THAT NIGHT WILL TELL YOU.
[ct=3627.569] WITH :04 TO GO, IT'S 14 POINT GA
[ct=3629.387] ME.
[ct=3632.252] SO AGAIN, THE DOLPHINS IN A
[ct=3636.979] SITUATION THAT THEY WERE IN LAST
[ct=3637.432] WEEK AGAINST THE JACKSONVILLE
[ct=3637.957] JAGUARS.
[ct=3645.900] SO, WILL WE SEE ANOTHER
[ct=3645.900] TOUCHBACK?
[ct=3647.558] MAYBE NOT THIS TIME.
[ct=3652.350] HE MAY WANT THE CLOCK TO RUN OUT
[ct=3656.129] WITH THE SHORT -- I HAVE AN IDEA
[ct=3656.311] AT THE END OF THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=3656.721] I HAVE TWO.
[ct=3660.190] NUMBER ONE, THE TOUCHBACK COMES
[ct=3661.249] AFTER THE 35 YARD LINE.
[ct=3664.506] NOT A BAD IDEA.
[ct=3666.991] OR MAKE THE KICKER GO BACK TO
[ct=3667.395] THE 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=3669.410] KIRK: THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT.
[ct=3671.150] AL: THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT.
[ct=3675.038] KIRK: I THINK EVERYBODY, THINK
[ct=3675.861] ABOUT WHAT BUFFALO DEALT WITH,
[ct=3678.939] YOU TAKE THE 10 POINT LEAD LAST
[ct=3680.197] WEEK THEY THINK THEY'RE IN GOOD
[ct=3680.197] SHAPE.
[ct=3683.743] A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THE
[ct=3684.835] ANSWER IS, WE KICK IT INTO THE
[ct=3686.490] END ZONE AND LET THEM START THE
[ct=3686.490] 30.
[ct=3689.141] AL: ABSOLUTE.
[ct=3690.159] THE AVERAGE START LAST YEAR IS
[ct=3693.983] -- WAS AT THE 26.
[ct=3694.352] WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?
[ct=3696.843] THAT IS THE END OF THE FIRST
[ct=3699.400] HALF DOMINATED BY THE VISITORS.
[ct=3705.223] TUA HAD 13 COMPLETIONS, 18
[ct=3705.223] ATTEMPTS, 97 YARDS.
[ct=3710.922] 24-10, AND WE GO TO KAYLEE.
[ct=3715.088] KAYLEE: YOUR OFFENSE LIKES TO
[ct=3715.315] SAY THAT EVERYBODY EATS.
[ct=3718.246] >> WELL, EVERYONE JUST
[ct=3719.454] THEIR JOB.
[ct=3720.182] WE GOT TO CONTINUE WITH THIS.
[ct=3723.490] THIS TEAM IS POTENT ON OFFENSE.
[ct=3723.742] AND SPECIAL TEAMS.
[ct=3726.485] KAYLEE: BUT ON DEFENSE EVEN WITH
[ct=3729.032] THE INJURIES THAT YOU HAVE, HAVE
[ct=3731.226] YOU BE -- HOW IF YOU BEEN ABLE
[ct=3731.675] TO NEUTRALIZE MIAMI'S BIG-PLAY
[ct=3732.013] ABILITY?
[ct=3736.719] >> GUYS ARE MAKING PLAYS,
[ct=3737.475] GETTING THE BALL MAYBE
[ct=3737.731] THEY CAN GET
[ct=3738.965] THAT IS WHAT THEY HAVE GOT TO
[ct=3738.965] DO.
[ct=3741.718] AL: BILLS WILL GET THE BALL.
[ct=3744.339] SANDERS TO KICK IT OFF.
[ct=3748.649] EVERY KICK OFF TONIGHT HAS
[ct=3749.472] RESULTED IN A TOUCHBACK.
[ct=3751.296] THIS TIME WE’
[ct=3752.024] THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO SEE A
[ct=3752.265] RUN BACK.
[ct=3756.258] STOP THE PRESSES, FROM THE 4
[ct=3757.851] YARD LINE AND BRINGING IT BACK
[ct=3760.173] OUT TO THE 27 YARD LINE IS. RAY
[ct=3765.343] MOMENTS AGO, KAYLLE ON THE
[ct=3765.715] FIELD WITH MIKE MCDANIEL.
[ct=3769.063] KAYLEE: YOU ARE DOWN DOUBLE
[ct=3769.063] DIGITS FOR HIS SECOND GAME IN A
[ct=3769.339] ROW.
[ct=3772.996] >> YOU KNOW, THERE WAS
[ct=3772.996] CONSTRUCTIVE ENERGY.
[ct=3776.011] I THINK OUR FOOTBALL TEAM IS
[ct=3776.011] SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW.
[ct=3782.939] THE TURNOVER BATTLE, WE HAVE TO
[ct=3783.637] BE A LOT CLEANER AND HOW WE
[ct=3784.113] OPERATE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SOME
[ct=3786.322] PLAYS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BALL.
[ct=3787.828] AND WE DIDN'T
[ct=3789.021] EASY.
[ct=3792.175] KAYLEE: DID YOU SEE THE RESPONSE
[ct=3793.261] AND THE CHALLENGE FROM YOUR
[ct=3794.147] QUARTERBACK DURING THE HALF THAT
[ct=3794.538] YOU SAW LAST WEEK.
[ct=3796.051] >> ABSOLUTELY.
[ct=3799.074] I THINK THERE WAS COMFORT TO A
[ct=3802.592] DEGREE IN THE FACT THAT THIS IS
[ct=3803.232] NOT UNCHARTED TERRITORY FOR
[ct=3803.671] SECOND GAME.
[ct=3807.456] GUYS WERE PRETTY -- OFF IN THIS
[ct=3809.445] SITUATION.
[ct=3810.121] WE'LL SEE WHAT WE DO WITH IT.
[ct=3812.089] AL: ALL RIGHT.
[ct=3816.264] THAT WAS MCDANIEL MOMENTS AGO.
[ct=3816.635] THEY START THIS DRIVE, THE BILLS
[ct=3818.380] DO, TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=3819.939] STAYING IN BOUNDS.
[ct=3823.779] FOR EXTRA YARDAGE IS DALTON
[ct=3823.779] KINCAID.
[ct=3826.000] MIKE JUST SAID YOU ARE DOWN 3-0
[ct=3828.980] IN THE TURNOVERS BUT OFFICIALLY
[ct=3831.299] IT IS ONLY TWO, BUT THE FOURTH
[ct=3833.434] DOWN THING DOES NOT COUNT AS A
[ct=3834.046] TURNOVER BUT IT MIGHT AS WELL.
[ct=3837.284] KIRK: THAT IS 17 POINTS, LIKE WE
[ct=3838.012] TALKED ABOUT.
[ct=3839.456] HE SAID WHAT WE SAID.
[ct=3840.697] TAKE CARE THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=3841.839] FIRST THING THEY GOT TO DO
[ct=3843.212] TACKLE.
[ct=3844.681] GET A STOP HERE AGAINST JOSH WHO
[ct=3846.094] IS AN OFFENSIVE LINE THAT HAD A
[ct=3850.078] -- AGAINST JOSH ALLEN WHO HAD
[ct=3850.780] AN OFFENSIVE LINE THAT HAD A
[ct=3851.246] HECK OF A FIRST HALF.
[ct=3853.024] AL: SECOND AND 1.
[ct=3856.623] GET ABOUT FIVE.
[ct=3859.609] JAMES COOK NOW HAVING A HECK OF
[ct=3863.370] A NIGHT, HAS CARRIED THE BALL
[ct=3864.139] SIX TIMES FOR 65 YARDS.
[ct=3867.483] KIRK: BIG THING THAT HE LIKES TO
[ct=3869.105] DO, WE SAW IT LAST YEAR WERE
[ct=3869.553] THEN WHAT WOULD BRING IN DAVID
[ct=3869.866] EDWARDS.
[ct=3874.607] ON THE LEFT SIDE, ALEC ANDERSON
[ct=3876.388] AND HIS SECOND YEAR OUT OF UCLA
[ct=3877.320] GIVES HIM THAT SHORT YARDAGE AND
[ct=3878.440] I LOVE THE PATIENCE.
[ct=3881.616] JAMES COOK TALKED WITH THIS
[ct=3884.068] COACH IS HE MISSED A FEW PLAYS
[ct=3884.068] LAST WEEK.
[ct=3885.724] THE VISION WAS NOT THERE.
[ct=3888.853] HE HAS SOME GOOD ONES AND BAD
[ct=3888.853] ONES BUT TONIGHT HE'S BEEN VERY
[ct=3889.159] GOOD.
[ct=3891.932] AL: QUICK STAR OUTSIDE.
[ct=3894.424] COMING BACK INSIDE, PICKING U
[ct=3894.880] FEW.
[ct=3895.335] CURTIS SAMUEL TAKES IT TO THE 50
[ct=3898.350] SECOND AND 7.
[ct=3900.506] DAVID LONG MAKES THE STOP.
[ct=3901.378] THERE IS WEAVER.
[ct=3905.696] WEAVER AND MCDANIEL GO BACK TO
[ct=3906.508] THE HOUSTON TEXANS A NUMBER OF
[ct=3906.749] YEARS AGO.
[ct=3910.940] KIRK: FAMILIARITY, OF COURSE.
[ct=3912.065] AND WE TALKED AT THE BEGINNING
[ct=3913.767] OF THE BROADCAST HOW ANTHONY
[ct=3917.888] WEAVER REALLY BEING A FORMER
[ct=3918.754] PLAYER WITH THE RAVENS, FITS IN
[ct=3921.346] PERFECTLY WITH THE CULTURE THAT
[ct=3922.579] MIKE MCDANIEL HAS HERE.
[ct=3933.749] AL: 2ND AND 7 FROM MIDFIELD AND
[ct=3933.749] SLIPPING FROM THE LOCAL WAS
[ct=3934.087] JAMES COOK.
[ct=3938.500] JORDYN BROOKS, TOOK THE LOGO AT
[ct=3939.775] MIDFIELD AND IS MORE SLIPPERY
[ct=3940.164] THAN THE GRASS ITSELF.
[ct=3943.186] KIRK: HERE IS A BIG OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=3944.030] THIS IS WHAT I'M SURE THEY
[ct=3944.995] TALKED ABOUT AT HALFTIME.
[ct=3947.846] IF THEY ARE MIAMI, WE ARE DOWN
[ct=3948.277] 14.
[ct=3948.277] WE WERE HERE LAST WEEK.
[ct=3951.398] PART OF BEING ABLE TO FIGHT BACK
[ct=3952.497] AND WIN A FOOTBALL GAME IS IT
[ct=3954.872] SHOWS A NEW GROUP, HEY, WE CAN
[ct=3954.872] DO THIS.
[ct=3958.224] GET IN THERE AT HALFTIME, WE
[ct=3959.504] WERE HERE LAST WEEK.
[ct=3959.956] LET'S DO THIS.
[ct=3960.876] LET'S GET A STOP AND GET THE
[ct=3961.245] BALL BACK TO TUA.
[ct=3965.114] AL: TIMEOUT IS CALLED BY THE
[ct=3965.381] DOLPHINS.
[ct=3969.693] SOME OTHER THINGS YOU DO NOT
[ct=3971.157] WANT TO HAVE TO DO DOWN BY 14 IS
[ct=3975.615] WASTE OR USE WHATEVER YOU WANT
[ct=3976.531] TO CALL IT A TIMEOUT IN THE
[ct=3977.377] FIRST COUPLE MINUTES OF THE
[ct=3978.799] THIRD CORPORATE KIRK:
[ct=3981.027] THIRD CORPORATE K-- THE THIRD
[ct=3987.523] KIRK: 2 GUYS ON THE FIELD.
[ct=3989.094] THEY COULD NOT AFFORD THE
[ct=3989.094] PENALTY, SO THEY HAD TO USE THE
[ct=3989.525] TIMEOUT.
[ct=3992.319] I’
[ct=3996.401] I'M SURE A BIG PART OF A
[ct=3998.712] DIVISIONAL MATCH UP EARLY IN THE
[ct=4000.834] YEAR, A BIG PART OF MCDANIEL'S,
[ct=4002.092] SOME OF THE LEADERS ON THE TEAM,
[ct=4003.931] WE HAVE TO MATCH THE INTENSITY
[ct=4004.455] THIS BILLS TEAM SHOWED UP WITH
[ct=4006.334] LET'S NOT WAIT.
[ct=4008.611] LET'S TAKE THE FIGHT TO THEM.
[ct=4011.434] ON OUR TURF.
[ct=4012.971] WE ARE HERE IN MIAMI.
[ct=4015.654] DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THAT IN THE
[ct=4017.665] AL: MM-MM.
[ct=4020.268] THIRD AND 7.
[ct=4023.539] BRINGING THAT THIRD DOWN
[ct=4028.780] KIRK: GET THE ROOKIE ROBINSON UP
[ct=4029.103] TO THE LEFT.
[ct=4030.074] HE HAS GOT GREAT SPEED.
[ct=4033.541] AL: CAN HE GET THROUGH?
[ct=4035.729] ALLEN IS CHASED.
[ct=4039.110] ALLEN THROWS AND ALLEN THROWS UP
[ct=4040.902] BEHIND MARCUS SCALING.
[ct=4044.965] CAME OVER FROM KANSAS CITY.
[ct=4045.858] FULLER COVERING.
[ct=4046.786] PRESSURE WAS PUT ON ALAN.
[ct=4046.786] AND MY
[ct=4048.312] AND MIAMI
[ct=4051.218] SECOND HALF STOP.
[ct=4054.168] KIRK: THEY SHOWED BLITZ, AND END
[ct=4055.676] UP BACKING OUT, A LITTLE TWIST
[ct=4055.676] WITH ROBINSON.
[ct=4059.821] HE WOWED A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH
[ct=4060.740] HIS SPEED AND WHAT HE CAN DO,
[ct=4062.047] THE ROOKIE OUT OF PENN STATE.
[ct=4063.888] THAT TIME JUST RUSHING JOSH
[ct=4065.546] ALLEN, NOT ALLOWING HIM TO MAKE
[ct=4067.295] THAT ACCURATE THROW AGAINST THE
[ct=4068.290] DOLPHINS DEFENSE OFF THE FIELD.
[ct=4069.770] AL: ROBINSON THE FIRST ROUND
[ct=4070.322] PICK.
[ct=4073.052] A PUNT HERE FROM MARTIN.
[ct=4076.837] FAIR CATCH IS CALLED FOR AND
[ct=4078.367] MADE AT THE 11 YARD LINE BY BER
[ct=4084.935] KIRK: IT WAS A TOUGH FIRST HALF
[ct=4085.579] OF THE MIAMI OFFENSE.
[ct=4085.919] NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND WAYS TO
[ct=4087.364] GET TYREEK HILL THE FOOTBALL AS
[ct=4088.317] OFTEN AS YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY.
[ct=4088.826] SIMILAR TO LAST WEEK.
[ct=4090.931] AND A LOT OF THIS HAS BEEN, YOU
[ct=4092.900] SEE MAN CAVERNS BUT A LOT OF IT
[ct=4096.376] - -MAN COVERAGE, BUT A LOT OF IT
[ct=4097.929] HAS BEEN ZONE.
[ct=4100.944] THEY BEEN KEEPING SAFETY'S
[ct=4101.867] OVERTOP TO HELP THEM.
[ct=4102.884] REMEMBER LAST WEEK AGAINST
[ct=4104.373] JACKSONVILLE, JUST WHEN YOU
[ct=4105.171] THINK JACKSONVILLE IS DOING A
[ct=4105.659] GREAT JOB, BANG.
[ct=4110.807] ONE PLAY AND YOU SEE AN 80 YARD
[ct=4112.056] TOUCHDOWN BY TYREEK HILL.
[ct=4114.366] THAT IS WHAT MIAMI IS BANKING
[ct=4115.753] ON, FINDING WAYS TO GET 17 AND
[ct=4116.981] 10 LOOSE.
[ct=4120.131] AL: FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH, LESTER
[ct=4120.480] COTTON IS IN PLACE OF ROBERT
[ct=4120.814] JONES.
[ct=4123.994] SEE IF THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE
[ct=4124.432] UP FRONT.
[ct=4129.194] WILLIAMS MAKES THE TACKLE ON
[ct=4134.057] KAYLEE: GUYS, WE JUST LEARNED
[ct=4135.922] THAT MIAMI IS LEFT GUARD ROB
[ct=4136.315] JONES IS QUESTIONABLE BECAUSE OF
[ct=4137.187] A SHOULDER INJURY.
[ct=4138.120] THAT IS WHY YOU SEE LESTER
[ct=4138.120] COTTON.
[ct=4142.208] HE HAS HIS HELMET IN HIS HAND
[ct=4143.334] BUT IN A LONG CONVERSATION WITH
[ct=4144.614] A TRAINER AND WE GOT
[ct=4145.317] CONFIRMATION FROM THE BILLS THAT
[ct=4146.444] THEIR MIDDLE LINEBACKER, THEIR
[ct=4149.271] LEADING TACKLER BERNARD WILL NOT
[ct=4150.873] RETURN TO THIS GAME.
[ct=4152.569] BECAUSE OF A PECTORAL INT
[ct=4153.605] JURY.
[ct=4156.627] AL: HE WENT OUT WITH THAT IN THE
[ct=4159.966] BUT THEY HAVE WITHSTOOD ABOUT
[ct=4160.703] EVERYTHING ON DEFENSE.
[ct=4167.043] PASS -- ACHANE, HE'LL GALLOP
[ct=4168.341] HIS WAY FOR A FIRST DOWN PAST
[ct=4168.718] THE 20 YARD LINE.
[ct=4173.217] KIRK: SOME SPACE FINALLY FOR
[ct=4174.111] ONE OF THEIR SPEEDSTERS TO WORK
[ct=4174.111] WITH.
[ct=4174.757] HE LOOKS DOWN FIELD.
[ct=4178.885] GOOD LOOK AT HIGH SKY TO GET A
[ct=4179.929] FEEL FOR THE LEFT-HAND SIDE.
[ct=4181.534] SEE THE BILLS SINKING.
[ct=4184.326] THAT IS THE PLAN, YOU SAW HIM
[ct=4184.767] LOSE HIS FEEDING, CHRISTIAN
[ct=4185.095] BENFORD.
[ct=4188.618] EYES DOWNFIELD.
[ct=4188.618] CHECK IT.
[ct=4190.965] THAT IS BEEN A BIG EVAN:.
[ct=4192.312] REMEMBER ON OUR CALL WITH MIKE
[ct=4194.352] MCDANIEL, HE SAID WE WANT YOU TO
[ct=4195.309] FEEL COMFORTABLE CHECKING IT
[ct=4196.571] YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ALWAYS THROW
[ct=4198.627] IT AND TUA HAS REALLY BOUGHT
[ct=4198.643] INTO THAT.
[ct=4202.204] AL: ON THE GROUND HERE LOOKING
[ct=4202.625] FOR SOME SPACE.
[ct=4203.712] FOR ACHANE.
[ct=4206.088] KIRK: THINK THAT IS WORTH
[ct=4207.925] WATCHING WITH COTTON IN FOR
[ct=4210.597] JONES WITH THE INJURY.
[ct=4211.258] BECAUSE THEIR STARTING LEFT
[ct=4215.758] GUARD IS ON THE PUTT, HE'S
[ct=4216.920] UNABLE TO PLAY.
[ct=4217.612] YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY DOWN ONE OF
[ct=4220.111] YOUR THIRD LEFT GUARD AND ED
[ct=4223.995] OLIVER HAD HIS WAY MANY TIMES OF
[ct=4224.650] ROBERT JONES IN THAT FIRST HALF.
[ct=4228.940] SO KEEP AN EYE ON THE INTERIOR
[ct=4229.799] OF THAT MIAMI OFFENSIVE LINE HE
[ct=4230.972] DACRON JONES AND ED OLIVER.
[ct=4234.732] AND YOU HAVE COME A LAMB COMING
[ct=4234.732] OFF THE BENCH.
[ct=4235.360] NUMBER 70.
[ct=4239.102] -- KEMBA LAMB.
[ct=4243.496] 2ND AND 6, ON THE GROUND TO GET
[ct=4244.601] UP TO THE 30 YARD LINE TO SET UP
[ct=4248.031] A THIRD AND MEDIUM.
[ct=4250.435] SO THE MIAMI DOLPHINS, 23 RUNS
[ct=4250.845] ALREADY.
[ct=4251.554] WILLIAMS MAKES THE STOP IT KIRK:
[ct=4255.174] YOU HEAR SOME OF THE MEMBERS IN
[ct=4256.276] THE BACKGROUND FOR SOME OF THE
[ct=4258.849] BOOING FROM THE FANS.
[ct=4259.842] THEY WANT MIKE MCDANIEL TO GIVE
[ct=4261.728] TYREEK HILL THE BALL.
[ct=4264.394] IT IS TOUGH TO DO WITH THOSE
[ct=4264.394] SAFETY'S BACK.
[ct=4267.269] THAT IS WHY THEY'RE RUNNING THE
[ct=4267.613] FOOTBALL.
[ct=4269.574] THEIR ANSWER IS RUN THE
[ct=4272.467] CREATE SPACE UNDERNEATH, AND TRY
[ct=4272.467] TO HAVE THAT YARDS AFTER T
[ct=4272.962] CATCH.
[ct=4274.709] A BIG THIRD DOWN.
[ct=4277.685] AL: 3RD AND 5.
[ct=4279.554] JEFF WILSON 23 IN THE GAME.
[ct=4288.955] TUA PRESSURED LOOKED OUT,
[ct=4290.602] FORCED TO THROW AND IT WILL BE
[ct=4290.602] DEPICT OFF ALONG THE SIDELINE!
[ct=4293.140] INGRAM UNTOUCHED.
[ct=4296.527] SO, TUA UNDER PRESSURE TRYING TO
[ct=4298.718] THROW IT AWAY NOT FAR ENOUGH.
[ct=4301.410] AND ON RUN BACK FOR A SCORE.
[ct=4304.668] HE PUT THE HEAT ON.
[ct=4312.291] LESTER COTTON COMING IT LEFT
[ct=4312.291] GUARD.
[ct=4315.741] YOU ALSO JUST HAD A BACKUP LEFT
[ct=4318.270] TACKLE AND NUMBER70.
[ct=4322.668] SO YOU HAVE TWO NEW PLAYERS TO
[ct=4322.990] OPEN THE DRIVE UP ON THE LEFT
[ct=4323.798] SIDE AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE
[ct=4324.809] THE PRESSURE COMES FROM.
[ct=4327.989] AND I THINK TUA DID EVERYTHING
[ct=4329.425] HE COULD TO TRY TO BE ABLE TO
[ct=4329.780] THROW THIS BALL AWAY.
[ct=4331.478] HE JUST DOESN'T GET ENOUGH ON
[ct=4336.097] THROWS IT UP IN THE AIR, AND
[ct=4336.913] THERE ONCE AGAIN IS A BUFFALO
[ct=4336.913] BILL.
[ct=4340.161] INGRAM MADE A GREAT PLAY EARLY
[ct=4341.189] WITH AN INTERCEPTION.
[ct=4341.899] THIS TIME STEPS IN FRONT AND HAS
[ct=4342.989] A PICK SIX.
[ct=4344.899] AL: PLAYED FOR THE BUFFALO
[ct=4347.535] BULLS, UNIVERSITY OF BUFFALO.
[ct=4352.171] SO, HE STAYED HOME.
[ct=4353.996] GETS THE TOUCHDOWN, EXTRA POINT
[ct=4353.996] IS GOOD.
[ct=4357.899] AND BUFFALO NOW WITH A THRE
[ct=4360.187] TOUCHDOWN ADVANTAGE.
[ct=4363.541] EVER BEEN ON THAT ONE?
[ct=4367.380] THE ONE IN SEATTLE IS VERY COOL.
[ct=4368.198] KIRK: I HAVE NOT.
[ct=4371.822] HOW ABOUT THAT?
[ct=4375.853] I DON'T MIX WELL WITH THE DEW
[ct=4376.441] POINT OVER 75.
[ct=4380.567] AL: IT'S WAY OVER 75.
[ct=4384.045] KIRK: IT'S JUST BEEN ONE OF
[ct=4385.720] THOSE NIGHTS FOR TUA IN THIS
[ct=4389.023] OFFENSE, -- TAKING AWAY HIS
[ct=4389.562] MAIN THREATS.
[ct=4390.900] HE IS TRYING TO FIND OTHER
[ct=4391.129] OPTIONS.
[ct=4394.199] DUBOSE NOT GETTING HIS HEAD
[ct=4395.678] TURNED AROUND, TIPPED BALL
[ct=4396.625] INTERCEPTION, NOT ON THE SAME
[ct=4399.785] BALL GOES OVER HIS HEAD,
[ct=4401.541] INTERCEPTION AND A COUPLE OF
[ct=4402.091] BACKUP OFFENSIVE LINEMAN IN THE
[ct=4403.794] GAME WITH KENDALL LAMM.
[ct=4407.915] YOU SEE LESTER COTTON AND HE
[ct=4409.807] LOOKS TO DARA BUBBLE AND SAYS,
[ct=4410.086] MAN, SHOULD HAVE THROWN IT AWAY.
[ct=4415.335] THERE IS TYREEK HILL SAYING,
[ct=4415.335] LET'S GO.
[ct=4417.541] LET'S GET THIS THING GOING.
[ct=4420.315] AL: HE WAS SHAKING HIS HEAD
[ct=4420.593] COMING OFF THE FIELD.
[ct=4421.375] HE CANNOT GET LOOSE.
[ct=4423.005] THEY HAVE TAKEN CARE OF HIM
[ct=4426.117] TUA'S ONLY THRONE FOR 109 YARDS
[ct=4430.355] -- THROWN FOR 109 YARDS.
[ct=4431.746] PASS CAUGHT BY HILL.
[ct=4433.172] HE GETS EIGHT.
[ct=4435.397] KAYLLE, WHAT YOU GOT?
[ct=4439.539] KAYLEE: THE DOLPHINS HAVE THEIR
[ct=4442.847] LEFT TACKLE BACK ON THE FIELD.
[ct=4445.774] HE CAME OUT BECAUSE OF THE LAST
[ct=4448.328] INTERCEPTION BECAUSE OF A
[ct=4448.328] SHOULDER ISSUE.
[ct=4450.086] HE IS GETTING HIS HARNESS
[ct=4450.364] READJUSTED.
[ct=4451.023] YOU CAN SEE IT.
[ct=4455.008] HE AND TUA HAD A CHAT BEFORE
[ct=4455.388] THEY HEADED BACK OUT THERE
[ct=4457.918] AL: THEY HAD LAMM IN AT THAT PO
[ct=4460.644] INT, THEY HAD ALREADY MADE THE
[ct=4462.731] CHANGE IT LEFT GUARD, 2ND AND 2,
[ct=4465.283] AND THE BILLS EXPLOITED IT.
[ct=4468.626] TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=4469.813] STUFFED.
[ct=4472.772] RIGHT AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=4477.052] PUTS THE WRAP ON JAYLEN WRIGHT.
[ct=4482.862] MCDERMOTT, WE CAN TALK SCHEMES
[ct=4487.435] AND XES AND OES ALL YOU WANT,
[ct=4487.435] THINGS OF THE VIEWERS AT HOME OR
[ct=4489.255] SING, YOU'RE SEEING A DEFENSE,
[ct=4490.169] THE BIG EMPHASIS AGAINST ALL OF
[ct=4491.481] THIS SPEED WAS KEEP THE BALL IN
[ct=4493.086] FRONT AND FLY TO THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=4497.322] PLAY SMART, PLAY FAST, PLAY
[ct=4497.980] PHYSICAL AND WE NEED TURNOVERS.
[ct=4502.756] THOSE WERE THE POINTS HE BROUGHT
[ct=4503.557] UP TO US THIS WEEK.
[ct=4504.518] EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE SEEN FROM
[ct=4504.962] BUFFALO'S DEFENSE.
[ct=4507.900] AL: 3RD AND 4.
[ct=4511.037] 8:00 TO GO IN THE THIRD QUARTER.
[ct=4513.510] PRESSURE.
[ct=4514.151] MILLER ALMOST GOT THERE BUT HE
[ct=4514.963] COMPLETES THE PASS.
[ct=4518.739] BIG GAIN INSIDE BILLS TERRITORY
[ct=4519.118] COULD 43 YARD LINE.
[ct=4523.234] HIS BEST GAIN OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=4525.645] FIRST DOWN, THE GAIN OF 21.
[ct=4528.926] KIRK: AND MILLER ALMOST COMES UP
[ct=4529.942] WITH ANOTHER SACK.
[ct=4531.357] HE HAD HIS FIRST SACK LAST WEEK.
[ct=4533.699] LOOK AT THAT SPOON MOVE -- THAT
[ct=4535.149] SPIN MOVE.
[ct=4538.200] LET'S GIVE TUA A LOT OF CREDIT.
[ct=4539.014] HE COULD NOT STEP INTO THIS
[ct=4539.562] THROW.
[ct=4540.076] FINALLY SEE THAT GLANCE ROUTE
[ct=4541.291] THAT WE ALWAYS THINK ABOUT WHEN
[ct=4542.276] IT COMES TO MIAMI'S OFFENSE.
[ct=4545.311] THEY STILL HIT TOO HIGH, BUT IS
[ct=4546.628] ABLE TO GET BETWEEN THE CORNER
[ct=4547.261] AND THE LINEBACKER AND THE
[ct=4547.655] SAFETY CLOSING IN.
[ct=4552.852] AL: FIRST DOWN AT THE 43.
[ct=4556.433] TUA OPEN, LEFT
[ct=4557.903] IN BOUNDS IS THE QUESTION.
[ct=4559.312] HILL IS THERE.
[ct=4561.769] IT IS NOT, SO HE'LL WAS ABLE TO
[ct=4564.174] TRUCK.
[ct=4566.830] KI-- THE CHALK.
[ct=4571.263] KIRK: THE LEFT FOOT LOOKED LIKE
[ct=4571.537] IT MIGHT'VE GOTTEN DOWN.
[ct=4572.818] I DO NOT THINK THE RIGHT FOOT
[ct=4573.097] WAS CLOSE AT ALL.
[ct=4574.427] THAT LEFT FOOT.
[ct=4576.060] LET'S SEE.
[ct=4579.051] WELL, THE LEFT FOOT ACTUALLY
[ct=4580.528] TOUCHES THE LINE.
[ct=4583.081] AL: MM-HMM, YEP.
[ct=4585.134] KIRK: BUT YOU LIKE THE ANSWER IF
[ct=4585.995] YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY THAT TOO
[ct=4589.564] HIGH LOOK, TRY TO SQUEEZE THE
[ct=4590.364] BALL ON THE SIDELINES BETWEEN
[ct=4591.134] THE CORNER AND THE SAFETY.
[ct=4597.177] AL: TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=4599.493] WITH SOME BLOCKING IN FRONT.
[ct=4600.185] NICE RUN.
[ct=4602.365] GOOD RUN.
[ct=4603.178] JAYLEN WRIGHT.
[ct=4607.676] ROOKIE FOURTH ROUND PICK OUT OF
[ct=4607.676] TENNESSEE.
[ct=4609.307] 3RD AND SHORT.
[ct=4615.505] KIRK: HOW ABOUT TYREEK HILL
[ct=4618.333] THIS TIME ON THE VETERAN VON
[ct=4618.333] MILLER TRYING TO HELP OUT, TO
[ct=4622.950] SET THE EDGE HERE AND WILLING TO
[ct=4623.523] COME DOWN AND TAKE ON THE BIG
[ct=4623.590] FELLA?
[ct=4627.169] NICE JOB, HELP THEM GET TO THE
[ct=4627.729] EDGE.
[ct=4627.975] I LIKE YOUR TONE.
[ct=4630.580] HEY, THAT IS A GOOD RUN.
[ct=4631.389] I THINK JAYLEN WRIGHT BRINGS
[ct=4635.317] SOME NATURAL ABILITY TO RUN THE
[ct=4637.113] FOOTBALL AND HAS NOT JUST
[ct=4637.998] QUICKNESS BUT SOME POWER.
[ct=4640.626] AL: HILL IN MOTION OUT OF THE
[ct=4641.378] BACKFIELD, FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4644.026] TO THE 20 YARD LINE.
[ct=4646.329] BEFORE HE IS TACKLE.
[ct=4651.874] CONVERTING ON A 3RD AND SHORT.
[ct=4657.026] KIRK: HE GETS A GOOD PUSH.
[ct=4658.887] 73 AUSTIN JACKSON DOES A GOOD
[ct=4660.170] JOB AND EVERYONE IS PINCHING AS
[ct=4661.997] AN OFFENSIVE LINE DOWN THE
[ct=4663.271] LOOK AT THAT QUICK CHANGE OF
[ct=4663.841] DIRECTION BY ACHANE.
[ct=4667.357] WE TALKED ABOUT JAYLEN WRIGHT
[ct=4669.212] HAVING SOME PHYSICALITY.
[ct=4670.481] YOU CAN SEE THAT ALSO, THE
[ct=4672.587] VERSATILITY OF ACHANE, A 4-3-2
[ct=4675.945] GUY BUT RUNNING THROUGH SOME OF
[ct=4676.205] THOSE ARM TACKLES.
[ct=4678.825] AL: MEANWHILE ARMISTEAD IS BACK
[ct=4679.464] ON THE BENCH.
[ct=4681.632] HE WAS OUT, AND LAMM IS IN
[ct=4683.579] TO THE END ZONE.
[ct=4689.004] A LITTLE TOO HIGH AND OFF THE
[ct=4689.869] FINGERTIPS AND HAMLIN WAS THERE
[ct=4692.603] BUT A HIT THE GROUND, INTENDED
[ct=4693.662] FOR JULIAN HILL.
[ct=4694.006] FIRST TIME THEY HAVE GONE AFTER
[ct=4694.820] HIM.
[ct=4695.373] HE WOULD BE THE NUMBER THREE
[ct=4696.279] TGITH
[ct=4699.336] TG-- TIGHT END.
[ct=4702.507] KIRK: THEY ATTACKED THE SIDELINE
[ct=4704.465] FOR, IF THEY PLAY TOO HIGH, WHAT
[ct=4704.887] IS THE OTHER ANSWER?
[ct=4708.549] DOWN THE MIDDLE,BALL GETS UP A
[ct=4710.677] LITTLE BIT AWAY FROM HIM.
[ct=4712.317] USUALLY IF SMITH WERE IN THERE,
[ct=4712.963] YOU WOULD EXPECT THEM TO HIT
[ct=4715.182] THAT SAME ROUTE.
[ct=4718.157] HILL WAS A HIGH SPOKE
[ct=4719.596] QUARTERBACK, PLAYED SLOT IN
[ct=4719.596] COLLEGE.
[ct=4720.603] THAT TIME NOT ABLE TO BRING IT
[ct=4726.420] AL: INSIDE 6:00 IN THE THIRD.
[ct=4730.124] TUA QUICK THROW, FIGHTING HIS
[ct=4730.692] WAY TO THE 12 YARD LINE IS
[ct=4732.327] SMITH.
[ct=4733.769] SENDING UP ANOTHER BIG THIRD
[ct=4735.272] DOWN HERE.
[ct=4740.062] 2-2 ON THIRD DOWN AND STARTED
[ct=4740.890] BACK AT THE 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=4743.247] KIRK: YOU LOOK AT THE CLOCK, YOU
[ct=4744.473] LOOK AT THE SCORE, I THINK MIKE
[ct=4746.085] MCDANIEL KNOWS THEY NEED A
[ct=4749.171] WE TALKED ABOUT THE GAME WILL
[ct=4750.929] COME DOWN FOR MIAMI, THEY MOVE
[ct=4750.929] THE BALL.
[ct=4751.727] WHAT WILL THEY DO IN THE RED
[ct=4752.179] ZONE?
[ct=4754.742] WILL THERE BE ABLE TO COME UP
[ct=4755.222] WITH TOUCHDOWNS OR NOT?
[ct=4758.767] 1-2 SO FAR TONIGHT IN THIS AREA.
[ct=4759.598] THEY NEED A TOUCHDOWN ON THIS
[ct=4759.598] DRIVE.
[ct=4763.510] AL: THEY WERE GREAT LAST YEAR,
[ct=4764.049] SECOND IN THE LEAGUE AND THE RED
[ct=4765.559] ZONE, THIRD DOWN, 3.
[ct=4766.762] THEY PLAY HERE FOR THEM.
[ct=4771.093] AND HE'S STUFFED.
[ct=4774.176] ACHANE -- ED OLIVER IS THERE.
[ct=4778.417] HAD THAT BIG BREAKUP ON FOURTH
[ct=4779.032] DOWN THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=4781.381] IT'S FOURTH AND 4 NOW.
[ct=4785.039] KIRK: REMEMBER THE LEFT SIDE
[ct=4785.504] WITH LESTER COTTON AND KENDALL
[ct=4787.715] LAMM, THESE ARE NEW GUYS.
[ct=4790.605] WE'VE SEEN ED OLIVER DOING IT TO
[ct=4791.467] THE STARTERS AND NOW YOU SEE HIM
[ct=4791.865] DOING IT TO THE BACKUPS.
[ct=4794.661] HE IS THE ENFORCER IN THE
[ct=4796.487] INTERIOR WITH THE LOW, THAT LOW
[ct=4797.791] CENTER OF GRAVITY, 6’
[ct=4799.468] CENTER OF GRAVITY, 6'1", 290,
[ct=4800.305] GREAT QUICKNESS.
[ct=4804.059] AL: GOT 20 MINUTES LEFT IN
[ct=4804.463] REGULATION.
[ct=4807.333] DOWN BY 21 POINT, FOURTH AND 4.
[ct=4810.668] TUA STEPS UP, HE IS GOING TO RUN
[ct=4811.239] FOR THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4813.694] AND TAKES A SHOT AT THE SIX YARD
[ct=4816.093] HAMLIN HIT HIM.
[ct=4817.556] AND TUA DOWN.
[ct=4819.075] MMM.
[ct=4823.484] PICKED UP THE FIRST, SPLIT THE
[ct=4824.654] SCENE BUT PAYS THE PRICE.
[ct=4831.736] THE BACKUP QUARTERBACK IS SKYLER
[ct=4831.736] THOMPSON.
[ct=4838.718] MEANWHILE, THEY LOOK AT TUA.
[ct=4843.171] DOLPHINS TAKING A KNEE AT THE
[ct=4845.622] MOMENT, BACK AT THE 15 YARD LINE
[ct=4847.264] AS THEY ATTEND TO HIM.
[ct=4847.264] HERE IT IS AGAIN.
[ct=4851.893] TAGOVAILOA IS UP AFTER
[ct=4851.893] TAKING THAT HIT.
[ct=4855.091] ASSISTED OFF THE FIELD WITH A
[ct=4855.385] SLIGHT LIMPED.
[ct=4859.584] -- A SLIGHT LIMP.
[ct=4861.887] KIRK: OF COURSE WE ALL REMEMBER
[ct=4862.630] A FEW YEARS AGO THAT WAS A BIG
[ct=4863.458] CONCERN IN HIS CAREER.
[ct=4869.081] A FEW YEARS AGO, HE BULKED UP TO
[ct=4869.641] TRY TO PROTECT HIMSELF.
[ct=4870.543] THIS YEAR HE'S ACTUALLY DOWN 14
[ct=4873.912] POUNDS, MUCH SLIMMER TO TRY TO
[ct=4874.355] BE ABLE TO MOVE AROUND.
[ct=4878.097] AL: YOU WATCHED HIM FOR YEARS,
[ct=4881.304] COLLEGE AND PRO AND SOMETIMES HE
[ct=4881.835] CAN RUN RECKLESSLY.
[ct=4884.693] KIRK: I FEEL LIKE HE’
[ct=4885.066] KIRK: I FEEL LIKE HE'S A LITTLE
[ct=4885.752] RECKLESS WHEN HE RUNS AND HE
[ct=4886.112] DOES NOT DO IT OFTEN.
[ct=4889.136] BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A
[ct=4890.271] SLIDE.
[ct=4891.101] YOU WOULD LOVE TO SEE HIM,
[ct=4891.585] ESPECIALLY WITH THE SAFETY
[ct=4894.800] COMING TOWARDS HIM, HE ALREADY
[ct=4896.086] HAD THE FIRST DOWN, JUST LIKE,
[ct=4899.519] FEET FIRST, GET DOWN AND PROTECT
[ct=4899.519] YOUR BODY.
[ct=4901.622] ON ONE HAND, YOU ADMIRE HIM, HIS
[ct=4902.022] DETERMINATION.
[ct=4906.712] ON THE OTHER HAND, HE'S SUCH AN
[ct=4906.985] IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT THIS TEAM
[ct=4908.806] IS ABOUT AND WHO THEY ARE.
[ct=4912.633] YOU LOVE TO HAVE SEEN THAT SLIDE
[ct=4912.633] TO GET DOWN.
[ct=4917.505] UP TO SEE HIM WALKING OFF THE
[ct=4919.940] AL: RIGHT BACK TO THE LOCKER
[ct=4920.338] ROOM.
[ct=4921.868] THAT WAS A FOURTH DOWN PLAY, SO
[ct=4922.945] HE KEEPS THE DRIVE ALIVE.
[ct=4925.685] SKYLAR THOMPSON WHO ACTUALLY
[ct=4926.457] PLAYED IN A PLAYOFF GAME BETWEEN
[ct=4929.400] THESE TWO TEAMS AND DIDN'T PLAY,
[ct=4933.147] I MEAN, HE WAS OK AND THAT GAME
[ct=4933.623] EVEN THOUGH THEY LOST.
[ct=4934.618] SEVENTH ROUND PICK.
[ct=4937.392] HE PLAYED IN THE WILD CARD GAME
[ct=4939.427] TWO YEARS AGO AGAINST THE BILLS.
[ct=4941.619] KIRK: CAN RUN THE BALL.
[ct=4944.371] AL: YES, HE CAN.
[ct=4945.720] THIS TIME HE GIVES IT TO ACHANE
[ct=4948.504] HE ACTUALLY STARTED TO STUMBLE.
[ct=4952.010] >> LET'S PUT THIS INTO CONTEXT.
[ct=4955.967] TUA DID NOT MISS A START LAST
[ct=4956.889] YEAR BUT DURING THE 2022 SEASON
[ct=4959.844] HE EXPERIENCED TWO CONCUSSIONS.
[ct=4962.100] HE WAS EVALUATED FOR A HEAD
[ct=4962.509] INJURY WE THREE BECAUSE THE
[ct=4963.600] BILLS BUT RETURNED TO THE GAME
[ct=4965.308] IN ONE GAME LATER HE EXHIBITED
[ct=4969.133] TEXTBOOK CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS AND
[ct=4971.102] WAS TAKEN OFF THE FIELD BY AN
[ct=4972.312] AMBULANCE PARE THE CONTROVERSY
[ct=4974.020] PROMPTED THE NFL TO CHANGES
[ct=4975.564] CONCUSSION POLICY AND IN WEEK 16
[ct=4979.795] THAT 20 SEASON.
[ct=4985.421] AL: WE REMEMBER THAT ONE WELL.
[ct=4985.662] STUFFED AGAIN.
[ct=4986.161] NOTHING HAPPENING THERE.
[ct=4989.850] ACHANE HIT AS HE TRIES TO
[ct=4992.568] CROSS LOVE LINE, -- THE LINE
[ct=4995.954] KIRK: WE ARE ALL THINKING ABOUT
[ct=4999.136] TUA AND HOPE FOR THE BEST THERE
[ct=5000.011] WERE ESPECIALLY WITH THE HISTORY
[ct=5004.668] THAT HE HAD THAT KAYLEE JUST
[ct=5005.332] TALKED ABOUT BUT WITH SKYLAR
[ct=5007.074] THOMPSON AND MIKE MCDANIEL NOW,
[ct=5008.261] THEY NEED A TOUCHDOWN THIS
[ct=5012.520] 3:00 MINUTES TO GO IN THE THIRD
[ct=5015.264] VERY DIFFERENT NOW.
[ct=5017.533] BUFFALO DOES NOT FEAR, UNTIL
[ct=5018.351] THOMPSON MAKES THEM PAY FOR IT.
[ct=5019.753] THEY ARE NOT FEARING THE THREAT
[ct=5020.488] OF THE THROW.
[ct=5022.249] SEE IF HE CAN GET THE BALL TO
[ct=5026.073] AL: THOMPSON WITH THE SEVENTH
[ct=5027.243] ROUND PIC TWO YEARS AGO.
[ct=5028.506] HANGS IN THE POCKET.
[ct=5028.955] FLOATS ONE INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=5030.112] NOT EVEN CLOSE.
[ct=5033.640] BERRIOS WAS CLOSEST.
[ct=5035.875] 4TH AND GOAL.
[ct=5040.986] KIRK: BERRIOS LOST HIS FITTING,
[ct=5040.986] MIDFIELD.
[ct=5042.513] WE DID HAVE SOME RAIN EARLY THIS
[ct=5042.513] AFTERNOON.
[ct=5044.528] I DO NOT KNOW HOW SLICK THAT
[ct=5045.993] FIELD IS BUT HE LOST HIS FOOTING
[ct=5046.850] AND THAT BALL NEVER HAD A CHANCE
[ct=5048.717] BUT THIS IS FOUR DOWN TERRITORY,
[ct=5052.576] 2:43 IN THE THIRD, THEY NEED A
[ct=5052.576] TOUCHDOWN HERE.
[ct=5057.702] AL: THOMPSON STARTED THAT GAME
[ct=5058.729] IN THE PLAYOFFS TWO YEARS AGO
[ct=5062.570] BECAUSE TUA WAS HURT AND TEDDY
[ct=5065.442] BRIDGEWATER WAS ALSO HER.
[ct=5073.246] THREE RECEIVER SET TO THE LEFT
[ct=5073.614] AND ALL KINDS OF MOVEMENT UP
[ct=5073.614] FRONT.
[ct=5079.728] >> SECOND CHARGE, TIMEOUT MIAMI.
[ct=5082.814] AL: MIAMI HAD TO TAKE AN EARLY
[ct=5083.980] NOW THEY ARE DOWN TO JUST ONE.
[ct=5087.952] 2:39 REMAINING IN THE THIRD.
[ct=5089.334] KIRK: AND SKYLAR THOMPSON IN HIS
[ct=5092.698] THIRD YEAR OUT OF KANSAS STATE,
[ct=5093.620] YOU CAN SEE THE EXPERIENCE HE
[ct=5095.222] HAD GOING BACK TO THE TWO YEARS
[ct=5097.908] AGO, WHEN HE WAS IN THE WILD
[ct=5098.505] CARD GAME BECAUSE OF THE INJURY
[ct=5099.133] TO TUA.
[ct=5102.606] SO, HE DOES HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE
[ct=5103.626] IN SOME BIG GAMES.
[ct=5104.871] LIKE I SAID, HE CAN CREATE IF HE
[ct=5105.855] GETS PRESCIENT, HE'S THE
[ct=5108.664] ATHLETIC ABILITY TO PULL AWAY
[ct=5108.949] FROM PRESSURE.
[ct=5112.085] THE QUESTION IS, CAN THEY GET
[ct=5112.822] SEPARATION?
[ct=5115.563] THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE KNOWN FOR,
[ct=5116.391] IS THEIR ABILITY TO SEPARATE
[ct=5119.264] FROM TIGHT COVERAGE WHETHER IT
[ct=5119.888] IS WADDLED OR TYREEK HILL.
[ct=5122.863] BILLS TRYING TO TAKE THOSE AWAY.
[ct=5124.482] MAKES YOU WONDER IF SMITH, THE T
[ct=5128.424] IGHT END THAT CAME OVER THIS
[ct=5131.280] YEAR, IF THEY CAN GET HIM IT
[ct=5133.366] WITH HIS SIZE, 6'3", 250, TRY TO
[ct=5133.766] GIVE HIM THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=5136.860] AL: MIAMI PLAYING WITH THE NEW
[ct=5137.386] QUARTERBACK AND A NEW LEFT
[ct=5140.582] TACKLE AND A NEW LEFT GUARD.
[ct=5140.835] YOU THINK YOU GOT PROBLEMS?
[ct=5143.926] SO DO WE.
[ct=5146.661] THOMPSON, HE SLIPS AND DOWN HE
[ct=5146.661] GOES.
[ct=5150.416] 15 YARD LINE AND VON MILLER,
[ct=5152.158] AFTER THAT 14 GAME DROUGHT IN
[ct=5156.659] HIS 14TH YEAR, AT THE AGE OF
[ct=5159.423] 35, NOW HAS SACKS IN BACK TO
[ct=5161.503] BACK GAMES WITH 2:40 TO GO IN
[ct=5161.753] THE THIRD.
[ct=5163.518] 31-10, BILLS.
[ct=5167.122] LOOK NOW AT TONIGHT'S
[ct=5171.014] JOURNEY AS PRESENTED BY CONDÉ.
[ct=5176.519] FIRST HALF, 82 TOTAL YARDS, TWO
[ct=5177.807] TOUCHDOWNS, ONE ON THE GROUND
[ct=5178.223] AND ONE IN THE AIR.
[ct=5183.525] BILLS DEFENSE, 17 POINTS OFF
[ct=5184.928] THREE TURNOVERS AND ON TOP OF
[ct=5188.557] ALL OF THAT THERE GOES TUA BACK
[ct=5191.404] TO THE LOCKER ROOM OFF THE LAST
[ct=5191.404] SERIES.
[ct=5192.896] THEY TURNED IT OVER ON DOWNS.
[ct=5197.380] A LONG NIGHT FOR MIKE MCDANIEL
[ct=5200.350] AT THIS POINT DOWN BY 21.
[ct=5201.598] IN THE BILLS HAVE THE BALL.
[ct=5204.765] -- AND THE BILLS HAVE THE BALL
[ct=5208.702] FROM THE 15 YARD LINE.
[ct=5209.741] THEY ARE STARTING TO USE SOME OF
[ct=5210.268] THE CLOCK.
[ct=5213.486] THE GOOD RUN GAME CONTINUES.
[ct=5216.059] KIRK: LET'S GO BACK AND LOOK AT
[ct=5216.650] THE SACK.
[ct=5222.161] VON MILLER SAID NOW I GO WITH
[ct=5223.679] GET OFF.
[ct=5227.102] I DON'T WANT TO WRESTLE AT 35
[ct=5228.027] YEARS OLD WITH THESE BIG GUYS
[ct=5229.251] BUT THAT TIME IT WAS JUST SPEED
[ct=5231.818] AROUND THE EDGE OF THE RIGHT
[ct=5235.076] TACKLE, AUSTIN JACKSON, ON THE
[ct=5237.108] FOURTH DOWN PLAY.
[ct=5239.910] GREAT TO SEE HIM WITHOUT MOTOR
[ct=5239.910] AND INTENSITY.
[ct=5240.857] ONE OF THE GREAT GUYS IN THE
[ct=5242.186] LEAGUE FOR A LONG TIME.
[ct=5246.139] AL: WON THE SUPER BOWL M.V.P.
[ct=5249.050] AWARD WITH DENVER AND WON
[ct=5250.176] ANOTHER RING WITH THE RAMS TWO
[ct=5255.202] CONCLUDING HIS CAREER POSSIBLY
[ct=5255.607] AT BUFFALO.
[ct=5259.249] WE SPOKE WITH MILLER YESTERDAY.
[ct=5260.900] LOOKING UP SOME OF THE THINGS
[ct=5261.885] ABOUT HIS LIFE AND I SAID, WAIT
[ct=5265.790] A MINUTE, YOU MAJORED IN POULTRY
[ct=5267.385] SCIENCE AT TEXAS A&M.
[ct=5268.251] WHAT GOT YOU INTO POULTRY
[ct=5268.710] SCIENCE?
[ct=5273.077] HE SAID, I NEEDED TO GET MY GPA
[ct=5275.257] UP AND I LOOKED AT THAT CLASS
[ct=5276.302] AND THE AVERAGE GRADE WAS A
[ct=5276.559] MINUS.
[ct=5278.464] AND HE GOT TO LIKE IT A LOT.
[ct=5282.646] KIRK: YOU SURE DID.
[ct=5283.982] I THINK IT HAS BECOME A THING
[ct=5286.090] FOR HIM TO THIS DAY.
[ct=5286.517] HE LOVES IT.
[ct=5289.676] BREAKING DOWN DIFFERENT CHICKEN
[ct=5295.427] AL: KENTUCKY FRIED, POPEYES,
[ct=5296.954] CHIK-FILA.
[ct=5299.928] A GAIN OF ONE.
[ct=5303.101] KAYLEE: THE DOLPHINS TELL US TUA
[ct=5306.582] TAGOVAILOA WILL NOT RETURN TO
[ct=5307.021] THE GAME.
[ct=5308.201] HE HAS BEEN RULED OUT WITH A
[ct=5308.648] CONCUSSION.
[ct=5312.861] THEY DETERMINED THAT SIX MINUTES
[ct=5313.120] AFTER HE LEFT THE FIELD AND WENT
[ct=5314.025] TO THE LOCKER ROOM.
[ct=5317.354] AL: A LITTLE IRONY THERE THAT HE
[ct=5321.380] WAS HIT BY DAMAR HAMLIN, AND YOU
[ct=5321.651] KNOW THAT HISTORY.
[ct=5325.388] IT WAS LEGAL.
[ct=5327.047] IT WAS UNFORTUNATE.
[ct=5328.126] THE ONLY GOOD THING FOR THE
[ct=5329.462] DOLPHINS IS YOU GET A MINUTE BY
[ct=5332.899] WEEK SO THEY DON'T HAVE A NAME
[ct=5333.223] FOR 10 DAYS.
[ct=5338.741] GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO PASS THE
[ct=5338.741] PROTOCOL.
[ct=5340.309] SECOND DOWN AND 9.
[ct=5343.750] BREAKING A TACKLE, FIGHTING HIS
[ct=5349.614] WAY AND GETTING THE YARDAGE IS
[ct=5350.109] DALTON KINCAID.
[ct=5351.782] THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE END OF
[ct=5351.984] THE THIRD QUARTER.
[ct=5355.808] KIRK: I THINK WE ARE GETTING A
[ct=5356.150] REAL FEEL FOR WHO BUFFALO WILL
[ct=5358.527] BE THIS YEAR.
[ct=5360.468] PLAYING WITH GREAT INTENSITY ON
[ct=5363.810] JOSH ALLEN IS NOT FORCING THE
[ct=5364.136] BALL.
[ct=5370.702] DIGGS IS 12 OF 17.
[ct=5372.848] THEY ARE I'M GOING TO COLUMBIA,
[ct=5373.347] SOUTH CAROLINA.
[ct=5377.971] AL: NEITHER IS THE OWNER OF THE
[ct=5379.283] TEAM AND THE GENERAL MANAGER.
[ct=5382.334] MEANWHILE, NICE LITTLE RUN FOR
[ct=5385.893] THE PEGULA FAMILY.
[ct=5387.838] THERE IS TERRY.
[ct=5391.576] HIS DAUGHTER WAS SENSATIONAL IN
[ct=5392.226] THE U.S. OPEN GETTING TO THE
[ct=5392.535] FINAL.
[ct=5395.732] A TREMENDOUS RUN FOR HER,
[ct=5396.083] JESSICA.
[ct=5399.469] PRETTY GOOD.
[ct=5402.257] HE HAS THE BILLS ON THEIR WAY TO
[ct=5402.750] BEING 2-0.
[ct=5404.184] TO HIS DAUGHTER GOES TO THE
[ct=5404.983] FINALS OF THE U.S. OPEN.
[ct=5408.058] AND HE HAS
[ct=5409.653] THE NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE.
[ct=5413.111] KIRK: A PRETTY GOOD RUN HE
[ct=5415.350] HE HAS TO BE PLEASED.
[ct=5416.883] THERE WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS
[ct=5418.541] FOOTBALL TEAM WITH
[ct=5419.809] FACES.
[ct=5423.031] HERE THEY ARE UP 21 ON THE ROAD
[ct=5424.654] IN WEEK NUMBER TWO AGAINST A
[ct=5425.322] DIVISIONAL OPPONENT.
[ct=5429.260] AL: SAM MARTIN SENDS IT SKYWARD.
[ct=5431.756] THEY LET IT BOUNCE.
[ct=5434.487] IT GOES INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=5437.526] EARLY FOURTH QUARTER.
[ct=5440.446] BACK IN 30 SECONDS.
[ct=5480.867] AL: THE DOLPHINS HAVE IT DOWN
[ct=5483.325] ALREADY 1-10.
[ct=5485.244] SKYLAR THOMPSON IN FOR THE REST
[ct=5485.670] OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=5488.665] HE WAS INACTIVE IN EVERY GAME
[ct=5490.060] LAST SEASON.
[ct=5490.499] HE PLAYED IN THE WILDCARD GAME
[ct=5494.494] IN 2022 AND HASN'T PLAYED SINCE.
[ct=5498.313] HE GOT SACKED ON THE FOURTH DOWN
[ct=5501.641] PLAY THE LAST TIME THEY HAD THE
[ct=5506.418] HE STARTS FROM THE 20 YARD LINE.
[ct=5506.418] DOWN FIELD.
[ct=5508.527] OFF TO THE SIDE.
[ct=5511.854] A MINIMUM GAIN.
[ct=5518.610] KIRK: THEY CALLED THAT PLAY
[ct=5520.880] EARLIER IN THE RED ZONE AND
[ct=5521.849] SCORED A TOUCHDOWN BUT THIS TIME
[ct=5523.832] BUFFALO IS IN A BETTER POSITION
[ct=5524.624] TO DEFEND THAT.
[ct=5527.322] REMEMBER, MY
[ct=5532.922] REMEMBER, MIAMI IS NOT ONLY
[ct=5532.922] PLAYING WITH A BACKUP
[ct=5535.268] QUARTERBACK BUT ALSO A BACKUP
[ct=5536.321] GUARD AND TACKLE.
[ct=5539.973] DOWN BY 20 ONE IN OBVIOUS
[ct=5540.459] PASSING SITUATIONS.
[ct=5547.738] AL: HE HAS NOT PLAYED SINCE 2022
[ct=5549.337] AT THE HELM.
[ct=5551.308] CAUGHT.
[ct=5559.849] A BUSY NIGHT FOR ETIENNE.
[ct=5564.567] HE HAS CARRIED THE BALL 21 TIMES
[ct=5564.995] AND CAUGHT FIVE.
[ct=5568.458] JOSH ALLEN CAN SMILE.
[ct=5572.346] A GOOD ENOUGH NIGHT FOR HIM.
[ct=5575.579] THE NUMBERS WON'T LINE HIM UP
[ct=5576.473] BUT THE DEFENSE HAS BEEN
[ct=5576.897] SENSATIONAL.
[ct=5578.585] AL: ABOUT TWO
[ct=5586.071] AL: ABOUT TTO GO 12-1 AGAINST
[ct=5586.396] THIS TEAM AND HIS CAREER.
[ct=5589.929] JOSH IN HIS SEVENTH YEAR AND
[ct=5590.398] SHOULD BE IN THE PRIME OF HIS
[ct=5590.624] CAREER.
[ct=5595.206] THOMPSON, HANGS IN THE POCKET.
[ct=5596.649] THROWS.
[ct=5599.157] GOOD COVERAGE.
[ct=5605.269] ALAN, -- ALLEN WE TALKED TO HIM
[ct=5606.988] LAST NIGHT.
[ct=5608.332] HE GREW UP IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY
[ct=5611.384] OF CALIFORNIA IN A TOWN WITH A
[ct=5613.036] THOUSAND PEOPLE AND KNOWN AS THE
[ct=5615.861] CANTALOUPE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD.
[ct=5617.649] HE HAS NEVER BEEN THE GRAND
[ct=5617.649] MARSHALL.
[ct=5623.846] KIRK: WE WERE ASKING HIM ABOUT
[ct=5625.170] GETTING UP AT 4:00 IN THE
[ct=5626.021] MORNING AS THE SON OF A FARMER.
[ct=5629.816] HIS DAD SAID THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE
[ct=5630.551] NOT GETTING UP EARLY TO HELP ME
[ct=5632.342] OUT IS IF YOU ARE PLAYING
[ct=5632.768] SPORTS.
[ct=5636.782] SO HE SAID, ME AND MY BROTHER
[ct=5637.055] PLAYED EVERY SPORT WE COULD
[ct=5637.576] FIND.
[ct=5639.895] AL: CAUGHT AT THE 40.
[ct=5648.039] KIRK: HE SAID HE HAS GRADUATED
[ct=5649.434] FROM CONTRIBUTING AND HELPING
[ct=5649.704] OUT.
[ct=5655.523] AL: HE OWNS THE FARM.
[ct=5657.200] THIRD AND 4.
[ct=5665.803] THAT WAS TOO HIGH AND INCOMPLETE
[ct=5667.545] GOOD WHAT CAN I TELL YOU -- IF
[ct=5670.975] WE ARE SHOWING THE FARM, YOU
[ct=5671.229] KNOW WHAT IT IS.
[ct=5674.440] 31-10 BALLGAME.
[ct=5677.417] KIRK: LET'S GO BACK TO VON
[ct=5682.037] HIS PRESENCE THERE -- SOMETIMES
[ct=5684.296] IT IS NOT ABOUT THE STOCK BUT
[ct=5686.521] MAY MAKING THE QUARTERBACK FEEL
[ct=5686.952] YOU.
[ct=5689.058] HE SAW HIM GET OFF QUICKLY AND
[ct=5690.765] HE HAD TO GET THE BALL OFF
[ct=5691.208] HURRY.
[ct=5693.700] I THINK HE AFFECTED THE
[ct=5696.285] QUARTERBACK AND THE ACCURACY OF
[ct=5696.285] THE THROW.
[ct=5704.322] AL: FOURTH AND 4.
[ct=5707.139] THEY HAVE TO GO FOR IT AND WE
[ct=5708.845] HAVE A WHISTLE HERE.
[ct=5720.980] AL: EI ESPECIALLY IN MIAMI.
[ct=5726.381] AL: FOURTH AND 9 BUT THEY WILL
[ct=5726.381] STILL GO FOR IT.
[ct=5737.518] A DEEP, DEEP DROP.
[ct=5741.703] EVERYBODY COVERED.
[ct=5742.961] RUNNING AROUND.
[ct=5743.880] GOING FOR THE FIRST DOWN BUT
[ct=5744.451] WILL NOT GET THERE.
[ct=5748.351] AND HE IS TACKLED BY
[ct=5750.625] ROUSSEAU WHO COMES OFF A THREE
[ct=5751.086] SACK GAME LAST WEEK.
[ct=5755.210] KIRK: NOT ONLY ARE THEY KEEPING
[ct=5756.876] THE SAFETIES BACK, THEY ARE
[ct=5760.102] PLAYING MAN COVERAGE UNDERNEATH
[ct=5760.660] THAT ALLOWING THEM TO DISRUPT
[ct=5761.150] THE TIMING.
[ct=5764.459] IT HAS BEEN A GREAT NIGHT FOR
[ct=5765.446] BUFFALO IN EVERY PHASE OF THE
[ct=5768.712] GAME HERE IN MIAMI, WEEK POWERED
[ct=5771.924] JAMES COOK HAS DONE WHAT HE HAS
[ct=5772.638] NEEDED AVERAGING SEVEN YARDS PER
[ct=5774.147] CARRY.
[ct=5779.416] YOU CAN SEE 39 YARDS FROM WHAT
[ct=5780.009] THEY EXPECTED OF HIM.
[ct=5784.443] TACKLES AND HIS ABILITY TO SHAKE
[ct=5786.247] THESE MIAMI DEFENDERS.
[ct=5787.903] A HOMECOMING OF SORTS
[ct=5789.178] COOK.
[ct=5791.019] HE GREW UP IN THIS AREA.
[ct=5793.548] HE WENT TO GEORGIA FOR COLLEGE.
[ct=5796.965] HIS OLDER BROTHER AND MOM ARE
[ct=5797.437] WATCHING SO A BIG NIGHT FOR
[ct=5797.932] JAMES COOK AND HIS BILLS TEAM.
[ct=5802.568] AL: THEY BUILT THE BIG LEAD THE
[ct=5804.884] THIRD TIME BUFFALO HAS STARTED A
[ct=5806.476] DRIVE AFTER STOPPING MIAMI ON
[ct=5811.202] AND TRYING TO USE THE CLOCK HERE
[ct=5812.952] MOVING FORWARD, A GAIN OF ABOUT
[ct=5815.199] 4 YARDS.
[ct=5818.948] KAYLEE: AFTER SEEING A DOLPHIN
[ct=5821.118] LEFT TACKLE IN AND OUT OF THE
[ct=5824.558] GAME, HE IS NOW IN THE DOLPHINS
[ct=5826.544] LOCKER ROOM HEADING INTO THE
[ct=5826.544] X-RAY ROOM.
[ct=5827.055] BEFORE HE DID HE GAVE TUA
[ct=5832.007] TAGOVAILOA'S BROTHER A HUG AS HE
[ct=5833.827] SITS OUTSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM
[ct=5834.985] WAITING FOR THE QUARTERBACK TO
[ct=5834.985] EMERGE.
[ct=5839.990] EVERYTHING IS GOING WRONG FOR
[ct=5842.866] MIAMI ON A NIGHT WHERE THEY WERE
[ct=5843.525] FAVORED BY A COUPLE OF POINTS.
[ct=5847.955] BUT IT HAS BEEN ALL BUFFALO.
[ct=5848.508] AND IT ALL HAS TO DO WITH THE
[ct=5850.802] DEFENSE, CLEARLY.
[ct=5858.167] A 32ND TIMEOUT.
[ct=5861.865] KIRK: THE BILLS HAVE HAD THEIR
[ct=5862.834] WAY AND HAVE NOT HAD TO RELY ON
[ct=5867.063] THIS NEW ROOM OF WIDE RECEIVERS
[ct=5868.624] WITH DAVIS NO LONGER HERE AND
[ct=5870.690] STEFON DIGGS NO LONGER HERE.
[ct=5874.148] AT SOME POINT THEY ARE GOING TO
[ct=5876.579] GO INTO A GAME AND JOSH ALLEN IS
[ct=5877.202] GOING TO HAVE TO RELY ON THIS
[ct=5879.558] GROUP.
[ct=5882.378] YOU SEE SHAKIRA WITH 39
[ct=5882.839] RECEPTIONS BUT EVERYONE ELSE IS
[ct=5882.839] GONE.
[ct=5884.733] IT IS A NEW GROUP.
[ct=5889.291] SHAKIR COMES BACK.
[ct=5893.522] MACK HOLLINS SETTING THE TONE IN
[ct=5894.247] THE ROOM.
[ct=5897.568] CURTIS SAMUEL CAN DO A LOT OF
[ct=5897.568] DIFFERENT THINGS.
[ct=5901.039] MARQUEZ VALDES-SCANTLING HAS
[ct=5901.604] PLAYED SO MANY BIG GAMES.
[ct=5905.016] KIND OF EXCITED TO SEE WHAT THEY
[ct=5907.893] CAN BECOME ALONG WITH THE TWO
[ct=5908.348] TIGHT ENDS.
[ct=5912.742] AL: THEY HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE
[ct=5914.669] TO SHOW THEIR STUFF YET.
[ct=5916.663] THEY PICKED COLEMAN IN THE
[ct=5918.298] SECOND ROUND.
[ct=5923.371] THEY TRADE IT DOWN WITH KANSAS
[ct=5924.178] CITY TO LET KANSAS CITY PICK IN
[ct=5924.731] FRONT OF THEM.
[ct=5928.360] A LOT OF GOOD RECEIVERS AND
[ct=5928.770] KANSAS CITY WENT FOR ONE OF THEM
[ct=5931.007] AS ONE.
[ct=5932.106] A PRETTY GOOD OPENING NIGHT FOR
[ct=5932.551] THEM AS WELL.
[ct=5936.525] KIRK: I THOUGHT MIAMI OF ALL
[ct=5937.116] TEAMS WHEN YOU GO BACK TO THAT
[ct=5940.952] DRAFT -- WOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN
[ct=5941.676] INTERESTING IF XANDER WERE
[ct=5947.224] ORTHY HAD GONE.
[ct=5952.252] AL: THEY WENT FOR THE BIG 6'4"
[ct=5952.719] ROOKIE OUT OF FLORIDA STATE.
[ct=5958.445] SHAKIR, THE ONLY GUY WHO CAUGHT
[ct=5963.068] A PASS FROM ALLEN COMING INTO
[ct=5966.104] THE SEASON AS WE TICK DOWN TO 10
[ct=5966.376] MINUTES.
[ct=5970.210] KIRK: THEY BROUGHT IN BROOKS AND
[ct=5971.624] DAVID LONG.
[ct=5974.441] THE FIRST TIME JOSH ALLEN HAS
[ct=5974.873] FELT ANY PRESSURE.
[ct=5980.717] HE DID A GOOD SENSE OF -- HE HAD
[ct=5982.201] THE GOOD SENSE TO FALL BACK AND
[ct=5982.431] FIND THE OPEN RECEIVER.
[ct=5987.039] THESE GUYS ARE PIECES THAT FIT
[ct=5987.039] TOGETHER LIKE A JIGSAW PUZZLE.
[ct=5991.710] I THINK SHAKIR WILL HAVE A YEAR
[ct=5993.454] WITH JOSH ALLEN THIS YEAR.
[ct=5999.735] AL: RAY DAVIS.
[ct=6003.815] YOU THINK ABOUT THE MOVE THEY
[ct=6003.815] MADE IN THE OFF-SEASON.
[ct=6006.216] IT IS NOT OFTEN YOU TRADE AWAY
[ct=6009.983] SOMEONE OF HIS CALIBER.
[ct=6012.442] YOU LOOK AT THAT PERIOD, MOST
[ct=6016.395] COMPLETIONS IN THE LEAGUE, MOST
[ct=6016.395] RECEIVING YARDS AND TIED FOR THE
[ct=6017.931] MOST TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=6021.324] THEY SENT HIM TO HOUSTON.
[ct=6025.698] AND DAVIS, AS YOU SEE THE GM,
[ct=6026.909] THE ARCHITECT OF THE DEALS,
[ct=6030.950] DAVIS LEAVES TOWN AND THE FANS
[ct=6031.312] ARE THINKING -- WHAT ARE WE
[ct=6031.852] DOING HERE?
[ct=6034.897] KIRK: LOOK AT WHERE THEY HAVE
[ct=6036.643] BEEN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IN
[ct=6038.053] THE PLAYOFFS, THEY NEEDED TO
[ct=6039.133] SHAKE THINGS UP.
[ct=6042.900] I THINK THE IDEA AROUND THIS IS
[ct=6043.662] WHEN YOU LET GO OF A SUPERSTAR
[ct=6045.744] LIKE THAT, THERE IS A TENDENCY
[ct=6049.590] TO ALWAYS FIND WAYS TO GIVE THAT
[ct=6051.151] SUPERSTAR THE BALL.
[ct=6053.298] WHEN YOU LOSE THAT ELEMENT, NOW
[ct=6053.646] YOU HAVE JOE BRADY AS THE
[ct=6056.426] OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR WHO CAN
[ct=6058.009] SAY, WE ARE NOT GOING TO RELY ON
[ct=6059.647] ONE GUY.
[ct=6061.368] WE ARE GOING TO READ THE
[ct=6061.615] COVERAGE AND LET THE DEFENSE
[ct=6064.393] DICTATE WHERE THE BALL GOES.
[ct=6068.256] ONE GAME YOU MIGHT HAVE ONE
[ct=6069.147] CATCH AND ANOTHER GAME YOU HAVE
[ct=6070.206] 10.
[ct=6073.245] IT IS HOW THE DEFENSE PLAYS WILL
[ct=6075.561] DICTATE THE READ FOR JOSH ALLEN.
[ct=6079.901] AND THEN THEY BECOME MORE
[ct=6080.356] RELIANT ON THE TIGHT ENDS.
[ct=6084.508] AL: TALKING TO 10 DIFFERENT
[ct=6085.803] GUYS, IT REMINDS ME AS WE HAVE A
[ct=6088.419] TIMEOUT CALLED BY BUFFALO BEFORE
[ct=6090.538] THE DELAY.
[ct=6093.751] YOU TRADE AWAY A MEGASTAR.
[ct=6095.152] IT IS WHAT KANSAS CITY DID WHEN
[ct=6098.399] THEY GOT RID OF TYREEK HILL.
[ct=6104.023] YOU HAVE MAHOMES COMING INTO HIS
[ct=6104.023] PRIME.
[ct=6105.560] YOU HAVE THE FASTEST GUY IN THE
[ct=6108.216] IT WORKED OUT PRETTY WELL FOR
[ct=6108.216] KANSAS CITY.
[ct=6112.317] KIRK: AND I THINK IT FREES UP
[ct=6112.711] THIS OFFENSE.
[ct=6117.703] STEFON DIGGS IS A GENERATIONAL
[ct=6119.746] TALENT, A SUPERSTAR AND I'M SURE
[ct=6120.267] HE WILL DO GREAT THINGS IN
[ct=6122.726] HOUSTON BUT IT IS ABOUT TRYING
[ct=6123.958] TO SEE WHERE THEY WILL GO AS A
[ct=6128.617] I THINK THE POTENTIAL -- I THINK
[ct=6130.216] YOU WILL SEE THEM RELY MORE ON
[ct=6130.877] THE RUNNING GAME.
[ct=6132.058] HOW ABOUT THE JOB BY THE
[ct=6136.363] OFFENSIVE LINE ON THE ROAD.
[ct=6138.135] THEY TOOK PRESSURE OFF JOSH
[ct=6138.469] ALLEN AND THE RECEIVERS.
[ct=6142.936] THEY WON THE TURNOVER GAME.
[ct=6144.655] I THINK IT IS A SEAN MCDERMOTT
[ct=6145.053] KIND OF TEAM.
[ct=6149.134] JOSH ALLEN NOT FEELING LIKE HE
[ct=6150.406] HAS TO BE THE HERO.
[ct=6153.549] THERE WILL BE THOSE MOMENTS BUT
[ct=6154.197] NOT EVERY WEEK.
[ct=6156.434] AL: THIRD AND 11.
[ct=6162.712] ALLEN IS ABLE TO THROW.
[ct=6167.068] THE PASS INTENDED FOR COLEMAN.
[ct=6171.600] THE ROOKIE NUMBER ONE PICK --
[ct=6173.078] THAT IS FOURTH AND 11.
[ct=6176.158] KIRK: JOSH ALLEN IS FORTUNATE
[ct=6179.983] HE ALWAYS SEEMS TO RUN TO HIS
[ct=6181.467] RIGHT AND GETS RID OF THE BALL
[ct=6181.829] RIGHT BEFORE HE GETS TO THE
[ct=6182.889] SIDELINE.
[ct=6186.264] UP AND OVER.
[ct=6188.070] THE ATHLETIC ABILITY TO GET UP
[ct=6189.567] AND OVER THE BENCH.
[ct=6191.405] THE BIG FELLA CAN CLIMB THE
[ct=6193.904] LADDER.
[ct=6198.411] AL: TYLER BASS --
[ct=6202.754] NO GOOD.
[ct=6208.624] THE NEXGEN STATS POWERED
[ct=6208.624] BY AWS.
[ct=6212.898] FOUR PRESSURES, 2.1 AVERAGE TIME
[ct=6215.945] TO PRESSURE, FASTEST GOING BACK
[ct=6219.165] TO 2021 BEFORE THE ACL.
[ct=6220.723] HE TRIED TO PLAY LAST YEAR.
[ct=6223.848] NOT THE SAME SINCE THAT INJURY
[ct=6224.127] BUT NOW HE LOOKS LIKE HIS OLD
[ct=6224.127] SELF.
[ct=6228.863] REFEREE: FALSE START.
[ct=6232.340] KIRK: THIS IS GOING TO BE A GAME
[ct=6236.996] ON SO MANY LEVELS THAT MIAMI IS
[ct=6237.410] GOING TO WANT TO PUT BEHIND THEM
[ct=6237.847] AND MOVE ON.
[ct=6239.161] OBVIOUSLY, WE THINK ABOUT TUA
[ct=6243.848] AND HIS HEALTH AND WHERE THEY
[ct=6244.975] WILL GO FROM HERE.
[ct=6245.731] FARMSTEAD IS OUTCOME OF THE LEFT
[ct=6249.432] TACKLE, WITH AN INJURY.
[ct=6250.183] YOU HAVE A BACKUP LEFT TACKLE,
[ct=6251.303] BACKUP QUARTERBACK.
[ct=6256.501] AL: AND EIGHT PENALTIES AGAINST
[ct=6257.375] THE DOLPHINS TONIGHT AND ONLY
[ct=6258.210] ONE AGAINST BUFFALO.
[ct=6262.240] KIRK: THE STORY TONIGHT BESIDES
[ct=6264.342] THE INJURIES IS OTHER TEAMS IN
[ct=6267.430] THE DIVISION ARE SEEING WHAT
[ct=6269.946] JACKSONVILLE DID LAST WEEK, THEY
[ct=6271.013] ARE SEEING WHAT BUFFALO DID
[ct=6273.262] TONIGHT AND THEY ARE SAYING, OK,
[ct=6274.399] HERE IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO
[ct=6276.436] WHEN WE GO AGAINST THIS MIAMI
[ct=6279.316] WE ARE GOING TO KEEP EVERYBODY
[ct=6280.724] IN FRONT.
[ct=6281.557] WE ARE GOING TO PLAY MAN UNDER
[ct=6285.628] WITH TWO SAFETIES DEEP.
[ct=6287.121] MAKE THEM FIND SOMEBODY ELSE
[ct=6290.259] OTHER THAN HILL AND W
[ct=6291.048] MAKE THEM RUN THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=6298.614] AL: TOOS TO THE OUT -- TOSS TO
[ct=6300.564] THE OUTSIDE AND OUT OF
[ct=6301.749] GOES JAYLEN WRIGHT.
[ct=6302.209] LET'S LOOK AT THE MIAMI
[ct=6302.796] SCHEDULE.
[ct=6307.730] TUA IN THE CONCUSSION PROTOCOL.
[ct=6309.452] THEY HAVE 10 DAYS.
[ct=6312.097] THEY GO FROM MIAMI TO SEATTLE.
[ct=6312.633] THEY COME BACK AND PLAY
[ct=6316.340] TENNESSEE HERE AND THEN AT NEW
[ct=6316.340] ENGLAND.
[ct=6318.069] LOOKING AT THE TWO BEST TEAMS IN
[ct=6321.053] THE DIVISION COMING INTO THE
[ct=6322.309] THEY HAVE THE JETS AND NEW
[ct=6323.107] ENGLAND -- WHO KNOWS.
[ct=6328.895] A BYE WEEK COMES IN WEEK SIX.
[ct=6328.895] THOMPSON HAS TO START AND IF TUA
[ct=6332.838] CANNOT COME BACK, TIM BOYLE WHO
[ct=6335.642] WE SAW LAST YEAR WITH THE JETS
[ct=6337.865] IS ON THE PRACTICE SQUAD SO HE
[ct=6338.286] WOULD BE THE BACKUP.
[ct=6341.562] UNLESS MARINO COMES OUT OF
[ct=6342.044] RETIREMENT.
[ct=6346.311] AL: 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=6346.789] STAYING AT HIS FEET.
[ct=6350.307] NICE NUMBERS TONIGHT.
[ct=6357.273] HE HAS 53 YARDS, AND THAT IS A
[ct=6358.002] 16 YARD GAME TO GO W
[ct=6358.618] THE GROUND.
[ct=6361.570] KIRK: I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS
[ct=6362.749] A BIGGER DEAL THAN IT IS.
[ct=6366.169] IT IS 31-10.
[ct=6367.090] THE OFFENSES IS ON THE FIELD.
[ct=6372.450] -- THE OFFENSE IS ON THE FIELD.
[ct=6375.396] THERE ARE 15 MORE GAMES TO GO.
[ct=6378.482] YOU WOULD LOVE TO SEE THEM UP
[ct=6379.113] WATCHING AND INVOLVED.
[ct=6380.206] TONIGHT IS NOT JUST ABOUT X'S
[ct=6382.772] AND O'S.
[ct=6386.259] BUFFALO SHOWED UP AND PLAYED AS
[ct=6386.259] A TEAM.
[ct=6390.150] THEY SHOWED THE LEAGUE THAT
[ct=6392.076] WITHOUT STEPHAN DIGGS THIS WILL
[ct=6394.817] BE THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD.
[ct=6396.005] THEY HAVE JOSH ALLEN AND A BUNCH
[ct=6399.614] OF GUYS AND THEY TOLD THE FIELD.
[ct=6401.423] THEY LOST ONE OF THEIR STARTERS
[ct=6402.732] TO AN INJURY AND ALREADY DID NOT
[ct=6404.891] HAVE JOHNSON.
[ct=6409.319] AND THEY PLAYED WITH A MASSIVE
[ct=6409.995] CHIP ON THEIR SHOULDER AS A
[ct=6412.318] GROUP AND THEN YOU SEE TYREEK
[ct=6417.899] HILL AND WADDLE TO GO WITH FIVE
[ct=6419.313] MINUTES LEFT IN THE GAME AND IT
[ct=6420.419] IS A DIFFERENT VIBE FROM WHAT
[ct=6421.081] YOU SEE ON THE OTHER SIDELINE.
[ct=6425.459] AL: IT IS ALSO THE LOOK OF A
[ct=6427.734] TEAM DOWN BY 21 POINTS AND CAN'T
[ct=6428.512] DO ANYTHING AND HAS A
[ct=6430.929] QUARTERBACK IN CONCUSSION
[ct=6435.186] THROWING OFF HIS BACK FOOT.
[ct=6436.662] HIS BIG NIGHT CONTINUES AT LEAST
[ct=6439.973] ON THE STAT SHEET FOR HIM AND
[ct=6439.973] THAT IS A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=6443.174] A STATEMENT GAME IS USED TO TO
[ct=6443.761] MUCH.
[ct=6446.272] BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT,
[ct=6446.838] BUFFALO IS MAKING AN EARLY
[ct=6453.733] STATEMENT -- AN EARLY SEASON
[ct=6454.165] STATEMENT WITH A BOWL HORN
[ct=6457.184] KIRK: JOSH ALLEN HAS DOMINATED
[ct=6460.580] MIAMI BUT IT IS EARLY SEPTEMBER
[ct=6460.865] AND IT IS HOT.
[ct=6464.035] CAN BUFFALO COME DOWN HERE AND
[ct=6464.414] WIN THIS GAME?
[ct=6470.236] FROM THE WORD "GO" THEY BEAT
[ct=6470.701] THEM AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=6472.649] WE DON'T TALK A LOT ABOUT THE
[ct=6476.223] OFFENSE, IT WAS REALLY ABOUT THE
[ct=6477.659] DEFENSE, THERE TURNOVERS AND
[ct=6479.364] GOING BACK TO THAT COLLECTIVE
[ct=6479.983] ATTITUDE THAT THEY PLAY WITH.
[ct=6483.157] AL:NS PLAYED IN THE OLD
[ct=6488.113] ORANGE BOWL AND MOVED IN HERE IN
[ct=6488.113] 1987.
[ct=6491.095] THIS IS WHERE THE MARLINS. THE
[ct=6493.314] EXPANSION FRANCHISE BEFORE THEY
[ct=6494.084] BUILT THEIR OWN STADIUM.
[ct=6497.719] THEY DID WIN A WORLD SERIES IN
[ct=6498.242] THIS BALLPARK.
[ct=6518.818] KIRK: WHO IS THE SECOND BASEMAN?
[ct=6523.404] CRAIG COUNSEL.
[ct=6525.927] AL: NOW A MANAGER WITH THE CUBS.
[ct=6528.349] NO.
[ct=6530.836] WHO DOES HE MANAGE?
[ct=6537.004] KIRK: BREWERS?
[ct=6542.215] AL: WE ARE AT THAT POINT, SORRY
[ct=6542.215] FOLKS.
[ct=6556.009] GEORGE HILL.
[ct=6559.275] KIRK: AFTER THE HIP SURGERY,
[ct=6560.777] LOOKING GREAT.
[ct=6566.113] DARREN IS BACK, TONY IS BACK.
[ct=6580.385] AL: 3:00 LEFT IN THE FOURTH.
[ct=6585.463] YOU HAVE FOUR RECEIVERS BUNCHED
[ct=6588.136] TO THE RIGHT SIDE, TOP SIMMER
[ct=6589.795] FIRE TO THE END ZONE, ALMOST,
[ct=6593.643] JULIAN HILL TRIED TO MAKE THE
[ct=6596.774] KIRK: A GOOD THROW BY THOMPSON
[ct=6598.537] IN BETWEEN THREE DEFENDERS.
[ct=6601.597] WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT SEEM
[ct=6602.619] ROUND, I THINK OF JONNU SMITH,
[ct=6604.737] BUT THE SECOND TIME THEY HAVE
[ct=6606.087] TRIED TO GET THE BALL TO JULIAN
[ct=6610.557] HE ALMOST CAME DOWN WITH THAT
[ct=6610.557] ONE.
[ct=6612.332] HE GAVE THEM A CHANCE.
[ct=6615.949] THE SPLIT SAFETIES IS WHERE YOU
[ct=6615.949] ATTACK.
[ct=6619.215] HE CAME CLOSE TO GETTING THAT
[ct=6627.998] AL: SECOND AND 10.
[ct=6630.996] IT IS CAUGHT AT THE 15.
[ct=6635.624] ONE WAY TO KEEP AN AUDIENCE IN A
[ct=6638.768] BLOWOUT GAME LIKE THIS, THERE IS
[ct=6639.327] SOMETHING IN PLAY.
[ct=6642.493] KIRK: ONE THING IS NOT.
[ct=6650.046] AL: HOWEVER, AT 41 POINTS, A FEW
[ct=6652.914] HEARTS WERE BEATING RAPIDLY WHEN
[ct=6654.368] THAT PASS WAS DROPPED IN THE END
[ct=6662.801] THIRD AND 2.
[ct=6672.439] THOMPSON FIRES, BROKEN UP AT THE
[ct=6672.727] GOAL LINE.
[ct=6680.032] KIRK: THESE CORNERS HAVE PLAYED
[ct=6681.413] GREAT FOOTBALL TONIGHT.
[ct=6686.173] BENFORD IS 6’
[ct=6687.668] BENFORD IS 6'1", OUT OF
[ct=6688.015] VILLANOVA.
[ct=6696.296] BENFORD LAST YEAR BECAME THE GUY
[ct=6696.849] AND CONTINUES THIS YEAR.
[ct=6701.289] I'LL GIVE ASIDE, DOUGLAS, BOTH
[ct=6702.289] GUYS HAVE PLAYED WELL.
[ct=6713.059] THOMPSON PRESSURED, THROWS,
[ct=6720.470] INTENDED FOR ROBBIE CHOSEN,
[ct=6725.699] THEY WILL TURN IT OVER ON DOWNS.
[ct=6729.631] KIRK: THIS ROOKIE OUT OF UTAH,
[ct=6730.559] COLE BISHOP, MAKES A GREAT PLAY
[ct=6731.153] ON THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=6733.539] HE GIVES HIM A LITTLE BIT OF A
[ct=6733.539] CUSHION.
[ct=6736.606] HE LOCATES THE FOOTBALL EARLY
[ct=6740.628] AND IT ALLOWS HIM TO TIME IT TO
[ct=6744.091] HE IS A BALL HAWK.
[ct=6749.483] HE IS OUT OF A GREAT, AGGRESSIVE
[ct=6749.483] PROGRAM.
[ct=6753.992] AL: THEY LOST BOTH SAFETIES.
[ct=6757.580] MICAH HYDE HAS NOT BEEN SIGNED.
[ct=6761.408] ONE OF THE THINGS IN THE DRAFT,
[ct=6761.977] THEY NOT ONLY NEED A RECEIVER
[ct=6764.345] BUT LOOKING FOR A SAFETY AND
[ct=6765.881] WOUND UP WITH BISHOP.
[ct=6769.808] KIRK: IT IS A BIG WIN FOR
[ct=6774.477] IT IS A DIVISION MATCHUP, AND
[ct=6775.922] WAS MORE OF A CHALLENGE TO COME
[ct=6780.065] JOSH TOLD US LAST NIGHT, I DO
[ct=6781.343] NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT MIAMI
[ct=6785.414] BUT I PLAY WITH A GREAT DEAL OF
[ct=6785.414] CONFIDENCE.
[ct=6791.580] AL: 1:57 TO GO.
[ct=6796.365] THE WILL BE WITH THE PLAYER
[ct=6801.158] THE BILLS TAKE OVER ON A SECOND
[ct=6802.452] AND 9.
[ct=6804.711] TRYING TO TAKE IT TO THE FINISH.
[ct=6808.218] KAYLEE, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
[ct=6813.648] KAYLEE: TUA IS IN THE DOLPHINS
[ct=6815.669] LOCKER ROOM, WE HAVE SEEN HIS
[ct=6816.937] WIFE AND CHILDREN AND HIS
[ct=6818.462] BROTHER, HE IS CONSCIOUS, AWAKE
[ct=6819.674] AND ALERT AS HE WAS WHEN YOU SAW
[ct=6823.103] HIM WALKING OFF THE FIELD UNDER
[ct=6823.103] HIS OWN POWER.
[ct=6826.188] HE HAS FULL MOVEMENT IN HIS
[ct=6826.752] EXTREMITIES.
[ct=6831.097] AL: THAT IS THE GOOD NEWS, WE
[ct=6831.097] WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS DOWN THE
[ct=6835.194] WE HAVE SEEN ENOUGH, WHEN HE
[ct=6836.270] GETS HER AND WHAT THAT MEANT A
[ct=6836.841] COUPLE YEARS AGO.
[ct=6839.515] WE WERE IN CINCINNATI THAT
[ct=6840.052] NIGHT.
[ct=6843.037] UNBELIEVABLE HE CAME BACK.
[ct=6849.970] A LITTLE VICTORY FORMATION, AND
[ct=6850.264] THE BUFFALO BILLS HAVE OWNED THE
[ct=6854.903] LOOK AT THIS, THE LAST 12 GAMES
[ct=6858.185] COMING IN, 11-1, THEY WIN
[ct=6860.629] POINT DIFFERENTIAL PER GAME,
[ct=6878.029] ON A HOT AND STICKY
[ct=6878.832] NIGHT LIKE TONIGHT.
[ct=6879.333] TONIGHT IT IS LIKE, FORGET ABOUT
[ct=6881.137] IT, IT IS ALL BUFFALO.
[ct=6885.077] KIRK: THIS IS A LOT ABOUT WHAT
[ct=6885.659] IS RIGHT WITH BUFFALO.
[ct=6889.828] WEEK 2, A LONG WAY TO GO BUT
[ct=6891.530] THERE IS A LOT TO LIKE ABOUT
[ct=6894.815] THIS BUFFALO BILL'S TEAM.
[ct=6902.163] AL: THE GANG IS LOOKING TO GET
[ct=6904.287] AN EXTRA THREE DAYS OFF.
[ct=6909.268] FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY
[ct=6911.322] MAKE THE LONG TRIP TO SEATTLE A
[ct=6912.066] WEEK FROM SUNDAY.
[ct=6915.155] VON MILLER, SACKS IN BACK TO
[ct=6916.063] BACK GAMES TO START THIS SEASON.
[ct=6921.295] BUFFALO WINS HANDILY WITH A BIG
[ct=6922.272] LEAD AT THE HALF.
[ct=6924.918] 24-10.
