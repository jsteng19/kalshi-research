[ct=11.492] GREEN BAY WON THE

[ct=45.355] BALTIMORE HAS HAD ITS
[ct=46.382] PROBLEMS, LAMAR
[ct=48.280] JACKSON, HIS NUMBERS
[ct=48.909] WOULD PUT HIM IN THAT

[ct=52.694] >> Al: START WITH

[ct=85.627] AND RIGHT NOW PLAYING
[ct=87.168] WITH FOUR D-LINEMEN IN

[ct=92.316] PLAYING MUCH BETTER
[ct=92.933] AGAINST THE LINE IN
[ct=95.230] RECENT WEEKS.
[ct=95.532] >> Al: QUICK PASS, OUT
[ct=99.242] TO THE 37.
[ct=99.242] AMON-RA ST. BROWN
[ct=100.568] MAKES THE GRAB, HIS
[ct=101.455] 77th CATCH OF THE
[ct=110.444] ISAIAH MAKES THE
[ct=110.712] TACKLE.
[ct=111.649] >> Kirk: BEN JOHNSON
[ct=113.149] COORDINATOR ONE OF THE
[ct=114.050] HOT NAMES LAST YEAR
[ct=115.238] AND THIS YEAR AS FAR
[ct=115.849] AS FUTURE HEAD
[ct=117.476] COACHES.
[ct=117.755] HE AND GOFF, THE
[ct=118.442] CONNECTION THEY HAVE.
[ct=120.736] THE COMMAND GOFF HAS
[ct=121.312] ESPECIALLY IN THESE
[ct=123.774] SITUATIONS AT THE LINE
[ct=124.033] OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=127.336] >> Al: ST. BROWN IN
[ct=127.581] MOTION.
[ct=127.817] LOOKING THAT WAY IS
[ct=129.187] GOFF.
[ct=129.187] THROWING THAT WAY IS
[ct=130.408] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=131.020] BACK-TO-BACK
[ct=132.020] RECEPTIONS FOR ST.
[ct=132.697] BROWN.
[ct=133.167] RECOVERING ON THE
[ct=133.733] PLAY.
[ct=134.549] >> Kirk: THIS IS THE
[ct=136.780] THING THAT THIS LIONS
[ct=137.074] OFFENSE IS KNOWN FOR,
[ct=137.993] THE MOVEMENT.
[ct=138.930] HOW DO YOU GET 14
[ct=139.532] OPEN?
[ct=140.184] WELL, YOU MOVE HIM.
[ct=141.787] EXPECTING HIM TO GET
[ct=143.285] INVOLVED.
[ct=143.733] THEY WANT TO GET HANDS
[ct=144.846] ON HIM.
[ct=146.446] YOU CAN’T.
[ct=146.691] WHEN YOU MOVE HIM, YOU
[ct=147.367] CAN SEE THAT SOFT
[ct=148.276] COVERAGE THERE ALLOWS
[ct=150.594] HIM TO GET UP AND OUT.
[ct=151.615] BULLARD DOESN’T HAVE
[ct=152.526] ANY CHANCE, AND
[ct=153.660] THERE’S THE ACCURACY,
[ct=155.877] OF COURSE, FROM GOFF.
[ct=160.411] >> Al: PLAY ACTION.
[ct=161.132] FIRED OVER THE MIDDLE,
[ct=161.999] AND ST. BROWN WAS
[ct=162.955] THERE, COULD NOT HOLD
[ct=163.944] ON.
[ct=171.153] COVER ON THE PLAY BY
[ct=178.965] KEISEAN NIXON.
[ct=180.801] >> Kirk: THE ACCURACY,
[ct=181.839] THE FANS WANTED THAT
[ct=184.764] RIGHT ARM LEANING OVER
[ct=185.686] THE TOP OF SAINT BROWN
[ct=186.780] AND A CALL TO BE MADE,
[ct=187.807] BUT THAT IS PERFECTLY
[ct=188.685] EXCOO UTED MANNED
[ct=189.615] COVERAGE THERE BY THE
[ct=193.307] CORNER NIXON.
[ct=194.610] >> Al: NOW YOU’VE GOT
[ct=195.593] WILLIAMS WITH BROWN ON
[ct=195.947] THE RIGHT SIDE.
[ct=197.716] 2nd AND 10 FROM THE
[ct=198.689] 42.
[ct=198.960] WILLIAMS GOES IN
[ct=201.680] KEEP IT ON THE GROUND,
[ct=204.723] MONTGOMERY, FIRST DOWN
[ct=206.164] IN THE GREEN BAY
[ct=206.971] TERRITORY.
[ct=209.752] TACKLED BY McKINNEY.
[ct=211.069] >> Kirk: THIS IS WHAT
[ct=211.763] MONTGOMERY BRINGS TO
[ct=212.619] THE TABLE WITH THESE
[ct=213.211] TWO BACKS.
[ct=214.419] YOU’LL SEE THE RIGHT
[ct=216.915] GUARD 71 AND 87 PULL
[ct=217.460] AROUND.
[ct=218.255] BUT THE PACKERS TO
[ct=220.799] THEIR CREDIT THEY BLOW
[ct=220.799] THIS PLAY UP.
[ct=226.117] I MEAN CLAY WALKER
[ct=227.092] GETS DOWN THERE, BUT
[ct=229.279] PHYSICALITY.
[ct=229.490] WILLIAMS BLOCK OUT
[ct=230.476] THERE ON THE CORNER
[ct=231.303] SPRUNG HIM FREE, BUT
[ct=232.172] THE PACKERS DID
[ct=232.678] EVERYTHING THEY WANTED
[ct=234.613] TO DO THERE TO DEFEND
[ct=235.425] THAT.
[ct=236.186] BUT THE BALANCE AND
[ct=236.996] THE STRENGTH OF THE
[ct=238.658] BACK, MONTGOMERY, GETS
[ct=239.886] HIM OUT IN THE OPEN.
[ct=241.700] >> Al: NOW, JAHMYR
[ct=243.322] GIBBS COMES IN.
[ct=244.956] HE’S 27 YARDS SHY OF
[ct=246.823] 1,000.
[ct=249.398] MAKES THE GRAB, ON THE
[ct=250.845] MOVE, TACKLED AT THE
[ct=252.574] 38 YARD LINE.
[ct=255.188] HE CAN RUN, CAN CATCH.
[ct=256.638] BULLARD MAKES THAT
[ct=262.911] >> Kirk: HOW GREAT IS
[ct=263.196] IT?
[ct=263.569] IT’S THE BEST TANDEM
[ct=264.228] OF BACKS IN THE NFL.
[ct=264.567] WE ALREADY SAW
[ct=264.855] MONTGOMERY WHAT HE CAN
[ct=265.714] DO WITH THE POWER TO
[ct=266.457] SHAKE FREE.
[ct=267.323] THEN YOU BRING GIBBS
[ct=269.809] IN, KEEPS BOTH THESE
[ct=270.088] GUYS FRESH.
[ct=273.610] HE GETS OUT INTO OPEN
[ct=274.992] FIELD AND IS SO
[ct=275.274] DANGEROUS.
[ct=276.025] THAT TIME HE DIDN’T
[ct=277.083] HAVE A TIME TO USE
[ct=277.882] LINEMEN AND STILL
[ct=279.071] PICKS UP POSITIVE
[ct=280.137] YARDS.
[ct=280.494] COMES BACK IN.
[ct=282.237] AGAIN A SHORT DROP,
[ct=283.101] QUICK THROW, AND IT’S
[ct=286.075] WILLIAMS AT THE FIRST
[ct=286.823] DOWN MARKER BUT
[ct=292.776] JAMESON WILLIAMS CAN’T
[ct=294.155] HOLD ON.
[ct=294.499] IT’LL BE 3rd DOWN AND
[ct=298.080] 3.
[ct=305.319] >> Kirk: WITH EDGERRIN
[ct=306.869] COOPER OUT, MONTGOMERY
[ct=308.306] JUST A LITTLE BIT LATE
[ct=310.921] IN GETTING UP THERE
[ct=311.574] AND McDUFFIE ABLE TO
[ct=312.500] EFFECT THAT.
[ct=313.711] STILL HE GOT IT OFF.
[ct=314.039] GOOD COVERAGE
[ct=315.716] DOWNFIELD.
[ct=316.855] >> Al: OPENING DRIVE
[ct=317.643] OF THE GAME, THIRD
[ct=319.863] PLAY HERE.
[ct=321.545] 3rd DOWN AND 3.
[ct=322.182] HANGS IN THE POCKET,
[ct=324.223] FIRES, WILLIAMS OUT OF
[ct=325.548] BOUNDS AT THE 10 YARD
[ct=329.092] JAMESON WILLIAMS.

[ct=330.694] PLAYING A LOT OF ZONE.
[ct=332.302] HERE ON THIRD DOWN
[ct=332.985] THEY GO MAN-TO-MAN.
[ct=334.128] IT’S A TOUGH MATCHUP.
[ct=335.441] ONCE YOU’RE ABLE TO --
[ct=337.661] THIS IS SPEEDSTER, AND
[ct=338.771] THIS IS BULLARD WHO IS
[ct=340.400] PLAYING NICKEL, TOUGH
[ct=341.743] MATCHUP FOR HIM.
[ct=343.057] YOU CAN SEE THE
[ct=343.057] SEPARATION.
[ct=344.379] AND HOW ABOUT GOFF
[ct=344.379] HERE, WORKING THROUGH
[ct=345.706] HIS PROGRESSIONS?
[ct=347.018] THIS IS REALLY WHERE
[ct=347.018] HE HAS GROWN.
[ct=348.380] ONCE HE HAS THE TIME
[ct=349.657] TO BE ABLE TO MAKE
[ct=351.000] THIS THROW, HE SETS
[ct=352.373] THOSE FEET, AND IT IS
[ct=353.650] RIGHT ON THE MONEY FOR
[ct=354.985] ANOTHER FIRST DOWN
[ct=357.653] IT’S 2-2 NOW ON THIRD
[ct=358.677] >> Al: AND RIGHT AT
[ct=360.714] THE 10, SO IT’S 1st
[ct=361.578] AND GOAL.
[ct=362.635] TO THE OUTSIDE GOES

[ct=367.718] ON THE SAME PLAY AS HE
[ct=369.180] PUSHED OUT OF BOUNDS
[ct=370.695] AT THE 11 YARD LINE.
[ct=372.773] LEFT TACKLE SKIPPER
[ct=373.823] WHO’S IN FOR TAYLOR
[ct=375.804] DECKER, HE’S A BIG
[ct=376.784] PHYSICAL GUY THAT
[ct=377.616] TIME.
[ct=378.433] HE LOST LEVERAGE AND
[ct=380.323] HAD TO GRAB ONTO THE
[ct=382.312] PACKERS.
[ct=384.498] >> Al: DETROIT ALREADY
[ct=387.146] WALKING BACK.
[ct=387.146] DOING DOUBLE DUTY THIS
[ct=388.515] WEEK.
[ct=389.330] HE REFFED A MONDAY
[ct=391.059] NIGHT GAME.
[ct=392.206] SO WORKING ON TWO DAYS
[ct=392.877] REST.
[ct=394.394] HERE HE IS.

[ct=402.993] HE GETS BOTH HIS HANDS
[ct=404.604] ON HIM, SEES THE BALL
[ct=405.590] GOING TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=406.369] NOW HE’S ABLE TO GET
[ct=407.185] TOUT THERE AND HE
[ct=408.424] CANNOT BECAUSE OF THAT
[ct=409.189] GRAB THERE BY DAN
[ct=410.369] SKIPPER.
[ct=410.682] GOOD CALL THERE BY THE
[ct=411.877] OFFICIAL.
[ct=413.193] >> Al: AGAIN, MINUS
[ct=414.011] TAYLOR DECKER, THE
[ct=415.449] GREAT LEFT TACKLE.
[ct=416.769] SKIPPER’S BEEN IN AND
[ct=417.800] OUT OF THE DETROIT
[ct=418.477] ORGANIZATION LIKE FOUR
[ct=420.048] TIMES ALREADY IN HIS
[ct=421.322] CAREER.
[ct=421.631] BACK AND FORTH HE
[ct=422.367] GOES.
[ct=422.989] MONTGOMERY AND GIBBS
[ct=426.123] BOTH IN THE GAME.
[ct=427.072] OFF THE FAKE.
[ct=428.540] GIBBS MAKES THE CATCH.
[ct=429.287] WORKS HIS WAY TO THE
[ct=430.921] 13 YARD LINE.
[ct=433.320] McDUFFIE.
[ct=434.748] IT’LL BE 2nd DOWN AND
[ct=435.973] GOAL FOR THE LIONS.
[ct=437.621] >> Kirk: WHEN THEY
[ct=439.329] DRAFTED HIM OUT OF
[ct=439.734] ALABAMA, I NEVER TRY
[ct=440.017] TO PUT THIS PRESSURE
[ct=441.222] ON HIM TO BE THE NEXT
[ct=442.806] CHRISTIAN McCAFFREY,
[ct=444.060] BUT HE REMINDS YOU OF
[ct=445.651] THAT KIND OF SKILL SET
[ct=446.209] AS FAR AS HIS ABILITY
[ct=446.878] TO RUN.
[ct=448.050] HE’S A THREE DOWN
[ct=448.756] BACK.
[ct=449.683] AND NOW BECAUSE YOU
[ct=450.909] HAVE TWO BACKS HERE IN
[ct=451.719] MONTGOMERY, YOU’RE
[ct=454.076] ABLE TO GET HIM AND
[ct=454.361] KEEP HIM FRESH FOR
[ct=454.978] FOUR QUARTERS AND
[ct=457.162] HOPEFULLY THROUGHOUT
[ct=457.621] THE WHOLE YEAR.
[ct=458.261] YOU CAN ALREADY SENSE
[ct=459.318] THEY WANT TO GET HIM
[ct=460.395] IN SPACE EVERY WEEK
[ct=461.492] BUT ESPECIALLY HERE
[ct=461.990] TONIGHT AGAINST THE

[ct=479.993] 3rd DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=480.498] >> Kirk: THEY’RE SIXTH
[ct=486.671] IN THE NFL, BUT THEY
[ct=486.671] HAVE HAD SOME ISSUES
[ct=486.890] IN SOME GAMES.
[ct=487.390] LAST WEEK 2-5 IN A RED
[ct=487.625] ZONE.
[ct=488.031] SO AGAINST JORDAN LOVE

[ct=523.177] >> Kirk: WHAT I SAW
[ct=524.008] WAS THE TOM OF THE

[ct=525.244] AT THE TOP OF THE
[ct=526.217] ROUTE HE GRABBED ONTO
[ct=527.494] THE SHOULDER PAD, ONTO
[ct=529.724] THE JERSEY.
[ct=530.068] IT WASN’T AT THE END
[ct=531.684] YOU COULD SAY, HEY,
[ct=533.807] INTERFERENCE.
[ct=535.207] LET’S SEE HERE TOP OF
[ct=535.975] THE ROUTE HE GETS A
[ct=537.103] LITTLE HANDSY.
[ct=537.917] WATCH HIM WORK TO OUR

[ct=540.518] THAT JERSEY, SLOWS HIM
[ct=541.572] DOWN ENOUGH FOR THE
[ct=543.494] OFFICIAL TO CALL THAT.
[ct=544.621] >> Referee: PRIOR TO
[ct=549.090] THE PASS ILLEGAL
[ct=552.414] CONTACT DEFENSE.
[ct=555.685] >> Kirk: YEAH, GET A
[ct=555.685] LITTLE CLARIFICATION

[ct=557.848] CORRECTION.
[ct=558.197] THERE’S ONLY ONE FOUL
[ct=559.847] PRIOR TO THE PASS,
[ct=561.518] ILLEGAL CONTACT,
[ct=563.164] DEFENSE.
[ct=563.875] PENALTY’S HALF OF THIS

[ct=566.662] AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
[ct=569.547] THAT’S WHAT HE’S
[ct=570.252] REFERRING TO.
[ct=570.781] THE BALL WAS NOT YET
[ct=571.021] IN THE AIR WHEN HE
[ct=571.737] MADE THAT CONTACT.
[ct=572.576] I TALKED ABOUT IT
[ct=573.517] WASN’T NEAR THE END
[ct=574.695] WHERE A LOT OF TIMES
[ct=576.657] IT WAS AN ILLEGAL
[ct=578.016] CONTACT CALL, AND THE
[ct=579.273] BALL HAD NOT YET LEFT
[ct=580.608] THE HAND OF GOFF, SO
[ct=581.612] THEY CATCH A BREAK
[ct=583.563] THERE ON THIRD DOWN.

[ct=821.929] FOR A LOT OF DEFENSIVE
[ct=823.447] HOLDINGS AND PI’S A

[ct=835.629] THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=837.529] 32, HE GIVES HIM A
[ct=838.453] CUSHION.
[ct=839.104] 32, LEVERAGE, AND HE
[ct=839.804] GETS TURNED.
[ct=840.736] ONCE HE GETS TURNED,
[ct=842.027] HE’S BEATEN, USES THAT
[ct=842.997] LEFT HAND TO GROOB
[ct=844.881] ONTO HIM, AND

[ct=861.615] RAIDERS.
[ct=862.060] STOPPED THERE BY
[ct=864.266] McNEILL.
[ct=868.235] >> Kirk: WITH THESE

[ct=900.262] PUSHES HIM, MAYBE
[ct=900.487] HOLDS ON.
[ct=902.118] BUT THAT POWER HE HAS,
[ct=903.371] A REALLY GOOD LOOK
[ct=904.947] FROM BEHIND TO SEE HE
[ct=906.078] GETS RID OF TOM.
[ct=907.367] THAT’S A BIG LINEMAN.
[ct=908.363] HE JUST THROWS TO THE
[ct=909.912] GROUND AND THEN MAKES
[ct=911.700] THE PLAY.

[ct=1302.621] DOES ANYTHING JUST TO
[ct=1304.165] GET IT AWAY, WHICH HE
[ct=1306.833] DOES.
[ct=1307.674] EZEKIEL TURNER THAT
[ct=1308.116] TIME COMING IN,
[ct=1309.337] PUTTING THE HEAT ON
[ct=1313.164] 4th AND 5.
[ct=1314.376] BRINGING PRESSURE, BUT
[ct=1315.402] I’LL TELL YOU HAVING A
[ct=1316.328] GAME IS THE GUY IN THE
[ct=1317.519] MIDDLE.
[ct=1318.842] LOOK AT THAT GET OFF
[ct=1320.269] WITH O’CONNOR, PAT
[ct=1321.677] O’CONNOR, OUT OF
[ct=1323.250] EASTERN MICHIGAN.
[ct=1323.561] WITH THESE GUYS THAT
[ct=1325.327] ARE DOWN, HE HAS
[ct=1325.980] STEPPED UP WITH HIS
[ct=1326.784] OPPORTUNITY, SECOND
[ct=1327.367] TIME WE’VE SEEN HIM
[ct=1328.643] GET OFF THE BALL IN
[ct=1329.568] PLUS TERRITORY.
[ct=1330.448] THEY’RE GOING FOR IT.
[ct=1333.905] >> Al: YEP, 4th AND 5.
[ct=1334.853] AT LEAST LINING UP TO
[ct=1338.113] GO FOR IT.
[ct=1338.629] SCOREBOARD HAS THE
[ct=1339.849] DECIBEL LEVEL AT 115.
[ct=1344.314] THAT’S WHAT IT IS IN
[ct=1345.414] AN AIRPORT.
[ct=1358.181] CLAP, CLAP, CLAP, AND
[ct=1359.465] SNOW
[ct=1359.713] NO SNATCH.
[ct=1360.774] JUST TRYING TO LOOK TO
[ct=1361.970] DRAW THEM OFF SIDE AND
[ct=1362.982] THEY CAN’T.
[ct=1364.790] NOW COMES THE PUNT
[ct=1365.428] GROUP.
[ct=1365.706] >> Kirk: YOU GO BACK
[ct=1368.248] AND TAKE A PEEK WITH
[ct=1369.285] THE HIT ON JORDAN
[ct=1371.103] LOVE, I’D RUFB TO ASK
[ct=1372.164] TERRY HIS OPINION
[ct=1373.342] WHAT DO YOU SEE AFTER
[ct=1376.531] HE RELEASES THE
[ct=1376.531] FOOTBALL?
[ct=1377.132] >> IT SURE LOOKS THIS
[ct=1377.828] IS FORCED CONTACT.
[ct=1379.132] ROUGHING THE PASSER
[ct=1379.754] SHOULD HAVE BEEN
[ct=1380.939] CALLED ON THIS ONE.
[ct=1382.316] >> Kirk: Za’DARIUS
[ct=1384.746] SMITH WITH THE RIGHT
[ct=1386.089] HAND CAME THROUGH,
[ct=1387.082] CLUBBED HIM WITH THE
[ct=1388.564] FACE MASK.
[ct=1389.556] >> Al: MISSED THAT
[ct=1389.803] ONE.
[ct=1390.997] LOVE TO THE BENCH.
[ct=1393.584] IN COMES THE PUNT
[ct=1396.067] DAN WHELAN, HIS FIRST
[ct=1402.214] PUNT WAS 43 YARDS.
[ct=1403.571] MORICE ALEXANDER TO
[ct=1405.472] RECEIVE IT.
[ct=1407.685] ALEXANDER CALLS FOR A
[ct=1408.328] FAIR CATCH.
[ct=1409.190] MAKES IT AT THE 11
[ct=1413.778] THE HIT TO THE HEAD
[ct=1415.971] WAS MISSED.
[ct=1416.483] 3:50 TO GO IN THE
[ct=1421.539] OPENING QUARTER.RANKS AND
[ct=1423.506] BATMAN.
[ct=1425.476] DOWNTOWN DETROIT.
[ct=1426.804] BACK WE COME
[ct=1429.672] WILLIAMS, HE GETS
[ct=1430.676] BUMPED OUT OF BOUNDS
[ct=1432.634] FOR A GAIN OF ABOUT 6
[ct=1433.817] BY CARRINGTON
[ct=1435.833] VALENTINE.
[ct=1436.756] 2nd DOWN.
[ct=1440.098] >> Kirk: WE SAW A
[ct=1441.339] CONVERS WHEN THEY
[ct=1441.544] MOVED ST. BROWN ON A
[ct=1442.102] SIMILAR PLAY.
[ct=1442.770] TAKING ADVANTAGE OF
[ct=1443.699] SOFT CUSHION AND
[ct=1444.690] CREATING SPACE AND
[ct=1445.327] MATCHUPS.
[ct=1446.370] THAT TIME FOR JAMESON
[ct=1447.725] WILLIAMS.
[ct=1449.671] >> Al: GREEN BAY MINUS
[ct=1452.571] JAIRE ALEXANDER, ONE
[ct=1453.235] OF THE TOP CORNERS IN
[ct=1453.515] THE LEAGUE.
[ct=1455.340] 2nd AND 4.
[ct=1458.204] FROM THE 17.
[ct=1459.597] OFF PLAY ACTION, GOFF
[ct=1460.582] ROLLING AND THROWING,
[ct=1462.018] AND JUST THROWS IT
[ct=1463.216] AWAY.
[ct=1464.592] TO THE DOWN MARKER,
[ct=1466.195] ERIC WILLIAMS CHASED
[ct=1466.807] HIM.
[ct=1471.148] 3rd AND 4.
[ct=1473.737] DIALING UP PRESSURE.
[ct=1474.853] THE LAST TIME WE SAW A
[ct=1475.634] LITTLE BIT MORE
[ct=1478.044] BLITZING, THIS TIME
[ct=1478.555] ACTUALLY HE BRINGS 45
[ct=1479.918] ERIC WILSON FROM THE
[ct=1481.470] FIELD, DOES A GOOD JOB
[ct=1482.544] FLUSHING HIM OUT OF
[ct=1484.880] THE POCKET, AND THAT’S
[ct=1485.461] THEIR WHOLE FOCUS
[ct=1487.095] ANY DEFENSIVE
[ct=1488.249] COORDINATOR KNOWS IF
[ct=1489.134] GOFF IS BACK THERE
[ct=1490.221] CLEAN, IT’S GOING TO
[ct=1492.369] BE A LONG NIGHT.
[ct=1493.984] >> Al: 3rd AND 4, KEEP
[ct=1495.103] IT ON THE GROUND, TRY
[ct=1496.068] TO GET THAT FIRST
[ct=1499.110] VERY CLOSE TO IT IS
[ct=1499.110] GIBBS.
[ct=1499.527] LET’S SEE WHERE THEY
[ct=1500.565] SPOT IT, AND COMING IN
[ct=1502.456] AS IF TO GIVE HIM THE
[ct=1505.253] 1st DOWN AND HE DOES.
[ct=1506.006] HE’S GOT ONE AT THE 21
[ct=1507.714] >> Kirk: THAT’S AN
[ct=1508.302] EXAMPLE THERE.
[ct=1509.306] 3rd AND 4, YOU WOULD
[ct=1510.925] THINK THE HAMMER DAVID
[ct=1512.157] MONTGOMERY WOULD COME
[ct=1512.924] IN THERE, RIGHT?
[ct=1514.044] YOU NEED SOME YARDS
[ct=1515.598] BETWEEN THE TACKLE.
[ct=1516.953] BUT, NO, GIBBS SHOWS
[ct=1518.644] HIS VERSATILITY, RUNS
[ct=1519.758] THROUGH A FEW ARM
[ct=1521.541] TACKLES.
[ct=1522.362] BOY, THAT WAS CLOSE.
[ct=1523.661] LOOKS THAT SECOND
[ct=1525.510] EFFORT GOT HIM ACROSS
[ct=1527.690] THE LINE THERE.
[ct=1528.229] >> Al: JUST OUTSIDE
[ct=1531.832] THE 20.
[ct=1532.102] AND NOW WE WERE
[ct=1532.884] THINKING, YEAH,
[ct=1536.807] SO LaFLEUR IS GOING TO
[ct=1537.965] CHALLENGE.
[ct=1541.163] THAT WAS A 3rd AND 4.
[ct=1542.073] SO IF HE WINS THE
[ct=1543.008] CHALLENGE, IT’LL BE
[ct=1544.680] 4th AND INCHES.
[ct=1546.286] >> Kirk: WELL, THE
[ct=1546.522] THING I THINK YOU’LL
[ct=1549.955] SEE IN MY OPINION EVAN
[ct=1550.185] WILLIAMS WHEN HE FIRST
[ct=1551.560] HIT HIM, 33, I THINK
[ct=1552.845] HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS
[ct=1553.578] SHORT.
[ct=1554.139] BUT WHEN HE TWISTED
[ct=1555.826] AND THEN KEPT MOVING,
[ct=1557.491] I THINK HE ENDED UP
[ct=1558.460] GETTING PASSED FOR THE
[ct=1562.140] >> Al: A CHALLENGE.
[ct=1562.727] TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT
[ct=1564.596] 2:30 TO GO IN THE
[ct=1565.770] QUARTER.
[ct=1566.033] THE VERDICT WHEN WE
[ct=1567.267] COME BACK.
[ct=1571.160] >> Referee: AFTER
[ct=1572.404] REVIEW, THE RUNNER DID
[ct=1573.758] MAKE THE LINE TO GAIN
[ct=1576.940] FOR A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1578.298] GREEN BAY IS CHARGED
[ct=1579.562] WITH A FIRST TIMEOUT
[ct=1581.714] FOR AN UNSUCCESSFUL
[ct=1582.687] THIS IS CONSIDERED
[ct=1584.946] THEIR FIRST CHALLENGE.
[ct=1587.277] >> Al: YEAH THAT’S
[ct=1588.425] A -- IT’S ALWAYS A
[ct=1588.966] TOUGH CHALLENGE TO WIN
[ct=1592.022] ON THE SPOT LIKE THAT.
[ct=1592.912] THAT EFFORT SPINNING
[ct=1593.272] AROUND THAT WAS A
[ct=1598.946] >> Kirk: THE OPPOSITE
[ct=1599.453] ANGLE.
[ct=1600.469] LIKE I SAID, WITHOUT
[ct=1601.351] THAT SECOND EFFORT I
[ct=1601.935] DON’T THINK HE GETS
[ct=1607.818] >> Al: GIBBS, NOTHING.
[ct=1608.098] TACKLE UP TO THE LINE
[ct=1609.375] OF SCRIM MG.
[ct=1611.172] CLARK NUMBER ONE PICK
[ct=1613.939] IN 2016 OUT OF UCLA.
[ct=1615.247] 2nd DOWN AND 10.
[ct=1615.866] >> Kirk: MOST OF HIS
[ct=1616.937] CAREER HE WAS KNOWN AS
[ct=1618.383] A GREAT PASS RUSHER
[ct=1618.721] AND GOOD AGAINST THE
[ct=1619.361] RUN THERE.
[ct=1621.713] HE GETS PENETRATION.
[ct=1622.872] TOUGH TO DO AGAINST
[ct=1623.223] THE CENTER, BUT HE
[ct=1623.850] DOES IT.
[ct=1625.318] WHAT IT DOES IS FREE
[ct=1626.116] THE LINE BACKERS TO
[ct=1627.420] GET DOWNHILL IN A
[ct=1632.611] HURRY WITH WALKER AND
[ct=1634.782] 10.
[ct=1640.954] TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=1641.805] GIBBS, STAYS ON HIS
[ct=1642.661] FEET.
[ct=1643.568] TURNS NOTHING INTO A
[ct=1645.152] LITTLE SOMETHING.
[ct=1647.422] BUT IT’LL BE 3rd DOWN
[ct=1647.422] AND 5.
[ct=1648.387] >> Kirk: I’LL TELL YOU
[ct=1648.921] GREEN BAY HOLDING
[ct=1649.840] THEIR OWN AT THE LINE
[ct=1651.371] AGAIN, THIS IS MAYBE
[ct=1652.329] THE BEST OFFENSIVE
[ct=1653.628] LINE IN THE GAME.
[ct=1655.324] HE HAD TO POUNCE THIS
[ct=1656.294] OUTSIDE.
[ct=1657.644] HOW ABOUT THE ROOKIE
[ct=1659.126] EVAN WILLIAMS, BUT
[ct=1660.111] THERE ONCE AGAIN IS
[ct=1661.132] GIBBS SHOWING YOU HE’S
[ct=1662.606] NOT JUST A GUY OUT IN
[ct=1663.886] SPACE.
[ct=1664.114] PHYSICAL RUNNER
[ct=1665.067] BOUNCING OFF OF THAT
[ct=1667.037] HIT BY EVAN WILLIAMS.
[ct=1668.223] DIDN’T WRAP UP, SO
[ct=1671.221] ABLE TO GET AROUND HIM
[ct=1674.119] FOR A FEW MORE YARDS.
[ct=1674.452] >> Al: 1:20
[ct=1676.994] THE QUARTER.
[ct=1683.059] GOING NOWHERE.
[ct=1683.992] COLBY WOODEN STOPS HIM
[ct=1685.550] IN HIS TRACKS.
[ct=1686.524] SECOND YEAR GUY OUT OF
[ct=1688.260] AUBURN.
[ct=1688.260] FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=1689.552] >> Kirk: AND AGAIN,
[ct=1690.901] LOOK, 77 IS ONE OF THE
[ct=1692.082] BEST CENTERS IN THE
[ct=1696.358] GAME.
[ct=1697.747] HE JUST OLAYS HIM WITH
[ct=1699.007] QUICKNESS.
[ct=1699.326] THEY ARE GETTING OFF
[ct=1700.493] THE BALL AT THE LINE
[ct=1701.350] OF SCRIMMAGE IN THE
[ct=1705.260] LAST TWO SERIES.
[ct=1705.893] THEY’RE WINNING A
[ct=1707.613] POINT UP FRONT.
[ct=1710.509] AND VERY HARD TO DO
[ct=1711.983] WITH THIS LINE.
[ct=1714.975] >> Al: FOX IS PUNT,
[ct=1715.817] FLAG IS THROWN, FAIR
[ct=1717.350] CATCH IS CALLED FOR,
[ct=1718.996] AND MADE AT THE 26
[ct=1734.735] SO JOHN HUSSEY HUSTLES
[ct=1736.271] AS I SAY, HE’S WORKING
[ct=1737.902] ON TWO DAYS REST.
[ct=1738.586] >> Kirk: YEAH, NOT
[ct=1742.901] EASY.
[ct=1745.434] >> Al: NO.
[ct=1747.027] >> Referee: DURING THE
[ct=1750.816] KICK, HOLDING,
[ct=1754.081] 10-YARD PENALTY, FIRST
[ct=1764.511] >> Al: 35 SECONDS LEFT
[ct=1767.075] IN THE FIRST QUARTER.
[ct=1768.900] LIONS ON TOP 7-0.
[ct=1774.515] THEIR 11th GAME IN A
[ct=1777.058] ROW.
[ct=1777.058] JACOBS AND BROOKS ARE
[ct=1781.114] BOTH IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=1787.748] JACOBS.
[ct=1788.007] HE’S HAVING A GREAT
[ct=1791.629] CHRIS BROOKS LEADING
[ct=1791.837] THE WAY.
[ct=1796.432] >> Kirk: HE SURE HAS.
[ct=1797.229] WE HAVEN’T HAD A
[ct=1797.916] CHANCE MUCH TO TALK
[ct=1799.274] ABOUT HIM.
[ct=1800.389] AARON JONES GOES TO
[ct=1802.022] MINNESOTA, AND JOSH
[ct=1802.673] JACOBS LAS VEGAS
[ct=1804.308] RAIDERS, WE HAD THEM
[ct=1804.595] LAST WEEK.
[ct=1805.512] I KNOW THEY WANTED TO
[ct=1806.586] HOLD ONTO HIM, BUT HE
[ct=1809.418] LEAVES, COMES TO GREEN
[ct=1809.984] BAY AND BRINGS A
[ct=1810.642] DIFFERENT KIND OF
[ct=1811.966] MORE DOWNHILL, MORE
[ct=1813.593] BEHIND THE TACKLES
[ct=1814.180] THAN WHO THEY WERE THE
[ct=1815.110] LAST FEW YEARS WITH
[ct=1816.482] AARON JONES, MORE ON
[ct=1819.023] THE EDGE OUTSIDE ZONE.
[ct=1819.237] >> Al: THAT LAST RUN
[ct=1820.789] TOOK HIM TO 1,000
[ct=1821.974] YARDS FOR THE SEASON.
[ct=1823.249] THAT’LL BE THE END OF
[ct=1826.321] THE FIRST QUARTER.
[ct=1829.105] WEEK FROM TONIGHT.
[ct=1829.694] MEANWHILE, McNEILL IS
[ct=1831.862] BACK IN THE GAME.
[ct=1833.260] >> Kirk: GREAT NEWS.
[ct=1834.038] >> Al: YEAH.
[ct=1835.260] MATT LaFLEUR TOLD US
[ct=1835.911] THIS WEEK HE’S A
[ct=1838.115] SEVERELY UNDERRATED
[ct=1838.881] PLAYER.
[ct=1839.599] PRESSURE IS PUT ON.
[ct=1842.021] PASS IS GOTTEN AWAY.
[ct=1843.968] CHRISTIAN WATSON WITH
[ct=1844.915] A NINTH MOVE AND LOSES
[ct=1845.183] THE BALL.
[ct=1847.517] AND FOR THE MOMENT THE
[ct=1849.303] LIONS HAVE IT.
[ct=1851.603] HE GOT CAUGHT BY
[ct=1854.627] CARLTON DAVIS, LOST IT
[ct=1857.473] ALONG THE SIDELINE AND
[ct=1858.163] STAYS INBOUNDS AND
[ct=1859.448] DETROIT WITH THE TAKE
[ct=1860.877] >> Kirk: DETROIT
[ct=1861.518] BRINGING A LOT OF
[ct=1864.721] THEY PLAY A LOT OF
[ct=1865.012] MAN-TO-MAN COVERAGE.
[ct=1866.064] NOBODY PICKS UP
[ct=1866.880] CHRISTIAN WATSON, AND
[ct=1868.109] THIS IS WHY YOU NEVER
[ct=1869.545] GIVE UP ON A PLAY.
[ct=1870.091] CUTS BACK AWAY FROM
[ct=1870.933] JOSEPH.
[ct=1872.039] WATCH FROM BEHIND, THE
[ct=1874.131] CRAFTY VETERAN.
[ct=1874.766] CARLTON DAVIS KNOCKS
[ct=1875.420] THAT BALL LOOSE, AND
[ct=1876.966] THE LIONS ARE ABLE TO
[ct=1880.676] POUNCE ON IT.
[ct=1882.315] NOT SURE KNEE IS OFF
[ct=1883.163] THE GROUND.
[ct=1883.716] AND IT IS.
[ct=1884.915] BALL IS IN THE AIR,
[ct=1885.783] DETROIT FOOTBALL.
[ct=1888.058] BUT THEY NOW HAVE
[ct=1889.755] BLITZED ON FIVE OF THE
[ct=1890.669] SEVEN DROP BACKS WITH
[ct=1891.757] ALL THESE NEW FACES.
[ct=1892.675] THAT TIME ONE OF THE
[ct=1894.087] NEW FACES, JONAH
[ct=1895.505] WILLIAMS, WHO APPLIED
[ct=1896.489] THE MOST PRESSURE.
[ct=1898.414] AND THE LIPS TALKED
[ct=1899.432] ABOUT TURN OVERS WITH
[ct=1900.423] US ALL WEEK AND THEY
[ct=1902.368] GOT ONE THERE.
[ct=1903.126] >> Al: AND DAVID LONG
[ct=1904.646] RECOVERED IT.
[ct=1905.658] NOW GOFF OFF THE PLAY
[ct=1906.871] FAKE, FIRES INTO
[ct=1907.055] TRAFFIC.
[ct=1907.969] AND THAT IS TAKEN IN
[ct=1909.035] THERE BY THE TIGHT
[ct=1910.998] END, SAM LaPORTA.
[ct=1913.721] >> Kirk: AND THEY LOVE
[ct=1916.107] THESE ROUTES OVER THE
[ct=1916.362] MIDDLE OF THE DEFENSE.
[ct=1918.367] TRY TO PICK ON THOSE
[ct=1920.410] LINE BACKERS, PUT THEM
[ct=1923.310] IN CONFLICT.
[ct=1924.672] THAT TIME IT WAS QUAY
[ct=1926.046] WALKER.
[ct=1926.309] HE CAME OFF A BIT
[ct=1927.671] LATE, AND GOFF WAS
[ct=1928.866] ABLE TO SQUEEZE IT IN
[ct=1931.613] THERE FOR A NICE GAIN.
[ct=1931.946] >> Al: SEVEN FIRST
[ct=1933.762] DOWNS FOR THE LIONS.
[ct=1937.860] ONLY ONE FOR GREEN
[ct=1937.860] BAY.
[ct=1942.030] MONTGOMERY SCORED THE
[ct=1945.029] TO THE 39 YARD LINE.
[ct=1946.456] A LITTLE EXTRA ACTION
[ct=1946.988] AFTER THE PLAY.
[ct=1948.148] YOU SEE THE FLAG
[ct=1948.833] COMING IN.
[ct=1950.723] YOU GOT QUAY WALKER
[ct=1951.787] INVOLVED AND DAN
[ct=1956.868] >> Kirk: YEAH, THAT’S
[ct=1958.221] AN EASY CALL,
[ct=1959.662] RIVALRY.
[ct=1960.523] IT’S GOING TO GET A
[ct=1961.509] LITTLE HEATED.
[ct=1962.765] AND THAT TIME QUAY
[ct=1964.074] WALKER LOST HIS COOL.
[ct=1964.821] AFTER HE GOT PUSHED
[ct=1966.171] NEAR THE END NEAR THE
[ct=1968.242] END OF THE WHISTLE.
[ct=1968.667] >> Al: AFTER THE PLAY
[ct=1970.217] WAS OVER, PERSONAL
[ct=1972.459] FOUL.
[ct=1973.087] UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS
[ct=1974.377] DEFENSE NUMBER 7.
[ct=1977.047] 15 YARD PENALTY WILL
[ct=1978.775] BE ENFORCED.
[ct=1981.560] >> Kirk: AL, HERE’S 70
[ct=1982.870] SKIPPER FINISHING THE
[ct=1984.908] PLAY RIGHT HERE.
[ct=1985.294] WALKER DOESN’T LIKE
[ct=1987.091] IT, AND THEN HE HITS
[ct=1988.202] HIM, AND THE BIG FELLA
[ct=1988.967] GOES DOWN.
[ct=1991.272] THAT’S A BIG MAN GOING
[ct=1996.755] AT 6’9", 330, LOOKS
[ct=1997.519] LIKE A BIG TIME
[ct=1999.987] WRESTLER OUT THERE.
[ct=1999.987] >> Al: HE DOES.
[ct=2001.233] I THINK IT’S THE
[ct=2002.411] FOURTH STINT HE’S HAD
[ct=2003.123] WITH THE LIONS.
[ct=2004.447] HE’S BEEN ALL OVER THE
[ct=2005.301] LEAGUE.
[ct=2006.426] >> Kirk: BOUNCES NOT
[ct=2006.883] ONLY ALL OVER THE
[ct=2013.306] LEAGUE AND LIONS BUT
[ct=2013.752] OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=2016.766] >> Al: FILLING IN
[ct=2020.353] TONIGHT FOR TAYLOR
[ct=2021.730] DECKER.
[ct=2022.037] GOOD ON THE COVERAGE
[ct=2023.571] THAT TIME AS McDUFFIE
[ct=2024.700] PUT THE PRESSURE ON.
[ct=2027.784] >> Kirk: HOW ABOUT
[ct=2028.653] DAVID MONTGOMERY JUST
[ct=2031.526] IN TIME.
[ct=2032.762] WHEN McDUFFIE COMES IN
[ct=2033.856] THE BLITZES, HE’S
[ct=2036.827] COMING IN FAST.
[ct=2037.478] THIS TIME MONTGOMERY
[ct=2038.256] LEARNED BECAUSE HE WAS
[ct=2040.806] IN BEFORE, HE SOLD
[ct=2041.053] OUT.
[ct=2041.850] GIVE McDUFFIE CREDIT
[ct=2042.568] BECAUSE HE KEPT
[ct=2045.199] FIGHTING THROUGH IT.
[ct=2045.199] BOY, MONTGOMERY
[ct=2046.089] STEPPED RIGHT INTO
[ct=2050.529] THAT BLITZ FROM 58.
[ct=2051.961] >> Al: GIBBS IS THE
[ct=2054.684] GIVE IT TO HIM.
[ct=2056.813] NOTHING DOING.
[ct=2057.132] SMOTHERED AT THE LINE
[ct=2068.200] DEVONTE WYATT IS
[ct=2073.956] >> Kirk: WYATT IS AN
[ct=2078.251] UNAPPRECIATED PLAYER.
[ct=2078.598] KIND OF A FORGOTTEN
[ct=2078.978] GUY.
[ct=2080.983] HAD A KNEE IN ’23, HAD
[ct=2081.865] AN ANKLE THROUGHOUT
[ct=2082.664] HIS CAREER.
[ct=2083.770] THERE’S VAN NESS
[ct=2084.654] RUNNING OFF INTO THE
[ct=2085.375] LOCKER ROOM.
[ct=2086.741] I’LL TELL YOU NOW THAT
[ct=2087.862] HE’S HEALTHY DON’T BE
[ct=2091.630] SURPRISED TO SEE 95
[ct=2093.177] AND WYATT MAKE MORE
[ct=2094.727] PLAYS.
[ct=2097.508] >> Al: 3rd AND 10.
[ct=2098.837] THROWING.
[ct=2100.776] CROWD WANTS A FLAG.
[ct=2102.618] WILL NOT GET ONE.
[ct=2105.267] IT’LL BE 4th DOWN AND
[ct=2107.608] AND IN COMES THE FIELD
[ct=2108.694] GOAL GROUP TO MAKE IT
[ct=2110.505] 10-0.
[ct=2112.862] >> Kirk: THAT TIME
[ct=2114.518] GOFF AS EXPERIENCED AS
[ct=2116.545] HE IS, BLITS, DROPPED
[ct=2118.664] AT THE LAST SECOND,
[ct=2120.131] DEFENSIVE END.
[ct=2121.589] MOSBY EFFECTS THAT,
[ct=2122.456] AND JAMESON WILLIAMS,
[ct=2123.469] HE DIDN’T KNOW IT WAS
[ct=2125.119] MANNED OR ZONED, AND
[ct=2126.860] HE STOPPED AND DIDN’T
[ct=2129.062] KNOW IF THEY WOULD
[ct=2131.413] KEEP GOING AND MISSED.
[ct=2131.957] ONLY MISSED LAST WEEK
[ct=2132.260] FROM 45.
[ct=2134.185] THIS IS FROM 43.
[ct=2135.749] JACK FOX TO PUT IT
[ct=2139.000] AND THE KICK IS GOOD.
[ct=2142.066] 2 MINUTES INTO THE
[ct=2142.903] SECOND QUARTER, AND
[ct=2145.891] THE GAME OF THE WEEK >> Kirk: YE
[ct=2147.326] YOUNG QUARTERBACK YOU
[ct=2147.777] CAN IMAGINE HOW MUCH
[ct=2148.716] HE HAD A CHANCE TO
[ct=2149.944] LEARN FROM WHIT AT
[ct=2150.518] THAT STAGE OF HIS
[ct=2153.225] >> Al: ABSOLUTELY.
[ct=2153.509] >> Kirk: LEARNED FROM
[ct=2155.817] THE BEST.
[ct=2156.049] >> Al: YEP.
[ct=2157.518] TO KICK OFF.0
[ct=2159.743] THE PACKERS HAVE ONLY
[ct=2162.781] 37 YARDS ON TEN PLAYS.
[ct=2163.592] THEY’RE ONLY FIRST
[ct=2164.671] DOWN BY WAY OF
[ct=2166.046] PENALTY.
[ct=2166.576] CAN THEY GET SOMETHING
[ct=2167.493] GOING?
[ct=2169.453] THEY START HERE ON THE
[ct=2171.577] GROUND.
[ct=2171.868] 4-YARD GAIN HERE FOR
[ct=2173.442] JACOBS, TACKLED BY
[ct=2176.894] >> Kirk: YEAH, I THINK
[ct=2178.285] YOU’LL SEE THEM GOING
[ct=2178.926] AND MORE BACK TO THE
[ct=2180.717] RUNNING GAME FOR JOSH
[ct=2182.347] THE REASON IS HE’S
[ct=2183.499] DONE A GOOD JOB
[ct=2184.417] CREATING PRESSURE.
[ct=2185.487] HAS 13 PLAYERS ON THE
[ct=2188.093] DEFENSE ALONE ON IR,
[ct=2188.921] THREE MORE DOWN
[ct=2191.114] A LOT OF NEW FACES.
[ct=2191.672] THERE’S MUHAMMAD
[ct=2192.756] GETTING THE INVOLVE,
[ct=2194.345] PAT O’CONNOR, A LOT OF
[ct=2194.881] DEFENSE FACES.
[ct=2195.529] THERE’S MAYBE THE
[ct=2196.673] DEFENSIVE ASSISTANT
[ct=2197.349] COACH, COORDINATOR
[ct=2199.178] MAYBE, AND THE ENTIRE
[ct=2199.832] NFL WITH WHAT HE HAS
[ct=2201.621] FACED, AARON GLENN,
[ct=2202.914] DOING A GREAT JOB SO
[ct=2204.133] FAR TONIGHT.
[ct=2205.579] >> Al: WORKING WITH
[ct=2206.609] PACE.
[ct=2207.602] NICE HOLE OVER THE
[ct=2209.150] RIGHT SLIDE, AND THERE
[ct=2209.760] HE GOES FOR A FIRST
[ct=2211.227] DOWN AND MORE IS JOSH
[ct=2213.318] YOU KNOW, THE ONE
[ct=2215.812] THING ABOUT JACOBS AND
[ct=2221.120] BARKLEY AND HENRY AND
[ct=2222.486] MIXEN, THIR OGOING TO
[ct=2223.111] START MAKING THE
[ct=2224.377] RUNNING BACKS NOT
[ct=2225.583] UNDERVALUED ANYMORE.
[ct=2226.611] >> Kirk: I AGREE WITH
[ct=2227.712] THAT’S BECOME A BIG
[ct=2229.381] STORY THIS YEAR, AND I
[ct=2230.122] THINK IT SHOULD BE.
[ct=2231.828] IT’S BEEN FANTASTIC,
[ct=2232.920] AND THIS IS WHAT HE
[ct=2235.469] BRINGS TO THE OFFENSE.
[ct=2235.935] THIS IS AN OFFENSE
[ct=2236.452] BUILT ON THE RUN GAME
[ct=2237.189] FIRST.
[ct=2238.392] THEY’VE GOT TO GET HIM
[ct=2239.991] GOING.
[ct=2240.632] THAT’S WHAT HE CAN DO
[ct=2241.715] RUNNING THROUGH THE
[ct=2243.555] ARM TACKLES, HE GETS
[ct=2245.153] GOING AND THEN YOU’LL
[ct=2246.593] SEE MATT LaFLEUR
[ct=2248.178] DIAL-UP THE
[ct=2251.103] PLAY-ACTION PASS
[ct=2254.406] OPPORTUNITY LATER.
[ct=2255.406] >> Al: TAKING THAT ONE
[ct=2256.864] TO THE 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=2258.283] GAIN OF 7, MUHAMMAD
[ct=2259.865] MAKING THE STOP THERE.
[ct=2261.511] IT’LL BE 2nd AND 3.
[ct=2262.211] >> Kirk: WITHOUT
[ct=2264.580] HAVING AN A.J. DYLAN
[ct=2264.862] TYPE OF HAMMER BACK
[ct=2266.239] THERE, IT’S NICE TO
[ct=2267.938] SEE BROOKS AND WILSON
[ct=2269.008] PROVIDING A LITTLE
[ct=2269.735] DEPTH IN THAT
[ct=2272.305] BACKFIELD SPOT.
[ct=2273.703] JOSH JACOBS, GIVE HIM
[ct=2274.845] CREDIT, HE HAS BEEN A
[ct=2276.124] WORKHORSE.
[ct=2277.047] SEVEN GAMES HE’S GONE
[ct=2278.038] OVER 18 CARRIES, LET
[ct=2279.918] ALONE GETS INVOLVED IN
[ct=2280.791] CATCHING THE BALL IN
[ct=2283.058] THE BACKFIELD, TOO.
[ct=2283.469] WILSON AND BROOKS THE
[ct=2284.493] LONGER YOU GET INTO
[ct=2285.353] DECEMBER AND JANUARY,
[ct=2286.442] YOU’RE GOING TO NEED
[ct=2287.487] JOSH JACOBS HEALTHY,
[ct=2288.465] SO IT’S GOOD THEY’RE
[ct=2289.333] GOING TO STEP IN
[ct=2291.187] >> Al: WILSON AND
[ct=2292.217] BROOKS ARE BOTH IN THE
[ct=2293.148] BACKFIELD.
[ct=2295.020] NOW WILSON IN MOTION,
[ct=2298.113] GIVE IT TO BROOKS, AND
[ct=2298.745] HE’S FIGHTING FOR A
[ct=2301.520] MAY HAVE PICKED IT UP.
[ct=2302.021] THEY’RE GOING TO MARK
[ct=2302.773] IT AT ABOUT THE 37
[ct=2305.149] RIPPING AT THAT BALL
[ct=2305.937] TRYING TO GET IT OUT
[ct=2307.447] OF THERE.
[ct=2308.231] >> Al: FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2311.511] HEATING UP JACOBS
[ct=2313.472] THROUGH WEEK 13.
[ct=2314.074] 987, HE’S OVER 1,000
[ct=2315.304] YARDS WITH HIS EFFORT
[ct=2316.290] HERE TONIGHT.
[ct=2317.191] HE’S ALREADY GAINED 36
[ct=2319.640] YOU GO BACK TO
[ct=2328.066] BROCKINGTON AND AMAN
[ct=2329.508] GREEN WHO FINISHED IN
[ct=2330.922] PASS RUSH.
[ct=2331.185] PRETTY GOOD COMPANY
[ct=2332.837] JACOBS IS BACK IN THE
[ct=2334.616] BALL AT THE 37 YARD
[ct=2339.489] AND LOOK OUT.
[ct=2342.368] AND WHO MOVED FIRST?
[ct=2345.170] JOSH MYERS SNAPPING
[ct=2346.569] >> Kirk: I DIDN’T SEE
[ct=2349.061] A FLINCH.
[ct=2349.706] IT’S GOOD THEY MIXED
[ct=2351.259] IN A HARD COUNT ON
[ct=2353.068] O’CONNOR BECAUSE HE
[ct=2353.418] HAS BEEN GETTING OFF
[ct=2354.911] THE BALL SO QUICKLY,
[ct=2355.953] HE’S MAKING IT TOUGH
[ct=2358.978] ON MYERS AND JENKINS
[ct=2358.978] TO GUARD.
[ct=2359.690] AND I DON’T KNOW IF
[ct=2361.526] HE’S UP THERE, HAS
[ct=2365.071] SOME KIND OF TAIL OR
[ct=2365.311] SOME KIND OF CUE
[ct=2366.420] THAT’S GETTING HIM OFF
[ct=2368.824] THE BALL, BUT GOOD JOB
[ct=2370.021] BY GREEN BAY.
[ct=2371.517] MAYBE THAT’LL SLOW HIM
[ct=2374.168] DOWN A LITTLE BIT.
[ct=2375.443] >> Al: 5-YARD PENALTY.
[ct=2377.533] 1st AND 5 AT THE 32.
[ct=2381.639] STOPPED AT THE LINE OF
[ct=2386.801] JACOBS GOING NOWHERE.
[ct=2388.260] JACK CAMPBELL’S SECOND
[ct=2389.741] YEAR OUT OF IOWA
[ct=2391.139] MAKING THE TACKLE.
[ct=2391.698] >> Kirk: AGAIN, THE
[ct=2393.311] PERSONALITY, THE
[ct=2396.889] CULTURE OF DAN CONNER
[ct=2398.065] TEAMS, WATCH YOU’LL
[ct=2399.482] SEE MAN GO IN MOTION
[ct=2400.325] WHO’S A BIG MAN IN
[ct=2401.667] TUCKER KRAFT.
[ct=2403.719] WATCH 85, WATCH THIS.
[ct=2404.319] BANG, LOOK AT THAT
[ct=2408.508] MESSAGE BEING SENT.
[ct=2411.072] THAT’S TREVOR WHO HITS
[ct=2412.868] HIM THERE, AND KRAFT’S
[ct=2413.796] GOING TO THINK TWICE
[ct=2414.303] BEFORE HE COMES IN
[ct=2416.277] MOTION TO BLOCK 53.
[ct=2418.395] WHAT A PLAY.
[ct=2421.569] >> Al: 2nd AND 3.
[ct=2423.557] TO THE 24 YARD LINE,
[ct=2425.496] SO GREEN BAY ON THE
[ct=2426.736] MOVE, DRIVE STARTED
[ct=2428.249] BACK AT THEIR 30 YARD
[ct=2431.525] THEY RUN SIX PLAYS FOR
[ct=2433.234] 46 YARDS HERE.
[ct=2434.347] ALL RUNS, TOO.
[ct=2435.940] >> Kirk: YEAH, BEING
[ct=2439.862] VERY PATIENT HERE.
[ct=2445.369] LOOKS LIKE SEAN RHYAN
[ct=2447.322] NEEDS SOME HELP OFF.
[ct=2448.515] >> Al: RHYAN THE RIGHT
[ct=2448.968] GUARD.
[ct=2449.804] COMING UP FOR AT LEAST
[ct=2450.887] ONE PLAY.
[ct=2451.318] >> Kirk: HE WAS THE
[ct=2454.390] POLAR THERE.
[ct=2457.091] HE HITS KWON ALEXANDER
[ct=2457.424] NUMBER 10.
[ct=2458.586] FROM THE BOTTOM YOU’LL
[ct=2460.593] SEE HIM WORK UP AND
[ct=2461.444] KWON ALEXANDER HITS
[ct=2462.687] I THINK THAT COLLISION
[ct=2463.576] MAYBE STUNNED MIM.
[ct=2464.198] HE’S GOING TO GO TO
[ct=2466.354] THE SIDELINE AND
[ct=2467.777] HOPEFULLY COME BACK.
[ct=2469.152] >> Al: YEAH, THAT’S
[ct=2471.053] KADEEM TELFORT COMES
[ct=2474.560] INTO HIS SPOT.
[ct=2475.948] FIRST DOWN AT THE 24
[ct=2478.404] LEFT SIDE.
[ct=2480.106] HARD YARD FLAG THROWN,
[ct=2485.031] THAT’S JACOBS FOR ONE.
[ct=2485.352] >> Kirk: THIS IS WHY
[ct=2486.393] YOU SEE DEFENSES PLAY
[ct=2487.189] SOME COVERAGE.
[ct=2488.669] THEY WANT TEAMS TO
[ct=2490.949] HAVE TO DRIVE THE BALL
[ct=2490.949] WITHOUT MAKING
[ct=2493.482] MISTAKES, AND GREEN
[ct=2494.044] BAY HAD BEEN DOING IT
[ct=2495.585] UNTIL THIS HOLDING
[ct=2495.888] CALL.
[ct=2497.049] DON’T GIVE UP THE
[ct=2498.387] EXPLOSIVE.
[ct=2499.051] MAKE THEM HAVE TO
[ct=2499.910] DRIVE WITHOUT MAKING
[ct=2502.858] MISTAKES.
[ct=2505.576] OFFENSE NUMBER 74.
[ct=2508.878] >> Al: SO THAT’S THE
[ct=2513.872] LEFT YARD.
[ct=2516.648] THAT’S ELTON JENKINS.
[ct=2518.375] 1st AND 20 NOW.
[ct=2519.833] OVER HERE ON THE LEFT.
[ct=2521.942] CAN SEE THAT LEFT HAND
[ct=2522.364] GRABBING ONTO THE
[ct=2526.254] JERSEY.
[ct=2527.640] >> Al: SO BACK TO THE
[ct=2530.648] 35 YARD LINE AGAIN.
[ct=2533.076] LOVE IS 2 OUT OF 5 FOR
[ct=2535.460] 23 YARDS AND HAS NOT
[ct=2536.649] THROWN A PASS ON THIS
[ct=2537.461] DRIVE.
[ct=2538.311] >> Kirk: AND REMEMBER,
[ct=2539.291] AL, WHEN HE’S DROPPED
[ct=2540.400] BACK, THEY HAVE
[ct=2542.000] BROUGHT PRESSURE, AND
[ct=2543.207] IT’S EFFECTED HIM AND
[ct=2544.921] THE OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=2545.616] >> Al: MAJOR.
[ct=2546.630] BUT THIS TIME HE HAS
[ct=2548.255] TIME, AND HE’S ABLE TO
[ct=2549.148] COMPLETE THE PASS TO
[ct=2550.029] THE 28 YARD LINE.
[ct=2552.748] THAT’S TUCKER KRAFT,
[ct=2554.641] TACKLED BY BRANCH.
[ct=2556.376] LUKE MUSGRAVE WOULD
[ct=2559.127] HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER
[ct=2559.127] ONE TIGHT END, BUT
[ct=2560.169] HE’S GIVEN KRAFT THE
[ct=2560.964] OPPORTUNITY TO SHINE
[ct=2562.076] THIS YEAR, AND HE HAS
[ct=2564.719] GIVEN SIX TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=2564.987] >> Kirk: THERE’S THE
[ct=2566.238] ROOKIE SAFETY OUT OF
[ct=2567.051] OREGON WHO’S HAD A BIG
[ct=2569.474] IMPACT ON HIS TEAM.
[ct=2572.373] JEFF HAFLEY TELLING US
[ct=2572.833] THIS WEEK HOW
[ct=2573.072] IMPRESSED HE’S BEEN
[ct=2574.665] WITH THE WAY HE’S BEEN
[ct=2577.284] ABLE TO ICPICK THINGS
[ct=2577.999] UP.
[ct=2579.517] MATT LaFLEUR AND THE
[ct=2581.485] PACKERS POTENTIALLY
[ct=2585.566] LOSE THEIR SAFETY.
[ct=2589.317] >> Al: 2nd AND 12.
[ct=2591.042] LOVE, STEPPING UP.
[ct=2592.687] STEPPING OUT.
[ct=2593.391] LOOKS TO THE FIRST
[ct=2597.352] DOWN AND GETS IT.
[ct=2599.283] SO FROM THE 1st AND 20
[ct=2600.055] TO ANOTHER FIRST DOWN
[ct=2601.356] AS THEY TAKE IT TO THE
[ct=2604.239] >> Kirk: MUHAMMAD
[ct=2605.499] GIBSON SOME PRESSURE
[ct=2606.280] OVER FOR HIS RIGHT,
[ct=2607.298] BUT THIS OPENS UP
[ct=2608.239] NICELY.
[ct=2608.632] REMEMBER YOU TOUCHED
[ct=2609.060] ON SOME OF THE
[ct=2610.034] INJURIES HE DEALT WITH
[ct=2612.549] EARLY DOWN IN BRAZIL
[ct=2613.267] IN THE GROIN THAT
[ct=2613.773] SLOWED HIM DOWN.
[ct=2614.652] THIS IS WHAT HE CAN
[ct=2615.679] BRING TO THE TABLE
[ct=2617.684] WHEN HE’S HEALTHY.
[ct=2618.713] WAVE SEEN HIM BECOME
[ct=2619.994] THIS KIND OF GUY THE
[ct=2622.338] LAST THREE WEEKS, AND
[ct=2623.257] THIS HAS BEEN MISSING
[ct=2623.912] THIS GREEN BAY
[ct=2624.530] OFFENSE.
[ct=2624.986] WHEN EVERYTHING’S
[ct=2626.721] COVERED AND YOU PLAY
[ct=2628.079] MANNED COVERAGE, YOU
[ct=2628.795] BETTER ACCOUNT FOR
[ct=2631.611] NUMBER 10 OR HE’S
[ct=2631.976] GOING TO TAKE OFF.
[ct=2632.324] >> Al: HIS LONGEST RUN
[ct=2635.326] OF THE YEAR, 14 YARDS.
[ct=2640.344] BACK TO THE GROUND.
[ct=2641.923] TURNER.
[ct=2643.815] AND A PENALTY.
[ct=2644.151] >> Kirk: THESE LINE
[ct=2645.810] BACKERS ARE PLAYING.
[ct=2648.097] THEY’RE ADJUSTING TO
[ct=2649.446] THE MOTION, GETTING
[ct=2649.798] DOWNHILL.
[ct=2653.704] THIS PENALTY MAY BE ON
[ct=2669.728] >> Referee: ILLEGAL
[ct=2670.003] USE OF THE HANDS,
[ct=2670.989] HANDS TO THE FACE,
[ct=2673.922] DEFENSE NUMBER 99.
[ct=2675.974] 5-YARD PENALTY WILL BE
[ct=2677.301] ADDED INTO THE RUN.
[ct=2680.505] >> Al: SO Za’DARIUS
[ct=2680.839] SMITH.
[ct=2681.606] WHEN THEY LOST
[ct=2682.337] HUTCHINSON, THEY
[ct=2683.694] PICKED UP SMITH.
[ct=2684.756] HAS DONE A GREAT JOB
[ct=2686.198] THE FRONT OFFICE HAS
[ct=2687.247] BRINGING GUYS IN OFF
[ct=2688.483] THE STREET, TAKING
[ct=2689.159] TRADES FOR GUYS.
[ct=2690.645] >> Kirk: GETS HIS HAND
[ct=2691.361] UNDERNEATH, YOU CAN
[ct=2695.884] SEE ON THE NECK THERE.
[ct=2698.310] SO THEY GET 5 YARDS.
[ct=2702.512] STILL FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2706.930] >> Al: EIGHT RUNS, ONE
[ct=2707.296] PASS.
[ct=2713.541] LOOKING FOR ROOM.
[ct=2715.131] THREADING HIS WAY.
[ct=2716.050] NICE MOVE.
[ct=2719.210] TO ABOUT THE 1 1/2
[ct=2720.715] GOES JOSH JACOBS, 2nd
[ct=2721.941] DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=2724.486] AL.
[ct=2725.813] THAT LITTLE HESITATION
[ct=2727.551] ALLOWED JOSH MYERS TO
[ct=2728.879] BE ABLE TO STAY ON HIS
[ct=2729.654] BLOCK AND GOT HIM TO
[ct=2730.783] BE ABLE TO WIGGLE
[ct=2731.455] THROUGH FOR MORE
[ct=2733.285] THIS PLAY POTENTIALLY
[ct=2733.831] BLOWN UP.
[ct=2735.046] WATCH THE CENTER, 71,
[ct=2736.564] A LITTLE HESITATION.
[ct=2736.994] GETS UNDERNEATH THAT,
[ct=2739.796] AND AGAIN, HE’S ABLE
[ct=2739.796] TO SHAKE THROUGH.
[ct=2740.164] HE’S ONE OF THE BEST
[ct=2741.980] BACKS IN THE NFL WITH
[ct=2742.624] YARDS AFTER CONTACT.
[ct=2744.156] IN FACT, HE’S THIRD IN
[ct=2745.687] THE LEAGUE, AND THAT
[ct=2746.612] TIME GOOD JOB OF
[ct=2747.889] SHOWING HIS VISION TO
[ct=2749.557] BE ABLE TO GET SOME
[ct=2752.374] POSITIVE YARDS.
[ct=2752.806] >> Al: 6 MINUTES TO
[ct=2754.668] HALF TIME.
[ct=2756.511] 2nd AND GOAL.
[ct=2763.061] JACOBS AGAIN.
[ct=2763.814] A FAKE TO HIM, AND
[ct=2765.144] THEN TUCKER KRAFT WAS
[ct=2766.218] THE INTENDED RECEIVER.
[ct=2767.291] IT’S INCOMPLETE.
[ct=2771.139] >> Kirk: WHAT A CALL.
[ct=2774.152] DEFENSE HAS THEIR EYES
[ct=2775.582] IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=2776.879] THEIR LOCKED IN ON
[ct=2777.809] JOSH JAKINGS.
[ct=2781.965] AND SEE THE EYES OF
[ct=2783.367] 32, BRANCH, HE JUST
[ct=2785.123] NEEDED TO PUT A LITTLE
[ct=2787.261] AIR UNDER THIS AND
[ct=2788.039] FLOAT IT OUT THERE AND
[ct=2790.109] AN EASY TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=2793.077] MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR
[ct=2793.646] THE PACKERS ON THAT
[ct=2808.162] LOVE, UNDER PRESSURE.
[ct=2808.822] AND THAT’S A FLAG IN
[ct=2810.864] THE END ZONE.
[ct=2812.858] FOR THE MOMENT IT’S
[ct=2814.232] TAKEN BY DAVIS, BUT
[ct=2814.868] LET’S SEE ABOUT THE
[ct=2820.443] CALL IN THE END ZONE.
[ct=2821.074] SO FOR THE MOMENT THE
[ct=2822.264] LIONS THINK THEY HAVE
[ct=2825.821] IT, BUT YOU LOOK AT
[ct=2826.792] ARN LDS EXPRESSION,
[ct=2829.096] AND THAT MAY TELL
[ct=2831.837] YOU -- SPEAK VOLUMES
[ct=2832.271] ANYWAY.
[ct=2833.918] WE’LL SEE.
[ct=2835.725] CAMPBELL WANTS TO
[ct=2836.170] KNOW.
[ct=2838.353] SO DO WE.
[ct=2839.210] >> Kirk: YEAH, THEY
[ct=2842.083] GOT THE ROOKIE TERRION
[ct=2843.723] ARNOLD MAN-TO-MAN
[ct=2844.941] AGAINST WATSON ON THAT
[ct=2847.732] BACK LINE.
[ct=2848.719] IT LOOKED LIKE WATSON
[ct=2849.498] WAS TRYING TO WORK
[ct=2852.162] BACK TO HIS
[ct=2854.101] QUARTERBACK TO OUR
[ct=2856.924] LEFT.
[ct=2857.764] >> Al: YEAH, ARNOLD
[ct=2858.373] WAS ALREADY PLEADING
[ct=2861.004] HIS CASE BEFORE DAVIS
[ct=2863.737] PICKED UP THE BALL.
[ct=2865.498] SO WITH 5:30 TO GO,
[ct=2868.271] PENALIZED FOR PASS
[ct=2869.793] 17 TIMES.
[ct=2870.643] A COUPLE OF TIMES
[ct=2871.482] THAT’S THE MOST IN THE
[ct=2873.111] AND THAT’S THE THIRD
[ct=2874.820] FIRST DOWN FOR GREEN
[ct=2875.251] BAY TONIGHT BY
[ct=2877.915] TWO ON THIS DRIVE.
[ct=2887.409] CAN THEY GET IT INTO
[ct=2888.030] THE END ZONE?
[ct=2889.512] YES, HE CAN.
[ct=2889.868] JACOBS WITH A
[ct=2893.597] NOT THE PRETTIEST
[ct=2894.026] DRIVE WE’VE EVER SEEN.
[ct=2894.670] >> Kirk: NO.
[ct=2896.364] NO.
[ct=2896.364] >> Al: BUT VERY
[ct=2897.733] EFFECTIVE.
[ct=2899.598] 10 RUNS, 2 PASSES.
[ct=2900.483] YOU DON’T SEE THAT
[ct=2902.178] VERY OFTEN ON A TWO
[ct=2902.963] PLAY DRIVE.
[ct=2904.494] >> Kirk: THIS DRIVE
[ct=2907.001] AVERAGE 6 1/2 YARDS
[ct=2909.025] PER CARRY, THEY TURNED
[ct=2910.727] IT OVER AFTER GETTING
[ct=2910.727] DOWN 10.
[ct=2911.449] THEY DIDN’T PANIC,
[ct=2912.899] TURNED IT OVER ON THE
[ct=2913.370] OFFENSIVE LINE AND
[ct=2915.094] TURNED IT OFF OVER TO
[ct=2915.741] THE GUY THAT’S BEEN
[ct=2918.268] CARRYING THEM IN THAT
[ct=2922.342] BACKFIELD, SKBRAUGS
[ct=2924.271] AND PAID OFF WITH THAT
[ct=2927.419] >> Al: FOR THE MOMENT
[ct=2928.487] HAS SOLVED GREEN BAY’S
[ct=2930.763] KICKING PROBLEMS.
[ct=2933.123] LONG-TIME DENVER
[ct=2938.408] THAT ONE THROUGH.
[ct=2939.658] AND WITH 5:30 TO GO IN
[ct=2942.088] THE HALF, IT’S DETROIT
[ct=2943.624] 10, GREEN BAY 7.
[ct=2946.598] 31-8, 70 TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=2947.455] THAT EQUALS KANSAS
[ct=2948.396] CITY FOR THE BEST MARK
[ct=2948.907] IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=2950.034] IT ALL GOT TURNED
[ct=2952.272] AND FOR JARED GOFF, A
[ct=2954.659] GUY WHO, YOU KNOW,
[ct=2955.161] CERTAINLY HAD HIS
[ct=2955.472] CONFIDENCE SHOOK WHEN
[ct=2957.225] HE GOT TRADED FOR
[ct=2958.760] MATTHEW STAFFORD, OF
[ct=2959.100] COURSE THAT WORKED OUT
[ct=2959.953] VERY WELL FOR THE
[ct=2962.320] RAMS, BUT IS NOW
[ct=2962.657] WORKING OUT EXTREMELY
[ct=2965.913] WELL FOR THE LIONS.
[ct=2966.571] SO BOTH TEAMS ARE
[ct=2970.522] GOING TO WIND UP WITH
[ct=2971.210] WHAT THEY WANTED.
[ct=2974.058] HAPPENED WITH STAFFORD
[ct=2975.076] AND THE RAMS,
[ct=2979.292] INTENSIFIED THE TRADE
[ct=2980.184] AND ALMOST THE MOCKING
[ct=2981.839] SORT OF THE REACTION
[ct=2982.226] TO GOFF.
[ct=2982.950] I THINK THAT’S HOW HE
[ct=2984.108] TOOK IT.
[ct=2984.794] HE GETS HERE, GET OFF
[ct=2986.069] TO A SLOW START WITH
[ct=2987.242] HIM, THINGS AREN’T
[ct=2988.371] GOING WELL.
[ct=2989.590] MEANWHILE THE RAMS ARE
[ct=2992.135] THE BELL OF THE BALL.
[ct=2994.216] EVERYBODY IS TALKING
[ct=3002.449] ABOUT SEAN McVEIGH AND
[ct=3004.405] MATTHEW STAFFORD.
[ct=3007.538] >> Al: THE RAMS WENT
[ct=3009.902] ALL IN ’21.
[ct=3011.814] THEY PULLED IT OFF.
[ct=3018.669] A 9 YARD GAIN HERE FOR
[ct=3026.634] DERRICK.
[ct=3027.178] SEAN McVAY IS DOWN
[ct=3028.812] THERE IN CABO, MATTHEW
[ct=3030.363] STAFFORD IS THERE.
[ct=3031.790] THEY GET DEAL.
[ct=3032.782] >> Kirk: IT WORKED OUT
[ct=3034.018] FOR GOFF.
[ct=3034.943] THERE’S HIS FAMILY,
[ct=3035.516] HIS DAD.
[ct=3037.597] AND IT’S A TEAM I
[ct=3038.536] THINK FEELS THEY HAVE
[ct=3039.679] WHAT IT TAKES.
[ct=3040.483] THEY BUILT AROUND HIM
[ct=3042.185] BEAUTIFULLY.
[ct=3042.460] OFFENSIVE LINE, THE
[ct=3043.291] TWO BACKS, GREAT
[ct=3044.554] SKILL.
[ct=3045.386] IT’S ALL WORKING OUT
[ct=3050.291] FOR 16.
[ct=3050.645] >> Al: THAT PASS IS
[ct=3050.946] CAUGHT AT THE 45 YARD
[ct=3051.572] ON THE MOVE AGAIN IT’S
[ct=3053.576] MAKING THAT CATCH
[ct=3055.467] QUICKLY.
[ct=3057.711] THIS ONE?
[ct=3058.096] A SAFETY PLAYING
[ct=3059.931] CENTER FIELD IN XAVIER
[ct=3061.514] McKINNEY.
[ct=3065.277] YOU’VE GOT TO PUT THIS
[ct=3069.134] DOWN ON A LINE.
[ct=3072.538] >> Al: 20-YARD GAIN.
[ct=3073.259] SHOOTS IT OFF TO THE
[ct=3073.259] SIDE.
[ct=3075.367] MONTGOMERY PICKS UP
[ct=3075.681] ABOUT 6.
[ct=3077.320] WE GO TO KAYLEE.
[ct=3079.584] >> GUYS, PACKERS
[ct=3081.472] DEFENSE LINEMAN LUCAS
[ct=3084.025] VAN NESS LEFT THE
[ct=3085.115] FIELD EARLY AND WE
[ct=3085.759] DIDN’T KNOW WHY.
[ct=3086.759] TURNS OUT HE INJURED
[ct=3088.703] HIS RIGHT THUMB.
[ct=3089.081] HE’S COME BACK TO THE
[ct=3091.330] SIDELINES, TALKED WITH
[ct=3092.914] THE ATHLETIC TRAINER
[ct=3097.307] AND HAS A VERY STRONG
[ct=3102.244] TAPE JOB ON HIS LEFT.
[ct=3103.087] >> Al: 2nd DOWN AND 5
[ct=3104.330] NOW FOR DETROIT.
[ct=3105.630] FROM THE 37.
[ct=3108.901] CHANGING THE PLAY AT
[ct=3110.776] THE LINE.
[ct=3111.587] AND THEN LOST ONE AND
[ct=3116.089] JAMESON WILLIAMS, AND
[ct=3118.320] VALENTINE COVERING ON
[ct=3120.359] MAYBE NOT ON THE SAME
[ct=3120.825] PAGE.
[ct=3121.946] 3rd AND 5.
[ct=3123.516] CONTINUES DIALING UP
[ct=3126.219] SOME PRESSURE.
[ct=3126.937] KAYLEE JUST MENTIONED
[ct=3130.336] THE ROOKIE IS OUT.
[ct=3131.039] AND ANDERSON THE
[ct=3132.508] SECOND YEAR OUT OF BYU
[ct=3133.624] IS IN.
[ct=3134.532] TURNED HIM LOOSE ON A
[ct=3136.015] BLITZ, AND ONCE AGAIN
[ct=3137.215] DAVID MONTGOMERY RIGHT
[ct=3138.133] WHERE HE NEEDS TO BE
[ct=3139.240] TO PICK THAT BLITZ UP
[ct=3141.149] TO GIVE GOFF THE TIME.
[ct=3142.048] JUST NOT ABLE TO MAKE
[ct=3143.281] THIS THROW.
[ct=3144.560] LET’S SEE WHO HE DIALS
[ct=3145.415] UP HERE ON THIS THIRD
[ct=3146.867] >> Al: THREE TIGHT
[ct=3148.580] ENDS IN THIS SET.
[ct=3149.581] GOFF STEPS AWAY FROM
[ct=3150.612] PRESSURE, THROWS,
[ct=3151.281] CAUGHT.
[ct=3155.072] MONTGOMERY GOT ALMOST
[ct=3156.057] SACKED, TOOK A STEP
[ct=3158.677] FORWARD.
[ct=3159.071] WILSON IS THERE.
[ct=3160.598] >> Kirk: KEEP AN EYE
[ct=3161.535] ON THIS GUY,
[ct=3163.020] HE’S THERE TO HELP
[ct=3163.530] OUT, JUST A CHECK
[ct=3165.111] HOW MANY TIMES IF
[ct=3166.860] YOU’RE A LIONS FAN
[ct=3168.076] HAVE WE SEEN THAT?
[ct=3169.307] YOU CLEAR IT OUT.
[ct=3170.361] THE RECEIVERS ARE SO
[ct=3171.911] TALENTED.
[ct=3172.589] THE SAFETIES, THE LINE
[ct=3173.011] BACKERS ARE GETTING
[ct=3174.063] DEEP TO TAKE AWAY
[ct=3175.530] THOSE MIDDLE FIELD DIG
[ct=3178.069] ROUTES THAT HE LOVES,
[ct=3179.164] AND HE’S SO AWARE THAT
[ct=3180.455] ONCE IT’S TAKEN AWAY
[ct=3182.500] ESPECIALLY ON THIRD
[ct=3183.137] DOWN, CHECK IT DOWN TO
[ct=3183.607] MONTGOMERY OR GIBBS
[ct=3185.056] AND LET THEM DO THE
[ct=3191.566] WORK AFTER THE CATCH.
[ct=3193.909] >> Al: FIRST DOWN BY
[ct=3194.751] THE 31.
[ct=3197.856] GOFF, BUYS TIME, OPEN,
[ct=3199.853] LAPORTA INSIDE THE 20.
[ct=3202.418] AND STOPPED THERE BY
[ct=3205.043] ABOUT SIX WHITE
[ct=3205.043] SHIRTS.
[ct=3206.057] >> Kirk: BOY, IS THAT
[ct=3206.342] GREAT.
[ct=3206.669] WHEN YOU RUN THE
[ct=3208.707] FOOTBALL AND EVEN IF
[ct=3210.961] THEY’RE NOT RUNNING IT
[ct=3211.268] GREAT TONIGHT, AGAIN
[ct=3212.487] SOME PUSHING AND
[ct=3214.998] SHOVING.
[ct=3215.465] SULES RIGHT IN THE
[ct=3218.948] MIDDLE OF IT, 95 WYATT
[ct=3220.114] RIGHT THERE WITH HIM,
[ct=3220.644] GOING YOU CAN RUN THE
[ct=3221.406] FOOTBALL LIKE THIS.
[ct=3221.927] THIS IS THE STORY OF
[ct=3224.433] REALLY BEN JOHNSON’S
[ct=3225.730] EARLY DOWN-PLAY
[ct=3226.368] ACTION.
[ct=3226.788] YOU GET THOSE LINE
[ct=3228.183] BACKERS RUNNING
[ct=3228.832] TOWARDS GIBBS TO STOP
[ct=3230.911] HIM FROM RUNNING, AND
[ct=3232.405] THEN YOU’RE ABLE TO
[ct=3233.888] MOVE THAT LAUNCHING
[ct=3235.490] POINT AND GET GOFF
[ct=3236.215] AWAY FROM THE
[ct=3238.782] PRESSURE, IS HE’S GOT
[ct=3240.066] A WIDE OPEN LAPORTA
[ct=3246.030] THERE ON THE BACKSIDE.
[ct=3247.363] >> Al: TICKING DOWN TO
[ct=3249.740] THE 2-MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=3250.836] AND THEY HAD TO GET A
[ct=3252.128] PLAY OFF OTHERWISE IT
[ct=3253.281] WOULD HAVE BEEN DELAY
[ct=3254.736] OF GAME.
[ct=3256.538] AND IT’S A RUN
[ct=3257.601] FOR GIBBS.
[ct=3258.137] AND THAT WILL TAKE US
[ct=3259.524] TO THE 2-MINUTE
[ct=3261.220] WARNING OFFICIALLY
[ct=3262.520] WITH 1:53 LEFT
[ct=3263.640] LEAD IN THE
[ct=3264.557] CHAMPIONSHIP GAME OUT
[ct=3265.257] IN SAN FRANCISCO,
[ct=3267.012] ENDED UP NOT ABLE TO
[ct=3268.038] FINISH THAT OFF.
[ct=3269.365] THE NINERS WAN THE
[ct=3270.283] SUPER BOWL, AND HE HAD
[ct=3271.727] ALL THOSE INTERVIEWS.
[ct=3273.475] HE SAID I’M NOT QUITE
[ct=3275.329] READY TO LEAVE THIS
[ct=3276.893] >> Al: YOU’VE GOT TO
[ct=3277.703] WIPED UP WITH THE
[ct=3278.819] RIGHT ORGANIZATION.
[ct=3279.630] >> Kirk: THAT’S TRUE.
[ct=3281.117] >> Al: 2nd SQUUN DO7.
[ct=3281.667] QUICK TRIP TO THE
[ct=3282.458] RIGHT SIDE.
[ct=3284.350] LAPORTA, LOOK AT HIM
[ct=3286.954] BLOW HIS WAY TO THE
[ct=3291.740] 4-YARD LIENE.
[ct=3293.969] 4th AND GOAL.
[ct=3295.355] >> Kirk: SULE GETS OUT
[ct=3297.780] THERE AND ZEITLER, THE
[ct=3298.798] RIGHT GUARD YOU’LL SEE
[ct=3301.724] 71 AND 58 DO GOOD,
[ct=3303.931] TOUGH RUNNING.
[ct=3304.243] LAPORTA YARDS AFTER
[ct=3304.574] THE CATCH,
[ct=3306.517] BUT IT SURE HELPS
[ct=3309.540] GETTING THOSE LINEMEN
[ct=3310.605] OUT IN FRONT PAVING
[ct=3314.252] >> Al: 1st AND GOAL.
[ct=3315.578] CLOCK RUNNING DOWN ON
[ct=3317.236] 1:15.
[ct=3330.104] FINDING HIS WAY, JUST
[ct=3330.449] A LITTLE SHORT TO THE
[ct=3332.706] ONE OR EVEN INSIDE 2nd
[ct=3335.040] TIMEOUT TAKEN BY GREEN
[ct=3336.873] BAY WITH 60 SECONDS
[ct=3340.695] >> Kirk: YEAH, GOOD
[ct=3341.359] NOT FITZ.
[ct=3341.598] SOMEBODY HAS
[ct=3344.292] DISAPPEARED.
[ct=3345.416] HALFTIME SHOW COMING
[ct=3347.756] BROUGHT TO YOU BY
[ct=3348.318] STATE FARM.
[ct=3349.172] 2nd AND GOAL FROM
[ct=3351.947] 2.
[ct=3352.864] GOFF GOING TO KEEP IT
[ct=3356.770] HIMSELF AND TAKE IT
[ct=3358.318] TO -- NO SIGNAL YET.
[ct=3358.955] NO SIGNAL.
[ct=3364.856] NOW THERE IS.
[ct=3365.817] HAD TO COME IN AND GET
[ct=3370.049] A CLOSER LOOK AT IT.
[ct=3370.982] >> Kirk: HE CALLED OFF
[ct=3372.078] OF THE PLAY THAT THEY
[ct=3372.726] HAD.
[ct=3374.675] HE SAW THAT GAP OVER
[ct=3376.240] THE LEFT SHOULDER OF
[ct=3377.902] THE CENTER, AND HE LET
[ct=3378.622] EVERYBODY KNOW HE WAS
[ct=3379.712] GOING TO KEEP IT.
[ct=3383.334] MADE A GOOD DECISION.
[ct=3383.994] >> Al: HOLD ON, HE IS
[ct=3385.692] SO ONE OFFICIAL COMES
[ct=3388.574] IN FROM THE SIDE.
[ct=3389.264] AFTER A LONG WAIT,
[ct=3391.334] THERE’S YOUR --
[ct=3393.586] KNEE.
[ct=3395.193] IT’S DOWN.
[ct=3395.515] >> Al: BALL IS NOT
[ct=3397.724] ACROSS THE GOAL LINE.
[ct=3399.390] >> Kirk: GREAT LOOK
[ct=3402.502] BRINGS THE KNEE DOWN.
[ct=3404.025] HE’S SHORT.
[ct=3405.782] >> Referee: IN ASPECT
[ct=3406.778] OF THE PLAY WE MUST
[ct=3407.983] RUN 10 SECONDS.
[ct=3409.420] GREEN BAY HAS ELECTED
[ct=3410.167] TO USE THEIR LAST
[ct=3412.559] TIMEOUT IN LIEU OF THE
[ct=3414.056] 10-SECOND RUNOFF.
[ct=3414.341] THIRD AND FINAL
[ct=3416.252] TIMEOUT, GREEN BAY.
[ct=3416.954] >> Al: RIGHT, THEY
[ct=3418.376] TOOK TWO ON THIS DRIVE
[ct=3419.564] AND COST THEM ONE WHEN
[ct=3421.820] THEY MISSED THE
[ct=3424.650] IT WAS NOT OVERTURNED,
[ct=3425.957] SO IT’S 3rd DOWN AND
[ct=3428.399] GOAL NOW FROM INSIDE
[ct=3429.169] THE 1 YARD LINE.
[ct=3429.890] >> Kirk: MEANWHILE,
[ct=3430.786] DAN CAMPBELL ONE OF
[ct=3431.642] THE THINGS HE
[ct=3433.312] MENTIONED TO US IS THE
[ct=3434.790] ONUS IS ON OUR
[ct=3437.379] WITH THE NEW FACES WE
[ct=3438.507] HAVE THIS WEEK, NOT
[ct=3439.750] ONLY ARE WE TRYING TO
[ct=3442.271] SCORE POINTS, BUT
[ct=3443.571] CLOCK AND THEY HAVE A
[ct=3445.688] 5-MINUTE THIRD
[ct=3448.615] POSSESSION ADVANTAGE,
[ct=3448.966] SO THEY’RE KEEPING
[ct=3450.287] JORDAN LOVE ON THE
[ct=3452.426] SIDELINE.
[ct=3452.938] THIS FIRST HALF,
[ct=3454.000] KEEPING HIM OUT OF
[ct=3456.325] RHYTHM.
[ct=3460.229] >> Al: 3rd AND THAT
[ct=3461.971] MONTGOMERY IS IN
[ct=3465.189] RESETTING THE GAME
[ct=3466.220] CLOCK IS WHAT’S GOING
[ct=3467.330] ON RIGHT HERE.
[ct=3469.159] GOING TO RESET IT TO 1
[ct=3469.743] MINUTE.
[ct=3471.159] THAT’S THE REASON FOR
[ct=3473.513] THE DELAY HERE.
[ct=3474.774] THERE YOU GO.
[ct=3482.829] JUST FOR THE MOMENT,
[ct=3483.472] TIME IS STANDING
[ct=3484.287] STILL.
[ct=3485.597] OKAY, WE’RE GOOD.
[ct=3486.267] 60 SECONDS.
[ct=3499.255] THEIR RUNNING BACK,
[ct=3500.299] HE’S ALREADY BEEN INTO
[ct=3503.610] THE END ZONE TONIGHT.
[ct=3506.616] AND HE’LL GET STUFFED
[ct=3508.200] AT THE 1.
[ct=3509.733] KENNY CLARK IS THERE.
[ct=3510.421] SO IT’S GOING TO BE
[ct=3512.416] 4th DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=3514.906] DANGER AGAINST HAVING
[ct=3518.161] A GUY LIKE KENNY CLARK
[ct=3521.660] GOING UP AGAINST THIS
[ct=3523.240] CENTER NOW.
[ct=3524.291] YOU’LL SEE HIM GET OFF
[ct=3526.545] THE BALL AND WORK INTO
[ct=3529.605] THAT POWER BACKFIELD
[ct=3529.605] AND FREES UP THOSE
[ct=3531.392] BACKERS AS WELL.
[ct=3532.980] RASHAN GARY ABLE TO
[ct=3534.173] COME OFF THE EDGE AND
[ct=3535.089] HELP CLEAN THAT UP.
[ct=3536.571] SO THEY USE ABOUT A
[ct=3537.717] YARD AND A HALF.
[ct=3538.864] >> Al: SO IT’S 4th AND
[ct=3542.003] GREEN BAY DOES GET THE
[ct=3542.377] BALL BACK.
[ct=3543.059] READY TO TAKE A
[ct=3544.698] TIMEOUT HERE.
[ct=3544.991] THEY’RE JUST WAITING
[ct=3545.795] FOR THE CLOCK TO
[ct=3546.632] RUN-DOWN.
[ct=3546.873] AND THEY’LL TAKE THE
[ct=3548.652] TIMEOUT.
[ct=3550.430] IT’LL STOP AT 14
[ct=3551.384] SECONDS AND 4th
[ct=3554.577] HUGE PLAY IN THIS ONE.
[ct=3555.429] GREEN BAY’S GOING TO
[ct=3556.265] GET THE BALL TO START
[ct=3559.508] THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=3561.234] >> Kirk: OH, THIS IS
[ct=3562.383] WHERE YOU WOULD ASSUME
[ct=3563.690] THEY’RE KEEPING THEIR
[ct=3564.557] OFFENSE OUT IN THE
[ct=3565.955] YOU WOULD ASSUME WITH
[ct=3566.783] A VETERAN QUARTERBACK
[ct=3568.071] WHO SEES THE FIELD SO
[ct=3570.093] WELL, PROCESSES
[ct=3573.052] QUICKLY, YOU KNOW, YOU
[ct=3574.211] WOULD THINK GREEN BAY
[ct=3574.622] WOULD BRING SOME
[ct=3575.952] YOU’VE GOT TO RELY ON
[ct=3577.160] YOUR OFFENSIVE LINE,
[ct=3578.061] AND YOU’VE GOT TO FIND
[ct=3579.015] A WAY TO CREATE A
[ct=3582.523] MATCHUP FOR ST. BROWN,
[ct=3584.871] 18, OR 87 LAPORTA.
[ct=3585.738] DOWN HERE THAT’S WHERE
[ct=3586.723] THEY CAN WIN IF THEY
[ct=3587.523] CAN FIND A MATCHUP
[ct=3590.206] THAT’S FAVORABLE.
[ct=3590.494] >> Al: NOW THEY’VE GOT
[ct=3590.794] GIBBS IN THE
[ct=3593.681] IS GOFF TRYING TO
[ct=3596.554] SNEAK IT IN AGAIN?
[ct=3597.997] HASN’T SCORED A
[ct=3598.914] TOUCHDOWN THIS SEASON.
[ct=3600.658] HAD A TEMPORARY ONE.
[ct=3601.489] 12th PLAY OF THIS
[ct=3606.413] BACKS UP, THROWS.
[ct=3608.836] TOUCHDOWN TO GIBBS.
[ct=3619.263] DIALLED UP THE
[ct=3620.391] THEY BROUGHT QUAY
[ct=3621.378] WALKER, BUT WHAT A
[ct=3622.289] CALL TALKING ABOUT
[ct=3623.749] LAPORTA AND ST. BROWN.
[ct=3625.181] HOW CAN YOU FORGET
[ct=3626.095] ABOUT GIBBS OUT OF THE
[ct=3627.458] BACKFIELD?
[ct=3628.561] YOU GET HIM ONE-ON-ONE
[ct=3630.572] AGAINST A LINEBACKER.
[ct=3631.912] ISAIAH McDUFFIE DREW
[ct=3633.496] THE SHORT STRAW.
[ct=3634.466] NO CHANCE ON THIS
[ct=3635.278] ANGLE ROUTE TO STAND
[ct=3635.682] WITH HIM.
[ct=3637.631] AND I’LL TELL YOU,
[ct=3640.330] GIBBS SOLD IT WELL TO
[ct=3641.663] THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=3641.663] >> Al: BATES FOR THE
[ct=3642.454] EXTRA POINT.
[ct=3647.512] AND THAT ONE IS JUST
[ct=3647.870] GOOD.
[ct=3650.789] BUT GOOD NONETHELESS,
[ct=3652.324] SO IT’S 17-7.
[ct=3652.324] >> Kirk: YOU WANT TO
[ct=3653.690] SEE HOW TO RUN THIS
[ct=3654.243] AGAINST MANNED
[ct=3656.219] COVERAGE, GIBBS IN
[ct=3657.851] COLLEGE WITH ALABAMA
[ct=3658.590] RUNS ROUTES WITH
[ct=3659.393] RECEIVERS.
[ct=3660.554] HE SELLS IT OUT THERE
[ct=3661.451] BUT THEN WORKS BACK
[ct=3663.068] UNDERNEATH.
[ct=3663.694] McDUFFIE AGAIN TRIES
[ct=3664.234] TO STAY WITH HIM.
[ct=3665.341] YOU SEE HIM TURN HIS
[ct=3666.063] SHOULDERS TO START
[ct=3666.769] STOOSPRINT TO GET OUT
[ct=3668.689] TO THE OUTSIDE IN A
[ct=3669.255] FLAT.
[ct=3671.123] HE HAD NO CHANCE OF
[ct=3671.498] TURNING AROUND.
[ct=3672.652] THAT IS A GREAT ROUTE
[ct=3674.910] AND WENT IN ONE-ON-ONE
[ct=3676.363] BY JAHMYR GIBBS AND
[ct=3677.809] HECK OF A CALL BY BEN
[ct=3678.861] JOHNSON, THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=3679.831] COORDINATOR, TO GET
[ct=3681.145] HIM ISOLATED AND GET
[ct=3682.458] THAT MATCHUP TO
[ct=3687.214] >> Al: AND LaFLEUR’S
[ct=3687.630] EXPRESSION SAYS IT
[ct=3689.936] ALL.
[ct=3691.104] TURNING A 3-POINT
[ct=3692.368] DEFICIT INTO A
[ct=3696.287] 10-POINT DEFICIT.
[ct=3697.835] >> Kirk: GREEN BAY,
[ct=3697.835] YOU MENTION GETTING
[ct=3701.371] THE BALL TO START THE
[ct=3701.371] SECOND HALF.
[ct=3702.003] THEY’VE GOT TO FIGURE
[ct=3703.209] OUT A WAY TO PROTECT
[ct=3703.886] THEIR QUARTERBACK,
[ct=3706.617] JORDAN LOVE.
[ct=3707.168] HE’S BEEN PRESSURED.
[ct=3709.346] THEY HAVE BLITZED HIM.
[ct=3710.001] HIS ONE DECENT
[ct=3710.775] COMPLETION TO WATSON
[ct=3712.621] ENDED UP A FUMBLE.
[ct=3713.811] A 20-YARD RECEPTION.
[ct=3716.132] IT WAS A FUMBLE.
[ct=3723.985] >> Al: GREEN BAY HELD
[ct=3728.116] ONLY 105 YARDS IN THE
[ct=3728.434] HALF.
[ct=3729.776] BALL WILL COME OUT TO
[ct=3731.011] THE 30 WITH THE TIME
[ct=3732.630] FOR ONE OR TWO PLAYS
[ct=3733.672] UNLESS THEY JUST WANT
[ct=3735.891] TO KNEEL IT DOWN, GO
[ct=3737.398] TO THE LOCKER ROOM,
[ct=3738.732] TAKE THE BALL, AND WE
[ct=3740.109] START THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=3741.400] LAST TIME THEY HAD THE
[ct=3744.262] BALL, IT WAS -- THEY
[ct=3747.097] RAN THE FOOTBALL, YOU
[ct=3747.348] KNOW, AND --
[ct=3747.938] >> Al: HAD 12-PLAY
[ct=3750.334] DRIVE, 10 RUNS.
[ct=3751.352] >> Kirk: YEAH.
[ct=3752.425] SO YOU’RE DOWN 10,
[ct=3752.944] DOWN IN THE SECOND
[ct=3755.198] HALF, IT’S NOT TIME
[ct=3755.958] OBVIOUSLY TO PANIC.
[ct=3756.810] YOU GET THE BALL TO
[ct=3757.579] START IT.
[ct=3760.578] BUT COMBINATION OF
[ct=3760.966] RELYING ON THAT LINE
[ct=3761.985] IN JACOBS AND TRYING
[ct=3762.943] TO FIND WAYS TO HELP
[ct=3763.732] THIS QUARTERBACK HAVE
[ct=3766.887] TIME TO THROW.
[ct=3768.233] >> Al: KNEEL DOWN.
[ct=3769.217] TAKES US TO HALF TIME.
[ct=3771.100] GO TO KAYLEE.
[ct=3771.348] >> WELL,
[ct=3774.196] THREE COMPLETIONS,
[ct=3775.248] HE’S VERY CAPABLE, BUT
[ct=3776.765] THE DETROITER ANSWER
[ct=3778.430] TO HAVING ALL THIS
[ct=3778.995] INEXPERIENCE ON
[ct=3780.973] DEFENSE IS NOT SIT
[ct=3781.791] BACK AND MAKE THESE
[ct=3783.202] GUYS HAVE TO THINK.
[ct=3784.551] TURN THEM LOOSE, JUST
[ct=3785.420] GO AFTER THE
[ct=3786.341] QUARTERBACK WHEN HE
[ct=3787.548] DROPS BACK TO THROW.
[ct=3788.943] AND IT WORKED FOR A
[ct=3791.813] I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE
[ct=3794.713] WHAT MATT LaFLEUR’S
[ct=3796.075] ANSWER TO THAT IS IN
[ct=3800.462] DETROIT DEFENSE IS THE
[ct=3801.754] ANSWER IN THE SECOND
[ct=3803.236] WHAT A JOB THEY HAVE
[ct=3805.051] DONE.
[ct=3807.872] AND KAYLEE.
[ct=3808.123] >> THEY’VE HELD GREEN
[ct=3808.860] BAY TO 7 POINTS AND
[ct=3810.944] FORCED A TURNOVER.
[ct=3811.452] HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
[ct=3813.071] THEIR SUCCESS?
[ct=3814.755] >> LOOK, A.G.’S GOT A
[ct=3817.258] HELL A PLAN.
[ct=3817.989] MAKE THEM EARN
[ct=3819.182] ANYTHING THEY GET AND
[ct=3820.816] GET A TAKE AWAY.
[ct=3820.816] WE GOT ONE.
[ct=3821.843] WE’VE GOT TO GET
[ct=3822.674] ANOTHER ONE SECOND
[ct=3824.263] >> OFFENSIVELY YOU’VE
[ct=3824.739] CONTROLLED THE BALL
[ct=3825.695] AND PUT UP 17.
[ct=3826.370] HOW DO YOU REPLICATE
[ct=3828.173] THAT IN A SECOND?
[ct=3828.494] >> SAME THING, WE’RE
[ct=3829.307] DOING EXACTLY WHAT WE
[ct=3830.581] NEEDED TO DO AND WHAT
[ct=3831.317] WE SAID WE NEEDED TO
[ct=3831.682] DO.
[ct=3832.378] WE’VE GOT TO BE MORE
[ct=3834.040] EFFICIENT RUNNING THE
[ct=3836.356] FOOTBALL AND THAT WILL
[ct=3837.075] OPEN EVERYTHING UP FOR
[ct=3837.075] US.
[ct=3838.257] >> HERE WE GO, THIRD
[ct=3839.448] QUARTER BEGINS OUT OF
[ct=3841.518] THE PISTOL WITH LOVE.
[ct=3842.256] HANDING THE BALL,
[ct=3843.658] JACOBS TO THE OUTSIDE,
[ct=3844.532] AND THAT’S THE WAY THE
[ct=3845.810] FIRST HALF LOOKED MOST
[ct=3847.439] OF THE TIME.
[ct=3848.486] BRYAN BRANCH COMES UP
[ct=3849.327] TO KNOCK HIM DOWN THE
[ct=3852.697] BACKFIELD, 2nd AND 11.
[ct=3853.214] >> MAN IS HE FUN TO
[ct=3855.904] WATCH PLAY AGAINST THE
[ct=3855.904] RUN.
[ct=3856.651] HE MOVED FROM THAT
[ct=3857.730] NICKEL SPOT WHERE THEY
[ct=3858.963] PLAYED HIM BACK AT
[ct=3859.956] SAFETY, BUT WHEN HE
[ct=3862.462] READS RUN, HE KNOWS
[ct=3864.087] HOW TO GET UP, HOLD
[ct=3864.821] THAT EDGE AND LOWER
[ct=3865.506] THE BOOM.
[ct=3866.226] THOSE ARE TWO COLLEGE
[ct=3868.422] PLAYERS FROM THE SAME
[ct=3868.689] SCHOOL IN ALABAMA.
[ct=3869.885] AND JACOBS I THINK
[ct=3872.272] SURPRISED BY THE FORCE
[ct=3873.116] THERE OF BRYAN BRANCH.
[ct=3875.869] >> Al: WE DO ALL THESE
[ct=3876.175] GAMES I THINK HALF THE
[ct=3877.804] PLAYERS IN THE LEAGUE
[ct=3878.669] OR EITHER ALABAMA OR
[ct=3879.579] GEORGIA.
[ct=3880.989] YOU WOULD KNOW.
[ct=3886.208] 2nd AND 11.
[ct=3887.363] DEEP DROP.
[ct=3888.245] HAS TIME.
[ct=3890.942] GOING DEEP, HAS HIS
[ct=3892.501] MAN!
[ct=3893.259] CAUGHT AND TAKEN DOWN
[ct=3894.743] TO THE 10 YARD LINE IS
[ct=3896.374] CHRISTIAN WATSON.
[ct=3897.371] SO YOU FIGURE SOONER
[ct=3899.035] OR LATER THAT GUY
[ct=3899.577] MIGHT GET FREE, AND IT
[ct=3905.902] HAPPENS RIGHT THERE?
[ct=3906.308] HAPPENS RIGHT THERE.
[ct=3907.365] >> Kirk: AND A GOOD
[ct=3910.028] JOB BY THE LINE.
[ct=3910.028] HE WORKS BACK TO THE
[ct=3910.989] OUTSIDE, PUTS IT RIGHT
[ct=3912.149] ON THE MONEY.
[ct=3914.002] PROTECTION.
[ct=3914.684] GOOD JOB OF LOOKING
[ct=3916.132] OFF THAT SAFETY IN THE
[ct=3916.921] MIDDLE OF THE FIELD,
[ct=3919.591] AND ABLE TO JUST HANG
[ct=3920.138] IT UP THERE AND LET
[ct=3920.891] WATSON RUN RIGHT
[ct=3921.774] UNDERNEATH IT.
[ct=3923.594] GREAT PLAY.
[ct=3924.797] >> Al: 59 YARDS.
[ct=3925.592] IT’S THEIR FIRST
[ct=3928.434] PASSING FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3935.596] FIRST DOWN AT THE 12.
[ct=3935.977] PLAY FAKED.
[ct=3937.253] PASS IS DROPPED.
[ct=3939.169] THAT’S WATSON.
[ct=3940.766] IT’S SO FUNNY TALK
[ct=3941.505] ABOUT WATSON AND WHAT
[ct=3942.854] HE’S DONE, HE’S THE
[ct=3943.656] BIG PLAY GUY.
[ct=3944.457] IN HIS LAST SEVEN
[ct=3946.201] CATCHES HE’S AVERAGED
[ct=3946.638] 40 YARDS PER
[ct=3947.570] RECEPTION.
[ct=3948.941] >> Kirk: HE’S REALLY
[ct=3949.643] GROWN BECAUSE WHEN HE
[ct=3950.426] FIRST CAME INTO THE
[ct=3951.986] LEAGUE THAT’S WHAT HE
[ct=3952.295] WAS.
[ct=3953.320] HE’S A VERTICAL
[ct=3954.924] DOWNFIELD THREAT.
[ct=3956.077] AS HE’S GROWN, HE’S
[ct=3957.048] GOTTEN BETTER AT
[ct=3957.803] RUNNING DIFFERENT
[ct=3959.441] ROUTES, BUT THIS IS AN
[ct=3961.448] OFFENSE THAT NEEDED
[ct=3961.867] SOMETHING TO IGNITE
[ct=3962.648] THEM AND PUSH THIS
[ct=3963.927] DEFENSE BACK A BIT.
[ct=3964.819] HAD 31 YARDS PASSING
[ct=3965.801] IN THE ENTIRE FIRST
[ct=3966.701] HALF, AND IN THAT
[ct=3968.835] COMPLETION 59 AT ONE
[ct=3972.119] >> Al: 2nd AND 10.
[ct=3979.221] PLAY ACTION.
[ct=3980.438] GOING TO THE CORNER OF
[ct=3982.121] A LITTLE CONTACT
[ct=3983.493] THERE, BUT INCOMPLETE.
[ct=3984.598] AGAIN, WATSON COVERED
[ct=3985.728] THAT TIME BY CARLTON
[ct=3986.049] DAVIS.
[ct=3989.202] >> GUYS, THE LIONS FOR
[ct=3992.286] RULED OUT DEFENSIVE
[ct=3995.955] LINEMAN ALIM McNEILL
[ct=3996.460] FROM THIS GAME BECAUSE
[ct=3998.005] OF A HEAD INJURY.
[ct=3998.999] NOT A CONCUSSION BUT A
[ct=3999.562] HEAD INJURY.
[ct=4000.760] >> Al: WE SAW HIM GO
[ct=4002.353] INTO THE LOCKER ROOM,
[ct=4003.110] BUT HE’S DONE.
[ct=4004.414] 3rd AND 10.
[ct=4005.937] >> Kirk: THEY GET TO
[ct=4007.185] THESE THIRD DOWNS,
[ct=4008.115] THEY’RE DOWN ON
[ct=4008.715] PRESSURE FROM THE LINE
[ct=4011.408] BACKERS AND TRYING TO
[ct=4011.822] GET AFTER LOVE AND
[ct=4012.525] PLAY MAN-TO-MAN
[ct=4013.778] COVERAGE BEHIND IT.
[ct=4016.251] LET’S SEE WHAT THEY DO
[ct=4025.327] >> Al: DELAYED BLITZ.
[ct=4027.292] THE PASS TO THE END
[ct=4032.541] KRAFT, TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=4035.248] WOW, TUCKER KRAFT.
[ct=4035.503] AND BOY, DID THEY NEED
[ct=4037.024] THAT DRIVE.
[ct=4039.472] >> Kirk: BOY, WHAT A
[ct=4039.472] THROW.
[ct=4039.708] AND HOW ABOUT A
[ct=4042.314] MATCHUP WITH YOUR BIG
[ct=4042.588] TIGHT END.
[ct=4045.070] THIS GUY 6’5", 260
[ct=4045.894] POUNDS.
[ct=4048.482] AND HE PUT A LOT OF --
[ct=4049.710] A LOT OF HEAT ON THAT.
[ct=4051.407] I MEAN THAT IS EXACTLY
[ct=4053.038] WHAT HE HAD TO DO.
[ct=4054.141] HIS BIG BODY, HE HAD
[ct=4054.707] LEVERAGE ON THE
[ct=4056.061] CORNER.
[ct=4057.175] HE HAD TO PUT IT IN
[ct=4058.612] THERE BECAUSE HE WAS
[ct=4061.644] CLOSING -- DAVIS WAS
[ct=4064.273] CLOSING IN IN A HURRY.
[ct=4066.057] AND IF HE DIDN’T THROW
[ct=4066.595] IT WITH THAT VELOCITY,
[ct=4068.571] DAVIS COULD NOT HAVE DREAMT
[ct=4069.161] UP A BETTER WAY TO
[ct=4070.736] START THIS SECOND
[ct=4072.290] 1:45 RIGHT DOWN THE
[ct=4073.609] FIELD, AND THEY GET
[ct=4074.722] JORDAN LOVE GOING, CAN
[ct=4076.549] SOME EMOTION ON THAT
[ct=4077.524] SIDELINE FROM THE
[ct=4077.865] PACKERS AFTER THAT
[ct=4080.354] >> Al: TOUCH BACK
[ct=4081.639] >> Kirk: LET’S TAKE A
[ct=4082.384] PEEK AGAIN AT THE
[ct=4083.373] QUARTERBACK, JORDAN
[ct=4083.815] LOVE.
[ct=4084.169] WATCH HIS EYES
[ct=4085.261] LOOKING.
[ct=4085.635] HE’S GOING TO THROW TO
[ct=4086.403] THE RIGHT.
[ct=4087.372] HE’S JUST KIND OF
[ct=4088.142] LOOKING -- THIS IS ALL
[ct=4089.481] ON TIMING.
[ct=4089.924] HE’S PEEKING, HE’S
[ct=4090.761] PEEKING, AND NOW HE
[ct=4091.900] SEES THE COVERAGE.
[ct=4092.628] AND HE’S GOT TO PUT A
[ct=4093.688] LOT ON IT.
[ct=4095.601] GETS IT TO THE INSIDE
[ct=4096.405] WHERE KRAFT CAN USE
[ct=4098.913] HIS BODY, BUT IT’S FUN
[ct=4099.957] TO WATCH LOVE AND KIND
[ct=4101.269] OF GO INTO HIS MIND
[ct=4102.031] THERE, SEEING THOSE
[ct=4103.361] EYES, MAKING THAT
[ct=4104.039] PERFECT THROW THERE
[ct=4106.558] FOR THEIR TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=4106.812] >> Al: BEAUTIFUL SHOT
[ct=4107.088] OF THAT.
[ct=4107.809] THAT’S ALMOST LIKE A
[ct=4108.458] VISION TEST.
[ct=4109.372] DON’T MOVE YOUR HEAD,
[ct=4111.615] JUST YOUR EYES.
[ct=4111.867] >> Kirk: KRAFT
[ct=4113.260] WAVING -- WAVING
[ct=4115.000] EVERYBODY.
[ct=4116.131] >> Al: FROM THE 30
[ct=4121.905] GIBBS IS THE BACK.
[ct=4123.677] TRIES TO CUT TO THE
[ct=4127.527] SWARMED, AND A FLAG
[ct=4128.995] EACH TEAM HAS BEEN
[ct=4134.666] PENALIZED FIVE TIMES.
[ct=4134.937] ACCEPTED PENALTIES.
[ct=4135.166] >> Kirk: THEY MAY HAVE
[ct=4137.145] GOTTEN SULE, THE RIGHT
[ct=4141.311] TACKLE HERE.
[ct=4143.935] OFFENSE NUMBER 50.
[ct=4149.506] >> Kirk: THERE ISN’T
[ct=4151.333] 50 -- I THINK HE MEANT
[ct=4152.269] 58, SULE.
[ct=4154.364] HE GETS UP WITH KENNY
[ct=4156.137] CLARK, WORKING DOWN.
[ct=4156.137] KENNY CLARK’S JUST
[ct=4157.478] INSIDE OF HIM JUST
[ct=4160.026] TRYING TO SEAL.
[ct=4161.264] THAT LEFT ARM GETS UP
[ct=4163.012] AROUND THE NECK.
[ct=4165.172] SO THE PACKERS, THAT’S
[ct=4168.215] KIND OF BEEN THEIR
[ct=4169.520] TENDENCY THIS YEAR.
[ct=4170.015] THAT’S SECOND MOST IN
[ct=4171.827] THE NFL.
[ct=4173.162] >> Al: 1st AND 20.
[ct=4174.026] CATCH IS MADE.
[ct=4175.351] BEFORE WE GET AWAY
[ct=4177.025] FROM SEWELL AND TALK
[ct=4178.740] FOURTH YEAR IN THE
[ct=4180.205] LEAGUE, NUMBER ONE
[ct=4181.047] PICK OUT OF OREGON
[ct=4182.707] BACK IN ’21.
[ct=4183.725] THIS IS GUY HE’S NOT
[ct=4184.770] MISSED A SNAP SINCE
[ct=4186.821] THE 2021 SEASON.
[ct=4187.648] COMING INTO TONIGHT HE
[ct=4190.299] HAD PLAYED 3,103
[ct=4191.893] CONSECUTIVE SNAPS.
[ct=4193.095] >> Kirk: YOU’RE NEVER
[ct=4193.642] GOING TO SEE THAT
[ct=4193.945] AGAIN.
[ct=4195.436] HASN’T ALLOWED A SACK
[ct=4196.331] BUT HAS BEEN SACKED
[ct=4197.232] HIMSELF.
[ct=4198.167] >> Al: RIGHT, EXACTLY.
[ct=4199.591] >> Kirk: TRIED TO LET
[ct=4201.373] THE BIG MAN THROW IT.
[ct=4202.124] TELLS YOU WHAT KIND
[ct=4204.435] ATHLETE HE IS.
[ct=4205.921] >> Al: 2nd AND 14.
[ct=4208.651] NOW FIRES.
[ct=4210.088] IT’S INTERCEPTED.
[ct=4212.022] NIXON WITH THE PICK.
[ct=4214.344] AND DOWN THE SIDELINE
[ct=4218.106] HE GOES, KEISEAN NIXON
[ct=4219.602] WITH THE INTERCEPTION.
[ct=4220.293] AND GOFF WHO RARELY
[ct=4222.528] THROWS A PICK.
[ct=4225.396] IN FACT, IN 8 OF THE
[ct=4226.675] LAST 9 GAMES HE’S
[ct=4227.437] THROWN NONE.
[ct=4228.956] IN ONE GAME HE THREW
[ct=4230.276] FIVE AND STILL WON THE
[ct=4231.725] GETS PICKED OFF HERE.
[ct=4232.379] >> Kirk: HIS EYES I
[ct=4233.278] FELT LIKE THEY WENT TO
[ct=4234.008] THE MIDDLE OF THE
[ct=4234.829] COVERAGE, TO OUR
[ct=4236.848] RIGHT THERE.
[ct=4237.811] AND THEN DIDN’T REALLY
[ct=4238.910] LOOK OUT TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=4239.388] HE CAME OFF FROM THE
[ct=4241.112] MIDDLE JUST TRYING TO
[ct=4241.813] LOOK THE DEFENSE OFF,
[ct=4242.661] AND BEFORE HE COULD
[ct=4243.471] REALLY HAVE A CHANCE
[ct=4244.356] TO MAKE A DECISION ON
[ct=4245.582] IT, I BETTER NOT MAKE
[ct=4248.240] THIS THROW, HE JUST
[ct=4248.796] FLIPS IT OUT THERE AND
[ct=4250.403] NIXON WHO’S THEIR BEST
[ct=4254.298] COVER GUY WITH
[ct=4256.308] ALEXANDER DOWN, DID A
[ct=4257.501] GREAT JOB OF FIELDING
[ct=4258.942] THE ROUTE, STEPS IN
[ct=4260.087] FRONT OF IT, AND HERE
[ct=4262.008] COME THE PACKERS.
[ct=4263.149] >> Al: NIXON HAD NOT
[ct=4264.303] HAD A PICK THIS
[ct=4266.180] GOFF BARKING AT
[ct=4269.489] FIRST DOWN AT THE 16
[ct=4276.355] GIBBS TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=4277.555] SHORT GAIN.
[ct=4280.400] AND BRANCH PAYS THE
[ct=4281.976] PRICE.
[ct=4282.231] VERY SLOW IN
[ct=4283.437] ATTEMPTING TO GET UP,
[ct=4285.171] AND NOW HE DOES.
[ct=4287.570] SO JACOBS 2nd DOWN AND
[ct=4287.774] 8.
[ct=4291.997] >> Kirk: WHAT A BLOCK
[ct=4293.085] BY ZACH TOM.
[ct=4298.638] HE AND SEAN RYAN CAME
[ct=4302.058] IN TOGETHER.
[ct=4305.054] LIKE I SAID TOM GETS
[ct=4306.441] OFTEN.
[ct=4308.175] THAT TIME HE’S ABLE TO
[ct=4309.348] SET THAT EDGE ON THAT
[ct=4314.001] >> Al: JOHN RYAN BACK
[ct=4314.818] IN.
[ct=4316.238] JACOBS 11, CARRIES 50
[ct=4317.531] LOVE FIRES, CAUGHT,
[ct=4318.406] AND TRYING TO REACH
[ct=4320.696] FOR THAT FIRST DOWN IS
[ct=4322.871] LOOKS TO BE -- YEP,
[ct=4323.723] HE’S GOT THAT FIRST
[ct=4326.984] >> Kirk: YOU MENTIONED
[ct=4327.442] WHEN WE FIRST CAME
[ct=4327.837] BACK HERE IN THE
[ct=4329.840] SECOND HALF, ROMEO
[ct=4330.259] DOUBS IS OUT.
[ct=4332.448] AND IT’S GIVEN
[ct=4334.323] DONTAYVION WICKS MORE
[ct=4335.687] OPPORTUNITIES TONIGHT.
[ct=4336.218] REALLY GOOD BLOCKERS,
[ct=4337.505] HAD SOME DROPS.
[ct=4338.940] THAT TIME LOOKED IT IN
[ct=4341.942] >> Al: GO IN A HURRY
[ct=4342.340] TO AVOIDGY DEFENSIVE
[ct=4342.943] CHANGES.
[ct=4343.907] AND WORKING HIS WAY IS
[ct=4346.179] JOSH JACOBS, FINDING
[ct=4347.488] HIS WAY INTO THE END
[ct=4349.476] AND THE GREEN BAY
[ct=4350.791] PACKERS -- THAT DIDN’T
[ct=4352.088] TAKE LONG.
[ct=4354.772] TOOK THEM 3 MINUTES
[ct=4355.925] AND 45 SECONDS TO
[ct=4358.224] ERASE A 10-POINT
[ct=4358.481] DEFICIT AND TAKE THE
[ct=4360.007] LEAD.
[ct=4360.788] >> Kirk: AND, AL,
[ct=4363.173] YOU’RE EXACTLY RIGHT,
[ct=4363.517] THAT HURRY-UP --
[ct=4364.638] REMEMBER A LOT OF NEW
[ct=4365.810] FACES ON THIS DETROIT
[ct=4367.139] THEY WERE COMPLETELY
[ct=4367.984] CAUGHT OFF-GUARD.
[ct=4368.592] LOOK AT THEM TRYING TO
[ct=4369.473] GET EVERYBODY ON THE
[ct=4370.164] SAME PAGE.
[ct=4372.434] ROBERT MARTIN WHO’S
[ct=4372.937] BEEN HERE BUT HADN’T
[ct=4373.874] PLAYED A LOT OF
[ct=4374.473] FOOTBALL, HE’S NOT
[ct=4375.776] ABLE TO GET LINED UP,
[ct=4376.667] AND THAT’S A MISTAKE
[ct=4378.682] AGAINST A POWERFUL
[ct=4380.130] RUNNING JOSH JACOBS
[ct=4380.130] WHO BOUNCES ALL THE
[ct=4381.174] WAY INTO THE END ZONE
[ct=4383.037] FOR THAT TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=4383.835] >> Al: SEVEN TOUCH
[ct=4384.573] DOWNS IN HIS LAST FOUR
[ct=4387.174] GAMES FOR JACOBS.
[ct=4387.425] McMANUS FOR THE POINT
[ct=4388.328] AFTER.
[ct=4389.000] AND JUST LIKE THAT,
[ct=4391.825] GREEN BAY 21, DETROIT
[ct=4392.040] 17 ON THURSDAY NIGHT
[ct=4399.362] HIS PICKS, HE JUST
[ct=4401.753] THREW ONE THERE.
[ct=4404.768] THAT’S HIS FIRST ONE
[ct=4406.365] SINCE -- WELL, SINCE
[ct=4407.053] HE THREW FIVE IN ONE
[ct=4408.254] GAME AND STILL WON THE
[ct=4409.074] GAME IN HOUSTON A FEW
[ct=4411.205] WEEKS AGO.
[ct=4413.020] MEANWHILE, KICK OFF
[ct=4415.418] AND DETROIT WILL START
[ct=4419.857] DOWN BY 4.
[ct=4421.625] TOUGH ACCOMPLISHMENT.
[ct=4422.473] FIVE INTERCEPTIONS IN
[ct=4424.581] ONE GAME AND WIN THE
[ct=4425.364] >> Al: LOOK AT IT.
[ct=4428.706] HE HAD FOUR IN HIS
[ct=4431.162] LAST THREE GAMES AND
[ct=4433.738] HAD THAT ONE CRAZY
[ct=4434.088] GAME IN HOUSTON AND
[ct=4434.503] THEN ONE TONIGHT.
[ct=4435.626] >> Kirk: YEAH, THIS --
[ct=4436.840] YOU WANT TO SEE A
[ct=4437.785] VETERAN BOUNCE BACK
[ct=4438.627] FROM THAT.
[ct=4440.609] LET’S WATCH GOFF AND
[ct=4441.948] THIS OFFENSE.
[ct=4444.645] AFTER JUST TAKING A
[ct=4445.891] COUPLE BODY BLOWS HERE
[ct=4448.736] TO START THE SECOND
[ct=4449.922] >> Al: ST. BROWN’S
[ct=4451.038] BEEN QUIET.
[ct=4451.941] HE WAS IN MOTION THAT
[ct=4455.514] GOFF CHECKS IT DOWN.
[ct=4457.140] 5-YARD PICKUP HERE FOR
[ct=4459.153] 2nd AND 5.
[ct=4461.248] STOKES.
[ct=4461.712] >> Kirk: THERE’S SOME
[ct=4462.500] POPPING GOING ON
[ct=4463.705] BOTH THESE DEFENSES
[ct=4464.540] ARE FLYING AROUND AND
[ct=4466.247] HITTING PEOPLE.
[ct=4467.700] HERE THEY GO TEMPO.
[ct=4468.137] >> Al: THEY GO
[ct=4470.616] HURRY-UP FROM THE 35
[ct=4472.809] GOFF CHECKS IT TO OVER
[ct=4476.835] THE MIDDLE IS THEIR
[ct=4477.219] FORWARD PROGRESS FOR
[ct=4477.738] THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4479.160] AND THERE APPEARS TO
[ct=4482.408] BE HERE FOR KENT
[ct=4483.155] PATRICK.
[ct=4484.049] RIGHT AT THE 40 AND
[ct=4488.073] THAT’S A GOOD DECISION
[ct=4488.951] BY BEN JOHNSON AFTER
[ct=4490.351] THE INTERCEPTION, GO A
[ct=4491.243] BIT OF TEMPO, TRUSTING
[ct=4492.479] THE QUARTERBACK TO GET
[ct=4493.706] BACK UP ON THE SADDLE.
[ct=4495.260] THIS IS A GUY THAT’S
[ct=4496.156] BOUNCED BACK, SHOWED
[ct=4497.778] YOU RESILIENCY HIS
[ct=4498.874] ENTIRE CAREER.
[ct=4506.106] >> Al: TOSS IT BACK
[ct=4507.519] TRYING TO CUT BACK.
[ct=4510.674] GAIN OF 2 FOR JAHMYR
[ct=4513.398] >> Kirk: I ASKED JEFF
[ct=4515.224] HAFLEY.
[ct=4515.487] I SAID, YOU KNOW, WHEN
[ct=4517.778] YOU FACE A TEAM THAT
[ct=4519.332] LOVES TO RUN THE
[ct=4521.040] OUTSIDE GAME PLAY AS
[ct=4523.676] MUCH AS THEY DO, WHAT
[ct=4524.602] DO YOU DO?
[ct=4525.020] HE SAID WE’VE GOT TO
[ct=4525.530] SET THE EDGE
[ct=4526.816] PENETRATION AND STAY
[ct=4527.084] ON OUR FEET.
[ct=4527.915] THAT WAS A GOOD
[ct=4528.653] EXAMPLE RIGHT THERE.
[ct=4530.102] THEY SET THE EDGE AND
[ct=4531.609] THE DEFENSIVE LINEMEN
[ct=4532.673] ABLE TO CLOSE IN BY
[ct=4533.476] STAYING ON THEIR FEET
[ct=4534.189] ON THAT PLAY.
[ct=4535.252] THEY SQUEEZED THE
[ct=4537.076] SPACE OUT OF THAT
[ct=4540.184] >> Al: GOFF FIRES, AND
[ct=4541.868] THAT’S NOT CAUGHT.
[ct=4544.259] LAPORTA TRYING TO HAUL
[ct=4545.664] IT IN AT THE 43 YARD
[ct=4546.663] LINE AND COULD NOT.
[ct=4551.167] MANNED COVERAGE.
[ct=4553.260] ANY TIME YOU GET THAT
[ct=4553.875] KIND OF MANNED
[ct=4554.654] COVERAGE, YOU LIKE TO
[ct=4555.416] WORK ACROSS.
[ct=4556.403] WORK TO THE MIDDLE
[ct=4557.166] WHETHER IT’S A MESH
[ct=4558.187] CONCEPT AND CROSSERS.
[ct=4560.860] GOT TO THE TOP OF THAT
[ct=4562.858] ROUTE, GETS OFF AWAY
[ct=4566.860] FROM ERIC STOKES AND
[ct=4567.645] JUST NOT ABLE TO HOLD
[ct=4568.378] ONTO THAT FOOTBALL.
[ct=4569.222] LOOKS LIKE A REFEREE
[ct=4572.275] MAY BE DOWN.
[ct=4572.548] >> Al: OH, YEAH.
[ct=4579.265] SO ONE OF THE
[ct=4580.867] OFFICIALS NEEDS A
[ct=4582.665] MOMENT.
[ct=4584.045] THAT’S KARL JOHNSON
[ct=4584.567] WHO AT ONE TIME WAS
[ct=4586.134] THE HEAD OF OFFICIALS
[ct=4586.989] FOR THE NFL, AND THEN
[ct=4588.217] HE DECIDED I WANT TO
[ct=4593.171] COME BACK OUT ONTO THE
[ct=4597.718] AND HE’S A GOOD MAN.
[ct=4601.861] HAPPY TO SEE HIM GET
[ct=4603.567] UP MAYBE A MOMENT OR
[ct=4604.025] TWO HERE.
[ct=4604.918] AND WE’LL TAKE A
[ct=4610.044] MOMENT OR TWO OFF.
[ct=4610.609] ENAGBARE WAS THE GUY
[ct=4611.632] WHO ACCIDENTLY RAN
[ct=4613.033] INTO HIM.
[ct=4616.915] IT’S THE SHOULDER.
[ct=4618.313] THEY’VE TAKEN HIM BACK
[ct=4618.614] TO THE OFFICIAL LOCKER
[ct=4619.041] ROOM, WHICH MEANS YOUR
[ct=4619.757] DOWN FROM SEVEN
[ct=4620.793] TERRY, WHAT IS THE
[ct=4621.669] LOCATION NOW?
[ct=4622.659] HE’S THE LINE JUDGE.
[ct=4623.664] >> THEY’LL ONLY HAVE
[ct=4625.469] ONE OFFICIAL ON GREEN
[ct=4626.068] BAY’S SIDELINE.
[ct=4626.870] HE’LL ADJUST HIMSELF
[ct=4628.780] DEPENDING ON DOWN AND
[ct=4630.308] DISTANCE.
[ct=4630.684] >> Al: HOPING HE CAN
[ct=4631.746] GET BACK IN HERE AS
[ct=4633.100] THEY EXAMINE HIM.
[ct=4633.773] IN THE OFFICIAL’S
[ct=4638.699] MEANWHILE, A QUICK
[ct=4638.998] PASS HERE CAUGHT BY
[ct=4641.533] AND WILLIAMS IS OUT TO
[ct=4642.500] THE 40 YARD LINE,
[ct=4643.764] TACKLE THERE BY KENNY
[ct=4645.218] CLARK.
[ct=4646.809] THAT WAS A 3rd AND 8.
[ct=4648.349] NOW YOU’VE GOT A 4th
[ct=4650.961] AND 1 AT MIDFIELD.
[ct=4651.413] >> Kirk: BIG THING
[ct=4652.498] RECOGNIZE IS SPOTTING
[ct=4654.160] INSTEAD OF HAVING TWO
[ct=4655.141] OFFICIALS THAT CAN
[ct=4656.506] COME IN ONE FROM ONE
[ct=4657.769] SIDELINE, ONE FROM THE
[ct=4658.748] OTHER, IT’S ONLY
[ct=4659.745] COMING FROM THE NEAR
[ct=4661.359] SIDELINE NOW, THE
[ct=4664.394] DETOIT SIDE

[ct=4668.524] AND 1.
[ct=4670.068] THEY LINE UP TO GO FOR
[ct=4671.765] HE’LL KEEP IT
[ct=4676.858] GOFF TAKES IT TO THE
[ct=4680.398] 49 BEHIND RAGNOW.
[ct=4686.267] >> Kirk: NICE, EASY,
[ct=4687.634] SAFE CALL UNDER
[ct=4687.634] CENTER.
[ct=4688.241] REMEMBER WHEN PEOPLE
[ct=4688.650] USED TO DO THIS
[ct=4690.577] INSTEAD OF SHOTGUN ON
[ct=4692.935] 4th AND 1?
[ct=4694.308] IT’S PRETTY EFFECTIVE.
[ct=4695.533] YOU GET UNDER CENTER,
[ct=4698.068] YOU JUST QUARTERBACK
[ct=4698.068] SNEAK.
[ct=4699.195] DOESN’T IT WORRY YOU
[ct=4700.287] YOU WATCH A GAME AND
[ct=4701.737] SEE SHOUT GUN ON 4th
[ct=4703.214] SEE IT ALL OVER
[ct=4705.651] COLLEGE FOOTBALL.
[ct=4705.651] >> Al: EXCEPT IN
[ct=4706.350] PHILADELPHIA.
[ct=4710.043] >> Kirk: NEVER SEE IT.
[ct=4710.310] PLAY FAKE.
[ct=4711.977] SCREEN SETUP.
[ct=4713.997] NICE LOOKING PLAY.
[ct=4715.659] AND A 13-YARD PICKUP

[ct=4720.213] BEAUTIFULLY SETUP.
[ct=4721.884] HAD A FULL CONVOY,
[ct=4723.206] PICKS UP 13.
[ct=4726.424] ARE A GREAT STREAM
[ct=4726.424] TEAM.
[ct=4727.901] THEY JUST HAVE A SENSE
[ct=4728.679] OF WHEN TO START GOING
[ct=4731.375] TO THESE RPOs IN A
[ct=4733.026] STREAM GAME.
[ct=4733.930] GOOD JOB, LOOK AT THE
[ct=4734.814] LINEMEN DOWNFIELD.
[ct=4736.131] THE TIMING OF IT
[ct=4736.859] PERFECT WHETHER IT’S
[ct=4738.906] GIBBS OR MONTGOMERY.
[ct=4739.790] REALLY GOOD JOB OF
[ct=4740.411] LOOKING THAT OFF AND
[ct=4742.318] THEN DUMPING IT DOWN.
[ct=4743.202] AND AGAIN, THE ROOM TO
[ct=4745.851] FOR THAT FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4753.505] >> Al: ROLLING,
[ct=4757.063] LOOKING, KEEPING.
[ct=4757.877] GAINS 8.
[ct=4759.952] JARED GOFF ON THE
[ct=4760.428] MOVE.
[ct=4761.718] HE’S A POCKET
[ct=4763.594] QUARTERBACK, BUT THEY
[ct=4765.267] GO SO MUCH PLAY
[ct=4767.077] WAGGLES AND BOOTS,
[ct=4767.575] THAT IF YOU’RE GOING
[ct=4770.355] TO BE SO CONCERNED
[ct=4771.089] ABOUT WHAT’S
[ct=4771.414] DOWNFIELD, YOU’RE NOT
[ct=4772.482] GOING TO THINK ABOUT
[ct=4773.384] HIM TAKING OFF AND
[ct=4775.106] GOING, THEN HE’S
[ct=4776.474] EASILY GOING TO EAT UP
[ct=4776.931] THAT SPACE.
[ct=4777.913] I MEAN THERE IS
[ct=4778.388] NOTHING BUT GRASS
[ct=4779.592] THERE, AND HE TAKES
[ct=4783.099] 8 OR 9 YARDS.
[ct=4784.690] >> Al: 2nd AND 1.
[ct=4786.182] HALFWAY THROUGH THE
[ct=4786.464] THIRD QUARTER.
[ct=4795.677] EASY YARD.
[ct=4797.627] GETS THAT, AND A LOT
[ct=4798.019] MORE!
[ct=4803.347] DOWN THE SIDELINE GOES
[ct=4807.938] >> Kirk: KARL BROOKS
[ct=4809.005] ALMOST TOOK HIS
[ct=4809.867] HAND-OFF.
[ct=4810.610] 94 RIGHT HERE.
[ct=4813.325] THEY TALK ABOUT HOW HE
[ct=4813.725] HAS TWITCH.
[ct=4815.852] WHAT A GOOD GET OFF.
[ct=4817.540] GOFF, HE SHOULD HAVE
[ct=4818.761] GONE FOR THE BACK,
[ct=4819.693] BLOWN THAT PLAY UP.
[ct=4820.818] HE JUST GETS AN ARM ON
[ct=4821.940] GOOD JOB OF HOLDING
[ct=4823.345] ONTO THE FOOTBALL, AND
[ct=4823.810] THERE’S THAT
[ct=4825.188] ACCELERATION.
[ct=4825.760] IT’S AS GOOD AS
[ct=4827.632] ANYBODY IN THE NFL
[ct=4831.147] FROM JAHMYR GIBBS.
[ct=4831.348] >> Al: SO 1st AND
[ct=4832.984] GIBBS HAS NOW GONE
[ct=4834.652] OVER 1,000 YARDS FOR
[ct=4837.290] JACOBS DID IT FOR
[ct=4838.172] GREEN BAY EARLIER IN
[ct=4839.444] THE GAME.
[ct=4841.157] STRAIGHT DROP.
[ct=4842.573] AND THEN THROWN WAY
[ct=4848.514] OUT OF THE END ZONE.
[ct=4852.074] LaPORTA-WELL COVERED.
[ct=4853.694] >> Kirk: THEY TALKED
[ct=4855.533] ABOUT RED ZONE,
[ct=4856.408] THEY’RE SIXTH IN THE
[ct=4856.903] NFL.
[ct=4858.475] LAST WEEK 205 TO GO
[ct=4859.148] ALL THE WAY BACK TO
[ct=4862.021] THE TAMPA GAME 1-7.
[ct=4864.003] THEY DIDN’T HAD A
[ct=4865.225] HANDFUL OF GAMES WHERE
[ct=4865.778] IT’S NOT CLICKED.
[ct=4867.131] IN A GAME YOU START TO
[ct=4868.011] FEEL NOW, THESE
[ct=4868.960] QUARTERBACKS ARE
[ct=4869.995] STARTING TO WARM UP,
[ct=4870.701] THESE POINTS GOING TO
[ct=4871.933] BE REALLY IMPORTANT.
[ct=4876.023] WHERE HE TRIES TO FIND
[ct=4877.320] THIS MATCHUP.
[ct=4877.678] YOU MENTIONED ST.
[ct=4879.914] WE’VE NOT SEEN HIM GET
[ct=4880.380] MANY OPPORTUNITIES,
[ct=4881.103] AND THERE HE IS IN
[ct=4883.313] >> Al: HE’S CAUGHT
[ct=4888.687] THREE TONIGHT FOR 68
[ct=4890.656] THERE GOES GIBBS TO
[ct=4896.501] HE TAKES McDUFFIE DOWN
[ct=4897.238] AND 3rd AND GOAL.
[ct=4897.963] >> Kirk: REMEMBER THEY
[ct=4898.608] WERE DOWN HERE AND GOT
[ct=4899.767] ALL THE WAY DOWN RIGHT
[ct=4901.224] BEFORE THE HALF, AND
[ct=4902.232] WE THOUGHT WHERE ARE
[ct=4903.348] THEY GOING TO TRY TO
[ct=4904.262] FIND A MATCHUP?
[ct=4905.864] THEY ENDED UP GOING TO
[ct=4906.370] GIBBS WHO WAS
[ct=4907.422] ONE-ON-ONE AGAINST A
[ct=4908.459] LINEBACKER.
[ct=4909.235] IT WAS A MISMATCH
[ct=4911.709] AGAINST McDUFFIE.
[ct=4912.249] >> Al: AND IT PAID OFF
[ct=4915.144] WITH A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=4920.750] 3rd AND GOAL.
[ct=4921.029] SACKED THREE RECEIVERS
[ct=4922.061] TO THE LEFT.
[ct=4923.533] AND WE’RE GOING TO
[ct=4925.160] HAVE A 4th DOWN FROM
[ct=4926.298] ABOUT THE 2 YARD LINE
[ct=4927.098] AS GIBBS TAKES IT
[ct=4928.071] MAYBE A YARD.
[ct=4930.841] SO 4th AND GOAL.
[ct=4932.558] >> Kirk: YOU KNOW THEY
[ct=4933.891] RAMMED THAT PLAY TO
[ct=4937.080] GET READY FOR THIS 4th
[ct=4937.692] DOWN CALL.
[ct=4938.697] AND CAMPBELL HAS A
[ct=4939.522] VERY AGGRESSIVE
[ct=4941.969] APPROACH TO THESE PLAY
[ct=4945.935] THOSE LINEBACKERS GOT
[ct=4946.868] DOWNHILL IN A HURRY
[ct=4948.060] THAT PLAY REALLY
[ct=4950.133] DIDN’T HAVE MUCH OF A
[ct=4950.367] CHANCE TO GET INTO THE
[ct=4950.619] END ZONE.
[ct=4953.644] ALL THE WAY DOWN THE 3
[ct=4953.967] YARD LINE HERE ON 4th
[ct=4958.221] >> Al: ST. BROWN IS IN
[ct=4959.611] THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=4960.667] THE PASS IS CAUGHT FOR
[ct=4969.645] THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=4971.254] CEN PATRICK!
[ct=4974.194] >> Kirk: WE SAW GREEN
[ct=4974.738] BAY SCORE A TOUCHDOWN
[ct=4975.052] WITH TEMPO.
[ct=4976.186] LOOK AT THE GREEN BAY
[ct=4979.425] JUST LIKE DETROIT,
[ct=4980.085] MIDDLE LINEBACKER
[ct=4982.480] EVERYBODY LINED UP, A
[ct=4983.481] LOT OF CONFUSION AND
[ct=4984.887] AN EASY READ FOR GOFF
[ct=4985.969] ON THAT TOUCHDOWN TO
[ct=4988.257] >> Al: IT’S REALLY
[ct=4989.712] GREAT TO SEE THIS GUY
[ct=4991.318] HE MISSED TWO FULL
[ct=4993.005] SEASONS, HAD A COUPLE
[ct=4994.626] OF SURGERIES.
[ct=4995.939] LOOKED LIKE HIS CAREER
[ct=4995.939] MAY BE OVER.
[ct=4997.621] GREAT PLAYER IN
[ct=4998.701] DENVER, COMES HERE.
[ct=4999.874] FIRST TD FOR HIM SINCE
[ct=5001.978] 2021.
[ct=5004.499] EXTRA POINT BY BATES
[ct=5007.838] GO.
[ct=5008.344] GREEN BAY TOOK THE
[ct=5009.449] LEAD, NOW DETROIT HAS
[ct=5011.312] IT BACK.
[ct=5012.273] 24-21 ON THURSDAY
[ct=5014.008] NIGHT FOOTBALL.
[ct=5018.274] OF OFFICIALS FOR A
[ct=5019.636] COUPLE OF YEARS, BUT
[ct=5021.775] MISSED THE ACTION.
[ct=5023.006] WANTED TO GET BACK TO
[ct=5024.329] WORK IN THESE GAMES,
[ct=5025.850] AND WE’VE SEEN HIM A
[ct=5028.281] LOT ON THE JOHN HUSSEY
[ct=5029.712] CREW.
[ct=5030.171] MEANWHILE YOU’VE GOT
[ct=5030.442] THE KICK OFF HERE AND
[ct=5031.946] THE TOUCH BACK THERE.
[ct=5034.592] >> Kirk: NICE TOUCH BY
[ct=5034.592] JARED GOFF AFTER THAT
[ct=5036.967] THE BALL IS ON THE
[ct=5038.564] GROUND, EXCITED.
[ct=5039.273] DPAUF WITH PRESENCE OF
[ct=5042.339] MIND THINKING, HEY, MY
[ct=5043.105] GUY HADN’T SCORED A
[ct=5044.096] WHILE.
[ct=5046.712] I THINK I’M GOING TO
[ct=5047.230] TAKE THIS ONE OVER TO
[ct=5050.656] MY GUY TIM PATRICK.
[ct=5051.427] >> Al: HE’S A REALLY
[ct=5052.923] SOLID GUY AND MEANS SO
[ct=5055.442] MUCH IN THAT WIDE
[ct=5056.638] RECEIVER ROOM.
[ct=5059.173] >> Kirk: TALKED TO
[ct=5062.365] ANTWAAN BEFORE THE
[ct=5064.451] GAME AND SAID HE’S A
[ct=5065.694] GREAT RECEIVERS COACH.
[ct=5067.183] AND REALLY SET THE
[ct=5067.768] TONE IN THAT ROOM
[ct=5068.904] HELPING OUT ST. BROWN
[ct=5070.870] AND OTHERS.
[ct=5071.842] >> Al: SO NOW GREEN
[ct=5073.067] TWO QUICK TOUCH DOWNS
[ct=5074.538] TO START THE QUARTER.
[ct=5076.106] WHAT ARE THEY DOING
[ct=5076.414] HERE?
[ct=5079.578] GOT A LITTLE
[ct=5082.303] FLEAFLICKER AND LOVE
[ct=5082.554] PUMPS, THROW.
[ct=5083.835] A LOT 06 NOTHING FOR
[ct=5086.040] ALL OF THAT ACTION.
[ct=5086.816] >> Kirk: YEAH, HE HAD
[ct=5087.789] A CHANCE IF HE HAD
[ct=5089.088] BUT ONCE AGAIN THESE
[ct=5090.225] GUYS, YOU KNOW, THEY
[ct=5091.096] JUST GOT HERE.
[ct=5093.992] THIS WAS MYLES ADAMS
[ct=5095.224] WHO’S JUST RECENTLY
[ct=5095.698] BEEN SIGNED.
[ct=5096.524] HE’S UP THERE LINED UP
[ct=5097.616] AT THE NOSE.
[ct=5098.412] THIS PLAY TAKES A
[ct=5100.527] LITTLE BIT OF TIME.
[ct=5100.711] SEE PRESSURE RIGHT
[ct=5101.756] THERE COMING THROUGH
[ct=5105.306] THE TIGHT END, BEN
[ct=5106.822] SIMS.
[ct=5107.054] HE’S LUCKY TO KEEP HIS
[ct=5109.224] FEET, BUT HE HAD OPEN
[ct=5112.119] RECEIVERS DOWNFIELD.
[ct=5121.682] JACOBS AND BROOKS TO
[ct=5126.056] GIVEN TO JAKEBS WHO’S
[ct=5129.891] FOLLOWING BROOKS.
[ct=5133.318] TACKLED BY BRODRIC
[ct=5136.317] MARTIN, 3rd AND LONG.
[ct=5136.614] >> Kirk: THEY HAD
[ct=5136.928] EVERYBODY WALKED UP
[ct=5137.735] CLOSE, HAD EIGHT UP
[ct=5138.538] CLOSE TO THE LINE OF
[ct=5140.508] WITHIN 2 OR 3 YARDS,
[ct=5141.817] THEY STILL TRIED TO
[ct=5143.342] RUN INTO THAT AARON
[ct=5149.674] GLENN DEFENSE.
[ct=5151.759] INDEED.
[ct=5159.655] 3rd AND 8.
[ct=5161.321] >> Kirk: SEE SOME OF
[ct=5162.263] THE CONFUSION THERE
[ct=5162.708] WITH SOME OF THE NEWER
[ct=5164.198] FACES.
[ct=5165.386] >> Al: CLAP, CLAP,
[ct=5167.337] CLAPPING.
[ct=5167.337] GREEN BAY TRYING TO
[ct=5168.052] GET A CALL HERE.
[ct=5169.006] DETROIT’S TRYING TO
[ct=5171.932] FIGURE OUT WHAT’S
[ct=5172.157] GOING ON AND GREEN BAY
[ct=5172.534] TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
[ct=5173.510] WHAT’S GOING ON.
[ct=5176.278] >> Kirk: HE DID GET
[ct=5177.836] THE TIMEOUT, OKAY.
[ct=5178.992] FLAG CAME OUT, AND HE
[ct=5182.347] JUST GOT THE TIMEOUT.
[ct=5182.615] YOU’RE RIGHT, WE SAW
[ct=5184.425] MOVEMENT ON ONE SIDE
[ct=5186.458] AND CONFUSION ON GREEN
[ct=5188.519] THIS IS PRETTY BIG
[ct=5191.175] LOVE DID NOT WANT TO
[ct=5195.368] HAVE TO USE ONE OF
[ct=5195.368] THESE TIMEOUTS BUT
[ct=5196.053] REALLY FORCED TO
[ct=5198.751] >> Al: YEAH, NOT IN A
[ct=5199.244] GAME LIKE THIS.
[ct=5200.213] THAT COULD COME BACK
[ct=5201.219] TO BITE YOU AT THE
[ct=5201.967] END.
[ct=5211.438] 3rd AND 9.
[ct=5220.939] IT’S BLOCKED WELL.
[ct=5224.282] THE PASS IS GOING TO
[ct=5225.622] BE HAULED IN BY
[ct=5226.484] CHRISTIAN WATSON, BUT
[ct=5227.671] SHORT OF THE FIRST
[ct=5230.557] ROOKIE ARNOLD MAKES A
[ct=5231.814] CAMPBELL PUT THE
[ct=5232.427] PRESSURE ON.
[ct=5234.129] 4th AND 3.
[ct=5236.089] YOU, IF DETROIT WINS
[ct=5237.552] THIS GAME PAT
[ct=5240.001] O’CONNOR, 95, HE’S
[ct=5240.481] GOING TO GET A GAME
[ct=5243.477] WITH D.J. READER, NOW
[ct=5244.092] McNEILL OUT IN THE
[ct=5245.865] MIDDLE, THAT’S A REAL
[ct=5246.725] STRENGTH.
[ct=5247.109] IT’S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT
[ct=5248.029] GETTING THE SACK.
[ct=5248.872] IT’S ABOUT GETTING OFF
[ct=5252.078] HERE HE IS IN THE
[ct=5252.885] MIDDLE, MATCHED UP
[ct=5254.435] ONE-ON-ONE WITH JOSH
[ct=5256.103] MYERS.
[ct=5256.612] DOES ENOUGH HERE TO BE
[ct=5257.232] ABLE TO PUSH AND GET
[ct=5258.497] IN THE FACE TO GET
[ct=5259.059] THAT BALL OUT SOONER
[ct=5261.891] THAN HE WANTED.
[ct=5261.891] >> Al: EASTERN
[ct=5263.996] MICHIGAN PRODUCT.
[ct=5264.342] MEANWHILE, FAIR CATCH
[ct=5266.077] CALLED FOR MADE AT THE
[ct=5267.196] 21 YARD LINE.
[ct=5268.279] DETROIT WITH THE BALL,
[ct=5269.391] APPRECIATE, LET’S JUST
[ct=5271.865] SETTLE DOWN.
[ct=5273.309] >> Al: OFFENSIVE WORD.
[ct=5273.561] START THIS DRIVE FROM
[ct=5275.359] THE 22 YARD LINE.
[ct=5276.013] MONTGOMERY IS THE
[ct=5285.311] CHECK IT DOWN.
[ct=5287.167] AND HE GETS GANG
[ct=5287.553] TACKLED AFTER A GAIN
[ct=5288.385] OF A COUPLE.
[ct=5289.960] NIXON THE FIRST GUY
[ct=5293.201] 2nd DOWN AND 7.
[ct=5293.438] >> Kirk: JUST LIKE TO
[ct=5294.435] NOTE THAT ST. BROWN
[ct=5296.281] HAS NOT BEEN INVOLVED
[ct=5297.532] A LOT TONIGHT IN
[ct=5298.462] GETTING CHANCES.
[ct=5299.398] FOUR TARGETS, THREE
[ct=5302.766] CATCHES, ONLY 16
[ct=5304.364] ONE OF THE TOP
[ct=5304.678] RECEIVERS IN THE NFL.
[ct=5305.919] YOU KNOW WHAT?
[ct=5306.579] HE’S NOT OUT THERE
[ct=5307.770] MOPING.
[ct=5308.745] HE’S NOT COMPLAINING.
[ct=5309.735] HE’S OUT THERE
[ct=5312.876] BLOCKING HIS ASS OFF
[ct=5314.044] AND JUST BEING A GREAT
[ct=5315.511] TEAMMATE.
[ct=5316.321] HIS TIME WILL COME AT
[ct=5318.797] SOME POINT TONIGHT.
[ct=5318.797] >> Al: CAUGHT 79 IN
[ct=5320.570] RUNNING INTO A WALL
[ct=5320.922] THAT TIME IS
[ct=5323.111] SO IT’LL BE 3rd DOWN
[ct=5324.171] AND ABOUT 6.
[ct=5325.267] >> Kirk: YOU KNOW, AT
[ct=5327.389] SOME POINT HE’LL GET A
[ct=5327.803] ONE-ON-ONE MATCHUP,
[ct=5329.000] AND IT’S JUST GREAT TO
[ct=5330.730] SEE GOFF DOESN’T FEEL
[ct=5332.095] HE HAS TO FORCE THE
[ct=5332.718] BALL TO HIS GUY.
[ct=5333.982] NOBODY WANTS TO GET
[ct=5336.249] THE BALL MORE TO ST.
[ct=5336.844] BROWN THAN GOFF.
[ct=5338.331] BUT THE MATCHUPS RIGHT
[ct=5340.150] NOW HAVE NOT ALLOWED
[ct=5340.661] FOR THAT TO HAPPE
[ct=5341.719] BUT IT WILL.
[ct=5342.196] AND THE FACT HE’S NOT
[ct=5343.150] FORCING IT AND THE
[ct=5344.440] FACT ST. BROWN IS JUST
[ct=5346.136] DOING HIS JOB, IT’S
[ct=5349.213] REFRESHING TO SEE.
[ct=5353.334] >> Al: 3rd AND 6.
[ct=5355.022] WILLIAMS MOVING.
[ct=5356.571] GOFF OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=5356.952] GOFF FIRES, AND THAT’S
[ct=5358.222] GOING TO BE CAUGHT.
[ct=5360.051] IS IT A FIRST DOWN?
[ct=5360.956] THAT’S PATRICK MAKING
[ct=5361.941] THE GRAB, BUT IT’S
[ct=5364.010] GOING TO BE MARKED A
[ct=5364.986] YARD SHY.
[ct=5367.297] SO WITH UNDER 2:00 TO
[ct=5368.592] PLAY IN THE QUARTER,
[ct=5371.625] 4th DOWN, 4th AND 1.
[ct=5372.257] YOUR OWN 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=5373.654] WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
[ct=5374.432] DO?
[ct=5375.321] >> Kirk: YEAH, AND DAN
[ct=5376.118] CAMPBELL HAS A
[ct=5376.837] REPUTATION OF GOING
[ct=5377.717] FOR IT.
[ct=5378.297] HE’S DONE IT THREE
[ct=5381.210] TIMES TONIGHT.
[ct=5381.475] HE’S MADE ALL THREE.
[ct=5382.458] BUT HERE THEY ARE DEEP
[ct=5382.958] IN THEIR OWN
[ct=5386.251] IT’S A BIG ONE.
[ct=5389.366] >> Al: THREE OUT OF
[ct=5389.972] THREE.
[ct=5391.194] CAN THEY MAKE IT FOUR
[ct=5392.806] OUT OF FOUR OR GIVE IT
[ct=5394.677] TO GREEN BAY?
[ct=5396.128] TO THE OUTSIDE, TURNS
[ct=5397.998] NO, GREEN BAY STUFFS
[ct=5398.421] THEM.
[ct=5399.284] GIBBS TAKEN DOWN, AND
[ct=5400.446] THE PACKERS ARE GOING
[ct=5401.809] TO GET IT AT ABOUT THE
[ct=5404.492] 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=5407.567] >> Kirk: WHAT’S
[ct=5408.722] INTERESTING TEE
[ct=5409.405] INTERESTING TO ME, AL,
[ct=5410.543] IS GOFF HAS HAD
[ct=5411.402] OPPORTUNITY TO SNEAK
[ct=5412.960] LOOK AT THE GAP HERE,
[ct=5414.177] HE MAKES A CALL, CAN,
[ct=5415.605] CAN, CAN.
[ct=5417.746] THEY’RE GOING TO MAKE
[ct=5418.708] A SWEEP TO GET TO THE
[ct=5419.338] OUTSIDE, BUT LOOK AT
[ct=5419.562] THE REACTION FROM THIS
[ct=5421.476] THEY ARE FLYING.
[ct=5422.326] THEY KNOW THE
[ct=5423.125] OPPORTUNITY THEY HAVE.
[ct=5424.445] SECONDARY COMING UP,
[ct=5426.112] THAT WAS BULLARD, AND
[ct=5427.665] EVENTUALLY QUAY WALKER
[ct=5428.551] MAKES THE PLAY TO KEEP
[ct=5429.256] HIM SHORT OF THAT
[ct=5430.976] GREAT PLAY BY THAT
[ct=5433.927] >> Al: SO A 1:30 TO GO
[ct=5436.956] IN THE THIRD.
[ct=5438.472] THREE-POINT GAME.
[ct=5439.619] DETROIT ON TOP.
[ct=5440.892] LIONS TRYING TO WIN 11
[ct=5442.243] STRAIGHT.
[ct=5443.007] PACKERS TRYING TO AT
[ct=5443.863] LEAST KEEP PACE AND
[ct=5446.397] GET TO WITHIN A GAME
[ct=5447.205] OF THEM IN THE
[ct=5448.735] STANDINGS.
[ct=5450.914] A LOT AT STAKE
[ct=5452.376] REED IN MOTION,

[ct=5462.663] 3-YARD PICKUP.
[ct=5463.179] >> Kirk: YOU LOOK AT
[ct=5464.270] THAT DECISION, IT’S
[ct=5465.381] EASY TO SAY WHAT THE
[ct=5466.740] HECK IS HE DOING DEEP
[ct=5468.227] IN HIS OWN TERRITORY?
[ct=5469.126] BUT, LISTEN, YOU LIVE
[ct=5472.785] BY THE SWORD.
[ct=5473.578] WHEN IT WORKS AND THEY
[ct=5474.565] END UP GOING DOWN A
[ct=5475.599] LINK TO THE FIELD AND
[ct=5476.651] PUTTING POINTS ON THE

[ct=5486.851] HERE, BUT HE’S LIVING
[ct=5488.305] UP TO WHAT HE DOES.
[ct=5489.504] YOU CAN’T QUESTION IT
[ct=5490.654] WHEN HE DOES IT AND IT
[ct=5492.121] WORKS.
[ct=5493.746] >> Al: YEAH, A THIN
[ct=5494.289] LINE BETWEEN A GENIUS
[ct=5495.493] AND A BUM.
[ct=5496.288] MEANWHILE, FREE,
[ct=5498.660] JUGGLES, MAKES THE
[ct=5499.386] CATCH.
[ct=5500.163] WHAT A POPPY, LOOK AT
[ct=5502.674] THE WAY HE GETS UP,

[ct=5503.986] GRAB, HIT BY JACK

[ct=5518.105] ALEXANDER.
[ct=5518.105] AND THIS TIME THAT
[ct=5519.024] DEFENSE BROUGHT A LOT
[ct=5521.228] OF PRESSURE.
[ct=5521.934] NOBODY OF THAT SECOND
[ct=5523.270] LEVEL OF THE DEFENSE.
[ct=5524.003] AGAIN, THIS GUY MAKING
[ct=5525.087] A PLAY.
[ct=5525.924] THAT’S 260 POUNDS
[ct=5527.072] MOVING AROUND LIKE
[ct=5528.867] >> Al: THAT’S A GOLD
[ct=5530.534] MEDAL IN THE OLYMPICS
[ct=5530.928] WHEN YOU PULL THAT
[ct=5534.069] CLOCK TICKING DOWN TO
[ct=5534.544] THE END OF THE
[ct=5536.010] DON’T HAVE TO RUN A
[ct=5538.187] AND THEY DON’T.
[ct=5538.629] THAT’S THE END OF THE
[ct=5541.154] TRYING TO GET HIM TO
[ct=5543.169] JUMP OFFSIDE.
[ct=5545.372] HERBSTREIT, KAYLEE
[ct=5546.372] HARTUNG.
[ct=5547.743] 3-POINT GAME.
[ct=5548.494] DETROIT HAS THE LEAD,
[ct=5549.722] BUT THE PACKERS FOR A
[ct=5557.155] 1st AND GOAL AT THE 6.
[ct=5559.406] CROWD FULL VOLUME.
[ct=5571.027] JACOBS IS THE BACK.
[ct=5571.596] SIMS SETS UP IN THE

[ct=5579.660] SURVEYING, HAS TIME,

[ct=5582.762] AND THAT WAS VINCE
[ct=5584.544] SIMS, NUMBER 2 TIGHT
[ct=5586.280] END WHO HAD SETUP IN
[ct=5588.201] THE BACK FIELD.
[ct=5589.895] RUNS A ROUTE HERE.
[ct=5590.848] >> Kirk: LOVE THE
[ct=5592.732] NO PLAY ACTION THERE.
[ct=5593.743] AS EXPECTED OF JOSH
[ct=5594.981] THINK ABOUT THE
[ct=5597.220] SCORED 13 POINTS IN
[ct=5598.360] THE THIRD QUARTER, ON
[ct=5599.730] THE THIRD OF PUNCHING
[ct=5600.874] ANOTHER ONE IN, BUT
[ct=5601.589] THEY HAVEN’T REALLY
[ct=5602.462] HAD TO DRIVE THE
[ct=5603.189] LENGTH OF THE FIELD.
[ct=5604.474] THEY HAD THE BIG 50
[ct=5607.907] YARD PASS TO WATSON.
[ct=5608.657] AN INTERCEPTION GOT
[ct=5609.131] THEM AT THE PLUS 30,
[ct=5610.140] AND THEN THE STOPS ON
[ct=5611.678] DOWNS GETS THEM AT THE
[ct=5614.886] PLUS 30.
[ct=5616.458] >> Al: JACOBS IN
[ct=5617.969] THERE!
[ct=5618.347] TOUCHDOWN GREEN BAY.
[ct=5621.369] AND THEY HAVE THE LEAD
[ct=5623.930] FOLLOW MYERS AND
[ct=5625.084] JENKINS THE CENTER AND
[ct=5625.764] THE LEFT GUARD.
[ct=5626.819] AND BACK AND FORTH WE
[ct=5627.347] CONTINUE TO GO.
[ct=5628.740] >> Kirk: BOY, THIS IS
[ct=5629.065] A HECK OF A
[ct=5631.719] IT’S GOING TO BE A
[ct=5633.351] HECK OF A FINISH.
[ct=5634.356] WATCH THE RIGHT GUARD
[ct=5641.589] WHAT A BLOCK, HE
[ct=5642.770] DOESN’T NEED A LOT OF
[ct=5643.100] ROOM.
[ct=5644.454] ONCE HE GETS DOWNHILL
[ct=5645.034] WITH THE POWER HE HAS
[ct=5646.395] IN THOSE LEGS, NO
[ct=5647.062] CHANCE OF SLOWING HIM
[ct=5649.992] BOY, HE’S A GREAT A
[ct=5650.885] ADDITION TO THIS
[ct=5652.362] THAT’S HIS THIRD
[ct=5655.533] NIGHT, RIGHT?
[ct=5658.016] BRANDON McMANUS WITH
[ct=5659.776] THE EXTRA POINT.
[ct=5659.776] SO THEY TURN IT OVER
[ct=5662.142] ON DOWNS, AND IT’S A
[ct=5663.470] 30-YARD DRIVE.
[ct=5665.555] AND WE GO BACK TO
[ct=5667.596] CAMPBELL’S FOURTH
[ct=5668.621] DOWN-PLAY HERE.
[ct=5670.404] AGAIN COMING INTO THIS
[ct=5672.727] FOURTH DOWN, AND THIS
[ct=5673.847] ONE IS DEEP IN HIS OWN
[ct=5675.429] MADE THREE, AND
[ct=5677.801] INSTEAD OF THE SNEAK
[ct=5678.196] HE FELT THE PRESNAP
[ct=5678.904] THEY’D TAKEN THAT
[ct=5682.475] BUT THE PACKERS SPEED
[ct=5682.873] AND RECOGNITION OF
[ct=5683.895] THAT PERIMETER RUN
[ct=5684.662] GETS THE DEFENSE OFF
[ct=5685.070] THE FIELD.
[ct=5686.241] AND ONCE AGAIN NUMBER
[ct=5687.458] 8 FINDS THE END ZONE,
[ct=5688.419] AND THEY MAKE THE
[ct=5689.536] LIONS PAY FOR THAT
[ct=5690.865] DECISION TO GO FOR IT
[ct=5691.788] ON FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=5692.538] >> Al: YEAH, BIG STOP
[ct=5694.452] QUAY WALKER WAS THE
[ct=5698.059] FIRST GUY TO STOP HIM.
[ct=5699.109] THEN JOHNSON GOES I
[ct=5700.102] SHOULD HAVE CALLED
[ct=5701.657] SOMETHING ELSE.
[ct=5702.756] >> Kirk: WELL, WE’VE
[ct=5703.965] SEEN THEM RESPOND WHEN
[ct=5706.774] THEY’VE GOTTEN DOWN.
[ct=5707.892] CHAMPIONSHIP TEAMS DO.
[ct=5708.492] THESE TWO TEAMS ARE
[ct=5709.787] JUST GOING TO KEEP

[ct=5727.421] THEY’VE GOT BUFFALO

[ct=5757.281] DONE A VERY GOOD JOB.
[ct=5759.612] THIS JEFF HAFLEY
[ct=5760.278] DEFENSE NOT GIVING UP
[ct=5761.298] THOSE BIG PLAYS,
[ct=5762.496] EXPLOSIVE PLAYS.
[ct=5763.048] KEEP IN MIND THEY
[ct=5765.821] DON’T HAVE JAIRE
[ct=5766.973] ALEXANDER OUT THERE,
[ct=5768.431] AND THEY’VE PLAYED
[ct=5769.737] MORE ZONE THAN THEY
[ct=5771.342] WOULD LIKE TO.

[ct=5910.586] JUST TOO MUCH SPACE,
[ct=5911.480] WHETHER IT’S GIBBS OR
[ct=5911.663] MONTGOMERY SNEAKING
[ct=5912.901] OUT OF THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=5914.659] HERE HE’S MATCHED UP

[ct=5951.422] WITH THE PLAY ACTION
[ct=5951.834] MECHANICS.
[ct=5954.497] AND HE USED TO FILM
[ct=5955.106] HIMSELF FROM SO MANY
[ct=5956.061] DIFFERENT ANGLES AND
[ct=5956.817] WORK SO HARD TO MAKE
[ct=5957.594] THE UNDERNEATH CENTER
[ct=5959.168] HAND-OFF AND THE PLAY
[ct=5960.314] ACTION FAKE LOOK
[ct=5960.977] IDENTICAL, TO MAKE
[ct=5962.062] THOSE LINE BACKERS A
[ct=5963.373] LITTLE HESITANT NOT

[ct=6189.957] BUT JUST A DIFFERENT
[ct=6191.031] KIND OF RUNNER.

[ct=6193.018] PHYSICALITY, WHICH
[ct=6195.275] MATCHES THEIR PLAY
[ct=6195.497] ACTION GAME PERFECTLY.
[ct=6196.420] ESPECIALLY AS THE

[ct=6332.018] AARON GLENN WITH WHAT
[ct=6332.518] HE LIKES TO DO.
[ct=6333.128] AND EVEN WITH THOSE

[ct=6359.358] PERFECTLY.
[ct=6360.165] AND FOR WHATEVER
[ct=6362.370] REASON JACOBS MISSES
[ct=6363.866] THIS BLITZ PICKUP.

[ct=6404.999] WITH JACOBS HE’S GOING

[ct=6412.046] AND VISION TO CUT IT

[ct=6742.821] HOLD UP IS THESE GUYS
[ct=6743.549] THAT ARE IN COVERAGE
[ct=6745.556] AND PLAYING ALL YEAR.
[ct=6746.198] ARNOLD, DAVIS,

[ct=6781.114] WHICH WOULD TIE THE

[ct=6790.868] BACKERS ARE INJURED
[ct=6791.877] AND NOT PLAYING.
[ct=6792.999] YOU’VE GOT TO TURN TO
[ct=6795.154] A GUY LIKE EZEKIEL
[ct=6796.178] TURNER, WHO CAME OVER
[ct=6797.106] FROM SEATTLE OFF THE

[ct=6799.648] MAKES THIS PLAY IN
[ct=6802.111] SPACE AGAINST A VERY
[ct=6802.605] CAPABLE QUARTERBACK IN
[ct=6807.710] LATE BREAKING RECEIVER
[ct=6808.162] AS HE’S RUNNING FOR
[ct=6808.928] HIS LIFE.
[ct=6812.804] TOUGH TO SEE.
[ct=6815.261] >> Al: 32-YARD ATTEMPT
[ct=6817.656] FOR McMAN
[ct=6819.565] SPOT.
[ct=6819.803] >> Kirk: HE’S GOT TO
[ct=6821.866] BE HAPPY FOR
[ct=6825.550] MONTGOMERY JOINING
[ct=6828.011] SIMS WITH 12 RUSHING
[ct=6828.483] TOUCHDOWNS IN
[ct=6830.810] CONSECUTIVE SEASONS.
[ct=6831.653] RARE COMPANY FOR
[ct=6833.328] >> Al: SO THE LIONS
[ct=6837.729] WITH A GAME TIE 3:38.
[ct=6837.729] LOOKING DOWN THE
[ct=6840.536] STRETCH THE LIONS HAVE
[ct=6842.107] ALL THREE TIMEOUTS.
[ct=6843.135] AND JARED GOFF WILL GO
[ct=6845.622] TO WORK 27-36.
[ct=6849.153] SO HE’S 75%, 228
[ct=6852.266] ONLY TUA TAGOVAILOA
[ct=6853.791] HAS A BETTER
[ct=6854.081] COMPLETION PERCENTAGE
[ct=6855.157] THIS SEASON COMING
[ct=6856.554] INTO TONIGHT.
[ct=6861.357] FROM THE 30.
[ct=6865.719] RUNNING BACK IS GIBBS.
[ct=6869.715] CAUGHT ALONG THE
[ct=6875.581] GAIN OF 19.
[ct=6879.414] PLAYING VALENTINE INTO
[ct=6879.952] THIS CORNER ON THE
[ct=6882.077] DOESN’T DO A GREAT JOB
[ct=6883.645] OF SLOWING DOWN
[ct=6886.115] HE’S ABLE TO GET TO
[ct=6887.137] THAT SECOND LEVEL.
[ct=6888.363] HE’S JUST READING 24
[ct=6891.965] THERE, DECIDES TO GO
[ct=6892.494] UP AND OVER HIM, AND
[ct=6893.208] AN EASY COMPLETION TO
[ct=6895.601] GET THIS DRIVE
[ct=6895.601] STARTED.
[ct=6896.043] >> Al: FIVE CATCHES
[ct=6897.214] FOR WILLIAMS.
[ct=6898.665] 80 YARDS TONIGHT FROM
[ct=6901.662] THE 49.
[ct=6902.017] PLAY FAKE AGAIN.
[ct=6904.193] ROLLING, THROWING,
[ct=6905.879] HE’S FOUND HIS NEW MAN
[ct=6908.058] HERE, MR. TIM PATRICK.
[ct=6909.616] TWO TOUCHDOWNS,
[ct=6910.140] ANOTHER CATCH HERE.
[ct=6911.727] TIM PATRICK HAS NOW
[ct=6915.989] CAUGHT 6 ON 7 TARGETS.
[ct=6918.252] >> Kirk: HE’S IN A
[ct=6918.555] GOOD FLOW HERE TO
[ct=6918.885] START THIS DRIVE.
[ct=6919.904] THE REASON I’VE
[ct=6921.074] BROUGHT UP THAT WE’VE
[ct=6922.461] SEEN VALENTINE IN A
[ct=6923.536] CORNER IS BECAUSE THIS
[ct=6924.677] DEFENSIVE BACKFIELD AS
[ct=6925.501] THEY APPROACH THIS
[ct=6926.547] DRIVE, THEY’VE HAD TO
[ct=6928.717] SHIFT SOME GUYS
[ct=6929.833] EVAN WILLIAMS IS OUT
[ct=6930.405] OF THE GAME.
[ct=6932.221] BULLARD IS ALSO OUT OF
[ct=6933.240] THE GAME, SO YOU’VE
[ct=6935.516] HAD TO TAKE NIXON, 25,
[ct=6936.016] FROM OUTSIDE AS A
[ct=6937.895] CORNER, PUT HIM TO THE
[ct=6939.682] INSIDE TO TAKE OVER
[ct=6940.103] FOR BULLARD.
[ct=6940.670] SO WILLIAMS AND
[ct=6943.206] BULLARD OUT OF THERE.
[ct=6945.102] >> Al: YEAH, NIXON A
[ct=6946.344] BIG INTERCEPTION
[ct=6947.023] LEADING TO A TOUCHDOWN
[ct=6949.325] EARLIER.
[ct=6949.991] LITTLE TOSS BACK HERE.
[ct=6951.263] AND 1 OR 2 YARD GAIN
[ct=6952.592] FOR GIBBS INSIDE THE
[ct=6953.492] 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=6954.476] SECOND DOWN.
[ct=6955.996] >> Kirk: HE’S ONE OF
[ct=6957.952] THOSE YOUNG, DEFENSIVE
[ct=6958.436] ENDS THAT THEY’RE
[ct=6958.982] EXCITED ABOUT.
[ct=6960.551] THAT TIME IT WAS COX,
[ct=6962.886] BRENTON COX WHO FORCED
[ct=6965.274] THAT BALL BACK INSIDE.
[ct=6966.081] IF YOU’RE DETROIT 2:30
[ct=6967.195] TO GO, TIME IS NOT AN
[ct=6967.768] ISSUE.
[ct=6968.270] IN FACT, YOU’RE
[ct=6969.041] THINKING MORE ABOUT ON
[ct=6970.048] THE BACK END ABOUT THE
[ct=6974.052] DAN CAMPBELL SLOWING
[ct=6974.598] THE WHOLE OPERATION
[ct=6975.240] DOWN AFTER THOSE TWO
[ct=6976.592] BIG COMPLETIONS
[ct=6977.169] ALREADY IN PLUS
[ct=6982.560] >> Al: YEAH, TIME MAY
[ct=6983.014] BE MOEF OF AN
[ct=6984.469] BE MOEF RE OF AN ISSUE
[ct=6985.127] FOR GREEN BAY RIGHT
[ct=6988.700] BLITZ FROM THE CORNER.
[ct=6991.610] PASS TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=6993.559] SHORT GAIN HERE.
[ct=6994.126] >> Kirk: OH, SEPTEMBER
[ct=6996.533] THAT INTERESTING?
[ct=7000.711] 201 AND IT GOES OUT OF
[ct=7000.711] BOUNDS.
[ct=7001.808] AND SPEAK OF GREEN BAY
[ct=7002.747] HOPING FOR MORE TIME,
[ct=7005.357] THAT WAS A BIG PLAY TO
[ct=7009.366] GET GIBBS OUT OF
[ct=7010.703] >> Al: KARL JOHNSON
[ct=7011.390] WHO HAD TO COME OUT
[ct=7013.219] WITH A SHOULDER
[ct=7014.549] PROBLEM EARLIER, NOW
[ct=7018.005] GETTING AN EARFUL FROM
[ct=7020.925] LaFLEUR.
[ct=7024.081] >> Kirk: THE ONLY WAY
[ct=7025.184] YOU STOP GOFF ON THIS
[ct=7025.857] PLAY, YOU’VE GOT TO
[ct=7027.214] GET PRESSURE ON HIM.
[ct=7029.286] IF HE’S CLEAN, IT’S
[ct=7029.830] GOING TO BE A
[ct=7030.497] COMPLETION.
[ct=7031.166] >> Al: DUMPS IT OFF
[ct=7032.883] GIBBS LOOKING FOR THE
[ct=7034.910] FIRST DOWN, AND HAS
[ct=7036.194] ALMOST GOT PUSHED FROM
[ct=7039.904] BEHIND THAT TIME BY
[ct=7039.904] WYATT TO SECURE THE
[ct=7042.528] WITH 1:55 REMAINING.
[ct=7045.100] THIS IS THE 2-MINUTE
[ct=7055.469] >> Al: ALL RIGHT, SO
[ct=7057.153] IT’LL BE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=7057.889] MATT LaFLEUR STILL
[ct=7059.311] ARGUING.
[ct=7059.757] TRYING TO FIGURE IT
[ct=7061.667] BY THE CLOCK STOPPING
[ct=7063.242] AT 2:01 THAT WOULD
[ct=7064.389] WORK TO HIS BENEFIT.
[ct=7064.957] >> Kirk: NO DOUBT
[ct=7065.994] ABOUT IT.
[ct=7067.603] PROBABLY SOMETHING
[ct=7068.693] ELSE THAT’S IN PLAY
[ct=7069.893] >> Kirk: YEAH, HE WAS
[ct=7070.919] PRETTY FIRED UP THE
[ct=7072.008] ENTIRE TIME WE WERE
[ct=7073.679] >> Al: MEANWHILE, AS
[ct=7075.799] PLAY RESUMES, 1st AND
[ct=7079.653] 1:55.
[ct=7083.642] 31 YARD LINE.
[ct=7085.009] SETS IT UP TO
[ct=7087.519] STARTED TO SLIP.
[ct=7089.597] HOLDS ON, KEEPS HIS
[ct=7089.879] BALANCE.
[ct=7091.185] >> Kirk: LATE FLAG.
[ct=7092.108] >> Al: YEAH, LATE FLAG
[ct=7103.916] NIXON MAKING THE STOP.
[ct=7105.492] CROWD RESPONDING TO A
[ct=7106.375] REPLAY.
[ct=7112.105] BUT STILL NO ANSWER
[ct=7120.400] FROM SEAN HUSSEY.
[ct=7125.481] OFFENSE NUMBER 77.
[ct=7131.984] >> Al: IT’S UNDER
[ct=7133.783] FRANK RAGNOW.
[ct=7134.281] >> Kirk: IT’S AN
[ct=7134.796] INTERESTING CALL.
[ct=7135.680] IT WAS RIGHT AFTER HE
[ct=7136.438] SNAPPED
[ct=7139.692] TRIES TO GET OUT THERE
[ct=7141.279] TO HELP OUT ON THE --
[ct=7144.569] ON THE SCREEN.
[ct=7144.569] IT’S QUAY WALKER
[ct=7145.938] TRYING TO GET TO THE
[ct=7147.820] AND WE WERE
[ct=7149.968] FRAME-BY-FRAME THERE,
[ct=7150.806] AND I MEAN IF YOU DO
[ct=7151.535] THIS ON ALMOST EVERY
[ct=7153.645] PLAY, YOU CAN FIND
[ct=7155.038] SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
[ct=7155.811] >> Al: OH, FOR SURE.
[ct=7156.339] >> Kirk: SO NOW
[ct=7157.433] THEY’RE ALL THE WAY
[ct=7159.026] BACK TO THE 40 YARD
[ct=7161.201] WHAT A HUGE CALL.
[ct=7161.871] THEY WERE EASILY IN
[ct=7166.789] FIELD GOAL RANGE.
[ct=7167.926] >> Al: BATES JUST HAD
[ct=7169.233] A GREAT YEAR.
[ct=7171.888] READY TO BE CALLED ON.
[ct=7173.215] HE GOES FOR THE EXTRA
[ct=7173.215] POINT.
[ct=7175.577] 1st AND 20.
[ct=7184.023] PICKING UP ABOUT 3 IS
[ct=7187.615] DAVID MONTGOMERY.
[ct=7187.887] >> Kirk: THE LAST
[ct=7188.262] THING YOU WANT TO SEE
[ct=7190.997] IT AN UNNECESSARY
[ct=7193.303] PENTALTY FROM GREEN
[ct=7197.339] BAY, AND THAT TIME YOU
[ct=7198.945] SAW JUST JUMP ON THE
[ct=7199.288] PILE RIGHT IN THAT
[ct=7200.713] GRAY AREA.
[ct=7202.175] JUST GOT TO AVOID ANY
[ct=7202.623] MENTAL ERRORS IF
[ct=7207.753] YOU’RE GREEN BAY AND
[ct=7208.020] YOU’RE DESPERATELY
[ct=7209.064] THIS RANGE.
[ct=7212.050] >> Al: TAKE A TIMEOUT
[ct=7214.078] >> Kirk: WHISTLE HAD
[ct=7214.661] ALREADY BLOWN.
[ct=7215.039] SHOWING THAT ON THE
[ct=7215.522] BIG SCREEN.
[ct=7217.539] >> Al: THAT GETS THE
[ct=7217.897] RESPONSE.
[ct=7218.866] THAT GETS A RESPONSE
[ct=7220.183] FROM LaFLEUR AS WELL.
[ct=7221.486] >> Kirk: SO THEY’VE
[ct=7225.121] GOT ONE TIMEOUT LEF
[ct=7225.762] 1:42.
[ct=7226.232] DETROIT WANTS TO MAKE
[ct=7227.902] IT A LITTLE -- EVEN
[ct=7229.326] THOUGH THIS IS WITHIN
[ct=7230.427] BATES’ RANGE, YOU WANT
[ct=7231.775] TO STILL KIND OF BE
[ct=7232.378] AGGRESSIVE AND GIVE
[ct=7233.941] HIM A LITTLE BIT MORE
[ct=7234.410] OF A CUSHION.
[ct=7235.584] >> Al: FOR SURE.
[ct=7236.186] >> Kirk: GOT A COUPLE
[ct=7237.324] PLAYS HERE TO TRY TO
[ct=7239.231] DO THAT.
[ct=7242.411] >> Al: RIGHT NOW HE’D
[ct=7243.427] BE LOOKING AT A
[ct=7244.910] 55-YARD ATTEMPT.
[ct=7247.537] 2nd AND 17.
[ct=7249.415] GOFF, OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=7250.586] WIDE OPEN.
[ct=7252.578] OUTSIDE THE 20.
[ct=7256.322] ST. BROWN, HUGE PLAY.
[ct=7256.322] >> Kirk: WELL, YOU
[ct=7259.109] KNEW IT WAS COMING.
[ct=7260.556] ST. BROWN IS THE GUY.
[ct=7262.180] DAVID MONTGOMERY DOES
[ct=7262.858] HIS JOB.
[ct=7264.540] NOT ONLY IS HE SCORING
[ct=7265.628] TOUCHDOWNS TONIGHT, HE
[ct=7267.283] PICKS UP ISAIAH
[ct=7269.432] McDUFFIE WHO’S COMING
[ct=7270.277] ON THIS BLITZ.
[ct=7272.390] DOES A NICE JOB OF
[ct=7273.021] PICKING THAT UP.
[ct=7277.915] HOW OFTEN HAVE WE SEEN
[ct=7280.403] DETROIT -- BY THE WAY,
[ct=7281.956] McDUFFIE GOT UP AND
[ct=7282.600] GOT TO HIM.
[ct=7285.552] THAT CROSSER, THAT DIG
[ct=7289.180] LITTLE PUSH THERE.
[ct=7289.180] THAT’S WHAT NIXON WAS
[ct=7292.064] REACTING TO.
[ct=7292.064] BUT ST. BROWN GETS
[ct=7294.559] AWAY WITH IT.
[ct=7298.379] WATCH McDUFFIE GET UP
[ct=7298.745] AFTER GOING HEAD OVER
[ct=7302.958] HEELS.
[ct=7303.182] THEY FORCE GREEN BAY
[ct=7304.166] TO USE THAT LAST
[ct=7306.446] >> Al: THE FINAL ONE.
[ct=7308.272] NOW DETROIT CAN MILK
[ct=7309.320] THAT CLOCK.
[ct=7311.399] >> Kirk: WE SEE THAT
[ct=7313.612] FOLLOW THROUGH.
[ct=7314.507] THE RIGHT-HAND HITS
[ct=7316.048] THE HELMET OF
[ct=7319.291] >> Al: NOW THERE’S A
[ct=7319.668] QUESTION WHETHER HE
[ct=7321.655] GOT THE FIRST DOWN OR
[ct=7323.032] NOT.
[ct=7323.032] >> Referee: REPLAY
[ct=7323.665] CHANGES AS RESULT OF
[ct=7325.187] WE MUST RUN 10
[ct=7326.469] SECONDS.
[ct=7328.324] RESET THE GAME CLOCK
[ct=7329.763] FOR 1:37.
[ct=7330.706] BUT IN LIEU OF THE
[ct=7335.130] TO TAKE THEIR THIRD
[ct=7336.076] AND FINAL CHARGE
[ct=7341.807] >> Al: TERRY MACAULAY
[ct=7342.702] WHAT ARE YOU MAKING OF
[ct=7344.128] THIS?
[ct=7344.766] >> YEAH, THERE’S A LOT
[ct=7345.275] OF MISSED WORDS IN
[ct=7347.624] THAT ANNOUNCEMENT.
[ct=7347.624] IT’S ACTUALLY AN
[ct=7348.946] EXPEDITED REVIEW.
[ct=7349.396] HE DIDN’T MAKE THE
[ct=7350.077] LINE TO GAIN.
[ct=7351.230] IT DOES REQUIRE A
[ct=7352.379] 10-SECOND RUNOFF, BUT
[ct=7354.308] GREEN BAY HAD ALREADY
[ct=7356.302] USED THEIR TIMEOUT,
[ct=7356.302] WHICH THEY KEPT, WHICH
[ct=7357.796] THEY’RE GOING TO DO.
[ct=7361.395] IT’S NOW 3rd DOWN AND
[ct=7362.892] >> Kirk: AND THEY’RE
[ct=7364.443] OUT OF TIMEOUTS.
[ct=7364.662] >> Al: THEY’RE OUT OF
[ct=7366.057] TIMEOUTS, RIGHT.
[ct=7367.079] SO IF THEY PICK UP A
[ct=7369.664] FIRST DOWN HERE THEY
[ct=7371.803] CAN RUN THE CLOCK OUT
[ct=7372.048] AND KICK THE FIELD
[ct=7375.137] CAMPBELLS WANTS TO GET
[ct=7376.894] AN EXPLANATION.
[ct=7377.249] MEANWHILE, GOFF HAS
[ct=7378.579] COMPLETED HIS LAST 13
[ct=7379.213] PASSES.
[ct=7381.967] HE’S 32 OUT OF 41.
[ct=7383.333] 283 YARDS, 3
[ct=7387.738] TOUCHDOWNS TONIGHT.
[ct=7389.731] TWO TO PATRICK, ONE TO
[ct=7392.108] 3rd AND INCHES.
[ct=7397.701] AND DOES HE GET THE
[ct=7401.396] FIRST DOWN GREEN BAY,
[ct=7401.790] THINKS NOT.
[ct=7402.808] NO, HE DIDN’T.
[ct=7405.592] YOU’VE GOT ZAYNE
[ct=7406.463] ANDERSON WHO COMES UP,
[ct=7407.350] STOPS MONTGOMERY
[ct=7408.302] NOW, THIS IS
[ct=7410.761] FASCINATING DECISION.
[ct=7411.960] >> Kirk: HE’S DYING TO
[ct=7413.357] GO FOR IT, BUT
[ct=7413.895] OBVIOUSLY HE’S GOT TO
[ct=7414.804] KICK THIS FIELD GOAL
[ct=7416.442] TO POTENTIALLY WIN
[ct=7420.181] THIS GAME OR DARE AT
[ct=7422.085] LEAST GO AHEAD HERE BY
[ct=7424.067] >> Al: SO THIS WOULD
[ct=7425.509] BE ABOUT A 38-YARD
[ct=7427.197] YOU’RE ALMOST
[ct=7428.053] COMPELLED TO DO THAT.
[ct=7428.888] IF YOU DON’T MAKE IT
[ct=7430.516] AND GOT TO GIVE THE
[ct=7431.786] OTHER GUYS THE BALL,
[ct=7432.302] YOU’RE PROBABLY GOING
[ct=7433.201] OVERTIME.
[ct=7435.034] THE PLAY CLOCK IS DOWN
[ct=7439.338] AND STOP AT 2, 1,
[ct=7440.423] WHATEVER.
[ct=7441.572] 44 SECONDS, TIMEOUT,
[ct=7441.572] 43
[ct=7443.407] >> Kirk: IF YOU’RE A
[ct=7443.761] PACKERS FAN THE PLAY
[ct=7445.835] OF THE GAME BY ZAYNE
[ct=7446.530] ANDERSON WHO’S HAD TO
[ct=7447.696] STEP IN AT SAFETY.
[ct=7449.278] HE’S THE GUY THAT
[ct=7449.599] KNIFED IN THERE TO
[ct=7451.910] SUBMARINE THIS PLAY
[ct=7453.399] AND GIVE GREEN BAY
[ct=7453.993] SOME TIME.
[ct=7456.608] EVEN IF THIS FIELD
[ct=7457.457] GOAL IS GOOD, THEY
[ct=7458.551] STILL HAVE A SHOT NOW
[ct=7459.759] BECAUSE OF THIS EFFORT
[ct=7461.592] PLAY BY 39 TO MAKE
[ct=7462.610] THAT -- THAT’S A TOUGH
[ct=7465.222] MONTGOMERY, BUT A
[ct=7467.242] GREAT JOB BY ZAYNE
[ct=7467.546] ANDERSON ON THAT 3rd
[ct=7467.992] DOWN AND SHORT.
[ct=7470.006] THAT’S A HALF A YARD
[ct=7471.917] HE NEEDED.
[ct=7472.582] REMEMBER, IT TOOK A
[ct=7473.771] REVIEW FOR THAT TO
[ct=7475.772] THAT WAS A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=7477.109] THEY BROUGHT IT BACK A
[ct=7478.234] HALF YARD, AND THEN
[ct=7479.184] ANDERSON MAKES THAT
[ct=7480.282] THEY’RE GOING TO GET
[ct=7481.562] THE BALL BACK EVEN IF
[ct=7482.271] THIS IS GOOD AND GIVE
[ct=7483.885] JORDAN LOVE SOME TIME
[ct=7485.609] TO MAYBE GETS IN FIELD
[ct=7489.893] GOAL RANGE.
[ct=7492.569] >> Al: SO FOR THE
[ct=7492.569] MOMENT THEY ARE
[ct=7492.991] LEAVING THE OFFENSE
[ct=7494.593] OUT ON THE FIELD.
[ct=7496.152] AIN’T THIS
[ct=7498.868] FASCINATING?
[ct=7501.436] IF NOTHING ELSE DRAW
[ct=7502.980] THEM OFFSIDE, YEAH.
[ct=7503.521] >> Kirk: GOT THE
[ct=7507.903] >> Kirk: MAYBE THE
[ct=7510.853] THINKING YOU KNOW ME,
[ct=7510.853] I’M THE GUY THAT GOES
[ct=7514.481] FOR IT ON 4th DOWN AND
[ct=7514.481] THEN CALL YOUR
[ct=7518.104] >> Al: HE COULD.
[ct=7519.552] OR HE SAYS TO HECK
[ct=7521.776] WITH IT.
[ct=7521.997] ARE THEY GOING?
[ct=7522.345] THEY ARE GOING.
[ct=7523.226] AND McDUFFIE IS ABLE
[ct=7524.492] TO PICK UP THE FIRST
[ct=7526.010] SO GOFF FALLS DOWN AS
[ct=7526.923] HE’S MAKING THE
[ct=7527.746] HAND-OFF, AND THIS
[ct=7529.249] SHOULD SEAL IT.
[ct=7529.883] THEY’LL RUN THE CLOCK
[ct=7531.497] DOWN, KICK THE FIELD
[ct=7534.861] WHAT A CALL!
[ct=7537.953] AND THEN GOFF IS
[ct=7539.398] STUMBLING WHEN HE’S
[ct=7539.398] TRYING TO MAKE THE
[ct=7541.105] >> Kirk: I DON’T KNOW.
[ct=7542.112] HE MUST HAVE GOTTEN
[ct=7542.908] STEPPED OUT WHEN HE
[ct=7543.112] CAME OUT.
[ct=7546.168] WHAT A GOOD JOB OF
[ct=7546.168] KEEPING HIS FOCUS AND
[ct=7547.318] STAYING LONG ENOUGH ON
[ct=7549.695] LET’S WATCH HIS FEET.
[ct=7551.347] YEAH, HE GETS STEPPED
[ct=7554.392] ON BY GLASGOW, THE
[ct=7555.088] LEFT GUARD.
[ct=7556.875] AND SOMEHOW HE REACHES
[ct=7558.721] ONCE HE GOT IT TO
[ct=7559.525] MONTGOMERY, WHAT A
[ct=7560.803] CALL, BY THE WAY.
[ct=7562.698] ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
[ct=7564.792] 4 OF 5 NOW, COLLEGE
[ct=7565.567] BALL HE’S DOWN.
[ct=7567.377] THIS IS THE PRO GAME
[ct=7570.239] HE’S GOOD TO GO.
[ct=7572.906] 4 OF 5 FROM 4th DOWN.
[ct=7574.113] >> Al: AMAZING.
[ct=7575.107] >> Kirk: HEY, YOU GOT
[ct=7576.695] TO BE WHO YOU ARE,
[ct=7577.824] RIGHT?
[ct=7582.199] >> Al: THAT’S RIGHT.
[ct=7583.801] HE’S DAN CAMPBELL.
[ct=7584.902] MEANWHILE, NIXON IS
[ct=7585.402] SHAKEN UP.
[ct=7586.881] YOU’VE GOT TO LUN DAN
[ct=7588.615] DON’T FORGET HE’S THE
[ct=7589.661] GUY WHO CAME IN AND HE
[ct=7591.372] SAID WE’RE GOING TO
[ct=7592.227] BITE OFF YOUR
[ct=7593.456] KNEECAPS.
[ct=7595.463] AND EVERYBODY SAYS WHO
[ct=7597.582] IS THIS GOOF.
[ct=7599.465] ABOUT NOT GETTING IN
[ct=7600.208] THE KICKER CLOSER.
[ct=7602.476] YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WAS
[ct=7602.858] ABOUT?
[ct=7603.554] TAKING ALL THE TIME
[ct=7604.735] AWAY FROM JORDAN LOVE,
[ct=7605.675] THE POSSIBILITY OF HIM
[ct=7606.482] GETTING THE BALL AND
[ct=7608.198] MOVING INTO FIELD GOAL
[ct=7608.548] RANGE.
[ct=7609.162] HE THOUGHT IT WAS
[ct=7610.416] WORTH THE RISK TO GO
[ct=7611.987] FOR IT, BELIEVED IN
[ct=7613.550] HIS GUYS, GETS THE
[ct=7614.394] FIRST DOWN, AND NOW
[ct=7616.512] WORKS THAT CLOCK DOWN,
[ct=7621.677] KICK A LAST SECOND
[ct=7621.985] FIELD GOAL.
[ct=7622.247] AND LaFLEUR AND LOVE
[ct=7622.804] WON’T GET A CHANCE TO
[ct=7624.538] TOUCH THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=7625.035] >> Al: AND A MAJOR
[ct=7626.751] RISK.
[ct=7627.475] AND LOVE WOULD HAVE
[ct=7629.559] HAD TO DO IT WITHOUT A
[ct=7632.553] THAT WOULDN’T HAVE
[ct=7634.817] BEEN EASY EITHER.
[ct=7635.397] >> Kirk: JUST GET IT
[ct=7636.590] IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
[ct=7638.183] >> Al: WE’VE HAD A FEW
[ct=7639.489] CRAZY ENDINGS ON
[ct=7640.109] THURSDAY.
[ct=7641.750] MAKE UP FOR THE LAST
[ct=7644.278] TWO YEARS.
[ct=7649.684] ABOUT THAT.
[ct=7650.505] >> Al: JUST GETTING IT
[ct=7654.406] IN POSITION WHERE
[ct=7655.534] BATES WANTED IT TO GET
[ct=7658.244] A BETTER SHOT AT IT.
[ct=7659.130] SO IT COMES DOWN TO
[ct=7660.021] THIS.
[ct=7660.578] BATES IS NO STRANGER
[ct=7662.793] TO WINNING GAMES AT
[ct=7666.811] THE END.
[ct=7669.254] 52-YARD GAME WINNING
[ct=7669.556] FIELD GOAL AGAINST
[ct=7669.811] HOUSTON.
[ct=7671.479] HAD A CAREER LONG 58
[ct=7674.558] IN THAT GAME.
[ct=7675.852] KICKED A 64-YARDER FOR
[ct=7677.039] THE MICHIGAN PANTHERS
[ct=7678.171] OF THE UNITED LEAGUE.
[ct=7679.047] REMINDER TO STAY TUNED
[ct=7682.359] AFTER THE GAME, THE JC
[ct=7683.711] PENNEY POST GAME SHOW.
[ct=7684.872] KAYLEE WITH THE STAR
[ct=7687.775] A LOT TO CHEW ON FOR
[ct=7687.984] THAT GAME.
[ct=7690.328] KICK HE MADE IN THE
[ct=7693.000] UFL, THAT WAS A BOMB.
[ct=7695.113] IT’S A DIFFERENT -- A
[ct=7696.081] DIFFERENT RISK HERE OR
[ct=7696.944] DIFFERENT CHALLENGE, I
[ct=7699.961] SHOULD SAY HERE.
[ct=7703.373] >> Al: HAVE TO SNAP
[ct=7705.270] IT, JACK FOX TO HOLD
[ct=7708.844] 35 YARDS TO WIN IT.
[ct=7710.165] AND EXTEND THE WINNING
[ct=7714.255] STREAK TO 11.
[ct=7725.451] BALL GAME!
[ct=7728.320] AND WHAT A GAME!
[ct=7735.634] 34-31, LIONS.
[ct=7738.067] GO TO 12-1.
[ct=7738.554] STILL THE NUMBER ONE
[ct=7740.883] SEED IN THE NFC.
[ct=7743.884] PACKERS DROP TO 9-4.
[ct=7744.832] >> Kirk: SO THE TWO
[ct=7746.084] GAMES THIS YEAR THAT
[ct=7747.427] GOFF AND ALLIANCE
[ct=7751.002] PLAYED AGAINST GREEN
[ct=7755.314] 6 OF 7 ON 4th DOWN AND
[ct=7756.195] FOUR 4th DOWN
[ct=7759.278] TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=7759.535] JUST INCREDIBLE THE
[ct=7760.785] RISKS HE’S WILLING TO
[ct=7763.066] TAKE IN THESE
[ct=7764.088] DIVISIONAL MATCHUPS
[ct=7765.584] AND PAYS OFF FOR HIM.
[ct=7766.527] >> Al: THAT WAS AN
[ct=7768.750] A-PLUS OR AN F-MINUS
[ct=7769.541] DEPENDING HOW IT
[ct=7770.924] WORKED OUT.
[ct=7772.647] >> Kirk: RIGHT.
[ct=7773.503] GOFF MADE IT EXTRA
[ct=7774.360] SPECIAL BY GETTING
[ct=7775.911] STEPPED ON, GETTING
[ct=7777.605] OUT OF THERE AND STILL
[ct=7780.747] GOT THE FOOTBALL TO
[ct=7788.349] >> Al: 34-31.
[ct=7790.020] SO BATES, HE’S GETTING
[ct=7792.021] USED TO THIS.
[ct=7794.079] DOES IT AGAIN, YES,
[ct=7794.268] SIR.
[ct=7797.456] FROM 35 OUT.
[ct=7805.118] THAT MADE THE
[ct=7806.669] DIFFERENCE.
[ct=7811.572] GOFF 32 OF 41.
[ct=7816.862] 283 YARDS FOR LaFLEUR
[ct=7819.514] ANOTHER TOUGH LOSS.
[ct=7820.840] THEY DON’T COME MUCH
[ct=7822.178] TOUGHER THAN THAT.
[ct=7822.178] OF COURSE, DAN
[ct=7823.482] CAMPBELL DIFFERENT
[ct=7825.818] REACTION, OBVIOUSLY.N
[ct=7825.818] DETROI TT HEWINS I MTOT IORN A
