[ct=0.581] So the Chargers won the toss.
[ct=4.221] They have deferred.
[ct=5.565] Dustin Hopkins will kick off.
[ct=7.196] And Isiah Pacheco, a rookie seventh-round pick out
[ct=12.206] of Rutgers, who was their leading rusher last week,
[ct=17.527] So each team with a victory on opening day.
[ct=20.162] And off we go from Kansas City with a touchback.
[ct=30.789] Patrick Mahomes in the division.
[ct=32.995] How tough has he been in the AFC West?
[ct=34.773] There it is, 21 and 3, a 4 to 1 touchdown-to-interception ratio,
[ct=40.852] and a rating in triple figures.
[ct=45.019] Important for him tonight, settle in,
[ct=48.049] get the ball out of his hands quickly with this rush.
[ct=52.032] Last week or Sunday in Arizona, he
[ct=56.007] scored on his first three possessions, 3 touchdown passes.
[ct=59.991] They use a lot of motion.
[ct=61.296] Hardman is the motion man here.
[ct=62.648] Give it to Clyde Edwards-Helaire.
[ct=66.194] And he picks up about 5.
[ct=67.993] So last week on that first touchdown throw,
[ct=70.346] he sprained his left wrist.
[ct=72.189] It is taped tonight.
[ct=74.000] You can see it.
[ct=75.945] But how much did it bother him?
[ct=76.089] He only threw for more touchdown passes after that.
[ct=78.582] And he told us in our meeting yesterday, first day
[ct=82.601] after, it hurt a little bit.
[ct=83.896] By the second or third day, he felt good to go.
[ct=86.682] He said it wouldn't matter.
[ct=87.901] He was playing no matter what.
[ct=90.010] Edwards-Helaire again.
[ct=91.922] And with that second burst, he's able to pick up the first down.
[ct=95.860] So they give it to him twice.
[ct=97.766] He scored two touchdowns last week on pass receptions.
[ct=101.164] They may mark it a little bit short, and they do.
[ct=103.855] It looked like he was able to thrust across the 35-yard line,
[ct=107.867] but he did not.
[ct=109.124] So it will be third down and 1.
[ct=110.094] Andy Reid feels really good about Clyde Edwards-Helaire
[ct=114.447] and what he can bring in his third year.
[ct=115.033] He's had an entire offseason of being healthy.
[ct=117.766] He brings a physicality.
[ct=119.819] He's undersized.
[ct=120.018] He's thick and low center of gravity.
[ct=125.090] Joey Bosa, Khalil Mack, a formidable tandem
[ct=129.854] on the outside.
[ct=130.612] Give it to the up man.
[ct=131.939] And that's Michael Burton, the fullback.
[ct=133.698] So three straight runs for the Chiefs and a first down.
[ct=138.068] And remember, this Chargers defense
[ct=139.665] talked about trying to get more physical up front,
[ct=143.682] Khalil Mack, you think about him as a pass rusher.
[ct=145.839] But one of the best edge defenders against the run.
[ct=149.913] They were 30th in the league last year against the run.
[ct=152.981] So they made a lot of moves.
[ct=153.920] And the Chiefs testing that here early in those first three
[ct=156.957] plays.
[ct=159.601] [play call]
[ct=161.184] Mahomes, first pass of the night,
[ct=163.569] set up a little bit of a screen.
[ct=164.908] He cuts back inside, does Edwards-Helaire,
[ct=167.580] and is close to a first down.
[ct=170.239] Containment to the outside, cut back inside.
[ct=172.905] And we'll see where they mark it.
[ct=174.227] Good job here by the center, Creed Humphrey.
[ct=177.020] Watch him get out.
[ct=178.203] Very athletic center, really controls things up front.
[ct=180.841] He doesn't sell it too early.
[ct=182.216] Then, he does a nice job on the kickout block.
[ct=183.671] And you don't need to give Clyde Edwards-Helaire much room.
[ct=187.491] Really good acceleration, and here he is again.
[ct=189.847] Looking it up, good kickout block right there
[ct=192.809] on Kenneth Murray.
[ct=193.165] He gives him plenty of room to pick up that first down.
[ct=195.485] Humphrey, second-round draft choice last year
[ct=197.538] out of Oklahoma, helped to cement that offensive front.
[ct=202.062] That was a big priority for Kansas City
[ct=204.792] Off the fake, rolling left, he dumps it underneath.
[ct=207.414] He settles for a pass to Burton, who did step out of bounds.
[ct=211.388] He tried to cut back inside, steps out
[ct=214.025] after a very short gain.
[ct=215.391] Gain of 2, it'll be second down and 8.
[ct=217.876] You and I talked about last week, Eric Bieniemy
[ct=222.010] and Andy Reid and this offense, they
[ct=223.360] faced a lot of blitzing, a lot of man-to-man.
[ct=225.549] And they were licking their chops, had a big day today.
[ct=228.720] They know they're going to have to be more patient.
[ct=231.310] Much like last year, people sat back,
[ct=232.655] kept their safeties deep forced.
[ct=233.523] This offense and Patrick Mahomes have to be more patient.
[ct=236.772] I think that will be the story tonight.
[ct=239.311] Kelce flares out, leaps up, makes the catch.
[ct=243.305] His first catch of the night.
[ct=244.624] He had a great game last week.
[ct=245.467] Of course, he's been fantastic for the last seven seasons.
[ct=248.704] He's going to the Pro Bowl.
[ct=249.894] Derwin James makes the tackle there.
[ct=252.619] It'll be third down and short.
[ct=252.637] And that's the matchup we want to see, right?
[ct=255.246] I mean, Derwin James, one of the top most versatile players
[ct=257.885] in the NFL.
[ct=259.231] He's going to be matched up one-on-one quite a bit.
[ct=260.558] He gets over a little bit late which allows
[ct=263.199] Kelce to get to the outside.
[ct=264.494] That will be a matchup, a game within the game
[ct=267.196] is Mahomes trying to dial up Kelce against James.
[ct=271.205] He plays all over the field--
[ct=272.621] in the box, outside, deep.
[ct=276.469] Give the ball here to Hardman.
[ct=277.813] And Hardman is stuffed in the backfield at the 46-yard line.
[ct=281.782] That's Joey Bosa trailing him on the outside
[ct=285.149] and knocking him down there.
[ct=287.113] It'll be fourth down and in comes the punting unit.
[ct=288.406] Yeah, a tough ask for Kelce, as good as he is,
[ct=292.395] to try to hold the point here.
[ct=293.014] All you're going to see getting the ball to the outside,
[ct=296.376] he's got to hold that edge.
[ct=297.718] Hold that edge.
[ct=297.749] You cannot allow the speed of Hardman to get outside.
[ct=301.718] Boy, he is so strong.
[ct=303.069] Again, another guy, you think about his ability
[ct=305.084] to rush the quarterback.
[ct=307.060] They have two edge players in Mack and Bosa
[ct=308.425] that take just as much pride in defending the run.
[ct=312.318] Tommy Townsend in to punt.
[ct=313.690] DeAndre Carter, who's been in nine camps and has played
[ct=317.648] in games with five different teams over the years,
[ct=321.166] and had a touchdown reception last week,
[ct=328.282] saved.
[ct=329.613] It cannot.
[ct=330.949] It's a touchback.
[ct=332.306] And so the Chargers will get the ball at the 20.
[ct=336.229] And here comes Justin Herbert.
[ct=338.863] [music playing]
[ct=341.923] Going through his progressions, and it's a 9-yard pickup to Mike
[ct=345.167] Williams, who was seldomly used last week.
[ct=348.320] Only 2 balls, but they go right to him
[ct=350.830] tonight in the absence of Keenan Allen.
[ct=353.007] Yeah.
[ct=353.514] And as you just said, watch him work the progressions.
[ct=356.198] Anytime he throws, he'll start right.
[ct=357.669] Look at the feet.
[ct=358.791] He gets in perfect position.
[ct=360.156] How about the location of the ball?
[ct=362.789] Low and away.
[ct=364.124] Eyes come back to that third target,
[ct=365.606] away from L'Jarius Sneed.
[ct=366.912] Perfect throw there on first and 10.
[ct=369.450] Second and 1, off the play action.
[ct=372.101] Good protection, he fires, caught up at the 44-yard line.
[ct=376.803] And that is caught by Williams.
[ct=378.718] He's already made as many catches
[ct=380.097] in the first couple of minutes of this game
[ct=381.413] as he did all of last Sunday.
[ct=382.723] Here's Herbert now and some of his numbers.
[ct=385.519] Third year in the league.
[ct=388.042] He's been in here twice.
[ct=388.320] And what's happened, he's won both times.
[ct=390.683] 7 touchdowns through the air and 1 on the ground, no picks.
[ct=394.679] To the left, he goes.
[ct=396.009] He throws it away.
[ct=397.336] He was under pressure that time from Leo Chenal,
[ct=398.820] a rookie out of Wisconsin.
[ct=401.299] Second and 10.
[ct=402.648] Yeah, just confused on the right side of that offensive line.
[ct=405.022] And really, that's going to be the question tonight for Herbert
[ct=410.621] and the Chargers.
[ct=411.952] You've got a rookie in Zion Johnson out of Boston College
[ct=415.938] and Pipkins, who took over for the first time.
[ct=420.167] Ekeler, and Austin takes it to the 48-yard line.
[ct=425.224] Austin Ekeler, I mean, a guy who's
[ct=426.671] very much under the radar around the National Football League.
[ct=431.896] But last year, 20 touchdowns, which
[ct=434.359] tied with Jonathan Taylor of Indianapolis for the league
[ct=438.513] lead.
[ct=439.853] Another guy that's got a low center of gravity.
[ct=442.491] He catches the ball, pass protection.
[ct=444.093] He's just a complete back.
[ct=445.263] And again, with Keenan Allen down, you're
[ct=447.824] going to see his workload step up especially
[ct=450.065] in the passing game.
[ct=451.818] That was a gain of 8.
[ct=453.853] Third and 2.
[ct=458.433] Hangs in the pocket, fires, that's caught.
[ct=459.960] And that takes it to the 35 and a first down for DeAndre Carter.
[ct=465.161] Great story.
[ct=465.925] This guy's been around, in and out of camps,
[ct=467.885] five different teams, as I said before, and played a big part
[ct=471.695] in the game last week.
[ct=473.086] Here, they just do a nice job of attacking the zone.
[ct=475.653] You have a young rookie corner in Watson, 35.
[ct=478.528] One guy goes over the top, another underneath.
[ct=482.340] Watson sits.
[ct=483.670] No problem, third and short.
[ct=485.003] The easy throw underneath, pick up the first down.
[ct=487.628] New running back here is Joshua Kelley.
[ct=490.330] They've got Ekeler.
[ct=491.615] They've got Kelley and Sony Michel now with the Chargers
[ct=494.303] as well.
[ct=496.936] Give it to Kelley.
[ct=497.857] He slips through that hole over the right guard.
[ct=502.245] Inside the 30, tackled by Carlos Dunlap.
[ct=505.016] Several years on Andy Reid's staff.
[ct=507.511] Herbert to the outside.
[ct=508.704] And that pass in front of Joshua Taylor and incomplete.
[ct=512.674] A little off target right there.
[ct=513.340] It's third down and 3.
[ct=515.299] For the Chargers, doing a pretty good job
[ct=517.406] of giving Herbert time to throw.
[ct=520.798] That will be one of the few throws
[ct=520.948] that you see from him that will be off target.
[ct=524.800] He had an open man out there, but really
[ct=526.070] looks to be settled in and throwing
[ct=527.834] in rhythm until that throw.
[ct=529.837] Third and short.
[ct=531.557] You ever wonder about Herbert, that
[ct=532.894] drive he led in the fourth quarter
[ct=534.249] and in overtime against Vegas last year
[ct=536.892] at the end of the season, off the charts.
[ct=541.767] Third and 3.
[ct=546.216] Four-man rush, he has time.
[ct=549.620] And then falling down and getting the flag,
[ct=552.235] so that'll be interference.
[ct=553.591] That is Joshua Palmer.
[ct=556.197] The contact from Rashad Fenton.
[ct=558.859] And we'll hear from John Hussey officially.
[ct=562.829] It should result and a first down.
[ct=568.158] Pass interference, defense, number 27.
[ct=570.814] Ball will be placed at the spot of the foul, automatic first
[ct=574.802] down.
[ct=576.145] Well, I mean, you talk about working through progressions
[ct=578.792] He ended up going back all the way to his fourth target.
[ct=581.491] He ends up trying to get the ball to Palmer.
[ct=584.127] There's that tight coverage.
[ct=585.448] And again, he grabs on to that jersey-- an easy call.
[ct=588.086] But the rookie right guard, Zion Johnson,
[ct=589.164] he's going up against Chris Jones, one of the top interior
[ct=593.194] pass rushers in the entire league.
[ct=595.850] He holds his own there.
[ct=597.161] Rookie first-round pick is Johnson out of Boston College.
[ct=603.814] He floats one to the end zone.
[ct=605.140] Williams off the back shoulder and incomplete.
[ct=607.796] He looks around for a flag.
[ct=610.474] L'Jarius Sneed blitzed on that.
[ct=613.253] They had the rookie on him as well.
[ct=614.694] Jaylen Watson out of Washington State
[ct=615.935] picked in the seventh round.
[ct=617.248] Yeah, minus Trent McDuffie who was picked in the first round.
[ct=621.241] He's hurt, inactive tonight.
[ct=622.603] Off the play, sets up the screen.
[ct=625.214] Caught, but right there, Austin Ekeler gets buried by Willie Gay
[ct=631.840] as he makes the catch.
[ct=633.179] It'll be third down and long.
[ct=634.685] Boy, did Willie Gay feel this the entire time.
[ct=637.193] Chris Jones does a good job of getting the pressure.
[ct=639.790] But Gay is just sitting back there waiting, just waiting
[ct=643.797] to see if this is a screen.
[ct=645.126] He's almost getting out there before Ekeler even
[ct=647.779] has a chance to catch the ball.
[ct=649.147] Once he does, he's there to make the tackle.
[ct=651.838] Nice play.
[ct=653.186] Crowd back at full throat now on a third and 13.
[ct=657.149] [crowd roaring]
[ct=663.891] Silent count, play clock winding down.
[ct=667.867] Herbert surveys, shoots it underneath.
[ct=670.549] Nice move there by Gerald Everett, the former Ram.
[ct=674.536] He played last year with the Seahawks.
[ct=675.840] He doesn't get the first down, but sets
[ct=677.172] up what should be an easier field goal
[ct=679.824] attempt unless, of course, you got Brandon Staley, who loves
[ct=683.839] to go for it on fourth down.
[ct=685.129] But here, he won't.
[ct=686.482] He has that reputation.
[ct=687.784] Last year, 34 attempts on fourth down,
[ct=690.520] which was as many as you'd see in this league.
[ct=693.103] But I think he's got a better team this year,
[ct=695.742] which doesn't make him maybe feel that he
[ct=698.464] needs to go for it as often.
[ct=699.782] Dustin Hopkins, the Chargers have
[ct=701.086] had terrible kicking problems for a decade.
[ct=705.060] He may have solved them last year.
[ct=706.420] He came over from Washington, did a good job,
[ct=709.058] wins the job this year.
[ct=711.710] 31-yard attempt, and the Los Angeles Chargers are
[ct=717.037] on the board.
[ct=718.371] A couple of ticks under 6 minutes to go in the quarter.
[ct=720.995] Apparently not retired Tyreek Hill's number.
[ct=724.989] Here, you got Pacheco wearing number 10.
[ct=728.982] There he is.
[ct=730.257] Sorry, folks, he's not there with the Dawson and Lanier
[ct=732.955] and Bobby Bell and all the rest.
[ct=738.242] And he lets that one sail through the end zone.
[ct=742.244] We were talking to him yesterday.
[ct=744.928] And he talked about bringing all of the guys
[ct=747.573] down to his home near Fort Worth.
[ct=750.198] And they were there for about two weeks.
[ct=752.913] And you're not talking about four or five guys.
[ct=754.232] You're talking about 18 to 20 guys.
[ct=756.893] And I think it talks about the leadership of Patrick Mahomes,
[ct=759.543] now in his fifth year as a starting quarterback.
[ct=760.848] And he said going to dinner and just hanging out and developing
[ct=764.925] chemistry, getting to know each other probably
[ct=766.214] had as much to do with that as working on the actual offense
[ct=770.218] in the scheme.
[ct=772.905] Well, he's the real deal.
[ct=774.212] This just in.
[ct=776.903] Clyde Edwards-Helaire for a gain of 3.
[ct=782.185] Let's go to Kaylee.
[ct=783.497] So Al, when all the running backs and receivers
[ct=784.864] and tight ends took Mahomes up on that invite to Texas
[ct=788.060] and put this team first, Travis Kelce
[ct=790.710] told me it really set the tempo for this year.
[ct=793.401] The selflessness he saw, he told me,
[ct=794.689] gave him the reassurance that all these guys
[ct=797.240] are on the same page.
[ct=799.880] When Kelce shows up, you know that everybody's
[ct=801.206] bought in, right?
[ct=802.565] 87 is there.
[ct=803.879] You better be there.
[ct=806.613] They go five wide here on second down and 7.
[ct=811.902] Chargers blitz, and they get him right up the middle.
[ct=815.885] Drue Tranquill, number 49.
[ct=818.594] And Khalil Mack is there as well.
[ct=821.213] Tranquill had an interception last week.
[ct=823.862] And of course, Mack had three sacks in the opener.
[ct=826.538] Yeah, a little miscommunication up front on that right side
[ct=829.180] of the offensive line.
[ct=831.837] Tranquill is right up at the line of scrimmage.
[ct=833.188] You can see Trey Smith, the right guard,
[ct=835.817] actually steps down to his left, creating that opening.
[ct=839.788] And he just shoots that gap between Smith and the right
[ct=841.273] tackle, Wylie, for an easy interception.
[ct=845.122] Nothing Mahomes could do there--
[ct=846.598] or a sack there.
[ct=849.142] Mahomes last season was blitzed only 15% of the time.
[ct=853.099] That's about 1 every 7 drop backs.
[ct=855.723] Third and 16.
[ct=857.708] And they blow that play up in the backfield.
[ct=861.716] Derwin James is right there to take care of McKinnon
[ct=865.029] as he makes the grab.
[ct=866.351] And it's fourth down on a very fast three-and-out.
[ct=869.050] Yeah, it is really hard on this offensive line
[ct=871.814] when you have Derwin James right here.
[ct=873.852] He's just sitting and waiting and eyeing
[ct=875.741] McKinnon, who's known as a back who typically they
[ct=879.624] throw the ball to.
[ct=880.984] So he's locked in on him.
[ct=881.112] You can see the rest of that defense
[ct=882.463] is they're not fooled at all on third down
[ct=885.773] that they go to the screen.
[ct=887.625] Not often do the Chiefs punt twice
[ct=890.242] in the first 11 minutes of the game,
[ct=892.949] but Tommy Townsend sends it skyward
[ct=895.576] here for the second time.
[ct=896.937] This is Carter.
[ct=898.026] Mile-high kick, and Carter wiggles his way out
[ct=903.529] to the 42-yard line.
[ct=906.079] To be the elite quarterback in this league.
[ct=911.750] From the 42-yard line, backfield was empty.
[ct=916.847] Pass is caught, 8-yard gain.
[ct=918.447] So Mike Williams already a big part of the action tonight.
[ct=921.575] Again, if you tuned in late, Keenan Allen, their number 1
[ct=926.127] receiver, hamstring strain last week.
[ct=930.143] He can't play tonight.
[ct=931.441] Maybe with a long week now, 10 days before the next game,
[ct=935.438] he can play.
[ct=936.721] But what I like to see from Joe Lombardi
[ct=938.064] as a play caller is he's moving Mike Williams around.
[ct=940.864] He's filling that void.
[ct=941.693] And they're attacking the interior of the zone
[ct=944.695] here from Kansas City just sitting down in that soft spot.
[ct=951.362] Second and 2 to the outside.
[ct=952.877] And it's going to be a throw back here to Ekeler.
[ct=955.341] But that's going to be blown up in the backfield.
[ct=958.188] So DeAndre Carter, a little razzle-dazzle.
[ct=961.969] But they should erase that one from the playbook.
[ct=965.956] It's a loss of 4.
[ct=967.342] Yeah, we just talked about Joe Lombardi and what a great job
[ct=969.944] And then they throw a ball that looks like it's
[ct=972.625] just too slow and developing.
[ct=974.008] Very fortunate that Ekeler came back to the ball.
[ct=977.269] Kansas City showing great discipline there
[ct=979.294] on that second down play.
[ct=980.756] Dangerous.
[ct=982.014] Very.
[ct=983.286] Third and 6.
[ct=987.249] 2 and 1/2 left in the opening quarter.
[ct=995.153] Herbert fires, and that's going to be
[ct=996.504] caught close to a first down.
[ct=999.181] Williams spinning around.
[ct=1000.521] Did he get it?
[ct=1001.363] You see where they mark it.
[ct=1003.134] Looking at the yellow line, which, by the way,
[ct=1005.491] is unofficial in case you're wondering.
[ct=1008.477] You have to mention that at least once a year, right?
[ct=1013.792] And I love that he went to the matchup.
[ct=1015.106] He went to the rookie with his best receiver tonight.
[ct=1017.872] Williams comes up just a little bit short.
[ct=1023.062] But you understand why he wanted to try to get that matchup.
[ct=1025.744] And even though it was tight coverage, he's rolled up on him,
[ct=1029.112] he still makes that throw.
[ct=1031.044] They're actually going to bring out the sticks here.
[ct=1042.857] Looks to be a little short.
[ct=1045.524] Pretty good effort there after the catch for the--
[ct=1048.185] --fight for that first down.
[ct=1052.196] A game of inches.
[ct=1056.173] Yeah, all right, so now you got the first decision.
[ct=1060.162] Brandon Staley last year going for it.
[ct=1064.157] Look, there's a fine line between aggressiveness
[ct=1066.785] and recklessness.
[ct=1068.133] Sometimes it worked last year.
[ct=1070.753] Other times, it did not.
[ct=1073.397] I think they're confident with how
[ct=1074.749] their defense has played here in these first couple of drives.
[ct=1077.382] And right around midfield, they bring in their heavy unit.
[ct=1082.728] Next Gen Stats right there powered by AWS.
[ct=1088.054] Put a fullback in, Xander Horvath.
[ct=1093.310] The Chiefs expecting a quick huddle here.
[ct=1095.969] They're already down and ready in the interior.
[ct=1101.303] At the 48, Sony Michel is the running back.
[ct=1107.927] He's the I-back here.
[ct=1109.276] And Herbert's going to keep it himself and pick up
[ct=1113.312] So Brandon Staley begins the year 1 for 1.
[ct=1117.344] So much for the drama there.
[ct=1118.659] That was pretty quick.
[ct=1119.954] He just got under center and took it.
[ct=1121.298] It's pretty nice having a 6' 6" quarterback and a center
[ct=1125.189] that's as good as there is.
[ct=1126.548] And the big man just goes right over top of his center--
[ct=1130.501] easy first down.
[ct=1133.143] Herbert on third and 1 or fourth and 1 in his career, 13 out
[ct=1138.485] Picking up the first down in those situations.
[ct=1142.470] Michel stays in the game.
[ct=1145.126] Former Patriot, won a Super Bowl ring with the Rams last year.
[ct=1150.444] And Sony Michel cuts it back, turns it into a nice run.
[ct=1154.414] He picks up about 7 to the 40, where
[ct=1157.059] Willie Gay makes the tackle.
[ct=1158.333] Great vision here by Michel.
[ct=1159.702] And a heck of a job by the backside of this offensive
[ct=1163.701] line getting a push.
[ct=1165.050] Watch how important those backside blocks are.
[ct=1166.338] That play is designed to go to the left.
[ct=1169.042] The combination of the vision by Michel,
[ct=1170.325] the right side of that offensive line getting a good push down,
[ct=1174.320] open that up for positive yards.
[ct=1179.625] Final minute of the quarter on a second down and 3.
[ct=1184.951] Good protection.
[ct=1186.266] Going deep downfield, and a battle
[ct=1188.935] is won there with a flag thrown by Mike Williams with Fenton
[ct=1194.223] covering on the play.
[ct=1195.571] Flag comes in.
[ct=1196.920] If it's against Kansas City, it's at the 1-yard line.
[ct=1200.891] The ball is underthrown.
[ct=1202.192] He's trying to work his way back.
[ct=1203.545] And it's going to definitely be on Kansas City here.
[ct=1207.545] But a heck of an effort.
[ct=1208.841] You talk about a guy that's off to a good start
[ct=1210.153] tonight for Brandon Staley--
[ct=1212.876] Who was going to step up for Keenan Allen?
[ct=1215.491] It's Mike Williams so far.
[ct=1216.835] Boy, that's a heck of a job of coming back and making
[ct=1219.491] 6' 4" working against a guy who's 5' 11".
[ct=1228.755] There are two fouls on the play, both by the same team.
[ct=1232.620] Holding, defense, number 27.
[ct=1236.635] Pass interference, defense, number 27, also declined.
[ct=1243.317] The result of the play is a first down.
[ct=1244.589] That's your daily double right there for Fenton.
[ct=1247.281] Fenton, that's a tough matchup.
[ct=1248.583] You mentioned the size.
[ct=1249.919] Play action, he's got all kinds of time.
[ct=1252.593] And he's just grabbing on to the jersey.
[ct=1255.216] You see he makes that cut to the outside.
[ct=1256.549] You can see he's very handsy the entire route.
[ct=1258.991] And then when he comes back, head's
[ct=1261.668] not turned back to the football.
[ct=1262.960] An easy call for the officials, but they
[ct=1265.646] don't need it with the catch.
[ct=1266.962] First and goal.
[ct=1273.576] Keep it on the ground.
[ct=1274.936] And stopped just short, Sony Michel.
[ct=1277.627] That's L'Jarius Sneed coming up from the corner
[ct=1280.271] to make sure he doesn't get in.
[ct=1281.551] And that might take us to the end of the first quarter.
[ct=1285.534] Clock ticking down.
[ct=1286.870] They'll change sides in a moment.
[ct=1288.261] And 38, nice job of just filling in.
[ct=1290.876] He's one of the top slot corners in this league.
[ct=1294.879] And really good job as a run defender as he
[ct=1296.190] shows you right there.
[ct=1297.491] Chargers have a second down and goal at the 1 and a 3-0 lead.
[ct=1306.943] Michel stays in.
[ct=1308.306] Tight formation, put the fullback in there now, Horvath.
[ct=1316.274] A little motion, off the fake, pass to the outside.
[ct=1320.262] Caught!
[ct=1321.550] And that's Horvath, a rookie out of Purdue,
[ct=1324.239] And he's begun his NFL career with two touchdowns
[ct=1328.255] in his first two games.
[ct=1329.524] What a start for the Chargers.
[ct=1330.880] They go with a heavy lineup here.
[ct=1332.233] They bring in a tackle to set up as a tight end over here,
[ct=1336.209] But then, they're going to go play action off of that,
[ct=1337.497] give you the look that they're going to try to pound you,
[ct=1340.203] and then slip the fullback out into the flat.
[ct=1342.827] Horvath catches Kansas City off guard.
[ct=1345.466] Great job again by Lombardi breaking a tendency there
[ct=1348.191] with that formation.
[ct=1349.460] And then the tight end is wide open out
[ct=1350.811] in the flat for the touchdown.
[ct=1358.759] Dustin Hopkins for the extra point.
[ct=1361.421] JK Scott holding and the Chargers
[ct=1365.387] with a very impressive drive.
[ct=1369.415] Third straight in this ballpark.
[ct=1370.733] That's right.
[ct=1372.082] But you just know Mahomes is going to answer, right?
[ct=1377.352] I have a feeling.
[ct=1381.350] So Pacheco is back there.
[ct=1382.684] He's watched the first two sail over his head
[ct=1386.695] and make it the hat trick here.
[ct=1388.018] So the Chargers with a lot of new guys defensively,
[ct=1390.657] that was where they placed the premium in the offseason.
[ct=1395.930] Joseph-Day from the Rams.
[ct=1397.293] Van Noy has been around, two-time Super Bowl champ.
[ct=1398.617] And we talked about JC Jackson from the Patriots.
[ct=1402.626] And Bryce Callahan, slot corner, had a pick last week.
[ct=1406.622] So new guys on that side of the ball.
[ct=1407.884] Tom Telesco and the gang in Los Angeles
[ct=1411.884] said, we've got to shore up that defense.
[ct=1414.565] And defensive, Tom Telesco and also
[ct=1417.213] what we've seen from Brandon Staley,
[ct=1418.535] they changed dramatically from where
[ct=1419.840] they were with Gus Bradley as a defensive coordinator
[ct=1423.830] to who they are now.
[ct=1426.495] Mahomes off the fake.
[ct=1429.148] And that's caught by Hardman, Mecole Hardman.
[ct=1431.714] That time, he had James blitzing, the safety.
[ct=1437.038] But they were able to fend him off
[ct=1438.334] to give Mahomes just enough time.
[ct=1441.023] Again, we talked about he could be anywhere.
[ct=1443.643] It's like a "Where's Waldo?"
[ct=1445.021] He's in the back.
[ct=1446.309] He's blitzing.
[ct=1447.648] He doesn't hide it.
[ct=1448.991] But Pacheco does a nice job.
[ct=1450.247] See Mahomes just enough to be able to step up early,
[ct=1454.268] You're able to get receivers downfield by keeping Pacheco in
[ct=1458.278] Yeah, that's a nice play by a seventh-round rookie
[ct=1460.946] to take care of James.
[ct=1463.589] Mahomes, 5 of 5 for 43.
[ct=1466.222] And that pass is incomplete.
[ct=1467.643] It's Asante Samuel covering Marquez Valdes-Scantling,
[ct=1473.127] So much attention on Khalil Mack and he and Bosa being
[ct=1477.037] teamed up, Derwin James who's one of the best
[ct=1479.674] But I'll tell you, JC Jackson, the corner who they picked up,
[ct=1483.656] you put him on the other side of Asante Samuel,
[ct=1486.309] this is a complete defense.
[ct=1487.618] Talking to Richard Sherman, who's on the pregame show,
[ct=1490.406] he's made it very clear.
[ct=1491.652] He thinks JC Jackson is the top corner in the entire NFL.
[ct=1496.978] And yet the Patriots found him expendable.
[ct=1500.943] Chargers say, thank you very much.
[ct=1502.267] Through the middle, bulling his way, gain of about 6.
[ct=1506.221] Goes Pacheco, 5' 10", 216, out of Rutgers,
[ct=1510.185] 62 yards on the ground last week.
[ct=1512.908] I'm dumbfounded on how he slid all the way
[ct=1516.883] When you look at his combine, he ran a 4.37,
[ct=1519.672] one of the fastest backs in Indianapolis.
[ct=1522.254] He's physical.
[ct=1523.504] Eric Bieniemy, I was talking to him last night.
[ct=1524.988] He kind of giggled about how fortunate
[ct=1527.651] And he had one of the best camps of any of the Chiefs
[ct=1531.614] as a rookie.
[ct=1532.972] Now, McKinnon is the running back.
[ct=1535.598] Smith-Schuster was the man in motion, sets up on the left.
[ct=1540.915] And Mahomes is going to go for 6.
[ct=1542.252] And there's nobody there except a Charger.
[ct=1544.909] However, a flag does come in.
[ct=1546.217] And that's Adderley for the moment.
[ct=1548.881] But the flag was thrown.
[ct=1550.366] You saw it come in.
[ct=1551.562] And the Chiefs are fairly confident it's
[ct=1554.182] against the Chargers.
[ct=1556.886] I think it was Bryce Callahan.
[ct=1560.868] John Hussey is going to check it out with the brethren.
[ct=1565.529] Marquez Valdes-Scantling on a route
[ct=1568.840] just trying to work back to the outside.
[ct=1570.393] He got locked up with him.
[ct=1571.475] Prior to the pass, illegal contact, defense, number 23.
[ct=1577.723] That 5-yard penalty will be enforced from the previous spot.
[ct=1581.530] Automatic first down.
[ct=1583.439] Kansas City has thrown a lot of underneath throws,
[ct=1585.436] but this time, they're trying to go downfield.
[ct=1587.553] And you can see that this--
[ct=1588.973] he gets tied up.
[ct=1590.049] I mean, they both did.
[ct=1591.406] The arm of Valdes-Scantling gets around Bryce Callahan.
[ct=1595.381] I think that's why he was frustrated.
[ct=1599.385] You see the pressure gets there.
[ct=1600.643] The big fella Austin Johnson gets home,
[ct=1601.992] forces Mahomes to get rid of that ball probably a tick
[ct=1605.978] earlier than he'd like to.
[ct=1607.334] Another one of the new guys, free agent.
[ct=1611.331] He had been with the Giants.
[ct=1612.626] First down now at the 34-yard line.
[ct=1616.624] McKinnon, Jerick McKinnon, decent run.
[ct=1621.231] He gets tripped up by James.
[ct=1623.471] He picks up about 6, second down.
[ct=1627.289] Let's call it second down then maybe 5, second and 5.
[ct=1632.551] Early in this game, a conservative
[ct=1634.045] approach by Andy Reid.
[ct=1636.549] Now you're starting to see them try to get
[ct=1638.127] the ball a couple of times.
[ct=1639.199] We've seen them getting the ball thrown downfield.
[ct=1642.141] Combination of running in the interior
[ct=1644.492] and challenging that Chargers, the moves
[ct=1646.044] they've made along with that passing game downfield.
[ct=1656.439] Quick pass to the outside and taken down immediately.
[ct=1660.355] Noah Gray, one of the tight ends.
[ct=1661.666] And James is just all over the field.
[ct=1664.308] He makes the stop there.
[ct=1664.578] Andy was telling us the other day, he loves tight ends.
[ct=1667.091] Without injuries, he might have dressed for tight ends tonight.
[ct=1672.278] And again, I think that's, how do you fill
[ct=1674.940] that void with Tyreek Hill?
[ct=1676.278] It's tight ends and also the receivers.
[ct=1677.629] Watch the motion and then watch Tyreek--
[ct=1680.242] or watch Derwin James just sneaking around.
[ct=1682.897] Not fooled at all, sat there patiently.
[ct=1685.041] He knew exactly what might be coming and makes a good play.
[ct=1690.864] Third and 4.
[ct=1696.528] Free play coming.
[ct=1698.851] Bosa was offside.
[ct=1700.180] And that is caught.
[ct=1701.187] And taking it inside the 10-yard line is Travis Kelce.
[ct=1704.895] Mahomes with a free play.
[ct=1706.802] Good luck to the defense.
[ct=1708.861] Offside, defense, number 97.
[ct=1712.170] That penalty is declined.
[ct=1714.783] 19-yard gain.
[ct=1714.928] Replay first down.
[ct=1717.698] He's the best in the NFL at drawing defenders offsides
[ct=1722.770] and then getting that free play.
[ct=1724.102] What I am confused by is the Chargers losing
[ct=1728.107] Kelce on a third down play.
[ct=1730.752] He does a good job of sitting down there.
[ct=1734.706] He get that free play.
[ct=1734.934] One of the best, those are like Aaron Rodgers' numbers
[ct=1737.671] on free plays.
[ct=1741.382] Mahomes flushed out.
[ct=1745.388] They can't get him.
[ct=1746.736] He sidearms it for a touchdown.
[ct=1750.705] So you think you have him, then you don't.
[ct=1753.257] He avoids the tackle and then just throws a sidearm fastball
[ct=1759.863] for the touchdown.
[ct=1762.578] Jerick McKinnon from the 9-yard line.
[ct=1765.234] It's just you run out of adjectives the way
[ct=1767.858] he's able to keep this play alive.
[ct=1769.210] Tremendous athletic ability, but it's the vision, the eyes
[ct=1771.832] downfield, and the sidearm to be able to make this play happen.
[ct=1778.508] He does it so often.
[ct=1781.047] But a good job of these receivers
[ct=1782.325] know when he does that, find the opening in the zone.
[ct=1786.344] And the offensive linemen, nobody goes downfield.
[ct=1789.024] Now, the kicker is Matt Ammendola
[ct=1790.293] because Harrison Butker is hurt.
[ct=1792.999] So they signed him a couple of days ago.
[ct=1796.317] He boots the extra point.
[ct=1797.645] And early in the second quarter, it's a 3-point game at Arrowhead
[ct=1808.294] Play clock, you don't see that.
[ct=1809.587] Delay of game.
[ct=1810.922] It went to 0.
[ct=1812.265] So--
[ct=1813.627] You've been calling games for a few years.
[ct=1816.179] Dave Toub, who's one of the best special teams coaches ever,
[ct=1820.151] it's a new kicker.
[ct=1821.417] For some reason, I don't know.
[ct=1822.773] I didn't see the breeze blow the ball off the tee or whatever.
[ct=1825.419] But anyway, Ammendola, who is with the Jets last year,
[ct=1828.093] got released.
[ct=1829.358] He was in the Houston camp for a few games or a couple of days
[ct=1833.343] anyway.
[ct=1834.692] And now he's signed in the absence of Butler, who they
[ct=1836.049] hope to have back by week 3.
[ct=1839.961] Kick fielded at the 4 by DeAndre Carter.
[ct=1844.039] And Carter wiggles his way with the ball out.
[ct=1847.937] The ball is out, and the Chiefs are there at the--
[ct=1851.929] they're going to say he was down.
[ct=1854.622] The crowd, of course, is in an uproar right now.
[ct=1858.604] Ammendola comes up with the ball.
[ct=1859.889] Hussey checking, but the signal was that he was down by contact.
[ct=1866.236] He better hope so.
[ct=1868.915] The ruling on the field is the runner was down by contact.
[ct=1875.535] First down, Los Angeles.
[ct=1880.863] All right, a closer look.
[ct=1882.163] Yeah, that's why they brought DeAndre Carter in.
[ct=1884.853] Let's see if that left knee is down.
[ct=1887.474] Boy, it looks like, yeah, he's down clearly
[ct=1890.144] before that ball comes out.
[ct=1891.504] Good call by the official.
[ct=1894.116] Chargers take over at the 33.
[ct=1896.831] Here's the knee down.
[ct=1898.120] And Carter, he's a specialist.
[ct=1899.457] But with the injury to Allen, he stepped up
[ct=1902.096] in a big way last week.
[ct=1903.455] And he'll have to make some plays tonight.
[ct=1906.089] He had a TD reception.
[ct=1908.723] Herbert off the fake.
[ct=1910.075] He keeps his eyes downfield.
[ct=1911.418] That pass is incomplete, intended for Joshua Palmer.
[ct=1915.384] It'll be second down and 10.
[ct=1920.394] Keenan Allen, we told you, is out tonight--
[ct=1924.363] hamstring.
[ct=1925.714] So most completions to a receiver in the quarterback's
[ct=1928.233] first two seasons in NFL history,
[ct=1930.900] Manning to Marvin Harrison, 174.
[ct=1933.315] They're second-- Herbert to Allen on top.
[ct=1937.308] You're losing your go-to guy on the road.
[ct=1940.028] And he's off to a heck of a start
[ct=1941.291] mainly by Mike Williams stepping in.
[ct=1943.927] Second and 10 to the outside again.
[ct=1946.640] Pass is high, but leaping and making the grip, Mike Williams.
[ct=1951.904] We mentioned he's only caught two last week.
[ct=1954.592] He wasn't a big part of the game plan.
[ct=1955.889] Tonight, already, Williams has 6 catches.
[ct=1958.577] And look what Spagnuolo is doing here is he's rolling up on him.
[ct=1962.573] He's up tight.
[ct=1965.226] And Ekeler bangs his way for a first down up to the 45.
[ct=1969.200] And they're doing everything they can to stop Mike Williams.
[ct=1973.198] Almost every catch that he's made,
[ct=1974.521] he's dealing with a corner up pressing him up in his face.
[ct=1977.153] But they're still going after that matchup against a rookie
[ct=1981.148] Jaylen Watson.
[ct=1983.782] Chargers doing a good job of varying the pace.
[ct=1987.794] They went no-huddle there.
[ct=1990.477] Back conventionally here.
[ct=2002.414] Inside handoff, Ekeler.
[ct=2003.725] He went to Western Colorado, grew up on a ranch in Colorado
[ct=2009.048] where he rode bulls with his mother.
[ct=2011.685] He did.
[ct=2013.032] That's one way to get yourself ready to become an NFL
[ct=2017.013] A little unconventional, but effective in his case.
[ct=2019.757] It helps your balance, doesn't it?
[ct=2022.197] And your toughness.
[ct=2023.543] Right.
[ct=2024.879] Which is exactly what he has as a back.
[ct=2026.215] That was no bull, by the way.
[ct=2027.533] Never mind.
[ct=2028.905] Second and 6.
[ct=2041.906] Ekeler again.
[ct=2043.281] Nice little cut back there and gets stymied.
[ct=2046.038] Oh, boy.
[ct=2047.318] And then he pays the price about a yard and a half shy.
[ct=2049.422] Nick Bolton taking over in the middle, number 32.
[ct=2053.366] And Bolton is now the main man calling the defensive signals.
[ct=2056.088] We've talked so much about Tyreek Hill not being
[ct=2059.835] in Kansas City any longer.
[ct=2061.269] But Tyrann Mathieu not being in Kansas City
[ct=2063.829] has really affected this defense with some
[ct=2065.185] of the changes they have made.
[ct=2066.560] Bolton has taken over as the leader in this defense,
[ct=2071.809] He communicates, does well, and is known for his instincts
[ct=2075.810] and physicality.
[ct=2077.134] Second-year man, played his college football
[ct=2078.354] down the road in Columbia at Missouri.
[ct=2083.557] He fires, and that's incomplete.
[ct=2086.200] He got a hand up, couldn't bring it in.
[ct=2088.895] And it will be fourth down.
[ct=2092.871] For the moment, he's going to send in the punt group.
[ct=2095.514] He ends up going after Sneed, who's, again, very, very
[ct=2099.471] good in coverage.
[ct=2100.860] He just put the ball behind him.
[ct=2103.476] Just not able to connect with Palmer.
[ct=2104.681] He puts it out in front, it's a first down.
[ct=2108.660] So JK Scott had a great game against the Raiders last week,
[ct=2114.040] former Packer.
[ct=2115.343] He played only sparingly last year
[ct=2117.984] at the end of the year with Jacksonville.
[ct=2119.355] You've got Skyy Moore, the rookie,
[ct=2120.596] calling for and making the fair catch at the 8-yard line.
[ct=2125.963] Resulted in a touchdown to make it a 3-point game.
[ct=2128.587] Off we go on this drive from the 8-yard line.
[ct=2135.484] Edwards-Helaire back in the game.
[ct=2138.070] He picks up about 4.
[ct=2139.393] Bosa makes the tackle.
[ct=2140.690] Clyde Edwards-Helaire, the ball carrier.
[ct=2142.065] Again, just such a complete player off
[ct=2146.131] the edge for the Chargers.
[ct=2147.387] He works through some traffic here,
[ct=2148.694] comes off Kelce initially, and then off of the block by Burton.
[ct=2153.988] Watch his eyes.
[ct=2155.379] He knows he's coming right at him.
[ct=2156.654] And the best thing he does not only make the play,
[ct=2159.332] forces it back into the teeth of that Chargers defense.
[ct=2167.199] Brother Nick with the 49ers, a star in his own right.
[ct=2176.465] Mahomes, they keep him in the pocket.
[ct=2177.812] He slings one to Kelce.
[ct=2179.188] He spins away and picks up the first down.
[ct=2181.795] He got away from Jackson to pick up
[ct=2184.451] the first on a gain of 9 yards, up to the 21.
[ct=2187.808] Pretty good job here protection.
[ct=2190.376] You see 5 up front.
[ct=2191.734] He creates one-on-one matchups.
[ct=2194.418] Mack to the right.
[ct=2195.729] Bosa to the left.
[ct=2197.097] Nice little window there to step up a little lane to step up
[ct=2201.102] and make that throw.
[ct=2203.675] Mack here, just trying to get home off the edge.
[ct=2206.374] He gets a little push there from Trey Smith.
[ct=2209.056] Bosa almost gets in.
[ct=2218.318] They go five wide here.
[ct=2221.016] Four-man rush again.
[ct=2222.332] Hardman spinning around.
[ct=2223.606] He turns a 3-yard gain into about an 8-yard gain,
[ct=2227.534] tackled by Bryce Callahan.
[ct=2228.899] Second down and 2.
[ct=2230.204] We talked about in the open last week, the Cardinals blitzed him.
[ct=2232.869] Played a lot of man, and they were able to be very aggressive
[ct=2235.518] and get down the field.
[ct=2236.859] Last year, everybody sat back and made them be patient.
[ct=2239.520] They knew coming in tonight against
[ct=2242.121] a Staley-coached defense, it's going to be more like last year.
[ct=2246.186] Be patient.
[ct=2247.492] Work the intermediate short passes.
[ct=2251.457] And eventually, you can work back to being explosive.
[ct=2255.450] Mahomes, as you saw, 10 of 11 for 88 yards.
[ct=2260.744] Edwards-Helaire, and he will try to fight for the first down
[ct=2264.713] but come up short.
[ct=2266.062] Drue Tranquill is there to stop him
[ct=2270.049] a yard shy of the first down.
[ct=2271.620] Third down upcoming.
[ct=2272.901] You see Bosa again setting that edge.
[ct=2274.152] Trey Smith pulling around the right guard along with Wylie,
[ct=2279.482] the right tackle.
[ct=2280.982] He blows this play up.
[ct=2282.230] He puts his foot in the ground, knows it's leverage right there.
[ct=2284.900] And that frees up Tranquill.
[ct=2286.197] Those poling linemen could not get up to the backer
[ct=2290.194] He forces third and short.
[ct=2299.494] Pacheco is the I-back.
[ct=2300.855] Give it to him.
[ct=2302.170] And it depends on the spot, but the Chargers
[ct=2304.850] are pretty sure they've stopped him.
[ct=2306.133] And they have.
[ct=2307.480] Tranquill is there again.
[ct=2310.130] Well, this is what Staley's defense wants to do.
[ct=2312.792] Get more physical at the line of scrimmage.
[ct=2315.481] Eat up the offensive linemen, and free up your linebackers.
[ct=2320.317] Look at all the action up front.
[ct=2321.699] All of this allows him to clean it up.
[ct=2325.712] Get stout at the point of attack.
[ct=2330.433] Great job.
[ct=2331.581] So you look at the third down play.
[ct=2333.335] Tranquill, the assist, of course, by Bosa, and then
[ct=2336.760] they come up with a big stop there.
[ct=2338.614] Off to a great start this season.
[ct=2339.954] He had a terrific day against Las Vegas.
[ct=2343.942] So Townsend already with his third punt of the night--
[ct=2347.941] And backing up at the 12-yard line is Carter.
[ct=2353.256] Avoids the first guy and then brings it back out
[ct=2355.930] to the 23-yard line after a 60-yard--
[ct=2360.105] Along with the commissioner on hand tonight.
[ct=2365.392] Rolling and throwing is Herbert, and that's
[ct=2369.208] close to a first down, Joshua Palmer.
[ct=2371.862] That's a power couple up there.
[ct=2373.078] I would say so.
[ct=2374.411] You and Mr. Bezos getting to the bottom of things last night.
[ct=2375.878] I think you guys were figuring some of the issues
[ct=2379.755] out in this world.
[ct=2381.019] He didn't know how to play craps.
[ct=2381.918] I go, one of the great mathematical minds in history
[ct=2386.326] can't figure that out?
[ct=2392.952] I'll teach you.
[ct=2396.946] First down up at the 33-yard line.
[ct=2403.655] Ekeler stopped just about at the line of scrimmage.
[ct=2410.342] And that's Carlos Dunlap, the longtime Bengal,
[ct=2414.241] crawls his way out of the action.
[ct=2416.916] Yeah, they're rotating some defensive linemen.
[ct=2419.530] And they want to stay fresh and healthy.
[ct=2422.242] And Dunlap is a big part of that.
[ct=2423.501] Again, another guy that's a great pass rusher but really
[ct=2427.500] He used quickness and his hands to get inside of Pipkins,
[ct=2431.498] able to collapse down.
[ct=2442.685] 4 minutes to halftime.
[ct=2446.302] Second and 9.
[ct=2447.686] Herbert gets it away before he gets hit.
[ct=2448.929] And that will be a first down, Joshua Palmer.
[ct=2451.566] Willie Gay came in that time, got to Herbert, but too late.
[ct=2455.654] And a first down for Los Angeles.
[ct=2457.222] They showed man-to-man before the snap.
[ct=2459.727] And then they brought pressure.
[ct=2460.948] Right here, they're showing man-to-man.
[ct=2463.598] They bring pressure.
[ct=2464.897] And look how far back the safety is
[ct=2466.278] once they bring that pressure.
[ct=2468.891] One of the things that you'll see Herbert do
[ct=2470.218] is recognize post-snap reads and get the ball to the right man.
[ct=2473.974] He felt the pressure and got the ball out
[ct=2475.326] just before Willie Gay could get to him.
[ct=2484.703] Back to the ground.
[ct=2486.051] Short gain, Ekeler, second down and 8.
[ct=2497.935] This is-- it's early in the season.
[ct=2500.679] Nobody's going to win anything tonight.
[ct=2501.995] But this is a pretty big game in the sense that for the Chargers,
[ct=2505.923] their schedule is pretty easy down the road.
[ct=2508.615] Meanwhile, the Chiefs opened the season
[ct=2509.920] with eight teams that had winning records last year.
[ct=2512.597] It's much, much tougher than is the Chargers.
[ct=2516.582] Not to mention, divisional game.
[ct=2519.286] Second and 8.
[ct=2524.552] They give it to him, able to maintain his balance.
[ct=2528.534] And again, this division is so tough, the AFC West.
[ct=2532.624] But I know it's early, obviously.
[ct=2535.221] The season is 20 minutes old.
[ct=2535.313] But the team that wins tonight's game
[ct=2537.870] will be the only undefeated team in the division.
[ct=2540.559] I'm with you.
[ct=2540.762] And I think you're looking at maybe the more complete teams,
[ct=2544.544] at least on paper, in this division.
[ct=2547.202] So when you go head to head with the Chargers and the Chiefs
[ct=2549.515] this year, it's very important no matter what point
[ct=2553.808] in the season you're playing.
[ct=2555.145] This Chargers team, they've reshuffled the deck,
[ct=2557.792] made a lot of changes.
[ct=2559.116] And they have come into this game in this season
[ct=2561.311] with a lot of confidence.
[ct=2563.120] Not just with Herbert, but the changes they made on defense.
[ct=2565.793] Two-minute warning.
[ct=2567.104] A special look now at WhatsApp's--
[ct=2571.104] Third down and 1.
[ct=2572.420] 2 minutes to the half.
[ct=2575.093] Herbert keeping his eyes downfield.
[ct=2579.048] No, he cannot.
[ct=2580.432] And he's taken down at the 47-yard line.
[ct=2583.042] So now with Carlos Dunlap there, it is going to be--
[ct=2588.342] Well, it's a heck of a call here with Patrick Mahomes
[ct=2592.311] on the other sideline.
[ct=2593.011] Right, fourth and 2.
[ct=2593.270] We'll see what Staley wants to do.
[ct=2594.993] And I think it's because of who he's playing and the way his
[ct=2599.207] team is up right now 10-7.
[ct=2601.653] You would normally think he would go for this, but no way.
[ct=2604.281] You don't want to give Mahomes if you don't
[ct=2605.814] make it that field position.
[ct=2608.284] Andy Reid could take a timeout here as well.
[ct=2612.469] Remember, the Chargers deferred.
[ct=2613.585] They get the ball to start the second half.
[ct=2615.035] They were thinking about points there and then getting the ball
[ct=2618.906] 2 for 1.
[ct=2621.074] JK Scott.
[ct=2625.189] At this point on the field, they could have taken the delay.
[ct=2628.308] it wouldn't have mattered.
[ct=2629.525] But do they get it away?
[ct=2631.022] Moore is back there.
[ct=2633.100] He lets it bounce at the 5.
[ct=2634.849] And it takes a fairly good Los Angeles bounce.
[ct=2636.938] At least it doesn't go into the end zone.
[ct=2640.153] It's down inside the 15.
[ct=2642.817] Andy Reid could have taken the timeout there.
[ct=2644.424] You think that he might have--
[ct=2645.523] It makes you wonder what they're going to do here
[ct=2648.153] now back inside their own 15.
[ct=2650.800] But I think we're all surprised.
[ct=2652.330] They didn't use that timeout, save a little time.
[ct=2654.860] They have all three for what it's worth right now.
[ct=2658.147] Mahomes starts this one from the 13-yard line.
[ct=2662.701] And the pressure is on.
[ct=2664.041] And the pass is thrown into the Chiefs' bench.
[ct=2668.037] And you've got a flag at the 6-yard line.
[ct=2670.754] I think it's going to be on Bosa who came and submarined him.
[ct=2676.022] Obviously, they take care of these quarterbacks.
[ct=2678.678] And Joey Bosa is off really a big night.
[ct=2682.628] Holding, offense, number 77.
[ct=2686.624] Wow.
[ct=2688.010] He pulled the defender into the quarterback.
[ct=2690.586] Half the distance the goal, first down.
[ct=2693.314] Friendly fire.
[ct=2694.043] He grabs his jersey and actually pulls him down.
[ct=2697.319] I thought it might have just been Bosa
[ct=2698.736] losing his balance at the end.
[ct=2700.148] But you can clearly see Wylie, who's
[ct=2702.570] got his hands full against Bosa.
[ct=2705.240] Watch near the end of this.
[ct=2706.551] He grabs that jersey.
[ct=2707.920] And you couldn't quite see that.
[ct=2710.519] That was an interesting look at it there.
[ct=2712.183] Well--
[ct=2713.230] Watch here.
[ct=2713.362] Watch.
[ct=2714.053] He gets hold of the jersey there.
[ct=2715.886] And then you don't really see him pull him down.
[ct=2723.817] Terry McAulay is telling us, shaky, shaky call.
[ct=2727.814] First and 16 now.
[ct=2729.266] Juggling catch is made.
[ct=2730.479] That's JuJu Smith-Schuster up at the 11-yard line.
[ct=2734.009] And they'll race up to the line here with 12 yards
[ct=2744.978] to go on second down.
[ct=2745.373] And that catch is made and then spun out is Valdes-Scantling.
[ct=2751.610] So it'll be third down now.
[ct=2752.927] The clock stopped with 27 seconds.
[ct=2754.356] Of course, Andy Reid has such confidence in Mahomes.
[ct=2758.239] But it does make me go back to that fourth down at midfield
[ct=2761.798] when they allowed some time to go off.
[ct=2766.199] You're looking at 27 seconds here.
[ct=2768.871] And they have not done a good job
[ct=2769.638] of getting the ball thrown downfield
[ct=2771.511] against this defense, who's just sitting back
[ct=2773.879] and keeping everything in front.
[ct=2775.497] Stopping here, and Staley can call a timeout.
[ct=2787.659] Mahomes, and that's incomplete.
[ct=2791.430] And so you've got 22 seconds.
[ct=2792.786] And the Chargers don't even have to take a timeout.
[ct=2795.682] No, they don't.
[ct=2799.356] Crowd's still upset about the penalty.
[ct=2811.393] Andy trying to figure it out too.
[ct=2814.059] Talking to Carl Johnson, who at one time
[ct=2815.356] was the head of officials in the National Football League.
[ct=2820.696] Crowd is still exercised.
[ct=2823.314] Meanwhile, Townsend with his fourth punt and letting it
[ct=2828.896] bounce.
[ct=2830.018] And that's going to take us almost to halftime.
[ct=2837.463] 6 seconds.
[ct=2841.728] And we're back in 30 seconds.
[ct=2845.873] Tom, you saw the Chiefs punt four times and a half.
[ct=2851.208] Right?
[ct=2851.479] Kneel down will end it.
[ct=2852.535] The Chargers get the ball to start the second half.
[ct=2856.523] Entertaining first half.
[ct=2857.375] Brandon Staley up 10-7 on the road.
[ct=2860.522] We'll take that.
[ct=2861.261] Coming up after the break, the Mercedes-Benz Halftime--
[ct=2864.497] So Matt Ammendola to kick off, the newly acquired kicker.
[ct=2869.884] And he boots that one through the end zone for a touchback.
[ct=2873.300] Couple of minutes ago when he came out of the locker room,
[ct=2876.468] Kaylee talked to Brandon Staley.
[ct=2879.098] Coach, you kept Arrowhead pretty quiet for a quarter.
[ct=2883.082] What is the key to continuing to keep
[ct=2884.417] Patrick Mahomes in his offense from getting downfield?
[ct=2887.085] We just got to play team defense.
[ct=2887.302] We got to have all three levels playing together.
[ct=2889.371] We got to play a lot of people, stay fresh.
[ct=2892.157] It's going to take everybody in order to finish this.
[ct=2893.743] Your offense scored on the first two drives.
[ct=2896.168] How do you get them going again?
[ct=2897.104] Yeah, I like the way we played offensively.
[ct=2900.168] I feel like we're moving the ball at a high level.
[ct=2901.514] I think the best thing that we're doing
[ct=2902.763] is we're really secure with the football right now.
[ct=2904.792] We've got to keep doing that.
[ct=2905.495] And I think if we do that, that'll
[ct=2906.789] be a big thing for us in the second half.
[ct=2909.490] So they start from the 25.
[ct=2910.756] Meanwhile, you've got Will Clapp now in at center.
[ct=2914.807] So Corey Linsley does not make the start here
[ct=2917.405] in the second half.
[ct=2918.713] We have to check on that.
[ct=2920.045] They got a silent count going, and there he is.
[ct=2922.674] And that's something to keep an eye on.
[ct=2924.064] Corey Linsley, one of the top centers in the NFL
[ct=2928.015] and one of the best run-blocking centers.
[ct=2932.029] Second and 8, they go quickly.
[ct=2935.993] Nice catch, a contested catch.
[ct=2937.361] A yard shy of the first down.
[ct=2939.973] Gerald Everett tackled there by Willie Gay.
[ct=2942.021] Third and 1.
[ct=2945.321] Gives them a chance here.
[ct=2945.430] He had Frank Clark closing in on him.
[ct=2947.981] They're going to go tempo here, but a nice job of changing
[ct=2950.587] his arm angle.
[ct=2953.295] Ekeler, can he get the first?
[ct=2954.795] Yes, he can.
[ct=2956.011] Tell you what, you're going tempo.
[ct=2958.073] You got a new center in there, silent count.
[ct=2960.002] You got a lot of stuff going on right now.
[ct=2962.554] When you get like this, you feel like you're
[ct=2963.880] doing a Big 12 game, going back to these college games
[ct=2966.177] that I do.
[ct=2967.513] The tempo is fast.
[ct=2967.621] And one of the things that puts a lot of pressure
[ct=2970.218] on a defense to communicate, make sure everybody's gaps
[ct=2974.200] sound, especially on third down for Steve
[ct=2975.551] Spagnuolo, the defensive coordinator here in Kansas City.
[ct=2979.479] Thank God they don't stop the clock after every first down.
[ct=2981.570] We'll be here till midnight.
[ct=2983.473] Tell me about it.
[ct=2986.163] I live it.
[ct=2987.457] From the 41-yard line, Herbert looks back the other way.
[ct=2991.428] Dangerous pass, but gets away with it.
[ct=2992.779] And Ekeler has a lot of room to roam
[ct=2993.925] and finally gets taken out of bounds after a long game.
[ct=2998.114] He got away from Willie Gay.
[ct=3000.756] Dangerous pass, but it works.
[ct=3002.056] Dangerous and give credit to Willie Gay.
[ct=3004.682] He just didn't finish the play.
[ct=3005.927] He stayed home, was not fooled at all.
[ct=3008.632] Really, the only Chiefs defender that
[ct=3009.915] did not move with the action.
[ct=3012.622] And this is what makes Ekeler so tough.
[ct=3013.432] He can catch the ball, but he's hard to bring down by one guy.
[ct=3017.924] Gay had a chance at him.
[ct=3019.315] But look at him.
[ct=3020.595] He shakes, shows you how tough he
[ct=3021.879] is from riding those bulls you talked
[ct=3024.554] about growing up with his mom.
[ct=3025.294] He keeps that balance from the 41-yard line.
[ct=3031.393] Fake it to Kelley, and then the pass is batted.
[ct=3034.120] Trying to throw it to Kelley, batted by Chris Jones.
[ct=3045.767] Fired, caught, that's Mike Williams
[ct=3049.012] inside the 30 and another Charger first down.
[ct=3052.754] Yeah, they're just feeling this.
[ct=3054.027] When Kansas City is playing zone,
[ct=3056.473] watch Mike Williams run and then just sit there.
[ct=3059.089] The action takes the linebackers away, creates a nice lane there.
[ct=3063.168] And that's the zip that you see from Herbert
[ct=3067.044] along with the accuracy.
[ct=3068.396] That combination as we've seen here in these first three years
[ct=3071.062] from Herbert in this offense is a lethal combination.
[ct=3075.073] And Mike Williams has really stepped up tonight
[ct=3077.138] in the absence of Keenan Allen.
[ct=3081.209] On the ground, cutting it back, nice move there.
[ct=3084.329] Joshua Kelley, third-year back, played his college ball at UCLA.
[ct=3090.963] We talked about that vision.
[ct=3091.252] We saw Michel have a very similar run early in this game.
[ct=3094.966] He cuts back to the right.
[ct=3096.251] Nice job on the right side of sustaining those blocks.
[ct=3100.237] Here they go fast again.
[ct=3101.581] Kelley again.
[ct=3102.958] It looks like he's a little short.
[ct=3104.550] To Kaylee, we go.
[ct=3105.206] Al, you don't see center Corey Linsley in there
[ct=3108.212] with the Chargers.
[ct=3108.427] The team tells us they're looking into a knee injury.
[ct=3112.243] Yeah, they've got Clapp in there right from the get go,
[ct=3116.243] number 76.
[ct=3117.540] He was a free agent pickup from the Saints in the offseason.
[ct=3125.758] It's a third and 1.
[ct=3126.862] Knowing Staley, are you talking about fourth downs here?
[ct=3130.813] Yeah, and you wonder, do you go the conventional way
[ct=3134.761] Or do you try to catch them off and hit a play-action pass?
[ct=3141.451] Horvath, the fullback, flip it back to Ekeler.
[ct=3144.754] And Ekeler fights his way.
[ct=3148.063] Does he get it?
[ct=3148.153] We'll see where they spot it.
[ct=3150.709] Got him in bounds.
[ct=3150.851] It looks to be a little bit short.
[ct=3152.047] That's Nick Bolton covering on the play.
[ct=3156.700] Good job of this getting turned back inside.
[ct=3161.296] Just on the edge there, Justin Reid forces it back.
[ct=3164.058] And nobody is able to climb up to Nick Bolton.
[ct=3166.643] He can get sideline to sideline in a hurry.
[ct=3168.219] The leader of that front keeps him short of the first.
[ct=3173.533] And they will go for it.
[ct=3174.866] Line up anyway to do it.
[ct=3176.169] Fourth down and inches.
[ct=3178.626] Staley says, if nothing else, it's
[ct=3179.946] a mindset I want my team to have.
[ct=3181.911] We're going to be aggressive.
[ct=3183.948] Give it to Ekeler, and he is able to find his way
[ct=3189.108] across the line to gain.
[ct=3191.826] I think that's so important when he
[ct=3193.116] talks about having that spirit, just an attitude
[ct=3196.052] to create a fearless approach.
[ct=3198.453] And we saw Brian Daboll, that worked out with the New York
[ct=3200.953] Giants this past weekend.
[ct=3201.944] Players feed off of their coaches believing in them.
[ct=3205.536] And this is big to keep this drive alive.
[ct=3207.673] Instead of settling for the field goal on the road up 3,
[ct=3211.685] You get in the red zone, and now you're trying to get 6.
[ct=3220.905] Chargers have had the ball for 5 minutes.
[ct=3222.476] This is the 11th play of this drive.
[ct=3227.502] To the end zone, he goes.
[ct=3229.090] And can he one-hand it in the end zone to Mike Williams?
[ct=3234.204] Yes.
[ct=3236.817] Mike Williams, what a night.
[ct=3241.099] Signed a new long-term lucrative deal in the offseason,
[ct=3245.000] paying a huge dividend tonight.
[ct=3247.445] And he takes Sneed to the outside.
[ct=3249.813] Usually, that's slot corner.
[ct=3251.438] By the way, he's in phase.
[ct=3252.773] Pretty good coverage, kind of that slow release.
[ct=3256.762] But look at the location.
[ct=3258.080] Unbelievable catch to get the right hand down
[ct=3261.455] and makes that catch.
[ct=3262.126] But the location of the ball gives him a chance.
[ct=3265.482] Pretty tight coverage by Sneed.
[ct=3267.401] Right hand, right buttock as well.
[ct=3269.907] Yeah, that's right.
[ct=3275.244] To paraphrase John Madden, one buttock equals two feet, right?
[ct=3279.235] You're in bounds.
[ct=3280.571] And in this case, 6 points.
[ct=3282.219] Hopkins for the extra point.
[ct=3283.212] So the Chargers come out of the gate with a new center--
[ct=3287.217] no problem.
[ct=3288.547] 11 plays, 75 yards, and the Chargers
[ct=3292.548] lead by 10 at Arrowhead.
[ct=3297.095] Oh, yeah.
[ct=3297.806] The Chiefs--
[ct=3300.772] When the Royals won the World Series back in '85--
[ct=3304.488] You were on the call?
[ct=3307.272] I'm here for everything.
[ct=3308.473] Mike Williams, second visiting player 100 or more yards,
[ct=3311.136] three straight games in Arrowhead.
[ct=3314.031] Touchdown here.
[ct=3316.436] What concentration again.
[ct=3317.354] He gets the right arm down.
[ct=3319.106] He takes care of the right buttocks.
[ct=3321.214] As you said, he gets in.
[ct=3323.073] His mom, Francine, his girlfriend,
[ct=3325.092] Farrah, they get the ball.
[ct=3327.052] Yep.
[ct=3328.627] And now Mahomes has the ball for the first time
[ct=3337.676] Keep in the pocket.
[ct=3339.032] He gets hit as he throws.
[ct=3340.299] Deep downfield, contested, and a flag is thrown.
[ct=3344.296] So it's picked here by James.
[ct=3345.909] But you saw the flag.
[ct=3346.876] And Hardman is down and writhing and rolling around
[ct=3350.866] and limping off the field.
[ct=3352.171] You don't find the football, and it's an underthrown ball,
[ct=3354.848] there's going to be pass interference on the defense.
[ct=3360.990] So he takes it all the way, and you've got two flags.
[ct=3366.839] Adderley.
[ct=3368.122] You also have two-- you have two flags back
[ct=3370.786] near the line of scrimmage.
[ct=3372.113] There are two fouls on the play, one by each team.
[ct=3374.724] Holding, offense, number 57.
[ct=3378.729] Pass interference, defense, number 24.
[ct=3382.704] By rule, those fouls will offset.
[ct=3386.723] Have you ever seen four flags on the field?
[ct=3388.815] No.
[ct=3389.370] Only two calls, though.
[ct=3392.231] Here's the obvious pass interference.
[ct=3393.386] An underthrown ball where you see Hardman try to work back.
[ct=3398.639] But apparently, they're not-- no, he doesn't locate the ball.
[ct=3401.365] And then the big man, Orlando Brown going against Bosa.
[ct=3403.958] Clearly it's one way to slow down 97, just grab on
[ct=3407.960] to that jersey to prevent him from getting
[ct=3409.341] to your quarterback.
[ct=3410.611] [pa announcement]
[ct=3413.547] Austin Johnson put a lick on Mahomes on that play.
[ct=3418.587] Second time he's done that tonight.
[ct=3421.282] Mahomes backs up.
[ct=3423.939] Fires and that's nearly picked.
[ct=3425.984] And maybe it--
[ct=3427.882] Samuel, does he come up with it?
[ct=3430.519] Did it hit the ground?
[ct=3431.880] He thinks he's picked it.
[ct=3433.427] The question is, did it hit the ground or not?
[ct=3436.147] Mahomes is walking away as if I know it's an interception.
[ct=3439.740] And it is.
[ct=3441.031] What a play by Asante Samuel.
[ct=3443.751] And I think this is a miscommunication.
[ct=3445.008] Kelce is supposed to continue to come down flat, at least that's
[ct=3449.859] what Mahomes thought.
[ct=3451.724] Ooh, yeah.
[ct=3452.078] That's Terry McAulay.
[ct=3453.648] You're watching this with us.
[ct=3455.688] Bobbled, juggle.
[ct=3457.711] Does the ground help it control it, Terry?
[ct=3460.998] He does not get control before the ball hits the ground.
[ct=3463.649] It's an incomplete pass, Al.
[ct=3466.324] --little fingers on it there.
[ct=3467.629] And then he loses control and it hits the ground.
[ct=3469.888] So Hussey is going to hold up play
[ct=3472.932] because the Chargers have come out on offense
[ct=3475.730] and the Chiefs have come out on defense.
[ct=3478.398] [upbeat music]
[ct=3482.311] It's under review.
[ct=3483.281] Here it is.
[ct=3486.270] All turnovers, as you know, get reviewed.
[ct=3488.895] After review, the defender did not complete the catch.
[ct=3493.637] The ball hit the ground.
[ct=3494.504] Therefore, it is an incomplete pass.
[ct=3496.889] Will the game clock operator please set the game clock
[ct=3499.717] to 9:38, please.
[ct=3501.685] 9:38.
[ct=3502.225] And it will be second down.
[ct=3505.611] I think the most important thing I've
[ct=3507.476] taken away here to start this second half for the Chiefs is
[ct=3510.175] Mahomes looks a bit unsettled in that pocket.
[ct=3513.917] Two, now, forced throws to start this second half.
[ct=3518.151] Well, every team, or most teams, anyway,
[ct=3520.791] say we've got to keep Mahomes in the pocket.
[ct=3522.426] Chargers have done that tonight.
[ct=3524.791] They sure have.
[ct=3534.120] Quick pass.
[ct=3535.387] And that will be a first down as he goes to Noah Gray,
[ct=3540.729] number two tight end.
[ct=3542.206] And that's a first down.
[ct=3543.410] And going back to a bread and butter play, quick slant.
[ct=3547.366] Take the back out into the flat.
[ct=3548.696] Linebacker clears out because he has
[ct=3551.228] to respect the threat to the out onto the edge.
[ct=3553.316] Makes it really easy for Mahomes to throw in rhythm there.
[ct=3557.180] Maybe that'll get him going.
[ct=3567.205] Good protection again.
[ct=3568.372] This time it's Smith-Schuster.
[ct=3569.719] [whistle blows]
[ct=3571.071] They ride him right into the Charger bench, does JC Jackson.
[ct=3575.028] So Smith-Schuster, some good years in Pittsburgh.
[ct=3577.948] Kind of an underneath guy.
[ct=3579.033] When they sent Hill to Miami, they needed an underneath guy.
[ct=3584.323] And an over the top guy, and that's
[ct=3585.684] why they got Valdes-Scantling from Green Bay.
[ct=3588.303] Well, right now Valdes-Scantling is not getting downfield
[ct=3591.019] because the Chargers are doing what a lot of teams
[ct=3593.618] did last year.
[ct=3594.947] They're making Mahomes be patient and have
[ct=3596.322] to take what the defense is giving him, which is, again,
[ct=3600.275] Nothing downfield at all.
[ct=3602.996] Second down and 8.
[ct=3604.936] That's caught on the run.
[ct=3606.927] And busting his way out of a tackle Edwards-Helaire
[ct=3609.743] to the Los Angeles 41-yard line and a first down.
[ct=3613.443] And when teams do this, Mahomes is doing what he should do.
[ct=3617.443] You've got to have yards after the catch.
[ct=3620.413] Blitz the middle linebacker.
[ct=3622.737] Easy opening underneath.
[ct=3624.086] And it's one thing to catch it.
[ct=3624.194] Now you've got to break away from Derwin James,
[ct=3626.701] pull away from Drew Tranquill, and pick up
[ct=3630.667] some really good yards.
[ct=3632.016] So that's the answer, running the football,
[ct=3634.667] underneath throws, and then your receivers,
[ct=3637.108] and running backs, and tight ends making some things happen
[ct=3639.805] and breaking some tackles for you.
[ct=3645.150] [calling audible]
[ct=3646.481] McKinnon in the backfield.
[ct=3653.823] Surveying, pressured.
[ct=3657.076] And just flips that one away.
[ct=3659.788] And the punter makes the catch on the sideline.
[ct=3662.433] Second down.
[ct=3663.863] Just a great rush here.
[ct=3665.073] Nobody gets out of their lanes.
[ct=3667.785] You get a good push here initially
[ct=3669.054] in the inside by Morgan Fox.
[ct=3671.726] But everybody doing their job.
[ct=3673.728] Rumph to the left.
[ct=3674.372] Doesn't allow him to break contain.
[ct=3676.996] Forces him into the boundary.
[ct=3677.870] Just nothing that Mahomes could do.
[ct=3679.730] Great group effort rushing as a defensive unit.
[ct=3684.995] And very little blitzing.
[ct=3691.681] Hardman is back in the game after he limped off.
[ct=3699.588] That's fired.
[ct=3699.814] And a little bit behind Hardman, who I just mentioned,
[ct=3703.729] back in the game.
[ct=3704.904] Third and 10.
[ct=3705.110] We check in with Kaylee again.
[ct=3706.387] Al, Hardman looked to be in a lot of pain
[ct=3708.890] when he came limping off the field.
[ct=3709.871] But they taped up his left heel.
[ct=3711.535] They put some padded heel cuffs right to his skin.
[ct=3714.472] We saw him slip that shoe back on, work it out.
[ct=3717.093] And as a sprinter, he's going to be on his toes a lot.
[ct=3719.662] But changing direction, that's when
[ct=3721.045] he's going to be putting more pressure on his heel.
[ct=3723.497] Look out for that.
[ct=3724.869] Kaylee, he just came off the field.
[ct=3725.022] So one play and he says, I need to be checked out here.
[ct=3729.032] Justin Watson comes in his place.
[ct=3736.790] This time they send an extra man.
[ct=3739.453] Mahomes gets away.
[ct=3740.761] To the end zone, caught!
[ct=3742.132] Watson, touchdown!
[ct=3745.596] [firecrackers bursting]
[ct=3751.393] He beats Jackson.
[ct=3753.530] And this is the guy who comes into the game
[ct=3755.387] because Hardman came out of the game on that play.
[ct=3758.214] Well, he's got great chemistry with Patrick Mahomes.
[ct=3764.690] The difference here is they allowed
[ct=3765.600] him to step up in the pocket.
[ct=3767.447] This is one-on-one.
[ct=3768.689] He turns JC Jackson, the premier corner in the NFL.
[ct=3772.656] It's a heck of a route there to get him to turn.
[ct=3775.237] But credit the offensive line for giving him
[ct=3778.209] enough room to step up.
[ct=3779.429] Bosa went wide.
[ct=3780.547] We just talked about a team rush.
[ct=3783.153] That time they didn't.
[ct=3784.469] Ammendola's kick is good to convert.
[ct=3787.165] Watson with his first touchdown since he
[ct=3789.453] played with the Bucs back in 2019.
[ct=3793.401] So they get a break on the overturned interception.
[ct=3798.048] Cash in.
[ct=3800.487] 17-14.
[ct=3801.762] --list.
[ct=3803.089] Back to the touchdown we go.
[ct=3804.442] Yeah, that's what we just talked about how they rushed as a unit.
[ct=3807.131] This time they didn't.
[ct=3808.501] You get pressure on the outside.
[ct=3809.337] You get a blitz right here.
[ct=3811.073] But watch how the lanes open up and allow Mahomes.
[ct=3813.136] They haven't been blitzing much.
[ct=3815.066] When they do, he makes them pay for it.
[ct=3816.331] Look at him look right.
[ct=3817.119] Comes back to the left and sees a one-on-one match-up
[ct=3820.321] and gets it to Watson.
[ct=3821.674] Watch him how he just flips this thing.
[ct=3824.333] Typical Mahomes.
[ct=3825.679] Give him room, 45 yards, a little flip of the wrist.
[ct=3829.048] Touchdown, Chiefs.
[ct=3832.728] That's already 7 touchdown passes for him in a game
[ct=3838.962] and almost 3/4.
[ct=3841.124] Chargers start with Sony Michel as the running back.
[ct=3844.255] They used Ekeler, Kelley, and Michel in that role tonight.
[ct=3848.348] And the former Patriot and Ram picks up 2.
[ct=3852.285] Place coming alive here a little bit on Herbert.
[ct=3854.901] They've done a good job of mixing their tempos.
[ct=3857.845] He's been under center.
[ct=3858.908] He's been in the gun.
[ct=3860.168] Different formations.
[ct=3860.836] Joe Lombardi calling a heck of a game tonight
[ct=3862.899] for this Chargers offense, leaning on Herbert.
[ct=3870.022] And they run the hurry up.
[ct=3871.857] And that's caught and set a third and short.
[ct=3875.840] Chris Jones, the great defensive tackle for Kansas City,
[ct=3881.260] haven't really called his name tonight.
[ct=3883.806] No, he had the one deflected pass.
[ct=3885.106] But I'll tell you, man, the rookie from Boston College,
[ct=3887.681] Zion Johnson doing a really good job
[ct=3889.728] against one of the top interior players in the League.
[ct=3894.363] Zion Johnson.
[ct=3895.659] And that will be incomplete.
[ct=3899.510] Justin Reid breaks it up.
[ct=3901.556] Came over from the Texans.
[ct=3904.853] And it's fourth down.
[ct=3904.996] We just talked about Zion Johnson going up
[ct=3908.813] against Chris Jones.
[ct=3908.982] And we wondered coming in how he would hold up.
[ct=3912.806] 77 right there in the middle.
[ct=3915.427] Gives his quarterback enough time.
[ct=3918.158] But give credit to the Chiefs on the back end,
[ct=3920.763] anticipating a short throw.
[ct=3922.147] And Reid, a veteran, does a nice job of coming up.
[ct=3925.608] Times it up perfectly against Gerald Everett.
[ct=3931.779] JK Scott sends it into the night air.
[ct=3934.313] Fair catch called for, made by Skyy Moore at the 30-yard line.
[ct=3940.691] 6:24 left in the third.
[ct=3943.337] A 3-point game in Kansas City.
[ct=3945.342] --in high school and college.
[ct=3946.127] Yeah, what an impressive, sharp young head coach
[ct=3951.120] that has a lot of confidence in his team.
[ct=3953.950] Great leader.
[ct=3955.134] One of the four guys already off the Sean McVay coaching tree.
[ct=3960.390] Play fake.
[ct=3960.510] Play action.
[ct=3961.346] And Valdes-Scantling makes the catch here.
[ct=3965.710] And you see this where it's not called in the huddle.
[ct=3968.323] They're going to run play with an alert.
[ct=3969.945] If he sees a soft corner, how many times
[ct=3972.358] have you seen 15 do that?
[ct=3973.565] He's just looking at that offensive line.
[ct=3976.207] They have no idea that Mahomes is going to pull out of there
[ct=3980.182] And instead of running that play, pick up an easy 7 or 8
[ct=3982.870] yards by just flipping it out to your receiver
[ct=3985.034] with a soft coverage.
[ct=3988.466] Second and 3.
[ct=4000.032] Cutting it back.
[ct=4001.381] Keeps those legs going.
[ct=4002.686] But Edwards-Helaire does not have enough for the first down.
[ct=4006.272] So it will be third down about a yard and a half.
[ct=4008.860] Chargers coming in tonight trying
[ct=4010.620] to make Mahomes and this Chiefs offense one-dimensional.
[ct=4014.410] Talked about him earlier, Khalil Mack
[ct=4016.045] known for his pass rush ability.
[ct=4017.893] 3 sacks last week against the Raiders.
[ct=4019.751] But when you talk to him, he is probably more excited and proud
[ct=4023.803] to talk about his ability to defend the run than rush
[ct=4027.717] the quarterback.
[ct=4027.956] Good job of getting down eyes in that backfield
[ct=4029.902] and keeping them short of the first.
[ct=4032.991] KC 3 of 7 on third down.
[ct=4037.100] Mahomes to the air.
[ct=4039.696] Throws too high and incomplete.
[ct=4042.301] Tried to get that one to Valdes-Scantling.
[ct=4044.988] And helping to bust up that play was Kyle Van Noy.
[ct=4047.636] Yeah, this is what you've got to deal with.
[ct=4049.754] Whether it's Derwin James or Van Noy,
[ct=4051.583] you get caught up on third down of the edge, right?
[ct=4054.030] What are we going to do about Bosa?
[ct=4055.604] And all of a sudden, you've got to deal with this.
[ct=4057.849] You've got Mack on the edge, Bosa on the edge.
[ct=4060.891] And then you've got Van Noy, who's
[ct=4062.235] known as an edge guy in New England,
[ct=4063.617] but has been playing off the ball as a middle linebacker
[ct=4067.516] Shows you his versatility and he knows
[ct=4070.043] how to rush the quarterback.
[ct=4071.514] Townsend with his fifth punt.
[ct=4071.778] He'll lead the league in punting after this week.
[ct=4073.727] Averaging 57.3 tonight, in good measure thanks to that
[ct=4079.184] 74-yarder.
[ct=4080.669] He boots it a mile high.
[ct=4083.167] Fielded at the 9-yard line and fair caught there by Carter.
[ct=4089.903] Justin Herbert has done a really good job
[ct=4092.483] without Keenan Allen of being able to find Mike Williams.
[ct=4095.119] Take a look at our Next Gen Stats powered by AWS.
[ct=4098.189] We know that he can make contested catches downfield.
[ct=4101.288] But I think he felt a sense of pressure.
[ct=4103.114] He's got the big contract coming into this year.
[ct=4105.735] What's he been able to do?
[ct=4106.950] Win one-on-one matchups.
[ct=4108.248] Find the soft spot in the zone.
[ct=4109.559] And of course, comes up with that touchdown.
[ct=4113.262] He's had a heck of a night.
[ct=4113.567] And he's going to have to finish strong if the Chargers want
[ct=4116.190] to get out of here with a win.
[ct=4118.874] That last punt by Townsend, 53 yards.
[ct=4122.875] Backs him up to the 9-yard line to begin this drive.
[ct=4125.014] Under 5 to play in the third.
[ct=4128.127] And Herbert has to get it away in a hurry
[ct=4128.889] because that's the rookie out of Purdue, George Karlaftis, who
[ct=4134.764] forced that issue.
[ct=4136.151] These coaches love what they have
[ct=4137.452] seen from the rookie in camp.
[ct=4138.838] They think that he has a chance to be a major contributor
[ct=4142.743] and add depth.
[ct=4144.093] Eventually could become the guy.
[ct=4145.457] Watch his discipline to stay home.
[ct=4146.904] Knows there's that threat of the boot coming to the backside.
[ct=4150.740] Gets right into the face there of Herbert.
[ct=4152.048] Nothing Herbert can do other than just throw that ball away.
[ct=4158.682] Big fella out of Purdue.
[ct=4161.362] Now the crowd totally into it.
[ct=4171.535] Off the fake.
[ct=4172.916] Look out from behind.
[ct=4173.087] Gets it away.
[ct=4174.241] Broken up.
[ct=4175.512] Sneed came in from the corner and helped
[ct=4179.486] to break that play up.
[ct=4180.824] It's third down and 10.
[ct=4182.205] Yeah, he wanted to throw that ball initially
[ct=4184.819] to the outside to Palmer, who was coming in motion.
[ct=4188.818] Got him out in the flat.
[ct=4189.682] He pumped, pumped.
[ct=4190.392] But I think just the presence of Watson
[ct=4192.953] prevented him from pulling the trigger.
[ct=4195.458] Snap it quickly to try to neutralize that crowd noise.
[ct=4199.456] Look out.
[ct=4200.762] But he gets out of the end zone.
[ct=4202.209] And Chris Jones is there.
[ct=4207.296] So Jones makes his biggest play of the night.
[ct=4212.623] And now he can't beat the rookie,
[ct=4213.673] so they move him to the other side against Feiler.
[ct=4216.646] And this is what you're used to seeing.
[ct=4219.268] Oh, my gosh!
[ct=4219.505] The sudden movement from a man of his size at 6' 6".
[ct=4224.622] Well, he used to eat nothing but junk food.
[ct=4226.128] Then he told us he's eating healthy.
[ct=4228.749] He's a foodie right now.
[ct=4231.206] He's lean.
[ct=4232.527] He's giving us this play-by-play yesterday.
[ct=4235.208] I bought it, too, until I saw him on a McDonald's commercial
[ct=4237.815] on the news last night.
[ct=4243.151] Short kick.
[ct=4243.175] Fair caught up at the 35-yard line by Skyy Moore.
[ct=4247.271] So you had JK Scott with a short kick.
[ct=4252.463] He was pinned up against the back line of the end zone.
[ct=4257.277] [inaudible] And your punting game.
[ct=4259.012] Two three and outs in a row for the Chargers.
[ct=4262.975] Now you give Mahomes incredible field position here.
[ct=4268.277] And you would say you're in field goal shape
[ct=4270.939] right now with Butker.
[ct=4272.238] But who knows with Ammendola?
[ct=4274.909] Two tight ends in this set.
[ct=4278.933] Pressure put on from behind.
[ct=4281.270] And that's incomplete.
[ct=4282.943] He had Khalil Mack coming the great circle route to force him.
[ct=4286.889] You know who has had a quiet night
[ct=4288.817] and you expect that to maybe change is Kelce.
[ct=4292.163] Usually in these situations in the game,
[ct=4294.697] this is where Mahomes starts to look for 87, right?
[ct=4298.202] Even if Derwin James, who's a great match-up.
[ct=4300.170] If James is on him, he's got to get separation.
[ct=4303.894] He's got to win.
[ct=4305.260] But I wouldn't be shocked here on this drive,
[ct=4307.886] late in the game, he's been quiet,
[ct=4309.185] try to get him going here.
[ct=4310.584] Only 3 catches for 33 yards.
[ct=4315.908] Second down and 10.
[ct=4317.165] They flare it out to Edwards-Helaire.
[ct=4318.124] And that is read beautifully by Asante Samuel Jr.
[ct=4321.906] Dad of course played for many years
[ct=4323.840] with New England and Philadelphia.
[ct=4325.169] Had a great career.
[ct=4326.185] Sitting back again with two safeties back deep.
[ct=4329.115] Puts a lot of pressure on these corners
[ct=4330.463] to have to react and make plays up close and make tackles.
[ct=4333.855] Big emphasis this week by Brandon Staley.
[ct=4335.789] We're going to sit and make everything go in front.
[ct=4337.985] But we cannot allow them to catch the ball and get yards
[ct=4341.095] after the catch.
[ct=4342.054] Put a lot on these linebackers and corners
[ct=4345.045] to make plays like that.
[ct=4348.980] Hardman is back in the game for the Chiefs.
[ct=4354.290] Mahomes stepping up, fires.
[ct=4356.946] And that's low.
[ct=4358.272] And is it caught?
[ct=4359.596] They say yes, by Hardman.
[ct=4362.291] Brought it in.
[ct=4363.575] Well designed play with a spacing from Andy Reid
[ct=4367.588] to give Mahomes a chance.
[ct=4368.857] And Hardman is able to sit in here.
[ct=4371.776] Sits back.
[ct=4372.843] Just kind of sits right here, right in between.
[ct=4375.489] You've got all this spacing.
[ct=4376.847] You've got a linebacker.
[ct=4377.815] You've got the nickel.
[ct=4379.511] You've got this corner.
[ct=4380.858] Everybody spread out creates a nice hole there.
[ct=4383.460] And Hardman just settles in just a yard or two past the sticks.
[ct=4386.458] And Mahomes puts it right on him for the first.
[ct=4389.653] Needed 10.
[ct=4390.194] Got 11.
[ct=4394.117] 2 and 1/2 to go.
[ct=4397.453] Empty backfield.
[ct=4398.283] Go four by one.
[ct=4399.622] Four receivers up at the top.
[ct=4401.702] And you've got a flag here.
[ct=4408.612] Delay of game, offense.
[ct=4411.285] 5-yard penalty.
[ct=4412.892] First down.
[ct=4413.982] A first and 15 now.
[ct=4416.603] Andy Reid, a beautiful mind.
[ct=4417.907] A beautiful football mind.
[ct=4421.877] He's worked some magic through the years.
[ct=4424.586] I mean, last week, they came out in Arizona,
[ct=4426.053] he's running plays you've never seen before.
[ct=4428.568] Yeah, I mean, he obviously has that West Coast background.
[ct=4431.252] But he's so willing to change and adjust his scheme.
[ct=4436.520] Mahomes rolling against the grain.
[ct=4439.393] It's juggled and pulled in by Watson,
[ct=4443.167] who scored the touchdown to make it a 17-14 game.
[ct=4447.180] Usually when you see stacked receivers,
[ct=4448.460] you think the man behind has that cushion.
[ct=4452.500] But here, look at that throw again.
[ct=4453.871] Shortstop making a play.
[ct=4455.109] Ground ball over the pitcher.
[ct=4456.493] He goes over the shortstop, makes that throw, flips it.
[ct=4461.997] He'd have been a great baseball player.
[ct=4464.367] His father, of course, pitched for years.
[ct=4467.867] Many of those with the Twins.
[ct=4469.172] I think he and Herbert, their first love was baseball.
[ct=4471.833] It sounds like it, yeah.
[ct=4473.135] Used to be.
[ct=4473.961] Yeah, well, yeah.
[ct=4475.827] Until at least Pat signed his contract.
[ct=4481.107] Gets away.
[ct=4482.457] Throws.
[ct=4483.830] Finds the open man.
[ct=4485.110] You're talking about Kelce!
[ct=4487.801] And he gets down at the 2.
[ct=4489.963] Did the ball come out?
[ct=4490.422] Did the ball come out before the tackle?
[ct=4493.042] Meanwhile, it's in the end zone.
[ct=4495.755] And it's Bryce Callahan who comes up with the ball.
[ct=4498.549] So Kelce trying to work his way into the end zone.
[ct=4501.860] And they're going to call him down by contact.
[ct=4505.026] Well, Derwin James--
[ct=4506.365] --first down.
[ct=4506.584] --picked him up and body slammed him to the ground.
[ct=4510.013] And when his body hit the ground is when the ball popped up.
[ct=4513.326] So that's why they're going to call him down.
[ct=4515.663] He lifts him up-- that's a big man--
[ct=4517.438] throws him down.
[ct=4518.321] And now the Chiefs want to go tempo.
[ct=4519.646] They're at the line of scrimmage ready to go.
[ct=4522.566] They don't want to challenge.
[ct=4523.655] They don't want it to be looked at.
[ct=4524.936] [cheers, applause] He should be Friday night WWE.
[ct=4529.133] [laughs] That was a--
[ct=4531.654] he looked like he enjoyed doing that, Derwin James.
[ct=4535.605] Yes, he did.
[ct=4540.825] McKinnon.
[ct=4542.136] Can he get to the goal line?
[ct=4545.756] Second down and goal with a little over a minute
[ct=4548.749] to play in the third.
[ct=4551.424] Good push up in the middle there, Creed Humphrey.
[ct=4556.691] Linebackers coming down here.
[ct=4558.029] I mean, it's Derwin James picking up a big man
[ct=4561.565] and body-slamming him.
[ct=4563.252] Clearly he's down.
[ct=4564.601] The ground caused that fumble.
[ct=4571.223] Gives you an idea of the strength of number 3.
[ct=4575.223] Tremendous.
[ct=4576.545] Second and goal.
[ct=4583.202] Mahomes to the end zone.
[ct=4584.527] And broken up in the end zone by Asante Samuel.
[ct=4589.823] Had his eyes set on Jody Fortson, the tight end.
[ct=4593.418] Samuel breaks it up.
[ct=4593.785] Yeah, 6' 4" tight end who has wide receiver background.
[ct=4596.483] But if you're going to go with this match-up because
[ct=4599.095] of the size, surprised he didn't put it up into the air.
[ct=4603.004] He threw that on a line.
[ct=4604.273] And the quickness of Samuel gave him a chance
[ct=4607.009] to jump on that football.
[ct=4608.305] You get a guy isolated against a smaller corner,
[ct=4609.799] you've got to put it a little bit more touch up in the air
[ct=4616.281] A little shovel pass.
[ct=4617.588] And it's complete but not to the goal line.
[ct=4622.671] That's Kelce.
[ct=4623.937] They got a shovel pass touchdown last week to Edwards-Helaire.
[ct=4627.805] So now do you take the automatic tie?
[ct=4630.475] Or do you go for the touchdown here?
[ct=4634.492] Booyah.
[ct=4635.788] They have the whole intermission to think about it
[ct=4637.102] because that will be the end of the third quarter.
[ct=4642.195] Good going at least for the moment.
[ct=4645.071] Ammendola is in to try to tie the game.
[ct=4647.748] Big discussion there.
[ct=4649.042] But they elect to go to tie it up.
[ct=4653.085] So the newly acquired rental kicker sends that one right
[ct=4658.379] down the middle.
[ct=4659.718] And we are tied up.
[ct=4661.196] The kick is bouncing through the end zone.
[ct=4666.078] And then it'll fly to Kyle Field--
[ct=4667.833] There you go.
[ct=4668.964] --after the game.
[ct=4669.866] What a weekend.
[ct=4670.079] Oop, we've got a late flag here.
[ct=4673.825] We got a flag down.
[ct=4673.931] Meanwhile, coaches 100 games over .500, Shula, Halas,
[ct=4678.765] they finished over .500.
[ct=4680.206] Belichick way over now.
[ct=4682.056] Landry and Lambeau were over but finished under 100 over .500,
[ct=4688.005] if you know what I mean.
[ct=4688.940] I'm sure you do.
[ct=4690.581] After the play was over, personal foul,
[ct=4693.407] number 6 of the kicking team.
[ct=4695.909] That 15-yard penalty will be enforced from the 25-yard line.
[ct=4701.913] The rookie out of Cincinnati loses his cool here.
[ct=4706.033] Bryan Cook.
[ct=4706.509] Yeah, this is what you've got to learn
[ct=4710.076] is, hopefully come into the League already, knowing it's 57.
[ct=4714.184] Boom!
[ct=4714.708] A little push there.
[ct=4716.072] It wasn't malicious, but it was well
[ct=4717.369] after the whistle and an easy call.
[ct=4718.858] And Chargers will say thank you very much.
[ct=4721.386] They'll start at the 40 after that.
[ct=4723.998] Second round pick who was known as a hard-hitter in college,
[ct=4727.975] but do it before the whistle sounds.
[ct=4734.596] So the Chargers now from the 40-yard line.
[ct=4741.276] You've got Storm Norton coming into the game at right tackle.
[ct=4745.291] They're shifting around on that offensive front.
[ct=4747.968] And they start with the play fake.
[ct=4750.065] Herbert has to dance away under pressure.
[ct=4753.051] Throws to Ekeler.
[ct=4755.416] Escapes the tackle behind the line of scrimmage.
[ct=4758.159] Turns it into a short gain.
[ct=4762.090] Here's Karlaftis, the rookie out of Purdue.
[ct=4764.687] He just throws Ekeler away.
[ct=4765.833] And then he's trying to get pressure.
[ct=4767.367] One thing you think of Mahomes and his athletic ability,
[ct=4771.136] but Justin Herbert, at 6' 6", he doesn't just sit in the pocket.
[ct=4775.051] He's dangerous and can get outside
[ct=4776.282] if you don't keep the edge of the defense.
[ct=4787.880] Sees this pressure right here from Sneed.
[ct=4793.841] Sneed backs off.
[ct=4797.162] A little flip out to Ekeler.
[ct=4799.858] Dances his way.
[ct=4801.189] And he gets hogtied.
[ct=4802.439] Close to a first down, short--
[ct=4805.131] So shifting around up front.
[ct=4805.866] Meanwhile, on a third and short, they move the chains here
[ct=4810.012] on an Ekeler 3 or 4-yard pickup.
[ct=4813.090] Good push there on the left side, the offensive line.
[ct=4817.195] Mike Danna kind of took himself out of the play.
[ct=4819.742] And then you had a double team inside and just
[ct=4822.028] opened that up there on third and short.
[ct=4825.020] It's a big drive here for the Chargers.
[ct=4827.557] Trying to locate that rhythm that Joe Lombardi had earlier.
[ct=4831.584] Remember, we just mentioned, they went two straight three
[ct=4833.908] and outs with poor field position.
[ct=4835.556] Now much better here starting at their own 40.
[ct=4839.608] What will the grandson of Vince send in here?
[ct=4844.741] Swings it to the outside.
[ct=4845.698] Joshua Palmer makes the catch and slips out
[ct=4848.815] of bounds after a short gain.
[ct=4850.041] Now Herbert's trying to take a page out of Patrick Mahomes.
[ct=4853.880] Steve Spagnuolo sitting back in coverage.
[ct=4856.584] Forcing him to go underneath.
[ct=4857.857] No more Mike Williams shots is what Spags is saying.
[ct=4860.558] I don't want to see that ball thrown downfield.
[ct=4863.186] Make him throw underneath.
[ct=4864.544] Let's rally to the ball.
[ct=4872.502] Herbert 20 of 29, 197.
[ct=4886.995] Flip it out to the motion man, Carter.
[ct=4889.656] Tightropes the sideline and stays inbounds long enough
[ct=4894.980] to pick up the first down.
[ct=4896.287] Nice move.
[ct=4896.506] He motions Carter.
[ct=4897.832] Nobody responds.
[ct=4898.949] Nobody runs with him.
[ct=4900.278] So if they would have run with him,
[ct=4901.651] it would have been man-to-man.
[ct=4902.963] He would have handed that ball off.
[ct=4904.233] Nobody runs with him, so he aborts that run,
[ct=4908.226] flips it outside to Carter where he's
[ct=4909.232] got two-on-two for blocking.
[ct=4911.006] And it allows Carter to pick up a first down.
[ct=4913.586] Well designed play there.
[ct=4914.891] And it gave the quarterback Herbert
[ct=4916.266] the option of the handoff or the throw.
[ct=4920.191] Read it perfectly.
[ct=4926.852] Herbert, progressions.
[ct=4929.075] Caught at the 31-yard line.
[ct=4932.157] Gerald Everett.
[ct=4934.899] Tackled there by Fenton.
[ct=4936.139] Everett with the Rams when Staley was there.
[ct=4938.822] Went to Seattle for one year.
[ct=4940.146] And now he's back with Staley.
[ct=4941.615] Herbert, again, just kind of working through those
[ct=4944.149] progressions, showing his patience.
[ct=4946.825] He wants to go to the right.
[ct=4948.054] Comes off one, comes off two.
[ct=4949.408] Steps up and eventually finds that third option.
[ct=4953.292] And he works through his progressions
[ct=4954.807] as fast as anybody in the NFL and throws with accuracy.
[ct=4971.880] On a roll.
[ct=4973.218] Open.
[ct=4974.533] And Everett barrels his way inside the 5
[ct=4978.508] to set up a first down and goal.
[ct=4983.824] Well, how about this.
[ct=4985.116] You go play action.
[ct=4985.727] The linebackers are completely lost on this.
[ct=4989.852] Gives the ball out to Everett.
[ct=4991.603] Nobody's there to slow him down.
[ct=4993.898] Picks up that momentum.
[ct=4994.452] Big guy to bring down.
[ct=4996.904] Again, quick tempo.
[ct=4998.210] And picked off at the 1-yard line!
[ct=5001.831] That is Watson out in front.
[ct=5005.752] Sneed to protect him as well.
[ct=5007.497] All the way for the touchdown.
[ct=5013.730] Unreal!
[ct=5020.762] Wow!
[ct=5021.271] What a play here.
[ct=5022.062] Watch what happens when you use outside leverage.
[ct=5026.058] He sits to the outside.
[ct=5028.467] And that's what Herbert sees.
[ct=5029.880] It's a top of the route.
[ct=5031.097] He thinks he's got a chance to throw to the inside.
[ct=5035.006] And instead of being able to put it there, it's jumped.
[ct=5039.001] Great job by a rookie in Watson to step in front of that
[ct=5042.975] throw where Herbert thought he had the leverage
[ct=5045.295] to work it back to the inside.
[ct=5046.949] Not only a rookie, a seventh round draft
[ct=5049.303] choice because of the injury to McDuffie in the backfield.
[ct=5054.927] One of the reasons he's probably active for tonight's game.
[ct=5058.928] Ammendola.
[ct=5063.133] 99 yards.
[ct=5064.479] 24-17.
[ct=5069.346] What is your career highlight, Jaylen?
[ct=5072.437] [laughs] No doubt about it.
[ct=5081.208] He gets a touchdown.
[ct=5082.960] Offensively, their touchdown was scored by Justin Watson.
[ct=5086.955] No relation.
[ct=5087.087] Sherlock Holmes must be in the neighborhood tonight.
[ct=5089.868] No doubt.
[ct=5090.853] [chuckles] Yet another Watson touchdown.
[ct=5095.900] So the Chargers get it back.
[ct=5097.268] The Chiefs have scored 17 unanswered points.
[ct=5105.218] He's tired.
[ct=5105.292] He's gassed.
[ct=5105.965] They're going tempo.
[ct=5107.841] You can see he wants out of the game.
[ct=5109.200] He's like, all right, he's going to stay in.
[ct=5111.858] And he ends up becoming a pivotal part of this
[ct=5113.895] because he's lined up.
[ct=5114.868] He's walking to the flat.
[ct=5115.785] There's 35 right there, kind of baiting Herbert.
[ct=5118.599] Watson, I'm outside, I'm outside.
[ct=5121.062] Jumps to the inside.
[ct=5122.188] You might say whose fault is that?
[ct=5123.774] Is it Everett?
[ct=5125.078] Is it Herbert?
[ct=5126.103] It's a miscommunication.
[ct=5127.729] Quarterback thought that he would
[ct=5129.069] work back inside with outside leverage
[ct=5130.606] from the defensive back.
[ct=5131.706] And he ended up moving the wrong direction.
[ct=5133.944] That's why they're talking on the sideline
[ct=5136.975] to get on the same page.
[ct=5138.054] And 99 yards.
[ct=5138.516] As [inaudible] said 99 and 1/2.
[ct=5143.720] Herbert, backs up.
[ct=5146.093] Short gain here.
[ct=5148.070] Caught by Austin Ekeler.
[ct=5148.899] Tackled there by Willie Gay with a little over 10
[ct=5152.815] to play in regulation.
[ct=5153.815] You look at all the quarterbacks in the NFL.
[ct=5156.813] Everybody talks about Josh Allen, and they should.
[ct=5159.440] Talk about Mahomes.
[ct=5160.791] You talk about Joe Burrow.
[ct=5161.797] You talk about Lamar Jackson.
[ct=5163.453] And you talk about Justin Herbert.
[ct=5165.388] They played great tonight.
[ct=5167.386] That pick six costly.
[ct=5169.023] 10 minutes to go.
[ct=5169.766] You want to be in that conversation as a quarterback?
[ct=5172.646] This is where you've got to show that on the road.
[ct=5183.073] Keep it on the ground again.
[ct=5184.358] Fighting his way to create a third and short.
[ct=5188.314] Ekeler tackled by Darius Harris.
[ct=5191.048] Remember, they just had a heck of a drive
[ct=5193.678] starting at their own 40.
[ct=5195.059] Mixed up the pass.
[ct=5196.333] Brandon Staley has got to be happy with the way Herbert
[ct=5200.316] and Lombardi are working in sync.
[ct=5201.309] Got to convert on this third down.
[ct=5208.295] They are 4 of 11 on third down tonight.
[ct=5221.733] 4 of 12 now.
[ct=5224.150] Chris Jones, the foodie, who snacks at McDonald's.
[ct=5232.071] Well, they walk up Willie Gay to create that one-on-one match-up.
[ct=5235.965] You see Gay just to the left of Jones.
[ct=5238.118] We've said he's had a quiet night.
[ct=5239.934] Well, he gets off the ball so suddenly.
[ct=5242.645] He just overpowers Feiler, the left guard.
[ct=5246.077] Nothing he can do.
[ct=5246.227] By the time he came out of his stance, 95 reminding everybody
[ct=5250.558] how dominant he is in this defense.
[ct=5253.216] Having a quiet night until the fourth quarter.
[ct=5257.270] All that healthy eating lets him take over in the fourth quarter.
[ct=5261.165] No question.
[ct=5261.750] Stamina, baby.
[ct=5263.846] And now you've got a flag before the snap.
[ct=5272.999] Illegal snap infraction, offense, number 47.
[ct=5279.700] Fourth down.
[ct=5281.011] That's Josh Harris, illegal snap infraction.
[ct=5283.680] Yeah, I think he just moved right before the snap.
[ct=5285.730] And he's one of the top long snappers in the League.
[ct=5291.658] They were able to pick him up.
[ct=5292.973] But cost them 5 more yards.
[ct=5294.600] [crowd singing]
[ct=5299.598] Scott.
[ct=5300.997] Angled toward the near side.
[ct=5303.165] Flag is thrown.
[ct=5304.527] Caught at the 30.
[ct=5306.954] And Skyy Moore to the 35.
[ct=5312.329] Get the call here from John Hussey.
[ct=5328.176] There it is right there.
[ct=5333.498] Has to get back in.
[ct=5334.874] That's Ja'Sir Taylor.
[ct=5338.570] During the kick, personal foul, receiving team, number 6.
[ct=5343.925] Blocking a member of the kicking team out of bounds.
[ct=5347.883] That 15-yard penalty will be enforced from the end
[ct=5350.079] of the kick.
[ct=5353.230] Timeout.
[ct=5353.978] Well, that's on Bryan Cook, who's
[ct=5354.676] having a night to forget as the second round draft choice.
[ct=5358.199] Gets two 15-yard penalties.
[ct=5360.847] 24-17, Kansas City.
[ct=5363.474] Meanwhile, KC has it at the 15-yard line to start this
[ct=5368.771] drive.
[ct=5369.592] Trying to hold on to the lead.
[ct=5372.498] Take a little clock with it as well, if they can.
[ct=5375.146] Edwards-Helaire for a gain of about 4.
[ct=5377.331] Patrick Mahomes has had to really earn it tonight.
[ct=5381.521] Like we saw last year, he's done it in a lot of different areas.
[ct=5385.425] He's moving the launch angle because of that pressure.
[ct=5388.696] There's the infamous Mahomes sidearm on the run.
[ct=5392.621] Doing such a good job here, especially late
[ct=5395.251] being able to find some playmakers.
[ct=5396.586] Justin Watson made a big play for him.
[ct=5399.229] Kelce made a big play for him.
[ct=5405.519] Halfway through the fourth quarter.
[ct=5408.308] Second down and 7.
[ct=5409.620] Little dump off.
[ct=5411.006] Edwards-Helaire, room to roam.
[ct=5412.275] First down and about 6 more yards.
[ct=5416.314] Tackled by Derwin James.
[ct=5420.250] And one way to slow down Bosa is to throw a screen on his side.
[ct=5425.594] Let him get upfield and see if you can get a convoy behind him.
[ct=5428.414] Nobody really necessarily picks up the block.
[ct=5430.923] But there's Bosa.
[ct=5432.191] Wily little spin move.
[ct=5433.935] Bait him in and then flip it out there to Edwards-Helaire.
[ct=5438.765] And a lot of room for him to work behind Bosa.
[ct=5449.417] On the ground to McKinnon again.
[ct=5456.092] Not seeing the Chiefs out there a lot tonight offensively.
[ct=5460.037] You think of the firepower.
[ct=5461.162] You think of Mahomes.
[ct=5462.697] Andy Reid has, again, had to be patient.
[ct=5465.043] They've have the pick six.
[ct=5465.424] But only 45 plays with 6 and 1/2 minutes to go in the game.
[ct=5472.003] Being patient right now, too.
[ct=5473.033] I mean, there's a long way to go, obviously.
[ct=5476.003] But run that clock down.
[ct=5478.516] No rush.
[ct=5479.895] Keep the clock moving.
[ct=5485.165] Which he does with great proficiency as always.
[ct=5490.676] Takes the play clock all the way to 2.
[ct=5493.358] Second down and 6.
[ct=5495.794] And that time, it's Kyle Van Noy close to a pick.
[ct=5499.820] Third down and 6.
[ct=5501.088] You could hear the cadence from Mahomes
[ct=5503.692] talking about alert and alert and making some adjustments.
[ct=5506.298] He's thinking potential pressure.
[ct=5508.979] And he's starting to think about I've got to get the ball out.
[ct=5511.637] James is coming from my left, and they don't.
[ct=5513.671] So they disguise it.
[ct=5514.585] He's thinking about a crosser might be open.
[ct=5517.145] And it almost backfires on him.
[ct=5520.806] They show pressure.
[ct=5521.712] They bail.
[ct=5521.862] And he puts it right into the coverage.
[ct=5524.809] Exactly what Brandon Staley wanted.
[ct=5527.456] Van Noy almost comes up with a pick.
[ct=5528.930] Also getting a little bit of the jersey.
[ct=5535.442] Chargers put the pressure on.
[ct=5536.975] Pass is incomplete and overthrown on that one.
[ct=5540.866] You got Valdes-Scantling covered by Asante Samuel.
[ct=5544.860] So exactly what the Chargers needed.
[ct=5547.492] Get him off the field.
[ct=5548.880] Tell you, Asante Samuel is having a night.
[ct=5550.183] They are not getting behind him.
[ct=5552.847] He is playing with poise.
[ct=5554.184] Instincts are on fire tonight.
[ct=5556.798] Getting his eyes turned.
[ct=5558.256] Locating the football.
[ct=5561.753] Heck of a night for 26.
[ct=5563.462] Almost had that pick, which, that would have been gigantic.
[ct=5567.620] Tommy Townsend, sixth punt of the night.
[ct=5573.787] Carter calls for the fair catch.
[ct=5576.749] And the Chargers get the ball at the 15-yard line.
[ct=5580.627] We've been talking a lot.
[ct=5580.946] Big expectations for Chris Jones this year just playing inside.
[ct=5585.553] Had a quiet first half.
[ct=5587.139] But starting to move around.
[ct=5588.501] Was on the offensive line's right side against the rookie.
[ct=5591.168] Johnson is working now to the left.
[ct=5593.525] Spagnuolo doing a good job of moving him around.
[ct=5596.492] He's so effective not only against the run,
[ct=5597.759] but as we see, also against the pass.
[ct=5600.495] You've got to believe late in the game,
[ct=5602.535] just under 6:00 minutes to go, keep an eye on the interior
[ct=5605.428] of the Chiefs, especially when Herbert's back there throwing.
[ct=5611.059] He's a disruptor.
[ct=5613.129] Picked in the second round back in 2016 out
[ct=5617.125] of Mississippi State.
[ct=5622.963] Herbert surveys.
[ct=5624.510] Checks it off.
[ct=5625.106] And Ekeler drops it.
[ct=5626.859] Took his eyes off and looked downfield.
[ct=5630.715] A little changeup here from Steve Spagnuolo.
[ct=5634.650] He always does such a good job of being multiple.
[ct=5637.272] That time showed a little bit of pressure,
[ct=5638.902] but instead, he just rushes three.
[ct=5641.230] Drops eight into coverage.
[ct=5643.900] Even if he catches that ball, there's
[ct=5645.259] two defenders waiting on Ekeler.
[ct=5655.814] Williams wide left with Fenton on him.
[ct=5658.815] Pass over the middle into a tight window, as the saying
[ct=5663.274] goes.
[ct=5663.491] And that's Everett making the grab.
[ct=5664.688] And that sets up a third down and short.
[ct=5669.667] So what do Staley and Lombardi do here?
[ct=5673.625] Third down and 2.
[ct=5673.950] What's the call?
[ct=5675.578] Oh, please.
[ct=5683.259] Herbert, look out.
[ct=5683.472] Fires and that's caught.
[ct=5685.554] And once again, it's Everett.
[ct=5687.294] So under pressure darting, and dancing, and stepping up
[ct=5689.954] in the pocket and down he goes.
[ct=5691.292] And Herbert needs some help in getting up.
[ct=5695.199] Holding his rib cage.
[ct=5696.649] And uh-oh.
[ct=5697.896] Mike Danna hit him as he released the ball.
[ct=5702.085] Put his shoulder pads right into his chest
[ct=5705.580] and then came down on him.
[ct=5707.156] Does a good job, as he always does, working the progressions.
[ct=5710.002] But here you see, wrapped up right as he releases it.
[ct=5714.924] And he comes down.
[ct=5716.248] So every Charger fan holds their breath.
[ct=5717.772] The backup quarterback is the well-traveled and 13-year
[ct=5722.909] veteran Chase Daniel.
[ct=5724.999] Clean hit by Danna.
[ct=5728.590] So they work on Herbert, as Daniel warms up.
[ct=5736.164] That's him walking off.
[ct=5738.901] He goes to the bench.
[ct=5739.093] Right now he is standing on the sideline,
[ct=5741.195] helmet on, and appears to be ready to come in after one play.
[ct=5745.336] But he has to sit out for at least one play.
[ct=5746.819] Chase Daniel is the backup quarterback.
[ct=5750.765] Played his college ball at Missouri.
[ct=5753.384] Been in the League 13 seasons.
[ct=5754.537] This is his seventh team.
[ct=5755.948] So at least for one play, Daniel comes in.
[ct=5759.947] Sony Michel is the back.
[ct=5762.316] And they give it to Michel on a first down.
[ct=5763.911] And he gets hogtied at the 39-yard line.
[ct=5767.895] And now Herbert is going to come back into the game.
[ct=5771.664] Go to a veteran quarterback.
[ct=5772.976] Gets under center.
[ct=5774.096] Simple handoff.
[ct=5775.627] And now you get your guy back into the lineup.
[ct=5779.588] And they pick up some positive yards.
[ct=5782.003] I mean, second and 6.
[ct=5784.916] You talk about a heart-in-your-throat moment
[ct=5787.909] for anybody in the Charger organization.
[ct=5791.579] Of course, I did a game once when
[ct=5792.911] they carted Aaron Rodgers off the field and he came back
[ct=5795.523] and he won the game after being down by 20.
[ct=5798.115] Never know.
[ct=5799.483] High drama.
[ct=5803.504] Herbert to the-- oh!
[ct=5804.825] And that one is deflected off the hands.
[ct=5807.505] And again, Herbert goes down.
[ct=5809.003] Takes another shot this time from Frank Clark.
[ct=5812.699] Helped up by Slater.
[ct=5813.767] It's going to be third down and 6.
[ct=5816.705] Again, another clean hit.
[ct=5817.737] Clark coming from our right.
[ct=5819.331] Hits him as he releases that ball.
[ct=5821.712] Actually makes that throw-- how often do you
[ct=5824.659] It's because of the pressure he felt.
[ct=5827.307] And the Chiefs almost come away with an interception.
[ct=5829.575] Well, Herbert's going to stay in.
[ct=5832.772] Obviously in pain.
[ct=5835.329] He slid off to the side of the huddle for a minute.
[ct=5836.701] And you've got a big third and 6 with 4:00 minutes to play.
[ct=5841.968] Can he convert?
[ct=5844.625] And he's lucky it wasn't picked by Bolton.
[ct=5848.648] So he goes to the bench.
[ct=5849.557] Fourth down and 6 and they have to punt.
[ct=5853.569] And I circle Mike Williams because you've
[ct=5855.294] got to think he's going to get the ball.
[ct=5856.828] And I think the Chiefs and everybody watching,
[ct=5859.222] everybody in the stadium thought he's going to get the ball.
[ct=5861.669] Look at this, he predetermines where to go with the ball.
[ct=5865.707] I know he can throw it into tight windows.
[ct=5868.304] That is tight coverage.
[ct=5870.910] He's had such success with Williams tonight.
[ct=5873.593] And I don't think he reads this one.
[ct=5878.890] Sky-high punt.
[ct=5881.118] Caught at the 9-yard line by Skyy Moore.
[ct=5885.885] So the Chargers have all of their timeouts.
[ct=5889.762] You also have the 2-minute warning.
[ct=5892.523] And you have 3:55 on the clock.
[ct=5893.885] Next week we go to Cleveland.
[ct=5897.963] --nasty.
[ct=5899.249] Be good.
[ct=5899.491] Two-hour drive between the cities.
[ct=5902.079] Chiefs now on first down.
[ct=5904.326] Protecting the ball and getting out in front Edwards-Helaire!
[ct=5908.317] But there's a flag down.
[ct=5909.379] A flag is down.
[ct=5910.977] And so is Helaire.
[ct=5913.263] I thought they--
[ct=5913.557] Both arms around the ball but a penalty flag.
[ct=5917.307] I thought they grabbed--
[ct=5918.206] --21-yard line.
[ct=5918.459] Looked like they may have grabbed his face mask.
[ct=5922.897] But you're right, he was not going
[ct=5929.259] Personal foul, face mask, defense, number 13.
[ct=5933.350] That penalty will be added to the end of the run.
[ct=5939.851] This is a unique face mask with a shield.
[ct=5941.400] It's hard to get a hold of that one.
[ct=5945.249] But a really good job late in the game.
[ct=5947.925] Trey Smith there, 65.
[ct=5949.250] He gets to that second level.
[ct=5950.353] I'm telling you, he is a physical runner.
[ct=5953.270] There's a hand there by Derwin James.
[ct=5956.897] The left hand gets locked up.
[ct=5959.514] But boy, just like that, they're all the way inside the 20-yard
[ct=5963.708] line.
[ct=5964.927] Well, he had a 52-yard run.
[ct=5967.865] 7-point game.
[ct=5970.022] 3:45.
[ct=5972.896] Ball down to the 18-yard line now.
[ct=5991.819] Time to chew up some clock here for the Chiefs.
[ct=5994.664] Andy Reid and Patrick Mahomes absolutely now no hurry.
[ct=5999.775] Very least you want to force the Chargers
[ct=6001.959] to use all their timeouts here.
[ct=6004.805] There's the first.
[ct=6005.911] --the road.
[ct=6006.178] But every team in the division but the winner of this game
[ct=6008.788] is going to have a loss.
[ct=6011.466] Second down and 9 from the 17.
[ct=6016.735] Pressure.
[ct=6017.763] And the pass is incomplete.
[ct=6019.571] The crowd wants a flag.
[ct=6022.465] None available.
[ct=6024.610] Adderley covering Valdes-Scantling.
[ct=6027.265] It'll be third down and 9.
[ct=6028.575] At the top of the route, I think that's
[ct=6031.150] what Mahomes, and this crowd, and even
[ct=6034.146] Andy Reid is looking at.
[ct=6036.293] [crowd booing]
[ct=6037.228] Adderley off to the left on the inside.
[ct=6038.980] Once he breaks to the outside, 24 gets a hold of him.
[ct=6042.971] At the end, he puts his hands up.
[ct=6044.259] But I think he may have gotten away with one there.
[ct=6049.735] Small break for the Chargers that stops the clock.
[ct=6053.365] Don't have to use another timeout.
[ct=6055.129] Third down and 9.
[ct=6068.028] A dart caught at the 14.
[ct=6070.689] Now the field goal team will come in
[ct=6072.023] to try to make this a two-possession game.
[ct=6074.669] Catch made by JuJu Smith-Schuster.
[ct=6077.164] And Staley will use his second timeout.
[ct=6078.693] And there's been three real big plays in this game.
[ct=6082.626] We talked about how the Chargers had moved the ball all the way
[ct=6086.344] down to the 3-yard line.
[ct=6086.377] And then this throw with the miscommunication and the pick
[ct=6090.440] six.
[ct=6090.580] And then we started to see Chris Jones make himself felt.
[ct=6094.314] Last time they had the ball, just
[ct=6095.912] forcing it in to Mike Williams hoping
[ct=6098.371] that he could come up with it.
[ct=6099.917] And the ball really didn't have much of a chance,
[ct=6102.314] throwing it into coverage.
[ct=6105.093] Matt Ammendola to try to make this a 10-point game.
[ct=6108.987] He's been good tonight.
[ct=6110.305] With the Jets last year, not very good.
[ct=6113.068] Got released.
[ct=6114.142] Was out on the street last week.
[ct=6116.972] Saw him in preseason with the Texans
[ct=6120.927] when Fairbairn was injured.
[ct=6123.564] And now trying to, as a rental kicker,
[ct=6126.358] give them a 10-point lead.
[ct=6131.418] 32-yard attempt.
[ct=6133.869] Bangs it through.
[ct=6135.436] Welcome to Kansas City.
[ct=6136.784] Yeah!
[ct=6137.929] New hero.
[ct=6142.382] So it's 27-17.
[ct=6146.158] And 20 straight points now for Kansas City,
[ct=6148.531] as Herbert is still on the mend.
[ct=6150.083] And he's talking to the backup, Chase Daniel,
[ct=6152.517] just kind of pointing to where maybe he's
[ct=6155.164] feeling some of that pain.
[ct=6159.296] He's going to warm up.
[ct=6160.564] Give it a go again.
[ct=6163.126] 3:20.
[ct=6165.550] He doesn't look comfortable.
[ct=6167.114] No, not at all.
[ct=6168.502] No, he does not look comfortable.
[ct=6175.079] The good news for Herbert is at least
[ct=6177.922] he's got an extra half a week to get ready for week 3 because
[ct=6183.179] of the Thursday Night game.
[ct=6184.344] Meanwhile, you've got the run back here up to the 27-yard line
[ct=6188.386] by DeAndre Carter with 3:16 on the clock.
[ct=6191.048] Even look at him just jogging onto the field, right?
[ct=6193.776] He definitely is fighting through some pain here.
[ct=6196.404] He's got the one timeout, the 2-minute warning.
[ct=6199.146] And they've already gone a lot of tempo tonight.
[ct=6201.762] But they're really going to have to crank it up
[ct=6205.036] They've got to get points on the board and get the ball back.
[ct=6210.457] And now you've got a defense that's
[ct=6211.873] going to be coming after him.
[ct=6226.203] Ekeler.
[ct=6227.838] A little bit of room.
[ct=6229.131] And a lot of good moves there to take it out close to midfield.
[ct=6234.258] Such a great part of this offense.
[ct=6237.120] It's not just the passing game with the receivers.
[ct=6239.754] It's the tight ends.
[ct=6241.062] It's Ekeler out of the backfield.
[ct=6242.522] He makes something that looked like a 3-yard gain into a huge
[ct=6246.346] play.
[ct=6246.793] Under 3:00 now to go.
[ct=6250.330] Again, it's Ekeler underneath.
[ct=6258.293] Second and 4.
[ct=6258.866] Steve Spagnuolo, the defensive coordinator
[ct=6264.601] Nothing cheap.
[ct=6264.830] They want to throw underneath to Ekeler.
[ct=6266.178] We're going to give that up and rally to that football.
[ct=6270.118] Just nothing can get behind us with Mike Williams, 81.
[ct=6277.839] Williams huge first half.
[ct=6280.545] Only 2 catches in the second half.
[ct=6288.007] Herbert again to the outside.
[ct=6291.624] And that'll be a little short of the first down.
[ct=6294.244] Sneed is right there tackling Joshua Kelley.
[ct=6296.895] It'll be third down and 2.
[ct=6298.237] Not only do you not pick up the first down,
[ct=6300.884] but you don't get the ball out of bounds.
[ct=6303.515] The clock keeps moving.
[ct=6308.869] You've got two plays here, obviously, to pick up the first.
[ct=6311.509] Third and a long 1 they call it now.
[ct=6321.921] Pump fake.
[ct=6323.544] You can tell that he's in such pain
[ct=6325.924] right there he can barely get rid of it.
[ct=6329.075] That was very, very strange to see Herbert,
[ct=6334.383] who could have walked another couple yards
[ct=6338.007] and picked up a first down.
[ct=6339.196] Gives you an idea.
[ct=6340.536] Yeah, he can't even throw it.
[ct=6341.870] I mean, he's in pain.
[ct=6345.514] Yeah, he could have run, and slid, and picked up
[ct=6348.756] the first down, right?
[ct=6351.175] Of course.
[ct=6352.781] Trying to gut it out.
[ct=6367.534] Can he keep it alive?
[ct=6369.779] Fires it.
[ct=6371.267] Caught inside the 10-yard line by DeAndre Carter!
[ct=6375.269] So there is Herbert again with that fourth down magic.
[ct=6379.256] And that's going to take us to the 2-minute warning with 1:58.
[ct=6383.490] Well, this is what makes Herbert one of the elite quarterbacks,
[ct=6389.820] is he just decided not to run on third down.
[ct=6393.591] And he comes back with an absolute dart on fourth down.
[ct=6399.186] Could not have handled the ball any better
[ct=6403.172] to Carter on that throw.
[ct=6405.839] That was tight coverage.
[ct=6407.169] Oh, it's amazing.
[ct=6408.536] Because the play before that, he can't run.
[ct=6410.062] He can't throw either.
[ct=6411.171] I mean, it was an awkward pass.
[ct=6412.503] And then he goes back and he throws a dart down the middle
[ct=6417.343] to keep them in the game.
[ct=6418.507] It's like a boxer on the ropes late in a fight.
[ct=6426.445] These are some of the hits he's taken in this second half alone.
[ct=6428.756] You can see his face.
[ct=6430.132] I mean, he's uncomfortable.
[ct=6431.962] I think it's not one hit.
[ct=6434.386] It's been a combination of three or four different hits.
[ct=6439.926] But to be able to withstand that, and stand
[ct=6442.421] in there with pressure, and make that throw
[ct=6444.838] tells you everything you need to know about this kid's heart.
[ct=6449.197] It's like out of a movie, or at least a made-for-TV one anyway.
[ct=6457.304] 1:58.
[ct=6460.036] Chargers have one timeout.
[ct=6464.215] Ekeler tries to stay in, but he does.
[ct=6467.902] In a way, you want to get out of bounds.
[ct=6470.471] But then, again, he was trying to pick up extra yardage.
[ct=6473.209] He's tackled there by Willie Gay.
[ct=6474.381] Clock keeps moving.
[ct=6477.288] Chargers 3 for 3 on fourth down tonight.
[ct=6480.171] Right now second down and goal.
[ct=6484.287] Herbert fires.
[ct=6485.234] Too high.
[ct=6486.684] Incomplete.
[ct=6486.768] Intended for Palmer.
[ct=6489.195] I don't understand why the clock didn't stop.
[ct=6494.454] I mean, he got thrown out of bounds.
[ct=6498.394] The official came in.
[ct=6500.006] He ruled him inside.
[ct=6501.552] Yeah, look at this.
[ct=6504.024] Here's Gay.
[ct=6505.600] I mean, [inaudible]?
[ct=6508.008] You tell me.
[ct=6510.613] Terry, quickly, what do you think?
[ct=6512.155] Al, he ruled forward progress.
[ct=6514.394] It's not.
[ct=6515.728] It didn't look like it to me.
[ct=6517.097] It should have been a stopped clock.
[ct=6519.751] Third and goal.
[ct=6522.152] Herbert.
[ct=6523.672] Does he have more magic?
[ct=6525.054] Not on that play.
[ct=6526.224] Ekeler taken down by Gay.
[ct=6528.979] And here we go again.
[ct=6532.927] Clock will roll.
[ct=6534.128] Fourth and goal.
[ct=6534.429] Here we go.
[ct=6540.090] More magic on fourth down.
[ct=6543.603] Yes!
[ct=6545.289] Joshua Palmer.
[ct=6547.592] [chuckles] Herbert is unbelievable.
[ct=6551.566] Unbelievable!
[ct=6552.913] So poised.
[ct=6554.036] Just will not go away.
[ct=6556.652] Remember, he tried to force one in earlier.
[ct=6558.898] Tried to get the ball into Mike Williams.
[ct=6561.283] This time don't even think about it.
[ct=6562.502] Just kind of works back to the back side to Palmer.
[ct=6566.364] Looks left, comes back, and then finds that nice opening
[ct=6569.575] in the back of that defense.
[ct=6571.932] Palmer.
[ct=6573.232] Look at his eyes creeping back.
[ct=6574.357] I think he knew all along he could get it to him.
[ct=6577.262] Never seen a crowd go from 147 decibels to 3.
[ct=6588.625] So now it's 27 to 24.
[ct=6589.843] You're compelled to try an onside kick here.
[ct=6594.056] Well, you have to.
[ct=6595.139] Only the one timeout.
[ct=6599.083] Come down to that.
[ct=6600.469] --a very big man.
[ct=6603.072] Keep telling him you may get a call.
[ct=6605.652] You may get a call.
[ct=6607.058] He told me his phone is off the hook.
[ct=6609.466] He didn't really say that.
[ct=6612.396] I think all those guys and girls are enjoying the TV.
[ct=6615.182] Absolutely.
[ct=6617.373] So now you've got an onside kick here.
[ct=6620.171] Of course, the Chiefs anticipating it.
[ct=6624.191] Only have one guy back in case it's a bouncing ball down
[ct=6628.253] the middle of the field.
[ct=6629.045] And Hopkins, who was with Washington last year.
[ct=6633.044] Chargers, with these, as I mentioned before
[ct=6636.213] and several times through the years,
[ct=6637.635] gigantic kicking woes over the last decade.
[ct=6640.908] Can he execute the onside and keep them in the game?
[ct=6650.824] Success rate 17% in the League last year.
[ct=6654.770] A little bouncing ball.
[ct=6656.113] And it's loose!
[ct=6656.890] And a pileup for it.
[ct=6658.778] Who's got it on the bottom of it?
[ct=6660.876] Who's at the bottom.
[ct=6663.975] Kansas City.
[ct=6666.772] Looked like Noah Gray might have gotten underneath there.
[ct=6671.966] He wants to make sure.
[ct=6673.262] He says, listen, here it is.
[ct=6674.590] --reset the game clock--
[ct=6675.947] Here's the evidence.
[ct=6677.241] --1:09, please.
[ct=6678.562] 1:09.
[ct=6679.987] If you're a Chargers fan, you're thinking, ooh, baby.
[ct=6682.857] It's loose!
[ct=6685.248] Great job by Gray.
[ct=6686.552] That ball was out there.
[ct=6689.241] What an effort tonight by Herbert, right?
[ct=6691.878] Again, and another excruciating defeat,
[ct=6698.444] as it was last year in Las Vegas at the end of the season when
[ct=6701.157] they could have had the tie on the--
[ct=6702.005] --run out here and the Kansas City Chiefs go to Arizona
[ct=6710.475] Beat their nemesis tonight.
[ct=6712.020] Andy Reid is now 100 games over .500.
[ct=6716.026] Sixth head coach in League history to get to that point,
[ct=6719.740] 235-135 and 1.
[ct=6721.402] And at least Justin Herbert will have the extra three days
[ct=6725.801] to get ready for the Chargers' next game.
[ct=6729.038] It's obviously early.
[ct=6729.922] But you've got a feeling that these two teams,
[ct=6733.492] along with Buffalo, are three of the more
[ct=6735.680] impressive-looking teams we've seen
[ct=6737.932] in the first couple of games in the NFL.
[ct=6743.539] Long way to Arizona.
[ct=6744.891] Spagnuolo telling Herbert, man--
[ct=6746.259] Stud.
[ct=6747.644] --you are a stud.
[ct=6748.959] They played the Jaguars at home a week from Sunday.
[ct=6756.807] Meanwhile, Kansas City goes to Indianapolis week 3 and then
[ct=6759.438] at the Buccaneers in a Sunday night game in week 4.
[ct=6765.642] This was the Play of the Game, the rookie, Watson.
[ct=6771.600] Watson.
[ct=6775.513] Here's Mahomes.
[ct=6777.494] Way to go, pal, he says to the kid.
[ct=6782.019] Herbert tries to bring them back.
[ct=6783.326] Again, magic to keep the game going.
[ct=6787.544] The onside, almost, almost, almost.
[ct=6791.315] But nope, no cigar.
[ct=6796.615] 27 to 24.
[ct=6797.918] Stick with us, Prime Video.
[ct=6799.264] The gang will take it from Kansas City
[ct=6801.913] after these messages.
