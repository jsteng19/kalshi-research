[ct=7.172] WEATHER, AND AWAY WE GO.
[ct=11.329] MOODY GOT HURT LAST WEEK.
[ct=13.021] HIS OPENING KICK IS A SHORT ONE.
[ct=15.877] HE HAS RUN BACK OUT PAST THE 20.
[ct=18.771] STILL WITH SPEED THROUGH THE 35
[ct=19.083] YARD LINE.
[ct=23.415] A NICE RUN BACK AFTER A SHORT
[ct=23.804] KICK.
[ct=27.527] HERE COMES GENO SMITH, WHO LEADS
[ct=27.836] THE LEAGUE IN PASSING YARDAGE.
[ct=34.142] 1466, HE'S THROWN FIVE TOUCHDOWN
[ct=36.535] PASSES, ONE IN EACH GAME AT FOUR
[ct=41.937] PICKS, HIS 12TH SEASON, QUITE
[ct=42.186] THE HONESTY FOR SMITH.
[ct=45.874] A FORMER JET, FORMER GIANT,
[ct=46.387] FORMER CHARGER.
[ct=48.548] NOW HE HAS COME INTO HIS OWN IN
[ct=48.792] SEATTLE.
[ct=51.230] KENNETH WALKER WAS THE RUNNING
[ct=53.815] BACK.
[ct=53.815] THEY NEED TO RUN THE BALL MORE
[ct=54.290] THAN THEY DID LAST WEEK.
[ct=58.277] THEY HAD FIVE CARRIES AGAINST
[ct=59.669] THE GIANTS.
[ct=61.021] THEY START RIGHT AWAY WITH HIM.
[ct=71.709] >> THIS KNEE WALL OFFENSIVE
[ct=72.287] SCHEME, NOT ONLY DO THEY HAVE A
[ct=72.862] NEW HEAD COACH OBVIOUSLY, YOU
[ct=73.410] BRING IN SOME NEW COORDINATORS,
[ct=78.528] RYAN IS ACTUALLY THE WASHINGTON
[ct=82.535] HUSKY OFFENSIVE CORDED WHO LED
[ct=83.845] THE MOTHER WOULD'VE THE NATIONAL
[ct=84.745] CHAMPIONSHIP, HE TAKES OVER,
[ct=85.306] TALKING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE THIS
[ct=85.852] WEEK IN SAN FRANCISCO
[ct=86.830] ESPECIALLY, THEY SAID YOU WILL
[ct=87.653] GET A LOT OF TEMPLE TONIGHT, A
[ct=88.694] LOT OF COLLEGE OFFENSE SRS HOW
[ct=89.219] FAST THEY CAN GO.
[ct=94.599] -- AS FAR AS HOW FAST THEY CAN
[ct=94.836] GO.
[ct=96.089] IT WILL ALLOW GENO SMITH TO MAKE
[ct=98.521] QUICK THROWS.
[ct=100.903] >> ON THE GROUND AGAIN.
[ct=101.422] BREAKING THE TACKLE.
[ct=107.815] MAKING THE TACKLE ON WALKER.
[ct=108.863] THE SEAHAWKS ARE AVERAGING 40
[ct=109.789] PASSES PER GAME COMING INTO THIS
[ct=110.090] GAME.
[ct=112.735] >> THAT HAS TO CHANGE.
[ct=114.834] IT'S GREAT THAT GENO SMITH HAS
[ct=115.393] BEEN ABLE TO PUT UP SOME BIG
[ct=117.511] NUMBERS.
[ct=118.836] HE SEEMS TO BE IN COMMAND IN
[ct=118.836] THIS NEW
[ct=124.157] BUT YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE PRESSURE
[ct=124.387] OFF THE OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=124.945] ESPECIALLY THE RIGHT SIDE.
[ct=128.175] THE THIRD GUY AT RIGHT TACKLE
[ct=128.436] AND STONE COURTSIDE, BY RUNNING
[ct=129.354] THE BALL YOU CANCEL DOWN BOTH
[ct=133.629] THE -- BOSA AND THE DEFENSE OF
[ct=136.243] PRESSURE.
[ct=139.916] >> THE BACK ON THIRD DOWN.
[ct=143.072] SMITH, LOOKING TO THROW FOR THE
[ct=144.423] FIRST TIME, AND COMPLETE IT,
[ct=149.769] ENTER 40 TERRITORY -- INTO 49ER
[ct=152.906] TERRITORY.
[ct=153.492] OVER THE MIDDLE TO METCALF.
[ct=153.954] THAT'S A GAME AT 30 YARDS.
[ct=156.203] >> THIS IS WHAT THE NINERS LIKE
[ct=157.768] TO DO, PRESSURE USING THE FLOOR.
[ct=159.291] THERE IS BOSA.
[ct=162.264] WATCH HOW HE POPS UP, AVOIDS THE
[ct=164.609] PRESSURE AND GETS METCALF.
[ct=168.898] >> A QUICK HUDDLE.
[ct=172.583] THE 49ERS, MINISTER VARIOUS
[ct=172.832] WARD, THE CORNERBACK.
[ct=173.396] THAT'S A BIG LOSS FOR THEM.
[ct=181.062] THAT WITH A BULKY NEED, INACTIVE
[ct=181.376] TONIGHT.
[ct=183.222] WE'LL SEE A LOT OF GUYS IN HIS
[ct=183.435] PLACE.
[ct=184.259] THERE'S IS A DRAW HERE.
[ct=187.162] HE GETS TO THE 26 YARD LINE.
[ct=190.330] STOPPED BY BROWN.
[ct=190.817] SECOND AND SIX.
[ct=194.856] >> WARD'S ONE OF THE BEST
[ct=196.728] CORNERS IN THE LEAGUE, VERY
[ct=198.853] PHYSICAL, LOOKS DEPRESSED, NOW
[ct=200.704] YOU SEE RENARDO GREEN WHO WILL
[ct=202.035] STEP IN, THEY WILL HAVE TO BE A
[ct=203.389] NICKEL WITH FIVE DEFENSIVE BACKS
[ct=204.196] AND THREE CORNERS OUT THERE,
[ct=204.196] HEREâ€™
[ct=206.741] HERE'S A LOOK AT WARD WHO WILL
[ct=210.147] BE TRY TO HELP GREEN OUT AS MUCH
[ct=212.759] AS HE CAN, BUT ALSO MENORAHS
[ct=214.051] PLAYING THAT NICKEL TONIGHT.
[ct=219.364] >> GREEN HAS JUST COME OUT,
[ct=227.561] BRICKS A TACKLE.
[ct=228.022] AND HE GETS AWAY -- IT GETS AWAY
[ct=228.463] FOR THE MOMENT.
[ct=230.294] ANOTHER THIRD DOWN COMING UP FOR
[ct=230.526] THE SEAHAWKS.
[ct=233.598] >> THE MOST APPRECIATED ASPECT
[ct=236.470] OF NICK BOSA'S GAME IS THIS
[ct=238.177] DANCE IS BEAUTIFUL BUT DEFENDING
[ct=240.245] THE RUN AND SETTING THE EDGE TO
[ct=243.130] THIS DEFENSE, WE ALL KNOW WHAT
[ct=244.117] PASS RUSHER HE IS COME HE LOOKS
[ct=245.653] INTO THE BACKFIELD AND KEEPS A
[ct=248.289] LEVERAGE TO THE DEFENSE, KEEPS
[ct=249.633] THEM FROM GETTING OUTSIDE OF HIM
[ct=252.314] , THAT STRENGTH FORCES HIM BACK
[ct=253.605] INSIDE AND THERE'S THE REST OF
[ct=256.292] THE NINERS DEFENSE ABLE TO CHASE
[ct=257.602] HIM DOWN.
[ct=261.598] >> TRIPS TO THE LEFT THIS TIME.
[ct=266.304] HANDS ON THE POCKET.
[ct=266.546] FIRES.
[ct=271.567] TOO DEEP AND INTERCEPTED AT THE
[ct=272.902] ONE YARD LINE.
[ct=275.461] ALL STOP A IS TAKING THE PLACE
[ct=282.523] OF MOVE -- OF MUSTAFA.
[ct=285.936] A BIG PICK AND AND OVERTHROWN
[ct=287.217] PASS.
[ct=288.074] SAN FRANCISCO TAKES OVER.
[ct=291.185] FIFTH PICK OF THE SEASON FOR
[ct=291.185] GENO SMITH.
[ct=293.880] COME BACK.
[ct=299.171] HE STARTS BY HANDING THE BALL
[ct=299.171] OFF.
[ct=305.777] JORDAN MASON HAS TAKEN OVER
[ct=308.429] MCCAFFREY'S ROLE UNTIL CHRIS
[ct=309.815] KNOW WHEN.
[ct=312.663] >> THE INTERCEPTION WAS BIG, A
[ct=312.663] LOT OF THOSE ROOKIES HAD
[ct=313.832] UP TONIGHT.
[ct=315.191] NICK BOSA GOT THE PRESSURE ON
[ct=315.191] THE PLAY.
[ct=317.809] SOMETIMES IT'S NOT ABOUT THE
[ct=320.524] SAKC, YOU SAW COLLINS ALSO
[ct=320.524] GETTING PRESSURE.
[ct=323.155] THE ROOKIE HAD GREAT TIGHT MAN
[ct=324.482] COVERAGE.
[ct=327.114] THERE'S MUSTAFA WHO STEPS RIGHT
[ct=328.455] IN FRONT OF
[ct=329.796] FOR THE PICK.
[ct=332.435] >> SECOND AND NINE.
[ct=337.747] OFF THE FAKE.
[ct=341.759] PURDY GETS OUT OF THE BACKFIELD
[ct=344.571] AND IS TAKEN DOWN AT THE 12 YARD
[ct=344.571] LINE, LEONARD WILLIAMS IS THERE
[ct=345.891] TO SECURE IT.
[ct=348.506] THIRD DOWN AND TWO FOR SAN
[ct=349.851] FRANCISCO.
[ct=352.542] >> YOU AND I WERE IN THIS
[ct=355.232] STADIUM TWO YEARS AGO, BROCK
[ct=355.232] PURDY HAD JUST TAKEN OVER,
[ct=357.858] EVERYBODY WAS WONDERING,
[ct=359.260] ASSISTANT QUARTERBACK, HOW GOOD
[ct=367.139] COULD HE BE?
[ct=368.425] YEAR, REALLY HAS TAKEN OVER THIS
[ct=369.790] THE BIG YEAR HE HAD A YEAR AGO,
[ct=371.110] HE ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AS A
[ct=372.449] PRESENCE IN THAT SPOT.
[ct=375.126] >> THE LAST GUY PICKED IN THE
[ct=377.797] DRAFT, DANCING AROUND, TRYING TO
[ct=384.379] PICK UP THAT AND DOES,
[ct=385.717] ESCAPING A COUPLE OF TIMES AND A
[ct=385.717] FIRST UP FOR THE 49ERS
[ct=387.049] THEIR OWN 15 YARD LINE.
[ct=391.060] >> THAT'S THE ASPECT OF THIS
[ct=392.352] GAME, WE SAW A LOT OF IT IN
[ct=395.037] COLLEGE AT IOWA STATE, BUT I
[ct=396.330] THINK MORE AND MORE YOU'RE
[ct=397.690] SITTING TO SEE WHAT HE CAN DO,
[ct=399.021] THE DEFENSE IS CONCERNED ABOUT
[ct=400.344] HIM BEING THE DISTRIBUTOR
[ct=401.651] ESPECIALLY ON THIRD DOWN BUT HIS
[ct=403.163] ATHLETIC ABILITY AND STRENGTH IN
[ct=404.358] HIS LOWER BODY ALLOWS HIM TO RUN
[ct=405.712] THROUGH SOME OF THOSE ARM
[ct=408.374] TACKLES TO KNOW WHERE THAT FIRST
[ct=409.686] OUT MARKER WAS.
[ct=411.080] >> HE GOT AWAY FROM JEROME
[ct=415.040] BAKER.
[ct=416.321] HE PICKS UP THE FIRST.
[ct=417.763] RUNNING INTO TRAFFIC BUT STILL
[ct=421.662] KEEPING THOSE LEGS GOING.
[ct=423.030] HANKINS IS THERE.
[ct=425.634] MASON AS A GUY WHO WAS A
[ct=429.648] FREE-AGENT, PLAYED AT GEORGIA
[ct=430.977] COULD HAVE FIGURED THAT HE WOULD
[ct=432.298] COME IN, HE IS THE SECOND
[ct=432.298] LEADING RUSHER I
[ct=433.614] RIGHT NOW.
[ct=437.622] >> IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING STORY,
[ct=438.951] OVER THE YEARS COME YOU THINK
[ct=438.951] ABOUT MIKE SHANAHAN, NOW KYLE
[ct=442.895] SHANAHAN, IT DOESN'
[ct=444.223] TO BE A TOP-FLIGHT RUNNING BACK
[ct=448.257] IN THEIR SYSTEM.
[ct=448.257] HERE'S ANOTHER CHAPTER IN THAT
[ct=449.549] STORY WITH JORDAN MASON AS AN
[ct=452.202] UNDRAFTED FREE AGENT THAT RUNS
[ct=453.548] VERY HARD, VERY PHYSICAL.
[ct=461.508] >> SECOND AND SIX, SAMUEL,
[ct=464.182] FIGHTING, COMES CLOSE TO PICKING
[ct=464.182] UP THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=468.121] THE 49ERS LOVE A LOT OF MOTION.
[ct=469.495] THEY LOVE A LOT OF EYE CANDY.
[ct=472.122] THAT ILLUSTRATION, RIGHT THERE.
[ct=474.823] >> SAMUEL HAS ALWAYS BEEN
[ct=476.105] INVOLVED IN THE RUN GAME BUT
[ct=477.439] WITH MCCAFFREY STILL DOWN,
[ct=480.147] MASON, AS MUCH AS WE ARE
[ct=481.426] BRAGGING ABOUT WHAT HE'S DONE,
[ct=482.747] HE'S A VERY DIFFERENT STYLE OF
[ct=484.096] RUNNER FROM CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY.
[ct=485.419] OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TO LEAN MORE
[ct=489.430] ON SAMUEL TO BE THAT GADGET GUY
[ct=490.716] TO BE ABLE TO GET YOU SOME JETS
[ct=494.704] BEAT AND REVERSES AND THINGS OF
[ct=496.027] IN HIS HANDS.
[ct=501.377] >> HE RUSHED 16 TIMES THIS
[ct=502.705] 17 RECEPTIONS.
[ct=504.017] THIRD AND ONE.
[ct=509.334] PURDY FIRES, OPEN, JUGGLING,
[ct=509.334] TAKEN DOWN IS SAMUEL.
[ct=513.280] HE RUNS FOR A FEW TO SET UP
[ct=514.505] A THIRD AND ONE CATCH AS THIS
[ct=514.505] ONE.
[ct=517.479] BOBBLED IT.
[ct=518.038] HE HAS TO COME UP FOR THE
[ct=518.283] MOMENT.
[ct=520.986] >> HOW ABOUT THE CALL BY
[ct=523.184] SHANAHAN?
[ct=523.769] DEEPENING YOUR OWN TERRITORY.
[ct=528.518] THEY ARE GOING TO RUN THE BALL,
[ct=528.722] KNOW THEY ARE NOT, NOT WITH KYLE
[ct=529.170] SHANAHAN.
[ct=531.955] WHAT AN EFFORT THERE BY SAMUEL
[ct=533.871] TO GET HIS RIGHT HAND UP AND GET
[ct=534.698] IT ABLE TO POSITION IT IN FRONT
[ct=537.595] OF HIM AND HAUL IT IN FOR THAT
[ct=539.563] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=540.327] A GREAT CALL AGAIN BY SHANAHAN.
[ct=550.827] >> TOSSED BACK.
[ct=553.537] NICE P
[ct=558.860] THERE GOES MASON.
[ct=558.860] INSIDE THE 40.
[ct=560.125] HE CAN'T GET IT.
[ct=564.119] AT THE VERY END, HE'S TAKEN DOWN
[ct=565.453] AFTER A GREAT BLOG EARLY ON BY
[ct=569.509] TRENT WILLIAMS -- BLOCK EARLY ON
[ct=569.509] BY TRENT WILLIAMS.
[ct=572.113] >> THIS IS SAN FRANCISCO
[ct=573.439] FOOTBALL RIGHT HERE, THEY TAKE
[ct=573.439] IT TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=576.069] WATCH BANKS ALSO.
[ct=576.069] THE LEFT SIDE DOES A GOOD
[ct=582.700] ON THE SWEEP, GETTING OUTSIDE,
[ct=583.361] LETTING HIM READ THAT ON HIS
[ct=583.949] THIRD STEP, HE GETS NORTH
[ct=586.309] AND SOUTH AND THAT'S WHERE THE
[ct=588.755] PHYSICALITY COMES IN, WITH HIM
[ct=589.424] COMING DOWNHILL LIKE THAT, THAT
[ct=592.979] IS A HANDFUL, BIG PHYSICAL BACK,
[ct=594.302] 225 POUNDER.
[ct=597.207] >> TIGHT FORMATION HERE,
[ct=598.614] SAMUEL LINES UP AS THE EYE BACK.
[ct=603.535] HE TAKES IT.
[ct=603.535] THROUGH THE MIDDLE HE GOES.
[ct=606.246] TO THE 23 YARD
[ct=611.533] GEORGE KITTLE, LAYING IN LINE
[ct=612.397] AND THAT ONE, MAKING THE BLOG.
[ct=612.397] SECOND DOWN.
[ct=614.419] >> WE TALKED ABOUT TRENT
[ct=618.373] WILLIAMS AND BANKS, YOU CANNOT
[ct=618.739] FORGET ABOUT 85 AND WHAT HE
[ct=619.240] DOES.
[ct=623.637] WHAT A BLOCK, JUST PANCAKES YOU.
[ct=626.312] I'M SURE HE HAD A FEW WORDS OUT
[ct=626.312] THERE ON THE FIELD.
[ct=630.352] GEORGE KITTLE, KIND OF A UNICORN
[ct=630.352] IN THIS ERA OF TIGHT ENDS.
[ct=635.607] THERE'S KELCE OUT THERE, SUCH A
[ct=635.607] TALENTED RECEIVER AS A TIGHT
[ct=637.051] END.
[ct=638.259] BUT KITTLE IS AN OLD-SCHOOL
[ct=639.571] GUY.
[ct=640.913] YOU CAN ALSO MA
[ct=642.254] THE PERIMETER.
[ct=644.899] >> CAN'T THINK OF ANYONE WHO
[ct=644.899] LOVES TO PLAY THE GAME MORE THAN
[ct=646.241] GEORGE KITTLE.
[ct=648.898] P, ESCAPING AGAIN --
[ct=652.906] PURDY, ESCAPING AGAIN, THROWING.
[ct=655.564] TO THE 10 YARD LINE GOES
[ct=658.342] JENNINGS, WHO HAS EMERGED THIS
[ct=658.342] SEASON.
[ct=660.841] JENKINS MAKES THE TACKLE.
[ct=663.478] THAT WILL SPOT THE 10 YARD LINE,
[ct=664.815] THEY GET A FIRST ANGLE AND A
[ct=664.815] DRIVE THAT STARTED BA
[ct=666.219] OWN THREE.
[ct=667.478] >> WHAT A JOB HERE WORKING WITH
[ct=670.129] THE QUARTERBACK, WITH PURDY AND
[ct=671.511] HIS ABILITY TO TAKE OFF, LOOKS
[ct=672.673] LIKE HE WENT BACK TO THE MIDDLE,
[ct=674.150] JENNINGS THERE, LOOKING
[ct=676.672] TRYING TO FIND A LINEBACKERS,
[ct=679.363] HE'S SITTING IN THAT SOFT SPOT
[ct=680.639] WHERE PURDY CAN FINE HIM, IS
[ct=684.826] ABOUT TO GIVE UP ON THE PLAY
[ct=684.826] AND FINDS 15 FOR ANOTHER BIG
[ct=686.126] PLAY.
[ct=686.126] WHAT A DRIVE BY THE NINERS.
[ct=690.120] >> NINE PLAYS, SEVEN RUSHERS,
[ct=692.810] HERE'S THE ACE, HEREâ€™S
[ct=694.111] TO THE SIX YARD LINE HERE GOES
[ct=696.739] -- HE GOES.
[ct=699.598] 4:40 T
[ct=700.757] QUARTER.
[ct=702.054] >> WE WERE
[ct=703.467] ABOUT WHAT TO WE THINK OF THIS
[ct=704.831] GAME AND ALL THE
[ct=710.021] >> ONE THING WE KNEW FOR CERTAIN
[ct=711.381] WAS THE 49ERS WOULD COME IN HERE
[ct=714.033] WITH SOME URGENCY.
[ct=714.033] LOSING LAST WEEK THE WAY THEY
[ct=716.666] DID, A COUPLE TOUGH LOSSES.
[ct=719.331] ON THE ROAD ON A SHORT WEEK.
[ct=720.631] YOU KNEW THAT PART OF IT, AND
[ct=721.981] BOY, THEY HAVE REALLY SET THE
[ct=724.620] TONE HERE IF THEY CAN PUNCH THIS
[ct=724.620] INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=728.621] AL: A GUT WRENCHING LOSS IN
[ct=729.944] THEIR HOME BUILDINGS LAST
[ct=731.294] SUNDAY.
[ct=732.652] SECOND AND GOAL.
[ct=736.655] PRETTY UNDER PRESSURE.
[ct=739.280] COVERAGE -- HE IS UNDER
[ct=740.568] BAKER IS BACK.
[ct=744.572] THE SEVENTH YEAR LINEBACKER OUT
[ct=744.572] OF OHIO STATE.
[ct=745.893] THIRD DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=749.910] THE 49ERS, YOU'RE RIGHT.
[ct=752.512] THEY WOULD BE TWO GAMES BEHIND
[ct=753.860] SEATTLE IF THEY LOSE AND BY THE
[ct=757.836] WAY, THEIR NEXT GAME, A WEEK
[ct=757.836] FROM SUNDAY, KANSAS CITY.
[ct=760.574] THIRD AND GOAL.
[ct=793.826] DECIMAL LEVEL IN THREE FIGURES.
[ct=794.473] TO THE END ZONE, ALL KINDS OF
[ct=794.662] ACTION.
[ct=795.394] DEEBO SAMUEL IS THERE.
[ct=796.443] HE WAS JUST ACTIVATED TONIGHT.
[ct=798.669] COMING IN AND THEY ARE MINUS ONE
[ct=799.618] OF THEIR TOP BACKS.
[ct=800.136] HE IS THE GUY TAKING THE SPOT
[ct=801.161] AND MAKE A BIG PLAY HERE.
[ct=804.388] GREAT JOB COMMUNICATING WITH A
[ct=805.792] CORNER WHO HAS NOT PLAYED A LOT
[ct=806.151] OF FOOTBALL.
[ct=810.717] DEEBO SAMUEL LINES THE INSIDE,
[ct=811.290] JUST TRYING TO CONFUSE SEATTLE
[ct=813.966] BUT ABLE TO PASS IT OFF.
[ct=815.775] BURNS WAS RIGHT THERE IN TIGHT
[ct=816.590] GREAT JOB.
[ct=820.227] >> MOODY GOT HURT LAST WEEK.
[ct=823.832] THEY HAVE FOUR GUYS COME IN AND
[ct=823.832] MATTHEW WRIGHT WHO HAS BEEN
[ct=826.554] 49ER IS GOOD
[ct=827.183] TO PUT THE FIRST POINTS OF THE
[ct=829.422] GAME ON THE BOARD.
[ct=838.891] 3:58 TO GO INSHARPIE IN THE SOCK
[ct=840.157] BIG SCORE AS WELL, LEADING THEM
[ct=841.442] TO A VICTORY.
[ct=844.162] IT WAS GOING TO BE RETURNABLE
[ct=845.496] AND IT IS RETURNABLE NOW.
[ct=850.754] TO THE 10 YARD LINE, IT BOUNCED
[ct=853.435] A ROOKIE FROM TENNESSEE
[ct=854.730] IT OUT.
[ct=854.730] LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT
[ct=858.738] BOSA.
[ct=862.733] KIRK: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR
[ct=864.017] STATS, POWERED BY AWS.
[ct=868.010] KEEP AN EYE ON 97, THIRD DOWN
[ct=869.352] SPIRIT .67 IS HIS AVERAGE
[ct=870.687] TAKEOFF, THE QUICKEST IN THE
[ct=874.697] HE GETS DOWN IN THAT STANCE.
[ct=876.000] WE SAW IT IN THE OPENING DRIVE,
[ct=878.674] FORCED THE QUICK PASS BY
[ct=879.952] SMITH THAT LED TO THE
[ct=879.952] INTERCEPTION.
[ct=889.253] AL: HIS SIXTH YEAR OUT OF OHIO
[ct=889.253] STATE, GREAT
[ct=890.658] GOING NOWHERE.
[ct=894.639] KENNETH WALKER -- WHAT DOES IT
[ct=895.932] TWO THIRDS OF A SECOND.
[ct=898.631] PEOPLE GO A SECOND
[ct=899.971] MISSISSIPPI.
[ct=899.971] SO WHAT IS THAT?
[ct=902.728] KIRK: THAT IS ABOUT ALL YOU GET.
[ct=905.806] AL: NO-HUDDLE HERE.
[ct=910.261] THERE GOES WALKER AND HE GETS
[ct=910.793] TAKEN DOWN BEFORE HE CAN PICK UP
[ct=913.883] THE FIRST DOWN ABOUT TWO YARDS
[ct=914.132] SHIVE.
[ct=917.229] KENNETH WALKER TAKING IT OUT TO
[ct=919.451] THE 18 YARD LINE.
[ct=919.683] THIRD DOWN AND TWO.
[ct=923.235] KIRK: FINALLY, THERE IS SOME
[ct=924.049] ROOM TO WORK.
[ct=925.792] IT HAS BEEN TOUGH FOR KENNETH
[ct=927.106] WALKER THIS YEAR AND A BIG HIT
[ct=929.994] BY THE ROOKIE COMING UP THERE,
[ct=930.674] KEEPING HIM SHORT OF THE FIRST
[ct=931.047] DOWN.
[ct=933.552] >> HE ALREADY HAD THE PICK.
[ct=939.064] THERE HE IS AGAIN.
[ct=940.706] THE TWO ROOKIES ON THE SECONDARY
[ct=946.340] THE 49ERS BRING PRESSURE HERE.
[ct=949.543] THEY DON'T.
[ct=952.061] JUST A FOUR MAN RASH.
[ct=955.752] THE PAST INTO A LOT OF TRAFFIC
[ct=956.099] PULLED IN BY THE TIGHT END, NOAH
[ct=957.575] SAM.
[ct=960.149] KIRK: THAT IS TOUGH AGAINST
[ct=960.482] WARNER.
[ct=962.722] ALWAYS A TIGHT WINDOW.
[ct=968.234] GOING UP AGAINST 54 WHO IS AS
[ct=969.565] GOOD AS THERE IS IN COVERAGE.
[ct=971.069] HE IS SHOWING A LITTLE BIT OF
[ct=971.471] PRESSURE AND THEN GETS OUT.
[ct=973.534] HE WILL MOVE OVER THERE.
[ct=977.018] A GOOD JOB OF THROWING THE BALL
[ct=978.011] AWAY TO THE OUTSIDE SHOULDER BY
[ct=981.814] GENO SMITH AND AWAY FROM 54.
[ct=994.615] >> THE EXTRA MAN COMES.
[ct=996.124] TAKEN OUT OF THE PLAY.
[ct=997.070] THE PASS TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=997.343] NOTHING THERE.
[ct=1000.999] METCALF, DOUBLE COVERAGE.
[ct=1001.603] TWO MINUTES TO GO IN THE
[ct=1005.303] >> RUNNING THE FOOTBALL, A LOT
[ct=1006.115] OF DIFFERENT FORMATIONS, TRYING
[ct=1009.476] TO MAKE THIS SAN FRANCISCO
[ct=1010.195] DEFENSE HAVE TO THINK THAT TIME
[ct=1011.566] WITH TWO TIGHT ENDS, THEY WERE
[ct=1013.678] SHOWING THE WAY THEY HAVE BEEN
[ct=1015.012] RUNNING THE BALL.
[ct=1016.041] FIRST AND 10, THEY ARE GOING TO
[ct=1016.360] RUN THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=1017.286] PLAY-ACTION.
[ct=1020.299] TRY THE NINERS NAPPING A BIT AND
[ct=1023.059] GO WITH TIGHT COVERAGE ON
[ct=1023.260] METCALF.
[ct=1030.078] AL: THERE IS THE PLAYER LINING
[ct=1030.400] UP A WIDE.
[ct=1035.554] TAKE HIM OUT OF THE PLAY.
[ct=1038.236] THE PAST IS INCOMPLETE HERE,
[ct=1038.997] TRYING TO GO HIS WAY.
[ct=1043.285] HE KNOCKED IT DOWN, THIRD AND
[ct=1043.643] 10.
[ct=1047.387] >> HE IS -- ONE OF THE THINGS
[ct=1048.240] ABOUT HIM EARLY IN HIS CAREER,
[ct=1051.133] HE USED HIS HANDS WELL AND
[ct=1052.236] LATELY, SEEMS LIKE HEâ€™
[ct=1052.484] LATELY, SEEMS LIKE HE'S USING
[ct=1052.773] HIS BODY.
[ct=1057.325] THAT WAS A BALL THAT MAY BE GET
[ct=1059.005] TOUCHED BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A BALL
[ct=1059.280] TO HIT BOTH HIS HANDS.
[ct=1062.160] I AM SURE HE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO
[ct=1063.561] HAVE BROUGHT THAT ONE IN.
[ct=1067.827] >> SPLIT THEM OUT TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=1071.268] THE THIRD DOWN BACK IN THE
[ct=1071.546] BACKFIELD.
[ct=1076.101] ALONG WITH THE TIGHT END.
[ct=1078.594] THEY BOTH GO OUT AND THE PASS IS
[ct=1081.832] INCOMPLETE ON -- A LOT OF WHITE
[ct=1082.279] JERSEYS AROUND METCALF.
[ct=1085.627] HE HAD A CROWD ON HIS FOURTH
[ct=1089.544] WHAT'S PRETTY GOOD JOB ON THE
[ct=1092.659] RIGHT SIDE BY FORSYTH, GIVING
[ct=1094.891] GENO SMITH ENOUGH TIME.
[ct=1097.797] JUST THEY'RE JUST IN CASE TO
[ct=1097.797] HELP OUT.
[ct=1101.485] THE CROWD IS REACTING TO THE
[ct=1105.477] SAME THING METCALF REACTED TO.
[ct=1106.451] BEFORE HE GOT TO THE TOP OF
[ct=1107.183] THEIR OUT, THERE WAS A LITTLE
[ct=1108.972] BIT OF A GRAB AROUND THE HIP.
[ct=1114.559] >> MICHAEL DICKSON, ONE OF THE
[ct=1115.411] BEST IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=1118.363] SKYWARD.
[ct=1122.874] SLIPS.
[ct=1126.949] THERE WAS METCALF GETTING ON THE
[ct=1129.025] PHONE.
[ct=1131.480] WHAT IS GOING ON DOWN HERE?
[ct=1135.212] FROM THE 24 YARD LINE, THE 49ERS
[ct=1135.586] HAVE THE BALL.
[ct=1142.380] ALMOST GETS THE FIRST.
[ct=1144.608] HE IS A YARDS SHIVE, SECOND AND
[ct=1145.537] JENKINS MAKES THE STOP.
[ct=1149.263] KAYLEE: TO PARAPHRASE,
[ct=1150.702] METCALF IS TELLING THE SIDELINE
[ct=1151.955] HE DOESN'T NEED ANY POSITIVE
[ct=1152.213] WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT.
[ct=1155.314] HE IS OVER THE PEP TOP SPEED --
[ct=1157.634] PEP TALKS.
[ct=1161.678] AL: IT WENT OVER THREE TIMES ON
[ct=1161.942] THAT DRIVE.
[ct=1162.304] FRUSTRATION.
[ct=1168.057] SECOND AND ONE.
[ct=1175.372] THIS TIME, HE GETS STOPPED.
[ct=1180.711] TERREL DODSON CAME OVER FROM
[ct=1180.973] BUFFALO.
[ct=1186.240] >> IF YOU WATCH THE GIANTS LAST
[ct=1186.240] WEEK, THEY RAN THE BALL REALLY
[ct=1188.380] WELL ASKED WEEK AGAINST HIS
[ct=1192.736] DEFENSE AND HE WAS TALKING THIS
[ct=1193.809] WEEK TO MIKE MACDONALD WHO CALLS
[ct=1194.674] THE DEFENSE AS A HEAD COACH.
[ct=1198.262] IT IS ALMOST LIKE HE TOOK IT ON
[ct=1198.961] HIMSELF BECAUSE HE TAKES A LOT
[ct=1201.861] OF PRIDE IN BEING PART OF THAT
[ct=1202.219] UNIT.
[ct=1203.637] HE SAID THAT BALL IS ON ME AND I
[ct=1205.392] GOT TO MAKE SURE MY GUYS KNOW
[ct=1205.857] THE CAUSE AND WE COMMUNICATE.
[ct=1209.046] WE HAVE TO GET OFF BLOCKS.
[ct=1210.750] SO FAR, DOING A GOOD JOB IN THE
[ct=1211.804] INTERIOR, MUCH BETTER THAN THEY
[ct=1212.203] DID A WEEK AGO.
[ct=1216.529] AL: DECIBEL LEVEL, 101.
[ct=1220.074] IT IS BROKEN UP.
[ct=1225.102] JULIAN LOVE KNOCKED IT DOWN,
[ct=1226.389] FORCED DOWN, 49ERS TO KICK.
[ct=1232.818] >> YOU KNOW, NICE
[ct=1234.139] LOVE.
[ct=1235.451] WHEN KITTLE MOVED FROM THE RIGHT
[ct=1239.475] TO THE LEFT, HE WAS BACK HERE
[ct=1240.805] AND HE JUST KIND OF WALKS DOWN.
[ct=1242.075] NOW, HE IS IN POSITION TO TAKE
[ct=1242.075] HIM.
[ct=1243.453] IT IS A HECK BATTLE.
[ct=1246.997] MADE IT EASY.
[ct=1247.489] NICE JOB BEING IN POSITION.
[ct=1250.924] >> MITCH HAVE TO COME IN AND
[ct=1253.352] KICK LAST WEEK THROUGHOUT THE
[ct=1254.256] FIRST FLAG OF THE GAME.
[ct=1254.592] HOW ABOUT THAT?
[ct=1258.915] PLAYED 14 MINUTES AND 41 SECONDS
[ct=1261.635] AND WE WILL HEAR FROM CRAIG
[ct=1261.971] WROLSTAD FOR THE FIRST TIME
[ct=1265.589] >> OFFENSE.
[ct=1268.255] NUMBER 50.
[ct=1270.949] THE FIVE YARD PENALTY STILL GOES
[ct=1277.533] >> LAST -- AL: LAST WEEK, WHEN
[ct=1279.204] HE GOT HURT, HAD TO COME AND GET
[ct=1280.289] AN EXTRA POINT BUT THAT REALLY
[ct=1282.245] FACTORED INTO THE STRATEGY OF
[ct=1283.476] THAT GAME, NOT HAVING A GUY THE
[ct=1283.698] FIELD GOAL.
[ct=1286.314] KIRK: FOURTH AND 23.
[ct=1288.679] AL: HE DID NOT HAVE TO, BUT HE
[ct=1289.020] DID.
[ct=1295.548] FAIR CALL AT THE LAST SECOND BY
[ct=1295.805] WILLIAMS.
[ct=1305.206] AL: WANING SECONDS OF THE
[ct=1307.642] QUARTER, WIDE LEFT.
[ct=1312.645] A COUPLE OF PIECES AROUND.
[ct=1313.416] WALKER IS THE RUNNING BACK.
[ct=1321.648] GENO SMITH HANDS IT TO HIM.
[ct=1323.047] HE WILL TAKE IT TO THE 31.
[ct=1325.854] FRED WARNER MAKES THE TACKLE AND
[ct=1328.364] THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE SECOND
[ct=1330.734] THE END OF THE FIRST, SAN
[ct=1336.640] FRANCISCO 3, SEATTLE 0, ON
[ct=1336.640] THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL.
[ct=1342.858] OVER A BEAUTIFUL SHOT OF THE
[ct=1347.377] STADIUM, DOWNTOWN SEATTLE.
[ct=1348.869] WE GO TO LOUISIANA NEXT WEEK.
[ct=1350.281] IT WILL BE THE BRONCOS AND THE
[ct=1351.153] SAINTS ON THURSDAY NIGHT
[ct=1351.491] FOOTBALL.
[ct=1354.014] SEAN PAYTON RETURNING TO THE BIG
[ct=1356.030] EASY, NEXT THURSDAY NIGHT.
[ct=1358.585] WE START THE SECOND QUARTER.
[ct=1362.070] A HANDOFF HERE TO THE OUTSIDE,
[ct=1362.480] TURNING THE CORNER.
[ct=1366.423] AND PICKING UP ABOUT FOUR IS
[ct=1367.073] KENNETH WALKER, THIRD DOWN.
[ct=1371.166] KIRK: THIS SEATTLE OFFENSE LAST
[ct=1373.240] WEEK IN THE GIANTS GAME, IT WAS
[ct=1376.176] AN UNUSUAL GAME BUT THE RUNNING
[ct=1377.801] BACK POSITION ONLY HAD SEVEN
[ct=1378.140] CARRIES.
[ct=1380.077] FIVE FOR KENNETH WALKER, TWO FOR
[ct=1382.716] THE OTHER AND IN THIS FIRST HALF
[ct=1383.334] ALREADY, WE ARE SEEING A MUCH
[ct=1385.621] MORE DETERMINED PLAY CALLER
[ct=1387.716] GETTING THE BALL INTO THESE
[ct=1387.716] HANDS.
[ct=1389.058] AT SOME POINT, YOU GOT TO FEEL
[ct=1391.476] WHAT A GREAT MATCHUP WITH
[ct=1393.828] JACKSON SMITH IN THAT SLOT.
[ct=1399.162] AL: THIRD AND THREE.
[ct=1405.996] WALKER, AND IT IS BUSTED OUT
[ct=1407.351] BEFORE HE CAN PICK UP THE FIRST
[ct=1413.953] FRED WARNER, SEVENTH YEAR, BYU,
[ct=1415.341] WHAT A GUY, A GUY WHO HAS MISSED
[ct=1417.242] ONLY ONE GAME PLAYING MIDDLE
[ct=1418.823] LINEBACKER IN SEVEN SEASONS.
[ct=1422.198] KIRK: WATCH THE INSTINCTS.
[ct=1424.209] HE FEELS THIS SCREEN RIGHT AWAY.
[ct=1425.090] HE'S GOT TO GET BETWEEN THOSE
[ct=1426.885] LINEMEN WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT HE
[ct=1429.780] DID AND THEN HIT A REALLY
[ct=1430.526] TALENTED BACK AND HE DOESN'T LET
[ct=1431.721] HIM GET THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1432.208] WHAT A PLAY.
[ct=1436.185] AL: SECOND.
[ct=1441.614] TOWARD THE SIDELINE, BOUNCES OUT
[ct=1441.982] OF BOUNDS INSIDE THE 25 YARD
[ct=1442.386] LINE.
[ct=1443.622] THE DAY MCDONALD GETS AMASSED AS
[ct=1445.266] THE HEAD COACH ON JANUARY 31.
[ct=1448.688] >> GREAT THING ABOUT WHAT MIKE
[ct=1449.464] MACDONALD IS DOING, HE LEARNED A
[ct=1452.606] LOT FROM THEM BUT HE IS KEEPING
[ct=1454.667] AT HIS OWN WAY OF DOING IT HERE
[ct=1456.909] IN SEATTLE, UTILIZING THE TOOLS
[ct=1459.291] THAT THEY TAUGHT HIM BUT GIVING
[ct=1459.822] IT HIS OWN PERSONALITY.
[ct=1467.480] AL: WIDE OPEN, MAKING SAMUEL --
[ct=1467.745] THE TACKLE IS MISSED.
[ct=1468.072] OFF TO THE END ZONE.
[ct=1471.374] TOUCHDOWN, 49ERS.
[ct=1476.074] 76 YARDS.
[ct=1483.159] GOT FREE, BROKE A TACKLE, SPUN
[ct=1485.577] AWAY.
[ct=1486.229] OFF HE GOES TO THE RACES.
[ct=1490.655] KIRK: GREAT JOB HERE UTILIZING
[ct=1491.295] THE RECEIVER.
[ct=1493.658] TAKES THE CORNER WITH HIM.
[ct=1496.121] SAFETY GETS OVERLAID, TAKES A
[ct=1498.174] CHANCE RIGHT THERE BY TRYING TO
[ct=1499.414] -- ALMOST MISSED HIM WHEN HE WAS
[ct=1500.091] TRYING TO GO EITHER FOR THE
[ct=1502.702] FOOTBALL OR HIT DEEBO SAMUEL BUT
[ct=1504.972] THAT IS A TOUGH THING TO DO AN
[ct=1505.838] OPEN SPACE BUT THE DESIGN OF
[ct=1509.538] THAT OPENPLAY, THE FOREIGNER --
[ct=1512.455] CORNER FOLLOWED HIM TO THE
[ct=1513.129] OUTSIDE AND NOBODY IS THERE ON
[ct=1513.495] SAMUEL.
[ct=1515.806] >> EXTRA POINT IS GOOD.
[ct=1519.193] 1:30 INTO THE SECOND QUARTER,
[ct=1521.646] THE 49ERS ARE UP 10-0 ON THE
[ct=1521.942] ROAD.
[ct=1528.056] NOW FOR THE THURSDAY
[ct=1530.385] NIGHT SPOTLIGHT, PRESENTED BY
[ct=1530.745] POPEYES.
[ct=1531.522] WELL-DESIGNED PLAY AGAIN.
[ct=1532.998] YOU TAKE HIM INTO THE INSIDE
[ct=1533.299] CORNER, GOES WITH HIM.
[ct=1535.954] WATCH THE SLIGHT HESITATION.
[ct=1540.565] ALMOST GOES ON A RAIL ROUTE DOWN
[ct=1541.693] THE SIDELINE.
[ct=1542.353] NOBODY PICKS HIM UP.
[ct=1544.447] THE BALL WAS THROWN BACK WHICH
[ct=1546.616] IS A GREAT JOB BY PURDY.
[ct=1548.562] COULD MAYBE GET A HAND ON IT AND
[ct=1550.949] WATCH BROCK PURDY SETTLE
[ct=1552.481] MOVEMENT IN THE POCKET, FEEL,
[ct=1555.257] LOCATION, PERFECT.
[ct=1555.829] SAMUEL FIGHTS BACK TO THE
[ct=1561.680] FOOTBALL AND THE NINERS, WHO HAD
[ct=1561.920] 20 COMPLETIONS OF 20 YARDS OR
[ct=1563.212] MORE WHICH IS TIED FOR THE MOST
[ct=1563.720] WITH THE PACKERS.
[ct=1566.493] THEY HIT ANOTHER ONE FOR A BIG
[ct=1566.493] SCORE.
[ct=1570.336] >> RUN IT BACK HERE.
[ct=1573.670] HE HAD A GOOD RUN ON THE OPENING
[ct=1573.670] HERE.
[ct=1575.217] THE BALL IS LOOSE.
[ct=1580.846] 49ERS HAVE IT.
[ct=1581.456] HERE COME THE OFFICIALS WHO HAS
[ct=1581.456] GOT IT?
[ct=1587.640] SAN FRANCISCO.
[ct=1594.260] >> THAT IS A BIG QUESTION.
[ct=1598.625] WAS HE DOWN WHEN THE BALL CA
[ct=1598.994] OUT?
[ct=1600.440] I MEAN, HE WAS GOING TOWARDS THE
[ct=1602.558] SURFACE.
[ct=1603.967] DID THEY GET A HAND ON IT BEFORE
[ct=1604.520] HE TOUCHES THE GROUND?
[ct=1606.885] IT IS OUT.
[ct=1609.755] THE BALL CAME OUT BEFORE THAT
[ct=1610.413] RIGHT KNEE HIT.
[ct=1618.863] AL: DARRELL TAYLOR MAKES THE
[ct=1622.602] CONTACT -- HE MAKES THE CONTACT.
[ct=1625.946] WITH THE RECOVERY.
[ct=1628.543] THE BALL IS COMING OUT RIGHT
[ct=1628.801] THERE.
[ct=1633.893] JUST BEFORE THE KNEE HITS, MUCH
[ct=1634.439] TO THE DISPLEASURE OF THE CROWD,
[ct=1638.230] LOOKING AT THE REPLAY, AND NOW,
[ct=1642.338] THE 49ERS ALREADY UP BY 10.
[ct=1643.927] THE RULING IS CONFIRMED.
[ct=1645.414] TAKE OVER THE 29 YARD LINE.
[ct=1654.827] SECOND AND FULLBACK.
[ct=1659.767] MASON TO THE -- I'M LOOKING AT
[ct=1660.953] PROPERTY AND EVERYBODY SAYS, YOU
[ct=1662.787] KNOW, HE HAS A GREAT SYSTEM AND
[ct=1663.748] A GREAT COACH.
[ct=1665.632] MEANWHILE, HE LED THE LEAGUE IN
[ct=1668.598] YARDS PER PASS LAST YEAR.
[ct=1669.312] A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY
[ct=1671.199] A LOT OF YARDS AFTER CONTACT HE
[ct=1671.924] IS PRETTY GOOD.
[ct=1676.524] >> HE IS A GREAT EXTENSION OF
[ct=1677.225] KYLE SHANAHAN.
[ct=1677.927] KYLE SHANAHAN, THEY TOOK A
[ct=1678.208] CHANCE ON HIM.
[ct=1681.386] THEY TOOK A CHANCE ON HIM
[ct=1683.272] BECAUSE OF ALL THE WORK THAT
[ct=1683.879] THEY DID LEADING INTO THE DRAFT.
[ct=1686.867] HE IS A PERFECT FIT FOR WHAT
[ct=1686.867] THEY DO.
[ct=1690.363] AL: VERY EVEN KEEL GUY.
[ct=1694.672] HE'S GOT SOME EXTENSION NEXT
[ct=1695.021] YEAR.
[ct=1698.658] MEANWHILE, HE FIGHTS HIS WAY --
[ct=1699.904] HE IS UNDER $1 MILLION, RIGHT?
[ct=1704.043] DAK PRESCOTT IS A MILLION
[ct=1704.043] DOLLARS.
[ct=1707.481] >> IS THINK HE WILL DO OK.
[ct=1710.141] AL: I THINK KYLE SHANAHAN TOLD
[ct=1713.111] US -- THE BIGGEST THING YOU CAN
[ct=1713.413] SAY ABOUT HIM IS HE IS JUST
[ct=1717.059] COMFORTABLE IN HIS OWN SKIN AND
[ct=1717.795] WHO HE IS AS A PERSON.
[ct=1718.952] FORGET ABOUT FOOTBALL.
[ct=1722.109] EVERYTHING ABOUT THE WAY HE
[ct=1723.664] CARRIES HIMSELF, HE DOES NOT
[ct=1724.129] REALLY GET CAUGHT UP IN ALL THE
[ct=1726.987] NOISE OR TRYING TO PROVE PEOPLE
[ct=1727.409] WRONG.
[ct=1730.421] HE'S TRYING TO STUDY THIS FILM
[ct=1730.421] AND GET
[ct=1731.718] BETTER IN THIS OFFENSE.
[ct=1737.036] >> 81ST HIGHEST-PAID QUARTERBACK
[ct=1737.036] IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=1738.279] LOOK OUT.
[ct=1738.279] SCRAMBLES AWAY.
[ct=1743.830] AVOIDS A BIG-TIME SACK AND THEN
[ct=1746.462] FIRES IT OUT OF BOUNDS, FOURTH
[ct=1749.387] A LOT OF YARDAGE ON THE PLAY.
[ct=1753.274] >> IN FRONT OF HIM, CHASING, AND
[ct=1753.274] THAT IS WHERE THE CONTACT WAS.
[ct=1757.250] HE MADE CONTACT BUT YOU KNOW,
[ct=1759.913] BROCK PURDY, LIKE ANY SMART
[ct=1759.913] QUARTERBACK, AS SOON AS YOU GET
[ct=1763.906] TOUCHED, YOU JUST FALL, WHETHER
[ct=1763.906] YOU GET HIT HARD OR NOT.
[ct=1767.876] NO FOUL AND A GOOD STUFF BY THE
[ct=1767.876] SEAHAWKS THERE.
[ct=1769.487] >> HERE COMES THE NEW KICKER.
[ct=1772.471] HE THREW IT AWAY.
[ct=1773.873] SCOTT ALSO HAD A GREAT ONE FOR
[ct=1774.783] TODAY.
[ct=1779.733] THE 49ERS ONLY HOPE HIS NICKNAME
[ct=1780.166] WAS NOT THAT.
[ct=1788.934] MATTHEW RIGHT, 41 YARDNOT FAR FR
[ct=1792.108] SEATTLE ON A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT.
[ct=1793.551] NOT SO BEAUTIFUL FOR THE
[ct=1794.819] SEAHAWKS TO THIS POINT.
[ct=1798.821] NINERS ON TOP, 13-0.
[ct=1804.086] HE IS BACK TO RECEIVE THE KICK
[ct=1805.530] ALONG WITH WILLIAMS WHO HAD THE
[ct=1805.530] FUMBLE.
[ct=1809.423] AND THIS T HIS
[ct=1810.774] CAREER IS JUST GOING TO BE AS A
[ct=1812.026] BACKUP.
[ct=1812.026] HE GETS THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN
[ct=1816.096] RUSSELL LEADS AND TONIGHT, THEY
[ct=1816.761] GOT METCALF INVOLVED BUT THEY
[ct=1817.508] HAVE NOT THROWN THE FOOTBALL AT
[ct=1819.107] ALL TO JACKSON SMITH.
[ct=1821.740] AL: NOT YET.
[ct=1825.594] THEY GO NOWHERE HERE.
[ct=1827.583] 49ERS, SO TOUGH AT THE LINE OF
[ct=1828.032] SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=1832.649] HAVING A HECK OF A NIGHT ALREADY
[ct=1835.517] ALONG WITH ROBERT DEAL.
[ct=1836.849] SECOND AND 13.
[ct=1839.793] >> GOOD JOB THERE.
[ct=1841.194] A LITTLE TEMPO.
[ct=1842.106] GET THE NINERS DEFENSE A IT ON
[ct=1842.362] THEIR HEELS.
[ct=1847.737] >> IT IS OFFICIAL.
[ct=1853.679] AL: MOVING GUYS ALL OVER THE
[ct=1854.222] PLACE HERE.
[ct=1858.019] GOING TO THE RIGHT SIDE, IN THE
[ct=1858.376] SLOT.
[ct=1862.748] HE'S GOING TO TAKE OFF AND
[ct=1866.728] SLIDES TO A STOP WITH THE FLAG
[ct=1867.498] PRONET THE 35 YARD LINE.
[ct=1875.982] >> HOLDING OFFENSE.
[ct=1880.022] NUMBER 67.
[ct=1881.074] FIVE YARD PENALTY.
[ct=1881.845] 10 YARD PENALTY, SECOND DOWN.
[ct=1886.329] AL: THAT IS CHARLES CROSS.
[ct=1887.400] THE FIRST ROUND OUT OF
[ct=1888.195] MISSISSIPPI STATE IN 2022.
[ct=1892.958] KIRK: I THINK THEY SAID 67 BUT
[ct=1895.112] CONNOR WILLIAMS ACTUALLY WAS THE
[ct=1898.335] GUILTY PARTY.
[ct=1899.281] THE LEFT TACKLE WAS FINE ON THE
[ct=1903.600] CONNOR WILLIAMS MOVED TO THE
[ct=1906.324] INSIDE AND HE JUST GRABS ON.
[ct=1910.313] AL: HE WAS LOOKING UP AT THE
[ct=1912.156] BOARD GOING, HUH?
[ct=1915.644] HE TAKES THE BALL OUT TO
[ct=1919.106] SECOND AND 23.
[ct=1920.861] NOW, THIRD DOWN AND EIGHT.
[ct=1924.366] KIRK: THIS DEFENSE SO FAR HAS
[ct=1925.870] DONE A HECKUVA JOB.
[ct=1927.208] GOT A LOT OF INJURIES BUT THEY
[ct=1928.565] ARE DOING A GOOD JOB OF TRYING
[ct=1931.047] TO GET THIS OFFENSE IN OBVIOUS
[ct=1931.468] PASSING SITUATIONS.
[ct=1935.425] AL: QUICKLY AGAIN, SMITH.
[ct=1939.316] TOO HIGH AGAIN AND THAT PASS IS
[ct=1939.316] INCOMPLETE.
[ct=1943.254] KIRK: BOSA MOVING THERE.
[ct=1945.920] >> DEFENSE, NUMBER 97.
[ct=1946.843] THIRD DOWN.
[ct=1951.234] KIRK: TRYING TO GET THAT BIG
[ct=1951.486] START.
[ct=1953.057] WE TALKED ABOUT .67, THE
[ct=1953.462] QUICKEST JUMP.
[ct=1956.728] THIS IS EVEN QUICKER THAN THAT
[ct=1958.248] RIGHT HERE, GOES BEFORE THE BALL
[ct=1959.605] IS SNAPPED.
[ct=1959.936] GENO SMITH HAD THE FREE PLAY AND
[ct=1962.601] THROWS IT HIGH TO GIVE THIS GUY
[ct=1964.014] A CHANCE.
[ct=1964.294] TAKE THE FIVE YARD.
[ct=1970.387] AL: IT WAS SECOND AND 23, BUT
[ct=1972.032] NOW, IT IS THIRD AND THREE.
[ct=1977.087] EARLY IN THE SECOND QUARTER, THE
[ct=1978.471] NINERS REALIGNED THEIR SECONDARY
[ct=1981.694] AS THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=1981.968] NOT EVEN CLOSE THAT TIME.
[ct=1984.806] HE IS OFF THE MARK.
[ct=1988.884] HE IS FOUR OF NINE TONIGHT FOR
[ct=1989.623] 53 YARDS AND ANOTHER POND.
[ct=1994.041] KIRK: IT IS JUST THE REPUTATION
[ct=1995.077] OF A GUY LIKE NICK BOSA WHO CAN
[ct=1995.635] AFFECT THE QUARTERBACK.
[ct=1999.331] WATCH HOW HE FALLS OFF THIS
[ct=1999.331] THROW, KIND OF FALLS BACK.
[ct=2002.304] HE DID NOT GET ANYTHING INTO
[ct=2003.549] THAT AND I THINK IT AFFECTED HIS
[ct=2003.881] ACCURACY.
[ct=2007.886] AL: IT'S A BEAUTY.
[ct=2011.708] THE SIX YARD LINE.
[ct=2017.206] THE 49ERS WILL TAKE OVER AT THAT
[ct=2019.563] SPOT WITH 10:16 LEFT
[ct=2021.246] FIRST HALF.
[ct=2025.321] METCALF TONIGHT HAS TARGETED
[ct=2026.166] ONLY FOUR TIMES, ONLY ONE CATCH.
[ct=2030.300] KIRK: EASY ROUTE UNDERNEATH.
[ct=2035.765] IT WAS WIDE OPEN AND SO FAR,
[ct=2037.936] EARLY IN THE GAME, GENO SMITH IS
[ct=2040.000] KIND OF A STREAKY QUARTERBACK.
[ct=2041.556] THERE WILL BE MOMENTS IF YOU CAN
[ct=2042.735] MAKE HIM FEEL THAT RUSH, HE IS
[ct=2045.603] JUST NOT THE SAME GUY BUT IF HE
[ct=2047.794] HAS A CLEAN POCKET, HE IS AS
[ct=2048.487] EFFICIENT AS ANYBODY AND RIGHT
[ct=2050.981] NOW, RYAN TRYING TO FIND A WAY
[ct=2052.100] TO GET HIM INTO THAT RHYTHM.
[ct=2056.549] AL: THERE HE IS.
[ct=2061.169] NOTHING LIKE CHANGING A JOB.
[ct=2062.732] YOU KEEP YOUR HOUSE AND STAY IN
[ct=2063.180] THE SAME TOWN.
[ct=2066.128] UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON.
[ct=2067.892] THE DRIVE BEGINS AT THE SIX YARD
[ct=2071.830] GOOD PROTECTION.
[ct=2071.830] THE THROW IS CAUGHT.
[ct=2072.696] KIDDO.
[ct=2075.786] I 11 YARD LINE.
[ct=2077.364] DODSON MAKING THE TACKLE THERE.
[ct=2083.014] KIRK: QUESTION TONIGHT WAS GOING
[ct=2087.895] TO BE HOW WOULD THE MIDDLE, THE
[ct=2088.500] SECOND LEVEL, THE SEE DEFENSE DO
[ct=2090.884] AGAINST KITTLE AND SAMUEL?
[ct=2092.581] YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE 49ERS LIKE
[ct=2094.645] TO RUN THE BALL AND THEN THEY
[ct=2097.396] LIKE THAT PLAY ACTION AND THE
[ct=2097.396] ROUTES.
[ct=2102.959] AT SOME POINT, YOU KNOW, THAT
[ct=2104.020] WILL BE COMING IN RIGHT BEHIND
[ct=2105.787] ZERO AND 17.
[ct=2109.443] AL: SECOND AND THREE.
[ct=2112.812] THERE HE GOES AGAIN UP TO THE 27
[ct=2117.085] YARD LINE BEHIND A BLOCK BY
[ct=2117.085] AARON BANKS.
[ct=2121.518] ALREADY TONIGHT EIGHT CARRIES,
[ct=2126.509] 65, AND HE IS DOWN AND BACK UP
[ct=2127.034] WOULD BE PATRICK TAYLOR.
[ct=2127.926] THEY HAVE ISAAC THERE AS WELL.
[ct=2136.410] HE GOES OVER TO HAVE A LOOK AS
[ct=2137.756] DOES TRENT WILLIAMS.
[ct=2144.353] THERE IS THE ROOKIE OUT OF
[ct=2144.353] LOUISVILLE.
[ct=2148.319] PICKED HIM IN THE FOURTH ROUND.
[ct=2148.319] TAYLOR IS THE OTHER BACK.
[ct=2153.998] THIS WOULD BE SERIOUS FOR THE
[ct=2161.274] 49ERS MCCAFFREY, IT IS
[ct=2162.071] UNKNOWN EXACTLY WHEN HE CAN COME
[ct=2166.319] BUT HE DOES GET UP AND IS
[ct=2168.791] ASSISTED OVER TO THE SIDELINE.
[ct=2168.791] BACK AFTER THIS.
[ct=2170.677] MASON.
[ct=2172.022] THEY WANT TO TAKE HIM BACK TO
[ct=2173.173] THE LOCKER ROOM SO HE WILL GO
[ct=2173.546] BACK THERE.
[ct=2175.439] AND WHILE, HE WILL COME IN.
[ct=2178.712] NOW FOR THE MOMENT, LEADING THE
[ct=2179.070] NFL IN RUSHING.
[ct=2181.957] HE'S GOT THE ONE EXTRA HALF GAME
[ct=2183.586] AT THIS POINT.
[ct=2185.548] MOVE AHEAD TO DERRICK HENRY AT
[ct=2186.669] LEAST FOR THE MOMENT.
[ct=2187.077] YOU HAVE THE ROOKIE OUT OF
[ct=2190.353] LOUISVILLE IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=2192.781] FIRST AND 10 FROM THE 27 YARD
[ct=2198.541] HERE HE GOES FOR A GAIN OF
[ct=2198.755] THREE.
[ct=2199.542] HE MAKES THE TACKLE.
[ct=2202.844] KAYLEE: JORDAN MASON HAS JUST
[ct=2203.863] GONE INTO THE X-RAY ROOM.
[ct=2207.028] WE ARE TOLD THE ISSUE IS HIS
[ct=2208.113] LEFT SHOULDER AND HE IS
[ct=2208.336] QUESTIONABLE TO RETURN.
[ct=2213.567] KIRK: HE THINK ABOUT CHRISTIAN
[ct=2214.821] MCCAFFREY OF COURSE, ELIJAH
[ct=2215.905] MITCHELL, DOWN TO JORDAN MASON,
[ct=2218.791] AND HE IS OUT HERE AND ALL THE
[ct=2219.395] WEIGHT COMES DOWN ON THE
[ct=2219.808] SHOULDER HE IS IN NOW.
[ct=2224.028] MAKES YOU WONDER IF DEEBO SAMUEL
[ct=2224.566] MIGHT GET A FEW MORE CARRIES
[ct=2226.217] TONIGHT, RUNNING BACK THERE.
[ct=2228.447] AL: I WOULD BET ON IT.
[ct=2233.924] FIRED OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=2238.435] BRANDON AIYUK MAKES HIS FIRST
[ct=2238.759] GRAB OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=2241.201] HIS FIRST TARGET OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=2244.699] KIRK: TALKED ABOUT THE
[ct=2246.000] LINEBACKERS WHEN YOU RUN THE
[ct=2246.691] YOU HAVE TO RESPECT IT AND GET
[ct=2250.007] DOWNHILL AND LOOK AT THE
[ct=2250.572] THROWING LANE RIGHT OVER TOP OF
[ct=2250.957] DODSON.
[ct=2254.156] WE TALKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGE ON
[ct=2254.156] THE EYES.
[ct=2256.690] LOOK AT THE RHYTHM THEY ARE OFF
[ct=2257.065] THE PLAY ACTION.
[ct=2259.257] PERFECTLY THROWN.
[ct=2264.419] AL: THAT IS SAMUEL LINING UP.
[ct=2272.365] JENNINGS TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=2276.802] THE SIGN OFF THE THROW IS CAUGHT
[ct=2280.642] AT THE 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=2281.762] AND SEVEN.
[ct=2286.016] KIRK: THE DEFENDER IS RIGHT IN
[ct=2287.207] HIS FACE AND LOWERS THE ARM
[ct=2288.654] ANGLE AND GOES RIGHT AROUND HIM.
[ct=2290.449] HE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A CHANCE
[ct=2292.057] TO GO OVER TOP OF HIM.
[ct=2293.821] PRETTY GOOD JOB BY WITHERSPOON
[ct=2295.431] DAY WHO IS MOVING AROUND HIMSELF
[ct=2297.551] TONIGHT BECAUSE OF THE INJURIES
[ct=2297.551] THAT SEATTLE HAS.
[ct=2302.393] AL: METCALF, ANOTHER HAPPY
[ct=2302.686] CAMPER AT THE MOMENT.
[ct=2305.839] PRETTY BAD.
[ct=2315.147] SAMUEL IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=2318.047] HE FLARES OUT.
[ct=2320.035] HE'S GOING TO RUN.
[ct=2322.903] HE DOES NOT GET ENOUGH CREDIT
[ct=2324.970] FOR WHAT HE DOES RUNNING TO THE
[ct=2325.184] 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=2328.107] KIRK: AS IF IT IS NOT HARD
[ct=2330.750] ENOUGH TO DEFEND KYLE SHANAHAN'S
[ct=2332.109] OFFENSE, NOW, YOU GOT TO WORRY
[ct=2332.312] ABOUT THIS?
[ct=2337.452] YOU HAVE JENNINGS AND KITTLE AND
[ct=2337.792] EVERYBODY RUNNING AROUND.
[ct=2339.362] YOU GOT EVERYBODY COVERED.
[ct=2340.723] YOU HAVE DONE YOUR JOB.
[ct=2341.975] HERE COMES 13.
[ct=2342.579] TAKE IT HOME.
[ct=2345.619] THAT IS A LOT TO DEAL WITH FOR
[ct=2348.075] ANY DEFENSE.
[ct=2349.422] YOU ARE RIGHT.
[ct=2349.721] PEOPLE DO NOT LOOK AT THAT
[ct=2351.714] ASPECT OF HIS GAME WITH HIS
[ct=2351.714] LEGS.
[ct=2352.491] HE IS A GREAT ATHLETE.
[ct=2357.089] AL: THE PLAYER BACK IN.
[ct=2366.314] THE 49ERS HAVE ALREADY GAINED
[ct=2370.281] 234 YARDS IN THIS HALF.
[ct=2373.485] KIRK: A GUY WHO IS PLAYING
[ct=2373.841] PRETTY WELL FOR THIS DEFENSE.
[ct=2378.600] HE AND DERICK HALL, BOTH KNOWN
[ct=2378.600] AS PASS RUSHERS.
[ct=2381.232] BOTH WERE QUESTIONABLE.
[ct=2384.227] BOTH ARE OUT THERE.
[ct=2385.795] FIVE SACKS ON THE YEAR FOR
[ct=2386.502] MCDONALD.
[ct=2395.237] AL: SECOND AND NINE.
[ct=2404.357] SAMUEL, DOWN THE CORNER HE GOES,
[ct=2405.709] PICKS UP ABOUT FIVE THERE.
[ct=2407.461] TRENT WILLIAMS LEADING THE WAY.
[ct=2408.549] THAT IS QUITE A CONVOY.
[ct=2412.970] KIRK: HE USED THE MOTION GOING
[ct=2413.297] THE OTHER WAY.
[ct=2416.729] IT DOES AFFECT THE EYES OF THE
[ct=2417.740] DEFENSE, TRYING TO SLOW HIM DOWN
[ct=2419.703] AND YOU HAVE WILLIAMS OUT OF THE
[ct=2420.082] CORNER.
[ct=2426.161] PRETTY GOOD JOB BY THE DEFENSE.
[ct=2427.546] STRETCHED OUT PLAY OUT TO THE
[ct=2427.900] SIDELINE.
[ct=2432.126] AL: THIRD AND FIVE.
[ct=2435.288] A LITTLE OVER FIVE MINUTES TO
[ct=2436.089] PLAY IN THE HALF.
[ct=2449.475] JENNINGS MAKING THAT -- WHAT A
[ct=2451.254] DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES.
[ct=2455.027] LAST CHRISTMAS, THEY PICK HIM
[ct=2456.857] OFF FOUR TIMES BUT A DIFFERENT
[ct=2458.039] STORY TONIGHT SO FAR.
[ct=2461.583] KIRK: DIFFERENT STORY.
[ct=2463.512] THE TIMING OF THAT THROW, HE
[ct=2465.623] DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO HAVE ONE
[ct=2466.011] MORE HITCH.
[ct=2467.247] THE BALL IS GOING TO BE THROWN
[ct=2468.354] ON THE LINE.
[ct=2469.791] LOOK AT THE ACCURACY ON THE
[ct=2470.189] THIRD DOWN THROW TO JENNINGS FOR
[ct=2471.176] THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2477.142] AL: 38 OUT OF 12.
[ct=2480.301] 142 AND A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=2488.808] THE END OF THE PLAY.
[ct=2495.719] HE WILL TELL US.
[ct=2499.213] >> PERSONAL FOUL.
[ct=2500.493] DEFENSE, NUMBER 55.
[ct=2504.916] AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2506.857] AL: THAT IS THE LINEBACKER,
[ct=2508.167] DREAMLAND JONES.
[ct=2511.761] >> RIGHT AS HE WAS MAKING THE
[ct=2514.527] INITIAL,, AGAINST -- HE GETS HIS
[ct=2518.140] LEFT HAND IN AND TAKES IT DOWN.
[ct=2519.601] REMEMBER, A BIG THING FOR SAN
[ct=2522.879] FRANCISCO HAS BEEN THEY WILL
[ct=2523.135] BUILD LEADS AND THEY DONâ€™
[ct=2523.577] BUILD LEADS AND THEY DON'T KNOW
[ct=2524.504] HOW TO FINISH.
[ct=2526.325] THEY GET INTO THE RED ZONE AND
[ct=2527.079] SETTLE FOR FIELD GOALS.
[ct=2529.282] LAST WEEK, THEY LOSE THE ARIZONA
[ct=2533.257] DID NOT CLOSE IT OFF.
[ct=2536.642] ONE OF SIX IN THE RED ZONE AS
[ct=2537.632] FAR AS TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=2538.930] LET'S SEE IF THEY CAN FINISH
[ct=2538.930] THIS DRIVE.
[ct=2542.164] AL: SAME THING HAPPENED THREE
[ct=2542.421] WEEKS AGO.
[ct=2546.163] THIS TIME, STUFFED AT THE LINE
[ct=2546.163] OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=2550.248] MENARD WILLIAMS.
[ct=2552.475] >> A BIG PART OF THAT.
[ct=2555.107] WE TALKED WITH BOTH KYLE
[ct=2556.120] SHANAHAN AND BROCK PURDY.
[ct=2557.975] HE PUT IT ON HIMSELF.
[ct=2560.625] I GOT TO BE MORE DECISIVE AND
[ct=2560.886] AGGRESSIVE.
[ct=2563.554] KYLE SHANAHAN TALKED ABOUT IF 23
[ct=2564.531] IS BACK THERE, IT IS ALWAYS A
[ct=2566.370] DIFFERENT GAME ON HOW HE
[ct=2567.036] ATTACKED IN THE RED ZONE AREA.
[ct=2569.502] THEY ARE NOT GOING
[ct=2570.775] EXCUSES.
[ct=2571.574] THEY WILL TRY AND FIND WAYS TO
[ct=2573.451] RUN THE BALL BETTER AND SUSTAIN
[ct=2573.451] BLOCKS.
[ct=2575.576] HIT THE TIGHT WINDOWS.
[ct=2583.011] >> PATRICK TAYLOR, HE IS 32.
[ct=2588.558] THE PASS FROM SAMUEL IS NO GOOD
[ct=2589.233] AND ALREADY, BURNS COVERS.
[ct=2593.700] THIRD DOWN AND 11.
[ct=2593.700] 3:16 UNTIL HALFTIME.
[ct=2599.673] >> WITH HOW THIS GAME FEELS,
[ct=2604.451] THIS IS A BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR
[ct=2606.130] SHANAHAN AND ALSO A HUGE, HUGE
[ct=2607.980] DEFENSIVE STAND HERE FOR THE
[ct=2608.696] SEAHAWKS.
[ct=2612.629] GET DOWN 20 TELL -- IT IS A
[ct=2613.006] WHOLE DIFFERENT THING.
[ct=2617.038] DOWN 16.
[ct=2620.768] AL: THIRD AND 11.
[ct=2627.264] BIG PLAY BY JEROME BAKER RIGHT
[ct=2629.848] THEY HOLD HIM TO A FIELD GOAL
[ct=2630.064] ATTEMPT.
[ct=2636.635] KIRK: HE HAS TO BEAT AARON
[ct=2636.635] BANKS.
[ct=2636.927] WATCH OUT.
[ct=2638.637] HE HAS GOT TO BEAT THIS GUY
[ct=2639.865] RIGHT HERE TO GET OUT THERE.
[ct=2642.082] FEELS IT, SEES IT.
[ct=2643.423] HE HAS GOT A WIN.
[ct=2646.092] GETS RIGHT IN FRONT OF BANKS.
[ct=2649.443] GOOD JOB OF RECOGNIZING THAT AND
[ct=2650.474] BEING ABLE TO QUICKLY GET INTO
[ct=2651.619] THE FACE OF SUPPLIER.
[ct=2655.368] AL: 35 YARD ATTEMPT FOR MATTHEW
[ct=2656.873] RIGHT.
[ct=2659.730] HE HAS BEEN GOOD TONIGHT.
[ct=2662.707] AND HE IS GOOD AGAIN.
[ct=2667.168] HE HAS MADE THREE FIELD GOALS AN
[ct=2668.830] EXTRA POINT SO FAR
[ct=2671.490] POINT.
[ct=2671.788] SO FAR, SO GOOD.
[ct=2681.387] >> HE IS IN FLORIDA.
[ct=2682.254] LIVING IN THE TAMPA AREA.
[ct=2685.435] THEY KNOW THE HURRICANE IS
[ct=2686.960] COMING IN AND THEY WERE GOING TO
[ct=2689.717] GET OUT OF THERE ANYWAY AND THEN
[ct=2690.964] GETS THE CALL FROM THE 49ERS,
[ct=2694.057] WINS THE AUDITION, AND SO FAR,
[ct=2694.386] SO GOOD TONIGHT.
[ct=2697.769] KIRK: IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A
[ct=2698.453] FRATERNITY OF GUYS LIKE THAT.
[ct=2701.517] ONE CALL AWAY IF A GUY GETS INTO
[ct=2704.098] A FUNK, THE GUY GETS INJURED AND
[ct=2706.230] THEY GET A CALL AND HE HAS TAKEN
[ct=2707.225] ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY
[ct=2707.773] WITH THREE FIELD GOALS TONIGHT.
[ct=2712.222] AL: DANCING AROUND THIS TIME,
[ct=2712.997] BRINGS IT BACK OUT TO THE 30
[ct=2716.759] KIRK: IF SEATTLE CAN GET GENO
[ct=2718.955] SMITH MIKE WE TALKED ABOUT
[ct=2718.955] INTERNET RHYTHM WHERE HE CAN GET
[ct=2722.935] STREAKY, THEY MIXED UP A LOT OF
[ct=2724.292] FORMATIONS
[ct=2725.628] GROUPINGS.
[ct=2727.051] THEY HAVE BEEN IN A LOT WITH TWO
[ct=2727.051] TIGHT ENDS.
[ct=2731.175] WITH TWO ROOKIES PLAYING IN THIS
[ct=2736.334] SECONDARY, I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT
[ct=2739.032] GO A LITTLE BIT MORE SPREAD OUT
[ct=2740.481] TO GET THE GUYS IN SPACE AND
[ct=2741.098] BEAT THEM ONE-ON-ONE IN A GOOD
[ct=2741.098] MATCHUP.
[ct=2747.220] AL: FROM THE 29.
[ct=2751.226] FOUR OUT OF NINE.
[ct=2752.488] THE HIGH SNAP RINGS IT DOWN.
[ct=2755.484] WALKER TAKES IT TO THE 33 YARD
[ct=2758.016] SECOND AND SEVEN.
[ct=2760.474] KIRK: HE WAS SACKED LAST WEEK.
[ct=2762.915] GENO SMITH WAS SEVEN TIMES.
[ct=2766.484] I DON'T KNOW IF HE IS FEELING
[ct=2769.521] THAT RUSH OR LOOKING AT THE RUSH
[ct=2770.302] INSTEAD OF KEEPING HIS EYES
[ct=2770.641] DOWNFIELD.
[ct=2774.863] DOING A GOOD JOB OF KEEPING HIM
[ct=2775.246] OFF BALANCE SO FAR.
[ct=2779.163] AL: SEATTLE TRYING TO GET
[ct=2781.544] SOMETHING GOING, TWO MINUTES
[ct=2785.529] LEFT I>> AND THERE THEY ARE.
[ct=2788.407] OURTHE HALFTIME SHOW, COMING RIG
[ct=2788.612] UP.
[ct=2791.105] KIRK: A BIG NIGHT TONIGHT.
[ct=2793.267] AL: TELL ME ABOUT IT.
[ct=2793.699] WHAT ELSE IS NEW?
[ct=2797.037] HE HAS COME BACK ONTO THE
[ct=2798.091] SIDELINE FOR THE 49ERS.
[ct=2798.702] GOOD NEWS FOR THEM.
[ct=2801.220] FIND THE OPEN MAN.
[ct=2803.905] GETS INTO THE ACTION.
[ct=2804.468] FIRST TIME TONIGHT, TAKES IT
[ct=2804.468] ACROSS.
[ct=2808.323] KIRK: NICE JOB GETTING INTO THAT
[ct=2810.742] CREASE BY JACKSON SMITH.
[ct=2813.293] THAT IS THE GUY I THINK CAN
[ct=2814.821] REALLY HAVE A NIGHT IF THEY CAN
[ct=2815.082] LOCATE HIM.
[ct=2818.339] AL: SECOND TARGET OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=2823.523] THE SEAHAWKS HAVE ALL OF THEIR
[ct=2823.873] TIMEOUTS REMAINING.
[ct=2828.870] UNDER 1.5 MINUTES HERE.
[ct=2836.218] LOOK OUT FROM BEHIND.
[ct=2840.816] GETS IT AWAY ONLY FROM A MINIMAL
[ct=2845.277] LEONARD FLOYD, WHOSE FIRST YEAR
[ct=2847.440] AS A 49ER PUT THE PRESSURE ON.
[ct=2851.208] KIRK: SAN FRANCISCO HAS BEEN
[ct=2852.306] REALLY IMPRESSED WITH HIS
[ct=2852.957] APPROACH, COMING OVER FROM
[ct=2856.272] OBVIOUSLY A GREAT PASS RUSHER.
[ct=2860.506] HE LOVES DEFENDING THE RUN, JUST
[ct=2860.830] ALL IN.
[ct=2863.574] AL: I KNOW YOU GOT ALL THREE
[ct=2865.694] TIMEOUTS HERE BUT THEY HAVE
[ct=2866.081] TAKEN THEN.
[ct=2866.683] THEY ARE NOT MOVING WITH
[ct=2868.294] ALACRITY.
[ct=2870.300] THEY ARE UNDER 50 SECONDS.
[ct=2872.949] SECOND AND NINE.
[ct=2872.949] FOUR MAN RUSH.
[ct=2877.021] GETTING FREED, KNOCKED AWAY AT
[ct=2877.625] THE LAST MOMENT.
[ct=2879.047] METCALF IS THERE.
[ct=2884.809] GEORGE ODUM REACHES TO BUST IT
[ct=2885.833] THIRD DOWN AND NINE AFTER ALL OF
[ct=2886.180] THAT.
[ct=2891.193] KIRK: I THOUGHT METCALF -- MAYBE
[ct=2892.656] WORKS BACK TO THE BALL.
[ct=2894.640] HE DEFINITELY -- THAT IS A HECK
[ct=2897.223] OF AN EFFORT TO CATCH UP TO THE
[ct=2901.369] BALL BUT IF METCALF SLOWS HIS
[ct=2901.928] BODY DOWN, IT COMES BACK TO THE
[ct=2905.128] FOOTBALL, YOU HAD TO BE A NICE
[ct=2906.001] BETTER POSITION TO TRY TO FIGHT
[ct=2906.345] FOR THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=2909.274] INSTEAD, HE JUST KIND OF WAITED
[ct=2911.402] FOR THE BALL TO COME TO HIM
[ct=2912.003] INSTEAD OF GOING AND GETTING THE
[ct=2914.456] BALL THE WAY WE SAW DEEBO SAMUEL
[ct=2914.902] DOING EARLIER.
[ct=2918.133] AL: THIRD DOWN AND NINE AND
[ct=2921.059] FINALLY, A TIMEOUT IS TAKEN BY
[ct=2924.189] TIMEOUTS ON THE SHELF.
[ct=2927.767] THEY WON HERE.
[ct=2928.468] MEANWHILE, WE CAN TELL YOU
[ct=2931.514] FAMILIES AFFECTED BY HURRICANES
[ct=2934.089] MILTON AND HE'LL LEAN URGENTLY
[ct=2934.846] NEED SUPPORT TO HELP THE
[ct=2936.542] AMERICAN RED CROSS PROVIDE MEALS
[ct=2939.020] , SHELTER THESEAFTER ALL OF THE
[ct=2940.104] THE CAROLINAS.
[ct=2940.707] >> BACK TO BACK, TOO.
[ct=2944.460] THIRD DOWN AND NINE AT THE 49
[ct=2952.120] THREE RECEIVERS SET TO THE LEFT.
[ct=2961.405] SMITH GOING AND IT GETS THE
[ct=2961.713] SIDELINE RIGHT THERE.
[ct=2966.923] CALLING IT IN.
[ct=2971.626] >> DJ METCALF OPENS UP A HUGE
[ct=2972.630] HOLD ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE
[ct=2972.936] DEFENSE.
[ct=2976.421] GREAT FOOTWORK BY SMITH BUT GOOD
[ct=2976.936] THROW THERE.
[ct=2977.958] THE TIMING TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=2980.605] WATCH DK METCALF CLEAR OUT THE
[ct=2982.130] ROOKIE, GREEN.
[ct=2984.764] HE RUNS WITH HIM AND OPENS IT UP
[ct=2986.293] NICE THROW OVER TOP FOR THE BIG
[ct=2992.417] AL: CONFIRMED BY A REPLAY IN THE
[ct=2993.477] LAST TWO MINUTES.
[ct=2993.975] 34 SECONDS.
[ct=2997.345] SMITH THROWS AND THAT IS CAUGHT.
[ct=3004.851] THAT IS GOING TO MAKE IT A
[ct=3005.062] SECOND AND ONE AND A TIMEOUT.
[ct=3008.723] KIRK: ALWAYS AMAZING.
[ct=3010.024] YOU SEE AN OFFENSE THAT IS
[ct=3010.545] STRUGGLING TO FIND THEMSELVES
[ct=3012.526] AND THEY HIT IT TO THE
[ct=3015.249] TWO-MINUTE HURRY UP AND IT JUST
[ct=3017.428] CLICKS, YOU KNOW? ONE PASS AWAY
[ct=3019.650] FROM GETTING GENO SMITH TO FEEL
[ct=3021.301] COMFORTABLE IN THE POCKET AND
[ct=3024.165] START ZONING IN AND MAKE
[ct=3024.869] ACCURATE THROWS AND THAT IS WHAT
[ct=3025.108] WE HAVE SEEN.
[ct=3032.412] â €â € DOWN TO THE 22-YARD
[ct=3033.991] â €â €LINE.
[ct=3034.318] â €â €AND WITH THESE
[ct=3035.251] â €â €RECEIVERS, YOU CAN
[ct=3035.814] â €â €ALWAYS FIND AN
[ct=3036.934] â €â €OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A
[ct=3037.834] â €â €PLAY AND GET INTO
[ct=3038.916] â €â €THAT END ZONE.
[ct=3069.471] DEREK: BRING HIM TOWARD YOU WITH
[ct=3071.689] THE SCREEN TO THE RECEIVER.
[ct=3074.114] I THINK HE GOT IN THERE QUICKER
[ct=3075.505] THAN WHAT GENO SMITH WAS
[ct=3076.342] THINKING.
[ct=3077.169] HE WAS READY FOR IT.
[ct=3092.878] OUT OF TIME-OUTS.
[ct=3103.557] AL: STARTED BACK AT THEIR OWN
[ct=3104.909] 29-YARD LINE.
[ct=3106.351] EIGHTH PLAY OF THE DRIVE.
[ct=3115.863] SMITH ON THE MOVE.
[ct=3115.863] FLAG.
[ct=3121.563] COVERAGE ON NOAH FANT BY YADIM
[ct=3123.577] AND DRAWING THE FLAG.
[ct=3125.661] AND THE SEAHAWKS ARE GOING TO BE

[ct=3134.120] REFEREE: PASS INTERFERENCE.
[ct=3135.749] DEFENSE NUMBER 22.
[ct=3138.048] PENALTY OCCURRED AT THE 1-YARD
[ct=3139.385] SEATTLE BALL.
[ct=3144.861] KIRK: THATâ€™S A CORNER ON A TIGHT
[ct=3146.768] MATCHED UP MAN-TO-MAN.
[ct=3147.826] HEâ€™S GRABBING ON TO THE OUT
[ct=3148.224] SIDE.
[ct=3150.235] HEâ€™S GOT AHOLD OF THAT JERSEY.
[ct=3155.594] NOW, THEYâ€™RE DOWN TO THE 2-YARD
[ct=3158.913] REMEMBER, NO TIME-OUTS.
[ct=3159.764] 16 SECONDS.
[ct=3161.077] QUICK DECISIONS.
[ct=3163.360] TIGHT WINDOWS HERE FOR GENO
[ct=3163.848] SMITH.
[ct=3165.676] WHO COULD WIN ONE-ON-ONE?
[ct=3167.590] WHEREâ€™S THE MATCHUP?
[ct=3180.958] AL: LOCKET WAS THE INTENDED
[ct=3181.236] SEVERE.
[ct=3182.002] LOCKET YET TO CATCH A PASS
[ct=3184.366] CORY: THE SIGN WAS GOOD.
[ct=3187.259] YOU HAVE A MAN-TO-MAN COVERAGE.
[ct=3189.043] YOU HAD TWO RECEIVERS.
[ct=3191.547] JACKSON SMITH NJIGBA AND LOCKET
[ct=3194.969] TRYING TO RUN AN OUT AND A QUICK
[ct=3194.969] SLANT.
[ct=3197.238] THE TWO DEFENDERS RAN INTO EACH
[ct=3197.522] OTHER.
[ct=3198.967] BUT THE TIMING OFF THERE WITH
[ct=3200.347] GENO AND LOCKET.
[ct=3205.569] AL: SMITH, SECOND AND GOAL.
[ct=3206.329] LEAPING UP.
[ct=3207.767] BROKEN UP.
[ct=3214.625] LENOIR COVERING ON THE PLAY.
[ct=3216.835] SMITH-NJIGBA EIGHT SECONDS.
[ct=3222.490] KIRK: WHAT A GREAT MATCHUP.
[ct=3224.703] HE LOVES THIS BE CHALLENGED WITH
[ct=3225.249] JAXON SMITH-NJIGBA.
[ct=3226.406] THE BALL IS THROWN A LITTLE BIT
[ct=3226.679] LATE.
[ct=3228.637] THATâ€™S WHY IT FELT IT WAS
[ct=3229.161] BEHIND.
[ct=3230.718] YOU CAN SEE THE LEFT-HAND OF
[ct=3236.617] LENOIR KNOCKED THAT AWAY.
[ct=3239.389] HEâ€™S TRIED LOCKETT AND JACKSON
[ct=3240.997] SMITH NJIGBA.
[ct=3247.688] -- J AXSNO SMITH-NJIGBA.
[ct=3248.278] AL: SMITH LOST IT AGAIN.
[ct=3250.069] NO GOOD, THOUGH.
[ct=3254.989] FOUR AND GOAL.
[ct=3255.383] THREE SECONDS.
[ct=3257.895] YOUâ€™VE GOT BERNARDO GREEN THE
[ct=3259.739] ROOKIE.
[ct=3260.457] REFEREE: INCOMPLETE PASS.
[ct=3266.182] KIRK: THIS IS GOING TO BE
[ct=3266.567] CLOSE.
[ct=3268.368] SURE LOOKS LIKE HEâ€™S GOING TO BE
[ct=3269.161] ONE DOWN.
[ct=3270.484] AND THEN THE SECOND -- OH, JUST
[ct=3271.641] A TOE.
[ct=3273.112] JUST A TOE.
[ct=3275.000] AL: YEP.
[ct=3277.890] CROWD SEES IT.
[ct=3279.575] THEY THINK THEREâ€™S SOME GREEN
[ct=3281.898] BETWEEN THE SHOE AND THE CHALK,
[ct=3282.421] BUT THERE ISNâ€™T.
[ct=3283.744] AND NOW THEYâ€™RE GOING TO SETTLE
[ct=3284.761] FOR A FIELD GOAL.
[ct=3285.859] AND THE CROWD DOESNâ€™T LIKE THIS
[ct=3286.233] AT ALL.
[ct=3287.591] THERE IT IS AGAIN.
[ct=3290.313] CLEARLY THE TOE COMES DOWN ON
[ct=3292.094] THE LINE.
[ct=3296.180] NOW MYERS FOR A 20-YARD ATTEMPT.
[ct=3297.919] AND THE CROWD NOT HAPPY AT ALL
[ct=3298.232] WITH THAT.
[ct=3300.745] DOWN THE FIELD THEY GO.
[ct=3301.321] THAT ENDS THE HALF.
[ct=3303.236] AT LEAST THEY GET ON THE BOARD
[ct=3305.082] TO MAKE IT A 13-POINT DEFICIT.
[ct=3311.119] 16-3, SAN FRANCISCO.
[ct=3315.360] SMITH 109 YARDS IN THE FIRST
[ct=3316.716] HALF.
[ct=3318.423] PURDY THREW FOR 139.
[ct=3319.028] 49ERS ARE GOING TO GET THE
[ct=3321.585] SECOND HALF PICKOFF.
[ct=3322.659] WE GO TO KAYLE.
[ct=3325.865] KAYLEE.
[ct=3328.026] KAY LYE: WHAT CHANGED?
[ct=3329.866] >> WE HAVE TO STICK TO THE
[ct=3330.337] PLAN.
[ct=3332.585] WE HAD A COUPLE OF
[ct=3334.082] STALLED OUT THERE
[ct=3334.497] KEEP EXECUTING THE PLAN.
[ct=3337.236] MAKE A COUPLE OF ADJUSTMENTS AT
[ct=3337.638] HALFTIME.
[ct=3338.516] WEâ€™LL BE ALL RIGHT.
[ct=3340.563] KAY LYE: YOU TOLD US PLAYING THE
[ct=3342.494] 49ERS WOULD BE A WAR OF
[ct=3343.555] ATTRITION.
[ct=3345.364] WHAT HAS THAT BEEN LIKE?
[ct=3347.213] >> THEREâ€™S A LOT OF FOOTBALL TO
[ct=3347.431] BE PLAYED.
[ct=3349.631] LETâ€™S GET BACK TO WORK.
[ct=3351.138] AL: BACK TO WORK THEY GO.
[ct=3353.570] COMING UP AFTER THE BREAK,
[ct=3355.848] "STATE FARM HALFTIME SHOW."
[ct=3371.039] TWO IN THE FIRST
[ct=3373.147] HALF AND DOWN 13, THEYâ€™RE STILL
[ct=3374.191] IN THIS GAME.
[ct=3378.044] AL: A BIG-TIME POSSESSION FOR
[ct=3381.141] ED THAT BALL FOR 18:30 AS
[ct=3383.752] OPPOSED TO 11:34,
[ct=3388.767] OPPOSED TO 11:3 FOR SEATTLE.
[ct=3390.721] GOING TO RUN IT TO THE END ZONE
[ct=3392.560] AND OUT TO THE 22, 23-YARD
[ct=3394.521] AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE
[ct=3396.569] BEFORE THEY BLOW THE WHISTLE.
[ct=3399.293] AND A FLAG IS THROWN HERE.
[ct=3403.769] ITâ€™S PATRICK TAYLOR ON THE
[ct=3404.947] RUNBACK.
[ct=3408.512] AND WEâ€™LL HEAR FROM CRAIG
[ct=3410.515] ROLSTAD.
[ct=3415.829] REFEREE: ILLEGAL FORMATION.
[ct=3418.883] SEATTLE, NUMBER 23, A FIVE-YARD
[ct=3420.204] PENALTY, END OF THE PLAY.
[ct=3422.123] FIRST DOWN SAN FRANCISCO.
[ct=3426.041] AL: MOMENTS AGO KAYLEE WITH KYLE
[ct=3430.484] KAYLEE: KYLE, YOU CONTROLLED
[ct=3432.096] TIME OF POSSESSION, BUT YOU HAD
[ct=3434.046] TO SETTLE FOR THE THREE FIELD
[ct=3434.370] GOALS.
[ct=3437.065] HOW DO YOU DO FOR THE
[ct=3437.065] TOUCHDOWN?
[ct=3438.159] >> WEâ€™VE GOT TO GET A BETTER
[ct=3439.166] DEAL ON THIRD DOWN.
[ct=3440.732] ALL THREE OF THEM WERE THIRD AND
[ct=3441.099] LONG.
[ct=3442.657] WEâ€™VE GOT TO GET MORE MANAGEABLE
[ct=3443.557] MANAGEABLE.
[ct=3443.979] WEâ€™RE THAT CLOSE ON THE SCREEN.
[ct=3447.958] THE LAST ONE WAS ONE GUY OFF.
[ct=3450.870] KAYLEE: WE SAW JORDAN MASON GO
[ct=3452.527] INTO THE X RAY ROOM?
[ct=3454.900] >> HEâ€™LL HEâ€™S GOOD TO GO.
[ct=3458.074] HEâ€™LL START AWE US OFF HERE.
[ct=3459.564] AL: INDEED, HE IS.
[ct=3462.551] MASON HAS NOW CARRIED NINE TIMES
[ct=3463.465] FOR 73 YARDS.
[ct=3466.030] HEâ€™S AVERAGING EIGHT YARDS PER
[ct=3467.458] TOTAL
[ct=3468.432] KIRK: BOY, ITâ€™S FUN TO WATCH HIM
[ct=3469.407] RUN THAT OUTSIDE ZONE PLAY.
[ct=3471.669] ITâ€™S A STAPLE WITH KYLE
[ct=3473.265] WEâ€™VE SEEN IT RUN TONIGHT.
[ct=3475.025] WEâ€™VE SEEN IT BOUNCE OUTSIDE
[ct=3476.428] WHERE THEYâ€™RE ABLE TO SET THAT
[ct=3477.805] EDGE WITH THAT DOUBLE-TEAM.
[ct=3478.716] AND IT BOUNCES.
[ct=3481.359] WEâ€™VE SEEN IT CUT BACK BEHIND
[ct=3481.705] THAT CENTER BLOCK.
[ct=3484.236] ITâ€™S THE ONE THING THAT MIKE
[ct=3486.783] MCDONALD TOLD US THAT THE PACK
[ct=3488.691] SIDE HAS GOT TO BE REALLY BE
[ct=3489.293] READY TO GO
[ct=3491.497] THAT TIME THEY BOUNCED IT OFF
[ct=3493.232] WIDE.
[ct=3495.937] AL: GUERENDO COMES IN AND HEâ€™LL
[ct=3496.270] PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN AFTER THE
[ct=3497.324] 42-YARD LINE.
[ct=3499.581] JULIAN LOVE COMES UP TO STOP
[ct=3502.086] 49ERS PICK UP THE INITIAL FIRST
[ct=3502.774] DOWN OF THE HALF.
[ct=3505.398] THERE IS WORK ON THAT SHOULDER.
[ct=3508.027] HE INJURED THAT ONE IN THE FIRST
[ct=3510.358] KIRK: YOU KNOW, HEâ€™S SUCH A
[ct=3511.215] PHYSICAL GUY.
[ct=3512.647] ITâ€™S HARD TO CHANGE HIS RUNNING
[ct=3514.969] STYLE.
[ct=3516.049] HEâ€™S GOT TO USE THOSE BIG
[ct=3518.173] SHOULDERS TO RUN THROUGH THOSE
[ct=3519.241] LINEBACKERS.
[ct=3528.528] AL: THEREâ€™S DEEBO SAMUEL.
[ct=3528.924] HE GOES IN MOTION.
[ct=3531.452] PURDY PROTECTED WELL.
[ct=3531.841] FIERS
[ct=3535.931] FIFIRES A LITTLE BIT SHORT.
[ct=3539.609] KIRK: BROWN HAD A COUPLE OF
[ct=3541.125] PENALTIES AGAINST THE GIANTS
[ct=3542.173] LAST WEEK.
[ct=3547.906] TOP ON AIYUK.
[ct=3557.444] REFEREE: THEREâ€™S NO FOUL ON THE

[ct=3572.482] KIRK: HE MUST BE A GREAT --
[ct=3572.765] GREAT MITT GATOR.
[ct=3580.615] HE MADE A -- MI TIGATOR BECAUSE

[ct=3594.197] GUERENDO STAYS IN.
[ct=3600.565] PURDY DEEP DROP.
[ct=3603.681] OPEN.
[ct=3604.689] KITTLE DOWN THE SIDELINE.
[ct=3607.006] HE GOES BOUNCING OFF THE
[ct=3611.072] AND ANOTHER BIG PLAY WITH Kâ€™VON
[ct=3612.739] WALLACE MAKING THE STOP THERE.
[ct=3617.312] SO ON A SECOND AND 10, THEY GO
[ct=3617.312] 29 YARDS.
[ct=3620.582] AND INSIDE SEA HAWK TERRITORY,
[ct=3621.975] THE BALL AT THE 29-YARD LINE.
[ct=3625.425] KIRK: JUST A LITTLE HESITATION.
[ct=3627.305] CORNER FOR SAMUEL.
[ct=3629.613] NOBODY PICKS UP THE BIG FELLOW
[ct=3631.275] 85 WHO SNEAKS DOWN THAT LEFT
[ct=3633.616] PURDY LOOKS OFF TO SAFETY.
[ct=3639.047] NOBODY OUT IN THAT LEFT SIDE.
[ct=3640.348] BIG GAIN.
[ct=3644.574] AL: BACK TO THE GROUND.
[ct=3645.832] GUERENDO.
[ct=3649.625] GETS AWAY FROM THE FIRST MAN.
[ct=3653.755] A STOP THERE BY JULIAN LOVE.
[ct=3657.264] GUERENDO HAS CARRIED SIX TIMES
[ct=3658.268] FOR 15.
[ct=3663.505] KIRK: WE WERE TALKING EARLIER
[ct=3665.738] ABOUT HOW TO GO BACK TO THE MIKE
[ct=3667.658] SHANAHAN ERA AND THE ZONE PLAY
[ct=3669.585] IN DENVER AND OBVIOUSLY WITH
[ct=3671.478] KYLE SHANAHAN PEOPLE WERE ALMOST
[ct=3673.073] LIKE IT DOESNâ€™T EVEN MATTER WHO
[ct=3675.740] THE RUNNING BACK IS OR WHO THE
[ct=3677.240] QUARTERBACK IS.
[ct=3680.330] IT DOES.
[ct=3681.126] THOSE COACHES FIND GUYS WHO FIT
[ct=3683.167] THEIR SYSTEMS AND IT ALL FITS
[ct=3684.921] TOGETHER LIKE A PULLS.
[ct=3685.819] BUT YOUâ€™VE GOT TO GIVE THEM
[ct=3686.541] CREDIT BOTH THE PLAYER AND THE
[ct=3687.836] COACH.
[ct=3690.666] AL: TIME AFTER TIME, SOMETHING
[ct=3692.694] IN THAT SHANAHAN FAMILY BLOOD.
[ct=3694.958] MEANWHILE, HERE GOES GUERENDO.
[ct=3696.896] SOME TOUGH RUNG.
[ct=3698.490] AND GUERENDO WILL PICK UP A
[ct=3701.219] FIRST DOWN ON THE 17-YARD LINE.
[ct=3701.887] KIRK: REMEMBER, HOW WE TALKED
[ct=3703.431] ABOUT THIS PLAY CAN GO FROM THE
[ct=3704.934] OUTSIDE OR COME BACK TO THE
[ct=3705.283] INSIDE?
[ct=3707.305] THEYâ€™RE GOING TO CUT BACK ON THE
[ct=3708.240] NOSE GUARDS.
[ct=3709.509] HEâ€™S LOOKING TO THE LEFT.
[ct=3710.895] LOOKING OUTSIDE.
[ct=3713.716] OUTSIDE, THAT HOLE IS OPENING
[ct=3715.513] RIGHT BACK THIS WAY.
[ct=3716.215] SO GOOD VISION THIS TIME.
[ct=3718.409] INSTEAD OF BALANCING IT.
[ct=3720.026] SEATTLE IS NOT LEGISLATE IT GET
[ct=3721.363] OUTSIDE.
[ct=3722.125] HE WAS PATIENT.
[ct=3724.901] AND THEN HE GETS OFF THE FIELD
[ct=3726.563] THERE AND READ THAT SEAM
[ct=3729.006] PERFECTLY.
[ct=3730.821] AL: A LOT OF EYE CANDY.
[ct=3732.827] AND TO THE 10-YARD LINE GOES
[ct=3734.616] PATRICK TAYLOR.
[ct=3736.619] ONE OF THE BACKUP BACKS OUT OF
[ct=3738.379] MEMPHIS.
[ct=3738.625] HE WAS A FREE AGENT.
[ct=3741.453] HAD NO TOUCHES THIS SEASON UNTIL
[ct=3741.453] NOW.
[ct=3744.164] MAINLY A SPECIAL TEAMS GUY.
[ct=3751.674] KIRK: HE TOLD US THEYâ€™VE GOT
[ct=3752.607] LEARN HOW TO FINISH.
[ct=3753.603] UP 16-3.
[ct=3756.345] IT WOULD BE EASY TO SAY WEâ€™VE
[ct=3758.169] GOT THIS GAME IN HAND.
[ct=3760.920] HEâ€™S SAYING WEâ€™RE GOING RIGHT
[ct=3762.865] DOWN THE FIELD AND WEâ€™RE PUTTING
[ct=3763.403] SIX ON THE BOARD.
[ct=3765.270] AL: TRYING TO FINISH IT OFF.
[ct=3767.651] LIMITED TO ONE TOUCHDOWN AND
[ct=3769.274] THREE FIELD GOALS.
[ct=3772.596] AND THIS TIME, STUFFED AFTER A
[ct=3774.182] MINIMAL GAME IS TAYLOR.
[ct=3777.434] LEONARD WILLIAMS HAS TO GET BY.
[ct=3778.024] NUMBER 99.
[ct=3782.233] BIG THIRD UP AND 3 UPCOMING.
[ct=3783.929] KIRK: I WOULD GO BACK TO THAT
[ct=3784.678] ZONE PLAY.
[ct=3785.983] GREAT DEFENSE.
[ct=3787.308] LEONARD WILLIAMS SUCH A FORCE IN
[ct=3787.699] THAT FRONT.
[ct=3789.472] HERE WE GO, RED ZONE.
[ct=3792.017] THEYâ€™RE GOING TO SETTLE FOR
[ct=3795.086] FIELD GOALS, THEY GOING TO SCORE
[ct=3796.739] TOUCHDOWNS?
[ct=3799.195] AL: THE 49ERS HAVE RUN THE BALL
[ct=3800.831] 24 TIMES TONIGHT.
[ct=3803.807] ONLY 16 PASS PLAYS.
[ct=3805.508] THIRD AND 3.
[ct=3809.217] KIRK: AND BUNCH SET UP TO THE
[ct=3810.686] MOTION IT OUT.
[ct=3815.164] AL: PURDY THROWS.
[ct=3817.023] AND RIGHT AT THE PYLON.
[ct=3819.954] TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=3821.904] KITTLE MAKES THE CATCH RIGHT AT
[ct=3823.193] THE PYLON.
[ct=3825.059] BIG SPINAL AND THIS TIME THE
[ct=3827.958] 49ERS -- BIG SPIKE.
[ct=3830.298] AND THIS TIME THE 49ERS PAY
[ct=3832.332] KIRK: THEY CAME BACK WITH
[ct=3833.902] JENNINGS TO CREATE THAT
[ct=3836.574] CONFUSION WITH THAT BUNCH WITH
[ct=3836.574] THREE RECEIVERS.
[ct=3838.013] WHAT A THROW.
[ct=3838.862] AND HOW ABOUT KITTLE?
[ct=3843.528] THE ATHLETIC ABILITY TO GET BOTH
[ct=3846.138] HIS FEET DOWN, JUST COMPLETELY
[ct=3848.199] PERFECT EXECUTION, THROW, CATCH
[ct=3849.770] AND THE FEET FOR THE TOUCHDOWN
[ct=3852.210] IN THAT RED ZONE AREA.
[ct=3853.927] THAT TIME THEY WERE ABLE TO
[ct=3854.796] SCORE THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=3856.856] AL: HEREâ€™S WRIGHT.
[ct=3860.598] HEâ€™S BEEN PERFECT FOR FIELD
[ct=3861.867] GOALS AND A COUPLE OF EXTRA
[ct=3862.385] POINTS.
[ct=3864.002] AND THE 49ERS IN A BIG GAME FOR
[ct=3865.179] BOTH TEAMS ON TOP 23-3.
[ct=3870.995] ABOUT A GUY WHO KNOWS WHERE
[ct=3871.697] THE SKYCAM IS, WHERE THE
[ct=3872.558] HANDHELD IS.
[ct=3876.686] KIRK: HE LIKES TO HAVE FUN AND
[ct=3877.536] DOMINATE AT THE SAME TIME.
[ct=3879.288] AL: MEANWHILE BREAKING
[ct=3882.926] TACKLES AND HE BREAKS FREE!
[ct=3887.398] EXACTLY WHAT THE SEAHAWKS NEEDED
[ct=3891.756] , AND FOR THE TOUCHDOWN, 97
[ct=3894.200] YARDS!
[ct=3902.769] IF EVER THEY NEEDED A SPARK,
[ct=3903.601] THIS WAS THE MOMENT FOR THE
[ct=3910.961] DOWN BY 20, HE HAD FUMBLED AWAY
[ct=3913.318] A KICK EARLIER, HE TAKES IT FROM
[ct=3913.635] THE THREE ALL THE WAY.
[ct=3929.285] ONLY THE SECOND KICKOFF
[ct=3931.307] TOUCHDOWN IN THE LEAGUE THIS
[ct=3936.879] JASON MYERS WITH THE EXTRA POINT
[ct=3940.351] AND WHEN THINGS WERE VERY SOMBER
[ct=3941.292] AROUND HERE, ALL OF A SUDDEN
[ct=3942.293] BACK TO LIFE.
[ct=3942.825] KIRK: WHAT A PLAY.
[ct=3946.793] ANYTIME YOU HAVE A BIG RETURN,
[ct=3947.751] YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE FIRST GUY
[ct=3949.506] MISS.
[ct=3951.041] THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE DOES
[ct=3951.835] BEING ABLE TO AVOID THIS MAN
[ct=3954.939] AVOID HIM, BOUNCE OFF OF ANOTHER
[ct=3959.553] GUY, THE BIG LINEBACKER GRAHAM,
[ct=3962.137] AND THEN IT IS A FOOT RACE.
[ct=3963.289] HE MAKES THE FIRST GUY MISS.
[ct=3964.077] THAT WAS MAHONEY.
[ct=3966.532] HE BOUNCES OFF.
[ct=3970.214] THEN HE LOOKS AROUND AND THEREâ€™
[ct=3970.497] THEN HE LOOKS AROUND AND THERE'S
[ct=3970.830] NO ONE THERE.
[ct=3972.098] FINALLY WITH THE NEW RULES
[ct=3974.945] CHANGES, WE ARE EXCITED TO SEE
[ct=3975.804] THESE KICKOFF RETURNS.
[ct=3979.661] AL HAS BEEN FRUSTRATED EVERY
[ct=3983.557] SINGLE WEEK.
[ct=3983.557] AND THERE IS A RETURN FOR YOU.
[ct=3985.665] AL:AL: I WILL TELL YOU ANOTHER
[ct=3988.527] GUY, THE SPECIAL TEAMS
[ct=3989.382] COORDINATOR FOR THE SEATTLE
[ct=3991.814] SPEAKING OF THE HARBAUGH FAMILY.
[ct=3994.812] KIRK: HE IS FIRED UP.
[ct=3995.677] GOOD CALL, COACH.
[ct=3998.897] GETS THE HAWKS RIGHT BACK IN THE
[ct=4008.417] SHENAULT, BIG, PHYSICAL
[ct=4008.417] RECEIVER.
[ct=4010.491] POUNCING OFF OF THAT WOULD BE
[ct=4010.931] TACKLE.
[ct=4013.162] HE'S TIRED.
[ct=4013.463] [LAUGHTER]
[ct=4017.306] AL: WE JUST SAW J HARBAUGH,
[ct=4017.766] JIM'S SON.
[ct=4022.771] THE KID GETS A BREAK.
[ct=4027.210] HE WILL BE AS HAPPY AS ANYBODY
[ct=4027.839] IN THE BALLPARK.
[ct=4030.750] THAT GETS HIS TEAM RIGHT BACK IN
[ct=4030.750] THE GAME.
[ct=4033.792] THE 49ERS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY
[ct=4036.227] TO RUN THIS ONE BACK.
[ct=4038.116] DEEBO SAMUEL TAKES IT TO THE
[ct=4040.210] 31-YARD LINE TO BEGIN THE NEXT
[ct=4040.557] DRIVE.
[ct=4045.335] ONCE AGAIN, THE STANDINGS NOW IN
[ct=4048.009] THE NFC WEST, GOING INTO THE
[ct=4049.103] SEASON IT LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD
[ct=4050.534] BE THE TOUGHEST IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=4052.297] WHO KNOWS AT THIS POINT.
[ct=4057.244] IF SEATTLE WERE TO WIN THE GAME,
[ct=4060.312] SAN FRANCISCO WOULD BE ALREADY
[ct=4061.339] TWO GAMES BACK AND 0-3 IN THE
[ct=4061.339] DIVISION.
[ct=4064.668] BIG GAME FOR SEATTLE BUT I THINK
[ct=4066.531] A BIGGER GAME FOR SAN FRANCISCO.
[ct=4070.715] KIRK: I THINK THAT'S WHY SAN
[ct=4071.577] FRANCISCO HAS COME OUT WITH A
[ct=4073.388] SENSE OF URGENCY ON A SHORT
[ct=4073.913] WEEK.
[ct=4076.872] AL: PATRICK TAYLOR IS THE BACK.
[ct=4078.584] THROW IT TO HIM.
[ct=4082.466] TAYLOR.
[ct=4082.466] 12 YARD GAIN.
[ct=4089.311] KIRK: TAYLOR, FOURTH-YEAR OUT OF
[ct=4089.935] EVERYTHING TAKEN DOWNFIELD AWAY.
[ct=4095.351] JUST BEING PATIENT.
[ct=4096.870] NO REASON TO GET THE BALL FORCED
[ct=4098.934] LINEBACKERS CLEARING OUT.
[ct=4100.955] NO PROBLEM.
[ct=4103.040] AND LOOK AT THIS, BANG.
[ct=4104.979] LOWER TO SHOULDER.
[ct=4106.471] HE'S ANOTHER BIG, 220 POUNDER.
[ct=4108.434] NOT BASHFUL THERE.
[ct=4113.601] AL: STILL TRYING TO CIRCULATE
[ct=4114.935] THAT SHOULDER TRYING TO GET BACK
[ct=4115.265] IN THE GAME.
[ct=4121.020] MADE THE ONE PLAY IN THE SECOND
[ct=4122.226] NONE SINCE.
[ct=4123.273] AGAIN.
[ct=4130.674] GUERENDO PICKS UP A COUPLE.
[ct=4132.490] SECOND DOWN AND EIGHT.
[ct=4134.612] KIRK:KIRK: GOOD HUSTLE FROM
[ct=4135.039] JARRAN REED.
[ct=4139.782] CATCHING SOME OXYGEN.
[ct=4141.449] THAT BACKSIDE HAS TO CHASE AND
[ct=4143.950] MAKE SURE HE DOES NOT HAVE THAT
[ct=4144.483] CUT BACK LANE.
[ct=4147.400] THE BIG FELLA, 300 POUNDER
[ct=4147.807] HUSTLING DOWN THE LINE OF
[ct=4150.606] SCRIMMAGE TO MAKE THE TACKLE.
[ct=4157.848] AL: 8:30 LEFT IN THE THIRD.
[ct=4165.362] PURDY AVOIDS THE SACK, THROWS
[ct=4170.154] AND FINDS I UKE --
[ct=4174.255] FREE.
[ct=4178.898] >> HOLDING, OFFENSE NUMBER 64.
[ct=4186.442] KIRK:KIRK: THEY ARE HAVING A
[ct=4187.157] HARD TIME GETTING PRESSURE ON
[ct=4193.057] THE LINEBACKER DOTSON, THE
[ct=4195.002] CENTER 64, GETS HIS ARMS WRAPPED
[ct=4195.923] AROUND AND PULLS HIM DOWN.
[ct=4197.599] GOOD CALL BY THE OFFICIAL.
[ct=4202.134] TAKES AWAY AGAIN BY THE 49ERS.
[ct=4206.957] AL: MAKES IT SECOND AND 18.
[ct=4212.649] KIRK:KIRK: THE FIRST TIME THIS
[ct=4213.614] CROWD HAS REALLY COME ALIVE
[ct=4213.614] SINCE EARLY IN THE GAME.
[ct=4226.870] AL: SECOND AND 18TH FROM THE 35.
[ct=4232.051] SETS, FIRES, AND IT IS UP AT THE
[ct=4232.747] 38 YARD LINE.
[ct=4233.453] JAJUAN JENNINGS WITH THE
[ct=4233.895] SEAHAWKS WILL TAKE THAT.
[ct=4237.329] ONLY A TWO YARD GAIN.
[ct=4240.050] KIRK: I THINK KYLE SHANAHAN
[ct=4241.496] LIKES THE MOBILITY.
[ct=4245.465] WE HAVE A MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE
[ct=4246.305] TREY BROWN IS LIMPING OFF.
[ct=4248.561] ALREADY SOME INJURIES IN THE
[ct=4248.796] SECONDARY.
[ct=4261.652] AT THE SAME TIME HE DOES NOT
[ct=4262.118] WANT TO BE ALWAYS RELYING UPON
[ct=4262.642] TRYING TO CREATE TOO MUCH.
[ct=4265.423] AL: NEHEMIAH CHRISTIAN IS A
[ct=4267.733] ROOKIE FROM AUBURN, FIFTH ROUND
[ct=4267.733] PICK.
[ct=4271.161] >> AT THE REPLAY ASSIST, THE
[ct=4271.777] LAST PASS WAS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=4274.467] THEREFORE THE BALL WILL BE ON
[ct=4275.311] THE 35 YARD LINE.
[ct=4279.553] AL: ALL RIGHT, NO BIG DEAL, IT
[ct=4280.461] MAKES IT THIRD AND 18 INSTEAD OF
[ct=4282.675] THIRD AND 16.
[ct=4285.416] KIRK: IT HELPS WITH THE CLOCK IF
[ct=4290.137] YOU ARE SEATTLE.
[ct=4295.933] SO YOU HAVE A ROOKIE LINED UP.
[ct=4296.936] HE WAS ON THE RIGHT.
[ct=4299.076] HE'S NOW MOVING FOR NOW OFF TO
[ct=4301.298] THE LEFT.
[ct=4301.858] BROCK PURDY'S LEFT.
[ct=4311.971] AL: SETS UP TO FACE JENNINGS.
[ct=4315.395] MEANWHILE, THERE IS SAMUEL STILL
[ct=4315.737] FINDING HIS WAY.
[ct=4319.987] TURNS IT INTO A BIGGER GAIN.
[ct=4323.812] FOURTH DOWN AND 4
[ct=4328.625] KIRK: THE ROOKIE, HE DID NOT GET
[ct=4329.798] INVOLVED BUT HE HAD TO MAKE THAT
[ct=4333.658] DEEBO SAMUEL IS TOUGH TO BRING
[ct=4337.311] TRYING TO AFFECT FIELD POSITION
[ct=4340.939] IF NOTHING ELSE, PINNING GENO
[ct=4342.290] SMITH BACK.
[ct=4347.746] AL: SECOND PUNT.
[ct=4349.238] HIS FIRST WAS 44.
[ct=4356.885] THAT'SMES TO THE START, YOU
[ct=4358.016] HAVE TO DEAL WITH NICK BOSA.
[ct=4359.697] HE IS AS QUICK AS ANYBODY ON THE
[ct=4362.791] DEFENSIVE LINE, AVERAGES THE
[ct=4364.981] FASTEST GET OFF AT .67.
[ct=4367.618] HE IS FIRED UP TONIGHT GOING UP
[ct=4369.455] AGAINST STONE, FORSYTH.
[ct=4373.033] SIX PRESSURES, THE MOST HE'S HAD
[ct=4375.010] IN A FIRST HALF ALL YEAR.
[ct=4375.916] LET'S SEE WHAT HEâ€™S DONE AT THE
[ct=4377.065] TOP HERE ON THE EDGE.
[ct=4381.752] AL: JOEY BOSA, HIS BROTHER, NO
[ct=4382.216] SLOUCH EITHER.
[ct=4386.833] THAT IS AT THAT 19 YARD LINE BY
[ct=4387.082] AJ BARNER.
[ct=4397.446] KIRK:KIRK: AJ BARNER IS A
[ct=4397.686] GOOD-LOOKING PROSPECT, ROOKIE
[ct=4398.361] OUT OF MICHIGAN.
[ct=4398.361] 6'6", 250.
[ct=4411.864] AL: SMITH AT 10 OF 19 FOR 122.
[ct=4413.109] TACKLE BY ODOM.
[ct=4414.339] SECOND AND 8.
[ct=4419.140] KIRK: WE ARE AT THAT POINT IN
[ct=4420.799] THE GAME WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO
[ct=4422.248] CONTINUE TO BE ONE-DIMENSIONAL
[ct=4423.852] JUST THROWING THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=4424.761] I DO THINK THEIR BEST
[ct=4427.539] OPPORTUNITY IS FINDING THE HOLES
[ct=4429.363] BETWEEN THE BACKERS AND
[ct=4431.180] DEFENSIVE BACKS AND SETTLING IN.
[ct=4434.271] LOCKET HAS HAD A QUIET NIGHT.
[ct=4438.559] ALWAYS CAPABLE OF MAKING BIG
[ct=4439.184] PLAYS.
[ct=4440.086] METCALF CURRENTLY NOT IN THE
[ct=4447.326] AL: PLAY-ACTION.
[ct=4451.257] THE PRESSURE IS PUT ON.
[ct=4457.004] THAT TIME IT WAS NICK BOSA, WHO
[ct=4457.513] ELSE?
[ct=4457.990] HE COMES STORMING IN.
[ct=4462.509] KIRK: IT IS JUST ABOUT AFFECTING
[ct=4462.509] THE QUARTERBACK.
[ct=4464.646] THERE IS THAT STANCE, ALMOST
[ct=4465.228] LOOK LIKE HE HAS LINED UP
[ct=4465.228] OFFSIDES.
[ct=4467.857] THAT WAS REALLY CLOSE.
[ct=4470.835] HE GOES RIGHT AROUND TO FORCE
[ct=4472.571] GENO SMITH TO STEP UP AND OUT.
[ct=4476.437] IMPACTING THE PLAY.
[ct=4480.634] AL: THIRD AND 8.
[ct=4485.034] THIRD DOWN BACK, CHARBONNET IS
[ct=4485.427] IN.
[ct=4488.875] THEY SPLIT HIM WIDE TO THE
[ct=4490.857] FIVE WIDE HERE.
[ct=4496.174] LOOKING THAT WAY, THROWING THAT
[ct=4497.437] WAY, IT IS THERE!
[ct=4500.964] YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT WHAT A
[ct=4502.268] QUIET NIGHT, BUT HE'S BEEN DOING
[ct=4503.437] THESE THINGS FOR 10 YEARS.
[ct=4507.414] TYLER LOCKETT.
[ct=4511.051] KIRK: THE TIGHT END TO THE LEFT,
[ct=4512.370] THE BACK TO THE RIGHT, THEY WANT
[ct=4515.562] TO CREATE SPACE AND CREATE
[ct=4516.475] VERTICAL OPPORTUNITIES AND THAT
[ct=4516.924] IS WHAT THEY HAVE RIGHT HERE.
[ct=4520.392] GOOD MATCHUP, SMART BY GENO
[ct=4521.726] SMITH TO THROW IT AND HE HITS A
[ct=4522.447] HUGE ONE FOR SEATTLE.
[ct=4524.282] AL: 39
[ct=4528.260] GAIN OF ABOUT FIVE THAT TIME BY
[ct=4528.466] CHARBONNET.
[ct=4531.398] SECOND AND5.
[ct=4534.014] KIRK: THE OFFENSIVE LINE GIVE
[ct=4536.587] HIM JUST ENOUGH TIME.
[ct=4536.852] HE KNEW WHERE HE WANTED TO GO
[ct=4537.054] WHEN HE SPREAD HIM OUT.
[ct=4541.724] AL: MEANWHILE, LOCKETT JUST CAME
[ct=4542.627] OUT, HE GOES TO THE SIDELINE
[ct=4544.527] AFTER THAT.
[ct=4546.754] SECOND DOWN AND SIX.
[ct=4549.672] PLAY FAKE, FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4552.959] MORE TO THE 25 YARD LINE.
[ct=4556.861] KAYLEE: RIGHT NOW THAT 49ERS
[ct=4557.609] SECONDARY DOES NOT HAVE THE
[ct=4559.260] ROOKIE MALIK MUSTAPHA IN THE
[ct=4562.491] HE JUMPED OUT OF THE GAME WITH
[ct=4563.267] THAT INTERCEPTION ON GENO SMITH
[ct=4563.692] EARLY.
[ct=4567.119] BUT THE GAME IS OVER FOR HIM.
[ct=4568.212] HE INJURED HIS ANKLE LATE IN THE
[ct=4568.991] SECOND QUARTER AND HE HAS BEEN
[ct=4569.515] RULED OUT.
[ct=4573.006] AL: OH BOY.
[ct=4574.266] GEORGE ODUM WILL TAKE HIS PLACE,
[ct=4575.568] NUMBER 30 COMES IN.
[ct=4581.080] MINUS TRAVERSO WARD TO BEGIN
[ct=4582.460] WITH.
[ct=4587.105] SO THEY ARE REALLY DEPLETED BACK
[ct=4590.026] SMITH SETS UP THE SCREEN.
[ct=4592.654] TO THE FAKE, CAUGHT BY WALKER.
[ct=4596.823] GAIN OF ABOUT EIGHT INSIDE THE
[ct=4597.179] 20 YARD LINE.
[ct=4600.432] KIRK: THIS IS THE SEATTLE
[ct=4601.111] OFFENSE I THINK WE EXPECTED TO
[ct=4606.010] SEE, MUCH QUICKER BALL OUT OF
[ct=4606.299] THE HANDS OF GENO SMITH.
[ct=4614.113] AL: SECOND AND 2.
[ct=4616.277] WALKER CANNOT GET AROUND THE
[ct=4621.733] BROWN STOPPING HIM.
[ct=4628.275] LOSS OF ONE THIRD AND 3 FOR
[ct=4631.056] KIRK: THE NEW DEFENSIVE
[ct=4633.937] COORDINATOR, THEIR FOURTH IN
[ct=4634.190] FIVE YEARS FOR KYLE SHANAHAN.
[ct=4637.065] AL:AL: AS GOOD AS THE DEFENSE
[ct=4637.500] HAS BEEN.
[ct=4640.947] A COUPLE HAVE GONE TO
[ct=4644.124] HEAD-COACHING POSITIONS LIKE
[ct=4644.717] ROBERT SALEH AND DEMECO RYANS.
[ct=4647.674] AND THAT PASSING WILL BE CAUGHT
[ct=4648.086] FOR A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4651.810] DK METCALF COVERED BY GREENE,
[ct=4653.221] THE ROOKIE.
[ct=4655.297] KIRK: GREAT ROUTE AGAINST CHRIS
[ct=4660.116] WHAT HIM GIVE THE INSIDE MOVE TO
[ct=4663.618] THE SLANT, TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=4665.056] HE SAW THE MATCHUP AGAINST THE
[ct=4665.699] ROOKIE AND TOOK IT.
[ct=4670.097] AL: WALKER TO THE THREE YARD
[ct=4675.222] YOU CAN'T GET A FIRST DOWN
[ct=4675.594] WITHOUT A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=4677.223] IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND 2.
[ct=4679.915] KIRK:KIRK: LEFT TACKLE THAT
[ct=4679.915] TIME.
[ct=4683.910] FROM THE OUTSIDE TO THE INSIDE.
[ct=4692.231] AL: MEANWHILE, LOCKETT HAS GONE
[ct=4692.509] BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM.
[ct=4693.700] WALKER TRIES TO BACK HIS WAY
[ct=4696.756] STOPS SHORT BUT THEY PICK UP A
[ct=4701.510] IN ALL LIKELIHOOD.
[ct=4701.821] FIRST AND GOAL.
[ct=4704.850] KIRK: THIS KID IS POWERFUL, LOW
[ct=4708.553] CENTER OF GRAVITY.
[ct=4709.750] HE WILL DRIVE AND PUSH.
[ct=4710.172] IF YOU THINK YOU CAN BRING HIM
[ct=4710.402] DOWN WITH ONE GUY, YOU WILL NOT
[ct=4710.811] BE ABLE TO.
[ct=4714.410] AL: SMITH.
[ct=4714.410] CAN HE GET IN?
[ct=4716.835] TRIES TO BURROW HIS WAY IN.
[ct=4721.728] KIRK: I THINK FRED WARNER WENT
[ct=4724.077] OVER THE TOP TO KEEP HIM OUT.
[ct=4726.697] PERFECTLY TIMED UP BY 54.
[ct=4728.674] AL: HERE IS BOTH SO.
[ct=4734.632] -- BOTH SAW.
[ct=4741.429] SECOND DOWN AND GOAL WITH 1:50,
[ct=4742.620] THE DRIVE 93 YARDS.
[ct=4744.305] KIRK: SOME CONFUSION.
[ct=4746.101] AL: RUNNING AROUND.
[ct=4748.875] KIRK: GOT 12 GUYS OUT THERE.
[ct=4751.649] AL: THE OFFICIALS HAD TO LET
[ct=4752.153] THEM MAKE THE SUBSTITUTION.
[ct=4753.534] THE CROWD DOESN'T LIKE IT.
[ct=4756.402] ENABLES THEM TO GET THE RIGHT
[ct=4756.878] PERSONNEL IN.
[ct=4759.316] STILL RUNNING AROUND.
[ct=4759.694] STILL MOTIONING.
[ct=4762.433] MEANWHILE WALKER GOES TO THE END
[ct=4762.806] ZONE FOR THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=4771.353] KENNETH WALKER INTO THE END
[ct=4771.636] ZONE.
[ct=4777.423] AND THE SEAHAWKS WHO WERE DOWN
[ct=4782.762] BY 20 CAN MAKE IT SIX WITH THE
[ct=4783.073] EXTRA POINT.
[ct=4786.120] KIRK: GO BACK TO THE KICK
[ct=4787.152] RETURN.
[ct=4789.920] THIS STADIUM WAS FLAT.
[ct=4790.775] THE GAME FELT LIKE THE NINERS
[ct=4791.388] DID WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO.
[ct=4796.006] THEY GO DOWN AND SCORE A
[ct=4798.397] TOUCHDOWN, UP CONVINCINGLY AND
[ct=4798.678] IT LOOKS LIKE THE GAME WILL BE
[ct=4799.096] OVER.
[ct=4801.582] BUT NOW THEY HAVE WALKED IT ALL
[ct=4802.630] THE WAY BACK AFTER THAT RETURN.
[ct=4808.262] AL: THE KICK IS GOOD OFF THE
[ct=4810.968] FOOT OF JASON MYERS.
[ct=4812.664] WE TOLD YOU BE ON THE OTHER
[ct=4812.901] SIDE OF THAT MOON.
[ct=4815.650] KIRK: I THINK THAT'S OUR FIRST
[ct=4820.560] OFFICIAL CODE ON A GRAPHIC TO
[ct=4820.960] PROMOTE A GAME.
[ct=4823.923] QUITE A STORY NEXT WEEK.
[ct=4835.217] AL: A RESOUNDING ACKNOWLEDGMENT
[ct=4836.455] FROM THE CROWD AS DEEBO SAMUEL
[ct=4837.701] TAKES IT FROM INSIDE THE FIVE.
[ct=4841.837] TIME FOR TONIGHT'S JOURNEY,
[ct=4847.156] PRESENTED BY HON DAY -- HYUNDAI.
[ct=4851.928] DEEBO SAMUEL, WE SAW HIM WITH
[ct=4852.291] THAT KICKBACK.
[ct=4853.797] KITTLE HAS A TD.
[ct=4855.809] GREAT RIGHT THERE.
[ct=4859.543] HAWKS, TOUCHDOWNS ON THE LAST
[ct=4860.720] TWO POSSESSIONS.
[ct=4868.177] KIRK: GET READY FOR THE DB TO
[ct=4868.853] CRANK UP HERE.
[ct=4870.547] THE CROWD IS EXCITED AFTER 14
[ct=4871.642] UNANSWERED.
[ct=4876.238] AL: 26 YARD LINE, FAKE TO
[ct=4878.948] ROLLING, THROWING, NO GOOD.
[ct=4884.106] KAYLEE: KYLE SHANAHAN TOLD ME HE
[ct=4885.048] WAS GOING TO PUT JORDAN MASON
[ct=4886.817] BACK TO WORK AFTER THAT LEFT
[ct=4889.715] SHOULDER INJURY, BUT THIS MAKES
[ct=4890.620] A SECOND DRIVE WHERE HE'S NOT ON
[ct=4893.780] THE FIELD.
[ct=4894.075] HE'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME WITH A
[ct=4895.620] NEW HEAVY, SUPPORTIVE TAPE JOB
[ct=4897.064] ON HIS SHOULDER AND DOING
[ct=4897.321] EVERYTHING HE CAN TO KEEP IT
[ct=4899.180] LOOSE ON THE SIDELINE, BUT NOT
[ct=4899.493] ON THE FIELD.
[ct=4903.331] AL: THERE'S KAYLEE RIGHT ON THE
[ct=4904.022] ACTION, BIRDSEYE VIEW OF THAT.
[ct=4905.883] HE WAS IN FOR ONE PLAY.
[ct=4909.509] STARTED THE SECOND HALF, EIGHT
[ct=4909.994] YARDS, CAME RIGHT OUT.
[ct=4913.062] KIRK: ARTIE BURNS JUST DROPPED
[ct=4913.785] OFF THE FIELD INJURED.
[ct=4916.620] SO THE ROOKIE OFF TO THE LEFT IS
[ct=4917.942] PRITCHETT.
[ct=4920.683] AL: CHRIS CONLEY IN MOTION.
[ct=4924.257] PURDY THOUGHT ABOUT RUNNING.
[ct=4926.791] THE THROW, MAKES THE CATCH.
[ct=4929.910] HE WAS SLOWED BY BAKER AT THE
[ct=4930.415] LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=4931.969] IT WILL BE THIRD AND 10.
[ct=4934.534] KIRK: AMAZING WHAT MOMENTUM CAN
[ct=4935.089] DO FOR THE DEFENSE.
[ct=4937.794] THE DEFENSE HAS BEEN STRUGGLING
[ct=4940.416] AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND
[ct=4940.896] STRUGGLING AGAINST THE SCHEME.
[ct=4942.346] ALL OF A SUDDEN A LITTLE MORE
[ct=4944.237] JUICE, A LITTLE MORE EFFORT.
[ct=4947.316] THE CHANCE TO GET OFF THE FIELD
[ct=4963.511] AL: THIRD AND 10.
[ct=4968.711] PURDY HIT AS HE THROWS.
[ct=4972.038] CAUGHT AT THE 30 BUT SHY OF THE
[ct=4975.417] LOVE MAKES THE TACKLE ONTO ON
[ct=4975.417] JENNINGS.
[ct=4978.379] FOURTH DOWN AND THE NINERS ARE
[ct=4978.612] GOING TO PUNT AGAIN.
[ct=4982.406] KIRK: MY GOSH, THIS IS A HUGE
[ct=4982.899] PLAY AND YOU'RE OUT IN SPACE.
[ct=4987.142] YOU HAVE TO COME UP, NOBODY ELSE
[ct=4987.991] OUT THERE.
[ct=4988.416] IT'S ONE-ON-ONE.
[ct=4990.309] CAN YOU
[ct=4991.616] FIELD?
[ct=4996.609] AL: THE END OF THREE, OR ARE WE
[ct=4998.446] DO FOR A FABULOUSRE GOING TO PUN
[ct=5000.265] SEATTLE HAS A CHANCE.
[ct=5004.156] TO TAKE THE LEAD WITH A
[ct=5004.571] TOUCHDOWN HERE.
[ct=5005.838] WE WILL SEE HOW THE DRIVE
[ct=5006.942] COMMENCES.
[ct=5010.489] FAIR CATCH ALL KINDS OF CALL TO
[ct=5010.922] -- CONTACT.
[ct=5015.424] WILLIAMS PULLED UP WITH A
[ct=5016.715] CATCH.
[ct=5017.147] WHO DID WHAT?
[ct=5022.202] CHRIS CONLEY RAN INTO HIM.
[ct=5031.753] KIRK: WITHERSPOON LOOKS LIKE HE
[ct=5032.409] MAY HAVE PUSHED HIM INTO THE
[ct=5032.409] RETURNER.
[ct=5035.946] AL: THAT'S THE DISCRETION RIGHT
[ct=5055.020] SO IF THEY PICK IT UP --
[ct=5058.676] KIRK: CONLEY SAYING, HE PUSHED
[ct=5059.681] ME, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
[ct=5062.673] >> THE SAN FRANCISCO PLAYER WHO
[ct=5064.309] HIT THE SEAHAWK RECEIVER WAS
[ct=5065.515] BLOCKED INTO HIM, THEREFORE
[ct=5066.523] THERE IS NO FOUL.
[ct=5069.821] IT WILL BE FIRST DOWN AND 10,
[ct=5074.598] AL: IT'S HARD TO GET THE DEMONS
[ct=5075.560] OUT OF YOUR HEAD, THE 49ERS HAVE
[ct=5078.781] BLOWN TWO DOUBLE-DIGIT LEADS
[ct=5080.746] THIS SEASON.
[ct=5082.125] TO THE RAMS IN ARIZONA AND HERE
[ct=5083.420] THEY ARE AGAIN ON THE VERGE.
[ct=5088.988] KIRK: THAT'S WHAT WE HEARD ABOUT
[ct=5089.803] ALL WEEK, WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM
[ct=5089.803] THOSE MISTAKES.
[ct=5091.748] YOU HAVE TO FINISH, THINGS OF
[ct=5092.231] THAT NATURE.
[ct=5095.153] UP 20 AFTER THAT KICKOFF RETURN,
[ct=5098.725] IT HAS BEEN A DIFFERENT ENERGY.
[ct=5102.334] GENO SMITH, HE IS A STREAKY
[ct=5102.334] QUARTERBACK.
[ct=5103.930] 5-6 FOR 78 YARDS ON THE LAST
[ct=5106.174] HE GOT INTO THEHE FIELD STANDS A
[ct=5106.543] CALLED.
[ct=5110.511] IT WILL BE SEATTLE BALL, FIRST
[ct=5110.886] AND 10.
[ct=5114.208] AL: THIS IS AS CLOSE AS A GETS.
[ct=5116.084] WHAT DID YOU SEE?
[ct=5120.003] >> WE SAW A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT
[ct=5121.436] ANGLES WHERE IT IS CLEAR IT HITS
[ct=5123.464] THE FINGER OF THE RECEIVING TEAM
[ct=5123.464] PLAYER.
[ct=5126.850] THEN THERE IS A CLEAR RECOVERY
[ct=5127.319] FROM SAN FRANCISCO.
[ct=5130.000] I THINK THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN
[ct=5130.000] REVERSED.
[ct=5131.355] AL: IT IS NOT.
[ct=5133.662] KIRK: SO MUCH GOING ON THERE.
[ct=5137.774] YOU HAVE A GUIDE LOCKED INTO THE
[ct=5138.874] RETURNER BUT IT IS UP TO THE
[ct=5140.194] RETURNER TO PROTECT HIMSELF.
[ct=5142.020] IT IS A LIVE BALL.
[ct=5144.974] THERE IS A QUICK RECOVERY.
[ct=5146.423] THERE IT IS.
[ct=5148.528] SEATTLE CATCHES A BREAK.
[ct=5150.619] AL: MAJOR.
[ct=5153.395] SECOND AND 6.
[ct=5156.454] INSIDE THE 20.
[ct=5161.510] DRAW PLAY, CHARDONNAY --
[ct=5165.701] CHARBONNET MOVES TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=5167.785] PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5173.138] KIRK: THIS KID, MOST OF THE
[ct=5173.521] CARRIES GO TO WALKER.
[ct=5178.584] HE HAD A QUIET WEEK LAST WEEK
[ct=5178.584] AGAINST THE GIANTS.
[ct=5181.544] THEY HAVE LEANED ON BOTH OF
[ct=5183.560] THESE RUNNING BACKS.
[ct=5185.999] WHAT A VERY DIFFERENT RUNNING
[ct=5189.682] NOT AS QUICK AS WALKER BUT YOU
[ct=5192.264] CAN SEE THE STRENGTH HE HAS TO
[ct=5193.096] BREAK THROUGH SOME TACKLES.
[ct=5196.280] AL: AT THE 30.
[ct=5202.999] SMITH, EVERYBODY COVERED.
[ct=5206.284] FLAG IS THROWN.
[ct=5210.886] NICK BOSA FORCED THE ISSUE.
[ct=5214.008] KIRK: THIS IS GREAT BECAUSE NOT
[ct=5215.744] ONLY.
[ct=5218.667] AL: FORCED THE ISSUE WITH THE
[ct=5220.530] KIRK: IT IS GREAT.
[ct=5225.654] THIS GUY IS LIKE A LINEBACKER AS
[ct=5226.669] FAR AS HIS INTELLIGENCE PLAYING
[ct=5227.723] DEFENSIVE END.
[ct=5232.941] I FEEL LIKE WHAT MOST PEOPLE
[ct=5233.469] RECOGNIZE WITH HIM IS HOW QUICK
[ct=5233.889] HE IS.
[ct=5237.417] REFEREE: INELIGIBLE MAN
[ct=5239.221] DOWNFIELD, OFFENSE, NUMBER 67.
[ct=5242.109] THAT PENALTY IS DECLINED.
[ct=5247.813] KIRK: THE GUY WHO SAW IT WAS A
[ct=5250.785] SCREEN FIRST IS 97.
[ct=5254.225] HE DOES NOT EVEN RUSH
[ct=5255.744] THEY ARE THINKING HE IS GOING TO
[ct=5257.275] COME TO ME.
[ct=5260.630] BOSA IS GOING TO COME TO ME.
[ct=5264.703] INSTEAD HE GETS THE PENALTY.
[ct=5267.399] AL: PERFECT ON HIS PART.
[ct=5269.141] SECOND AND 10.
[ct=5271.953] THERE WILL BE THIRD AND 10.
[ct=5278.562] CHARBONNET GAINS NARY A YARD.
[ct=5281.613] NO-HUDDLE HERE.
[ct=5295.366] KIRK: THE WAY BOSA IS PLAYING
[ct=5295.366] RIGHT NOW, YOU BETTER HAVE
[ct=5297.292] CHARBONNET OVER HERE TO THE
[ct=5298.682] RIGHT HELPING OUT.
[ct=5311.312] AL: BOSA GETS THERE BUT SMITH
[ct=5312.959] ESCAPES AND THEN JUST THROWS IT
[ct=5316.303] KIRK: I WAS SURPRISED THAT
[ct=5321.754] CHARBONNET LEAKED OUT OF THE
[ct=5323.128] BACKFIELD AND KEPT FORESIGHT ON
[ct=5327.216] AN ISLAND -- FORSYTHE ON AN
[ct=5327.216] ISLAND.
[ct=5331.260] HE IS DOING A GOOD JOB, TRYING
[ct=5331.260] HARD.
[ct=5334.671] THE BALL ALMOST CAME OUT.
[ct=5337.033] HE GOT HIS HANDS ON THE BALL.
[ct=5340.334] THE THIRD RIGHT TACKLE FOR THIS
[ct=5341.639] OFFENSE.
[ct=5345.976] BOSA MAKING ALL THREE PLAYS ON
[ct=5346.349] THAT SERIES.
[ct=5352.580] AL: FOURTH PUNT OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=5353.008] ANOTHER BEAUTY.
[ct=5357.332] GETTING TACKLED AT THE 11 WAS
[ct=5359.195] COWIN FATE AWAITS.
[ct=5362.258] KIRK: THERE YOU GO.
[ct=5363.097] ARE YOU A SCARY MOVIE GUY?
[ct=5365.427] AL: NO, SIR.
[ct=5366.810] KIRK: ME EITHER.
[ct=5368.129] AL: COMEDIES.
[ct=5369.881] ROMANTIC COMEDIES.
[ct=5372.706] WE LIKE DRAMATIC AGAINST.
[ct=5376.314] WE HAD ONE LAST WEEK AND WE HAVE
[ct=5376.834] ONE TONIGHT.
[ct=5381.269] DEEBO SAMUEL IS A RUNNING BACK
[ct=5381.269] IN THIS SET.
[ct=5386.644] CONFUSION.
[ct=5387.732] THERE IS YOUR FLAG.
[ct=5388.437] NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
[ct=5391.017] NOT VERY OFTEN DO YOU SEE TWO
[ct=5394.699] GUYS IN MOTION ALMOST RUNNING
[ct=5395.721] INTO EACH OTHER.
[ct=5402.546] REFEREE: ILLEGAL SHIFT, OFFENSE,
[ct=5402.839] NUMBER 82 AND 85 BOTH MOVING.
[ct=5404.908] REPLAY FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5408.719] KIRK: BOTH TIGHT ENDS MOVING AT
[ct=5409.097] THE SAME TIME.
[ct=5415.219] I WILL GUESS THAT KITTLE IS
[ct=5415.489] PROBABLY RIGHT.
[ct=5418.709] WITH ALL DUE RESPECT.
[ct=5425.464] AL: FIRST AND 15.
[ct=5428.636] KIRK: TECHNICALLY IF YOU GO BACK
[ct=5429.446] TO WHERE THE FUMBLE HAPPENED ON
[ct=5435.812] THE POINT RETURN -- PUNT RETURN,
[ct=5436.490] IT COSTS THEM 70 YARDS OF FIELD
[ct=5437.402] DECISION.
[ct=5440.813] AL: HE THROWS OUT OF THE END
[ct=5445.872] UP TO THE 20 YARD LINE.
[ct=5449.403] KIRK: A COUPLE OF THINGS THERE.
[ct=5450.626] LOOK WHERE HE IS BACKED UP.
[ct=5456.077] HE IS STANDING ON HIS OWN GOAL
[ct=5461.511] I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO ABORT
[ct=5461.931] AND THROW IT AWAY.
[ct=5464.210] AT THE LAST SECOND HE FINDS
[ct=5468.240] JUSZCZYK ON THE CHECK DOWN.
[ct=5476.701] MASON STILL TRYING TO WORK THE
[ct=5478.823] SHOULDER LOSE ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=5485.801] UP THE MIDDLE GOES TAYLOR TO THE
[ct=5485.801] 23 YARD LINE.
[ct=5493.950] TAYLOR SEEMS TO BE DOING THE
[ct=5495.652] BULK OF THE BALL CARRYING.
[ct=5497.891] KIRK: HE IS THERE FIFTH BACK.
[ct=5500.016] WE HAVE A MAN DOWN.
[ct=5502.100] IT IS THE LEFT GUARD.
[ct=5510.566] AL: UNSUNG GUY.
[ct=5511.427] HE IS HAVING A HECK OF A YEAR.
[ct=5515.710] KIRK: THE INJURIES ARE ALL OVER
[ct=5516.828] THE LEAGUE AT THIS TIME OF YEAR.
[ct=5521.749] THESE TEAMS, BANKS HAS TO COME O
[ct=5524.839] HE HAS BEEN BATTLING A CALF
[ct=5525.188] INJURY THIS YEAR.
[ct=5527.269] HE WILL GO TO THE BENCH.
[ct=5534.506] THE BALL IS AT THE 23 YARD LINE.
[ct=5539.974] 11:17 LEFT IN THE FOURTH.
[ct=5543.098] DEEBO SAMUEL IS THE BACK.
[ct=5550.505] TOSS TO HIM.
[ct=5556.039] THEY WILL BLOW THAT PLAY DEAD
[ct=5556.786] BEFORE THE SNAP.
[ct=5559.673] KIRK: MOVEMENT ON THE RIGHT SIDE
[ct=5560.272] OF THE OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=5562.905] SEATTLE WAS DIALING IT UP.
[ct=5565.382] THEY HAVE NOT BEEN BLITZING A
[ct=5565.628] TON.
[ct=5569.605] THAT TIME EIGHT OR NINE GUYS
[ct=5569.605] WERE UPTIGHT.
[ct=5574.720] AL: A BATTLE OF ATTRITION.
[ct=5577.611] IT CERTAINLY IS EVERY TIME THESE
[ct=5577.947] TEAMS MEET.
[ct=5581.250] SEEMS LIKE THAT EVERY GAME IN
[ct=5581.602] THE NFL.
[ct=5583.499] KIRK: YEP.
[ct=5589.025] AL: SAMUEL WILL WORK HIS WAY
[ct=5590.492] OVER TO THE SIDELINE.
[ct=5591.884] HE IS OUT.
[ct=5598.015] REFEREE: THERE ARE TWO FILES ON
[ct=5600.537] FALSE START, OFFENSE, NUMBER 66.
[ct=5608.159] PERSONAL FOUL, FACEMASK, SEATTLE
[ct=5611.933] KIRK: HOW ABOUT GETTING A
[ct=5612.421] FACEMASK ON WHAT IS REALLY A
[ct=5612.421] DEAD PLAY?
[ct=5616.761] IT WAS ON SAMUEL AS HE WAS
[ct=5617.283] RUNNING THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=5620.567] THERE HE IS GRABBING A HOLD OF
[ct=5620.908] THE FACEMASK.
[ct=5626.049] THAT WAS GOING TO BE A FIVE YARD
[ct=5626.276] PENALTY THAT WAS GOING TO COST
[ct=5628.233] THE NINERS GOING BACKWARD.
[ct=5633.324] NOW 15 YARDS ON TOP OF THAT.
[ct=5637.533] AL: ANOTHER PLAYER GOT HURT
[ct=5638.015] SOMEWHERE IN THERE.
[ct=5641.042] BANKS IS OUT.
[ct=5643.979] KITTLE FOR THE MOMENT IS ON THE
[ct=5647.014] THERE IS SAMUEL LOOKING NONE THE
[ct=5649.180] WORSE AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT.
[ct=5653.540] KIRK: THAT IT'S WHERE YOU RISK
[ct=5654.068] PUTTING HIM IN THERE AS A
[ct=5654.068] BALLCARRIER.
[ct=5657.535] HE IS ONE OF YOUR BETTER
[ct=5657.637] RECEIVERS.
[ct=5661.082] BECAUSE OF THE INJURIES AND
[ct=5663.237] BECAUSE HE IS SO DARN GOOD, YOU
[ct=5663.705] WANT TO THE BALL IN HIS HANDS.
[ct=5667.310] THAT HAPPENED RIGHT AT THE
[ct=5667.765] BEGINNING OF THAT PLAY.
[ct=5670.134] IT LOOKED LIKE HE RAN INTO
[ct=5670.835] JONES.
[ct=5672.972] HIT HIM RIGHT ON THE HAND.
[ct=5677.964] INSTEAD OF FIRST AND 15, YOU GET
[ct=5678.874] POSITIVE YARDS.
[ct=5682.250] AL: HE LOOKS LIKE HE IS READY TO
[ct=5683.362] COME BACK IN.
[ct=5686.910] HE HAS TO STAY OUT FOR AT LEAST
[ct=5687.337] A PLAY.
[ct=5694.123] YOU HAVE TAYLOR AND THERE IS THE
[ct=5694.656] RUNNING BACK.
[ct=5707.435] FIRES, CAUGHT, THAT IS AIYUK TO
[ct=5709.725] THE 41 YARD LINE.
[ct=5713.618] BRANDON AIYUK WITH ONLY HIS
[ct=5714.592] SECOND CATCH OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=5716.668] SAMUEL TROTS BACK IN.
[ct=5720.036] KIRK: ANYTIME YOU SPLIT YOUR
[ct=5723.316] SAFETIES LIKE THIS, THERE IS THE
[ct=5723.887] OPENING FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO
[ct=5727.353] THAT BALL IS ANTICIPATED, IT IS
[ct=5727.584] OUT EARLY.
[ct=5730.522] HE THROWS AIYUK RIGHT INTO THAT
[ct=5733.638] WHOLE -- HOLE.
[ct=5736.401] GREAT CATCH, GREAT THROW.
[ct=5744.115] AL: SAMUEL GETS RIGHT BACK INTO
[ct=5744.115] THE ACTION.
[ct=5748.000] TO THE 40.
[ct=5750.802] >> THE SECOND HALF HAS BEEN A
[ct=5753.756] STRUGGLE FOR AARON BANKS.
[ct=5758.164] HE GOT A IV BECAUSE HE STARTED
[ct=5758.164] CRAMPING.
[ct=5762.995] NOW I AM TOLD THOSE CRAMPS ARE
[ct=5762.995] ACTING UP AGAIN.
[ct=5767.165] AS THE TRAINER WORKS ON HIS LEFT
[ct=5767.165] HAMSTRING.
[ct=5774.155] THE GOOD NEWS FOR THE NINERS AS
[ct=5779.404] THEY HAVE A SMALL BYE WEEK AFTER
[ct=5779.746] THIS GAME.
[ct=5781.267] BUT IN THEIR NEXT GAME IS
[ct=5782.474] AGAINST KANSAS CITY.
[ct=5788.878] PURDY, INCOMPLETE.
[ct=5794.096] THAT WOULD NOT HAVE GONE
[ct=5794.096] ANYWHERE ANYWAY.
[ct=5798.657] KIRK: THIS IS WHAT MIKE MCDANIEL
[ct=5799.248] WANTED ALL NIGHT.
[ct=5807.045] THEY HAVE TO GET HIM INTO
[ct=5808.047] OBVIOUS PASSING SITUATIONS.
[ct=5813.421] IF KYLE SHANAHAN IS DICTATING
[ct=5814.079] THINGS, IT WILL BE A LONG NIGHT.
[ct=5816.883] HERE IS ONE OF THE MORE CRITICAL
[ct=5817.325] MOMENTS.
[ct=5820.433] A CHANCE TO GET HIM OFF HIS
[ct=5820.676] SPOT.
[ct=5824.806] AL: HE WAS FRANTIC, HE WANTED TO
[ct=5826.420] GET DTOS
[ct=5830.207] GET DTOTSON BACK IN THE GAME.
[ct=5834.680] KITTLE IS BACK IN THE GAME.
[ct=5837.795] AND NOW YOU HAVE A TIMEOUT TAKEN
[ct=5837.795] BY SAN FRANCISCO.
[ct=5841.475] REMEMBER, THEY LOST THAT
[ct=5842.077] CHALLENGE.
[ct=5844.909] SO THEY ONLY HAVE ONE REMAINING.
[ct=5848.412] THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS GAME FOR
[ct=5853.657] SEATTLE TO WIN IT AND TAKE A TWO
[ct=5853.657] GAME LEAD.
[ct=5858.012] A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THEY
[ct=5858.972] STARTED OUT WITH THE SAME THING.
[ct=5864.515] KIRK: IF I ASK YOU WHO THE BEST
[ct=5866.491] TEAM IN THE NFC IS, NOT RIGHT
[ct=5869.651] NOW BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE
[ct=5870.172] ROSTER AND YOU LOOK AT THEIR
[ct=5873.778] POTENTIAL, I STILL THINK SAN
[ct=5874.168] FRANCISCO, ESPECIALLY IF THEY
[ct=5877.309] GET CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY BACK.
[ct=5881.079] THERE ARE SOME GOOD TEAMS OUT
[ct=5885.697] IF THEY ARE HEALTHY, THEY ARE
[ct=5886.276] STILL A FORCE.
[ct=5888.446] AL: AGREED.
[ct=5891.090] THIRD AND 9.
[ct=5895.055] PURDY FIRES, HIGH, INCOMPLETE.
[ct=5897.115] GOOD COVERAGE.
[ct=5901.544] THAT WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE.
[ct=5903.178] FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=5906.817] KIRK: THEY DROPPED BACK AND
[ct=5906.817] PLAYED ZONE.
[ct=5910.082] GOOD JOB OF COMMUNICATING.
[ct=5921.557] HE FELT PRETTY GOOD ABOUT
[ct=5922.558] GETTING THEM OFF THE FIELD.
[ct=5930.140] AL: HE WILL TRY TO DEADEN IT
[ct=5930.140] BEFORE IT GOES INTO THE END
[ct=5936.984] IT BOUNCES OUT THE 1 GO BACK TO
[ct=5938.197] CONTROVERSIAL PLAY ON THE PUNT.
[ct=5942.947] >> I SPOKE WITH WALT ANDERSON
[ct=5943.903] AND THE COMMAND CENTER IN NEW
[ct=5943.903] YORK.
[ct=5947.307] THEY DID NOT GET OUR ENHANCED
[ct=5949.946] VIDEO THAT SHOWED THE BALL
[ct=5950.726] TOUCHING THE FINGER.
[ct=5953.131] WHAT THEY HAD WAS THE RAW FEED
[ct=5955.021] FROM OUR CAMERAS AND IT WAS NOT
[ct=5955.905] CLEAR AND OBVIOUS TO THEM THAT
[ct=5956.752] IT TOUCHED THE FINGER.
[ct=5960.634] AL: OBVIOUSLY A GIGANTIC PLAY IN
[ct=5963.778] SEATTLE IS NOW BACKED UP TO
[ct=5965.615] THEIR OWN 3 YARD LINE.
[ct=5968.000] THE PASS GOES TO WALKER.
[ct=5973.610] THE IS TAKEN DOWN BY ODOM.
[ct=5976.459] KIRK: THERE IS GEORGE KITTLE
[ct=5984.018] BACK OUT ON THE FIELD FOR SAN
[ct=5988.509] WHEN SEATTLE HAS PLAYED AT THEIR
[ct=5991.099] BEST, IT HAS BEEN QUICK,
[ct=5992.923] DECISIVE SHOWS -- THROWS.
[ct=5996.386] AL: SECOND AND 4.
[ct=6006.090] PASS IS CAUGHT, LOCKET, --
[ct=6007.677] LOCKETT.
[ct=6010.321] KIRK: YOU HAVE SOME
[ct=6012.177] INEXPERIENCE.
[ct=6013.986] A ROOKIE CORNER ON THE LEFT.
[ct=6018.221] ODOM IS A BACKUP SAFETY.
[ct=6023.783] THE EXTRA MAN COMES.
[ct=6023.783] THE PAST TAKEN IN.
[ct=6028.772] I ENOUGH FOR A FIRST DOWN BY DK
[ct=6033.917] KIRK: THEIR USE -- THERAPY
[ct=6037.725] KIRK: THEIR USE -- THERAE HE IS
[ct=6038.348] SHOWING HIS PHYSICALITY.
[ct=6040.385] HE MAKES A GREAT CATCH.
[ct=6043.124] AL: IS THIRD OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=6045.442] 49 YARDS TOTAL.
[ct=6049.400] METCALF AGAIN THIS TIME ON THE
[ct=6051.574] KIRK: HOLDING CALL.
[ct=6053.342] AL: THEY FLAG HERE.
[ct=6055.602] 28 YARD LINE.
[ct=6060.144] REFEREE: HOLDING, OFFENSE,
[ct=6060.144] NUMBER 88.
[ct=6063.318] 10 YARD PENALTY FROM THE SPOT OF
[ct=6066.230] THE FOUL.
[ct=6071.394] KIRK: HE WAS OUT IN FRONT TRYING
[ct=6071.875] TO MAKE A BLOCK.
[ct=6073.894] WE TALKED ABOUT THE ROOKIE
[ct=6075.795] TRYING TO GET THE LEVERAGE.
[ct=6078.322] THAT IS ROOKIE ON ROOKIE.
[ct=6082.075] HE GRABS THE JERSEY BECAUSE OF
[ct=6083.599] THE EFFORT AND THE TECHNIQUE.
[ct=6091.882] THEY HAD A LITTLE BIT OF
[ct=6091.882] MOMENTUM.
[ct=6094.961] THEY GO BACKWARDS AFTER THAT.
[ct=6097.863] AL: FIRST AND 18.
[ct=6104.220] RUSH FOUR.
[ct=6106.178] DANCING IN THE POCKET.
[ct=6108.781] INTERCEPTED!
[ct=6111.669] PICKED OFF BY GREEN.
[ct=6117.393] THE ROOKIE INVOLVED IN THE LAST
[ct=6117.946] PLAY IS INVOLVED IN THE NEXT
[ct=6121.285] THE ROOKIE OUT OF FLORIDA STATE
[ct=6122.608] WITH A HUGE PICK.
[ct=6126.783] KIRK: GENO SMITH HAS ALL THE
[ct=6127.657] TIME THAT HE NEEDS.
[ct=6134.019] FORSYTHE HOLDS UP ON THE OUTSIDE
[ct=6134.019] AGAINST BOSA.
[ct=6137.841] WHAT A JOB BY THIS ROOKIE OF
[ct=6138.452] STEPPING IN FRONT.
[ct=6140.588] HE IS OUT THERE ON AN ISLAND
[ct=6142.752] AGAINST ONE OF THE BEST IN THE
[ct=6142.752] NFL.
[ct=6146.617] HE SHOWS SOME MOXIE HERE FOR A
[ct=6146.996] YOUNG GUY.
[ct=6149.429] HE STEPS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THAT
[ct=6153.316] GENO SMITH WENT TO LEFT, RIGHT,
[ct=6155.802] CAME BACK, HE COULD SQUEEZE ONE
[ct=6158.054] INTO THE BIG RECEIVER, DK
[ct=6160.620] THAT IS A BALL HE WOULD LOVE TO
[ct=6161.170] HAVE BACK.
[ct=6165.177] AL: TWO INTERCEPTIONS TONIGHT BY
[ct=6169.577] GREEN THE FIRST OF HIS CAREER.
[ct=6171.498] KITTLE BACK INTO THE GAME.
[ct=6175.441] THREE TURNOVERS FOR THE HAW
[ct=6178.443] KS, NONE FOR THE NINERS.
[ct=6182.758] TO THE OUTSIDE, TURNS IT BACK,
[ct=6185.214] GETS INSIDE THE 10 YARD LINE.
[ct=6190.621] KIRK: BROWN STARTED TO LOSE
[ct=6191.351] GROUND.
[ct=6193.069] I THINK GENO SMITH EXPECTED HIM
[ct=6193.649] TO COME ACROSS THE FIELD.
[ct=6196.981] INSTEAD HE LOST GROUND AND GOT
[ct=6199.709] DEPTH, MAKING IT EASIER FOR
[ct=6201.218] GREEN TO STEP IN FRONT OF
[ct=6204.580] THAT IS WHAT I THINK GENO SMITH
[ct=6206.792] WAS FRUSTRATED ABOUT.
[ct=6210.864] A MISCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE
[ct=6212.705] RECEIVER AND THE QUARTERBACK.
[ct=6223.301] GAIN OF MAYBE A YARD OR SO.
[ct=6226.815] THIRD DOWN AND 3.
[ct=6230.252] KIRK: AT THIS POINT, OBVIOUSLY,
[ct=6230.686] THEY ARE NOT IN ANY HURRY.
[ct=6233.709] THEY WOULD LOVE A TOUCHDOWN BUT
[ct=6235.110] A FIELD WOULD DO THE JOB AS WELL
[ct=6237.208] TO GET THEM UP BY A COUPLE OF
[ct=6237.208] POSSESSIONS.
[ct=6240.880] GENO HAS TO PUT THAT ON
[ct=6243.344] STILL 6:42
[ct=6247.771] AL: YOU WILL HAVE TO FIND A NEW
[ct=6248.845] DEVICE TO LOOK AT THE VIDEO.
[ct=6252.600] NOT SINCE BILL BELICHICK HAVE WE
[ct=6253.560] SEEN A SLAM DOWN SINCE THAT.
[ct=6255.721] THIRD AND 4.
[ct=6262.541] PURDY, SHOULDERS SHAKE, THROWS
[ct=6262.541] INTO TRAFFIC.
[ct=6268.258] TITTLE, -- KITTLE, TOUCHDOWN,
[ct=6268.258] HIS SECOND.
[ct=6273.974] KITTLE WENT BACK TO THE LOCKER
[ct=6276.277] ROOM, COMES BACK, NOW HE IS
[ct=6277.324] GOING TO CELEBRATE.
[ct=6280.874] KIRK: THAT IS BOTH OF THEIR
[ct=6282.038] WIVES.
[ct=6286.818] THEY KNEW EXACTLY IF THEY SCORE,
[ct=6287.163] THEY ARE COMING UP INTO THE
[ct=6287.819] STANDS TONIGHT.
[ct=6289.883] AL: DOUBLE DATING.
[ct=6293.031] KIRK: THEY GET THE FULLBACK IN
[ct=6294.422] THE RUNNING BACK TO CLEAR OUT.
[ct=6295.378] THEY TAKE TWO DEFENDERS WITH
[ct=6295.378] THEM.
[ct=6298.070] NOW IT IS JUST ONE-ON-ONE IN THE
[ct=6298.070] MIDDLE.
[ct=6300.419] THAT IS A MATCHUP YOU ARE GOING
[ct=6304.061] TO WIN EVERY TIME WITH KITTLE.
[ct=6306.923] THE TIMING WITH PURDY.
[ct=6309.059] HE MAKES A GOOD THROW ON-TIME.
[ct=6311.981] AL: GOING FOR TWO TO TRY TO MAKE
[ct=6313.408] IT A 14 POINT ADVANTAGE.
[ct=6316.621] PURDY THROWS, FLAG IS THROWN.
[ct=6323.394] BOTH OF KITTLE'S TOUCHDOWNS
[ct=6323.394] TONIGHT HAVE COME ON THIRD DOWN
[ct=6327.990] REFEREE: OFFSIDES, DEFENSE,
[ct=6328.683] NUMBER 28, LINED UP IN THE
[ct=6329.395] NEUTRAL ZONE.
[ct=6331.798] THE BALL WILL BE PLACED AT THE 1
[ct=6335.572] AL: THAT IS ON A ROOKIE.
[ct=6341.063] KITTLE NOW WITH TWO TOUCHDOWNS
[ct=6342.840] TONIGHT AND FIVE FOR THE SEASON.
[ct=6349.266] KIRK: THE ROOKIE, GREEN, WHAT A
[ct=6350.743] TIME TO HAVE THAT INTERCEPTION.
[ct=6356.644] AL: FROM THE 1.
[ct=6359.693] FOR TWO.
[ct=6362.899] STUFFED.
[ct=6365.494] NO.
[ct=6372.656] 6:20 LEFT IN THE FOURTH IN
[ct=6374.590] SEATTLE WHERE THE 49ERS ARE UP
[ct=6375.956] BY A DOZEN.
[ct=6381.011] CHECK WITH A
[ct=6381.011] CELEBRATION TANDEN.
[ct=6385.615] THERE THEY ARE, LOOKING FOR
[ct=6385.615] THEIR WIVES.
[ct=6388.430] WHAT TO WE CALL THAT?
[ct=6391.741] KIRK: I LOVE THE PUNCH.
[ct=6395.245] AL: AND THEN THEY GO AND WATCH
[ct=6398.326] IT.
[ct=6403.210] KIRK: KITTLE FOR GOD, HE HAD TO
[ct=6403.210] BE REMINDED.
[ct=6412.766] AL: SAN FRANCISCO BY 12.
[ct=6420.181] WILLIAMS TRIPPED UP AT THE 30
[ct=6426.238] KIRK: HERE ARE THE NEXT
[ct=6426.238] GENERATION STATS.
[ct=6439.381] HE HAS BEEN A FORCE IN THE RUN
[ct=6439.595] GAME TONIGHT.
[ct=6448.757] HE KNEW HE WOULD HAVE TO STEP
[ct=6450.330] AL: NO DOUBT.
[ct=6453.682] THE SEAHAWKS TAKE A BALL AT THE
[ct=6455.092] 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=6458.528] DOWN BY A COUPLE OF POSSESSIONS.
[ct=6465.366] NEXT TO NOTHING.
[ct=6470.817] KIRK: SEATTLE -3 IN TURNOVERS
[ct=6475.208] THAT HAS BEEN THE DIFFERENCE IN
[ct=6476.146] THIS FOOTBALL GAME.
[ct=6493.138] AL: SECOND AND 9.
[ct=6502.532] SMITH FIRES, CAUGHT, AND OUT FOR
[ct=6502.906] A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=6509.029] KIRK: WITH SAN FRANCISCO SITTING
[ct=6511.892] BACK, GENO SMITH HAS TO NOT ONLY
[ct=6513.791] COMPLETE PASSES, HE HAS TO HAVE
[ct=6516.148] A SENSE OF URGENCY WITH THIS
[ct=6517.281] MUCH TIME LEFT IN THE FOOTBALL
[ct=6518.761] GAME AT A TWO POSSESSION GAME.
[ct=6521.160] AL: SMITH UNDER PRESSURE.
[ct=6524.346] HE GETS AWAY.
[ct=6531.334] SMITH AND JAKE BUT MAKING THE
[ct=6536.714] THAT WILL TAKE US DOWN TO THE
[ct=6536.714] FIVE MINUTE MARK L

[ct=6564.537] BACKSIDE.
[ct=6567.315] GOOD AGAINST GOOD.
[ct=6577.790] BOSA MATCHED UP THERE AGAIN.
[ct=6584.777] AL: THIRD DOWN AND 5.
[ct=6586.096] A FLAG.
[ct=6590.026] NO INDEED, METCALF WILL TAKE IT
[ct=6590.026] TO THE END ZONE.
[ct=6593.884] WHAT ABOUT THE FLAG BACK AT THE
[ct=6593.884] LINE OF SCRIMMAGE?
[ct=6599.220] ILLEGAL SHIFT WILL BE THE CALL
[ct=6600.593] AGAINST SEATTLE.
[ct=6604.472] NEGATED WHAT YOU JUST SAW.
[ct=6613.893] REFEREE: ILLEGAL SHIFT, SEATTLE.
[ct=6621.893] KIRK: HE WENT OUT IN MOTION.
[ct=6625.849] HE NEVER STOPS.
[ct=6631.187] HERE IS WALKER RIGHT HERE.
[ct=6636.482] WHEN HE GOES OUT TO THE LEFT, HE
[ct=6636.482] KEEPS MOVING.
[ct=6640.551] HE NEEDS TO COME SET AT HE NEVER
[ct=6644.529] THE RELEVANT PENALTY COSTS THE
[ct=6645.817] SEAHAWKS A HUGE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=6651.150] AL: THIRD AND 10 AFTER THE FLAG.
[ct=6653.793] FIGHTING FOR IT.
[ct=6657.772] BOBO GETS IT.
[ct=6661.817] KIRK: JAKE BOBO FIGHTING FOR
[ct=6664.471] THAT FIRST DOWN.
[ct=6668.383] HE HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN SPECIAL
[ct=6668.383] TEAMS.
[ct=6673.910] AL: SMITH OUTSIDE.
[ct=6677.828] HE GOES RIGHT BACK TO BOBO.
[ct=6683.259] A GAIN OF SEVEN.
[ct=6687.296] KIRK: METCALF CHECKS BACK INTO
[ct=6694.205] THAT TOUCHDOWN WAS PERFECTLY
[ct=6694.205] THROWN.
[ct=6708.819] BOSA TRYING TO COME IN.
[ct=6711.479] SEATTLE WILL RECOVER THE BALL.
[ct=6716.742] BRADFORD IS THERE.
[ct=6720.858] KIRK: YOU KNOW WHO KNOCKED THE

[ct=6751.229] AL: WATER HAS HAD FOUR FORCED
[ct=6752.713] FUMBLES THE SEASON.
[ct=6756.658] KIRK: AS GOOD AS HE IS IN EVERY
[ct=6758.021] OTHER ASPECT, THIS IS PROBABLY
[ct=6760.617] THE THING THAT ANNOUNCERS TALK
[ct=6761.912] ABOUT THE MOST BECAUSE HE DOES
[ct=6763.163] IT ON SUCH A REGULAR BASIS.
[ct=6765.899] HE HAS A KNACK FOR IT.
[ct=6768.628] HE SAID SOMETIMES YOU JUST FEEL
[ct=6769.909] THAT ONE WAS PERFECT.
[ct=6781.733] AL: WALKER FIGHTS FOR THE FIRST
[ct=6787.123] SEATTLE HAS ALL OF ITS TIMEOUTS
[ct=6788.400] AND THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=6791.052] KIRK: TRYING TO GET THIS SCORE
[ct=6794.059] IN BEFORE NEEDING TO USE THE
[ct=6796.376] TWO-MINUTE WARNING OR A TIMEOUT.
[ct=6801.675] AL: GENO SMITH ON THE MOVE.
[ct=6807.136] KIRK: HE MISSED ONE.
[ct=6811.058] HE HAD WALKER DOWN THE RIGHT
[ct=6816.435] NO ONE TOOK HIM DOWN THE RIGHT
[ct=6825.813] HE WAS RIGHT IN THE DIRECTION.
[ct=6829.792] HE WAS OUT OF THE POCKET.
[ct=6832.447] JUST DID NOT SEE HIM.
[ct=6836.298] AL: THAT IS TAUGHT.
[ct=6836.298] WALKER.
[ct=6840.329] TACKLE AFTER A VERY SHORT AGAIN.
[ct=6861.709] SMITH CAUGHT UNDERNEATH.
[ct=6868.590] THE CLOCK KEEPS ROLLING.
[ct=6872.789] KIRK: EVERYBODY IS TIRED OUT ON
[ct=6872.789] THAT FIELD.
[ct=6879.311] SMITH TRIED TO GET ONE MORE
[ct=6879.311] PLAYOFFS.
[ct=6884.588] AL: FIRST AND GOAL.
[ct=6888.500] WELL PROTECTED.
[ct=6893.895] LOCKETT REACHING FOR IT.
[ct=6895.280] STRETCHING.
[ct=6896.556] THERE IS YOUR TWO-MINUTE
[ct=6897.824] WARNING.
[ct=6904.609] THEY HAVE THREE TIMEOUTS.
[ct=6905.835] DOWN BY 12.
[ct=6909.817] KIRK: GIVE THIS OFFENSIVE LINE A
[ct=6909.817] LOT OF CREDIT.
[ct=6920.572] THE GOT INSIDE THE SAFETY.
[ct=6924.520] THAT WOULD'VE BEEN A SPECTACULAR
[ct=6931.113] HE TRIES TO USE HIS BODY CON
[ct=6932.403] TO GET THAT BALL DOWN.
[ct=6936.376] AL: COMING UP AFTER THE GAME,
[ct=6939.197] THE POST GAME SHOW, EXCLUSIVELY
[ct=6940.416] ON PRIME.
[ct=6943.172] PLENTY TO TALK ABOUT.
[ct=6959.995] KIRK: WALKER SLIPS DOWN THE
[ct=6971.028] THOSE WERE A COUPLE OF TOUCHDOWN
[ct=6971.866] OPPORTUNITIES.
[ct=6977.512] THAT SAVES THE CLOCK AND GIVES
[ct=6977.512] YOU A CHANCE.
[ct=6989.657] AL: THE BACK IS CHARBONNET.
[ct=6993.089] THAT IS OUT OF THE END ZONE.
[ct=7007.651] YOU KNOW WHAT IS INTERESTING IN
[ct=7008.464] THIS GAME WITH ALL OF THE
[ct=7009.156] PRESSURE ON THE QUARTERBACK?
[ct=7010.509] NO SACKS.
[ct=7011.990] NONE.
[ct=7015.240] I JUST LOOKED AT THAT.
[ct=7017.606] IT DOES NOT FEEL LIKE THAT.
[ct=7020.741] KIRK: GOOD FEELS LIKE THERE
[ct=7023.578] AL: THIRD AND GOAL.
[ct=7025.946] ESPECIALLY RIGHT THERE.
[ct=7028.886] AGAIN, THE PRESSURE WAS ON.
[ct=7031.753] FORCING SMITH TO THROW OFF OF
[ct=7033.135] HIS BACK FOOT.
[ct=7037.639] THE OFFENSIVE LINE DID NOT MOVE.
[ct=7044.754] I THOUGHT MAYBE THERE WOULD BE A
[ct=7045.005] POTENTIAL FLAG.
[ct=7048.891] WATCH THE LEFT SIDE OF THE LINE.
[ct=7051.875] THE BALL IS SNAPPED.
[ct=7053.952] NO ONE MOVES.
[ct=7061.547] AL: IT LOOKS LIKE ONLY WILLIAMS.

[ct=7092.888] FORMATION.
[ct=7095.270] HE WILL ATTACK AND THEN COME
[ct=7096.505] BACK TO THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=7099.140] GOOD JOB OF THE TOP OF THE
[ct=7099.140] ROUTE.
[ct=7101.869] EXACTLY WHERE HE WAS.
[ct=7104.489] HE HAD TO COME BACK TO THE
[ct=7109.924] BOSA, NO SACKS, HE HAS BEEN SO
[ct=7114.073] GENO FELT HIM AND GOT THE BALL
[ct=7115.390] OUT ON TIME.
[ct=7116.765] AL: THAT MAKES IT A FIVE-POINT
[ct=7120.625] 20-24.
[ct=7123.387] KIRK: MOST IMPORTANTLY, ALL
[ct=7124.670] THREE TIMEOUTS.
[ct=7133.872] AL: NOW YOU ARE SEATTLE, IT USED
[ct=7136.549] TO BE, THE ONSIDE KICK, YOU HAVE
[ct=7137.886] TO DECLARE IT NOW IF YOU'RE
[ct=7137.886] GOING FOR IT.
[ct=7141.867] THE OTHER OPTION IS TO KICKOFF
[ct=7141.867] AND TAKE THE TIMEOUTS.
[ct=7145.870] KIRK: I THINK WITH ALL THREE
[ct=7152.638] TIMEOUTS OVER I WOULD CONSIDER
[ct=7152.638] JUST KICKING IT DEEP.
[ct=7158.010] GET THE BALL BACK TO GENO SMITH
[ct=7159.258] MAYBE WITH ABOUT A MINUTE LEFT
[ct=7159.258] TO GO.
[ct=7163.232] YOU HAVE A VETERAN QUARTERBACK
[ct=7164.586] IN A REALLY GOOD GROUP OF
[ct=7167.250] A BANGED UP SECONDARY.
[ct=7169.922] BUT YOU HAVE TO GET THE THREE
[ct=7169.922] STOPS.
[ct=7187.442] CONVENTIONAL KICK HERE.
[ct=7191.505] CONVENTIONAL AS OF THIS YEAR,
[ct=7191.505] ANYWAY.
[ct=7207.485] NOW IT IS UP TO THE D.
[ct=7213.045] KIRK: THE ONLY WILDCARD I WILL
[ct=7215.566] SAY IS THE KYLE SHANAHAN FACTOR.
[ct=7219.565] CONVENTIONAL WISDOM SAYS THREE
[ct=7220.937] RUNS, MAKE SEATTLE USE THEIR
[ct=7222.399] TIMEOUTS.
[ct=7225.008] BUT SOMETIMES HE IS ONE STEP
[ct=7225.008] AHEAD OF YOU.
[ct=7227.592] IT WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME IF AT
[ct=7230.243] SOME POINT BEFORE THIRD DOWN, A
[ct=7232.917] THROW.
[ct=7236.933] AL: AGGRESSIVENESS IS IN HIS
[ct=7236.933] DNA.
[ct=7240.811] BERENDO IS THE RUNNING BACK.
[ct=7243.466] THEY START ON THE GROUND.
[ct=7248.786] HE IS OUT IN FRONT, DOWN THE
[ct=7250.141] SIDELINE, BEING CHASED, ONE MAN
[ct=7251.421] TO BEAT.
[ct=7255.167] THAT MAN STOPS AND BUT AT THE OR
[ct=7260.451] OF ALL THE CRAZY THINGS, A 76
[ct=7260.451] YARD RUN.
[ct=7264.416] NOW SEATTLE TAKES A TIMEOUT.
[ct=7268.478] KIRK: AGAIN, THIS OUTSIDE ZONE,
[ct=7269.680] YOU THINK IT IS GOING TO BOUNCE.
[ct=7273.637] HERE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF
[ct=7277.643] GETTING TAKEN AWAY.
[ct=7284.326] OPEN SEE HOLE FOR THE BACK.
[ct=7288.296] LOOK AT A BEAUTIFUL VIEW OF IT
[ct=7288.296] RIGHT THERE.
[ct=7290.959] THE RIGHT GUARD DOES A GOOD JOB
[ct=7293.571] OF OPENING IT UP.
[ct=7296.284] HOW ABOUT THE SMART PLAY.
[ct=7300.235] HE TOOK A DIVE TO JUST KEE
[ct=7301.522] WORKING THE CLOCK.
[ct=7308.318] AL: KAREN THE -- GUERENDO WITH
[ct=7309.692] SPD EXHIBITED AT THE,.
[ct=7311.604] THE ROOKIE OUT OF LOUISVILLE.
[ct=7314.382] THE 49ERS TONIGHT HAVE RUSHED
[ct=7317.903] FOR 224 YARDS.
[ct=7320.094] KIRK: HOW ABOUT SHANAHAN RIGHT
[ct=7324.295] THEY KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO RUN IT
[ct=7324.639] AND YOU OPEN THAT UP.
[ct=7330.147] AL: YOU LOSE JORDAN MASON FOR
[ct=7330.147] MOST OF THE GAME.
[ct=7331.752] GOOD FIRST HALF EFFORT.
[ct=7334.476] ONE CARRY IN THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=7336.412] USING TAYLOR A LOT.
[ct=7338.694] THERE IS MASON.
[ct=7341.958] TAYLOR HAS BEEN DOING THE BULK
[ct=7344.167] OF THE BUYER -- BALL CARRYING.
[ct=7350.162] KIRK: IT IS AMAZING, THE BIG
[ct=7351.146] CONVERSATION WITH KYLE SHANAHAN
[ct=7354.091] AND HIS TEAM HAS BEEN WHEN WILL
[ct=7354.691] CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY BE ABLE TO
[ct=7354.691] COME BACK?
[ct=7356.838] ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS IN THE
[ct=7357.315] LEAGUE.
[ct=7359.684] YOU DO NOT HAVE MITCHELL.
[ct=7362.548] MASON IS TECHNICALLY YOUR THIRD
[ct=7368.828] TAYLOR COMES IN, HE IS YOUR
[ct=7369.237] FIFTH GOT.
[ct=7373.234] ALL OF THESE GUYS HAVE CARRIED
[ct=7373.234] THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=7377.572] TALK ABOUT DEPTH IN THE
[ct=7381.539] AL: SECOND AND GOAL.
[ct=7390.659] JUSZCZYK.
[ct=7392.144] THAT WILL SEAL THE DEAL.
[ct=7393.802] KIRK: WHERE IS SHE?
[ct=7399.978] AL: THIS TIME SAMUEL JOINS THE
[ct=7401.642] PARTY.
[ct=7404.212] KITTLE AS WELL.
[ct=7407.122] ONE MORE TIME.
[ct=7409.588] KIRK: THAT IS TO GOOD.
[ct=7412.858] HE WAS MORE FOCUSED ON THAT.
[ct=7419.439] WHAT A JOB BY THIS OFFENSE WITH
[ct=7419.713] A GAME ON THE LINE.
[ct=7423.822] EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU'RE GOING TO
[ct=7423.822] RUN.
[ct=7428.311] THE OLD SCHOOL FULLBACK DIVE.
[ct=7430.181] HOW FITTING OF A WAY THIS 49ERS
[ct=7432.941] TEAM TO DO THIS.
[ct=7436.748] A GREAT WAY TO FINISH THIS ON
[ct=7441.337] AL: EXTRA POINT IS GOOD.
[ct=7444.011] HE HAS HAD A PERFECT NIGHT IN
[ct=7444.486] HIS 49ER DEBUT.
[ct=7447.623] JUSZCZYK RIGHT THERE.
[ct=7454.452] 36-24.
[ct=7456.080] THEY REHEARSED IT EARLIER.
[ct=7456.392] AND THEN THE REPLAY.
[ct=7458.160] KIRK: THAT IS GOOD.
[ct=7462.801] AL: EACH TEAM COMES OFF A GUT
[ct=7463.372] WRENCHING LOSS.
[ct=7471.120] ARIZONA KNOCKING OFF SAN
[ct=7476.707] THEY WILL COME OUT OF HERE WITH
[ct=7476.707] A HUGE VICTORY TO GET BACK TO
[ct=7481.508] 3-3 AND DROP SEATTLE TO 3-3.
[ct=7484.725] ARIZONA, WHO KNOWS?
[ct=7486.734] KIRK: YES.
[ct=7488.201] AL: WHO KNOWS.
[ct=7491.087] FEEL, DON'T THEY?
[ct=7492.702] AL: DEFINITELY.
[ct=7495.983] SEATTLE WILL GO TO ATLANTA NEXT
[ct=7501.764] BUFFALO COMES HERE AND THE RAMS
[ct=7502.361] COME HERE.
[ct=7515.200] WILLIAMS WILL RUN THIS.
[ct=7518.313] KIRK: ANOTHER KICKER HAD TO MAKE
[ct=7518.768] A TACKLE.
[ct=7521.542] HE IS NOT HAPPY.
[ct=7523.155] HE GOT POUNDED.
[ct=7526.053] HE FELT THAT.
[ct=7528.503] HE WAS ON A COUCH LAST WEEK AND
[ct=7528.886] NOW HE JUST GOT RUN OVER.
[ct=7531.582] HE IS FEELING IT.
[ct=7535.164] HE THREW EVERYTHING HE HAD INTO
[ct=7537.997] AL: WE WERE TALKING TO KYLE LAST
[ct=7540.062] WEEK, DON'T YOU TELL YOUR
[ct=7540.062] KICKER?
[ct=7542.983] HE SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
[ct=7544.983] I HAVE GOTTEN BURNED.
[ct=7553.035] SMITH DANCING IN THE POCKET.
[ct=7555.903] HE THROWS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=7561.613] SMITH-INJIGBA THE INTENDED
[ct=7563.679] RECEIVER -- INTENDED RECEIVER.
[ct=7568.136] MCCAFFREY, LAST WEEK HE WAS ON
[ct=7568.136] THE INJURY REPORT.
[ct=7572.944] YOU CAN FIGURE THAT OUT.
[ct=7576.616] THERE IS NO REAL TIMELINE
[ct=7577.138] SCHEDULED TO BRING HIM BACK.
[ct=7582.610] I WAS TALKING TO JOHN LYNCH.
[ct=7584.986] THEY HOPE MAYBE A FEW WEEKS.
[ct=7587.022] WE WILL SEE.
[ct=7592.567] KIRK: THAT IS THE FEAR.
[ct=7594.793] WITH AN INJURY LIKE THAT.
[ct=7599.230] NOBODY KNOWS HIS BODY BETTER
[ct=7599.507] THAN CHRISTIAN MCCAFFREY.
[ct=7604.048] THE WAY HE TAKES CARE OF IT
[ct=7604.302] YEAR-ROUND.
[ct=7610.360] HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BE AN
[ct=7610.769] OPPORTUNITY FOR THE TEAM TO MAKE
[ct=7611.067] A STRETCHER ON.
[ct=7626.847] WE MIGHT BE DEALING WITH A
[ct=7626.847] SHOULDER INJURY.
[ct=7630.867] AL: HE HAS 10 DAYS TO RECOVER.
[ct=7634.660] WHATEVER IT IS.
[ct=7645.402] JOHN LYNCH, WHAT A CAREER HE
[ct=7645.402] HAD.
[ct=7649.360] ALL OF FAME.
[ct=7649.360] WENT INTO BROADCASTING.
[ct=7652.994] HAD A CHANCE TO COME BACK TO SAN
[ct=7655.523] FRANCISCO AND TAKE THIS JOB.
[ct=7658.541] THEY HAVE BEEN TO FOUR OF THE
[ct=7663.247] LAST FIVE IN AFC CHAMPIONSHIP
[ct=7663.698] GAMES.
[ct=7673.611] KIRK: JUST AS FAR AS PUTTING THE
[ct=7674.918] SAME KIND OF PRODUCT OUT THERE
[ct=7675.362] YEAR AFTER YEAR.
[ct=7680.498] AL: THE NINERS OR A REGAL
[ct=7680.927] FRANCHISE.
[ct=7685.717] BILL WALSH WAS SO MUCH A PART OF
[ct=7688.899] SO GOOD OF LATE.
[ct=7699.977] THE FLAG STOPS THE PLAY.
[ct=7703.056] WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT.
[ct=7704.825] EARLIER TODAY.
[ct=7710.856] FALSE START, OFFENSE, NUMBER 19.
[ct=7712.443] STILL FIRST DOWN.
[ct=7717.265] AL: WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE
[ct=7717.265] 49ERS, FIVE SUPER BOWL
[ct=7718.996] VICTORIES.
[ct=7720.437] BUT NONE IN 30 YEARS.
[ct=7723.193] KIRK: I WAS SHOCKED WHEN YOU
[ct=7723.193] SAID THAT.
[ct=7727.162] IT FEELS LIKE THEY ARE HOVERING
[ct=7727.704] AROUND IT EVERY YEAR.
[ct=7730.162] AL: THEY ARE.
[ct=7733.055] HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SEAL THE
[ct=7735.945] DEAL SINCE THE 1994 SEASON.
[ct=7738.038] FINALLY A SACK.
[ct=7742.172] FIRST OF THE GAME.
[ct=7745.594] KIRK: I THINK IT IS WORTH
[ct=7745.594] SAYING.
[ct=7754.474] SOME OF THEIR OWN MEDIA WAS
[ct=7755.116] FRUSTRATED WITH THE WAY THEY
[ct=7755.887] PLAY LAST WEEK.
[ct=7761.459] THEY WERE TESTED.
[ct=7772.578] THE CROWD GOING WILD.
[ct=7777.739] DESPITE ALL THOSE INJURIES.
[ct=7789.070] AL: SECOND AND 23.
[ct=7804.091] GREEN MAKES THE TACKLE ON FANT.
[ct=7809.742] DOWN TO 20 SECONDS.
[ct=7824.642] KIRK: SEATTLE WITH A NEW COACH,
[ct=7825.383] NEW COORDINATORS.
[ct=7830.356] INTERESTING TO SEE WHERE THEY GO
[ct=7830.356] FROM HERE.
[ct=7835.130] I THINK THIS OFFENSE HAS A REAL
[ct=7835.130] CHANCE.
[ct=7843.169] AL: SMITH LAUNCHING.
[ct=7847.152] 11 SECONDS.
[ct=7859.326] BROCK PURDY TONIGHT.
[ct=7864.075] IT IS ALMOST LIKE HIS
[ct=7864.605] PERSONALITY.
[ct=7866.851] THE NUMBERS ARE GOOD.
[ct=7869.265] THREE TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=7874.190] THERE HE GOES.
[ct=7879.106] WHAT WAS I DOING GETTING
[ct=7879.514] INVOLVED IN THAT TACKLE?
[ct=7881.102] WHY?
[ct=7887.333] DID NOT MISS A TICK.
[ct=7899.670] THE NINERS ERASED THAT TASTE
[ct=7901.556] FROM A BETTER LOSS.
[ct=7905.505] YOU GET RID OF THAT BAD TASTE.
[ct=7909.803] KIRK: NOW YOU HAVE 10 DAYS TO
[ct=7911.020] GET READY BEFORE YOU GET KANSAS
[ct=7911.020] CITY.
[ct=7915.471] HOPEFULLY A CHANCE TO RECOVER ON
[ct=7915.833] SOME OF THOSE INJURIES.
[ct=7921.783] AL: NOBODY CAN APPRECIATE
[ct=7922.246] SECONDARY PLAY MORE THAN JOHN
[ct=7922.246] LYNCH.
[ct=7923.408] NOBODY.
[ct=7927.594] THE 49ERS ROLL INTO
