[ct=25.720] ONE OF THE TOP RUNNING BACKS IN
[ct=27.411] THE LEAGUE, AGNEW, AND FOUR OUT
[ct=32.335] OF FIVE KICKS HAVE RESULTED IN
[ct=33.162] TOUCHBACKS, AND THIS ONE DOES
[ct=33.521] TOO.
[ct=37.318] OUT COME THE JAGUARS.
[ct=40.352] LAWRENCE, NOT REALLY DOING ANY
[ct=42.397] PRACTICING THIS WEEK, JUST
[ct=42.789] REHABBING.
[ct=46.440] SEVEN TOUCHDOWNS, FOUR IN THE
[ct=49.146] TWO GAMES AGAINST INDIANAPOLIS.
[ct=51.656] DO NOT EXPECT HIM TO RUN MUCH
[ct=52.297] TONIGHT.
[ct=54.496] FROM THE 25 YARD LINE.
[ct=62.640] HE HAS THE BRACE ON THE LEFT
[ct=62.969] KNEE.
[ct=67.815] THE RUNNING BACK IN THE
[ct=68.402] BACKFIELD, STARTING IN MOTION.
[ct=72.466] GETS IT TO ETIENNE, HE IS
[ct=74.559] STUFFED AT THE LINE OF
[ct=74.559] SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=78.288] DAVIS WAS A LITTLE SHAKY THIS
[ct=78.993] WEEK, WONDERING IF HE WOULD PLAY
[ct=81.828] TONIGHT BUT THERE HE IS MAKING
[ct=82.457] THE FIRST TACKLE OF THE GAME.
[ct=86.354] KIRK: ONE THING ABOUT TREVOR
[ct=87.344] LAWRENCE AND THAT KNEE, THEY
[ct=88.592] WILL FEEL THINGS OUT EARLY.
[ct=92.081] EXPECT QUICK PASSES, NOT A LOT
[ct=95.280] OF MOBILITY, EVEN THOUGH THAT IS
[ct=96.361] A BIG PART OF HIS GAME.
[ct=98.626] QUICK PASSES ARE CRITICAL
[ct=102.272] AL: DO NOT SIT IN THE POCKET TOO
[ct=103.473] MUCH.
[ct=105.442] HE GETS RID OF IT IN A HURRY,
[ct=108.403] AND IT IS CAUGHT, NICE LIVING
[ct=110.160] GRABBED BY EVAN INGRAM FOR THE
[ct=111.618] FIRST DOWN OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=115.489] KIRK: HE IS THE SECOND FASTEST
[ct=116.470] IN THE LEAGUE GETTING THE BALL
[ct=118.664] OUT AT 2.39.
[ct=121.839] HE RECOGNIZES A GOOD CUSHION
[ct=124.052] WITH INGRAM, AND TAKES IT.
[ct=128.286] HE IS ABLE TO GIVE INGRAM THAT
[ct=130.202] CHANCE.
[ct=131.193] STAY AWAY FROM THAT LEFT KNEE.
[ct=135.138] BIG DEFENDER, GRANDERSON, GOES
[ct=135.453] DOWN LOW.
[ct=139.537] ALL FANS WOULD LOVE TO SEE
[ct=140.207] TREVOR LAWRENCE HEALTHY TONIGHT.
[ct=143.266] AL: JAGS HAVE THREE TIGHT ENDS
[ct=143.619] IN THIS SET.
[ct=149.100] PASS FAKE, ETIENNE INTO SAINTS
[ct=149.653] TERRITORY TO THE 39 YARD LINE.
[ct=152.614] HE DOES NOT GET A LOT OF
[ct=154.779] PUBLICITY BUT HE IS ONE OF THE
[ct=156.448] BEST BACKS IN THE LEAGUE RIGHT
[ct=156.448] NOW.
[ct=159.298] KIRK: HE REALLY IS, AND THEY ARE
[ct=160.669] ONE OF THE BEST SCREEN TEAMS IN
[ct=161.318] THE LEAGUE.
[ct=164.336] HE TIMED THIS UP PERFECTLY.
[ct=170.249] 68 RIGHT THERE, THEN YOU GET
[ct=173.213] ETIENNE IN SPACE.
[ct=174.701] HE IS AS GOOD AS ANYBODY WITH
[ct=175.358] ROOM TO WORK WITH.
[ct=178.988] HIS GREATEST ATTRIBUTE, THE
[ct=180.469] BALANCE AND THE ACCELERATION
[ct=180.779] UPFIELD.
[ct=184.703] AL: HE HAS MORE CARRIES AND
[ct=187.841] TOUCHES THAN ANYBODY IN THE
[ct=188.512] LEAGUE RIGHT NOW.
[ct=192.245] MALCOLM ROACH MAKING THE TACKLE.
[ct=197.111] SECOND DOWN AND 6.
[ct=200.660] KIRK: WHEN THESE GUYS WERE
[ct=201.601] TEAMMATES IN COLLEGE, EVERYBODY
[ct=203.288] WANTED TO TALK ABOUT TREVOR
[ct=204.917] LAWRENCE, BUT IF YOU WATCH
[ct=210.676] CLEMSON, ETIENNE HAD MUCH TO DO
[ct=211.285] WITH THAT SUCCESS.
[ct=217.399] AL: BIGSBY IS THE RUNNING BACK
[ct=218.416] BUT THEY SEND HIM WIDE.
[ct=223.407] LAWRENCE WILL TAKE OFF AND
[ct=225.436] SLIDES AT THE 25 YARD LINE.
[ct=227.689] THE BENCH IS HOLDING THEIR
[ct=227.971] BREATH.
[ct=235.865] KIRK: THE OTHER NIGHT HE SAID, I
[ct=237.834] WILL NOT SCRAMBLE OR RUN.
[ct=239.046] I SAID, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR
[ct=241.465] INSTINCTS TAKE OVER, HE SMILED
[ct=242.151] AND SAID I WILL TRY NOT TO.
[ct=245.143] THAT OPENED UP, HE SAW THE
[ct=245.757] NUMBERS AND COULD NOT HELP
[ct=246.040] HIMSELF.
[ct=250.056] AL: MEANWHILE, THE INJURED SAINT
[ct=251.633] IS TAYLOR.
[ct=253.120] TIMEOUT HERE.
[ct=255.205] PLAYS IN THE SLOT.
[ct=258.325] HIS NUMBERS ARE GREAT DEFENDING
[ct=260.011] OUT OF THE SLOT, BUT HAVING TO
[ct=260.547] COME OUT OF THE GAME.
[ct=271.044] KIRK: HE WAS THERE TO MAKE THE
[ct=271.664] TACKLE ON TREVOR LAWRENCE, AND
[ct=274.540] DOVE AND ENDED UP GOING DOWN.
[ct=281.048] AL: #0 COMES IN FOR #1.
[ct=284.435] KIRK: HE COMES OFF THE RIGHT
[ct=285.852] SIDE DIVING, AND LANDS
[ct=288.470] AWKWARDLY.
[ct=289.082] I DO NOT THINK THE SAINTS
[ct=291.331] THOUGHT TREVOR LAWRENCE WOULD BE
[ct=292.696] MUCH OF A THREAT TONIGHT.
[ct=293.505] THEY WERE SPREAD ALL OVER THE
[ct=293.775] FIELD.
[ct=297.036] NOBODY WAS AT LINEBACKER.
[ct=303.741] AL: NOW THE ROOKIE, BIGSBY,
[ct=304.243] COMES INTO THE BACK.
[ct=309.226] PASS IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=311.968] INTENDED FOR ENGRAM.
[ct=316.746] SECOND DOWN AND 10.
[ct=319.589] LAWRENCE, THE NUMBER ONE OVERALL
[ct=323.565] PICK, WHAT A DIFFERENCE THAT
[ct=323.856] MADE.
[ct=328.628] THE 2021 SEASON WAS ILL-FATED.
[ct=335.007] LAWRENCE, THEY WERE SO BAD THAT
[ct=336.549] YEAR, THEY HAD THE NUMBER ONE
[ct=337.528] CHOICE THE NEXT YEAR, TOO.
[ct=341.358] KIRK: LATE LAST YEAR HE WAS
[ct=341.691] PLAYING AS WELL AS ANY
[ct=343.046] QUARTERBACK IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=347.083] AL: SPINS OUT HERE, EXTRA EFFORT
[ct=350.565] BY ENGRAM, TACKLED BY LATTIMORE.
[ct=355.307] SETTING UP THIRD AND 7.
[ct=357.733] KIRK: THEY PLAY A TON OF MAN
[ct=358.508] DEMAND.
[ct=362.987] HE WAS KEPT OUT OF MOST OF THE
[ct=363.707] 2022 SEASON BUT SHOWS WHO HE CAN
[ct=364.077] GET PHYSICAL.
[ct=368.460] BIG EMPHASIS SETTING THE EDGE TO
[ct=368.764] THIS DEFENSE.
[ct=372.474] JACKSONVILLE DOES A GREAT JOB
[ct=372.870] STRETCHING YOU HORIZONTALLY.
[ct=376.295] AL: WOODS IS THE DEFENSIVE
[ct=380.373] COORDINATOR BUT ALLENâ€™
[ct=380.672] COORDINATOR BUT ALLEN'S
[ct=381.288] PEDIGREE IS DEFENSE.
[ct=386.181] THIRD DOWN AND 7.
[ct=389.758] IN THE POCKET, FIRES, CAUGHT FOR
[ct=390.338] ANOTHER FIRST DOWN.
[ct=392.715] MOVING DOWN THE FIELD, CHRISTIAN
[ct=395.889] KIRK, WHO CAME OVER LAST YEAR
[ct=396.685] FROM THE ARIZONA CARDINALS.
[ct=401.427] FOUR FIRST DOWNS ON THIS DRIVE,
[ct=402.010] EIGHT PLAYS, 60 YARDS.
[ct=408.695] KIRK: A GOOD JOB OF TREVOR
[ct=410.223] LAWRENCE, THE IDEAS TO GET THE
[ct=411.783] BALL OUT QUICKLY.
[ct=412.953] THEY THINK CHRISTIAN KIRK COULD
[ct=415.421] HAVE A HUGE NIGHT FROM THAT SLOT
[ct=415.771] POSITION.
[ct=418.684] GOOD AWARENESS OF WHERE HE
[ct=419.295] NEEDED TO GO FOR THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=422.473] AL: OUT OF THE PISTOL THIS TIME.
[ct=427.799] ETIENNE, D A LITTLE FLIP, AND
[ct=430.731] INSIDE THE 5 GOES AGNEW.
[ct=435.320] A RUNNING BACK SPECIALIST, HE
[ct=436.222] TAKES IT DOWN TO A FIRST AND
[ct=443.607] GOAL SITUATION FROM THE 2-YARD
[ct=444.288] LINE.
[ct=447.730] KIRK: THEY WILL TRY TO GET THE
[ct=449.398] BALL IN HIS HANDS, AND IT IS A
[ct=450.136] LOT OF TIMES A REVERSE LIKE
[ct=450.450] THIS.
[ct=455.893] JUST A STEP AHEAD OF THE SAINTS
[ct=457.355] WITH A QUARTERBACK, WE WONDERED
[ct=458.381] HOW HE WOULD HOLD UP.
[ct=462.250] AL: SAINTS HAVE NOT ALLOWED AN
[ct=465.617] OPENING DRIVE TD IN 18 GAMES,
[ct=466.223] AND INTO THE END ZONE FOR THE
[ct=467.472] FIRST TIME IN A YEAR, TOUCHDOWN
[ct=468.136] AGAINST THEM.
[ct=472.894] TRAVIS ETIENNE TAKES IT INTO THE
[ct=472.894] END ZONE.
[ct=475.698] THAT TOOK ONLY 5:16.
[ct=479.104] TEMPLATES, 75 YARDS.
[ct=482.919] THEY PICKED UP SIX FIRST DOWNS.
[ct=486.052] KIRK: HECK OF A DRIVE, GREAT WAY
[ct=487.029] TO START THE GAME ON THE ROAD.
[ct=490.352] THE OFFENSIVE LINE HAS HAD
[ct=490.693] ISSUES WITH INJURIES.
[ct=492.634] THEY ARE STARTING TO GEL.
[ct=497.854] AND THIS IS A NIGHT FOR THEM,
[ct=499.123] THEY HAVE BEEN MOVING PEOPLE IN
[ct=501.082] AND OUT, BUT THAT WAS A GREAT
[ct=501.362] DRIVE FOR THEM.
[ct=505.542] AL: MCMANUS, THE LONGTIME BRONCO
[ct=506.892] WITH THE EXTRA POINT.
[ct=510.742] 9:44 LEFT IN THE QUARTER.
[ct=514.087] GREAT DRIENED IN 1975.
[ct=516.856] KICKOFF HERE GOES THROUGH THE
[ct=518.506] END ZONE, AND DEREK CARR WILL
[ct=520.215] TAKE HIS TEAM TO THE 25 YARD
[ct=523.162] DEREK CARR, NINE YEARS WITH THE
[ct=524.111] RAIDERS.
[ct=528.221] THIS SEASON, FIVE TDS, TWO
[ct=529.880] PICKS.
[ct=533.184] HAD A LEAD AGAINST GREEN BAY AND
[ct=534.140] LOSS.
[ct=535.521] THEY HAVE LOST THREE OUT OF FOUR
[ct=539.303] SELF-DESTRUCTED LAST WEEK IN
[ct=540.502] HOUSTON.
[ct=541.434] TRYING TO GET IT BACK TOGETHER
[ct=542.174] HERE.
[ct=545.349] KAMARA IS THE RUNNING BACK.
[ct=548.712] CARR LOOKS ONE WAY, THE OTHER,
[ct=553.812] THEN DROP BY KAMARA ON THE FIRST
[ct=554.403] PLAY FROM SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=556.800] IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND 10.
[ct=560.382] KIRK: COMING OFF OF HOUSTON FOR
[ct=562.896] DEREK CARR, AND WITNESSING
[ct=563.816] BEFORE OUR EYES, THERE IS AN
[ct=564.804] EXAMPLE, THE TIMING AND THE
[ct=567.405] RHYTHM OF THIS OFFENSE.
[ct=568.897] YOU HAVE GREAT INDIVIDUAL
[ct=571.078] PLAYERS TRYING TO FIGURE THINGS
[ct=572.965] OUT.
[ct=574.126] WE WILL SEE HOW THEY DO TONIGHT.
[ct=577.143] AL: IN THE MIDDLE.
[ct=582.919] AN EXTRA MOVE AFTER KAMARA HAD
[ct=585.885] THE INITIAL CONTACT, FOUR YARDS
[ct=588.227] PAST THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND
[ct=591.585] TURNS IT INTO A SIX YARD GAIN.
[ct=593.366] THIRD AND 4.
[ct=597.434] KIRK: EACH WEEK WE SEE THE SAME
[ct=598.432] THEME, OFFENSIVE LINEMAN BANGED
[ct=601.154] UP, AND A PATCHWORK GROUP ON A
[ct=601.708] SHORT WEEK.
[ct=604.160] I DO NOT KNOW IF THAT HAS BEEN
[ct=605.936] MORE EVIDENT THAN NEW ORLEANS
[ct=609.530] AL: ABSOLUTELY.
[ct=612.593] STEPPING UP IN THE POCKET,
[ct=616.437] CAUGHT, JUST ENOUGH FOR THE
[ct=616.793] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=621.417] CAUGHT BY ALVIN KAMARA.
[ct=627.811] KIRK: FOR DEREK, YOU SAW A RARE
[ct=628.451] MOMENT AT THE END OF THE GAME
[ct=630.095] LAST WEEK WHERE HE WAS ANIMATED,
[ct=631.049] FRUSTRATED.
[ct=633.669] THERE WERE SOME BREAKDOWNS IN
[ct=635.169] COMMUNICATION WITH THE RECEIVERS
[ct=637.378] AND HIM NOT ON THE SAME PAGE.
[ct=640.384] NOW HE IS STRETCHED OUT.
[ct=643.635] AL: HILL.
[ct=646.733] HE WILL KEEP IT, HE WILL RUN.
[ct=649.937] HE PICKS UP ABOUT EIGHT YARDS.
[ct=654.325] IF YOU WATCH THE SAINTS, YOU
[ct=655.248] KNOW THAT HAPPENS WITH SOME
[ct=655.558] FREQUENCY.
[ct=658.805] KIRK: IT IS A GOOD CHANGEUP, YOU
[ct=660.192] HAVE A GUY WHO CAN RUN THE ZONE
[ct=660.535] READ.
[ct=663.915] HE COLLAPSES, YOU PULL THE BALL
[ct=668.060] OUT, JOSH ALLEN TAKES WILLIAMS,
[ct=670.234] NOW YOU GET TO THE SECOND LEVEL
[ct=670.592] WITH GOOD BLOCKS.
[ct=673.534] TRY TO STAY AHEAD OF THE SIX.
[ct=675.710] JACKSONVILLE DEFENSE PLAY A LOT
[ct=676.319] OF ZONE.
[ct=682.964] ESPECIALLY WITH THE OFFENSE
[ct=684.060] STRUGGLING, TAKE THOSE POSITIVE
[ct=684.369] YARDS.
[ct=687.804] AL: SECOND DOWN AND 4.
[ct=691.458] CARR STEPPING AWAY, FINDS TIME,
[ct=693.517] FAKES, PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=696.646] HE ROLLS OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=702.694] ANGELO BLACKSON CHASING HIM.
[ct=705.163] NOW THE SAINTS ON THE MOVE.
[ct=707.288] KIRK: NICE TO SEE.
[ct=711.049] YOU DO NOT ALWAYS ASSOCIATE
[ct=711.710] SCRABBLING AND CREATING WITH
[ct=713.375] DEREK CARR BUT HE REMINDS YOU HE
[ct=715.043] IS ATHLETIC ENOUGH.
[ct=720.829] HE IS IN HIS 10TH YEAR, 32 YEARS
[ct=721.572] OLD.
[ct=725.916] HERE MAKING A PLAY TO PICK UP
[ct=726.449] THE YARDAGE HE NEEDED.
[ct=736.398] AL: KAMARA SLIPS, FALLS, NO
[ct=737.078] GAIN.
[ct=742.367] IN THE HOUSE TONIGHT IS A MAN
[ct=743.547] WHO OWNED THIS HOUSE FOR ABOUT
[ct=746.260] 15 YEARS ALONG WITH SEAN PAYTON.
[ct=749.019] THERE IS DREW BREES.
[ct=752.509] SO MANY YEARS, SO MUCH
[ct=754.595] CONSISTENCY, THEY WON A SUPER
[ct=755.612] BOWL POST-KATRINA AND GOT THE
[ct=756.561] CITY BACK TOGETHER.
[ct=759.073] THEY HELPED GET THE CITY
[ct=759.646] REVITALIZED.
[ct=761.813] IT IS A DIFFERENT THING NOW.
[ct=763.841] DEREK CARR COMES IN.
[ct=767.699] SECOND AND 11.
[ct=769.963] THE PASSES CAUGHT ON THE
[ct=769.963] OUTSIDE.
[ct=775.954] NICE MOVE BY CRYSTAL B --
[ct=777.868] CHRIS OLAVE.
[ct=780.674] ANOTHER FIRST DOWN FOR NEW
[ct=781.088] ORLEANS.
[ct=783.559] KIRK: YOU ARE GOING AT THE
[ct=786.083] CORNER, TYSON CAMPBELL DOES A
[ct=788.868] NICE JOB GETTING IN FRONT.
[ct=790.234] THEY WILL PLAY SOFT AND DO NOT
[ct=792.166] WANT TO GIVE UP THE BIG PLAY.
[ct=796.716] HECKUVA JOB BY OLAVE BEING ABLE
[ct=797.483] TO SHAKE.
[ct=802.279] HE EVEN THREW THE STIFF-ARM.
[ct=804.819] AL: BACK TO THE GROUND.
[ct=807.600] KAMARA FOR A SHORT GAME.
[ct=810.617] NINTH PLAY UPCOMING.
[ct=813.163] KIRK: BOTH OF THESE OFFENSES
[ct=816.062] COMING OUT ON A SHORT WEEK WITH
[ct=817.428] TEMPO WIND ENERGY AND SUCCESS
[ct=817.782] MOVING THE STICKS.
[ct=821.789] THAT HAD NOT BEEN AN ISSUE FOR P
[ct=822.434] CARMICHAEL AND THIS OFFENSE.
[ct=825.512] IT IS ABOUT GETTING INTO THE RED
[ct=826.469] ZONE, CAN THEY COME AWAY WITH
[ct=827.848] POINTS?
[ct=830.315] THAT WAS A MAJOR CONCERN LAST
[ct=830.640] WEEK.
[ct=833.922] AL: MILLER IS THE BACK, A
[ct=835.011] ROOKIE.
[ct=837.064] HE WAS PICKED IN THE THIRD
[ct=837.613] ROUND.
[ct=839.874] SECOND AND 7.
[ct=841.446] CARR.
[ct=846.591] INCOMPLETE AT THE 20 YARD LINE.
[ct=850.788] TIPPING IT AWAY FROM OLAVE.
[ct=854.775] IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 7.
[ct=859.663] KIRK: RIGHT AWAY, LIKE THAT
[ct=860.577] TAMPA DEFENSE WERE YOU GET SOME
[ct=860.972] DEPTH.
[ct=863.035] READ GREAT JOB COMING OFF THE
[ct=866.621] DEATH -- GREAT JOB COMING OFF
[ct=867.950] THE DEPTH.
[ct=871.165] HE SHOULD BE OUT IN FRONT.
[ct=881.645] AL: PLAY CLOCK UNDER :05.
[ct=884.853] THIRD AND 7.
[ct=887.930] HE IS HIT AS HE THROWS, PASSING
[ct=888.635] COMPLETE.
[ct=890.401] PRESSURE COMING FROM THE
[ct=891.055] BACKSIDE.
[ct=895.424] THE DRIVE BOGS DOWN AFTER THREE
[ct=895.813] FIRST DOWNS.
[ct=898.547] IT IS FOURTH AND 7.
[ct=902.269] KIRK: A LOT OF NEW PIECES UP
[ct=903.534] FRONT, AND KAMARA IS LOOKING
[ct=904.331] RIGHT.
[ct=906.474] THE BLITZ COMES FROM THE NICKEL
[ct=906.840] SPOT.
[ct=909.690] NOBODY RECOGNIZES IT.
[ct=912.592] HE GETS IN SNEAKING IN LATE.
[ct=915.458] GREAT JOB DISGUISING TO THE LAST
[ct=917.320] MOMENT ON THAT THIRD DOWN.
[ct=924.535] AL: BLAKE GRUPE HAD TWO MRS.
[ct=925.752] LAST WEEK.
[ct=929.096] THIS IS -- HAD TWO MISSES LAST W
[ct=929.992] EEK.
[ct=933.740] GRUPE'S KICK IS NO GOOD.
[ct=936.944] HE HAS MISSED THREE OUT OF HIS
[ct=937.930] LAST FIVE.
[ct=938.878] THEY could be...
[ct=939.884] Kelce and Kel-see-how-much-
[ct=939.884] you-can-save-by-
[ct=942.533] bundling-home-and-auto.
[ct=945.519] Yeah?
[ct=947.719] If you make
[ct=947.719] the letters smaller.
[ct=949.409] Mahomes! MaAuto! Letâ€™s go!
[ct=952.195] Put your jersey on!
[ct=953.064] Bundling.
[ct=954.458] Just another way to save
[ct=954.458] with the Personal Price Plan.
[ct=956.135] Like a good neighbor,
[ct=956.135] State Farm is there.Â®
[ct=968.175] CAME IN, THEY WON A SUPER BOWL
[ct=968.759] THREE YEARS LATER.
[ct=974.578] CAUGHT AT THE 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=978.210] THE BALL COMES OUT, STILL ALIVE.
[ct=979.336] A SCRAMBLE FOR IT.
[ct=982.658] KIRK: THE SAINTS THINK THEY HAVE
[ct=982.967] IT.
[ct=985.213] AL: THEY DO.
[ct=993.525] GRANDERSON, #96, HAVING A REAL
[ct=994.098] GOOD YEAR.
[ct=996.523] KIRK MAKES THE GRAB.
[ct=999.408] DID HE HAVE POSSESSION?
[ct=1001.837] KIRK: IT SURE LOOKS LIKE IT.
[ct=1004.568] THE OUTSIDE CORNER DOES A GOOD
[ct=1006.593] JOB KNOCKING THE BALL LOOSE WITH
[ct=1007.297] HIS LEFT ARM.
[ct=1009.954] >> FUMBLE RECOVERED BY THE
[ct=1010.534] DEFENSE.
[ct=1018.796] KIRK: KIRK HAD A CHANCE TO GET
[ct=1019.367] ON THAT.
[ct=1023.533] IT SLIPS THROUGH THEIR HANDS,
[ct=1025.531] THE SAINTS APPEAR TO BE ON TOP
[ct=1026.167] OF THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=1031.733] FIRST AND 10, PLAY-ACTION,
[ct=1032.649] TAKING A SHOT OVER DAVIS.
[ct=1039.659] AL: ON THE MOVE AGAIN, AND THAT
[ct=1040.830] ONE COMES TO A SCREECHING HALT
[ct=1041.655] AT THE 41-YARD LINE.
[ct=1046.544] KIRK SHAKING HIS HEAD AS HE
[ct=1047.139] LOOKS AT THE REPLAY.
[ct=1050.957] THE DRIVE STARTS FROM THE
[ct=1051.223] 41-YARD LINE.
[ct=1055.048] KAMARA RUNS INTO TRAFFIC.
[ct=1058.898] NO GAIN, STOPPED AT THE LINE OF
[ct=1061.493] SECOND AND 10.
[ct=1065.017] KIRK: THERE IS A BATTLE IN THE
[ct=1065.860] LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=1068.663] THE SAINTS HAVE TO BE THANKFUL
[ct=1070.204] THE OFFENSE IS BACK ON THE
[ct=1073.004] THE WAY THEIR GAME ENDED LAST
[ct=1074.693] WEEK, A LOT OF CRITICISM
[ct=1075.014] LOCALLY.
[ct=1077.812] THEY ARE ANXIOUS TO GET BACK ON
[ct=1078.424] THE FIELD.
[ct=1081.075] THE JACKS GO RIGHT DOWN AND
[ct=1081.765] SCORE, THEN THEY MISS THE FIELD
[ct=1081.901] GOAL.
[ct=1086.600] FORTUNATE TO GET THIS TURNOVER,
[ct=1087.195] SEE IF THEY CAN DO ANYTHING WITH
[ct=1091.928] AL: PASS CAUGHT.
[ct=1098.625] OLAVE MAKES ANOTHER CATCH.
[ct=1101.451] IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 6,
[ct=1103.988] FROM NEAR MIDFIELD.
[ct=1110.127] THE JAGUAR DEFENSE, PETE
[ct=1111.266] CARMICHAEL, THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=1112.825] COORDINATOR.
[ct=1114.205] HE WAS ON THE SEAN PAYTON STAFF,
[ct=1115.513] AND SO WAS ALLEN.
[ct=1118.132] WHEN THEY HAD TO FIND A NEW
[ct=1119.615] COACH, THEY STAYED IN-HOUSE.
[ct=1124.017] WILLIAMS IS NOW IN THE GAME,
[ct=1126.298] BACK AFTER MISSING THE LAST FEW
[ct=1126.802] GAMES WITH INJURY.
[ct=1129.688] OVER THE MIDDLE, THE PASS IS
[ct=1132.517] INCOMPLETE, INTENDED FOR
[ct=1135.475] SHAHEED.
[ct=1137.681] THEY GET THE TAKE AWAY BUT
[ct=1139.308] CANNOT DO ANYTHING WITH IT.
[ct=1142.665] KIRK: HECKUVA JOB ON THIRD DOWN.
[ct=1146.630] HE DOES A GOOD JOB PLAYING DEEP
[ct=1148.736] SAFETY, CISCO, READING THE EYES
[ct=1151.111] OF DEREK CARR, AND WAITING FOR
[ct=1151.793] ANYTHING ACROSS THE MIDDLE.
[ct=1154.428] SEE HOW QUICKLY HE WAS ABLE TO
[ct=1156.452] DRIVE DOWN ANTICIPATING THE
[ct=1156.701] CROSSING ROUTE.
[ct=1159.442] EVEN IF THE BALL IS ON THE
[ct=1161.828] MONEY, HE IS ABLE TO BE THERE.
[ct=1166.720] AL: HEDLEY, THE 30-YEAR-OLD
[ct=1168.648] ROOKIE HERE ALL KINDS OF ACTION.
[ct=1171.873] NEW ORLEANS COMES UP WITH THE
[ct=1173.808] BALL, BUT WHAT WILL BE THE CALL
[ct=1174.114] HERE?
[ct=1175.898] AGNEW WAS THERE.
[ct=1177.772] AGNEW IS HURT.
[ct=1180.878] HE APPARENTLY DID NOT CALL FOR
[ct=1181.445] THE FAIR CATCH.
[ct=1183.220] LOSS THE BALL.
[ct=1186.605] ANOTHER TURNOVER BY THE JAGUARS.
[ct=1190.231] KIRK: IT LOOKED AT HIS OWN GUY
[ct=1190.739] RAN INTO HIM.
[ct=1195.570] HE IS READY TO RECEIVE THIS.
[ct=1200.182] >> RECOVERED BY THE KICKING
[ct=1200.863] TEAM, FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1204.512] KIRK: ANOTHER BREAK FOR NEW
[ct=1205.586] ORLEANS, THIS TIME SPECIAL TEAMS
[ct=1206.459] JUMPING ON THIS.
[ct=1209.304] AL: CAMPBELL RUNS RIGHT INTO
[ct=1210.541] HIM.
[ct=1214.703] TWO TURNOVERS IN THE
[ct=1220.218] AL: GOOD TO SEE THAT AGNEW IS
[ct=1220.794] OK, TROTS OFF.
[ct=1225.349] IS THIS A FAIR CATCH SIGNAL OR
[ct=1225.591] NOT?
[ct=1230.138] >> IT IS, BORDERLINE INVALID BUT
[ct=1231.279] IT HAS NO EFFECT ON THE PLAY
[ct=1233.242] BECAUSE THE TEAMMATE OF THE
[ct=1238.097] RECEIVING TEAM LAYER -- PLAYER
[ct=1238.980] IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED.
[ct=1240.303] IT IS ALL ON HIM.
[ct=1244.231] AL: THAT WAS THE CASE CLEARLY ON
[ct=1245.497] THIS SHORT DRIVE FROM THE RED
[ct=1245.770] ZONE.
[ct=1251.131] THE CARRY HERE FOR WILLIAMS, WHO
[ct=1253.443] LAST YEAR WAS WITH DETROIT.
[ct=1258.090] WILLIAMS THIS YEAR GAINED OVER
[ct=1261.186] 1000 YARDS WITH DETROIT, BUT
[ct=1263.692] SUCH A PREMIUM, OR NOT A PREMIUM
[ct=1265.634] ON RUNNING BACKS.
[ct=1268.830] YOU ARE OUT, WE WILL BRING OTHER
[ct=1269.444] GUYS IN.
[ct=1271.874] HE COMES DOWN HERE TO BACK UP
[ct=1272.752] KAMARA.
[ct=1275.712] SECOND AND 6.
[ct=1279.205] KAMARA STAYS IN BOUNDS, NICE
[ct=1279.472] MOVE.
[ct=1282.539] FIRST AND GOAL, TAKES IT DOWN TO
[ct=1286.297] THE 6-YARD LINE.
[ct=1289.632] KIRK: KNOWN FOR THE SCREEN GAME,
[ct=1290.845] IT HAS NOT BEEN IRKING WELL.
[ct=1293.557] TO SEE IT CALLED AT THE RIGHT
[ct=1293.856] TIME.
[ct=1297.482] THE RED ZONE HAS BEEN A DISASTER
[ct=1298.128] IN THE LAST COUPLE OF LOSSES.
[ct=1301.304] THEY HAD POSSESSIONS THAT ENDED
[ct=1305.266] AT HOUSTON'S 27, 11, 15, AND 24.
[ct=1307.564] THAT IS THEIR LAST FOUR
[ct=1310.445] POSSESSIONS, AND ONLY CAME AWAY
[ct=1311.713] WITH THREE POINTS.
[ct=1314.525] AL: SELF IMMOLATION.
[ct=1319.632] SHORT GAIN ONE OR TWO YARDS
[ct=1322.525] KAMARA MISSED THE FIRST THREE
[ct=1326.089] GAMES, SUSPENDED DUE TO THE
[ct=1326.646] PERSONAL CONDUCT POLICY.
[ct=1330.221] HE GOT INTO A BAD BRAWL IN LAS
[ct=1331.763] VEGAS LAST YEAR AND HAD TO SIT
[ct=1333.479] OUT THE FIRST THREE GAMES.
[ct=1338.690] KIRK: THEY WILL GO JUMBO HERE TO
[ct=1340.934] GET MORE OFFENSIVE LINEMEN IN.
[ct=1346.915] AL: SECOND DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=1355.138] GOOD PROTECTION.
[ct=1359.370] FINALLY HAS TO THROW, IT IS
[ct=1361.438] CAUGHT IN THE BACK OF THE END
[ct=1362.038] ZONE -- NO.
[ct=1367.056] SHAHEED WAS ABLE TO GET THERE,
[ct=1368.576] BUT COULD NOT STAY IN BOUNDS.
[ct=1372.279] IT LOOKED LIKE CARR WOULD THROW
[ct=1373.742] IT AWAY BUT THERE IS SHAHEED.
[ct=1377.002] KIRK: WHAT AN EFFORT, HE CLIMBED
[ct=1378.288] THE LADDER.
[ct=1381.757] THEY GO JUMBO MAKING THE JAGUARS
[ct=1385.230] DEFENSE INC. THEY WILL GO POWER
[ct=1385.785] AND RUN, AND INSTEAD THEY TRY TO
[ct=1388.857] GET OLAVE ISOLATED TO THE LEFT.
[ct=1391.898] HE ACTUALLY WENT DOWN, COVERED
[ct=1392.167] WELL.
[ct=1396.867] GOOD JOB BY SHAHEED TRYING TO
[ct=1397.537] KEEP THE PLAY ALIVE.
[ct=1400.026] AL: THIRD AND GOAL.
[ct=1402.255] THE RUNNING IS WILLIAMS.
[ct=1405.726] THE PASS IS BATTED AWAY IN THE
[ct=1410.626] THE BOO BIRDS ARE OUT AGAIN.
[ct=1414.941] BROWN BATTED IT AWAY, INTENDED
[ct=1415.421] FOR THOMAS.
[ct=1418.305] THEY CANNOT GET IN DOWN DEEP.
[ct=1421.524] KIRK: THIS IS WHO YOU WANT TO GO
[ct=1423.033] TO, MICHAEL THOMAS, 6â€™
[ct=1423.292] TO, MICHAEL THOMAS, 6'3".
[ct=1426.098] YOU KNOW WHAT HE DOES A GOOD JOB
[ct=1426.567] OF?
[ct=1429.842] HE HAS BEEN GETTING A LOT OF
[ct=1430.881] PRACTICE REPS.
[ct=1432.689] ANTICIPATING THE FADE.
[ct=1434.913] THE BALL NEEDED TO BE THROWN
[ct=1436.946] HIGHER TO GET IT TO THE TALLER
[ct=1437.672] RECEIVER.
[ct=1442.557] AL: BLAKE GRUPE, BANGS IT
[ct=1443.254] THROUGH.
[ct=1448.952] 1:26 REMAINING IN THE FIRST
[ct=1450.288] HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA.
[ct=1453.140] MEANWHILE, GOOD TO SEE AGNEW
[ct=1457.789] BACK AFTER TAKING THAT WHACK ON
[ct=1459.892] THE LAST ATTEMPTED PUNT RETURN.
[ct=1466.691] BLAKE GRUPE TO PUT IT IN THE
[ct=1467.582] AIR, THE FREE AGENT FROM NOTRE
[ct=1468.236] DAME.
[ct=1471.452] AGNEW WILL LET IT BOUNCE INTO
[ct=1472.205] THE END ZONE.
[ct=1474.736] KIRK: YOU GO BACK TO THE JAGSâ€™
[ct=1475.034] KIRK: YOU GO BACK TO THE JAGS'
[ct=1478.436] FIRST POSSESSION, EVERYTHING YOU
[ct=1478.699] WOULD WANT TO SEE.
[ct=1482.396] THE QUESTION WAS HOW WOULD
[ct=1483.296] TREVOR LAWRENCE AND HIS KNEE
[ct=1483.611] HOLD UP.
[ct=1486.249] THE FIRST DRIVE LOOKED GREAT.
[ct=1490.696] DELIVERING THE FOOTBALL TO SIX
[ct=1492.792] DIFFERENT JAGS ON THAT DRIVE.
[ct=1495.678] IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY
[ct=1497.727] BETTER.
[ct=1501.283] THEY CAME BACK ONLY TO HAVE A
[ct=1503.219] FUMBLE.
[ct=1511.286] AL: UP TO THE 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=1516.066] ETIENNE, LIKE LAWRENCE, WENT IN
[ct=1516.676] THE FIRST ROUND.
[ct=1521.216] THEY WERE CELEBRATING, AND THE
[ct=1523.693] NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE
[ct=1524.628] YOUR COLLEGE TEAMMATE COMING
[ct=1524.902] WITH.
[ct=1527.632] HE WAS EXCITED.
[ct=1530.146] KIRK: ALL THE HOOPLA AND
[ct=1532.526] CRAZINESS AND AFTER THE DRAFT
[ct=1533.484] YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT YOUR
[ct=1534.114] TEAMMATES, CRAZY.
[ct=1537.836] THEN HE FINDS OUT ETIENNE IS
[ct=1538.161] COMING WITH HIM.
[ct=1542.111] AL: HE HURT HIS FOOT IN HIS
[ct=1542.671] ROOKIE YEAR, DID NOT PLAY AT
[ct=1543.327] ALL.
[ct=1545.765] HAD A GOOD YEAR LAST YEAR.
[ct=1549.599] THE ROOKIE WILL TAKE THE BALL TO
[ct=1550.407] THE 32.
[ct=1552.951] THEY PICKED HIM IN THE THIRD
[ct=1553.601] ROUND OUT OF AUBURN.
[ct=1555.574] FINAL MINUTE OF THE FIRST
[ct=1555.902] QUARTER.
[ct=1558.430] IT IS THIRD DOWN AND 2.
[ct=1561.611] KIRK: BEING A ROOKIE, THEY HAVE
[ct=1563.832] EASED HIM MEN, ETIENNE HAS
[ct=1565.288] CARRIED THE LOAD.
[ct=1568.532] THE MORE AND MORE THE JACK CN
[ct=1572.602] TRUST BIGSBY, -- THE MORE A MORE
[ct=1577.208] THE JAGS SEE AND TRUST BIGSBY,
[ct=1577.770] HE CAN BE THE GO TO GUY.
[ct=1581.846] AL: ALREADY TWO TURNOVERS THAT
[ct=1583.855] RESULTED IN ONE FIELD GOAL AND
[ct=1586.404] ONE MISSED FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT.
[ct=1588.153] THIRD AND 3.
[ct=1593.145] LAWRENCE BOUNCING AROUND.
[ct=1594.115] HE IS PLAYING REALLY WELL.
[ct=1596.934] KAYLEE: HOW DO YOU SETTLE DOWN
[ct=1598.152] YOUR TEAM AFTER THE EARLY
[ct=1598.444] TURNOVERS?
[ct=1600.264] >> WE WILL BE FINE.
[ct=1603.559] MISS COMMUNICATION ON THE PUNT
[ct=1604.170] RETURN, IT GOT A LITTLE LOUD.
[ct=1609.863] THEN CHRISTIAN HAS TO BE SMART
[ct=1610.747] IN THAT SITUATION.
[ct=1618.241] AL: WE ARE BACK WITH A LITTLE
[ct=1620.511] TRICKERY HERE AS AGNEW MAKES THE
[ct=1621.137] CATCH.
[ct=1626.654] AGNEW COMING TO THE NEAR SIDE, A
[ct=1628.566] LITTLE RAZZLE-DAZZLE.
[ct=1630.879] EIGHT YARD GAIN AFTER ALL OF
[ct=1630.879] THAT.
[ct=1633.888] KIRK: I'M SO IMPRESSED WITH DOUG
[ct=1635.531] PEDERSON AND WHAT HE HAS BROUGHT
[ct=1636.493] TO THIS FRANCHISE.
[ct=1639.673] THERE WAS A LITTLE TURMOIL WHEN
[ct=1640.171] HE CAME IN.
[ct=1643.789] NOT JUST SUCCESS ON THE FIELD
[ct=1644.805] AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING BUT THE
[ct=1647.772] CULTURE AND THE WAY THE PLAYERS
[ct=1648.316] LEAD THE TEAM.
[ct=1649.298] HE IS DOING A HECKUVA JOB.
[ct=1652.774] AL: TREMENDOUS, GOT THEM TO THE
[ct=1653.681] PLAYOFFS LAST YEAR.
[ct=1658.615] WENT TO KANSAS CITY AND TOOK
[ct=1659.214] THEM TO THE WIRE.
[ct=1663.290] THEY PICK UP A FIRST DOWN HERE
[ct=1664.618] WITH ETIENNE.
[ct=1668.107] COACHING THE EAGLES TO THE ONLY
[ct=1670.282] SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP.
[ct=1675.518] KIRK: WHEN YOU WON THAT SUPER
[ct=1677.617] BOWL IN RECENT YEARS, YOU CATCH
[ct=1679.453] THEIR.
[ct=1680.018] THEY WANT TO FOLLOW YOU AND
[ct=1681.840] TRUST WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY, AND
[ct=1683.230] IT HAS WORKED OUT FOR THEM.
[ct=1686.337] AL: AT THE 48 YARD LINE.
[ct=1692.026] THAT DOES THE JOB, AND THERE
[ct=1693.450] GOES LAWRENCE AGAIN DOWN THE
[ct=1694.614] SIDELINE AND OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=1699.735] ONCE AGAIN, INSTINCTIVE, AS DOUG
[ct=1701.317] PEDERSON WAS TELLING KAYLEE.
[ct=1705.191] MEANWHILE, HE HAS CARRIED THE
[ct=1706.735] BALL TWICE FOR 34 YARDS.
[ct=1710.271] KIRK: THE INSTINCTS TO TAKE
[ct=1712.463] OVER, AND HE DID TELL US AS HE
[ct=1713.716] IS TESTING IT OUT --
[ct=1717.288] >> HOLDING, DEFENSE, #4.
[ct=1720.535] FIVE YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1723.689] KIRK: AS HE WAS TESTING IT, HE
[ct=1724.750] SAID RUNNING STRAIGHT DOES NOT
[ct=1725.147] BOTHER HIM.
[ct=1728.516] IN THE SCRAMBLES WE HAVE SEEN,
[ct=1729.127] IT IS NOT THE LATERAL MOVEMENT.
[ct=1733.358] THEY BLITZ, HE SEES THE HOLE AND
[ct=1733.796] TAKES OFF.
[ct=1736.923] HE DOES THE SMART THING AND GETS
[ct=1737.433] OUT OF THE BOUNDS.
[ct=1742.579] AT HIS SIZE, 6'5", HE COVERS A
[ct=1743.225] LOT OF GROUND.
[ct=1747.077] AL: SECOND-LONGEST RUN OF HIS
[ct=1747.847] CAREER, 26 YARDS.
[ct=1752.714] THE PENALTY WAS ON TAYLOR, IT
[ct=1753.019] WAS DECLINED.
[ct=1755.881] FIRST DOWN FROM THE 17 YARD
[ct=1758.641] A LITTLE FLIP.
[ct=1762.141] ETIENNE TAKES IT TO THE END
[ct=1765.726] TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=1773.172] MAN, OH MAN, HOW QUICKLY DO THEY
[ct=1774.902] GET IN?
[ct=1776.999] OF COURSE, THE CROWD ARE LETTING
[ct=1777.620] THE SAINTS KNOW IT.
[ct=1780.151] 17 YARDS.
[ct=1784.926] ETIENNE HAS FIVE TOUCHDOWNS IN
[ct=1785.532] HIS LAST THREE APPEARANCES.
[ct=1787.798] KIRK: YOU GET MOTION FROM
[ct=1788.987] CHRISTIAN KIRK.
[ct=1792.861] HE WILL SET UP TO THE LEFT, BUT
[ct=1793.804] WATCH THE DEFENSIVE RESPONSE.
[ct=1797.185] THE LITTLE FAKE HERE TO GO
[ct=1799.189] AROUND, AND THEY FLIP IT TO
[ct=1802.580] ETIENNE TO GET IN THE CORNER.
[ct=1813.276] AL: ETIENNE MAKE IT SIX CAMPERS
[ct=1815.517] TO THE END ZONE, TWO TONIGHT,
[ct=1817.267] TWO BACKS YOU WILL SEE, AND
[ct=1820.819] THIS JETS SWEEP OCCUPIES THE
[ct=1822.671] THEY START TO MOVE AND THEN YOU
[ct=1823.318] GET HIM TO THE CORNER.
[ct=1828.199] OVER 20 MILES AN HOUR, THE
[ct=1829.849] ACCELERATION, AND ONCE YOU TAKE
[ct=1831.833] ONE STEP AS AN AGGRESSIVE
[ct=1832.680] DEFENSE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION
[ct=1834.690] AND NUMBER WHAT IS GOING THE
[ct=1835.355] OTHER WAY, IT IS TOUGH TO CATCH
[ct=1836.073] UP.
[ct=1842.282] AL: TWO OR MORE TDS IN THREE
[ct=1846.068] STRAIGHT GAMES, FIRST IN
[ct=1846.332] FRANCHISE HISTORY.
[ct=1849.547] KAYLEE: CHRISTIAN KIRK TOLD ME
[ct=1851.707] ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IMPRESSES
[ct=1855.640] HIM ABOUT TRAVIS ETIENNE'S
[ct=1855.938] CONTACT BALANCE.
[ct=1857.681] YOU HAVE TO WRAP HIM UP, WHICH
[ct=1859.874] KIRK SAID WAS CRAZY BECAUSE THAT
[ct=1861.790] 5'10", 215, HE IS NOT THE
[ct=1863.949] BIGGEST BUT JUST A NATURAL.
[ct=1867.315] HE SAID IT SURPRISES PEOPLE HOW
[ct=1868.685] DURABLE HE IS AS HE BOUNCES OFF
[ct=1871.596] DEFENDERS AND GOES FROM ZERO TO
[ct=1874.346] 100 AND A SECOND.
[ct=1875.257] THAT IS WHAT MAKES THEM FUN TO
[ct=1875.257] WATCH.
[ct=1879.910] AL: WE MENTIONED BEFORE, HE
[ct=1881.122] MISSED HIS ENTIRE ROOKIE SEASON
[ct=1881.764] WITH A FOOT INJURY.
[ct=1887.186] AND HAS HAD A TERRIFIC START IN
[ct=1887.482] 2023.
[ct=1891.658] THAT THROW WAS CAUGHT AT THE
[ct=1892.624] 30-YARD LINE TO START ON THE
[ct=1892.927] FIVE YARD LINE.
[ct=1894.646] SHE HEâ€™
[ct=1895.320] SHE HE'D MAKING THE CATCH.
[ct=1897.468] HE IS AS FAST AS ANYBODY IN THE
[ct=1897.751] LEAGUE.
[ct=1899.564] KIRK: THE SAINTS HAVE HAD A
[ct=1902.654] TOUGH WEEK AFTER THAT LOSS IN
[ct=1904.320] THE WAY THEY LOST TO HOUSTON,
[ct=1905.052] AND THEY GET THE GAME STARTED
[ct=1907.963] BACK AT HOME, ONE TEAM TO KEEP
[ct=1908.982] THE CROWD ENGAGED AND THEY GET
[ct=1910.953] TWO TURNOVERS RIGHT AWAY.
[ct=1911.815] ABLE TO TURN THEM INTO THREE
[ct=1914.555] POINTS NOW THEY ARE DOWN 14-3.
[ct=1920.975] SECOND AND 5.
[ct=1925.346] CON AT THE 42ND YARD LINE.
[ct=1927.474] GETS IT TO MOREAU.
[ct=1930.538] JOHNSON IS THEIR NUMBER ONE
[ct=1932.223] TIGHT END, INACTIVE TONIGHT, SO
[ct=1933.617] MOREAU IS THE MAN.
[ct=1940.105] KIRK: YOU SEE 12 THERE,, TAKES
[ct=1940.678] THE CORNER WITH HIM.
[ct=1943.612] THE BALL HAD TO GET OUT EARLY,
[ct=1944.681] AND HE DOES A GOOD JOB OF
[ct=1948.841] ANTICIPATING FOR ANDRE CISCO AND
[ct=1949.505] JENKINS COME OVER TO MAKE A
[ct=1949.830] PLAY.
[ct=1957.264] AL: JAMAAL WILLIAMS TILDE 48
[ct=1957.538] YARD LINE.
[ct=1962.923] HE HAD A THREE-GAME SUSPENSION,
[ct=1965.707] AND ALSO, HE TOOK A LITTLE OF
[ct=1966.848] THE WORKLOAD AWAY FROM HIM BUT
[ct=1967.972] THEN HE GOT HURT, WILLIAMS DID,
[ct=1970.913] BUT AFTER MISSING THREE THROUGH
[ct=1971.200] FIVE.
[ct=1973.648] KIRK: ALL THESE YEARS, THEY HAVE
[ct=1975.684] ALWAYS HAD THAT THUNDER AND
[ct=1977.411] LIGHTNING TYPE OF BACK YIELDS,
[ct=1978.713] SO IT IS GOOD TO SEE WILLIAMS.
[ct=1979.158] BACK AND HEALTHY
[ct=1980.701] AL: SECOND AND 6.
[ct=1987.119] RIGHT SIDE HERE.
[ct=1988.514] WILLIAMS AGAIN.
[ct=1993.722] LLOYD STOPS HIM AT THE 45 YARD
[ct=1996.751] THIRD DOWN AND 3 FOR THE SAINTS.
[ct=2003.421] KIRK: THE LINE SHIFT, THEY
[ct=2005.124] BROUGHT IN FOUR OR FIVE
[ct=2005.887] DIFFERENT PLAYERS FOR THIS THIRD
[ct=2005.887] DOWN PLAY.
[ct=2009.869] AL:, SLIDE, HE IS IN THE --
[ct=2011.265] THOMAS IS IN THE SLOT.
[ct=2014.056] HILL IS IN THERE.
[ct=2026.607] AT 3.
[ct=2028.864] FIRES.
[ct=2032.766] BATTED AWAY AT THE LAST MOMENT.
[ct=2033.551] TRYING AGAIN TO THOMAS.
[ct=2038.068] IT IS DARIOUS WILLIAMS WHO WON A
[ct=2038.756] SUPER BOWL WITH THE RAMS TWO
[ct=2040.648] YEARS AGO.
[ct=2042.663] COMES OVER HERE, BATS IT AWAY,
[ct=2043.018] FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=2046.246] KIRK: THIRD DOWN AND 3, HE
[ct=2048.586] THOUGHT YOU WOULD SEE A CROSSER,
[ct=2050.832] BUT AFTER A LOT OF COMMUNICATION
[ct=2052.746] , A VERY LOW PERCENTAGE ROUTE
[ct=2053.694] DOWN THE FIELD TO THOMAS.
[ct=2057.134] GREAT TECHNIQUE BY WILLIAMS.
[ct=2060.257] AL: THEY LINE UP TO GO FOR THE
[ct=2061.265] FOURTH DOWN, AND THEY ARE GOING
[ct=2061.573] FOR IT.
[ct=2066.418] CARR THROWS.
[ct=2066.683] INCOMPLETE, GUIDED AWAY.
[ct=2072.948] DEVIN LLOYD GOT HIS HAND ON IT.
[ct=2075.871] INDICATION IS THE PENALTY IS
[ct=2080.756] AGAINST OLUOKUN.
[ct=2084.231] REFEREE: OFFENSE, NUMBER 13, A
[ct=2085.933] PENALTY.
[ct=2091.180] AL: THOMAS MISSED HIM, GOT THE
[ct=2091.812] BALL IN THE AIR MIDFIELD.
[ct=2095.670] 10:43 TO THE HALF.
[ct=2101.087] IT IS0-2 IN THE DOME, BUT, SO FA
[ct=2101.567] GOOD TONIGHT.
[ct=2106.143] RIGHT NOW, HE HAS A FIRST AND 10
[ct=2107.236] GETTING THIS DRIVE AFTER A
[ct=2107.566] TURNOVER.
[ct=2109.959] HE IS NOT VERY GOOD BELOW SEA
[ct=2110.347] LEVEL.
[ct=2112.935] KIRK: YEAH, UNFORTUNATELY.
[ct=2116.059] I CALLED BOTH THOSE LOSSES WHEN
[ct=2119.226] HE WAS IN COLLEGE, AND HE WAS
[ct=2122.242] ALWAYS IN COMMAND AND IN
[ct=2123.438] CONTROL, KIND OF LIKE WHAT WE
[ct=2124.183] ARE SEEING TONIGHT, EVEN WITH
[ct=2126.903] THAT KNEE HURTING.
[ct=2130.367] THEY PUT TOGETHER A HECK OF A
[ct=2132.481] PLAN, PETERSON IMPRESSED TAYLOR.
[ct=2133.475] AL: THE BALL IS OUT QUICK.
[ct=2136.717] CANNOT HELP HIMSELF.
[ct=2137.785] WE HAVE SEEN A COUPLE OF THOSE
[ct=2137.785] SCRAMBLES.
[ct=2140.246] IT HAS BEEN OBVIOUS.
[ct=2144.801] DRIFTING AROUND ON DEFENSE.
[ct=2147.216] FOUR MEN RUSH.
[ct=2149.619] RIGHT INTO THE AIR, INCOMPLETE.
[ct=2152.835] THAT IS ON CAM JORDAN, WHO IS IN
[ct=2156.766] HIS 13TH SEASON WITH A BAD THIRD
[ct=2159.296] DOWN, SO CAM AND HIS FATHER, OF
[ct=2161.830] THE GREAT TIGHT END FOR
[ct=2162.479] MINNESOTA, HE PLAYED 13 YEARS.
[ct=2165.998] CAM SAYS ONE MORE?
[ct=2166.349] TWO MORE.
[ct=2168.906] KIRK: HE SAID, I HAVE AT LEAST
[ct=2168.906] TWO.
[ct=2170.693] AL: IN GREAT SHAPE.
[ct=2174.118] KIRK: GREAT AGAINST A RUN AND
[ct=2175.177] STILL AN EXPLOSIVE PLAYER.
[ct=2180.468] AL: THIRD AND 10.
[ct=2190.261] SENDING IN AN EXTRA MAN.
[ct=2191.268] PASSES INCOMPLETE.
[ct=2192.304] THAT PUSHES THE PRESSURE ON
[ct=2193.496] LAWRENCE.
[ct=2194.464] HE COULD NOT RECONNECT.
[ct=2198.176] PUTTING THE HEAT ON IN HIS
[ct=2201.793] KIRK: THEY BROUGHT PRESSURE AND
[ct=2203.096] PLAYED ZONE BEHIND, CONFUSING
[ct=2203.867] THE OFFENSIVE LINE UP FRONT.
[ct=2206.816] AND THESE DEFENSIVE ENDS, IF
[ct=2209.280] THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO AFFECT THE
[ct=2209.996] GAME, IT IS ON THIRD DOWN
[ct=2211.626] SITUATIONS.
[ct=2216.603] WINS ON THE LEFT SIDE AGAINST
[ct=2217.350] ROBBERSON ENFORCED THE BALL OUT
[ct=2217.350] EARLY.
[ct=2220.248] AL: LOGAN COOKE, HIS FIRST PUNT
[ct=2220.641] OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=2225.050] SHAHEED IS BACK TO RECEIVE IT.
[ct=2228.615] HE CAN FLY IF HE GETS ROOM, BUT
[ct=2229.423] HE HAS TO PULL UP WITH A FAIR
[ct=2232.352] LET'S SEE IF THE SAINTS CAN
[ct=2235.222] MUSTER SOMETHING OFFENSIVELY.
[ct=2237.339] THEY RUN 24 PLAYS FROM 90 YARDS.
[ct=2240.961] LESS THAN 40 YARDS PER PLAY.
[ct=2249.441] KIRK: THE ONE FIELD GOAL THEY
[ct=2250.156] HAD, THEY STARTED AT THE 13 YARD
[ct=2257.208] AL: WOULD LOVE TO GET IT BACK
[ct=2257.827] AFTER JACKSONVILLE.
[ct=2259.422] GOES OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=2261.663] A LOT OF ROOM TO RUN.
[ct=2269.364] FIRST DOWN IS PICKED UP, SO 22
[ct=2270.387] AFTER THE 35.
[ct=2272.157] KIRK: ANYTIME YOU SEE A
[ct=2273.857] QUARTERBACK IN THE NATIONAL
[ct=2276.199] FOOTBALL LEAGUE EXECUTING WELL
[ct=2277.763] AND PLAYING WITH CONFIDENCE IT
[ct=2279.230] IS BECAUSE HE HAS ANSWERS.
[ct=2279.892] RIGHT NOW WHEN YOU WATCH DEREK
[ct=2281.619] CARR, HE IS LEARNING A NEW
[ct=2284.277] OFFENSE, LEARNING WITH ME
[ct=2286.966] RECEIVERS, OFTEN TIMES, IT LOOKS
[ct=2288.668] LIKE HE IS UNSURE.
[ct=2293.384] AND THAT HAS BEEN PRETTY EVIDENT
[ct=2294.091] OF ANY THROWS HE HAS MADE.
[ct=2297.766] AL: STUCK IN THE BACKFIELD RIGHT
[ct=2297.766] THERE.
[ct=2301.204] AND THEN YOU HAVE GOT A FLAG
[ct=2301.573] DOWN THERE.
[ct=2304.511] IT IS ONE THING TO STOP WHEN THE
[ct=2306.414] WHISTLE BLOWS, AND IT IS ANOTHER
[ct=2307.910] TO THROW A WRESTLING MOVE I GET
[ct=2310.450] THE PENALTY HERE -- AND GET THE
[ct=2311.674] PENALTY HERE.
[ct=2317.659] REFEREE: AFTER THE PLAY,
[ct=2318.404] PERSONAL FOUL, UNNECESSARY
[ct=2322.155] ROUGHNESS, DEFENSE, NUMBER 90,
[ct=2322.453] 15-YARD PENALTY.
[ct=2325.528] KIRK: HE COULD NOT HAVE PLAYED
[ct=2327.040] IT BETTER WITH A SWIM TECHNIQUE
[ct=2327.767] OFF THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=2330.506] PETERSON SAYS, USE OUR HEAD.
[ct=2332.959] HE GETS INTO THE BACKFIELD ON
[ct=2333.793] THE WHISTLE IS ALREADY BLOWN AND
[ct=2335.444] BODY SLAMS KAMARA INTO THE
[ct=2335.912] GROUND.
[ct=2340.872] AL: I EVEN KNOW HOW HE CAN -- I
[ct=2341.693] DO NOT EVEN KNOW HOW HE CAN
[ct=2342.204] STATE HIS CASE THERE.
[ct=2351.736] JUST A LITTLE GAME, FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2355.496] UP AT THE 47 YARD LINE.
[ct=2363.838] THIS IS SHAHEED ON THE SLOT BACK
[ct=2367.273] AROUND, CHECKING IN WITH KAYLEE.
[ct=2370.748] KAYLEE: DENNIS ALLEN SAID THIS
[ct=2371.680] WEEK THAT COMMUNICATION HAS TO
[ct=2372.892] BE BETTER ON THE SAINTS OFFENSE
[ct=2373.883] BUT WHEN I TALKED TO MICHAEL
[ct=2376.456] THOMAS, HE WANTED TO CLARIFY AND
[ct=2378.169] SAID I DO NOT WANT TO POINT
[ct=2379.895] FINGERS -- NUMBER 70 IS
[ct=2381.289] ELIGIBLE.
[ct=2384.847] KAYLEE: AVIATORS COMMUNICATION
[ct=2386.452] ON ONE OR TWO PLAYS BUT NOT
[ct=2389.140] COMMUNICATION -- HE SAID MAYBE
[ct=2390.234] IT IS COMMUNICATION ONE ARE TWO
[ct=2390.946] PLAYS BUT NOT COMMUNICATION.
[ct=2394.106] HE SAID THEY HAVE TO FOCUS ON
[ct=2394.402] MAKING PLAYS.
[ct=2396.627] AL: THEY HAVE TO FOCUS ON
[ct=2399.846] GETTING SOMETHING STARTED, PLAY
[ct=2405.652] ACTION PAST AND KAMARA WITH A
[ct=2406.298] NICE TACKLE, DARIOUS WILLIAMS,
[ct=2408.751] PLAYED WITH THE RAMS, CAME OVER
[ct=2411.648] HERE AND HAS THAT SUPER BOWL
[ct=2413.263] RING AND THEIR VICTORY OVER
[ct=2413.610] CINCINNATI AFTER THE 2021
[ct=2414.504] SEASON.
[ct=2416.775] KIRK: WHAT IS AMAZING ABOUT
[ct=2419.280] WILLIAMS, KAMARA AFTER THAT HIT,
[ct=2420.609] OFF THE SIDELINE -- WHAT IS
[ct=2421.846] AMAZING ABOUT WILLIAMS, HE IS A
[ct=2425.410] GUY WHO REALLY HAS BEEN MORE OF
[ct=2427.275] A SPOT CORNER.
[ct=2430.995] HE HAS FOUND A HOME AND PLAYS
[ct=2431.726] WITH GOOD VISION ON THE
[ct=2432.182] PERIMETER OF THE DEFENSE.
[ct=2435.289] AL: KAMARA ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=2437.083] WILLIAMS IS BACK IN, THIRD DOWN
[ct=2437.789] AND 3.
[ct=2441.009] BATTED AWAY AGAIN.
[ct=2444.993] LOOKING FOR A FLAG BUT THERE IS
[ct=2444.993] NONE.
[ct=2447.287] HE IS THERE ON HIS FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=2449.641] KIRK: ON THIRD DOWN, THEY ARE
[ct=2452.356] NOT FEELING THREATENED
[ct=2455.993] DOWNFIELD, SO HE SETTLES AT THE
[ct=2457.515] TOP OF THE ROUTE AND EXPECTS
[ct=2458.669] THIS BALL TO BE COMING OUT.
[ct=2460.987] HE HAS THE ABILITY TO GO BY BUT
[ct=2462.661] THERE IS A FIRST DOWN MARKER.
[ct=2464.683] REALLY GOOD JOB OF JUST THE
[ct=2465.851] SITUATIONAL AWARENESS BUYER SLOT
[ct=2466.258] CORNER.
[ct=2470.939] JUST BEING SMART, DOES NOT
[ct=2471.746] INTERFERE AND KNOCKS THE BALL
[ct=2472.098] AWAY.
[ct=2476.181] AL: ON THE MOVE.
[ct=2477.862] AT THE 18 YARD LINE, HOLDING BY
[ct=2479.019] AGNEW.
[ct=2482.121] 7:17 REMAINING IN THE FIRST
[ct=2482.447] HALF.
[ct=2484.517] 14-3, JAGUARS.
[ct=2489.573] MAYFIELD GAVE US THAT
[ct=2492.134] PERFORMANCE ON THURSDAY NIGHT IN
[ct=2494.931] L.A. LAST YEAR WHEN HE LED THE
[ct=2497.769] TEAM TO A FANTASTIC DRAMATIC
[ct=2498.511] DRIVE AT THE END OF THE GAME TO
[ct=2498.896] BE THE RAIDERS.
[ct=2501.525] KIRK: READING THE OFFENSE,
[ct=2504.826] TRYING TO LEARN THE SYSTEM AS
[ct=2505.110] BEST HE COULD.
[ct=2508.336] HE SHOWED UP WITH A WRISTBAND
[ct=2508.975] AND ENDED UP FINDING A WAY TO
[ct=2509.315] WIN.
[ct=2512.036] AL: WHAT A NIGHT, AND NOW HE IS
[ct=2513.227] THE MAN IN TAMPA.
[ct=2515.006] THEY ARE OFF TO A DECENT START.
[ct=2516.753] WE SEE THEM NEXT WEEK IN BUFFALO
[ct=2517.515] ON THURSDAY.
[ct=2519.355] SWEET PASS HERE, MOVING TO THE
[ct=2519.779] INSIDE.
[ct=2521.530] ETIENNE PICKS UP ABOUT EIGHT.
[ct=2523.911] THE JAGUARS ARE ON THEIR WAY.
[ct=2527.020] THEY HOPE -- YOU KNOW, WE
[ct=2528.840] MENTIONED AT THE START, THE
[ct=2530.632] SAINTS ARE SEEN SOME GOOD AND
[ct=2532.565] SOME BAD, EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN.
[ct=2535.273] SO FAR, THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
[ct=2535.583] A WAY TO GET TOGETHER
[ct=2535.936] OFFENSIVELY.
[ct=2537.818] KIRK: I THINK THEY'RE HOPING THE
[ct=2539.428] REASON THEY PUNT HERE, THEY TRY
[ct=2542.640] TO RELY ON THEIR DEFENSE BEFORE
[ct=2543.360] THE HALF TO GET THE BALL BACK.
[ct=2547.042] THERE OFFENSE, -- IT IS LIKE WE
[ct=2547.402] ARE STUCK.
[ct=2550.466] THEY ARE NOT QUITE ABLE TO GET
[ct=2551.540] THIS GOING.
[ct=2554.744] A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL ABILITY,
[ct=2555.596] JUST NOT QUITE CLICKING YET.
[ct=2560.981] AL: THE CROWD GETS IMPATIENT
[ct=2561.983] BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DECADE AND A
[ct=2563.109] HALF OF SEAN PAYTON AND DREW
[ct=2564.627] BREES.
[ct=2565.547] THEY ARE NOT USED TO SEEING
[ct=2566.506] KIRK: NO.
[ct=2570.897] AND MANY YEARS OF THIS OFFENSE
[ct=2572.749] BEING LOOKED AT AS ONE OF THE
[ct=2573.409] BEST IN THE NFL.
[ct=2577.491] DREW BREES REALLY SPOILED THEM.
[ct=2579.742] THEY HAD A LOT OF TALENT AROUND
[ct=2580.117] WITHDREW.
[ct=2580.543] GREAT TO SEE HIM HERE TONIGHT.
[ct=2587.160] BUT, YEAH, IT IS A TALENT THAT
[ct=2590.314] IS USED TO OFFENSIVE PRODUCTION
[ct=2591.434] AND PUT BIG POINTS ON THE BOARD.
[ct=2595.307] AL: THIRD AND 3.
[ct=2600.031] RECEIVER TO THE LEFT.
[ct=2601.114] GO THAT WAY.
[ct=2604.372] WE MAKE THE GRAB ALONG THE
[ct=2604.735] SIDELINE.
[ct=2610.454] -- AGNEW MAKES THE GRAB ALONG
[ct=2611.741] THE SIDELINE AND OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=2618.345] KIRK: HE WAS ABLE TO, YOU KNOW,
[ct=2619.277] WITH SOFTER COVERAGE FROM
[ct=2621.949] LATTIMORE ON THIRD DOWN, HE
[ct=2624.133] TRUSTS HIS INSTINCTS SO MUCH
[ct=2625.182] THAT HE THINKS HE CAN DRIVE ON
[ct=2625.182] THE BALL.
[ct=2628.493] THE BALL IS JUST THROWN WHERE
[ct=2629.109] AGNEW CANNOT MAKE A PLAY ON IT.
[ct=2631.099] AL: INCOMPLETE, FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=2632.152] PUNT.
[ct=2633.631] LOGAN COOKE.
[ct=2639.208] ANOTHER FAIR CATCH.
[ct=2642.700] PLAYING HIS THROW, SO YOU HAVE
[ct=2644.794] SHAHEED CALLING FOR THE CATCH.
[ct=2647.240] YOU HAVE ON TONIO JOHNSON
[ct=2650.457] RUNNING INTO HIM -- ANTONIO
[ct=2651.525] JOHNSON RUNNING INTO HIM, SO YOU
[ct=2652.210] KNOW WHAT THAT PENALTY IS GOING
[ct=2652.640] TO BE.
[ct=2657.014] AND WE WILL HEAR FROM LANDON
[ct=2657.708] CLARK IN A MOMENT.
[ct=2661.293] ALL KINDS OF STUFF GOING ON IN
[ct=2661.897] THESE HERE CATCHES TONIGHT.
[ct=2665.841] -- FAIR CATCHES TONIGHT.
[ct=2668.590] KIRK: THE LATE FAIR CATCH NOT
[ct=2669.182] IMPACT THIS AT ALL.
[ct=2671.814] JOHNSON RUNS RIGHT INTO HIM.
[ct=2672.112] IT IS A FOUL.
[ct=2678.798] REFEREE: INTERFERENCE WITH THE
[ct=2679.408] OPPORTUNITY TO CATCH A KICK.
[ct=2683.322] NUMBER 26, KICKING TEAM.
[ct=2683.744] 15 YARD PENALTY.
[ct=2686.579] KIRK: THE IDEA TO PUNT THAT BALL
[ct=2691.220] AWAY ON FOURTH AND 3 WORKS OUT.
[ct=2693.574] THE DEFENSE IS THEIR JOB.
[ct=2695.874] NOW AFTER THAT PENALTY, THEY ARE
[ct=2697.059] GOING TO BE STARTING THIS NEXT
[ct=2698.844] POSSESSION IN PLUS TERRITORY.
[ct=2705.053] AL: 35 YARD PUNT, 20 NETTED AT
[ct=2706.246] THE END OF THE DAY AFTER THE
[ct=2709.960] IN THE BALL OF THE JAGUARS, 36
[ct=2712.770] YARD LINE, 5:41 UNTIL THE HALF.
[ct=2720.855] KAMARA BACK IN.
[ct=2732.788] GETS IT TO KAMARA.
[ct=2738.105] BUNCH OF WHITE SHIRTS SURROUND
[ct=2739.116] HIM, TAKES IT TO THE 43 YARD
[ct=2741.333] KIRK: THEY ARE PLAYING A DEEP
[ct=2744.676] TWO DEEP SAFETIES, IT'LL BACK
[ct=2747.572] FIELD GETTING DOWNFIELD --
[ct=2750.470] MIDDLE BACK FIELD GETTING
[ct=2750.763] DOWNFIELD.
[ct=2751.505] THE OPTION MANY TIMES IS GETTING
[ct=2751.863] DOWN TO KAMARA.
[ct=2755.194] ONLY TWO PERCEPTIONS ON THE
[ct=2755.535] NIGHT, 17 YARDS.
[ct=2757.071] THOMAS DOES NOT HAVE A
[ct=2757.465] RECEPTION.
[ct=2760.558] JAGS HAVE TAKEN MOST LOOKS
[ct=2760.868] DOWNFIELD AWAY.
[ct=2765.285] AL: NINE AND 18, 80 YARDS TOTAL.
[ct=2768.728] KAMARA AGAIN.
[ct=2772.337] HE GETS STUCK AT THE 42 YARD
[ct=2777.180] KAMARA RIGHT NOW HAS CARRIED THE
[ct=2777.573] BALL.
[ct=2781.818] SEVEN CARRIES, EIGHT YARDS.
[ct=2785.085] KIRK: THE BOOK WOULD TELL YOU
[ct=2786.242] AGAINST A TEAM PLAYING A LOT OF
[ct=2788.083] ZONE, YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO RUN
[ct=2789.103] THE FOOTBALL WITH TWO SAFETIES
[ct=2791.447] THAT ARE BACK BUT WITH THIS
[ct=2792.768] MAKESHIFT OFFENSE OF LINE, IT
[ct=2793.385] PUTS THEM IN A TOUGH SPOT.
[ct=2796.824] THAT IS WHY THEY CANNOT GET TO
[ct=2797.523] DEVIN LLOYD, THE BACKER.
[ct=2814.195] AL: CARR UNDER PRESSURE, GETS IT
[ct=2826.443] CARR FRUSTRATED, LAST WEEK, HE
[ct=2826.808] SAID HE WAS LIVID.
[ct=2827.900] FOURTH DOWN AND 3.
[ct=2830.393] LAST TIME THEY WERE IN THIS
[ct=2832.360] AREA, THEY WENT FOR IT TAN THEY
[ct=2833.233] LEAVE THE OFFENSE OUT THERE
[ct=2833.692] AGAIN.
[ct=2837.875] KIRK: AND, SPATIAL PRESSURE,
[ct=2839.452] JUST BRINGING IT FORWARD, YOU
[ct=2841.730] EXPECT 41, JOSH ALLEN TO BE A
[ct=2842.204] FACTOR ON THESE PASSING DOWN'S.
[ct=2844.079] HE IS LIGHT UP TO THE OFFENSEâ€™
[ct=2844.268] HE IS LIGHT UP TO THE OFFENSE'
[ct=2844.877] LEFT.
[ct=2847.198] THEY HAVE A GOOD PUSH IN THE
[ct=2847.644] MIDDLE THAT TIME, TOO.
[ct=2858.652] AL: FOURTH AND 3.
[ct=2860.370] GETS IT AWAY.
[ct=2863.241] JUST BEFORE HE GETS HIT, KAMARA
[ct=2865.956] MAKES THE CATCH AND PICKS UP THE
[ct=2868.958] GIVES THE CROWD SOMETHING TO GET
[ct=2869.345] EXCITED ABOUT.
[ct=2872.094] KIRK: HE GOT THAT OUT JUST IN
[ct=2876.341] TIME BECAUSE PETE TO, THE LEFT
[ct=2878.221] TACKLE, GOING UP AGAINST JOSH
[ct=2878.693] ALLEN WITH SEVEN SACKS ON THE
[ct=2881.846] YEAR, JUST IN TIME BEFORE HE
[ct=2882.744] GETS BLOWN UP ON THAT FOURTH
[ct=2882.744] DOWN.
[ct=2886.155] WE HAVE SEEN KAMARA WORK, SHAKE
[ct=2889.203] IT UP TO THE MIDDLE, AND THAT
[ct=2890.199] TIME HE WORKS TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=2893.749] CARR WAS LUMPED IN AND WE SAW
[ct=2894.960] THAT MATCHUP AGAINST THE
[ct=2895.181] LINEBACKER.
[ct=2898.978] AL: WILLIAMS TAKES INTO THE 20
[ct=2902.559] . BRICKS AND
[ct=2903.866] THE TACKLE UNDER THREE MINUTES
[ct=2904.560] TO PLAY IN THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=2908.007] KIRK: IT IS REALLY AN EXTENSION
[ct=2910.420] OF MIKE CALDWELL, LIKE DEFENSIVE
[ct=2911.871] COORDINATOR OUT ON THE FIELD.
[ct=2913.690] HE AND DEVIN LLOYD ARE HAVING
[ct=2916.443] GREAT GAMES, IF THEY ARE GETTING
[ct=2918.847] DOWNHILL IN A HURRY, AND THEN
[ct=2920.389] BEING INVOLVED IN THE PAST GAME,
[ct=2922.899] WHERE THEY ARE DROPPING THE ZONE
[ct=2923.938] AND THEN RALLYING TO THE THROWS
[ct=2924.290] UNDERNEATH THEM.
[ct=2925.967] AL: SECOND AND 8.
[ct=2932.662] EXTRA PRESSURE.
[ct=2934.120] FIRED.
[ct=2935.801] INCOMPLETE.
[ct=2938.611] CUTTING ACROSS OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=2941.038] MAKING IT THIRD DOWN AND 8.
[ct=2946.643] KIRK: HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF
[ct=2947.508] WHERE YOU ARE STILL SEEING CARR
[ct=2950.698] AND HIS RECEIVERS, WHO ARE
[ct=2952.487] GIFTED, STILL WORKING IT OUT AS
[ct=2953.282] FAR AS THE TIMING.
[ct=2955.120] CARRCARR FEELS TO ME THAT IS
[ct=2958.132] EXPECTING -- FEELS TO ME THAT
[ct=2960.357] CARR IS EXPECTING HIM TO WORK
[ct=2960.660] MORE HERE THAN DOWN.
[ct=2962.824] IT WAS THROWN A LITTLE BIT MORE
[ct=2967.079] TO THE OUTSIDE, AND SLIGHTLY OFF
[ct=2967.394] ON THE TIMING.
[ct=2969.405] AL: GOOD POINT.
[ct=2969.671] THIRD DOWN AND 8.
[ct=2975.912] EXTRA MAN COMES.
[ct=2979.067] ? CANDY GET TO THE FIRST DOWN
[ct=2982.997] CANNOT -- CAN HE GET TO THE
[ct=2983.371] FIRST DOWN?
[ct=2984.472] CANNOT.
[ct=2987.662] CARR DOES NOT WANT TO SEE THE
[ct=2988.630] FIELD GOAL UNIT COME IN.
[ct=2992.245] HE WANTS TO GO FOR IT, BUT ALAN
[ct=2992.801] HAS OTHER IDEAS.
[ct=2993.998] SO DOES THE CROWD.
[ct=3004.540] WE HAVE REACHED THE 20-MINUTE
[ct=3008.448] WARNING IN NEW ORLEANS ON THIS
[ct=3008.776] THURSDAY NIGHT.
[ct=3010.192] JAGUARS UP TO 11.
[ct=3014.206] MOST ALL JACKSONVILLE, TRYING
[ct=3015.205] TO MAKE IT.
[ct=3019.525] FIVE FIELD YARD ATTEMPT.
[ct=3021.876] MADE ONE, MISSED ONE.
[ct=3027.456] GETS THAT WHEN DOWN THE MIDDLE.
[ct=3034.296] 14 TO SIX, 1:57.
[ct=3040.729] NO TEAM HAS STARTED 6-0 FOR THE
[ct=3044.564] FIRST TIME SINCE 2017, WITH THE
[ct=3046.735] EAGLES AND NINERS LOSING SUNDAY.
[ct=3049.418] THE LIONS, FIRST TIME SINCE
[ct=3053.056] 1993, BEST RECORD IN THE NFL,
[ct=3056.357] LATE INTO THE SEASON, EVERYTHING
[ct=3056.969] GOING SWIMMINGLY IN THE MOTOR
[ct=3062.469] CITY, AND 15 RUSHING TDS, 15
[ct=3065.057] RUSHING TDS -- PASSING TDS.
[ct=3068.614] 1958 BALTIMORE COLTS, WHO BEAT
[ct=3071.224] THE GIANTS, IN MAYBE ONE OF THE
[ct=3073.897] GREAT GAMES EVER PLAYED, AND ONE
[ct=3075.772] OF THE FIRST EVER OVERTIME GAME,
[ct=3077.171] BEAT THE GIANTS IN KIRK: KIRK:
[ct=3078.806] THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.
[ct=3080.942] WHAT A GAME WITH MIAMI AND
[ct=3081.212] PHILLY THIS WEEK.
[ct=3085.044] IT WILL BE A LOT OF FUN TO SEE
[ct=3086.397] HOW THOSE TWO TEAMS COLLIDE.
[ct=3092.010] AL: 14-6, THE JAGUARS ON TOP.
[ct=3100.540] AND STARTING FROM THE 25.
[ct=3106.264] NOW WEFROM THE 25 YARD LINE, JAG
[ct=3107.776] BEGIN THIS RIDE WITH A PASS TO
[ct=3108.187] THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=3111.084] PRETTY CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3115.278] KIRK MAKING THE CATCH HERE,
[ct=3118.777] TAYLOR NOXON OUT OF BOUNDS. --
[ct=3119.420] KNOCKS HIM OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=3122.421] KIRK: WITH THE ABILITY OF TREVOR
[ct=3123.864] LAWRENCE AND THE WEAPONS HE HAS
[ct=3126.040] ON THE FACTS THAT THE SAINTS GET
[ct=3126.942] THE BALL TO START THE SECOND
[ct=3127.524] HALF, THEY'RE GOING TO TURN IT
[ct=3129.464] UP AND TRY TO PUT POINTS ON THE
[ct=3129.759] BOARD.
[ct=3147.930] AL: ON THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=3152.615] FIRST DOWN, TWO PASSES, TWO
[ct=3156.025] FIRST DOWNS, INGRAM HAS MADE
[ct=3156.025] THREE TONIGHT.
[ct=3158.903] KIRK: YOU LOOK AT HIM AS A TIGHT
[ct=3162.547] END, BUT TECHNICALLY, WHAT A
[ct=3165.156] VALUABLE COMMODITY HE IS, WERE
[ct=3167.442] YOU CAN FLEX HIM OUT WITH REALLY
[ct=3168.384] A BIGGER WIDE RECEIVER WHEN YOU
[ct=3171.121] WATCH HIM RUN HIS ROUNDS, 6'3",
[ct=3174.920] 240 POUNDS, AND JONES GETS BACK
[ct=3175.897] AND HE IS PLAYING AS MUCH
[ct=3181.343] RECEIVER AS HE CAN AT TIGHT END.
[ct=3188.703] AL: FLAG HERE.
[ct=3192.539] REFEREE: FALSE START.
[ct=3193.963] OFFENSE, NUMBER 17.
[ct=3195.946] FIVE YARD PENALTY.
[ct=3201.263] AL: IT IS ON INGRAM -- ENGRAM.
[ct=3206.564] KIRK: PETERSON HAS TO BE PRETTY
[ct=3206.855] EXCITED WITH WHAT HE HAS SEEN
[ct=3208.537] HIS OFFENSE THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=3211.570] SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT TREVOR
[ct=3212.822] LAWRENCE, HIS KNEE, WOULD HE
[ct=3213.185] PLAY?
[ct=3217.686] WENT OUT TO THE PREGAME WARM-UP
[ct=3219.552] TO SEE HOW HE WOULD FEEL AND
[ct=3220.703] WORE A BRACE HIS FIRST TIME IN
[ct=3223.998] HIS CAREER AT COLLEGE OR THE
[ct=3224.613] PROS AND EXECUTED PRETTY WELL.
[ct=3227.920] AL: HE IS A LEADING RUSHER IN
[ct=3228.797] THE GAME, 35 YARDS.
[ct=3231.593] YOU KNOW WHAT IS INTERESTING IS
[ct=3234.525] THAT THIS TEAM IS ONLY GOING TO
[ct=3235.206] PLAY ONE GAME IN THE NEXT 23
[ct=3235.586] DAYS.
[ct=3239.496] THEY HAVE TO MANY BYE COMING UP
[ct=3240.079] AND THEN THEY HAVE THE REAL ONE.
[ct=3242.825] AND HE LOOKED AT THIS AND SAID,
[ct=3244.550] YOU KNOW, LET'S LET HIM REST.
[ct=3249.147] KIRK: IF YOU WOULD HAVE HAD ANY
[ct=3251.274] KIND OF FEELING IN THE PREGAME
[ct=3253.017] WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK,
[ct=3254.980] LET'S LET HIM REST, I THINK ALL
[ct=3255.899] INDICATIONS WERE HE FEELS GOOD,
[ct=3257.104] LET'S TURN HIM LOOSE.
[ct=3259.261] AL: SECOND AND 4.
[ct=3269.551] ETIENNE THE INTENDED RECEIVER,
[ct=3276.741] CHASED BY ANOTHER CLEMSON
[ct=3279.615] ITE.
[ct=3282.127] KIRK: HE JUST HEARD THE STORY
[ct=3283.029] ABOUT BRIAN.
[ct=3286.480] YOU SEE HE TURNED HIS HEAD REAL
[ct=3287.097] QUICK TO LOOK AT TREVOR
[ct=3290.651] LAWRENCE, LIKE, I GOT YOU ON
[ct=3291.478] THAT ONE.
[ct=3294.347] AL: INDEED.
[ct=3308.946] CAUGHT LEAPING FOR IT SHORT OF
[ct=3309.529] THE FIRST.
[ct=3312.615] AGNEW, FOURTH DOWN AND A COUPLE.
[ct=3321.662] THEY MAKE THE TACKLEKIRK: WE HAV
[ct=3322.980] MAKE MANY PLAYS.
[ct=3324.544] HE WAS FRUSTRATED BY THIS HOLD
[ct=3325.442] BY THE ROOKIE.
[ct=3326.014] NO CALL.
[ct=3335.612] AL: FORFEND 2 -- FOURTH AND 2.
[ct=3336.385] A FAKE AND A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3339.943] COOKE THROWS A TO TIM JONES!
[ct=3346.870] MAINLY A SPECIAL TEAMS GUY, BUT
[ct=3348.139] CAN PLAY RECEIVER.
[ct=3351.541] HE HAD THREE RECEPTIONS COMING
[ct=3351.774] INTO THE GAME.
[ct=3354.808] THERE IS 4, 13 YARDS ON THE
[ct=3355.371] WORTH AND2.
[ct=3357.633] KIRK: WATCH HIM OUT THERE
[ct=3360.060] AGAINST HIM.
[ct=3362.969] HE LOSES HIM, TURNS HIS HEAD.
[ct=3364.208] WHEN HE TURNS AROUND, HE IS
[ct=3366.478] CATCHING A FOOTBALL.
[ct=3367.981] CATCHES HIM OFF GUARD.
[ct=3369.824] HE GAVE THE LOOK LIKE I AM
[ct=3370.622] COMING TO YOU.
[ct=3373.829] AL: FROM THE 33 YARD LINE.
[ct=3376.420] LAWRENCE FIRES.
[ct=3382.612] FROM 26 GOES ENGRAM, SECOND DOWN
[ct=3383.817] AND A TIMEOUT TAKEN HERE.
[ct=3386.615] KIRK: DOUG PEDERSON OF
[ct=3389.779] JACKSONVILLE, THE TIMING OF THAT
[ct=3390.643] AND EVERYBODY IS THINKING, THEY
[ct=3393.336] ARE UP 14 AND 6.
[ct=3396.497] HE IS ALWAYS WILLING TO TAKE
[ct=3398.011] CALCULATED RISKS AND GO BACK TO
[ct=3398.251] THE SUPER BOWL.
[ct=3400.636] EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THE PHILLY
[ct=3400.976] SPECIAL HERE.
[ct=3403.820] IT IS AN AGGRESSIVE MINDSET, AND
[ct=3405.813] IT PAYS OFF AND GIVES TREVOR
[ct=3408.200] LAWRENCE A NEW SET OF DOWNS AND
[ct=3410.091] A COUPLE OF SHOTS IN THE END
[ct=3411.450] YOU NEVER KNOW.
[ct=3415.195] AL: LOGAN COOKE HAD KIRK: A NICE
[ct=3415.528] PASS.
[ct=3420.896] KIRK:SHIRTED -- SURE DID.
[ct=3424.641] AL: HE IS THE PUNTER, THE
[ct=3430.175] HOLDER, AND IN 10 DAYS IN
[ct=3431.620] ENGLAND, HE PLAYED FOUR ROUNDS
[ct=3431.857] OF GOLF.
[ct=3435.027] SECOND AND 3.
[ct=3438.489] THAT IS CAUGHT, AND LET'S SEE
[ct=3439.043] WHAT A SPOT IT.
[ct=3442.239] FIRST DOWN INITIALLY, AND THEN
[ct=3442.991] BACK.
[ct=3446.302] KIRK: FOR AN AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE,
[ct=3449.396] THEY HAVE BEEN FIXING IN A
[ct=3450.773] LITTLE BIT MORE ZONE ON THE
[ct=3452.739] SERIES RELYING ON THAT FRONT TO
[ct=3454.306] TRY TO GET HOME AND TRY TO KEEP
[ct=3455.401] THE BALL IN FRONT AND RALLY TO
[ct=3460.101] DEFENSIVE LINE, THEY GET INTO
[ct=3462.592] ROTATING DIFFERENT PLAYERS,
[ct=3465.412] JORDAN, BRESEE.
[ct=3469.545] ALL CAN WIN ONE-ON-ONE BATTLES
[ct=3469.839] UP FRONT.
[ct=3471.811] AL: THIRD DOWN, 2.
[ct=3477.084] THROWS.
[ct=3481.223] AND IT IS PICKED!
[ct=3482.969] LATTIMORE!
[ct=3487.954] TAKING THE BIG POSITION.
[ct=3488.550] THAT DRIVE ENDS THERE.
[ct=3491.226] 10 FOR AGNEW.
[ct=3495.079] IN A MOMENT OF TIME WHEN THEY
[ct=3495.423] REALLY NEEDED IT.
[ct=3499.165] KIRK: AGNEW IS KNOWN FOR SWEEPS,
[ct=3501.090] REVERSES AND SPEED, NOT
[ct=3501.594] NECESSARILY HIS ROUTE RUNNING.
[ct=3506.458] LATTIMORE, A CRAFTY VETERAN, HAS
[ct=3508.410] HIS EYES ON THE QUARTERBACK BUT
[ct=3509.382] HE DOES NOT GET FULL TO THE
[ct=3511.165] INSIDE AND IS ABLE TO REVERSE
[ct=3512.955] AND THEN CLOSE ON IT,
[ct=3514.225] ANTICIPATING THAT ALL IS GOING
[ct=3516.115] TO BE THROWN LOW AND THE WEIGHT
[ct=3518.168] AND IS ABLE TO LAY OUT AND MAKE
[ct=3519.244] A BALL.
[ct=3520.542] IT LOOKS LIKE HE GOT HIS ARMS
[ct=3522.236] UNDER THAT FOOTBALL BEFORE IT
[ct=3522.562] HIT THE GROUND.
[ct=3529.156] AL: BIG PLAY, LOOKING AT 17-SIX,
[ct=3529.434] 21-6.
[ct=3531.825] REFEREE: THE PREVIOUS PLAY IS
[ct=3532.119] UNDER REVIEW.
[ct=3535.196] KIRK: THEY WILL TAKE A PEEK TO
[ct=3537.868] SEE IF HE GOT HIS FOREARMS
[ct=3538.407] UNDERNEATH THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=3544.347] AL: WHAT IS YOUR INITIAL
[ct=3544.594] ASSESSMENT?
[ct=3547.776] >> HE DOES GET CONTROLLED WITHIN
[ct=3549.181] THE BALL HITS THE GROUND AND THE
[ct=3550.671] BALL MOVES IN HIS HANDS.
[ct=3552.191] THIS SHOULD BE IN INCOMPLETE
[ct=3557.483] AL: SO UNDERNEATH FALLS ON THE
[ct=3558.617] GROUND THERE.
[ct=3558.889] OK.
[ct=3565.474] INTERESTING.
[ct=3570.155] KIRK: TERRY AND THE BOYS AT THE
[ct=3570.155] BIG BOX.
[ct=3574.213] I DO NOT SEE THE MOVEMENT THE
[ct=3574.765] WAY TERRY DOES.
[ct=3577.483] AND MAYBE I AM IN ALL OF THE
[ct=3579.889] COVERAGE OF HOW GOOD A PLAY HE
[ct=3580.225] MADE ON THAT FOOTBALL.
[ct=3583.664] THE RULING ON THE FIELD WAS IN
[ct=3584.179] INTERCEPTION.
[ct=3585.963] THEY WOULD HAVE TO REVERSE THAT.
[ct=3592.684] AND DOES THE GROUND HELP THEM
[ct=3593.235] CONTROL IT IS THE QUESTION.
[ct=3604.007] >> THE PREVIOUS SHOT WE SHOWED
[ct=3604.291] WAS THE BEST.
[ct=3606.890] YOU SAW PRETTY SIGNIFICANT
[ct=3607.791] MOVEMENT WHEN THE BALL HIT THE
[ct=3610.955] REFEREE: AFTER REVIEWING THE
[ct=3613.193] PLAY, THE BALL HIT GROUND.
[ct=3615.761] THEREFORE, INCOMPLETE PASS,
[ct=3618.763] AL: THE MINUTE WE START TALKING
[ct=3623.781] ABOUT IT AT 14-6, NOW WE ARE
[ct=3628.685] 17-6 WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF
[ct=3629.192] ANOTHER.
[ct=3630.586] MEANWHILE, WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS
[ct=3630.860] A FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=3633.154] THAT WAS A THIRD AND 2.
[ct=3637.754] NOW THE FIELD GOAL COMES OUT AND
[ct=3638.675] YOU HAVE A 43 YARD ATTEMPT
[ct=3643.155] COMING UP FOR BRANDON MCMANUS,
[ct=3644.529] SEVERAL GOOD YEARS FOR HIM IN
[ct=3648.018] DENVER, 10TH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=3653.129] REFEREE: 36 SECONDS, 3-6.
[ct=3655.748] AL: HAS A SUPER BOWL RING WITH
[ct=3657.101] THE BRONCOS WHEN HE KNOCKED OFF
[ct=3660.855] THE PANTHERS BACK IN SUPER BOWL
[ct=3664.528] A 43 YARD ATTEMPT HERE.
[ct=3668.578] SEEMS TO GET THE BALL WHEN WE
[ct=3670.024] START THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=3679.304] AND THAT ONE IS TRUE AND
[ct=3683.112] MAKES IT AN 11 POINT GAME.
[ct=3687.592] KIRK: THEY'RE ABLE TO GET THOSE
[ct=3688.193] THREE POINTS.
[ct=3689.540] LET'S LOOK AT OUR NEXT GEN
[ct=3691.350] STATS., POWERED BY AWS
[ct=3694.544] THE BIG EMPHASIS WITH THAT KNEE
[ct=3695.083] WAS TO GET THE BALL OUT QUICKLY
[ct=3696.979] FOR TREVOR LAWRENCE.
[ct=3699.851] SOMETHING HE EXCELS AT ANYWAY.
[ct=3701.168] SECOND-FASTEST IN THE LEAGUE ON
[ct=3702.681] HIS AVERAGE AT 2.39.
[ct=3705.267] YOU CAN SEE 2.36 SECONDS TO
[ct=3710.431] THROW, SO HE IS BACK THERE,
[ct=3710.959] GETTING THE BALL OUT.
[ct=3713.636] SECOND-FASTEST AVERAGE HE HAS
[ct=3715.585] HAD HIS ENTIRE CAREER.
[ct=3717.820] SO HE IS SEEING IT, AND THEY PUT
[ct=3718.776] TOGETHER A GREAT PLAN FOR HIM TO
[ct=3720.981] BE ABLE TO GET THE BALL OUT AND
[ct=3721.253] FIND MATCHUPS.
[ct=3725.191] AL: NO ONE IS MORE FRUSTRATED
[ct=3726.036] WITH HIMSELF AND CAM JORDAN.
[ct=3729.307] MOST SACKS BY AN ACTIVE PLAYER.
[ct=3730.652] HE SAID, I WILL NEVER CATCH
[ct=3732.213] THEM, THESE QUARTERBACKS ARE
[ct=3734.112] GETTING RID OF THE BALL INTO .5
[ct=3737.319] SECONDS, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO
[ct=3737.563] DO?
[ct=3739.878] KIRK: ALL HE CAN DO IS TRY TO
[ct=3741.067] KNOCK IT DOWN.
[ct=3741.328] IT IS SO CLOSE.
[ct=3746.750] AL: SO THE SAINTS, WHO HAVE TWO
[ct=3749.996] TIMEOUTS, WILL GET THE BALL AT
[ct=3753.529] THE 25 DOWN BY 11 AND 32.
[ct=3758.726] KIRK: THE JAGS ARE ON THE ROAD,
[ct=3761.504] MINUS TWO WITH A TURNOVER, AND
[ct=3763.085] THEY HAVE SHORT FIELDS, AND HERE
[ct=3765.445] THEY ARE RIGHT NOW UP 11 AS THE
[ct=3767.404] SAINTS OF OFFENSE OF STRUGGLES
[ct=3770.224] CONTINUE -- THE SAINTS'
[ct=3771.553] OFFENSIVE STRUGGLE CONTINUES.
[ct=3776.175] AL: 11 TO 21 FOR JUST 100 YARDS.
[ct=3777.678] LOOK OUT.
[ct=3780.499] LOSES THE BALL, BUT IT IS PICKED
[ct=3783.916] THEY MAINTAIN POSSESSION.
[ct=3785.048] ALMOST A TOTAL DISASTER.
[ct=3787.532] CAMERON IRVING COMES UP WITH A
[ct=3789.733] LOOSE BALL TO RETAIN POSSESSION
[ct=3790.207] AND THE CLOCK KEEPS ROLLING.
[ct=3793.872] REFEREE: FOURTH DOWN PLAY,
[ct=3796.604] FUMBLE, RECOVERED THE BALL.
[ct=3798.325] THE BALL WILL BE RETURNED TO THE
[ct=3799.129] SPOT AS A FUMBLE.
[ct=3802.918] KIRK: YOU TALKED ABOUT TRYING TO
[ct=3804.585] GET TO THE PASS RUSH YEAR, JOSH
[ct=3806.687] ALLEN GETS THERE, ENDS UP
[ct=3809.180] FINISHING IT, SO YOU GET A
[ct=3809.862] QUARTERBACK TO HOLD ONTO THE
[ct=3811.278] THAT IS WHAT CAN HAPPEN.
[ct=3814.787] AL: THEY WIND THE CLOCK AGAIN IN
[ct=3816.359] THE SAINTS SAY, ENOUGH.
[ct=3816.945] THEY WILL REGROUP.
[ct=3820.891] THEY WILL TRY TO DROP IT OVER AT
[ct=3822.605] THE HALF, I FIND OUT WHAT IS
[ct=3823.184] GOING ON.
[ct=3824.641] 17-6 COMING BACK FROM THE BREAK.
[ct=3827.344] STATE FARM HALFTIME SHOW.
[ct=3829.559] STICK THE SAINTS WILL GET THE BA
[ct=3831.605] SEE IF THEY CAN MUSTER SOMETHING
[ct=3832.777] OFF IN SIBLEY WE START THE
[ct=3833.379] SECOND HALF.
[ct=3836.273] JAGS LOOKING FOR THEIR FOURTH
[ct=3838.405] STRAIGHT WIN.
[ct=3843.025] SAINTS TRYING TO GET ABOVE --
[ct=3843.857] 500.
[ct=3845.210] TO THE FIELD TO GO, KAYLEE.
[ct=3847.599] KAYLEE: WHAT HAVE YOU IDENTIFIED
[ct=3849.532] AS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM
[ct=3850.053] CHALLENGING YOUR OFFENSE?
[ct=3852.423] >> WE HAVE TO WIN SITUATIONAL
[ct=3854.202] FOOTBALL, TO BE ABLE TO SCORE
[ct=3856.489] POINTS, CONVERT ON THIRD DOWN,
[ct=3859.045] KICK A FIELD GOAL.
[ct=3860.436] IT IS LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT
[ct=3862.307] THAT WE HAVE TO DO TO GIVE
[ct=3862.977] OURSELVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO WIN
[ct=3862.977] A GAME.
[ct=3865.761] KAYLEE: WHAT ADJUSTMENTS WILL WE
[ct=3866.028] SEE IN THE GAME?
[ct=3868.400] >> IT IS ALL ABOUT EXECUTION.
[ct=3872.461] IT IS LIGHT,R.C. SAID TO THE
[ct=3875.064] OFFENSE, LET'S MAKE PLAYS THAT
[ct=3876.000] WE ARE CAPABLE OF MAKING.
[ct=3876.341] THAT IS WHAT IT IS ABOUT.
[ct=3879.042] AL: KAYLEE WITH DENNIS ALLEN.
[ct=3883.390] COMING BACK TO MAKE THAT CATCH,
[ct=3883.640] TURNING TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=3886.983] CARR PUT IT RIGHT ON THE MONEY,
[ct=3887.968] GAIN OF 15.
[ct=3890.788] KIRK: THERE'S EXECUTION YOU LIKE
[ct=3892.955] TO SEE FROM DEREK CARR, ONE OF
[ct=3894.706] HIS TOP RECEIVERS, OLAVE.
[ct=3897.906] HE GOT IT OUT WITHOUT A HITCH
[ct=3898.259] AND DELIVERED THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=3899.582] IN RHYTHM.
[ct=3906.643] AL: NOTHING.
[ct=3910.030] RIGHT THERE, KAMARA TONIGHT ON
[ct=3910.702] THE GROUND.
[ct=3912.950] ACTUALLY DOING A GREAT JOB
[ct=3917.711] DEFENDING NINE TOTAL YARDS.
[ct=3917.975] IT CARRIES.
[ct=3923.573] AND IT IS OFFENSE OF LINE.
[ct=3926.953] IT HAS NOT SPENT A LOT OF TIME
[ct=3927.501] PLAYING TOGETHER.
[ct=3929.803] I AM SURE THE COMMUNICATION OF
[ct=3931.521] MOVEMENT UP FRONT HAS BEEN
[ct=3931.776] AFFECTED.
[ct=3934.726] THEY ARE FREEING UP THOSE
[ct=3935.245] LINEBACKERS TO COMPLETELY TAKE
[ct=3936.187] AWAY THE THREAT FOR THE RUN
[ct=3937.271] GAME.
[ct=3946.438] AL: SECOND AND 9.
[ct=3949.923] HE CHASES, GETS IT AWAY.
[ct=3951.350] CATCHES MADE AT THE 45.
[ct=3953.113] MOREAU,
[ct=3955.037] HERNDON.
[ct=3957.980] SO THIRD DOWN AND 4 FOR THE
[ct=3958.213] SAINTS.
[ct=3961.142] KIRK: WHEN THEY HAVE HAD
[ct=3961.627] PRESSURE THEY HAVE DISGUISED IT
[ct=3964.598] THIS TIME HE DOES NOT COME UP
[ct=3967.787] WITH A SACK, BUT JUST BY
[ct=3969.161] DISGUISING IT, PUTTING PRESSURE
[ct=3970.152] ON THE QUARTERBACK, ABLE TO
[ct=3970.991] CHECK IT DOWN.
[ct=3973.952] A GOOD JOB BEING ABLE TO
[ct=3974.376] IMPROVISE.
[ct=3983.945] AL: A LITTLE SHORT OF THE FIRST
[ct=3989.688] NOW AT THE 48 YARD LINE,
[ct=3991.815] DECISION TIME, FOURTH AND 1, 2
[ct=3993.346] MINUTES IN TO THE THIRD QUARTER.
[ct=3998.474] KIRK: ONE OF NINE NOW ON THIRD
[ct=3999.399] DOWNS, THIS IS ABOUT HALF A
[ct=3999.399] YARD.
[ct=4004.731] WE ALWAYS SEE THAT SNEAK.
[ct=4008.504] DEREK CARR, SEE IF HE'S GOING TO
[ct=4009.581] BE INVOLVED IN THAT ONE.
[ct=4015.121] AL: ONE FOR TWO ON FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=4016.495] GOING FOR IT.
[ct=4017.876] THEY GET IT.
[ct=4026.068] AT THE 34 YARD LINE.
[ct=4028.754] THEY NEEDED ONE AND THEY GET 17.
[ct=4031.767] KIRK: GARCIA PULLS AROUND, DOES
[ct=4032.038] A NICE JOB.
[ct=4036.197] WATCH 73 GET A BLOCK RIGHT HERE,
[ct=4037.001] OPENS IT UP LEFT SIDE COLLAPSES
[ct=4038.473] THERE YOU GO.
[ct=4040.471] SHORT YARDAGE DEFENSE.
[ct=4043.273] THAT FIRST INITIAL SURGE.
[ct=4046.325] KHMER HAS A LOT OF ROOM.
[ct=4052.853] -- KAMARA HAS A LOT OF ROOM.
[ct=4063.758] AL: WIDE OPEN BUT HE GETS ABOUT
[ct=4064.574] SIX BEFORE THE TACKLE IS MADE,
[ct=4064.992] SECOND DOWN.
[ct=4068.531] KIRK: GO BACK TO THE DEFENSIVE
[ct=4069.834] PLAN BY MIKE CALDWELL, GOING UP
[ct=4072.009] AGAINST AN OFFENSE STRUGGLING
[ct=4074.139] WITH CONSISTENCY, YOU WANT TO
[ct=4075.666] MAKE THEM DRIVE THE LENGTH OF
[ct=4076.002] THE FIELD TO EARN IT.
[ct=4076.983] THAT'S WHAT HEâ€™S DOING.
[ct=4079.391] FORCING THE BALL TO BE THROWN
[ct=4079.708] UNDERNEATH.
[ct=4090.381] AL: THAT MEANS OF COURSE --
[ct=4090.962] FLANKED BY JAMAAL WILLIAMS.
[ct=4092.794] KEEPS IT.
[ct=4104.239] HILL COMES IN.
[ct=4107.038] BACK COMES CARR.
[ct=4110.465] KIRK: YOU KNOW CHANCES ARE HE'S
[ct=4111.992] GOING TO HOLD ONTO THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=4112.977] THEY ARE IN POSITION AND THEN
[ct=4113.266] BANG.
[ct=4117.109] YOU TALK ABOUT A WAY TO TRY TO
[ct=4118.852] IGNITE AN OFFENSE, RUNS LIKE
[ct=4119.981] THIS WHETHER IT IS THE RUNNING
[ct=4121.033] BACK OR ESPECIALLY THE
[ct=4122.016] QUARTERBACK RUNNING OVER TOP OF
[ct=4123.467] DEFENDERS, PICKING UP FIRS
[ct=4123.804] DOWNS.
[ct=4125.983] AL: PRETTY VALUABLE ASSET.
[ct=4130.266] CISCO AT THE END OF THE PLAY.
[ct=4130.607] 23 YARD LINE.
[ct=4136.300] NOTHING THERE.
[ct=4138.735] THROWS IT INTO THE GROUND.
[ct=4140.419] IT IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=4145.561] CISCO FORCING THE THROW, SECOND
[ct=4145.910] AND 10.
[ct=4149.597] KIRK: THIS IS JUST GOOD
[ct=4149.936] AWARENESS.
[ct=4152.463] HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE SEEN THIS
[ct=4152.729] ANSWER?
[ct=4154.426] THEY ARE TRYING TO SET UP A
[ct=4154.694] SCREEN.
[ct=4157.137] I THINK THEY TIP THEIR HAND TO
[ct=4158.568] DEFENSE GETS OUT.
[ct=4160.346] ALMOST WAITING FOR IT.
[ct=4165.721] YOUTH SEE HIM, THROW IT, I WILL
[ct=4166.020] CATCH IT.
[ct=4172.191] AL: CARR IN THE MIDDLE.
[ct=4174.873] POTENTIAL FLAG AT THE 32 YARD
[ct=4178.675] MOREAU.
[ct=4182.202] COVERED BY LLOYD.
[ct=4185.214] HERE IS LAND CLARK.
[ct=4190.598] >> HOLDING.
[ct=4191.070] OFFENSE NUMBER 75.
[ct=4193.986] 10 YARD PENALTY, SECOND DOWN.
[ct=4200.707] AL: NUMBER ONE PICK IN 2015, IN
[ct=4201.066] HIS NINTH SEASON.
[ct=4203.782] KIRK: THEY ARE TRYING TO FIGURE
[ct=4204.363] OUT THE LEFT TACKLE SPOT.
[ct=4206.940] THE FIRST ROUNDER FROM A COUPLE
[ct=4207.861] YEARS AGO HAS BEEN THE GUY.
[ct=4211.223] NOW THEY HAVE TRIED TO FIND NEW
[ct=4211.223] ANSWERS.
[ct=4212.449] TODAY IT IS PETE, TRYING TO HOLD
[ct=4214.626] UP ON AN ISLAND.
[ct=4216.528] PULLS THEM DOWN BY THE FRONT OF
[ct=4217.114] THE JERSEY.
[ct=4220.549] REMEMBER WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT
[ct=4222.983] THEY SELF-DESTRUCTED WITH
[ct=4224.263] PENALTIES, THINGS TO GET BEHIND
[ct=4232.580] THE --
[ct=4236.638] AL: ONE MORE SECOND ON THE CLOCK
[ct=4237.242] FOR WHAT THAT'S WORTH.
[ct=4240.203] NINTH PLAY OF THE DRIVE.
[ct=4244.248] SECOND AND 20.
[ct=4256.311] TO THE OUTSIDE, NOBODYâ€™
[ct=4258.350] TO THE OUTSIDE, NOBODY'S HOME.
[ct=4258.350] NOBODY.
[ct=4263.416] >> THE FACT HE WAS NOT UNDER
[ct=4267.833] PRESSURE IS TELLING ME THERE
[ct=4268.197] WILL NOT BE A POTENTIAL
[ct=4268.943] GROUNDING.
[ct=4273.686] THIS DRIVE IS REALLY A MICROCOSM
[ct=4274.063] OF THE SEASON.
[ct=4277.178] MOVING THE BALL, MOVING THE
[ct=4277.732] BALL, HOLDING CALL.
[ct=4281.139] SECOND AT 20.
[ct=4281.712] FOLLOW IT UP WITH A PASS TO
[ct=4288.494] AL: RUNNING INTO A STONE WALL.
[ct=4293.975] CAUGHT INSIDE THE 30 SO AT LEAST
[ct=4294.550] HE WILL SET UP A FIELD GOAL.
[ct=4299.661] MOREAU MAKING THE CATCH, JENKINS
[ct=4299.957] IS THERE WITH HERNDON.
[ct=4303.478] IT WILL BE FOURTH AND 10.
[ct=4306.908] THEY WILL TRY TO MAKE IT A ONE
[ct=4307.147] POSSESSION GAME AGAIN.
[ct=4313.066] A MICROCOSM, MOVE IT, STOP.
[ct=4316.438] KIRK: THERE IS THE FRUSTRATION
[ct=4316.716] AGAIN FROM DEREK CARR.
[ct=4318.195] MAKES ME WONDER.
[ct=4320.072] APPEARED TO THROW IT TO NOBODY.
[ct=4325.590] DID NOT CHECK WITH THAT BLITZ.
[ct=4327.459] THEY GOT IT TOO FAR.
[ct=4333.715] AL: GUYS WANT TO PLAY THAT.
[ct=4336.200] KIRK: MICAH PARSONS SAID I'M IN.
[ct=4338.241] I WILL TAKE TYREEK HILL.
[ct=4341.257] AL: IMAGINE TYREEK HILL IN FLAG
[ct=4341.526] FOOTBALL.
[ct=4345.133] KIRK: GOT TO BE AN INTERNATIONAL
[ct=4345.488] RULED.
[ct=4349.169] THIS IS WHAT I THINK CREATED THE
[ct=4349.496] FRUSTRATION.
[ct=4350.907] YOU GET A BLITZ.
[ct=4355.666] HE WANTS TO THROW OUT HERE TO
[ct=4359.121] KAMARA CONTINUES DOWNFIELD.
[ct=4360.817] DID NOT SEE THE BLITZ.
[ct=4363.841] HE REALIZED WHAT JUST HAPPENED
[ct=4364.454] AND SAID THAT ONE IS ON ME.
[ct=4367.171] HE WENT TO THE SIDELINE AND
[ct=4367.786] TALKED TO DEREK CARR.
[ct=4370.919] THAT WAS ON SECOND AND 20 BEFORE
[ct=4371.560] THE COMPLETION ON THIRD DOWN.
[ct=4374.142] HE WENT OVER TO TALK TO HIM.
[ct=4377.590] ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THESE GUYS
[ct=4378.236] TRYING TO WORK OUT THE KINKS OF
[ct=4378.864] THIS OFFENSE.
[ct=4384.513] AL: THE PLAY BLOWN DEAD.
[ct=4387.634] KIRK: WE HAVE SEEN DEREK CARR
[ct=4389.343] MORE ANIMATED AND FRUSTRATED THE
[ct=4391.938] LAST TWO WEEKS THEN WE HAVE SEEN
[ct=4393.897] IN A LONG TIME WHEN HE WAS WITH
[ct=4394.160] THE RAIDERS.
[ct=4395.808] AL: VERY MUCH SO.
[ct=4398.781] >> FALSE START, OFFENSE.
[ct=4400.377] NO FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4403.161] AL: HE GOT FRUSTRATED TOWARD THE
[ct=4404.453] END OF LAST YEAR IN LAS VEGAS.
[ct=4412.803] HE WINDS UP GOING BACK WITH
[ct=4413.139] DENNIS ALLEN.
[ct=4416.392] HE STARTED AS A ROOKIE IN 2014.
[ct=4418.643] KIRK: THAT'S RIGHT.
[ct=4427.089] AL: SO IT IS FIRST AND 15 NOW.
[ct=4429.433] QUICK THROW TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=4432.443] ABOUT A FOUR YARD PICKUP.
[ct=4436.641] CALVIN RIDLEY WAS WITH ATLANTA.
[ct=4438.481] HE WAS OUT ALL OF LAST YEAR.
[ct=4441.566] HE WAS IN A GAMBLING SITUATION.
[ct=4444.333] HE TALKED ABOUT IT VERY OPENLY.
[ct=4448.388] TALKED TO THE ATHENS JOURNAL
[ct=4449.993] ABOUT IT, DEPRESSION.
[ct=4454.281] A TERRIBLE MISTAKE, GOT TRADED
[ct=4454.763] TO JACKSONVILLE, HERE HE IS.
[ct=4460.376] KIRK: HE IS FINDING HIS ROLE
[ct=4460.884] WITH AN OFFENSE THAT HAS A LOT
[ct=4461.295] OF FIREPOWER.
[ct=4463.416] WHEN JONES COMES BACK, INGRAM,
[ct=4466.334] RIDLEY, KIRK, NTN, THEY ARE
[ct=4470.779] LOADED -- ETIENNE, THEY ARE
[ct=4470.779] LOADED.
[ct=4475.432] AL: AT THE 20 YARD LINE, TIM
[ct=4477.057] NES, RECIPIENT ON THE FAKE
[ct=4477.549] PUNT EARLIER.
[ct=4479.417] THIRD DOWN.
[ct=4482.715] KIRK: AS BAD AS THIS HAS BEEN
[ct=4484.484] FOR THE SAINTS OFFENSE, THE JAGS
[ct=4486.031] HAVE TO BE CAREFUL LETTING HIM
[ct=4486.285] HANG AROUND.
[ct=4489.581] ONE THING DOUG PEDERSON TOLD US
[ct=4490.241] IS HE IS TRYING TO TEACH HIS
[ct=4492.541] TEAM HOW TO BE A WINNER, HOW TO
[ct=4493.427] HANDLE SUCCESS.
[ct=4495.612] WHEN YOU HAVE A TEAM THAT IS NOT
[ct=4496.683] PLAYING WELL YOU NEED TO BURY
[ct=4500.230] THEM, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO
[ct=4500.518] DO THAT.
[ct=4505.270] AL: THIRD AND SIX.
[ct=4509.291] ETIENNE INSIDE, HANDOFF CLOSE.
[ct=4510.996] A LITTLE BIT SHORT.
[ct=4515.956] I THINK WARNER MAKES THE TACKLE,
[ct=4516.291] FOURTH AND INCHES.
[ct=4522.562] DOES PETERSON WANT TO GAMBLE?
[ct=4528.569] IT IS ONE OF THOSE LOOKS.
[ct=4532.449] KIRK: IF HE HAD A HEALTHY 16 HE
[ct=4534.703] PROBABLY SNEAKS IT AND GET IT.
[ct=4537.975] THEN AGAIN, WITH A FAKE PUNT
[ct=4538.227] LAST TIME.
[ct=4539.870] HEADS ARE ON A SWIVEL.
[ct=4543.050] AL: LATTIMORE IS LINED UP NOW ON
[ct=4543.439] THE LEFT SIDE.
[ct=4548.466] NOT A MOMENT FOR THE PUSH
[ct=4549.037] EITHER.
[ct=4550.802] HERE IS LOGAN COOKE.
[ct=4553.495] NO FAKE THIS TIME.
[ct=4555.245] BOOMING KICK.
[ct=4557.112] BEAUTIFUL.
[ct=4560.370] OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 15 YARD
[ct=4567.553] THAT IS A 53 YARD MATCHUP AS WE
[ct=4567.850] BEEN TALKING ABOUT.
[ct=4574.429] THIS JAGUAR'S DEFENSE, THEY HAVE
[ct=4577.971] SAT BACK, TAKING NOTES, BUT THEY
[ct=4578.507] ARE PLAYING FOOTBALL WELL.
[ct=4581.864] YOU HAVE TO APPRECIATE HOW THEY
[ct=4582.818] ARE GETTING THEIR HEADS TURNED
[ct=4583.373] AROUND AND LOCATING THE
[ct=4585.903] GETTING IN POSITION TO KNOCK THE
[ct=4586.185] BALL AWAY.
[ct=4587.865] MAKING IT THAT MUCH TOUGHER ON
[ct=4590.594] CARR AND THIS OFFENSE TO FIND
[ct=4590.899] THEIR RHYTHM.
[ct=4593.411] AL: START FROM THE 13 HERE.
[ct=4596.326] RUNNING BACK IS WILLIAMS.
[ct=4597.878] HE GETS IT.
[ct=4600.459] GETS NOTHING.
[ct=4603.053] IT IS STUFF TO THEIR.
[ct=4609.756] RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE, NUMBER 94
[ct=4610.456] GETS THE STOP.
[ct=4612.886] KIRK: THIS IS WHY IT IS TOUGH TO
[ct=4612.886] RUN.
[ct=4615.799] YOU WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO RUN
[ct=4617.039] THE FOOTBALL TO TAKE PRESSURE
[ct=4617.325] OFF THIS OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=4619.138] BUT LOOK WHAT YOU ARE DEALING
[ct=4621.423] THE OUTSIDE LINEBACKERS WALKED
[ct=4625.126] WHEN EVERYONE IS COVERED, YOU
[ct=4625.779] HAVE THOSE LINEBACKERS FLYING
[ct=4627.069] DOWNHILL AND THEY ARE JUST
[ct=4627.651] RUNNING INTO A WALL.
[ct=4636.416] AL: THROW, NO GOOD.
[ct=4640.571] INTENDED FOR MICHAEL THOMAS WHO
[ct=4641.116] AT LEAST IS HEALTHY THIS YEAR.
[ct=4644.557] HE HAS PLAYED 10 GAMES IN THREE
[ct=4645.202] PRIOR SEASONS.
[ct=4648.449] KIRK: WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY THE
[ct=4650.022] RUNNING GAME IT IS NOT A THREAT.
[ct=4653.422] YOU MAKE HIM ONE-DIMENSIONAL,
[ct=4654.004] PUTS EVERYTHING ON THE SHOULDERS
[ct=4654.316] OF CARR.
[ct=4657.447] AND AN OFFENSIVE LINE THAT IS
[ct=4658.236] DOING THEIR BEST TO HANDLE THE
[ct=4658.666] PRESSURE.
[ct=4669.839] AL: CARR THIRD AND 10.
[ct=4671.852] STEPS UP, FIRES.
[ct=4677.342] THE INTERCEPTION OFF THE
[ct=4677.609] DEFLECTION.
[ct=4685.813] OLUOKUN CLOSE TO THE GOAL LINE.
[ct=4686.759] THEY ARE CELEBRATING AS IF HE'S
[ct=4689.622] IN THERE AND THEY SAY HE IS.
[ct=4689.925] THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=4695.042] ANOTHER BATTED BALL.
[ct=4698.273] KIRK: THEY HAVE BEEN FORCING
[ct=4699.996] CARR TO BE PATIENT.
[ct=4703.025] CHECK IT DOWN, CHECK IT DOWN.
[ct=4704.393] HE HAS.
[ct=4707.824] THIS TIME ON THIRD AND 10
[ct=4708.512] INSTEAD OF CHECKING IT DOWN HE
[ct=4708.512] FORCES ONE.
[ct=4711.977] THEN THEY FORCED HIM TO BE
[ct=4712.521] IMPATIENT ON THIS THIRD DOWN.
[ct=4715.704] WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN THE FIRST
[ct=4719.648] BUT WOULD HAVE AVOIDED THE
[ct=4723.794] TIGHT COVERAGE, ANOTHER
[ct=4725.047] CONTESTED COVERAGE.
[ct=4728.414] OLUOKUN IS ABLE TO GET TO THE
[ct=4729.042] CORNER AND GET THE TOUCHDOWN FOR
[ct=4729.333] THE JAGS.
[ct=4732.340] GREAT DEFENSE ALL AROUND FROM
[ct=4732.604] JACKSONVILLE.
[ct=4735.938] AL: THE MAN WHO HAS LED THE
[ct=4737.145] LEAGUE IN TACKLES EACH OF THE
[ct=4738.300] LAST TWO SEASONS CAME OVER LAST
[ct=4738.968] YEAR FROM ATLANTA.
[ct=4740.822] GETS THE FIRST TOUCHDOWN OF HIS
[ct=4741.180] CAREER.
[ct=4744.762] AND THE EXTRA POINT IS GOOD OFF
[ct=4749.032] THE FOOT OF MCMANUS.
[ct=4751.794] 6:47 TO GO IN AN EXASPERATED
[ct=4752.733] SUPERDOME.
[ct=4761.314] BALL -- DUVALL.
[ct=4765.373] NOT NAMED AFTER ROBERT BUT AFTER
[ct=4765.963] THE COUNTY JACKSONVILLE IS IN.
[ct=4770.339] KAYLEE: PLAYS LIKE THAT PICK SIX
[ct=4774.278] ARE WHY THE JAGUARS OLUOKUN IS
[ct=4774.616] THE LEADER OF THE DEFENSE.
[ct=4778.935] JOSH ALLEN TOLD ME THE FIRE HE
[ct=4779.466] PLAYS WITH HIS UNBELIEVABLE AND
[ct=4782.883] WHEN HE SPEAKS, ALLEN SAID, I
[ct=4784.512] GIVE HIM NOTHING BUT EYE CONTACT
[ct=4786.055] BECAUSE THAT IS THE RESPECT HE
[ct=4786.622] HAS EARNED FROM MY EYES.
[ct=4789.393] AL: WE HAD A MEETING LAST YEAR.
[ct=4792.280] ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING
[ct=4792.806] MEETINGS WE HAVE HAD WITH A GUY.
[ct=4796.415] WENT TO YALE, PARENTS ARE FROM
[ct=4798.583] NIGERIA, TERRIFIC GUY.
[ct=4800.104] FASCINATING GUY.
[ct=4803.605] THIS IS THOMAS TRYING TO GET
[ct=4803.884] FREE.
[ct=4805.374] EXTRA COUPLE OF YARDS.
[ct=4809.503] FIRST CATCH OF THE NIGHT FOR A
[ct=4810.184] GUY WHO IS THE OFFENSIVE PLAYER
[ct=4811.612] OF THE YEAR IN 2019.
[ct=4814.109] KIRK: THE OTHER THING THAT
[ct=4819.554] STANDS OUT, THEY SAID WHEN YOUR
[ct=4821.012] BEST PLAYER IS YOUR HARDEST
[ct=4821.823] WORKER, IT SETS THE TONE FOR THE
[ct=4823.935] AL: SECOND AND TWO.
[ct=4827.738] TACKLE AT THE 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=4830.441] KIRK: THERE IS THE SCREEN.
[ct=4832.913] WE HAVE SEEN IT CALLED A FEW
[ct=4833.407] MORE TIMES.
[ct=4835.918] HAVE BEEN TRYING TO HIT THAT
[ct=4836.483] OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS.
[ct=4838.326] TIMING HAS BEEN OFF.
[ct=4842.448] TONIGHT KAMARA HAS HAD A COUPLE
[ct=4843.250] OPPORTUNITIES TO GET OUT AND
[ct=4843.584] MAKE SOME PLAYS.
[ct=4849.259] AL: 22 DRIVES WITHOUT A TD IN
[ct=4849.610] THIS BUILDING.
[ct=4861.816] SHAHEED, NEED TO USE HIM MORE
[ct=4862.097] GIVEN HE IS THIRD TEAM.
[ct=4866.523] KIRK: IN HIS SECOND YEAR, TO GET
[ct=4867.019] MORE AND MORE COMFORTABLE WITH
[ct=4869.011] HIS ROLE IN THIS OFFENSE AT THE
[ct=4869.274] SLOT.
[ct=4887.935] AL: CHANGING THE MIDDLE
[ct=4891.443] HILL.
[ct=4896.666] DARIOUS WILLIAMS TACKLES HIM.
[ct=4898.661] A PRICE ON THAT ONE.
[ct=4900.104] GAIN OF SEVEN.
[ct=4903.519] KIRK: WHEN YOU HEAR HE IS ABOUT
[ct=4904.946] TO SNAP THE BALL, THEY MOVED AND
[ct=4905.513] HE SWITCHES TO 33.
[ct=4907.895] IMAGINE WHAT THAT OFFENSIVE LINE
[ct=4908.196] IS DOING.
[ct=4910.415] A LOT OF THESE GUYS HAVE NOT
[ct=4911.073] PLAYED A LOT OF FOOTBALL
[ct=4911.370] TOGETHER.
[ct=4913.477] AL: AND PRAYING.
[ct=4916.414] THE CATCH IS MADE AND THAT IS A
[ct=4919.742] NICE-LOOKING DRIVE.
[ct=4920.774] THEY MOVE THE BALL VERY WELL.
[ct=4924.338] WHEN THEY GET DOWN DEEP, YES.
[ct=4924.616] HUGE PROBLEM.
[ct=4928.342] KIRK: RIGHT NOW HE IS JUST SMART
[ct=4930.405] TO TAKE THESE UNDERNEATH THROWS.
[ct=4931.261] JACKSONVILLE SITTING BACK ALMOST
[ct=4933.065] GIVING HIM THE SHORTER THROWS.
[ct=4939.962] AL: KAMARA.
[ct=4941.959] BREAKS DOWN.
[ct=4943.605] KNIFING THROUGH.
[ct=4945.352] THERE IS THAT MAN AGAIN.
[ct=4945.947] OLUOKUN.
[ct=4948.722] KIRK: HE CLOSES IN A HURRY.
[ct=4952.562] 6â€™
[ct=4953.101] 6'2", 230.
[ct=4956.181] THIS ENTIRE DEFENSE, WE HAD THEM
[ct=4957.502] LATE LAST YEAR.
[ct=4961.449] OLUOKUN CAME OVER LAST YEAR FROM
[ct=4961.449] ATLANTA.
[ct=4963.640] NOW HE'S IN HIS SECOND YEAR.
[ct=4965.257] WATCH HOW QUICKLY.
[ct=4967.010] HEâ€™
[ct=4967.895] HE'S NOT WASTING ANY TIME OR
[ct=4968.828] ENERGY THE WAY HE COMES ABOUT A
[ct=4971.891] PLAY -- COMES UP OUT OF PLAY.
[ct=4974.821] AL: THE BALL AT THE 28 YARD
[ct=4977.477] THE TAG BY TYLER LACY.
[ct=4979.690] HERE COMES THE THIRD DOWN AND
[ct=4982.253] KIRK: A ROUGH NIGHT ON THE THIRD
[ct=4987.094] THIS IS WHERE JACKSONVILLE, THEY
[ct=4988.127] SQUEEZE UP, TAKE AWAY THE EASIER
[ct=4989.893] THROWS INSTEAD OF SITTING BACK.
[ct=4994.153] TRYING TO MAKE DEREK CARR HOLD
[ct=4994.763] ONTO THE FOOTBALL AND GIVE JOSH
[ct=4995.597] ALLEN TIME TO GET HOME.
[ct=4998.099] AL: THAT ONE WAS ON THE FIRST
[ct=4999.677] DONâ€™
[ct=5000.317] DON'T GET ONE HERE EITHER.
[ct=5002.153] COME UP SHORT.
[ct=5004.809] KAMARA SETTING UP A FOURTH AND
[ct=5007.706] 3:30 TO GO IN THE THIRD QUARTER.
[ct=5010.991] KIRK: HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE
[ct=5011.969] SEEN THAT?
[ct=5012.317] EVERYTHING IS TAKEN AWAY
[ct=5014.821] IT IS NOT LIKE DEREK CARR IS
[ct=5017.998] BACK THERE, PITCH, PITCH, PITCH,
[ct=5021.633] HE GETS BACK THERE, ONE HITCH,
[ct=5025.321] IT IS HARD TO WORK THROUGH YOUR
[ct=5025.644] PROGRESSIONS WHEN THAT IS THE
[ct=5026.050] CASE.
[ct=5030.023] AL: DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR.
[ct=5032.423] LONG TIME LINEBACKER IN THE
[ct=5035.664] TOSS ON A FOURTH AND TWO.
[ct=5037.390] GETS THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5041.506] KAMARA OLUOKUN -- KAMARA SWUNG
[ct=5043.595] OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 16.
[ct=5045.339] KIRK: GOOD BLOCK.
[ct=5049.268] BY THE TIGHT END, KAMARA.
[ct=5052.684] -- BY THE TIGHT END MOREAU.
[ct=5055.566] HE DID NOT GRAB ONTO THE JERSEY
[ct=5060.450] SLOW DEVELOPING, HE GETS TO THE
[ct=5061.571] OUTSIDE AND HE'S ABLE TO GET UP
[ct=5071.312] AL: 10TH PLAY OF THE DRIVE.
[ct=5076.990] KAMARA STARTS ONE WAY.
[ct=5077.963] GOES THE OTHER.
[ct=5079.528] BIG MOVE.
[ct=5082.159] INSIDE THE 10.
[ct=5084.546] CAMERON IRVING BLOCK.
[ct=5088.089] SECOND AND FOUR.
[ct=5091.847] KIRK: HE SHOWS GREAT PATIENCE.
[ct=5092.811] PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW DOES HE
[ct=5093.268] STILL HAVE IT?
[ct=5093.902] HE LOOKS LIKE IT.
[ct=5096.076] HE JUST NEEDS HELP AROUND HIM.
[ct=5099.112] THAT TIME HE'S WORKING HIS WAY
[ct=5102.826] NAVIGATING THROUGH THE TEETH OF
[ct=5103.452] THE JACKSONVILLE DEFENSE.
[ct=5108.747] AL: CISCO IS DOWN, THE INJURY
[ct=5115.781] THE DRIVE HAS CONSUMED ALMOST
[ct=5116.107] FIVE MINUTES.
[ct=5119.141] TALKING ABOUTTHIS IS THE SECOND
[ct=5120.365] DRIVE.
[ct=5122.896] THEIR OWN 25 YARD LINE.
[ct=5130.402] NOT THIS TIME.
[ct=5132.110] STOP.
[ct=5135.101] THERE IS OLUOKUN AGAIN ON THAT
[ct=5135.419] TACKLE.
[ct=5136.788] THIRD AND THREE.
[ct=5140.161] KIRK: SO IMPRESSIVE THE WAY HE'S
[ct=5141.008] ABLE TO GET OFF THAT BLOCK AND
[ct=5142.896] MAKE THAT TACKLE AGAINST HILL.
[ct=5146.306] RED ZONE THE LAST TWO GAMES WHEN
[ct=5147.856] THEY HAVE LOST FOOTBALL GAMES,
[ct=5149.090] 0-5 IN THE RED ZONE.
[ct=5151.555] TONIGHT THEY'VE HAD A COUPLE
[ct=5152.179] OPPORTUNITIES, NO TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=5154.755] AL: IT HAS BEEN A PROBLEM
[ct=5155.277] THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.
[ct=5157.812] KIRK: ESPECIALLY NOTICEABLE LAST
[ct=5159.616] WEEK IN THEIR LOSS TO HOUSTON.
[ct=5167.915] AL: HE TAKES IT.
[ct=5171.497] HILL LOOKING FOR THE FIRST DOWN
[ct=5171.813] SHOULD HAVE IT.
[ct=5174.140] WOW.
[ct=5179.881] HILL ON BACK TO BACK PLAYS SETS
[ct=5180.207] UP A FIRST AND GOAL.
[ct=5183.963] KIRK: FINALLY CALLING SAUNDERS
[ct=5184.528] THE BIG DEFENSIVE TACKLE RIGHT
[ct=5187.044] THEY DO ENOUGH OF A JOB.
[ct=5189.220] THEY TRY TO MAKE IT A FOOT RACE.
[ct=5192.252] HE'S ABLE JUST TO GET TO THE
[ct=5198.580] OUT RAN WINGARD TO GET TO THE
[ct=5199.399] CORNER FOR THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5203.716] AL: DEFENSIVE TACKLE LEADING THE
[ct=5203.954] WAY FOR YOU.
[ct=5205.221] FIRST AND GOAL.
[ct=5210.112] BATTED.
[ct=5213.862] ANOTHER BATTED BALL, AND THE
[ct=5213.862] FLAG.
[ct=5217.930] JOSH ALLEN CERTAINLY IN THE
[ct=5218.189] MIDDLE.
[ct=5220.449] FLAG THROWN HIS DIRECTION.
[ct=5222.963] FOSTER MOREAU THE INTENDED
[ct=5233.092] >> PERSONAL FOUL.
[ct=5234.999] UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS.
[ct=5237.582] DEFENSE NUMBER TWO.
[ct=5239.422] AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5243.602] AL: THAT ONE ON RAYSHAWN
[ct=5243.795] JENKINS.
[ct=5245.879] KIRK: I WANT TO SHOW YOU.
[ct=5249.777] I KNOW IT IS A PENALTY BUT THIS
[ct=5250.376] IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE, WATCH THE
[ct=5250.715] ROUTE.
[ct=5252.475] THE BALL SHOULD BE UP RIGHT
[ct=5254.821] HE HAS TO THROUGH THE FOOTBALL
[ct=5255.778] RIGHT THERE AND IT IS A
[ct=5258.335] OBVIOUSLY HE'S CAPABLE OF THAT.
[ct=5259.742] HE'S LATE HERE.
[ct=5264.414] JUST NOT QUITE ON THE SAME PAGE
[ct=5264.660] WITH HIS RECEIVERS.
[ct=5267.076] AL: FIRST AND GOAL.
[ct=5270.141] CAN THEY FINALLY GET IT IN?
[ct=5270.397] NOT YET.
[ct=5273.793] ALVIN KAMARA.
[ct=5282.035] SAUNDERS, WHO PLAYED THE BLOCK
[ct=5283.244] AND ROLL ON THE STOP.
[ct=5284.839] SECOND DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=5287.428] TAKING DOWN TO THE END OF THE
[ct=5290.561] KIRK: WHO GETS OFF THE BALL
[ct=5292.376] QUICKER?
[ct=5293.894] GIVE JACKSONVILLE THE EDGE.
[ct=5295.924] GET INTO THE BACKFIELD, THERE IS
[ct=5297.185] THE LINEBACKERS.
[ct=5302.891] OLUOKUN CLEANING IT UP, HARD TO
[ct=5304.067] GET A PUSH IN THE INTERIOR.
[ct=5311.796] AL: KAMARA GETS JAMMED UP AT THE
[ct=5312.055] HALF-YARD LINE.
[ct=5316.809] THEY GO ANOTHER QUARTER WITHOUT
[ct=5317.182] A TOUCHDOWN AT HOME.
[ct=5320.794] WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
[ct=5322.276] THEY START THE FOURTH, INSIDE
[ct=5324.121] THE START THE FOURTH QUARTER.
[ct=5325.754] THIRD DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=5333.103] CARR UNDER CENTER.
[ct=5336.303] NO.
[ct=5338.646] STILL CANNOT GET IN.
[ct=5341.135] DEVIN LLOYD SHOVES HIM OUT.
[ct=5342.880] HERE WE GO AGAIN.
[ct=5346.974] THIS WILL BE THE 16TH PLAY OF
[ct=5347.342] THE DRIVE.
[ct=5347.597] FOURTH AND GOAL.
[ct=5351.849] KIRK: AS MUCH AS WE TALK ABOUT
[ct=5355.030] -- DEVIN LLOYD IS GROWING UP,
[ct=5356.434] THAT IS HIS 12 TACKLE OF THE
[ct=5357.096] NIGHT AND HE HAS SUCH RANGE.
[ct=5361.309] I FEEL LIKE HE IS STARTING TO
[ct=5361.819] SEE IT AND HAS THE ABILITY TO
[ct=5362.981] GET OUTSIDE IN A HURRY.
[ct=5368.009] KAMARA CANNOT GET THE EDGE
[ct=5368.665] AGAINST DEVIN LLOYD.
[ct=5371.492] KAMARA COMES OUT.
[ct=5372.727] TAYSOM HILL COMES IN.
[ct=5378.195] SAUNDERS AGAIN.
[ct=5380.453] DEFENSIVE TACKLE ON THE
[ct=5380.708] BACKFIELD.
[ct=5382.766] YES.
[ct=5384.542] THEY GET THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=5390.115] SAUNDERS AGAIN LEADING THE WAY.
[ct=5394.543] THE GUY HAS A NEW CAREER.
[ct=5398.308] KIRK: A GOOD GUY TO FOLLOW BUT
[ct=5398.812] GIVE CREDIT TO THE LEFT SIDE.
[ct=5403.599] MOREAU IS ON THE LEFT SIDE.
[ct=5406.038] THEY MOVED IN TREVOR PENNING.
[ct=5409.642] HE JUST COLLAPSED DOWN HERE AND
[ct=5411.253] THE BIG MAN IS ABLE TO LEAD AND
[ct=5411.611] THERE IS NO ONE LEFT.
[ct=5414.691] THAT BECOMES THE ANSWER FOR THE
[ct=5416.249] TAYSOM HILL.
[ct=5418.388] WE HAVE SEEN HIM TONIGHT.
[ct=5420.900] GIVES YOU THE EXTRA BLOCKER
[ct=5422.930] BECAUSE HIS ABILITY TO TAKE THE
[ct=5423.481] DIRECT SNAP AND RUN THE
[ct=5429.037] AL: ONE WORD DESCRIBES THAT.
[ct=5431.022] IT HITS THE UPRIGHT AND GOES
[ct=5433.859] NEVER A DULL MOMENT.
[ct=5435.453] THE ROOKIE KICKER.
[ct=5437.897] PUTTING IT THROUGH.
[ct=5442.923] ONE POSSESSION GAME, 24-16.
[ct=5449.827] ONE OF THOSE GOOD DOINKS.
[ct=5452.351] JOHN MADDEN COINED THAT PHRASE.
[ct=5454.579] IT IS THE PERFECT SOUND.
[ct=5456.223] THAT IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.
[ct=5460.389] KIRK: IF HE WOULD HAVE MISSED
[ct=5462.188] THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A BIG
[ct=5462.454] DEAL.
[ct=5464.169] AL: YES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN.
[ct=5471.161] KIRK: THE SAINTS DEFENSE HAS
[ct=5473.222] KEPT THEM AROUND AND KEPT THEM
[ct=5473.765] WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE.
[ct=5476.103] IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE ENTIRE
[ct=5478.702] GAME, THIS GAME COULD HAVE GONE
[ct=5481.011] SIDEWAYS IN A HURRY WITH THE
[ct=5482.718] TURNOVERS IN THE SHORT FIELD
[ct=5483.405] THAT WE HAVE SEEN.
[ct=5486.099] THE SAINTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
[ct=5486.814] KEEP THEM IN THIS GAME.
[ct=5494.276] EIGHT POINTS, ONE POSSESSION.
[ct=5499.600] AL: 16 PLAYS, 75 YARDS ON THAT
[ct=5499.600] ONE.
[ct=5501.360] THAT IS GRINDING IT OUT.
[ct=5504.450] SEVEN FIRST DOWNS ON THAT DRIVE.
[ct=5511.177] NEAR DOWNTOWN.
[ct=5514.272] TREVOR LAWRENCE.
[ct=5518.725] 155 YARDS.
[ct=5519.544] HAS NOT BEEN SACKED YET.
[ct=5524.012] START ON THE GROUND.
[ct=5530.663] ETIENNE TOOK AN EXTRA MOMENT TO
[ct=5530.999] MAKE SURE HE HAD THE BALL
[ct=5531.381] SECURED.
[ct=5534.254] KIRK: THAT JETS SWEEP ACTION.
[ct=5537.385] ALL YOU ARE TRYING TO DO IS GET
[ct=5538.125] THE DEFENSE TO TAKE A COUPLE
[ct=5539.821] STEPS THIS WAY OFF THE EDGE.
[ct=5542.391] JUST A COUPLE STEPS DOWN, WHICH
[ct=5542.679] THEY DO.
[ct=5545.122] YOU PICK UP A NICE BLOCK ON THE
[ct=5546.865] EDGE BY THE RECEIVER, TIM JONES.
[ct=5549.227] WITH THE SPEED AND ACCELERATION
[ct=5551.565] OF ETIENNE, HE GETS TO THAT
[ct=5552.244] CORNER EMMA KRONNER HE.
[ct=5555.287] YOU GET POSITIVE YARDS.
[ct=5560.302] AL: A COUPLE OF TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=5567.103] MOVING AWAY.
[ct=5569.321] HE'S GOING TO RUN FOR THE THIRD
[ct=5569.547] TIME TONIGHT.
[ct=5573.262] SURE EVERYBODY ON THE BENCH
[ct=5574.024] WANTED HIM TO GO OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=5576.700] HE SAID NO, I'M GOING TO GET AS
[ct=5577.204] MUCH AS I CAN HEAR.
[ct=5579.719] KIRK: THE SAINTS START TO TAKE
[ct=5579.998] MORE CHANCES.
[ct=5582.242] WE TALKED ABOUT LAWRENCE.
[ct=5583.985] GOING STRAIGHT IS NO PROBLEM.
[ct=5587.660] BUT THIS, AROUND THE OTHER WAY,
[ct=5588.562] THAT GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT OF
[ct=5588.810] CONCERN.
[ct=5590.877] NO ILL EFFECTS AT ALL.
[ct=5593.878] THAT'S WHAT HEâ€™S ABLE TO DO WHEN
[ct=5594.585] HE'S HEALTHY.
[ct=5597.587] WHEN THINGS ARE NOT THERE, HE
[ct=5599.020] TAKES A HALF PLAY AND MAKES IT A
[ct=5599.658] GOOD PLAY.
[ct=5602.360] AL: SECOND AND SIX.
[ct=5613.125] DEFENSE RIGHT THERE.
[ct=5620.129] ETIENNE TAKEN DOWN FOR A TWO
[ct=5620.771] YARD LOSS.
[ct=5624.245] KIRK: THEY WIN THE LINE OF
[ct=5626.222] NOT JUST ROACH.
[ct=5628.108] LOOK HOW THEY ARE GETTING
[ct=5628.402] DOWNHILL.
[ct=5632.730] THEY ARE NOT WAITING.
[ct=5637.426] THEY ARE EXPECTING THE JAGS TO
[ct=5638.857] WORK AROUND THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=5642.532] YOU SEE WARNER FLYING DOWN TO
[ct=5643.453] STOP THE RUNNING GAME AGAINST
[ct=5643.685] ETIENNE.
[ct=5654.751] AL: JOHNSON IN THE GAME.
[ct=5656.543] HE STAYS IN TO BLOCK.
[ct=5657.382] HE PEELS OFF.
[ct=5658.921] LAWRENCE GETS TAKEN DOWN.
[ct=5661.571] BY ZACK BAUN.
[ct=5666.147] SO THE PRESSURE PUT ON AND IT IS
[ct=5671.413] AND THE CROWD COMES TO LIFE.
[ct=5674.022] KIRK: THEY STARTED TO COME TO
[ct=5674.722] LIFE AFTER THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=5677.593] I THINK THE DEFENSIVE
[ct=5679.580] COORDINATOR JOE WOODS, THE JOB
[ct=5682.028] HE'S DOING, ITâ€™S A GOOD OFFENSE
[ct=5682.613] THEY ARE FACING.
[ct=5685.299] THEY ARE MIXING UP LOOKS AT THE
[ct=5685.943] RIGHT TIME ESPECIALLY ON THIRD
[ct=5688.765] CREATING CONFUSION UP FRONT.
[ct=5690.859] AL: LOGAN COOKE.
[ct=5693.292] HIS FOURTH PUNT OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=5696.413] PLUS ONE SUCCESSFUL FAKE.
[ct=5700.189] NICE BOOT TO THE 70 YARD LINE.
[ct=5703.827] EARLY IN THE FOURTH.
[ct=5705.270] EIGHT POINT GAME.
[ct=5708.670] REALLY GOOD MATCHUP WATCHING
[ct=5715.446] JOSH ALLEN AGAINST PETE.
[ct=5719.292] GIVE PETE A LOT OF CREDIT.
[ct=5721.359] HE HAS NOT GIVEN UP ANY SACKS.
[ct=5722.066] HE'S HOLDING HIS OWN.
[ct=5724.894] I WONDER IF COMING INTO THIS
[ct=5728.201] GAME, ON AN ISLAND WHERE HE HAD
[ct=5729.210] NOT PLAYED A LOT OF FOOTBALL
[ct=5732.154] THIS YEAR, HOW HE WOULD HOLD UP.
[ct=5732.671] HE'S DOING OK.
[ct=5736.531] JOSH ALLEN HAS HAD A MONSTER
[ct=5736.712] YEAR.
[ct=5741.694] AL: SEVEN SACKS IN THE SIX GAMES
[ct=5743.516] TO THIS POINT.
[ct=5746.008] ETIENNE ON THE BENCH.
[ct=5748.206] LOOKING FOR ASAP ON HIM.
[ct=5751.706] KAMARA GOING NOWHERE.
[ct=5765.359] KIRK: WATCH 33 AND 23.
[ct=5769.026] THEY ARE ALL OVER THE RUN GAME.
[ct=5772.413] AL: CARR.
[ct=5776.188] LOBBING.
[ct=5777.870] TO THE 11 YARD LINE.
[ct=5780.398] WILLIAMS IS THERE.
[ct=5783.420] DEEP IN THEIR OWN TERRITORY,
[ct=5783.644] THIRD AND FIVE.
[ct=5792.284] BIG PLAY, YOU DON'T MAKE IT,
[ct=5793.675] LIKELY JACKSONVILLE GETS A SHORT
[ct=5794.037] FIELD OR.
[ct=5798.817] GOES DEEP, NOT EVEN CLOSE.
[ct=5803.537] FOURTH AND FIVE.
[ct=5808.649] KIRK: AGAIN A THIRD DOWN WITH A
[ct=5809.023] FRUSTRATED DEREK CARR.
[ct=5813.932] YOU SEE A LOT OF A -- YOU SEE
[ct=5815.809] OLAVE.
[ct=5818.249] A SPEEDSTER.
[ct=5820.532] HE GIVES UP.
[ct=5825.490] I THINK HE JUST EXPECTED, HE
[ct=5826.921] SAID WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
[ct=5830.034] YOU SEE A LOT OF THAT ALL YEAR.
[ct=5834.598] AL: LINE DRIVE PUNT.
[ct=5838.157] IT TAKES A GOOD NEW ORLEANS
[ct=5838.458] BOUNCE.
[ct=5841.973] EAT WATCHING THAT ON THE PLANE
[ct=5842.503] WHEREVER YOU ARE GOING.
[ct=5843.666] COLUMBUS RIGHT?
[ct=5846.465] KIRK: COLUMBUS, FOR COLLEGE GAME
[ct=5846.764] DAY.
[ct=5849.414] BACK TO TALLAHASSEE FOR FLORIDA
[ct=5849.994] STATE AND DUKE.
[ct=5852.726] AL: EASY WEEKEND FOR YOU.
[ct=5858.347] ETIENNE IS BACK, HE FLIPS THE
[ct=5858.888] BALL BACK HERE.
[ct=5864.494] KIRK: I LOVE THIS GUY, CARL
[ct=5865.405] GRANDERSON.
[ct=5872.744] WHEN YOU WATCH HIM ON DEFENSE,
[ct=5875.341] HE REALLY SHOWS UP AND PLAY IS
[ct=5875.592] SO SMART.
[ct=5880.025] THIS TIME HE'S WATCHING,
[ct=5881.130] ANTICIPATING, THINKING ABOUT
[ct=5882.101] TREVOR LAWRENCE POTENTIALLY
[ct=5883.236] COMING AROUND.
[ct=5887.011] INSTEAD HE GETS THE REVERSE.
[ct=5890.842] AL: MORE STUFF ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=5894.280] THAT KIND OF NIGHT.
[ct=5897.979] LAWRENCE GOING DEEP.
[ct=5900.315] ALONG THE SIDELINE.
[ct=5906.387] THE CATCH, RIDLEY, THE OFFICIALS
[ct=5906.933] CHECK IT OUT.
[ct=5909.372] THEY ARE GOING TO CALL IT.
[ct=5913.929] IT LOOKS LIKE THE JAGUARS WERE
[ct=5914.961] COMING UP TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE
[ct=5916.554] COMING UP TO MAKE SURE THEY DID
[ct=5918.318] NOT REVIEW IT.
[ct=5921.283] KIRK: THAT BALL LOOKS OUT OF
[ct=5921.551] BOUNDS.
[ct=5923.065] AL: IT IS.
[ct=5924.374] WAITED FOR THE CALL.
[ct=5926.617] JAGUARS THOUGHT IT WAS A CATCH.
[ct=5928.632] THEY ARE GOING TO REVIEW.
[ct=5930.131] THIRD AND 11.
[ct=5933.839] KIRK: HE CAME REALLY CLOSE TO
[ct=5934.459] MAKING ONE OF THE BEST CATCHES
[ct=5936.698] WE HAVE SEEN IN SIX WEEKS, PLUS
[ct=5937.702] ONE GAME OF THE YEAR.
[ct=5939.823] THE ONE-HANDED GRAB.
[ct=5941.365] A GREAT THROW.
[ct=5944.370] AL: THIRD DOWN AND 11.
[ct=5946.662] FIRED TOO HIGH.
[ct=5947.651] NO GOOD.
[ct=5949.248] ON THE FLAG.
[ct=5954.729] THERE IS THE FLAG ON A PASS
[ct=5955.226] INTENDED FOR AGNEW.
[ct=5969.990] KIRK: THE SAINTS ARE OUT THERE
[ct=5971.726] STATING THEIR CASE THE BALL WAS
[ct=5971.983] NOT CATCHABLE.
[ct=5974.912] >> DEFENSE, NUMBER 29.
[ct=5977.562] KIRK: IT IS AMAZING WITH ALL
[ct=5977.854] THESE RECEIVERS.
[ct=5984.506] TREVOR LAWRENCE HAS LOOKED UP
[ct=5985.313] AGNEW A LOT.
[ct=5988.214] HERE HE IS WORKING FROM A
[ct=5989.141] CONDENSED FORMATION.
[ct=5990.850] WORKS OUT AND THEN BACK IN.
[ct=5993.054] ONE THING THE SAINTS HAVE HAD A
[ct=5994.940] LOT OF HIS INTERFERENCE CALLS
[ct=5995.526] WITH THE WAY THEY PLAY.
[ct=5996.567] ALL YEAR THIS YEAR.
[ct=5999.492] SUCH TIGHT COVERAGE.
[ct=6003.516] AL: THAT IS THE 14TH PENALTY OF
[ct=6004.374] THE SEASON AGAINST THE SAINTS.
[ct=6009.664] FOR ILLEGAL CONTACT.
[ct=6012.520] IN THAT CATEGORY, ALL THREE
[ct=6015.727] CATEGORIES, DO YOU KNOW
[ct=6016.257] HOW MANY JACKSONVILLE HAS?
[ct=6018.878] ZERO.
[ct=6021.451] KIRK: I WOULD SAY IT HAS A LOT
[ct=6022.211] TO DO WITH THE WAY DENNIS ALLEN
[ct=6022.516] PLAYS.
[ct=6024.992] HE IS AS AGGRESSIVE AS ANYBODY
[ct=6025.350] IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=6028.201] THEY ARE IN THE FACE OF THE
[ct=6028.705] RECEIVERS A LOT OF TIMES.
[ct=6031.438] AL: THERE IS ETIENNE.
[ct=6034.862] EXPLOITS THAT SMALL OPENING.
[ct=6036.825] SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=6039.368] TAKING TIME OFF THE CLOCK.
[ct=6042.322] THE STOP, UNDER NINE MINUTES TO
[ct=6043.960] THIRD AND ONE.
[ct=6054.313] AL: I WOULD SAY PENNY FOR YOUR
[ct=6054.759] THOUGHTS.
[ct=6056.404] BUT I CAN FIGURE THEM OUT.
[ct=6070.945] LUNGES.
[ct=6073.239] JUST A LITTLE SHORT.
[ct=6081.583] A DEPOT IS THERE -- ADEBO IS
[ct=6085.194] KIRK: HOW ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL
[ct=6086.697] EFFORT BY ETIENNE?
[ct=6090.710] PENETRATION FORCES HIM TO BOUNCE
[ct=6091.444] IT TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=6092.732] LOOKS LIKE HE MAY GO DOWN THERE
[ct=6093.286] WITH ADEBO.
[ct=6095.858] GETS HIS HAND WITH THE BALANCE.
[ct=6098.898] HE DOES NOT EQUATE GET THE FIRST
[ct=6102.946] CLOSE -- DOES NOT QUITE GET THE
[ct=6104.980] CLOSE.
[ct=6108.197] AL: INTERESTING CALL, FOURTH AND
[ct=6108.197] INCHES.
[ct=6111.070] YOU DO NOT MAKE IT YOU GIVE THE
[ct=6111.853] SAINTS THE BALL NEAR MIDFIELD.
[ct=6114.963] THEY CAN MAKE IT AND TAKE MORE
[ct=6116.541] TIME OFF THE CLOCK.
[ct=6124.368] HE TRIED TO GET HIM.
[ct=6128.465] GOING TO BE SHORT.
[ct=6131.355] THAT SAINTS DEFENSE IN THE
[ct=6133.879] MIDDLE STEPS UP WHEN THEY HAVE
[ct=6134.121] TO.
[ct=6136.986] HUGE STOP IN AN EIGHT POINT
[ct=6139.680] KIRK: NATHAN SHEPHERD LOOKED
[ct=6142.374] LIKE HE MADE THE PLAY 93.
[ct=6144.464] HE'S TRYING TO PUSH TO HELP.
[ct=6149.959] THE QUARTERBACK SNEAK OBVIOUSLY
[ct=6150.771] THE PLAY YOU WOULD GO WITH BUT
[ct=6151.762] WITH THE KNEE INJURY YOU TAKE
[ct=6152.175] THAT AWAY.
[ct=6153.991] KIRK: THE SAINTS ARE FIRED UP.
[ct=6156.486] THEY HAVE GIVEN THEIR OFFENSE A
[ct=6159.723] IT WAS 93, WATCH HIM WORK,
[ct=6162.517] ENGAGE, LOOK INTO THE BACKFIELD,
[ct=6163.100] PUSH, AND STOP HIM RIGHT HERE.
[ct=6165.245] IF YOU ARE JACKSON YOU ARE
[ct=6167.700] THINKING, MAN, NOT HAVING OUR
[ct=6169.270] QUARTERBACK HEALTHY, NOT A GREAT
[ct=6169.628] EXCHANGE.
[ct=6171.199] SLOW DEVELOPING PLAY.
[ct=6173.161] THE SAINTS ARE ABLE TO RALLY.
[ct=6175.184] AL: EXACTLY.
[ct=6179.852] KAMARA IS THE BACK.
[ct=6183.902] CARR WITH AN OPPORTUNITY DOWN BY
[ct=6183.902] EIGHT.
[ct=6186.008] 47 YARD LINE.
[ct=6189.565] HAS TIME, THROWS, CAUGHT.
[ct=6195.932] EMMITT THOMAS AT THE 35 -- AND
[ct=6196.756] THOMAS AT THE 35 YARD LINE.
[ct=6203.819] THEY COME UP TO THE ART OF
[ct=6205.029] SCRIMMAGE -- THE LINE OF
[ct=6207.233] SCRIMMAGE AT THE 36.
[ct=6213.485] AND THE CATCH.
[ct=6220.010] JUST LIKE THAT THE SAINTS AT THE
[ct=6220.289] 17 YARD LINE.
[ct=6222.343] KIRK: NICE JOB THROWING.
[ct=6223.818] HE GETS BACK.
[ct=6227.645] BOTH THROWS, THIS TIME HE READ
[ct=6230.082] JENKINS WHO CAME DOWN FROM THE
[ct=6230.082] SAFETY SPOT.
[ct=6232.423] THROUGH PERFECTLY.
[ct=6235.760] AL: CARR TO THE END ZONE.
[ct=6241.319] MICHAEL THOMAS REACHING FOR IT.
[ct=6243.604] IS HE IN BOUNDS OR OUT?
[ct=6246.432] BUSTER BROWN IS THERE.
[ct=6250.921] WHAT A CATCH.
[ct=6254.838] KIRK: THIS TOWN, THIS STADIUM,
[ct=6255.073] THEY HAVE BEEN WAITING.
[ct=6258.250] THREE PLAYS AND A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=6262.329] THOMAS WAKES UP AND MAKES TWO
[ct=6263.158] BIG PLAYS FOR THIS SAINTS
[ct=6263.477] OFFENSE.
[ct=6269.194] DOES HE GET DOWN?
[ct=6270.825] THAT IS A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=6276.712] AL: THE OLD JOHN MADDEN LINE,
[ct=6278.860] ONE KNEE EQUALS TWO FEET.
[ct=6281.206] THAT ENDS THE PLAY.
[ct=6285.512] THE TWO-POINT CONVERSION TRY TO
[ct=6285.865] TIE THE GAME.
[ct=6287.632] KIRK: KEEP AN EYE OUT.
[ct=6291.617] AL: JAMAAL WILLIAMS THE RUNNING
[ct=6293.271] THERE IS HILL.
[ct=6295.237] KAMARA COMING TO THE INSIDE.
[ct=6298.710] KAMARA, TIE GAME.
[ct=6312.353] THAT IS A LEAP AND A HALF.
[ct=6314.515] HE'S GOING TO GET TO THE SECOND
[ct=6314.789] ROW.
[ct=6319.079] KIRK: THAT IS THE BEST THIS
[ct=6319.744] OFFENSE HAS LOOKED.
[ct=6323.469] SAVED IT FOR THE BEST TIME IN
[ct=6325.826] THE GAME, THE TOUCHDOWN ON THE
[ct=6326.306] PREVIOUS DRIVE TO GET THE BALL
[ct=6327.365] BACK AFTER A STOP.
[ct=6328.427] THEY DO NOT MAKE IT ON FOURTH
[ct=6334.020] BOY DID NEW ORLEANS TAKE
[ct=6334.553] ADVANTAGE OF GREAT FIELD
[ct=6337.017] WATCH THE QUARTERBACK.
[ct=6340.776] PITCH, FALLS OUT, HELPS THE
[ct=6342.939] OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=6343.619] THE TEMPO, THE QUICK RELEASE.
[ct=6347.758] MICHAEL THOMAS REMINDING THE NFL
[ct=6350.915] COMMUNITY AROUND THE COUNTRY, 13
[ct=6351.770] STILL MAKES BIG PLAYS FOR THE
[ct=6360.901] AL: HIS FIRST TOUCHDOWN OF THE
[ct=6363.412] KAMARA WITH A TWO POINTER.
[ct=6370.276] AT 24,9, YOU ARE GOING, NO WAY,
[ct=6371.476] BUT THEY LOOK AWFUL.
[ct=6376.653] AND THEN YOU GO THREE PLAYS, 51
[ct=6378.085] SECONDS.
[ct=6382.771] KIRK: THIS PLACE IS ALIVE NOW.
[ct=6386.041] AL: CROWD GOES WILD.
[ct=6389.787] AND NOW JACKSONVILLE ALL OF A
[ct=6392.830] SUDDEN VICTORY IN THEIR HIP
[ct=6396.464] POCKET.
[ct=6396.464] TIED GAME.
[ct=6397.119] 6:38 TO GO.
[ct=6400.320] KIRK: I SAID TO YOU EARLIER, WE
[ct=6402.757] FOCUSED ON THE SAINTS AND WHAT
[ct=6405.263] THEY NEED TO DO, BUT THIS
[ct=6405.834] JACKSONVILLE TEAM THINKS THEY
[ct=6407.040] WILL BE A POSTSEASON TEAM.
[ct=6411.020] THEY ARE STILL A YOUNG TEAM
[ct=6411.869] LEARNING HOW TO BE A WINNING
[ct=6412.273] FOOTBALL TEAM.
[ct=6415.613] A 24-9 LEAD, AND NOW THEY WILL
[ct=6417.648] HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT TO GET OUT
[ct=6418.699] OF HERE WITH A WIN.
[ct=6422.953] AL: PUT THEIR FOOT OFF THE GAS
[ct=6425.932] THEY WILL TRY TO DO IT AGAIN
[ct=6429.758] HERE, FOUR YARD PICK UP, MAYBE
[ct=6431.351] FIVE TO EVAN INGRAM, CLOSE TO
[ct=6431.715] THE 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=6433.275] THEY MAKE A TACKLE.
[ct=6437.533] KIRK: I THOUGHT TO COMING INTO
[ct=6440.709] THE NIGHT, THE MATCHUP FAVORED
[ct=6442.923] JACKSONVILLE'S OFFENSE WITH
[ct=6445.253] CHRISTIAN KIRK IN THE SLOT AND
[ct=6447.227] WOULD BE SURPRISED TO SEE THEM
[ct=6447.648] CREATE MATCHUPS AND TRY TO GET
[ct=6450.013] HIM ISOLATED, HE AND EVAN INGRAM
[ct=6451.416] BOTH.
[ct=6463.441] AL: LAWRENCE.
[ct=6465.360] HE WILL RUN AGAIN.
[ct=6466.932] A LOT OF ROOM.
[ct=6468.499] THERE HE GOES.
[ct=6471.914] WHAT A NIGHT HE HAS HAD AS A
[ct=6471.914] RUSHER.
[ct=6477.310] SPRAINED KNEE, NO PRACTICE, DID
[ct=6479.136] NOT TAKE ANY CONTACT, AND
[ct=6480.010] TONIGHT HE HAS CARRIED THE BALL
[ct=6482.369] FIVE LINES FOR 63 YARDS.
[ct=6485.875] KIRK: LOOK AT THE LINEBACKERS,
[ct=6487.733] THE LAST THING THEY'RE WORRIED
[ct=6488.180] ABOUT HIS TREVOR LAWRENCE
[ct=6488.459] RUNNING.
[ct=6489.996] THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME IT HAS
[ct=6490.297] CAUGHT UP TO THEM.
[ct=6492.901] WE HAVE HEARD ALL WEEK, IS
[ct=6493.233] TREVOR GOING TO PLAY?
[ct=6496.553] HE HAS THAT KNEE, PROBABLY WILL
[ct=6497.157] NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE MUCH.
[ct=6500.589] WORMLEY, YOU ARE AWARE OF HIM
[ct=6501.630] BUT TONIGHT THEY ARE NOT
[ct=6502.059] CONCERNED.
[ct=6504.400] THEY PLAY MAN UNDERNEATH AND
[ct=6505.667] THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT HOME TO
[ct=6506.243] TAKE 16.
[ct=6508.697] AL: THAT WAS A 23 YARD GAME.
[ct=6510.960] FLIPPING IT TO RIDLEY.
[ct=6512.900] AND HE CANNOT GET AROUND THE
[ct=6513.989] OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=6521.452] KIRK: MARCUS MAY READ THIS FROM
[ct=6521.452] THE BEGINNING.
[ct=6525.220] HE LOOKED -- WATCH HIS EYES AND
[ct=6530.171] AWARENESS TO SAY, HE HAS TO TAKE
[ct=6530.171] OFF.
[ct=6532.682] REALLY, HE COULD COVER GROUND.
[ct=6533.270] HE IS VERY FAST.
[ct=6536.180] MAY ASK A GREAT PLAY THAT TIME
[ct=6539.506] BY NOT GETTING LONG TO SLEEP.
[ct=6540.331] YOU WANT TO FLY THE BALL THE
[ct=6542.436] OTHER WAY, BUT HE STAYED HOME
[ct=6542.692] AND WAS PATIENT.
[ct=6546.387] AL: IN ANGER COULD NOT BLOCKING.
[ct=6550.943] -- EVAN INGRAM COULD NOT BLOCK
[ct=6554.159] IN THERE FOR RIDLEY.
[ct=6556.053] THIRD AND 10.
[ct=6561.369] OUT OF PLAY.
[ct=6565.941] 4:43.
[ct=6575.144] EVERYBODY HAS GOT IT ROLLING,
[ct=6575.553] TWO MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=6576.666] 24-24 GAME.
[ct=6583.194] THIRD DOWN AND 10.
[ct=6594.618] DEEP DRIVE, DEEP THROW.
[ct=6599.836] RIDLEY THE INTENDED RECEIVER.
[ct=6606.259] ADEBO THERE, AND THE SAINTS'
[ct=6606.862] DEFENSE HOLDS.
[ct=6608.994] KIRK: HEREâ€™
[ct=6609.383] KIRK: HERE'S A CONDENSED
[ct=6610.609] FORMATION AND HE TAKES HIMSELF
[ct=6610.845] OUT OF THE PLAY.
[ct=6615.590] LOOK AT THIS ROUTE.
[ct=6616.349] HE IS ALMOST TO THE SIDELINE.
[ct=6619.716] YOU NEED SOME ROOM TO BE ABLE TO
[ct=6621.247] THROW YOUR RECEIVER OUT TO HIS
[ct=6624.168] OUTSIDE SHOULDER, BUT HE RAN
[ct=6625.806] HIMSELF SO CLOSE TO THE SIDELINE
[ct=6627.153] THAT THERE WAS REALLY NOWHERE
[ct=6627.589] LAWRENCE COULD PUT THE BALL.
[ct=6631.327] AL: LOGAN COOKE, PUNT NUMBER
[ct=6631.692] FIVE TONIGHT.
[ct=6636.296] 10 YARD LINE.
[ct=6644.232] 4:30 LEFT IN REGULATION.
[ct=6653.018] A SCORING DRIVE, THOMAS, DOWN
[ct=6653.707] THE RIGHT SIDELINE.
[ct=6657.863] AND THEN SIX POINTS.
[ct=6663.559] KIRK: THAT'S THE BEST THE
[ct=6664.825] OFFENSE HAS LOOKED IN WEEKS, AND
[ct=6665.600] IT WAS THREE PLAYS.
[ct=6669.635] IT IS SO FRUSTRATING.
[ct=6670.198] YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE CAPABLE
[ct=6670.441] OF DOING.
[ct=6673.450] THEY HAVE GREAT INDIVIDUAL
[ct=6674.457] PLAYERS BUT IT IS A MATTER OF
[ct=6675.416] ALL COMING TOGETHER.
[ct=6677.999] AL: FROM THE 10.
[ct=6683.585] HE THROWS.
[ct=6685.327] IT IS DROPPED.
[ct=6687.964] JOSH ALLEN GOT TO CARR.
[ct=6692.216] INCOMPLETE, SECOND DOWN AND 10.
[ct=6695.144] KIRK: IT IS A GOOD JOB.
[ct=6696.890] THIS IS YOUR FEAR, THE WHOLE
[ct=6699.094] GAME IS, CAN ALLEN TURNED THE
[ct=6699.519] CORNER?
[ct=6702.571] HEY DENNIS, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE
[ct=6702.995] STRENGTH OF DEREK CARR?
[ct=6706.776] THE BALL WAS THROWN WELL ENOUGH,
[ct=6707.142] CONSIDERING HE GOT HIT AS SEE
[ct=6708.189] THREW IT.
[ct=6713.214] AL: HILL IS KNOCKED DOWN AT THE
[ct=6718.093] OLUOKUN MAKES THE STOP.
[ct=6724.973] GOING QUICKLY.
[ct=6733.231] CARR, LOOK OUT.
[ct=6733.231] ESCAPES.
[ct=6738.061] THROWS ON THE RUN.
[ct=6742.093] THAT TIME, OLUOKUN GLITCHING.
[ct=6745.413] CARR NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN BENT
[ct=6747.033] OVER ON THE SIDELINE, OF ALL
[ct=6747.363] THINGS.
[ct=6750.548] DOWN CARR CARR TO BOTH KNEES HE
[ct=6750.548] GOES.
[ct=6753.455] TOOK A SHOT -- DOWN TO BOTH
[ct=6753.757] KNEES HE GOES.
[ct=6755.072] CARR TOOK A SHOT.
[ct=6757.529] KIRK: HE WAS TRYING TO DO
[ct=6759.350] ANYTHING TO KEEP OLUOKUN THAT
[ct=6759.692] PLAY ALIVE.
[ct=6761.617] OLUOKUNCAME RIGHT UP KAMARA THE
[ct=6763.574] YOU THINK KAMARA WOULD COME OVER
[ct=6765.040] HERE AND PICK THIS UP, BUT HE IS
[ct=6767.148] READY TO TRY TO GET OUT OF THE
[ct=6768.342] BACKFIELD FOR A CHECK DOWN, SO
[ct=6770.151] NOBODY PICKS UP OLUOKUN.
[ct=6770.894] THERE HE IS WITH THE SPEED.
[ct=6774.764] YOU CAN SEE SHAHEED BREAKING
[ct=6776.708] THERE, BUT BY THE TIME HE SAW
[ct=6777.271] HIM, THAT IS A TOUGH THROW TO
[ct=6778.066] MAKE.
[ct=6781.093] AL: REACHING FOR THE GROIN.
[ct=6783.725] GOING DOWN.
[ct=6784.063] STILL DOWN.
[ct=6791.051] WEEK THREE, CAME BACK THE NEXT
[ct=6793.442] WEEK TRYING TO WORK THIS ONE
[ct=6801.566] WE HAVE SEEN IT THROUGH THE
[ct=6801.566] YEARS.
[ct=6802.754] A TOUGH BREAK.
[ct=6815.144] SO IN COMES THE PUNT GROUP, THE
[ct=6816.239] ROOKIE PUNTER.
[ct=6818.592] FOURTH OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=6820.010] LINE DRIVE.
[ct=6822.269] HE CATCHES IT ON THE RUN.
[ct=6825.702] HERE OVER THE FINAL
[ct=6826.943] 3:45 OF REGULATION?
[ct=6830.947] ONLY 12 PASSING YARDS IN THE
[ct=6835.473] AND FROM THE 46, SWINGS IT OUT
[ct=6835.752] TO ETIENNE.
[ct=6839.863] AND THEN GOES NEXT TO NOWHERE,
[ct=6840.743] TAKING OUT OF BOUNDS BY TAYLOR.
[ct=6842.836] SECOND AND 8.
[ct=6846.842] KIRK: WHAT I AM INTERESTED TO
[ct=6848.173] SEE IS WHAT PRESS TAYLOR COMES
[ct=6851.159] UP WITH WITH HIS PLAN HERE WITH
[ct=6853.395] 3:30 TO GO ON A TIED GAME, BOTH
[ct=6857.264] TEAMS, FULLY COMPLEMENTED AND
[ct=6857.853] THE TWO MINUTE WARNING IS OUT
[ct=6860.742] THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT POINTS
[ct=6861.715] AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO GET THIS
[ct=6862.350] AS CLOSE AS THEY CAN BUT I WOULD
[ct=6864.499] THINK IT IS A COMBINATION OF A
[ct=6867.008] COUPLE OF FIRST DOWNS, WORK THE
[ct=6868.288] CLOCK AND TRY TO MAKE THE SAINTS
[ct=6868.549] USE THOSE TIMEOUTS.
[ct=6872.217] AL: TAYLOR IS BACKING AWAY.
[ct=6880.930] THE HEAD COACH OF THE BENGALS.
[ct=6889.275] WHEELS TURNING, SPINNING.
[ct=6906.247] MIGHT BE :00 -- CLOCK OFFICIAL.
[ct=6909.623] REFEREE: THE GAME IS STOPPED TO
[ct=6910.019] CONFIRM THE TIME.
[ct=6933.432] LAWRENCE FIERS.
[ct=6933.975] THAT IS CAUGHT ON THE RUN.
[ct=6938.313] CHRISTIAN KIRK INSIDE THE 20
[ct=6938.977] READ HE GOES, AND CHRISTIAN KIRK
[ct=6940.561] KEEPS THE BALL ALL THE WAY TO
[ct=6942.608] ABOUT THE 1-YARD LINE.
[ct=6947.432] THEY'RE GOING TO SPOT IT AS HE
[ct=6950.800] THINKS HE SCORED THE TOUCHDOWN,
[ct=6951.567] AND THEY'RE GOING TO CALL IT A
[ct=6951.940] TOUCHDOWN NOW.
[ct=6957.582] 44 YARDS PER CHRISTIAN KIRK.
[ct=6958.123] INTO THE END ZONE HE GOES.
[ct=6962.848] KIRK: WATCH THE ROUTE HERE
[ct=6963.533] AGAINST TYRANN MATHIEU.
[ct=6966.969] GIVE HIM THAT OPTION ROUND,
[ct=6968.781] BASED ON LEVERAGE TO WORK IN OR
[ct=6971.285] THAT IS A MISMATCH AT THIS STAGE
[ct=6971.626] IN TIME.
[ct=6974.812] KIRK HAD SUCH QUICKNESS AND A
[ct=6975.401] FIELD ON THE ROUTES.
[ct=6981.182] -- FEEL ON THE ROUTES.
[ct=6983.777] AL: THEY COMPLETELY STYMIED
[ct=6986.497] OFFENSIVELY IN THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=6993.417] IT TOOK 51 SECONDS TO GET THE
[ct=6997.029] TYING TOUCH, AND THIS TOOK
[ct=6997.855] SECONDS FOR TWO PLAYS.
[ct=7001.691] KIRK: HE GOES IN, BACK OUT AND
[ct=7002.028] THEN BACK TO THE INSIDE.
[ct=7005.117] LOOK HOW HE SEPARATES WITH A
[ct=7005.382] BALL IN HIS HANDS.
[ct=7014.302] JUST KIND OF A CRUISE' -- A
[ct=7016.321] PRO'S PRO IN HOW THEY GET READY
[ct=7016.321] FOR A GAME.
[ct=7019.487] AGAIN, I FELT THE MATCHUP
[ct=7020.759] AGAINST THE INSIDE DEFENSIVE
[ct=7024.243] BACKS, WHETHER IT WAS TAYLOR OR
[ct=7026.653] MATTHEW COMING DOWN, THAT
[ct=7027.627] EVENTUALLY LAWRENCE WOULD HAVE A
[ct=7029.135] CHANCE TO HIT A BIG ONE LATE IN
[ct=7029.508] THE GAME.
[ct=7033.596] KIRK FINALLY MAKES HIS PRESENCE
[ct=7034.050] FELT.
[ct=7040.765] AL: CAMERON JORDAN CAN ONLY LOOK
[ct=7042.697] AT THAT REPLAY.
[ct=7049.229] DEREK CARR, CAN HE LEAD THEM
[ct=7054.012] DOWN THE FIELD AGAIN? CRAZY GAME
[ct=7054.253] IN SO MANY WAYS.
[ct=7065.465] A TOUCHDOWN AND A PICK FOR DEREK
[ct=7067.923] KIRK: THE ONE TIME THEY REALLY
[ct=7071.374] LOOKED INSYNC, THEY WERE IN THAT
[ct=7072.754] TEMPO MODE, AND THEY WERE GOING
[ct=7073.953] FAST, AND HE WAS GETTING THE
[ct=7075.580] BALL OUT OF HIS HANDS QUICK, AND
[ct=7076.177] THEY WERE THE AGGRESSOR.
[ct=7079.993] THE JAGS WERE SITTING BACK,
[ct=7080.914] LOOKING TO EACH OTHER TO MAKE
[ct=7083.569] SURE THEY WERE ON THE SAME PAGE,
[ct=7084.600] AND YOU WILL SEE WITH MORE OF
[ct=7087.401] THAT WITH 3:08 TO GO.
[ct=7095.784] AL: OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=7095.784] WIDE OPEN.
[ct=7096.247] CAUGHT.
[ct=7100.006] TACKLED AT ABOUT THE 43 KIRK:
[ct=7100.006] KIRK:, HILL.
[ct=7102.745] FINALLY AN ANSWER, THAT SPLIT
[ct=7104.741] SAFETY LOOK TO GET THEY GET
[ct=7105.584] BEHIND THE BACKERS AND IN
[ct=7107.861] BETWEEN THE SAFETIES.
[ct=7108.754] ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES WE HAVE
[ct=7110.202] SEEN THEM HIT A VERTICAL SHOT
[ct=7110.202] DOWN THE MIDDLE.
[ct=7114.800] AL: HIS FOURTH CATCH OF THE
[ct=7115.046] NIGHT.
[ct=7117.320] RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE.
[ct=7120.791] TO JAGUAR TERRITORY GOES KAMARA.
[ct=7123.050] KIRK: THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL THING
[ct=7127.501] WHEN YOU HIT HILL LIKE THAT
[ct=7127.861] BEHIND THOSE BACKERS, THEY
[ct=7128.430] FINALLY START TO SINK.
[ct=7129.888] AND THEN YOU CAN CHECK IT DOWN
[ct=7131.935] TO KAMARA, AND HE HAS MORE ROOM
[ct=7131.935] TO WORK.
[ct=7135.420] AL: THEY ARE SHY INCHES.
[ct=7139.551] KAMARA AGAIN, FIRST DOWN.
[ct=7142.826] TO THE 41 HE GOES.
[ct=7146.676] TAKING DOWN THE TWO MINUTE
[ct=7146.676] WARNING.
[ct=7156.344] AND HD, ALL THREE TIMEOUTS.
[ct=7160.590] KIRK: HE HAS HAD A LITTLE BIT OF
[ct=7161.290] HE CHECKS OUT NOW.
[ct=7162.701] YOU CAN SEE JAMAAL WILLIAMS BACK
[ct=7168.641] IN, LOOKS
[ct=7169.382] BETTER DURING THE WEEK.
[ct=7172.455] SAMUEL, THE SAME THING.
[ct=7174.723] INSIDE TWO MINUTES NOW.
[ct=7178.741] SINCE GO TO WORK.
[ct=7182.411] FLIPPING OUT HERE.
[ct=7188.277] SHAHEED, SECOND DOWN AND SHORT.
[ct=7192.649] KIRK: CARR AND THIS FOURTH
[ct=7196.470] QUARTER, NINE OF 12, 95 YARDS
[ct=7197.432] AND A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=7211.186] AL: KAMARA INSIDE THE 20 HE
[ct=7218.048] TACKLED.
[ct=7218.888] GAME OF 15.
[ct=7224.364] KIRK: BUT THE DEFENSIVE LINE
[ct=7224.972] TOOK THEMSELVES OUT OF THE PLAY,
[ct=7225.503] AND THE OFFENSIVE LINE ABLE TO
[ct=7226.274] GET UP TO THOSE BACKERS, GETTING
[ct=7226.707] KAMARA SOME ROOM.
[ct=7230.746] AL: CARR ESCAPES.
[ct=7232.462] FIERS IT AWAY.
[ct=7235.973] -- FIRES IT AWAY.
[ct=7239.554] WE HAD A LOW-SCORING GAME, WHICH
[ct=7240.958] HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH MAINLY
[ct=7241.324] THE SAINTS THIS YEAR.
[ct=7246.708] YOU ARE LIVING LARGE IF YOU LIKE
[ct=7248.013] THE UNDER, BUT NOT TONIGHT.
[ct=7251.525] THEY HAVE ONLY HAD ONE GAME
[ct=7252.249] WHERE THEY SCORED OVER 20
[ct=7252.249] POINTS.
[ct=7254.947] AL: RIGHT.
[ct=7272.351] AL: SECOND AND 10.
[ct=7275.731] THAT IS CAUGHT, TAKING IT TO THE
[ct=7277.615] OLUOKUN, THIRD DOWN.
[ct=7280.970] --OLAVE, THIRD DOWN.
[ct=7283.639] KIRK: HE MOTIONED FROM THE LEFT
[ct=7286.000] TO THE RIGHT, WIDENED OUT DEVIN
[ct=7287.850] LLOYD, WHO FOLLOWED HIM AND THEN
[ct=7288.462] WENT UNDERNEATH ON THAT ANGLE
[ct=7291.213] AL: THIRD DOWN AND 2.
[ct=7296.364] HE HAS GOT THE FIRST.
[ct=7298.257] THE SIX YARD LINE.
[ct=7300.827] KIRK: LET'S GIVE THIS OFFENSE OF
[ct=7301.101] LINE CREDIT.
[ct=7303.846] WE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONING THEM
[ct=7304.664] ALL NIGHT WHEN IT COMES TO PASS
[ct=7306.119] PROTECTION AND THEY ARE FINALLY
[ct=7306.502] GETTING A LITTLE PUSH UP FRONT.
[ct=7308.863] AL: WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THE
[ct=7309.190] TIMEOUT STRATEGY.
[ct=7311.689] YOU REALLY DO NOT WANT TO TAKE A
[ct=7313.547] TIMEOUT AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO
[ct=7315.397] TAKE IT IF YOU ARE NEW ORLEANS
[ct=7316.306] EITHER AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO
[ct=7318.673] LEAVE JACKSONVILLE, SO EACH TEAM
[ct=7321.309] STILL HAS ALL OF ITS TIMEOUTS,
[ct=7321.309] AND THAT PASSES INCOMPLETE.
[ct=7324.006] IT IS ONE OF THOSE WEIRD DEALS
[ct=7325.869] WHERE NOBODY ONES TO REALLY TAKE
[ct=7326.115] A TIMEOUT.
[ct=7328.738] KIRK: YOU ARE RIGHT.
[ct=7330.427] JACKSONVILLE IS THINKING, THE
[ct=7331.656] WAY THEY ARE IN THE RED ZONE,
[ct=7334.627] LET THE CLOCK KEEP GOING.
[ct=7335.938] THEY ARE THINKING, WE DO NOT
[ct=7337.357] WANT TO GIVE TREVOR LAWRENCE ANY
[ct=7337.633] TIME LEFT.
[ct=7341.239] AL: THE BIG QUESTION IS IF NEW
[ct=7341.640] ORLEANS GETS INTO THE END ZONE,
[ct=7345.236] DOES ALLEN GO FOR TWO?
[ct=7348.158] FIRST THINGS FIRST, SECOND DOWN
[ct=7348.782] AND GOAL.
[ct=7361.490] TIME RUNNING OUT.
[ct=7361.886] AVOIDS THE SACK.
[ct=7363.530] FIERS.
[ct=7366.669] SCENTED FOR HILL.
[ct=7369.878] YOU HAVE ALLEN GOING DOWN, ALL
[ct=7370.591] SORTS OF ACTION HERE.
[ct=7373.339] CARR GETS UP.
[ct=7376.798] HOBBLES A LITTLE.
[ct=7378.142] NEEDS A MOMENT.
[ct=7379.809] BENDS OVER.
[ct=7382.067] KIRK: THERE IS THAT MATCHUP
[ct=7385.798] AGAIN WITH PETE AGAINST ALLEN.
[ct=7388.818] WHEN CARR HAS HAD SUCCESS, IT IS
[ct=7389.370] NOT WHEN HE IS BACK IN THE
[ct=7392.489] POCKET WAITING FOR RECEIVERS TO
[ct=7394.216] GET OPEN, IT IS WHEN HE HAS A
[ct=7398.104] HITCH IN THE BALL OUT, THAT TIME
[ct=7399.448] HOLDING THE BALL IN THE AREA
[ct=7400.894] USUALLY DOES NOT LEAD TO SUCCESS
[ct=7404.863] FOR ANY OFFENSE, BUT ESPECIALLY
[ct=7405.621] THIS OFFENSE THAT HAS STRUGGLED
[ct=7406.023] IN THE RED AREA.
[ct=7408.373] AL: CARR NEEDED AN EXTRA MOMENT.
[ct=7415.524] SO JUST TO REGROUP, GET SETTLED,
[ct=7417.091] FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY WILL DO AT
[ct=7433.207] KIRK: WAIT, 24-NINE, I DON'T
[ct=7433.670] THINK ANYBODY EXPECTED THIS.
[ct=7436.645] AL: NO, NEW ORLEANS LOOK LIKE
[ct=7437.119] THEY WOULD NOT SCORE FOR A
[ct=7437.531] MONTH.
[ct=7440.714] A GAME BROKE OUT.
[ct=7443.578] A BONANZA BROKE OUT.
[ct=7446.924] THEY PUT KEITH KIRKWOOD IN THE
[ct=7449.900] WE HAVE BARELY SEEN HIM TONIGHT.
[ct=7451.901] HE GOES WIDE TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=7453.480] THIRD AND GOAL.
[ct=7464.377] TO THE END, OFF THE FINGERTIPS
[ct=7465.198] OF MOREAU!
[ct=7469.481] COULD NOT HOLD IT IN, SETTING UP
[ct=7470.192] A FOURTH AND GOAL.
[ct=7471.761] SO CLOSE.
[ct=7474.640] KIRK: PERFECTLY TIMED.
[ct=7476.776] THE EXECUTION WAS THERE.
[ct=7478.104] THE ONE HITCH BALL OUT.
[ct=7480.247] THIS COMMUNICATION BY THE JAGS.
[ct=7484.369] TWO DEFENDERS -- WATCH BOTH,
[ct=7487.083] JENKINS AND BROWN, 30 AND 2 JUST
[ct=7488.247] SIT UP FRONT, BIG HOLE IN THE
[ct=7488.247] FRONT.
[ct=7490.841] CARR READ IT PERFECTLY IN THE
[ct=7491.107] BALL IS JUST DROP.
[ct=7495.265] AL: THE SAINTS ARE 4-5 ON THIRD
[ct=7495.709] DOWN TONIGHT.
[ct=7499.771] ON FOURTH.
[ct=7503.570] FOURTH AND GOAL, FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=7504.725] AGAIN TO THE END ZONE.
[ct=7505.664] CONTACT.
[ct=7508.221] THE PASSES RULED INCOMPLETE.
[ct=7511.218] EVERYBODY WANTS IN THE STADIUM A
[ct=7515.634] YOU HAVE LESTER BROWN THERE WITH
[ct=7516.028] CHRIS OLIVA A, ALL LEGAL.
[ct=7521.044] AND THE JAGS BEGAN TO CELEBRATE.
[ct=7526.105] KIRK: WITH THE GAME ON THE LINE,
[ct=7528.618] YOU GO TO YOUR TOP RECEIVER
[ct=7529.093] AGAINST A BACKUP CORNER WHO WAS
[ct=7532.152] IN FOR TYSON CAMPBELL WHO HAS
[ct=7533.430] HELD HIS OWN TONIGHT, AND HE
[ct=7535.551] DOES IT AGAIN.
[ct=7537.472] LET'S GIVE HIM A LOT OF CREDIT,
[ct=7537.782] SECOND-YEAR OUT OF ARKANSAS.
[ct=7541.090] DOES IT GIVE THEM A LITTLE
[ct=7541.466] WIGGLE?
[ct=7544.924] TRIES TO GET AROUND AND NEVER
[ct=7545.203] HAS A CHANCE.
[ct=7549.402] BROWN PLAYED THE BALL
[ct=7550.008] PERFECTLY, AND HE PUT IT UP AND
[ct=7552.115] HE THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO
[ct=7554.230] WORK AROUND HIM BUT TO GOOD OF
[ct=7556.418] COVERAGE FROM BUSTER BROWN.
[ct=7566.346] IF ONLY THAT ONE WOULD HAVE
[ct=7569.636] FOUND ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE IN THE
[ct=7570.235] ARMS OF MOREAU.
[ct=7572.704] AL: THE SAINTS HAVE A COUPLE OF
[ct=7576.918] TIMEOUTS, BUT YOU CANNOT
[ct=7578.558] UNFORCED A PUNT.
[ct=7580.407] THAT KIND OF THE NIGHT FOR THE
[ct=7580.945] FIGHT BACK.
[ct=7583.258] MOREAU KNOWS IT WAS OFF HIS
[ct=7583.566] FINGERTIPS.
[ct=7586.890] AND THE SAINTS WILL AT LEAST
[ct=7587.300] TAKE A
