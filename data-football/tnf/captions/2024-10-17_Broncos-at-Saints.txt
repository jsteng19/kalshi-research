[ct=4.172] TO BE WHO WE WANT TO BE.
[ct=9.679] >> DREW BREES WILL BE INDUCTED
[ct=10.985] TONIGHT.
[ct=13.681] LOOK AT THOSE GUYS.
[ct=20.301] A JACK OF ALL TRADES, AND THERE
[ct=22.982] IS DEREK CARR.
[ct=28.342] HE HAD A LINE WHERE YOU SAID
[ct=29.626] CRIME THE RIVER.
[ct=37.587] MEANWHILE THERE IS SEAN PAYTON,
[ct=42.862] HIS RECORD, WINNING SUPER BOWL
[ct=46.858] 44, TRAILING AND THEN A KICK
[ct=49.598] TURNED THEY GAINED AROUND
[ct=49.598] AGAINST THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS.
[ct=54.824] THE SAINTS WILL DEFER SO DENVER
[ct=60.871] WILL START ON OFFENSE YOU GOT A
[ct=67.382] KICKOFF, TREMONT SMITH BACK TO
[ct=67.609] RECEIVE.
[ct=72.890] PACKED HOUSE AT THE SUPERDOME,
[ct=75.227] CELEBRATING ITS 50TH YEAR NEXT
[ct=75.525] SEASON.
[ct=81.106] THIS ENABLES A RUN BACK FROM
[ct=85.183] MARVIN TO COVER THE SIDELINE AND
[ct=85.837] GET TAKEN OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=90.533] SO HERE IS THE NUMBER SIX
[ct=94.487] OVERALL PICK IN THE DRAFT AND
[ct=96.422] SIX QUARTERBACK PICK.
[ct=101.901] HE ONLY HAD ONE TOUCHDOWN IN THE
[ct=105.188] FIRST FOUR GAMES IN THE LAST
[ct=107.742] TWO, HE'S 5-5.
[ct=110.366] A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO COVER
[ct=110.632] HIM.
[ct=115.211] >> HE DREAMED HIS WHOLE LIFE OF
[ct=121.149] PLAYING THEIR, ENDS UP IN
[ct=124.594] OREGON, TWO GREAT YEARS, FIRST
[ct=124.937] ROUND PICK FOR DENVER.
[ct=133.183] >> A TON OF EXPERIENCE, THERE HE
[ct=133.183] GOES.
[ct=139.819] HE CAN RUN, HE HAS PROVEN THAT.
[ct=145.143] >> THAT IS SOMETHING FOR A TEAM
[ct=146.437] THAT IS STRUGGLING, THEY HAD
[ct=153.102] BETTER BE READY FOR SHOCK --
[ct=153.102] SEAN PAYTON.
[ct=157.254] HIS INSTINCT IS TO TAKE OFF
[ct=159.735] WITHOUT ONE WAS WIDE OPEN.
[ct=174.398] >> MARVIN IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=183.699] MINIMUM GAIN IF ANY.
[ct=191.902] >> THIS IS AN OFFENSE WITH
[ct=193.265] ROOKIE QUARTERBACK AND ROOKIE
[ct=193.265] RECEIVERS.
[ct=198.544] FRANKLIN TO GO ALONG WITH SUDDEN
[ct=201.213] , THE PLAYMAKER.
[ct=205.247] THEY ARE TRYING TO CHANGE LOOKS
[ct=205.247] UP.
[ct=211.318] >> WILLIAMS WITH A PISTOL.
[ct=215.343] FAKE IT TO HIM AND BO NIX GETS
[ct=216.195] THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=220.121] THE BLOCK FROM MICHAEL BURTON
[ct=224.372] AND --
[ct=229.560] >> DEFENSE WILL HAVE TO BE AWARE
[ct=233.759] OF HIS ABILITY TO COME DOWN,
[ct=234.322] PICKS UP A NICE BLOCK.
[ct=241.008] COUPLE OF PLAYS, BO NIX GETTING
[ct=243.580] AN IDEA OF WHAT CAN DO, SPRINKLE
[ct=246.456] IN IRAN WERE TO CALL THE
[ct=250.463] NORMALLY IT IS CREATED BY BUYING
[ct=253.055] IN SOME TIME.
[ct=258.382] >> RAZZLE-DAZZLE HERE AND HE
[ct=259.724] FINDS THE OPEN MAN BUT CANNOT
[ct=261.095] HIT HIM.
[ct=265.088] WIDE OPEN IS LUCAS, NUMBER THREE
[ct=267.704] TIGHT END WIDE OPEN, OVERTH
[ct=271.711] >> GREAT JOB WAY FOR HIM TO
[ct=275.765] CLEAR, BUT YOU WILL SEE HIS
[ct=279.694] FEET, THIS IS THE BIGGEST
[ct=279.694] CONCERN.
[ct=283.678] OFF-BALANCE, NOT ABLE TO GET HIS
[ct=284.969] FEET SECURED.
[ct=291.605] STEP UP IS FINE, NOW MAKE AN
[ct=291.605] ACCURATE THROW.
[ct=295.577] HE IS AN ACCURATE PASSER BUT
[ct=296.914] THROWING THE BALL DOWNFIELD HE
[ct=298.252] HAS NOT DONE A GOOD JOB.
[ct=303.582] >> SECOND DOWN AND 10, GOES
[ct=304.847] AGAINST THE GRAIN, THROWS
[ct=304.847] AGAINST THE GRAIN.
[ct=310.180] INTENDED FOR FRANKLIN, T
[ct=311.566] DOWN AND 10.
[ct=315.551] >> HE HAD FRANKLIN PULLING AWAY
[ct=318.179] FROM HIS DEFENDER, HE HAD HIM
[ct=324.880] OPEN AND THE OPTION, PROBABLY
[ct=324.880] COULD HAVE GOTTEN ANOTHER BIG
[ct=327.579] RUN WHEN HE GOT OUTSIDE.
[ct=332.854] >> THIS TIME THEY SPREAD IT OUT.
[ct=339.496] RECEIVERS TO THE LEFT, BRINGING
[ct=339.496] WILLIAMS BACK INTO THE
[ct=340.810] BACKFIELD.
[ct=347.428] PLAY CLOCK AT TWO MINUTES AND
[ct=351.492] THIRD AND 10, INCOMPLETE BECAUSE
[ct=355.509] OF THE PRESSURE AND QUICK FIRST
[ct=356.748] DOWNS FOLLOWED BY A PUNT.
[ct=362.056] >> TAYLOR DID A GOOD JOB
[ct=364.742] DISGUISING THE PRESSURE AND THEN
[ct=366.043] PRESSURE FROM THE
[ct=367.346] THE BALL SNAPPED PRESSURE CAME
[ct=372.680] FROM THE OTHER SIDE, YOU CAN SEE
[ct=374.034] HOW OPEN THE TIGHT END IS BUT
[ct=380.645] THE PRESSURE AFFECTED HIM.
[ct=388.677] >> DIXON IS EARNING HIS KEEP.
[ct=395.248] FAIR>> HAVE YOU EVER BEEN?
[ct=397.976] >> NO.
[ct=401.913] RATTLER THROWS, THEY MAKE THE
[ct=403.275] CATCH.
[ct=407.188] WHAT A START FOR THE ROOKIE WHO
[ct=409.853] MADE HIS FIRST START LAST WEEK.
[ct=413.864] >> HOW ABOUT THAT, THEY COME OUT
[ct=417.854] RIGHT AWAY AND FIND A TIGHT END,
[ct=420.499] NOBODY PICKS HIM UP.
[ct=424.480] MAN TO MAN TEAM BUT COMBINATION
[ct=428.483] OF MAN AND ZONE TONIGHT.
[ct=441.942] >> L YOU'VE GOT RATTLER, ONE OF
[ct=443.297] THE FRONT RUNNERS FOR THE
[ct=443.297] HEISMAN TROPHY.
[ct=449.891] TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HE DID DOWN
[ct=449.891] 17-0.
[ct=453.926] HE LED THEM IN THE SECOND
[ct=457.918] QUARTER AND HERE IS DEREK CARR
[ct=460.506] BLOWN OUT BY TAMPA BAY.
[ct=464.607] SECOND AND NINE.
[ct=471.196] OUT OF THE POCKET, HE'S LUCKY
[ct=472.569] THAT WAS NOT PICKED OFF.
[ct=476.534] BARTON COULD NOT SECURE IT.
[ct=480.562] FORCING RATTLER OUT OF THE
[ct=480.562] POCKET.
[ct=488.463] >> THIS IS A MAN TO MAN TEAM BUT
[ct=489.799] THEY WILL PLAY ZONE AND MAKE THE
[ct=492.545] QUARTERBACK MAKE DECISIONS.
[ct=496.536] SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO DIAL UP
[ct=496.536] THE PRESSURE.
[ct=501.866] HE CAUGHT A BREAK THAT TIME
[ct=503.136] THROUGH THE HANDS.
[ct=511.205] >> THIRD AND NINE IN THE POCKET,
[ct=516.531] FIRES, TAKEN IN AT THE 40 SEVEN
[ct=520.510] YARD LINE BY CEDRIC WILSON,
[ct=524.515] TACKLED BY MCMILLAN FOR A FOURTH
[ct=524.515] DOWN.
[ct=529.797] >> IT'S GOING TO BE THAT KIND OF
[ct=529.797] THE GAME.
[ct=535.093] ESPECIALLY WITH RATTLER,
[ct=536.482] LAST WEEK.
[ct=541.923] >> MIGHT BE THAT TYPE OF GAME,
[ct=543.151] TURNS OUT TO BE SOMETHING ELSE.
[ct=552.491] A ROOKIE KICKER BANK THAT ONE
[ct=556.463] INSIDE THE END ZONE.
[ct=560.458] BO NIX COMES BACK OUT.
[ct=564.705] LOOK AT HIS TIMELINE.
[ct=574.019] HE GOES WEST, WINS PLAYER OF THE
[ct=579.340] YEAR, 12TH OVERALL PICK.
[ct=585.975] NO QUARTERBACKS IN 130 EIGHT
[ct=588.659] PICKS UNTIL THEY GOT TO RATTLER.
[ct=593.969] >>. STORY WITH BO NIX, HIS DAD
[ct=595.386] PLAYED QUARTERBACK.
[ct=601.912] AFTER THREE YEARS HE LEFT AND
[ct=603.246] TURNED HIS CAREER AROUND.
[ct=611.207] >> A GAIN OF 74 MARVIN MIMS JR.
[ct=611.207] OUT OF OKLAHOMA.
[ct=617.855] >> THE WORLD WE LIVE IN, THESE
[ct=623.175] COACHES AND GM'S FIND IT
[ct=627.179] REFRESHING WHEN A GUY GETS
[ct=628.468] THROUGH STUFF AND THEN SURVIVES
[ct=631.163] AND HAS BEEN THROUGH TOUGH
[ct=631.163] TIMES.
[ct=633.753] I THINK THAT IS VERY ATTRACTIVE.
[ct=636.599] IT WAS TO SEAN PAYTON.
[ct=641.855] >> SECOND DOWN AND THREE AND
[ct=647.206] THEY HAND THE BALL OFF, JUST
[ct=649.766] LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO PICK UP
[ct=652.471] GOOD YARDAGE.
[ct=656.474] >>3
[ct=659.119] KIRK: I WATCHED HIM PLAY AT
[ct=659.119] NOTRE DAME.
[ct=661.746] HE IS A POWERFUL BACK.
[ct=665.751] JAVONTE WILLIAMS STILL WORKING
[ct=668.389] HIS WAY BACK FROM THE KNEE A
[ct=669.712] COUPLE YEARS AGO, THEY ARE
[ct=671.088] HOPING ESTIME CAN BE THAT
[ct=675.049] THUMPER IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=677.680] AL: THEY WILL BRING IN JALEEL
[ct=677.680] MCLAUGHLIN.
[ct=681.644] SLANTS, COT AND INTO SAINTS
[ct=685.759] TERRITORY GOES VELE, THE ROOKIE
[ct=685.759] OUT OF UTAH.
[ct=691.114] HE LOOKS GOOD, 6'5 H
[ct=692.365] HANDS".
[ct=693.692] KIRK:, A GREAT CATCH RADIUS.
[ct=700.369] WHEN BO NIX'S FEET ARE SET, LOOK
[ct=701.633] HOW GREAT OF A THROWER HE IS.
[ct=704.366] THAT IS WHY THE COACHES ARE SO
[ct=707.014] EXCITED ABOUT HIS POTENTIAL OF
[ct=708.334] WHAT HE CAN BECOME.
[ct=711.051] WORKING THROUGH HIS PROGRESSIONS
[ct=712.385] AND KEEPING THE RHYTHM.
[ct=716.361] WILLIAMS BACK IN AS A RUNNING
[ct=716.361] BACK.
[ct=717.653] PLAY-ACTION.
[ct=721.661] THE PASS WILL BE CAUGHT AT THE
[ct=721.661] 50 YARD LINE.
[ct=728.364] FRANKLIN PICKS UP A COUPLE OF
[ct=728.364] YARDS ON THE PLAY.
[ct=730.972] IT WILL BE SECOND AND 8.
[ct=734.974] KIRK: I AM SURE DENVER LOOKING
[ct=734.974] AT CELL SCOUTING, THEY HAVE
[ct=738.939] ATTACKED THROUGH THE AIR TO THE
[ct=740.268] LEFT BECAUSE COURTLAND SUTTON
[ct=740.268] LINES UP TO THE LEFT.
[ct=744.250] WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR TARGETS
[ct=749.553] ON A PASSING DIAGRAM, THEY HAVE
[ct=750.905] BEEN THROWING A LOT OF BALLS
[ct=752.218] THE MIDDLE AND OFF TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=754.883] SUTTON WILL EVENTUALLY GET
[ct=756.245] INVOLVED.
[ct=758.863] AL: THEY PUT BURTON IN AT
[ct=758.863] FULLBACK.
[ct=762.872] WILLIAMS BREAKING TACKLES AND HE
[ct=765.497] PICKS UP A FIRST DOWN, GETTING
[ct=766.870] TO THE 35 YARD LINE.
[ct=772.157] KIRK: THEY GO WITH THE BIG
[ct=774.807] FULLBACK, BURTON, NICE JOB
[ct=776.129] LEADING THE WAY WITH THE
[ct=777.463] ISOLATION BLOCK.
[ct=778.823] IT IS GOOD TO SEE JAVONTE
[ct=781.443] WILLIAMS RUN HARD LIKE THAT.
[ct=784.097] AL: THEY GO NO-HUDDLE AND PICK
[ct=784.097] UP THE PACE.
[ct=785.453] GREAT PROTECTION.
[ct=789.395] CAUGHT AT THE 30 YARD LINE,
[ct=792.052] TAKEN DOWN IS JAVONTE WILLIAMS
[ct=792.052] AND THAT WILL MA
[ct=793.458] DOWN AND ABOUT 5.
[ct=797.446] KIRK: ONE GUY YOU DO NOT HAVE TO
[ct=798.843] WORRY ABOUT TACKLING IS DEMARIO
[ct=798.843] DAVIS.
[ct=801.460] THE REST OF THE DEFENSE MISSED
[ct=805.451] 18 TACKLES AGAINST TAMPA BAY, 33
[ct=806.768] OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS.
[ct=812.036] JUST A CHECK DOWN AND THEY GET
[ct=812.036] POSITIVE YARDS ON FIRST AND 10.
[ct=814.746] WHEN YOU HAVE A ROOKIE
[ct=816.026] QUARTERBACK, STAY ON SCHEDULE.
[ct=820.041] AL: SECOND AND 4.
[ct=824.005] THE BACK IS MCLAUGHLIN.
[ct=825.369] SMOTHERED.
[ct=830.623] ANFERNEE ORJI COMES IN TO BREAK
[ct=831.961] UP THAT PLAY.
[ct=833.319] IT WILL BE THIRD AND 6.
[ct=838.754] KIRK: FIVE DEFENSIVE LINEMEN IN,
[ct=841.268] SO IT IS HARD TO WORK THE
[ct=842.597] DOUBLE-TEAMS AND GET UP TO THE
[ct=842.597] LINEBACKER.
[ct=846.586] LOOK AT THE DOUBLE-TEAMS, THEY
[ct=846.586] CANNOT QUITE GET UP THERE.
[ct=850.554] IT WAS A GOOD EFFORT BUT IT
[ct=851.894] KEEPS THE LINEBACKER FREE AND HE
[ct=853.265] IS ABLE TO GET DOWNHILL IN A
[ct=853.265] HURRY.
[ct=855.882] AL: THIRD AND 6.
[ct=861.220] SPREAD IT OUT.
[ct=863.865] FIVE WIDE.
[ct=866.503] NIX LOOKS THAT WAY.
[ct=867.857] THROWS.
[ct=869.196] HE STILL HAS IT.
[ct=874.449] NIX ON THE MOVE, BREAKING AWAY
[ct=877.215] THAT TIME FROM CHASE YOUNG, AND
[ct=879.802] OUT OF BOUNDS INSIDE THE 30 YARD
[ct=879.802] LINE.
[ct=882.447] FOURTH AND 3.
[ct=885.268] KIRK: NOT ONLY IS HE FAST, HE IS
[ct=886.605] POWERFUL.
[ct=887.983] GREAT JOB KEEPING THE PLAY
[ct=890.593] ALIVE.
[ct=893.315] ALMOST HAD ENOUGH SPEED TO TURN
[ct=893.315] THE CORNER FOR THE FIRST D
[ct=894.527] BUT AT LEAST HE KEEPS THEM IN
[ct=895.867] FIELD GOAL RANGE.
[ct=898.559] AL: A 46-YARD ATTEMPT FOR WIL
[ct=901.284] LUTZ, WHO WAS PICKED UP LAST
[ct=901.284] YEAR.
[ct=905.274] HE WAS WITH SEAN PAYTON HERE FOR
[ct=906.566] SEVEN YEARS IN NEW ORLEANS.
[ct=909.264] QUARTERBACK, PAYTON AND HIS
[ct=911.883] FIRST YEAR AS HEAD COACH, FACING
[ct=915.897] THE DALLAS COWBOYS, COACHED BY
[ct=919.915] BILL PARCELLS, ONE OF SEAN'S ME
[ct=921.213] NTORS.
[ct=923.868] KIRK: THAT WAS A SPECIAL YEAR IN
[ct=925.192] SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS.
[ct=926.518] AL: ABSOLUTELY.
[ct=929.222] POST-KATRINA.
[ct=934.451] DECIMATED BY KATRINA IN 2005.
[ct=938.435] NOW YOU HAVE PAYTON AND NIX.
[ct=941.174] TOUGH LOVE ALL YEAR LONG.
[ct=943.779] JERMAINE JACKSON FROM THE GOAL
[ct=947.783] UP TO THE 33.
[ct=950.566] THIS TOWN WAS A WRECK.
[ct=953.263] THE SAINTS HAD TO PLAY ALL OF
[ct=954.523] THEIR GAME ON THE ROAD.
[ct=958.529] SAN ANTONIO, BATON ROUGE,
[ct=958.529] SHREVEPORT.
[ct=962.566] THEY COME BACK IN AND PAYTON
[ct=963.849] TAKES THE JOB AND THEY GET
[ct=965.186] AND THAT TURNED EVERYTHING
[ct=965.186] AROUND.
[ct=969.183] KIRK: INCREDIBLE IN HIS FIRST
[ct=970.487] YEAR TO HAVE THAT MOMENT IN THAT
[ct=973.258] BUILDING AFTER EVERYTHING THIS
[ct=974.554] REGION HAD BEEN THROUGH WAS
[ct=975.915] ALMOST LIKE A REBIRTH FOR SO
[ct=977.219] MANY PEOPLE.
[ct=978.532] THEY RALLIED AROUND THIS
[ct=979.864] FOOTBALL TEAM.
[ct=982.549] HE AND DREW BREES ARE SYMBOLIC
[ct=983.857] HAD.
[ct=986.491] AL: THERAPEUTIC FOR THE FANS.
[ct=990.472] ALVIN KAMARA WILL BE TAKEN OUT
[ct=991.836] AFTER A SHORT GAIN.
[ct=995.793] KIRK: HE HAS DOWNPLAYED IT ALL
[ct=995.793] WEEK AND RIGHTFULLY SO.
[ct=999.812] WHEN YOU GET INTO A TEAM SPORT
[ct=999.812] IT IS FOCUSED ON EXECUTION.
[ct=1002.448] BUSINESS TRIP AND WINNING A
[ct=1003.777] FOOTBALL GAME.
[ct=1006.433] AFTER ALL HE WENT THROUGH, IT IS
[ct=1007.764] NOT JUST ABOUT FOOTBALL.
[ct=1010.459] I THINK THERE IS A LOT TO DO
[ct=1010.459] WITH WHAT HE MEANT TO THE CITY.
[ct=1014.386] AL: TALKING ABOUT SHOWING UP
[ct=1014.386] FIVE HOURS EARLY.
[ct=1017.178] HE WENT TO A LUNCHEON HONORING
[ct=1018.495] DREW BREES TODAY AT NOON.
[ct=1022.452] BREAKING A TACKLE, STILL ON HIS
[ct=1025.132] FEET, UP TO THE 40 YARD LINE
[ct=1029.103] GOES KENDRE MILLER, WHO THE
[ct=1030.442] ACTIVATED.
[ct=1031.746] IT WILL BE THIRD AND 2.
[ct=1038.383] SEAN, HE LEAVES HERE, HE WAS
[ct=1041.069] STILL UNDER CONTRACT, AND THEY
[ct=1042.353] HAD TO MAKE A TRADE TO GET HIM
[ct=1042.353] TO DENVER.
[ct=1050.326] SEAN SPENT A YEAR AT FOX SPORTS,
[ct=1050.326] CHARISSA THOMPSON ON HER SHOW.
[ct=1055.665] HE MISSED LOOKING AT THE
[ct=1055.665] SCOREBOARD.
[ct=1059.673] THE CATCH IS MADE BY BUB MEANS,
[ct=1060.965] A ROOKIE OUT OF PITTSBURGH.
[ct=1063.760] DRAFTED HIM IN THE FIFTH ROUND.
[ct=1067.690] KIRK: IMAGINE KLINT KUBIAK
[ct=1067.690] TRYING TO PUT THIS GAME PLAN
[ct=1069.014] TOGETHER.
[ct=1071.656] YOU TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING THEY
[ct=1073.000] ARE MISSING, PLAYING A ROOKIE
[ct=1075.657] QUARTERBACK, SHAHEED DOWN, OLAVE
[ct=1080.956] DOWN, THIRD AND SHORT, A BUNCHED
[ct=1083.659] FORMATION AND DENVER DOES NOT
[ct=1086.260] PICK UP BUB MEANS, HE WAS ABLE
[ct=1086.260] TO CLEAR
[ct=1087.749] EASY FOR RATTLER.
[ct=1090.386] AL: LOOK OUT!
[ct=1092.972] HE GETS HIT WITH THE ARM COMING
[ct=1092.972] FORWARD.
[ct=1095.659] HAVE NOT HEARD A WHISTLE.
[ct=1098.306] MEANWHILE, CODY BARTON COMING
[ct=1098.306] IN.
[ct=1102.285] THEY WILL RULE THAT A FUMBLE AND
[ct=1102.285] A RECOVERY.
[ct=1106.260] KWON ALEXANDER, THEY JUST
[ct=1110.243] ACTIVATED HIM, IN HIS 10TH EAR
[ct=1111.736] IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=1112.992] THEY WILL CONTEND IT IS A
[ct=1114.374] FUMBLE.
[ct=1116.962] WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AND SEE WHAT
[ct=1118.292] REPLAY SHOWS US.
[ct=1120.947] KIRK: WATCH HOW BARTON DISGUISES
[ct=1120.947] THIS.
[ct=1123.799] THIS IS WHAT TAMPA DID LAST
[ct=1123.799] WEEK.
[ct=1125.105] NOBODY PICKED HIM UP.
[ct=1131.756] THE 23RD SACK ON THE YEAR, THEY
[ct=1131.756] ARE SECOND IN THE NFL.
[ct=1134.386] TERRY MCCAULEY VERIFIES THAT IS
[ct=1135.861] A FUMBLE.
[ct=1143.772] AL: BARTON IS IN HIS FIRST YEAR
[ct=1143.772] IN DENVER.
[ct=1147.906] ALEXANDER ON THE RIGHT HAS
[ct=1149.190] PLAYED FOR SIX TEAMS NOW.
[ct=1150.520] RATTLER WITH THE FUMBLE.
[ct=1153.205] BARTON ALMOST HAD A PICK
[ct=1153.205] EARLIER.
[ct=1154.462] KIRK: HE DID.
[ct=1159.832] AL: HE CREATES THE FUMBLE HERE
[ct=1159.832] AND DENVER TAKES OVER AT
[ct=1163.776] MIDFIELD, AT THEIR 45 YARD LINE.
[ct=1166.444] KIRK: HOW DO YOU WIN THE GAME IF
[ct=1167.789] YOU ARE DENVER?
[ct=1170.441] A ROOKIE QUARTERBACK WHO HAS
[ct=1173.051] BEEN GOOD AT TIMES AND AT TIMES
[ct=1174.413] HAS BEEN A ROOKIE, YOU LEAN ON
[ct=1174.413] YOUR DEFENSE.
[ct=1177.126] SEE IF THEY CAN CAPITALIZE ON
[ct=1178.367] THIS OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=1183.746] AL: HANGS IN THE POCKET, THROWS.
[ct=1186.343] CAUGHT AT THE 49 YA
[ct=1187.713] LUCAS KRULL.
[ct=1190.336] KIRK: WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE
[ct=1191.670] TACKLING OR LACK THEREOF FOR NEW
[ct=1191.670] ORLEANS.
[ct=1194.365] LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR NEXGEN
[ct=1194.365] STATS.
[ct=1198.350] 370 YARDS ALLOWED AFTER MISSED
[ct=1198.350] TACKLES.
[ct=1202.304] BY FAR THE MOST IN THE NFL.
[ct=1204.962] WE HAVE SEEN SOME MOMENTS
[ct=1206.289] TONIGHT WHERE JAVONTE WILLIAMS
[ct=1208.939] GOT TO THE SECOND LEVEL,
[ct=1208.939] BOUNCING OFF OF WOULD BE
[ct=1210.291] TACKLERS.
[ct=1211.603] THERE HAS BEEN A HUGE EMPHASIS.
[ct=1216.978] IN A SHORT WEEK, IT IS TOUGH.
[ct=1216.978] THEY SHO
[ct=1218.309] TRY TO MOTIVATE THEM.
[ct=1222.444] AL: THAT IS 60 YARDS PER GAME
[ct=1222.444] WORTH OF MISSED TACKLES.
[ct=1226.490] THAT TIME THEY STOP HIM CLOSE TO
[ct=1226.490] A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1230.476] WE GO TO KAYLEE.
[ct=1234.462] KAYLEE: THE SAINTS HAVE OWNED
[ct=1235.798] THE TACKLING IS A PROBLEM.
[ct=1239.792] DEMARIO DAVIS TOLD ME THERE ARE
[ct=1241.161] NO MOTIVATIONAL TACTICS NEEDED
[ct=1241.161] AT THIS POINT.
[ct=1243.790] EVERYONE HAS A SENSE OF URGENCY.
[ct=1247.792] HE BELIEVES SOLVING THE PROBLEM
[ct=1247.792] IS MORE MENTAL THAN ANYTHING.
[ct=1251.750] THEY CAN EXECUTE BUT IT COMES
[ct=1253.071] DOWN TO HAVING A HIGH LEVEL OF
[ct=1254.415] FOCUS AND BEING PHYSICAL.
[ct=1257.087] AL: DAVIS HAS BEEN CONSISTENT IN
[ct=1258.408] HIS CAREER.
[ct=1259.728] 200TH GAME FOR HIM.
[ct=1263.693] THIRD DOWN AND INCHES AND A
[ct=1265.090] QUARTERBACK SNEAK AS NIX KEEPS
[ct=1267.701] IT AND TAKES IT TO THE 44-YARD
[ct=1269.053] LINE WITH A LITTLE OVER 2
[ct=1270.373] MINUTES TO PLAY I
[ct=1271.702] QUARTER.
[ct=1273.059] DENVER ON TOP, 3-0.
[ct=1275.660] KIRK: YOU HAVE BEEN TACKLING
[ct=1275.660] YOUR WHOLE LIFE.
[ct=1279.655] IT IS ABOUT COMMUNICATI
[ct=1280.944] IT IS LIKE REBOUNDING IN
[ct=1280.944] BASKETBALL.
[ct=1284.928] WHEN YOU SEE IT CONSISTENTLY
[ct=1286.263] BECOMING AN ISSUE -- DENNIS
[ct=1287.630] ALLEN TALKED ABOUT ANGLES,
[ct=1288.977] LEVERAGE AN TECHNIQUE.
[ct=1290.261] A LOT OF TIMES THEY ARE
[ct=1291.697] AND THEY HIT BUT THEY DO NOT
[ct=1291.697] WRAP UP.
[ct=1295.672] I THINK WE HAVE BEEN PRETTY
[ct=1295.672] CLEAR.
[ct=1296.957] IT HAS BEEN EMPHASIZED.
[ct=1299.664] SEE HOW THEY RESPOND TONIGHT.
[ct=1303.655] AL: WILLIAMS AND MCLAUGHLIN BOTH
[ct=1303.655] IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=1309.095] 37 YARD LINE, JAVONTE WILLIAMS.
[ct=1312.966] KIRK: MIKE MCGLINCHEY BACK IN
[ct=1312.966] THE LINEUP.
[ct=1314.251] HE HAS BEEN OUT THE LAST FOUR
[ct=1319.565] WEEKS AND HE IS NOW BACK AT THE
[ct=1319.565] RIGHT TACKLE SPOT.
[ct=1323.576] IF YOU ARE A DENVER FAN YOU ARE
[ct=1326.189] WATCHING THIS THINKING, "THAT IS
[ct=1326.189] MORE LIKE IT."
[ct=1330.189] THEY HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO RUN
[ct=1331.556] THE FOOTBALL AND TAKE PRESSURE
[ct=1331.556] OFF BO NIX.
[ct=1334.153] THERE THEY GET POSITIVE YARDS
[ct=1335.496] AND GETTING JAVONTE WIL
[ct=1336.897] RUNNING DOWNHILL.
[ct=1339.551] AL: THEY HAVE ALREADY RUN IT
[ct=1342.185] NINE TIMES FOR 52 YARDS ON THE
[ct=1342.185] GROUND.
[ct=1343.705] SECOND DOWN AND 3.
[ct=1347.444] CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN IS
[ct=1347.444] WILLIAMS.
[ct=1350.140] TAKE A LOOK AT THE STICKS.
[ct=1355.546] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1360.740] KIRK: SEAN PAYTON, I LOVED HOW
[ct=1362.069] HE SAID I DO NOT HAVE THAT
[ct=1362.069] JOKER.
[ct=1364.708] WHEN I WAS IN NEW ORLEANS WE HAD
[ct=1367.358] A JOKER, REGGIE BUSH OR DARREN
[ct=1370.052] SPROLES IN THE BACKFIELD, JEREMY
[ct=1371.331] SHOCKEY, JIMMY GRAHAM.
[ct=1375.355] THAT MEANS A GUY WHO CAN WIN IN
[ct=1376.649] THE PASS GAME, ONE-ON-ONE
[ct=1378.011] AGAINST LINEBACKERS.
[ct=1380.648] HE HAS HAD TO DO IT IN DIFFERENT
[ct=1382.145] WAYS, MIXING UP PERSONNEL
[ct=1382.145] GROUPINGS.
[ct=1387.362] AL: PASS TO THE OUTSIDE,
[ct=1387.362] INCOMPLETE.
[ct=1388.682] FLAG IS THROWN.
[ct=1395.336] WE WILL HEAR FROM A REFEREE, MR.
[ct=1396.667] LAND CLARK, FOR THE FIRST TIME
[ct=1400.661] REFEREE: PRIOR TO THE PASS,
[ct=1404.647] HOLDING, DEFENSE, NUMBER 29.
[ct=1407.266] FIVE YARD PENALTY, AUTOM
[ct=1415.222] AL: ADEBO, HE HAS PROBABLY DRAWN
[ct=1416.609] MORE FLAGS THAN ANY
[ct=1417.975] BACK IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=1420.580] KIRK: WITH MARSHON LATTIMORE ON
[ct=1423.233] THE OTHER SIDE IT IS NOT A SHOCK
[ct=1423.233] THAT PEOPLE GO AT HIM.
[ct=1427.192] WHAT GETS OVERLOOKED BECAUSE HE
[ct=1429.890] HAS THREE INTERCEPTIONS AND
[ct=1431.201] PEOPLE THINK HE IS HAVING A BIG
[ct=1431.201] YEAR BUT A LOT OF PASS
[ct=1433.830] INTERFERENCES AND DEFENSE OF
[ct=1433.830] HOLDINGS.
[ct=1440.505] AL: NIX KEEPS IT, THROWS, CAUGHT
[ct=1440.505] OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=1443.245] TROY FRANKLIN SIGNALS A FIRST
[ct=1447.194] WE WILL TAKE A BREAK AT THE END
[ct=1448.566] OF THE FIRST QUARTER.
[ct=1449.849] WILL GO INTO THE
[ct=1451.172] SAINTS HALL OF FAME AT THE HALF
[ct=1452.575] AND WE WILL GET HIM UP IN THE
[ct=1453.891] BOOTH SOMETIME IN THE THIRD
[ct=1459.289] SO, SECOND QUARTER STARTS.
[ct=1463.233] WITH A FIRST DOWN AT THE 17-YARD
[ct=1465.898] LINE WITH THE DENVER BRONCOS UP,
[ct=1467.208] 3-0.
[ct=1471.341] TOSS IT HERE, WILLIAMS.
[ct=1472.556] A BIT OF A CREASE.
[ct=1477.905] THEY HAVE TAKEN OVER THE TIME OF
[ct=1477.905] POSSESSION.
[ct=1480.493] THEY HAVE HAD THE BALL FOR
[ct=1484.485] 11:30, TO A LITTLE LESS THAN 4
[ct=1485.789] FOR THE SAINTS.
[ct=1489.770] KIRK: THE CHARGERS KEPT
[ct=1493.756] CONVERTING THIRD DOWNS AND HAVE
[ct=1493.756] THE BALL FOR 37 MINUTES.
[ct=1497.736] THE BIGGEST CHANGE I SEE IS THEY
[ct=1499.100] ARE WINNING THE LINE OF
[ct=1499.100] SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=1501.916] THEY ARE RUNNING THE FOOTBALL
[ct=1504.428] WHICH IS FOOTING BO NIX IN A
[ct=1504.428] FAVORABLE POSIT
[ct=1505.777] CHECK DOWN PASSES.
[ct=1507.066] AL: HANGS IN THE POCKET.
[ct=1515.042] PUTS HIS SHOULDER DOWN AND IS
[ct=1516.361] ABOUT TO YARDS SHY OF THE FIRST
[ct=1519.012] TACKLED BY LATTIMORE.
[ct=1520.354] THIRD DOWN AND 2.
[ct=1523.007] KIRK: HE HAS BEEN THROWING THESE
[ct=1523.007] CHECK DOWNS.
[ct=1528.324] THIS TIME HE IS LOOKING TO HIS
[ct=1530.941] LEFT, 14, COURTLAND SUTTON,
[ct=1532.303] WORKING ACROSS AGAIN ZONE, HE
[ct=1534.961] ALMOST THREW IT BUT HE
[ct=1536.272] DID THE RIGHT THING BY HOLDING
[ct=1536.272] ONTO IT.
[ct=1540.278] HE ALWAYS TRUSTS HIS ATHLETIC
[ct=1540.278] ABILITY.
[ct=1542.962] SETS UP A THIRD AND SHORT.
[ct=1548.304] AL: HE HAD 61 RUSHING YARDS LAST
[ct=1549.618] SUNDAY, HE ALREADY HAS 31
[ct=1550.893] TONIGHT ON FIVE CARRIES.
[ct=1552.178] THIRD AND 1.
[ct=1553.540] OFF THE FAKE.
[ct=1556.187] A TON OF TIME.
[ct=1558.879] ALL DAY, ALL NIGHT.
[ct=1560.154] ROLLING.
[ct=1562.852] THE COVERAGE IS VERY GOOD AND
[ct=1564.140] THE PASS IS SHORT.
[ct=1566.866] IT WAS TIPPED.
[ct=1569.488] IT WILL BE FOURTH DOWN AND 1.
[ct=1572.150] KIRK: HE DID THE HARD PART.
[ct=1576.143] THE COVERAGE WAS GOOD.
[ct=1576.143] THEY ARE SITTING BACK.
[ct=1580.145] THIS TIME THEY BRACKET 84,
[ct=1580.145] HUMPHREY.
[ct=1585.615] VELE IS TRYING TO WORK OUT ON A
[ct=1585.615] DELAYED REACTION.
[ct=1588.280] THEY DID EVERYTHING RIGHT AND
[ct=1589.563] RECEIVER.
[ct=1592.216] AL: GOING FOR IT ON FOURTH AND
[ct=1592.216] 1.
[ct=1598.890] TRYING TO DRAW THEM OFFSIDE.
[ct=1605.513] WELL, YOU CAN LOOK AT IT THIS
[ct=1609.498] WAY -- IT WILL BE A VERY LOW-
[ct=1609.498] SCORING GAME.
[ct=1613.456] YOU THINK MAYBE THEY WILL GO
[ct=1613.456] FORWARD ON FOURTH AND 1.
[ct=1616.122] THEY TAKE A TIMEOUT HERE.
[ct=1618.786] KIRK: I AM WITH YOU.
[ct=1622.788] POINTS TONIGHT, IF YOU GET THE
[ct=1622.788] CHANCE TO GET INTO FIELD GOAL
[ct=1626.823] RANGE, WITH THE WAY DENVER'S
[ct=1628.055] DEFENSE WILL PLAY TONIGHT
[ct=1629.402] AGAINST RATTLER, YOU TAKE THE
[ct=1630.787] THREE POINTS.
[ct=1634.716] AL: THAT DOES NOT GO OVER
[ct=1636.052] FOR THE OVER, BY THE WAY.
[ct=1637.353] KIRK: [LAUGHTER]
[ct=1640.159] WE KNEW THAT COMING IN.
[ct=1641.384] AL: WIL LUTZ.
[ct=1643.986] NO LOVE LOST.
[ct=1649.346] 32-YARD ATTEMPT.
[ct=1653.314] WRITE DOWN CANAL STREET.
[ct=1658.682] THAT WILL MAKE IT DENVER 6, AND
[ct=1661.313] NEW ORLEANS DRAFT WITH SIX QUART
[ct=1663.958] GOING IN THE FIRST ROUND AND
[ct=1665.295] THEN NONE UNTIL THE FIFTH ROUND,
[ct=1666.563] WHERE HE WAS PICK NUMBER 150.
[ct=1670.545] KIRK: THE PICTURE WITH HIM WITH
[ct=1673.258] HIS LEFT THUMB POINTING TO THE
[ct=1675.871] NAMEPLATE ON THE BACK, HE IS
[ct=1678.525] POINTING TO HIS SHOULDER, THE
[ct=1679.872] CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER ENTERING
[ct=1679.872] THE NFL.
[ct=1683.849] NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE DRAFT
[ct=1685.201] BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM IN
[ct=1686.515] OKLAHOMA, WHEN CALEB WILLIAMS
[ct=1688.013] TOOK OVER.
[ct=1689.351] AL: JACKSON TAKES IT A COUPLE OF
[ct=1691.978] YARDS DEEP IN THE END Z
[ct=1693.430] TAKES IT BACK TO THE 30.
[ct=1696.053] KIRK: NOT SHORT ON CONFIDENCE.
[ct=1697.348] AL: NO.
[ct=1700.217] KIRK: HE IS A GUY THAT DESPITE
[ct=1700.217] WHAT HE HAS BEEN THROUGH
[ct=1704.153] BELIEVES HE IS DESTINED TO BE
[ct=1705.520] STARTER, A FRANCHISE
[ct=1705.520] QUARTERBACK.
[ct=1708.132] HE IS GETTING
[ct=1709.470] WITH DEREK CARR DOWN FOR A FEW
[ct=1709.470] GAMES.
[ct=1712.165] HE HAS THE PHYSICAL ABILITY.
[ct=1714.790] NOT THE TALLEST GUY BUT HE GETS
[ct=1717.582] ON THE EDGE, HE IS ATHLETIC AND
[ct=1717.582] HAS A BIG ARM.
[ct=1721.479] HE NEEDS REPS, HE NEEDS TO
[ct=1722.783] LEARN.
[ct=1725.462] AL: HIGH SNAP.
[ct=1726.772] DROPS IT.
[ct=1730.769] IN TROUBLE, RUNS INTO HIS OWN
[ct=1733.399] MAN AND THEN LOSES THE BALL.
[ct=1734.717] IT IS PICKED UP BY CODY BARTON.
[ct=1736.117] TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=1744.063] CODY BARTON HAS TAKEN IT INTO
[ct=1744.063] THE END ZONE.
[ct=1746.759] MEANWHILE, A L
[ct=1748.036] GOING ON WITH THE OFFICIALS.
[ct=1752.031] KIRK: I THINK DENVER'S D.J.
[ct=1752.031] JONES WAS OFFSIDE.
[ct=1754.743] IT WILL NEGATE THIS PLAY FOR
[ct=1754.743] DENVER.
[ct=1761.377] REFEREE: OFFSIDES, DEFENSE,
[ct=1761.377] NUMBER 93.
[ct=1763.984] FIVE YARD PENALTY, STILL FIRST
[ct=1767.991] AL: RIGHT OVER THE CENTER,
[ct=1767.991] CONNOR MCGOVERN.
[ct=1771.971] A HUGE BREAK FOR THE ROOKIE.
[ct=1777.288] INSTEAD OF A TOUCHDOWN --
[ct=1779.945] MEANWHILE, BARTON IS ALL OVER
[ct=1779.945] THE PLACE TONIGHT.
[ct=1783.996] THE BALL IS OUT TO THE 35-YARD
[ct=1785.251] LINE AND A FIRST AND 5.
[ct=1789.291] KIRK: HIS OUTSTANDING CENTER IS
[ct=1789.291] OUT.
[ct=1790.563] THE BACKUP IS OUT.
[ct=1794.668] YOU HAVE A GUY, CONNOR MCGOVERN,
[ct=1795.899] WHO THEY SIGNED 13 DAYS AGO.
[ct=1800.052] AL: AGAIN, THIS TIME THEY
[ct=1801.359] WHISTLE IT DEAD.
[ct=1805.373] THAT IS BROWNING OFFSIDE.
[ct=1811.985] REFEREE: NEUTRAL ZONE
[ct=1813.358] INFRACTION, DEFENSE, NUMBER 5.
[ct=1822.586] KAYLEE: ACCORDING TO TIGHT
[ct=1823.958] FOSTER MOREAU, SPENCER RATTLER
[ct=1826.585] THROWS A FASTER BALL AND FROM A
[ct=1827.958] DIFFERENT ARM ANGLE THAN DEREK
[ct=1827.958] CARR.
[ct=1829.277] HE DESCRIBED IT AS A BASEBALL
[ct=1830.743] THROW.
[ct=1833.411] SOME OF THE SAINTS RECEIVER
[ct=1834.572] A HARD TIME ADJUSTING TO THE
[ct=1835.904] DEFENSE.
[ct=1838.554] THIS TIME THEY TURNED UP THE
[ct=1841.219] SPEED ON THE JUGS MACHI
[ct=1842.567] BETTER ADJUSTED TO RATTLER.
[ct=1845.190] AL: WHATEVER IT TAKES.
[ct=1850.484] COMPLEMENT OF RECEIVERS.
[ct=1854.461] RATTLER, DEEP DOWN FIELD, THE
[ct=1857.183] RECEIVER FALLS DOWN, MASON
[ct=1857.183] TIPTON.
[ct=1861.194] THE CROWD WANTS A FLAG, THERE IS
[ct=1861.194] NONE.
[ct=1863.775] RILEY MOSS WITH THE COVERAGE.
[ct=1865.155] IT WILL BE SECOND AND 10.
[ct=1867.907] KIRK: IT LOOKED LIKE HE LOST HIS
[ct=1867.907] BALANCE.
[ct=1871.851] DENNIS ALLEN THINKS HE WAS
[ct=1871.851] PUSHED BY THE CORNER MAAS.
[ct=1877.171] -- THE CORNER MOSS.
[ct=1882.497] HE WANTS -- OK.
[ct=1887.749] 21 STEPS ON HIS FOOT.
[ct=1890.444] AL: SECOND DOWN AND 10.
[ct=1894.385] THAT PASS IS CAUGHT FOR A GAIN
[ct=1894.385] OF FOUR.
[ct=1899.712] JUWAN JOHNSON, A WIDE RECEIVER
[ct=1899.712] IN COLLEGE, NOW A TIGHT END.
[ct=1902.343] CODY BARTON MAKES THE TACKLE.
[ct=1905.065] KIRK: IF YOU DO NOT MIND
[ct=1906.353] CLARIFYING FOR PEOPLE, IF YOU
[ct=1908.993] HAVE FOOT ENTANGLEMENT AND THE
[ct=1908.993] DEFENDER IS NOT PLAYING THE
[ct=1910.446] BALL.
[ct=1914.433] TERRY: IT IS A FOUL FOR
[ct=1915.742] DEFENSIVE PASS INTERFERENCE.
[ct=1918.364] IF HE IS PLAYING THE BALL, IT IS
[ct=1918.364] NOT A FOUL.
[ct=1922.372] AL: OUR EXPERT HAS SPOKEN.
[ct=1926.346] AL: THIRD AND 5.
[ct=1930.337] RATTLER, PUMP FAKE, THROWS IT
[ct=1931.687] OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=1934.372] THEY PICKED UP A FIRST DOWN ON
[ct=1935.692] TWO PENALTIES.
[ct=1938.287] ON RATTLER.
[ct=1943.643] RATTLER STARTING 4-7 FOR 54
[ct=1944.930] YARDS AND ANOTHER PUNT.
[ct=1948.936] KIRK: ONE OF THE MORE UNDERRATED
[ct=1950.238] PLAYERS IS ZACH ALLEN.
[ct=1955.608] 6'5", 285.
[ct=1958.252] YOU CAN SEE HE HAS GOOD
[ct=1958.252] QUICKNESS.
[ct=1960.869] NOT THE MOST GIFTED GUY.
[ct=1963.583] HE SPENT SOME TIME WITH J.J.
[ct=1966.202] WATT AND PICKED UP SOME GREAT
[ct=1967.567] TECHNIQUE ON HOW TO BECOME A
[ct=1967.567] GREAT PASS RUSHER.
[ct=1978.169] AL: MATTHEW HAYBALL, FIELDED OF
[ct=1979.467] THE 13 YARD LINE AND MIMS GOES
[ct=1980.856] NOWHERE.
[ct=1983.472] THE COVERAGE IS REALLY GREAT
[ct=1990.103] AL: AS OF RIGHT NOW, THE DENVER
[ct=1992.731] BRONCOS HAVE HAD THE BALL ALMOST
[ct=1994.139] 13 MINUTES.
[ct=1995.429] LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES FOR THE
[ct=1996.748] SAINTS.
[ct=1999.394] THEY START THIS DRIVE FROM THEIR
[ct=2000.768] OWN 14-YARD LINE.
[ct=2004.706] 6-0.
[ct=2011.314] BRONCOS TRYING TO GET ABOVE .500
[ct=2015.347] , SAINTS TRYING TO SNAP A FOUR-
[ct=2016.653] GAME LOSING STREAK.
[ct=2019.337] ROLLING, LOO
[ct=2020.691] 18.
[ct=2024.692] KIRK: BO NIX, YOU SEE SOME OF
[ct=2024.692] THESE THROWS.
[ct=2028.638] HE IS HIS BIGGEST CRITIC.
[ct=2031.264] THIS IS AN AREA HE WILL GET MUCH
[ct=2031.264] BETTER.
[ct=2035.254] HIS MIND IS MOVING FAST AND HIS
[ct=2036.584] FEET ARE MOVING FAST AND HE IS
[ct=2037.972] MISSING OPEN TARGETS.
[ct=2039.237] LOOK HOW MUCH CLEANER IT IS.
[ct=2043.257] LOOK AT THE ACCURACY IN THAT
[ct=2043.257] THROW RIGHT THERE.
[ct=2045.906] THAT IS WHAT HE IS STRIVING
[ct=2049.847] THE CONSISTENCY OF THE FOOTWORK
[ct=2051.182] BEING BETTER, HIS EYES AND F
[ct=2052.549] ALIGNED.
[ct=2055.188] AL: SECOND AND 6.
[ct=2060.476] THROUGH THE MIDDLE, BIG HOLE,
[ct=2061.904] TACKLED FROM BEHIND AT THE 38
[ct=2063.148] YARD LINE GOES JAVONTE WILLIAMS.
[ct=2067.133] WE HAVE HAD FOUR DIFFERENT
[ct=2068.468] RUSHERS TONIGHT INCLUDING NIX.
[ct=2069.769] THAT WAS A GAIN OF 20.
[ct=2072.497] KIRK: THE TIGHT END COMES OVER
[ct=2073.735] AND HELPS PICK UP.
[ct=2075.089] LOOK AT THE CENTER GET TO THE
[ct=2079.066] THIS PLAY OPENS UP NICELY.
[ct=2081.726] WE HAVE NOT SEEN THIS FROM
[ct=2081.726] DENVER MUCH AT ALL THIS YEAR.
[ct=2084.448] TAKING A LOT OF THE HEAVY
[ct=2087.052] LIFTING OFF BO NIX ANDY'S
[ct=2089.753] RECEIVERS AND ALLOWING THEM TO
[ct=2092.385] EVENTUALLY GET SOME PLAY ACTION
[ct=2092.385] PASS GOING, CHECKING THE BALL
[ct=2095.092] DOWN INSTEAD OF HAVING TO FORCE
[ct=2095.092] THE BALL DOWNFIELD.
[ct=2099.020] 88 YARDS ALREADY ON THE GROUND.
[ct=2102.982] AL: THE ROOKIE ESTIME OUT OF
[ct=2105.637] NOTRE DAME TAKES THE HANDOFF AND
[ct=2105.637] FIGHTS HIS WAY PAST THE 40.
[ct=2106.982] SECOND AND 6.
[ct=2110.973] KIRK: IF YOU CAN START TO MIX IN
[ct=2114.991] ESTIME WITH WILLIAMS, WHO IS OFF
[ct=2117.604] TO A REALLY GOOD START, AND THEN
[ct=2118.968] THE CHANGE OF PACE BACK IS
[ct=2118.968] MCLOUGHLIN.
[ct=2122.958] IT IS A NICE TRIO THEY HAVE BACK
[ct=2122.958] THERE.
[ct=2128.236] REMEMBER, THEY ARE LOOKING FOR
[ct=2128.236] PLAYMAKERS.
[ct=2130.880] SOMEBODY BESIDE COURTLAND SUTTON
[ct=2134.877] AND JOSH REYNOLDS, WHO IS ON THE
[ct=2137.561] IR WITH SURGERY ON HIS FINGER.
[ct=2140.174] AL: SUTTON HAS NOT BEEN
[ct=2140.174] TARGETED.
[ct=2142.848] PLAY-ACTION, SCREEN.
[ct=2146.914] THERE GOES WILLIAMS, FIRST DOWN
[ct=2146.914] NEAR THE 50.
[ct=2153.450] POWERS THREW A NICE BLOCK.
[ct=2156.305] KIRK: SEAN PAYTON OFFEN
[ct=2157.658] WILL ALWAYS BE THINKING ABOUT
[ct=2157.658] THE SCREEN GAME.
[ct=2160.230] BEN POWERS, NICE JOB OF NOT
[ct=2164.283] SELLING IT TOO EARLY.
[ct=2166.890] JAVONTE WILLIAMS SHOWING THE
[ct=2169.542] JUMP CUT AT HIS SIZE, 220
[ct=2170.889] POUNDS, CUTTING BACK INSIDE.
[ct=2174.884] AL: YOU SAW ADEBO COME BACK IN,
[ct=2176.188] HE NEEDS A MOMENT.
[ct=2180.164] AL: LAST THING THE SAINTS NEED
[ct=2180.164] IS ANOTHER KEY INJURY.
[ct=2185.474] PAULSON ADEBO, STARTING CORNER
[ct=2186.849] ON THE OTHER SIDE OF LATTIMORE.
[ct=2188.134] THREE PICKS.
[ct=2193.436] HE HAS BEEN WITH THE TEAM SINCE
[ct=2193.436] 2021.
[ct=2198.787] ALWAYS THE WORST SITE IN T
[ct=2200.085] GAME WHEN YOU HAVE TO BRING THE
[ct=2201.481] CART OUT.
[ct=2206.780] THE SAINTS JUST DECIMATED ON
[ct=2208.043] BOTH SIDES OF THE BALL.
[ct=2214.726] KIRK: ADEBO, PAULSON ADEBO MAKES
[ct=2218.724] BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM ON THE
[ct=2220.070] CART.
[ct=2224.081] ANYTIME WE DO NOT WANT TO REPLAY
[ct=2225.441] SOMETHING FOR YOU, YOU KNOW IT
[ct=2225.441] IS SERIOUS.
[ct=2228.079] HOPE FOR THE BEST FOR PAULSON
[ct=2228.079] ADEBO.
[ct=2233.316] YOU HAVE KOOL-AID MCKINSTRY
[ct=2233.316] COMING INTO REPLACE HIM.
[ct=2237.289] IT IS FIRST AND 10 AS PLAY
[ct=2241.298] RESUMES FROM THE 50-YARD LINE
[ct=2241.298] FOR BO NIX.
[ct=2243.932] TO THE OUTSIDE HE GOES.
[ct=2247.977] THE OPEN MAN HE FINDS AND DOWN
[ct=2249.266] THE SIDELINE GOES FRANKLIN.
[ct=2251.902] KNOCKED OUT OF BOUNDS BY
[ct=2251.902] MCKINSTRY.
[ct=2253.278] THEY GO RIGHT TO
[ct=2254.532] JUST CAME IN THE GAME.
[ct=2258.582] KIRK: THIS IS A SLOW DEVELOPING
[ct=2258.582] LEVELS CONCEPT.
[ct=2262.533] THE TWO PLAY SIDE RECEIVERS ARE
[ct=2262.533] CLEARING OUT.
[ct=2266.491] THE BACKSIDE, FRANKLIN,
[ct=2267.886] EVENTUALLY COMES CLEAR AND THAT
[ct=2269.242] IS WHAT YOU ARE USED TO SEEING
[ct=2273.194] FROM BO NIX FROM HIS COLLEGE
[ct=2273.194] DAYS AT OREGON.
[ct=2277.174] NICE JOB OF ADJUSTING BY HIS
[ct=2278.442] COLLEGE TEAMMATE, FRANKLIN, FOR
[ct=2279.800] THE BIG GAIN.
[ct=2282.429] AL: BURTON, THE FULLBACK.
[ct=2285.118] WILLIAMS, THE RUNNING BACK.
[ct=2289.109] TO THE 18 YARD LINE.
[ct=2295.804] KAYLEE: YOU SAW THAT RATHER
[ct=2297.077] LARGE SPLINT PUT ON PAULSON
[ct=2298.394] ADEBO'S RIGHT LEG.
[ct=2301.046] IT IS CALLED A VACUUM SPLINT.
[ct=2303.710] TYPICALLY WHEN THAT IS USED
[ct=2305.090] THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT STABILITY
[ct=2306.479] OF THE BONE, NOT JUST A
[ct=2307.688] LIGAMENT.
[ct=2310.366] AL: OH, BOY.
[ct=2312.972] THE INJURY JUST PILING UP.
[ct=2321.006] MEANWHILE, YOU HAVE MCKINSTRY, A
[ct=2323.677] ROOKIE OUT OF ALABAMA, WHO IS
[ct=2326.338] VERY GOOD FRIENDS WITH NIX, WHO
[ct=2326.338] WENT TO AUBURN.
[ct=2328.974] SECOND DOWN AND 8.
[ct=2332.994] THE PASS IS CAUGHT FOR A FIRST
[ct=2336.984] FORWARD PROGRESS FOR LIL'JORDAN
[ct=2338.311] TACKLED BY TAYLOR.
[ct=2343.695] KIRK: IT IS INCREDIBLE, THE BALL
[ct=2343.695] IS THROWN RIGHT ON THE MONEY.
[ct=2349.009] WHEN HE HAS OPEN RECEIVERS, HE
[ct=2350.318] HAS STRUGGLED TONIGHT WITH HIS
[ct=2350.318] FOOTWORK AND ACCURACY.
[ct=2354.257] BOTH OF THESE DEFENSES IN THE
[ct=2356.895] RED ZONE, THEY ARE 1 AND 2.
[ct=2360.846] DENVER LEADS THE NFL IN RED ZONE
[ct=2362.202] DEFENSE AND THE SAINTS ARE
[ct=2362.202] NUMBER 2.
[ct=2363.588] YOU WILL HAVE TO EARN IT
[ct=2367.571] AL: FIRST AND GOAL, HALFWAY
[ct=2368.852] THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER.
[ct=2371.524] WIDE OPEN.
[ct=2374.190] JAVONTE WILLIAMS WITH A
[ct=2376.902] HE GOES IN UNTOUCHED.
[ct=2379.536] THEY COMPLETE THAT DRIVE.
[ct=2383.496] EIGHT PLAYS, FIVE ON THE GROUND.
[ct=2387.450] AN EIGHT YARD TOUCHDOWN HERE.
[ct=2390.106] IT TOOK 4:44 AND THEY ARE UP BY
[ct=2391.488] TWO SCORES.
[ct=2394.110] KIRK: YOU SEE THIS ONE OPEN UP.
[ct=2398.073] IT IS NOT ABOUT TACKLING ON THIS
[ct=2399.551] ONE, IT IS ABOUT GAP
[ct=2400.750] RESPONSIBILITY.
[ct=2403.374] AL: DENVER WAS TALKING ABOUT
[ct=2404.723] STARTING FASTER.
[ct=2407.359] IN THE SIX GAMES PRIOR TO
[ct=2410.058] TONIGHT THEY HAD BEEN SHUT OUT
[ct=2411.340] IN THE FIRST HALF AND THREE OF
[ct=2411.340] THEM.
[ct=2416.705] LUTZ FOR THE EXTRA POINT.
[ct=2418.015] WITH 7:30 REMAINING IN THE
[ct=2420.649] OPENING HALF, THE DENVER BRONCOS
[ct=2423.297] , TRYING TO GET TO ABOVE .500,
[ct=2427.289] LEADING THE SAINTS, 13-0.
[ct=2429.958] KIRK: THE LINEBACKER BLITZ IS
[ct=2431.266] PICKED UP BY THE CENTER.
[ct=2433.988] THE KICK OUT BLOCK AND THERE IS
[ct=2433.988] NO ONE LEFT.
[ct=2437.960] THAT IS ABOUT AS EASY AS IT CAN
[ct=2439.232] BE ONCE THE CENTER IS ABLE TO
[ct=2441.923] PICK UP THE BLITZING LINEBACKER,
[ct=2441.923] DEMARIO DAVIS.
[ct=2445.920] DENVER RIGHT NOW, OVER 100 YARDS
[ct=2445.920] RUSHING.
[ct=2449.849] AL: 102 ON THE GROUND AND THE
[ct=2453.878] SAINTS WITH NINE.
[ct=2457.835] DENNIS ALLEN HAS THAT LOOK AGAIN
[ct=2460.507] OF A TEAM THAT STARTED OUT ON
[ct=2464.554] FIRE, KNOCKED OFF CAROLINA IN
[ct=2464.554] THE OPENER.
[ct=2467.205] YOU THINK, NO BIG DEAL.
[ct=2469.878] DALLAS.
[ct=2471.185] AL:2-0.
[ct=2475.154] KLINT KUBIAK, WHAT A HIRE.
[ct=2477.881] WE STILL THINK HE IS BUT THE
[ct=2479.153] INJURIES ARE STARTING TO STACK
[ct=2481.924] AND THEN LOSING DEREK CARR.
[ct=2486.029] AL: THEY HAVE THE LEAD AGAINST
[ct=2486.029] PHILADELPHIA AND LOST AT THE
[ct=2487.205] END.
[ct=2496.688] MEANWHILE, IT IS JUGGLED BY
[ct=2496.688] JACKSON, WHO WILL RUN IT BACK.
[ct=2500.513] TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE MIDDLE
[ct=2500.513] OF THE COVERAGE UNIT.
[ct=2504.518] TO THE 20 YARD LINE HE GOES WITH
[ct=2505.846] SKINNER MAKING THE TACKLE.
[ct=2513.789] DENNIS ALLEN SPENT 12 YEARS WITH
[ct=2516.463] SEAN PAYTON ON THE STAFF TWO
[ct=2517.729] DIFFERENT TENURES.
[ct=2520.504] IN BETWEEN HE WAS HEAD COACH OF
[ct=2523.053] THE OAKLAND RAIDERS FOR TWO FULL
[ct=2524.413] SEASONS.
[ct=2527.047] DEREK CARR CAME IN AS A ROOKIE
[ct=2528.437] AND DENNIS ALLEN WAS STILL
[ct=2533.710] TRYING TO GET THIS TEAM TURNED
[ct=2539.029] SIX YARD GAIN FOR KAMARA A SUPER
[ct=2540.364] ALLEN.
[ct=2546.982] THEY WON IT ALL IN 2009 AGAINST
[ct=2548.326] THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS.
[ct=2550.973] THEY STATED HOUSE WHEN SEAN
[ct=2553.649] DECIDED TO STEP AWAY FROM
[ct=2553.649] FOOTBALL FOR A YEAR.
[ct=2556.301] HIS TEAM NOW WITH A SECOND DOWN
[ct=2557.602] AND 4.
[ct=2560.235] WILLIAMS GIVES TO THE 28 YARD
[ct=2561.565] THIRD DOWN.
[ct=2564.290] KIRK: ONE OF THE THINGS WE
[ct=2565.572] TALKED ABOUT AND HOW YOU WIN
[ct=2569.591] WHEN YOU ARE ON THE ROAD, YOU
[ct=2570.916] WANT TO MAKE THIS QUARTERBACK
[ct=2572.216] HAVE TO WORK A LONG FIELD.
[ct=2576.197] TONIGHT THEY HAVE STARTED DEEP
[ct=2577.541] IN THEIR OWN FIELD POSITION.
[ct=2580.185] A LOT OF TIMES AROUND THEIR OWN
[ct=2580.185] 20.
[ct=2584.141] VANCE JOSEPH, WHO BY THE WAY
[ct=2585.481] WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL IN THIS
[ct=2588.131] AREA, HE IS FIRED UP TO BE BACK

[ct=2590.815] NFL'S TOP

[ct=2598.795] PRESSURE.
[ct=2602.781] GETTING AWAY, KEEPING HIS EYES
[ct=2602.781] DOWNFIELD.
[ct=2605.444] CAN HE GET THE FIRST DOWN?
[ct=2609.410] HE IS BUMPED OUT SHORT OF IT BY
[ct=2610.797] BARTON, WHO IS HAVING A HECKUVA
[ct=2610.797] NIGHT.
[ct=2613.377] KIRK: THEY ARE PLAYING ZON
[ct=2614.764] THEIR EYES ARE ON THE
[ct=2618.735] WHEN BO NIX LOOKS TO RUN, HE IS
[ct=2620.047] TAKE OFF.
[ct=2622.699] RATTLER, HE HAS SOME ATHLETIC
[ct=2625.353] ABILITY, NO WATCHES LEFT-HAND.
[ct=2626.688] HE IS TRYING TO THROW.
[ct=2630.655] HE WAS NOT THINKING ABOUT
[ct=2630.655] GETTING THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2633.327] HE DID NOT HAVE ANOTHER RECEIVER
[ct=2634.761] OTHER THAN THE ONE THAT WAS
[ct=2634.761] DEEP.
[ct=2637.312] 55, CODY
[ct=2638.657] FIELD.
[ct=2641.304] AL: FOURTH AND INCHES, SAINTS
[ct=2642.581] WILL TAKE A TIMEOUT.
[ct=2646.584] IF YOU ARE NEW ORLEANS, HAVING

[ct=2651.900] IT BUT GOOD LUCK IF YOU DO NOT
[ct=2651.900] MAKE IT HERE.
[ct=2654.547] WE ARE APPROACHING THE

[ct=2657.221] KIRK: YEAH.
[ct=2659.865] AL: A LOT OF THINGS STAND OUT --
[ct=2659.865] NAME ONE.
[ct=2663.861] KIRK: HOW ABOUT THE MOVES WITH
[ct=2663.861] THE JETS?
[ct=2667.854] IT HAS BEEN A SOAP OPERA WITH
[ct=2669.168] EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN GOING
[ct=2669.168] ON.
[ct=2673.181] THE LATEST, DAVANTE ADAMS COMING
[ct=2673.181] OVER FROM LAS VEGAS.
[ct=2675.812] YOU KNEW HE WOULD GET MOVED, A
[ct=2677.159] LOT OF PEOPLE ASSUME HE WOULD

[ct=2682.444] BREAK THE NEWS THAT DAVANTE
[ct=2687.752] ADAMS IS COMING.
[ct=2689.098] WITH THE AMARI COOPER COMING

[ct=2698.391] THEY WILL LINE UP TO GO FOR IT
[ct=2698.391] AND THEY DO.
[ct=2705.071] AND IT IS FLOATED AND CAUGHT AND
[ct=2706.358] THEY GET A BREAK BY GETTING THE
[ct=2707.701] FIRST DOWN AS JUWAN JOHNSON IS
[ct=2714.360] THAT IS ABOUT AS SLOW DEVELOPING
[ct=2714.360] PLAY AND A
[ct=2715.788] GET THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2719.694] A GUTSY CALL BY KLINT KUBIAK.
[ct=2722.306] HE FLOATS THAT OVER THE TOP OF

[ct=2727.636] DEFENSE IS FOOLED ON THE FOURTH
[ct=2727.636] AND SHORT.
[ct=2728.946] NOBODY HOME.
[ct=2732.926] ABLE TO SECURE THAT AND PICK UP
[ct=2735.579] THAT IS A GUY -- JUWAN JOHNSON

[ct=2747.570] KAMARA IN HIS EIGHTH SEASON,
[ct=2750.166] LONGEST TENURE WITH ONE TEAM
[ct=2751.555] AMONG RUNNING BACKS.
[ct=2754.159] KIRK: THAT IS ONLY THE FOURTH
[ct=2754.159] TOUCH HE WOULD HAVE.
[ct=2756.878] I THOUGHT COMING INTO TONIGHT,
[ct=2758.168] IF THEY WERE GOING TO MOVE THE
[ct=2762.145] BALL, 41, WHETHER CATCHING THE
[ct=2763.428] BALL OR RUNNING, THEY HAVE TO
[ct=2763.428] GET HIM ON TRACK.
[ct=2766.198] KLINT KUBIAK FIGURING OUT
[ct=2767.492] DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET THE RHYTHM
[ct=2770.124] GOING WITH ALL OF HIS INJURIES
[ct=2770.124] AND HIS ROOKIE QUARTERBACK.
[ct=2775.480] TOSS HERE.
[ct=2780.744] RUNNING INTO A BRICK WALL AT THE
[ct=2780.744] 50-YARD LINE IS KAMARA.
[ct=2784.713] THAT TIME HE IS TAKEN
[ct=2786.074] JORDAN JACKSON.
[ct=2790.058] YOU LOOK AT KLINT KUBIAK, YOU
[ct=2791.333] CANNOT HELP BUT THINK
[ct=2792.678] WAS THE COACH OF THE DENVER
[ct=2795.338] BRONCOS WHEN THEY WON SUPER BOWL
[ct=2795.338] 50.
[ct=2798.020] STEPPED AWAY.
[ct=2803.297] KIRK: HIS SON HAS A HUGE FUTURE
[ct=2804.649] IN THIS BUSINESS.
[ct=2808.642] HE WAS AT SAN FRANCISCO LAST
[ct=2809.983] YEAR WITH KYLE SHANAHAN AS THE

[ct=2825.918] RATTLER IS OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE
[ct=2825.918] 20-YARD LINE.
[ct=2831.182] BROWNING ALMOST HAD HIM, COULD
[ct=2832.573] NOT SECURE HIM AND OFF HE G
[ct=2833.827] FOR 28.
[ct=2839.131] KIRK: THEY BRING EVERYONE UP,

[ct=2849.863] COVERAGE.
[ct=2852.539] THIS TIME HE IS LOOKING TO RUN
[ct=2853.874] ONCE HE GETS OUT OF THERE.

[ct=2982.662] DISGUISE MORE AND MAKE HIM GET A
[ct=2984.053] PRE-SNAP LOOK AND THEN GO TO

[ct=3006.552] GIVES US A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE
[ct=3006.552] STANDINGS RIGHT NOW.
[ct=3011.891] IN THE TWO DIVISIONS AND PLAY.
[ct=3013.260] THE AFC WEST, THE CHIEFS ARE
[ct=3014.532] UNBEATEN.
[ct=3015.867] IN THE SOUTH YOU HAVE THE
[ct=3019.852] FALCONS AND THE BUCS BOTH 4-2
[ct=3022.533] WITH THE SAINTS TRYING TO HANG
[ct=3023.850] IN AT 2-4.
[ct=3027.844] KIRK: THE RACE ON THE LEFT, FOR
[ct=3029.178] DENVER IT IS ABOUT TRUSTING THIS
[ct=3033.179] A TOP-5 DEFENSE IN THE ENTIRE
[ct=3033.179] LEAGUE.
[ct=3037.166] THERE ARE TIMES BO NIX AND THIS
[ct=3037.166] OFFENSE WILL KEEP G
[ct=3038.448] AND BETTER.
[ct=3039.773] AL: THIRD AND 11.
[ct=3042.428] PRESSURE, CAUGHT.
[ct=3045.126] TRYING TO BREAK AWAY AND GETS A
[ct=3049.114] COUPLE MORE YARDS TO THE 17-YARD
[ct=3051.762] LINE BUT WELL SHY OF THE FIRST

[ct=3095.614] DREW BREES IS GOING TO BE
[ct=3096.924] INTO THE HALL OF FAME.
[ct=3098.419] MEANWHILE, FOURTH DOWN AND 5.
[ct=3102.248] FOR A MOMENT, THEY LEFT THE
[ct=3102.248] OFFENSE OUT THERE.
[ct=3108.842] BLAKE GRUPE, WHO WAS SO GOOD
[ct=3111.542] LAST YEAR, THEY TREATED LET'S --
[ct=3112.861] TRADED UT
[ct=3118.360] TRADED ULUTZ, SENT HIM TO DENVER
[ct=3119.687] THIS WILL BE AT 35 YARD ATTEMPT.
[ct=3124.942] SNAP GOOD, HOLD GOOD.
[ct=3129.074] ON THE BOARD.
[ct=3130.356] 13-3.
[ct=3132.973] COUNTS, IT WILL BE QUITE
[ct=3134.344] VALUABLE, DON'T YOU THINK?
[ct=3139.676] DOES NOT LOOK LIKE X FOUR Z -- X
[ct=3140.947] OR Z.
[ct=3143.697] I'M TRYING TO THINK OF WHAT A
[ct=3146.291] GUYS NAME WOULD BE -- YOU WOULD
[ct=3146.291] JUST HAVE TO HAVE
[ct=3147.713] A FIRST NAME.
[ct=3150.266] THREE LETTERS IN THE SECOND.
[ct=3151.603] KIRK: I CANNOT THINK OF
[ct=3151.603] ANYTHING.
[ct=3154.279] AL: THIS IS WHAT WE DO IN
[ct=3155.583] THESE THINGS OUT.
[ct=3158.250] KIRK: THERE IS DAVIS WEBB, THE
[ct=3159.562] QUARTERBACK COACH, TALKING TO
[ct=3159.562] THEM BEFORE THE FIELD.
[ct=3162.203] THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY
[ct=3163.568] HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE IN THAT
[ct=3170.189] ROOM, AND ALREADY, A QUARTERBACK
[ct=3171.522] COACH FOR THE NFL.
[ct=3172.855] I'M SURE HE HAS GOT A BRIGHT
[ct=3175.536] FUTURE IN THIS BUSINESS.
[ct=3176.842] BY THE WAY, FIRST TIME THE
[ct=3179.507] BRONCOS HAVE HAD 100 YARDS
[ct=3184.796] PASSING SINCE 2020, 4 YEARS AGO.
[ct=3188.815] AL: RUNNING BACK FROM NIMS.
[ct=3190.109] INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=3192.736] BRING SET BACK OUT TO THE 28
[ct=3195.538] YARD LINE WITH 152.
[ct=3198.094] ONE TIMEOUT REMAINING FOR
[ct=3202.069] KIRK: IT HAS BEEN PRODUCTIVE
[ct=3204.710] FIRST HALF FOR BO NIX AND HIS
[ct=3206.056] OFFENSE, 13-3.
[ct=3208.687] LET'S SEE WHAT SEAN P
[ct=3210.091] DECIDES TO DO WITH HIS YOUNG
[ct=3214.030] SEE WHAT KIND OF COMPETENCY HAS
[ct=3215.351] WITH HIM.
[ct=3216.677] IF HE IS SECURE WITH A 10 POINT
[ct=3218.020] LEAD, OR IF YOU TRUST THEM TO
[ct=3219.335] KEEP ATTACKING HERE WITH THAT
[ct=3220.670] ONE TIMEOUT.
[ct=3223.356] AL: FROM THE 28.
[ct=3223.356] THEY BEGIN THIS DRIVE.
[ct=3227.301] NIX, 102 YARDS THROUGH THE AIR.
[ct=3229.962] 35 ON THE GROUND, ALSO.
[ct=3231.261] SWINGS WENT OUT HERE.
[ct=3235.232] MISSED TACKLE.
[ct=3240.573] SIX OR SO FOR JAVONTE WILLIAMS.
[ct=3243.233] KIRK: PEOPLE FORGET WILLIAMS
[ct=3244.547] WHEN HE WAS COMING OUT OF NORTH
[ct=3247.191] CAROLINA, WHAT KIND OF FUTURE A
[ct=3248.569] LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT HE COULD
[ct=3251.189] HAVE IN THE NFL AND HAD TO
[ct=3255.191] REALLY BAD INJURY, CAM
[ct=3256.526] FROM IT LAST YEAR AND WAS NOT
[ct=3257.837] QUITE THE SAME.
[ct=3259.137] THIS IS THE BEST HE HAS LOOKED
[ct=3260.503] SINCE THE INJURY, AS FAR AS THE
[ct=3261.893] HALF IS CONCERNED.
[ct=3271.146] AL: RUNNING DOWN TO 1.5 AND ON
[ct=3276.471] SECOND AND TWO AND AFTER THE
[ct=3280.457] TRAFFIC INTO THE 46 YARD LINE,
[ct=3283.063] AND LAUNCHED IT, SO THAT WILL
[ct=3285.772] MAKE IT THIRD DOWN AND 2.
[ct=3287.052] COULD NOT HOLD ON.
[ct=3288.395] GOOD-LOOKING ROOKIE OUT OF UTAH.
[ct=3292.378] TALKED ABOUT HIM, LOOKING FOR
[ct=3293.661] HIS FIRST CAREER.
[ct=3297.660] HE HAD EIGHT RECEPTIONS IN THE
[ct=3299.032] OPENER.
[ct=3299.032] CAME BACK WITH FOUR MORE LA
[ct=3301.661] THIRD AND 2.
[ct=3316.276] GOOD P
[ct=3317.658] OPEN.
[ct=3320.399] FIRST DOWN, RIGHT TO MIDFIELD
[ct=3322.996] GOES LUCAS KROLL, THE TIGHT END.
[ct=3327.011] CONSERVING THAT LAST TIMEOUT.
[ct=3328.329] A LITTLE OVER ONE MINUTE
[ct=3329.641] REMAINING IN THE HALF.
[ct=3333.651] KIRK: GREAT COMMUNICATION BY THE
[ct=3334.951] OFFENSIVE LINE AND GIVE BO NIX
[ct=3336.402] ENOUGH TIME ON THAT THIRD DOWN.
[ct=3340.265] AL: STAYS IN THE POCKET BUT HAS
[ct=3341.579] TO THROW IT AWAY.
[ct=3342.953] THAT WILL BE A FLAG.
[ct=3348.296] KIRK: JAVONTE WILLIAMS WAS RIGHT
[ct=3348.296] THERE, RIGHT AT HIS FEET.
[ct=3352.218] HE GOT LOST IN THE SHUFFLE WITH
[ct=3353.540] ALL THOSE LINEMEN, BUT HE WAS
[ct=3353.540] RIGHT THERE.
[ct=3358.898] AL: ANNOUNCED IN THE
[ct=3360.169] RECEIVER IN THE AREA?
[ct=3361.502] NO GROUNDING.
[ct=3362.853] KIRK: HE THROWS IT RIGHT AT HIS
[ct=3364.161] FEET.
[ct=3373.446] FROM THE 49.
[ct=3377.456] KIRK: THIS IS USUALLY WHERE THEY
[ct=3381.462] LIKE TO GET SUTTON INVOLVED.
[ct=3381.462] RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM.
[ct=3384.046] AL: THEY HAVE NOT EVEN TARGETED
[ct=3385.474] HIM TONIGHT.
[ct=3388.054] PRESSURE, THROWING, ALMOST
[ct=3389.396] PICKED OVER THE 34 YARD LINE.
[ct=3393.464] RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF TIME
[ct=3394.811] MATTHEW, NO STRANGER TO
[ct=3402.825] INTERCEPTIONS -- MATTHEW, NO
[ct=3404.105] STRANGER TO INTERCEPTIONS.
[ct=3406.774] EASY.
[ct=3409.404] KIRK: BO NIX, IT IS LIKE
[ct=3410.765] THROUGH BETWEEN TWO RECEIVERS,
[ct=3416.049] THE CROSSING, AND DOWNFIELD,
[ct=3416.049] RIGHT IN BETWEEN HIM.
[ct=3418.728] ALMOST A FAIR CATCH FOR MATTHEW.
[ct=3420.034] THE LAST GUY ON THE FIELD THAT
[ct=3421.373] YOU TAKE WOULD DROP A SHORT
[ct=3422.665] INTERCEPTION.
[ct=3425.364] AL: ABSOLUTELY, ALMOST TOO EASY.
[ct=3427.972] THIRD AND 10.
[ct=3433.319] NI, BUYING TIME -- NIX, BUYING
[ct=3434.675] TIME.
[ct=3435.968] A BROKEN TACKLE, AND MIMS IS
[ct=3437.281] ABLE TO GET THAT EXTRA YARDAGE.
[ct=3439.943] I THINK THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3442.607] KIRK: WE TALKED ABOUT THAT LAST
[ct=3443.948] PASS WHEN HE SHOWED CONFIDENCE
[ct=3446.622] IN HIS YOUNG QUARTERBACK JUST
[ct=3447.943] BECAUSE THE POTENTIAL OF A PASS
[ct=3450.558] THAT COULD COST HIM POINTS.
[ct=3451.904] YET, HE COMES RIGHT BACK WITH
[ct=3454.541] THE NEXT CALL AFTER THAT POOR
[ct=3455.869] DECISION BY BO NIX, BECOMES
[ct=3458.555] RIGHT BACK TO SHOW CONFIDENCE
[ct=3459.920] AND TO LOOK DOWNFIELD.
[ct=3462.544] HE CHECKS IT DOWN, AND BREAKS UP
[ct=3463.872] THE TACKLE AND PICKS UP THAT
[ct=3469.195] AL: BRONCOS RUNNING THEIR 38TH
[ct=3469.195] PLAY.
[ct=3472.034] ONLY 21.
[ct=3476.040] PRESSURE COMING.
[ct=3478.712] NIX THROWS.
[ct=3478.712] A LITTLE BIT SHORT.
[ct=3482.698] MARVIN MIMS IS THERE.
[ct=3486.659] KIRK: THAT WAS A GREAT THROUGH
[ct=3490.699] -- THROW, CONSIDERING THE
[ct=3493.305] HE HAD TO GET THE BALL OUT WELL
[ct=3495.940] BEFORE WAS THINKING OF COMING
[ct=3495.940] BACK TO THE FOOT -- BEFORE MIMS
[ct=3498.667] WAS THINKING OF COMING BACK TO
[ct=3498.667] THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=3501.282] SO THAT BALL IS EASILY
[ct=3501.282] CATCHABLE.
[ct=3505.278] BUT THE SAINTS HAVE DIALED UP
[ct=3506.569] THE PRESSURE ON THIS DRIVE, AND
[ct=3509.299] THAT TIME HE IS FORCED TO THROW
[ct=3509.299] IT A LITTLE BIT
[ct=3510.549] ENOUGH ON HIM.
[ct=3513.265] AL: SECOND AND 10.
[ct=3519.984] NIX, GOING TO RUN IT.
[ct=3523.938] NIX HAS CARRIED THE BALL SEVEN
[ct=3525.260] IT IS GREAT TO
[ct=3529.257] THEY TAKE A TIMEOUT TERRY HOW
[ct=3529.257] MUCH DO YOU WANT YOUR
[ct=3531.896] QUARTERBACK RUNNING -- HOW
[ct=3534.523] -- THEY TAKE A TIMEOUT.
[ct=3535.876] HOW MUCH
[ct=3537.220] QUARTERBACK RUNNING?
[ct=3539.848] KIRK: BECAUSE OF THE SCREEN, BY
[ct=3542.542] MIMS, IT WAS PICKED UP BY CARL
[ct=3543.863] GRANDERSON, SO HE DID THE SMART
[ct=3543.863] THING.
[ct=3546.500] WATCH GRANDERSON SNIFF THIS OUT.
[ct=3547.835] WAIT A MINUTE, SOMETHING IS
[ct=3549.153] GOING ON.
[ct=3550.454] HE IS RIGHT THERE WITH THE
[ct=3551.868] RECEIVER, TAKES THEM AWAY.
[ct=3554.461] BO NIX IS FORCED WITH MEN
[ct=3557.166] DOWNFIELD, FORCED TO RUN IT AND
[ct=3558.445] GET SOMETHING POSITIVE OUT OF IT
[ct=3558.445] AND USE THE LAST TIMEOUT.
[ct=3565.125] AL: BALL AT THE 37, SO IF YOU DO
[ct=3566.450] NOT GAIN ANOTHER YARD, YOU COULD
[ct=3567.778] BE LOOKING AT A 55 YARD FIELD
[ct=3567.778] GOAL.
[ct=3570.440] THE SAINTS WILL GET THE
[ct=3573.048] BALL WHEN WE START THE SECOND
[ct=3573.048] HALF.
[ct=3578.368] FIVE RUSHING YARDS, 59 FOR
[ct=3582.339] WILLIAMS, 38 FOR NIX.
[ct=3585.086] KIRK: THIRD DOWN HAS BEEN A
[ct=3587.674] NIGHTMARE FOR THEM THIS YEAR.
[ct=3587.674] BUT TONIGHT THEY HAVE BEEN
[ct=3588.998] PRETTY GOOD.
[ct=3590.341] AL: THEY ARE THREE OUT OF SIX.
[ct=3594.362] KIRK: THEY MOVE SUTTON FROM THE
[ct=3596.947] LEFT ALL THE WAY TO THE RIGHT
[ct=3598.318] AGAINST THE ROOKIE.
[ct=3599.687] AL: NUMBER 14.
[ct=3604.961] 37 -- THIRD AND SEVEN.
[ct=3608.945] NIX WILL TAKE OFF AGAIN AND
[ct=3610.272] SCOOTS OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=3614.251] A LITTLE BIT SHY.
[ct=3615.580] THEY ARE GOING TO SEND IN THE
[ct=3616.858] FIELD GOAL UNIT NOW WITH 21
[ct=3618.256] SECONDS AND NO TIMEOUTS
[ct=3618.256] REMAINING.
[ct=3622.225] KIRK: SO HE GETS A YARDS ON THE
[ct=3623.556] SCRAMBLE.
[ct=3623.556] GETS OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=3626.209] GOING TO HAVE TO HURRY IT UP
[ct=3627.577] HERE TO TAKE THE FIELD GOAL.
[ct=3630.175] AT LEAST TO GET SOME INTO FIELD
[ct=3630.175] GOAL RANGE.
[ct=3632.824] -- AT LEAST TO GET SOME
[ct=3636.851] AL: THIS HAS BECOME ALMOST A
[ct=3636.851] CHIP SHOT THESE DAYS.
[ct=3642.161] 50, 59, HITTING THREE
[ct=3643.446] OF THEIR ATTEMPTS.
[ct=3644.940] HERE IS ANOTHER ONE.
[ct=3648.819] 52 YARD FIELD GOAL IS GOOD.
[ct=3651.519] HE HAS THREE FIELD GOALS
[ct=3664.722] AL: SO, THE ROOKIE FROM OREGON,
[ct=3668.693] 41 GROUND YARDS, THEY HAVE HAD
[ct=3671.353] THE BALL ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF
[ct=3674.032] THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=3675.352] CONTROLLING THE PACE, THE TEMPO.
[ct=3685.973] TOUCHBACK.
[ct=3691.274] KIRK: THIS DEFENSE FROM DENVER
[ct=3691.274] HAS LIVED UP TO THE BILLING.
[ct=3693.977] TOP FIVE IN A LOT OF CATEGORIES.
[ct=3696.589] A NO-NAME DEFENSE.
[ct=3699.258] WE PROBABLY DON'T KNOW A LOT OF
[ct=3700.591] THE PLAYERS, BUT THEY PLAY WELL
[ct=3701.912] AS A UNIT, UNDERSTANDING THE
[ct=3704.551] PURPOSE, GOING AGAINST THIS
[ct=3707.204] ROOKIE QUARTERBACK, RELYING ON
[ct=3709.877] THE FRONT TO GET HOME AND TO GET
[ct=3709.877] THAT PRESSURE WITHOUT HAVING THE
[ct=3711.188] BLITZ, EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE A
[ct=3713.831] BLITZ TEAM, SECOND AND THE
[ct=3716.505] ENTIRE NFL AS FAR AS BLITZ AND
[ct=3717.857] PRESSURE, BUT THEY HAVE RELIED
[ct=3720.503] ON THE FRONT AND ALLOW THAT
[ct=3721.827] SECOND AND THIRD TO KEEP THEIR
[ct=3721.827] EYES ON THE QUARTERBACK.
[ct=3725.796] AL: OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=3727.159] THAT GOES NOWHERE.
[ct=3733.763] TACKLED BY MCMILLAN.
[ct=3739.079] WOULD LIKE TO REEMPHASIZE THE
[ct=3743.055] MAC.
[ct=3747.038] TAKE ABOUT 11 SECONDS HERE.
[ct=3747.038] YOU ARE TRYING T
[ct=3749.686] KIRK: MAYBE TRY TO GET API.
[ct=3752.377] THINK ABOUT IF YOU ARE SPENCER
[ct=3752.377] RATTLER.
[ct=3755.056] YOU DECIDED TO STEP IN FOR DEREK
[ct=3759.004] CARR AND GET AN OPPORTUNITY AND
[ct=3760.378] IN YOUR FIRST CAREER START TO GO
[ct=3761.637] UP AGAINST SCOTT BOWLES AND
[ct=3762.996] THEY GET CREATIVE WITH THEIR
[ct=3762.996] BLITZ PACKAGE.
[ct=3765.617] DREW BREES WILL BE HONORED HERE
[ct=3765.617] AT HALFTIME.
[ct=3768.322] AND THEN THE SECOND GAME, HE IS
[ct=3769.630] GOING UP AGAINST JOSEPH AND HIS
[ct=3770.942] THAT IS HIS INTRODUC
[ct=3772.305] NFL.
[ct=3773.656] AL: TWO OF THE BEST.
[ct=3777.605] DREW WILL JOIN US FOR A SEGMENT
[ct=3778.947] OR TWO IN THE BOOTH IN THE THIRD
[ct=3782.962] MEANWHILE, UNDER PRESSURE, AND
[ct=3785.546] THAT IS THE WAY THIS HALF IS
[ct=3786.918] GOING TO END, IN ALL LIKELIHOOD,
[ct=3788.276] BUT THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE
[ct=3790.878] ANOTHER TIMEOUT?
[ct=3790.878] I GUESS.
[ct=3794.880] FOR WHAT PRACTICAL PURPOSE?
[ct=3794.880] TELL ME.
[ct=3797.529] EVEN YOU ARE STUMPED.
[ct=3798.897] AND TO DO THAT IS HARD.
[ct=3801.493] KIRK: YOU ARE EXCITED OR WHAT
[ct=3802.858] GOING ON BEHIND THIS WALL RIGHT
[ct=3802.858] HERE AT HALFTIME.
[ct=3804.138] ARE YOU HUNGRY?
[ct=3805.486] AL: IT DEPENDS
[ct=3806.857] I HAVE TO SEE.
[ct=3809.465] KIRK: WHAT IS ON THE MENU.
[ct=3810.817] AL: WHAT ARE WE HAVING TONIGHT?
[ct=3813.457] CAJUN OR CREOLE?
[ct=3816.121] KIRK: A GREAT TOWNKIRK: --
[ct=3817.461] KIRK: A GREAT TOWN FOR FOOD.
[ct=3818.769] AL: SURE.
[ct=3821.808] FUMBLE, PUNT FIELD GOAL FOR THE
[ct=3826.898] YOU WILL TAKE A TIMEOUT?
[ct=3829.394] THAT IS THE ONLY ONE I HAVE EVER
[ct=3830.789] SEEN, AND A KNEEL DOWN FOLLOWS.
[ct=3833.372] KIRK: AND NOW THEY'RE GOING TO
[ct=3834.725] GET BOOED OFF.
[ct=3836.057] AL: I KNOW, WHATEVER.
[ct=3838.718] 16-3 IS THE HALFTIME SCORE.
[ct=3842.693] IN THE LAST 60 MINUTES OF PLAY,
[ct=3846.692] THIE SAINTS HAVE SCORED THREE
[ct=3846.692] POINTS.
[ct=3851.957] BRONCOS ON TOP BY 13.
[ct=3857.295] KAYLEE: FOUR SCORING
[ct=3858.671] TOUCHDOWN, HOW DO YOU ASSESS BO
[ct=3858.671] NIX?
[ct=3863.936] >> WE ARE RUNNING IT WELL, BO IS
[ct=3863.936] MOVING WELL.
[ct=3865.266] I HATE SETTLING FOR FIELD GOALS.
[ct=3867.970] THE SECOND HALF, THAT'S THE
[ct=3867.970] FIRST THING
[ct=3869.275] ABOUT OFFENSIVELY.
[ct=3871.952] KAYLEE: NO TARGETS FOR COURTLAND
[ct=3871.952] SUTTON.
[ct=3874.535] >> I THINK YOU'RE GETTING A LOT
[ct=3875.887] MORE ZONE.
[ct=3879.873] THEY ARE TRYING TO KEEP THEIR
[ct=3879.873] EYES ON THE Q.
[ct=3887.864] WHEN YOU ARE IN M SOMETIMESAN,
[ct=3889.190] HE CAN COVER MORE, SO A LOT MORE
[ct=3890.509] ZONE COVERAGE AND WE HAVE SEEN.
[ct=3893.195] AL: HALFTIME COMING UP, THE
[ct=3895.859] STATE FARMQUARTERBACK COMPARISON
[ct=3895.859] IS IMPRESSIVE.
[ct=3898.441] RATTLER IS STILL TIME TO GET
[ct=3899.798] SOMETHING GOING.
[ct=3902.438] KIRK: WHEN YOU HAVE ROOKIE
[ct=3902.438] QUARTERBACKS, THE GAME STILL
[ct=3905.107] MOVING REAL FAST FOR THESE GUYS.
[ct=3909.122] ESPECIALLY IN RATTLER'S CASE,
[ct=3910.452] WHERE HE WAS INACTIVE THE FIRST
[ct=3913.084] FIVE WEEKS OF THE SEASON, PLAYED
[ct=3914.395] LAST WEEK AND NOW HERE HE IS ON
[ct=3915.742] A SHORT WEEK WITH A LOT OF
[ct=3917.052] INJURIES ON HIS OFFENSIVE LINE,
[ct=3917.052] TRYING TO FIGURE THINGS OUT.
[ct=3918.404] THAT IS TOUGH TO DO.
[ct=3922.338] AL: SAINTS WILL TAKE IT TO THE
[ct=3922.338] 30 YARD LINE MOMENTS AGO.
[ct=3927.686] KAYLEE: TACKLING WAS A BIG POINT
[ct=3927.686] OF EMPHASIS THIS WEEK.
[ct=3928.996] HOW DO YOU FEEL YOUR DEFENSE
[ct=3928.996] DID?
[ct=3932.964] >> WE WERE BETTER TACKLING, BUT
[ct=3934.343] WE STILL GOT A LOT OF THINGS TO
[ct=3934.343] FIX AND CORRECT.
[ct=3938.304] IT WAS UNFORTUNATE WE GAVE UP
[ct=3940.926] THE THREE POINTS ON THE
[ct=3942.287] TWO-MINUTE DRIVE, BUT THE
[ct=3942.287] BIGGEST THING HAS BEEN THE
[ct=3944.949] THE QUARTERBACK HAS BEEN ABLE TO
[ct=3946.288] RUN AND SCRAMBLE.
[ct=3947.630] KAYLEE: WHAT WAS YOUR MESSAGE TO
[ct=3948.933] HALF?
[ct=3950.254] >> GO OUT, KEEP PLAYING.
[ct=3951.595] HE HAS DONE GOOD THINGS.
[ct=3954.276] HIM, TOO.
[ct=3955.576] KAYLEE: THANK YOU.
[ct=3956.884] AL: THANK YOU.
[ct=3959.577] MEANWHILE, IT IS DROPPED AREA
[ct=3960.869] HAVE TO MAKE SOME PLAYS.
[ct=3966.194] CEDRIC WILSON DROPPING THE
[ct=3966.194] SECOND DOWN.
[ct=3968.828] KIRK: SPENCER RATTLER IS MAKING
[ct=3970.169] HIS SECOND CAREER START, WORTH
[ct=3970.169] MENTIONING.
[ct=3972.834] YOU HAVE YOUR TWO BEST RECEIVERS
[ct=3974.157] OUT OF THE LINEUP.
[ct=3976.835] YOUR STARTING CENTER, WHO IS
[ct=3978.154] OUTSTANDING, MCCOY, IS ON THE
[ct=3980.801] NJOKU -- I.R..
[ct=3983.472] THE RIGHT AND LEFT GUARDS ARE
[ct=3987.437] HILL IS OUT, AND YOU ARE TRYING
[ct=3987.437] TO PUT TOGETHER SOME CONTINUITY.
[ct=3990.150] AGAINST ONE OF THE BETTER
[ct=3991.489] DEFENSES IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=3994.151] AL: HE SWINGS IT OUT.
[ct=3996.752] HE SAW NUMBER THREE, JAKE
[ct=3999.373] HAENER, WHO WOULD BE THE BACKUP
[ct=4000.735] QUARTERBACK RIGHT NOW.
[ct=4000.735] THERE HE IS.
[ct=4002.070] WHAT DO YOU DO?
[ct=4004.706] DO YOU PUT HIM IN AT SOME POINT
[ct=4004.706] IN THE GAME?
[ct=4008.693] HELLO ROOKIE, YOU HAVE RATTLER
[ct=4008.693] DOING HIS THING.
[ct=4010.085] OF COURSE, DEREK CARR.
[ct=4012.700] KIRK: THERE IS HILL ON THE LEFT.
[ct=4015.329] I THINK WHAT YOU DO IS YOU HAVE
[ct=4016.653] GOT TO STICK WITH THIS GUY
[ct=4019.324] BECAUSE HE IS MOVING.
[ct=4021.979] HE IS ATHLETIC ENOUGH, MUCH MORE
[ct=4023.280] THAN JAKE HAENER, TO GET AWAY
[ct=4024.663] FROM THIS PRESSURE
[ct=4025.974] LINE IS CREATING.
[ct=4029.973] AL: MORE PRESSURE, AND HE FIRES
[ct=4031.237] THIS ONE, DROPPED RIGHT THERE.
[ct=4033.994] COVERAGE IS GOOD, BUT JOHNSON
[ct=4036.574] HAD TO CATCH THE THROUGH THERE,
[ct=4037.956] AND IT IS FOURTH DOWN AND 7.
[ct=4039.226] KIRK: MATHIS IS BACK.
[ct=4041.924] HE HAD AN ANKLE T
[ct=4043.239] OUT OF THE LINEUP AND THAT IS
[ct=4044.590] WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE.
[ct=4047.185] THEY ARE LOOKING FOR PLAYMAKERS
[ct=4049.833] WITH THE TOP TWO RECEIVERS DOWN,
[ct=4055.177] HE MAY GET A LITTLE COLD, BUT
[ct=4056.523] YOU LOOK TO SEE JOHNSON WORK
[ct=4056.523] BACK TO THE BALL AND MAKE THAT
[ct=4059.158] CATCH, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE
[ct=4063.153] AL: THEY START THE SECOND HALF
[ct=4067.154] WITH A 39 SECOND THREE AND OUT.
[ct=4071.151] AND HEY WALL'S KICK FIELDED TO
[ct=4071.151] THE TWO YARD LINE.
[ct=4072.470] MIMS.
[ct=4075.100] DECENT RUN BACK.
[ct=4076.473] OUT TO THE 34.
[ct=4080.468] KIRK: THE FIRST HALF, THE MOST
[ct=4081.734] POSITIVE THING FOR BO NIX AND
[ct=4083.084] DENVER IS THE FACT THAT THEY GOT
[ct=4083.084] A PUSH.
[ct=4084.397] LOOK AT THESE HOLES.
[ct=4087.058] THIS IS NOT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AT
[ct=4088.409] ALL FROM DENVER.
[ct=4092.370] IT IS ALLOWING JAVONTE WILLIAMS,
[ct=4093.687] AND HE HAS BEEN THERE TO GET
[ct=4093.687] THEM TO THE SECOND A
[ct=4095.057] LEVEL.
[ct=4096.374] LOOK AT THE OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=4104.364] THEY ARE DOING A HECKUVA JOB,
[ct=4105.645] OPENING UP HOLES, NOT MAKING BO
[ct=4108.311] NIX, LIKE LAST WEEK, FEELING
[ct=4109.673] LIKE THEY COULD NOT RUN THE BALL
[ct=4109.673] AS WELL.
[ct=4112.304] THEY PUT A LOT ON BO NIX THE
[ct=4113.672] PAST GAME BUT NOT TONIGHT.
[ct=4115.016] AT LEAST THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=4120.228] AL: ON THE GROUND HERE.
[ct=4121.575] ANOTHER GOOD RUN BY WILLIAMS.
[ct=4128.250] KIRK: BRYAN BRESEE, HE IS IN THE
[ct=4130.871] YOU TALK ABOUT DENVER, WHA
[ct=4132.174] GOOD JOB THEY ARE DOING WITH
[ct=4134.883] THEIR OFFENSIVE LINE, BUT CRESE
[ct=4138.844] -- BRESEE IS RIGHT THERE.
[ct=4140.162] INSTEAD, IT IS A MISSED TACKLE.
[ct=4142.902] AND JOVAN TAYLOR WILLIAMS,
[ct=4146.863] TOUGH RUNNING.
[ct=4148.150] THEY HAVE BEEN OPENING HOLES ON
[ct=4148.150] HOW HE RUNS
[ct=4150.800] ON THIS ONE, IT WAS THE
[ct=4152.123] YOU GOT PENETRATION.
[ct=4153.437] HE WAS ABLE TO SHAKE IT.
[ct=4160.066] AL: THE ROOKIE IS THE RUNNING
[ct=4164.052] FIRST DOWN PLAY, GIVEN TO HIM,
[ct=4166.795] AND A NICE RUN TO THE 46 YARD
[ct=4170.757] LINE, CHEWING HIM UP ON THE
[ct=4172.036] GROUND HERE, THAT IS 121 RUSHING
[ct=4173.402] YARDS.
[ct=4176.030] KIRK: NOT TO GET INTO THE
[ct=4181.354] MINUTIA AS FAR AS FOUR-POINT --
[ct=4183.969] 47 YARDS, BUT THEY ARE NEAR THE
[ct=4186.673] BOTTOM COMING INTO THE NIGHT ON
[ct=4188.034] PENETRATION AND ALLOWING
[ct=4189.344] DEFENSES TO BE ABLE TO SLOW THE
[ct=4190.651] RUNNING BACKS DOWN BEFORE THEY
[ct=4190.651] GET STARTED.
[ct=4194.678] TONIGHT, THEY HAVE DONE A MUCH
[ct=4195.946] BETTER JOB OF CREATING SOME
[ct=4197.300] HOLES.
[ct=4202.575] AL: BY THE WAY, THAT IS MINUT
[ct=4203.930] 2.0.
[ct=4205.266] HERE'S MCLAUGHLIN.
[ct=4205.266] LOOK AT THIS.
[ct=4209.258] MCLAUGHLIN, AND THEY FINALLY
[ct=4209.258] STOPPED, THE 25 YARD LINE.
[ct=4213.265] MATTHEW -- TYRANN MATHIEU
[ct=4215.860] THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=4217.214] GREAT OPENING DRIVE IN PROGRE
[ct=4218.530] FOR THE BRONCOS.
[ct=4219.859] KIRK: A LITTLE EYE CANDY.
[ct=4225.190] THIS IS JUST A TOSS THAT YOU ARE
[ct=4226.491] ABLE TO GET YOUR MORE TALENTED
[ct=4227.844] PLAYMAKER IN SPACE OUT THERE
[ct=4227.844] AGAIN.
[ct=4231.844] A NICE PICKUP FOR ANDERSON AND
[ct=4234.472] SOME ROOM TO RUN FOR ANOTHER
[ct=4234.472] DENVER RUNNING BACK.
[ct=4239.780] AND SEAN PAYTON HAS GOT TO BE SO
[ct=4239.780] HAPPY WITH WHAT HE
[ct=4241.173] THIS OFFENSIVE LINE NOW.
[ct=4245.144] AL: GREAT OPENING SECOND HALF.
[ct=4247.757] DRIVE FOR THE BRONCOS FROM THE
[ct=4249.090] 25 YARD LINE.
[ct=4249.090] TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=4250.438] BACK INSIDE.
[ct=4253.045] FINALLY, THEY CORRALLED HIM.
[ct=4254.396] JAVONTE WILLIAMS.
[ct=4257.113] SECOND DOWN, SECOND AND 9.
[ct=4262.345] KIRK: THEY COULD RUN THE BALL
[ct=4263.700] DOWN THE ENTIRE FIELD.
[ct=4266.346] I'M SURE BO NIX IS GOING TO HAVE
[ct=4266.346] TO MAKE A PLAY HERE.
[ct=4272.968] THE SAINTS.
[ct=4275.649] AL: 20TH IN THE LEAGUE AGAINST
[ct=4275.649] THE RUN.
[ct=4278.322] THEY HAVE GIVEN UP MORE THAN
[ct=4283.658] AVERAGE, 105TH AND 23 CARRIES,
[ct=4284.954] OVER FIVE YARDS PER.
[ct=4286.264] SECOND AND 9.
[ct=4292.923] COMING, HANGS IN THERE, AND THEY
[ct=4294.240] CAUGHT IT AT THE 20 YARD LINE,
[ct=4296.880] TROY FRANKLIN, MAKING IT THIRD
[ct=4298.254] DOWN AND 5.
[ct=4306.176] SO THE BRONCOS, OF COURSE, THEY
[ct=4308.836] HAD THE SITUATION OVER TWO
[ct=4312.883] YEARS, AND THEN THEY KNEW THEY
[ct=4314.153] HAD TO GO INTO THE DRAFT, COULD
[ct=4318.160] HAVE TREATED UP, BUT THEY WAITED
[ct=4318.160] , AND THEY STILL HAD A GUY THEY
[ct=4323.445] WANTED AS THE NUMBER 12 PICK.
[ct=4327.482] KIRK: AND I THINK HE IS A GUY
[ct=4328.786] EVERYBODY WANTED, BUT I THINK BO
[ct=4331.411] NIX FITS
[ct=4332.751] YOU WOULD LIKE TO GROW THE
[ct=4334.085] OFFENSE.
[ct=4335.485] AL: THIRD DOWN AND 5.
[ct=4338.088] AND INTO THE CORNER OF THE END
[ct=4339.389] ZONE, AND INCOMPLETE.
[ct=4342.050] COVERAGE WAS VERY GOODBYE
[ct=4344.710] TAYLOR.
[ct=4346.062] -- GOOD BY TAYLOR.
[ct=4347.338] THEY BECOME THE FIELD GOAL GROUP
[ct=4352.675] WATCH HIM WORK THROUGH TRAFFIC
[ct=4354.012] IN THIS FORMATION.
[ct=4355.343] HE HAS GOT TO BE ABLE TO WORK
[ct=4358.017] AROUND ONE OF HIS OWN PLAYERS.
[ct=4358.017] HE DOES A GOO
[ct=4359.374] HIS EYES TURNED BACK TO THE
[ct=4360.707] FOOTBALL.
[ct=4363.349] ONCE HE FELT HUMPHREY LOOK BACK
[ct=4365.991] FOR THE BALL, HE DID A GOOD JOB
[ct=4367.408] OF GETTING HIS OWN EYES TURNED
[ct=4368.638] BACK, WAS ABLE TO LOCATE AND
[ct=4370.012] KNOCK IT AWAY.
[ct=4372.598] AL: TEXTBOOK, 38 YARD ATTEMPT.
[ct=4376.584] AND HE IS NOW FOUR FOR FOUR.
[ct=4380.649] A.
[ct=4384.598] 'OF TIME -- WHAT A PERIOD OF
[ct=4387.223] TIME, SEAN PAYTON AND DREW BREES
[ct=4388.557] HOOKING UP TOGETHER.
[ct=4392.565] DREW IS GOING TO JOIN US INTO
[ct=4393.845] THE BOOTH AFTER HE WAS INDUCTED
[ct=4395.170] INTO THE SAINT HALL OF FAME --
[ct=4395.170] SAINT HALL OF FAME.
[ct=4400.551] THIS DRIVE WILL START FROM
[ct=4401.990] 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=4403.252] HERE HE IS.
[ct=4404.634] I'M READING ABOUT YOU AND THE
[ct=4404.634] PAPER TODAY.
[ct=4407.229] YOU ARE OPENING UP A PICKLEBAL
[ct=4408.550] FACILITY.
[ct=4409.835] HOW IS RETIREMENT TREATING YOU?
[ct=4411.220] DREW: LIFE AFTER FOOTBALL.
[ct=4413.886] IF YOU CAN'T PLAY ANYMORE, YOU
[ct=4413.886] HAVE TO PICK UP THE PADDLE.
[ct=4416.523] IT IS GOOD.
[ct=4417.899] A LOT OF FAMILY TIME, COACHING
[ct=4420.502] HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL, AND POPP
[ct=4425.804] WARNER, SHOUT OUT TO THE EAGLES.
[ct=4425.804] WE ARE DOWN THE STRETCHER IN THE
[ct=4427.154] PLAYOFFS.
[ct=4428.459] THAT IS FILLING A LOT OF TIME.
[ct=4431.149] AL: YOUR TEAM WILL
[ct=4432.489] WHITWORTH'S TEAM AT SOME TIME.
[ct=4433.768] DREW: I HOPE SO.
[ct=4437.741] AL: THIS DRIVE BEGINNING FROM
[ct=4439.078] THE 30 YARD LINE, STARTING WITH
[ct=4439.078] MILLER.
[ct=4443.088] I THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU SIGN HERE
[ct=4444.417] , YOU HAVE SAN DIEGO, THE
[ct=4448.396] SURGERY, AND THEN I THINK MIAMI
[ct=4449.706] TURNED YOU DOWN BECAUSE OF A
[ct=4451.116] SHOULDER.
[ct=4452.389] NEW ORLEANS, THE CITY WAS
[ct=4453.730] DECIMATED.
[ct=4456.366] YOU HAVE A NEW COACH, NOT EVEN
[ct=4457.687] KNOWING IF YOU COULD PLAY IN THE
[ct=4459.039] BUILDING.
[ct=4459.039] WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
[ct=4460.434] THAT POINT?
[ct=4464.367] DREW: SEAN PAYTON GOT LOST
[ct=4465.652] DURING OUR VISIT, AND HE SHOWED
[ct=4466.983] US THINGS HE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO,
[ct=4466.983] WHICH WAS THE DEVASTATION.
[ct=4469.671] AND IT HAD THE REVERSE EFFECT.
[ct=4473.724] IT MADE ME REALIZE THIS WAS MORE
[ct=4473.724] THAN FOOTBALL.
[ct=4480.393] AL: THERE IS A GRAB, BUT A
[ct=4481.647] TACKLE THERE.
[ct=4484.482] KIRK: I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT WHEN
[ct=4485.642] YOU COME BACK, AND I KNOW YOU
[ct=4488.335] COME BACK WITH YOUR FAMILY, IT
[ct=4489.630] IS NOT JUST ABOUT FOOTBALL.
[ct=4492.315] WHAT DOES THE REGION MEAN TO YOU
[ct=4493.648] BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS YOU HAD
[ct=4494.957] ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD AND WHAT
[ct=4496.297] IT MEANT TO THE CITY
[ct=4497.581] IT REVITALIZED IT?
[ct=4501.685] DREW: THIS REGION, COMMUNITY,
[ct=4502.982] FAN BASE, IT SHAPED US ALL.
[ct=4505.585] ALL THE GUYS PART OF THE JOURNEY
[ct=4508.288] DURING THE SEAN PAYTON ERA FROM
[ct=4511.000] 2006 UNTIL WE WERE TIRED, WE
[ct=4512.180] EXPERIENCED INCREDIBLE THINGS
[ct=4515.538] BUT WE HAD BETTER PLAYERS AS A
[ct=4516.705] RESULT OF BEING A PART OF THIS.
[ct=4519.860] AL: FLAG HERE ON WHAT WAS A
[ct=4520.491] THIRD DOWN AND 11.
[ct=4523.584] WHAT DO YOU THINK SO FAR OF YOUR
[ct=4525.462] ROOKIE QUARTERBACK?
[ct=4527.003] DREW: HE IS AN EXCITING PLAYER
[ct=4528.140] AND CAN DO A LOT.
[ct=4530.510] I LIVE WHAT WE DO WITH THE RUN
[ct=4532.591] GAME, AND IT FITS HIS STRENGTHS
[ct=4534.199] WELL BECAUSE IT SETS UP A TON OF
[ct=4537.467] PLAY-ACTION GETS ABOUT THE MOVE.
[ct=4538.726] THAT'S WHEN I THINK HE IS AT THE
[ct=4538.726] BEST.
[ct=4541.685] KIRK: BY THE WAY, WHAT WAS THAT
[ct=4544.481] FIRST GAME LIKE IN 2006 WHEN
[ct=4546.922] THEY CAME BACK, FOR PEOPLE WHO
[ct=4547.719] ARE NOT FROM THIS REGION?
[ct=4552.274] WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?
[ct=4556.921] DREW: THIS VANTAGE POINT,
[ct=4560.683] BLOCKING THE PARK RIGHT THERE, I
[ct=4563.243] HOPE IT DOES NOT HAPPEN TO US
[ct=4563.995] AND IT WAS THE SHOT HEARD AROUND
[ct=4564.440] THE WORLD.
[ct=4567.042] THAT WAS ALMOST THE MOST
[ct=4568.010] INCREDIBLE MOMENT IN SAINTS
[ct=4568.838] HISTORY.
[ct=4577.697] AL: AS I RECALL, STOPPING AT THE
[ct=4579.265] 31-YARD LINE, THAT HAPPENED
[ct=4580.417] EARLY, 1.5 INTO THE
[ct=4583.036] AND THE PLACE JUST EXPLODED.
[ct=4585.688] DREW: I HAVE NEVER HEARD THE
[ct=4586.976] DOME THAT LOUD.
[ct=4589.675] I NEVER HEARD THE DOM
[ct=4590.970] LOUD.
[ct=4594.977] IT MEANT THAT MUCH MORE.
[ct=4596.293] PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO REBUILD
[ct=4597.601] THEIR LIVES, AND SOMEHOW THEY
[ct=4598.937] FIGURED OUT A WAY TO BUY
[ct=4601.574] SEASON TICKETS.
[ct=4603.006] WE DO NOT FEEL IT AS PRESSURE
[ct=4605.567] BUT SPOTS ABILITY.
[ct=4606.903] WE REPRESENTED OUR CITY,
[ct=4608.257] COMMUNITY, AND WE KNEW WE COULD
[ct=4610.908] LIFT YOUR SPIRITS AND
[ct=4612.291] PROCESS BY WINNING FOOTBALL
[ct=4616.258] AL: YOU AND SEAN PAYTON ARE A
[ct=4616.258] MATCH MADE IN FOOTBALL HEAVEN.
[ct=4618.934] SO THEY HONORED YOU AT A
[ct=4620.210] LUNCHEON TODAY, AND SEAN PAYTON
[ct=4621.508] SHOWS UP.
[ct=4624.203] DREW: IN ALL OF HIS BRONCOS
[ct=4626.847] GEAR, HIS BRONCOS HOODIE, ALONG
[ct=4626.847] WITH OTHER COACHES.
[ct=4629.475] 75% OF THE SIDELINE I PLAYED
[ct=4632.209] WITH HAD SOME INTERACTION OVER
[ct=4632.209] THE YEARS.
[ct=4634.808] AL: THE TIGHT END MAKES A CATCH.
[ct=4637.472] HE'S HAD A NICE NIGHT.
[ct=4642.804] KIRK: JIMMY GRAHAM.
[ct=4645.427] DREW: ONE OF THE GREATEST
[ct=4645.427] TEAMMATES EVER.
[ct=4653.385] AL: OF COURSE, REMEMBER -- I
[ct=4656.067] NEVER FORGOT, HE DID A
[ct=4656.067] PRODUCTION MEETING ONCE
[ct=4657.381] SAID, WHAT DOES YOUR WIFE THINK
[ct=4658.737] ABOUT WHEN YOU ARE DOING THIS?
[ct=4661.371] SHE SAID I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.
[ct=4664.015] DREW: YOU HAVE TO GO TO A
[ct=4665.408] DIFFERENT PLACE WHEN YOU ARE
[ct=4665.408] DOWN THERE.
[ct=4669.361] I REMEMBER MATT STARTED IN THE
[ct=4670.743] 2007 SEASON.
[ct=4673.307] IT FELT LIKE SOMETHING WAS
[ct=4674.712] LACKING AND NEEDED TO BE DONE TO
[ct=4677.315] CREATE THE ENERGY AND EXCITEMENT
[ct=4677.315] FOR PREGAME AND LUCID
[ct=4678.714] CONFIDENCE.
[ct=4681.288] -- AND COMPETENCE.
[ct=4683.931] KIRK: BO NIX HAD PLANNED FOR
[ct=4689.291] A LOT OF US WATCHED BEFORE HE
[ct=4690.600] GOT THE PLAY, LOOKED AT HIS
[ct=4693.243] PHYSICAL ABILITY, AND HE
[ct=4694.615] REMINDED ME A LOT OF YOU AS FAR
[ct=4697.245] AS HIS APPROACH TO THE GAME,
[ct=4699.876] ATHLETIC ABILITY, AND HIS
[ct=4701.221] APPROACH AND HOW HE IS A
[ct=4701.221] NO-NONSENSE GUY.
[ct=4703.872] HAVE YOU WATCHED HIM MUCH?
[ct=4706.516] DREW: I WATCHED HIM A WHILE.
[ct=4710.496] I SAW HIM DO A LOT OF THINGS,
[ct=4713.192] AND I KNOW THAT HE IS REQUIRED
[ct=4714.474] IN THE QUARTERBACK POSITION.
[ct=4717.201] BO IS AT HIS BEST ON THE
[ct=4717.201] PERIMETER.
[ct=4721.141] I THINK WHERE HE CAN TAKE
[ct=4722.460] BALANCES IS THROWING FROM THE
[ct=4725.124] BEING ABLE TO GET THE BALL OUT
[ct=4727.784] ON TIME, AVOID PRESSURE, AND
[ct=4731.787] ALSO TO WIN THAT CONFIDENCE
[ct=4734.388] IF HE CAN BE UNDER CENTER A
[ct=4735.791] LITTLE MORE AND TURNED BACK
[ct=4737.108] OFFENSE MORE.
[ct=4739.728] KIRK: GO BACK TO YOUR ROOKIE
[ct=4742.381] YEAR, FOR THE FANS, WATCHING
[ct=4743.713] ROOKIE QUARTERBACKS, JUST THE
[ct=4745.058] SPEED OF THE GAME AND HOW
[ct=4750.363] DIFFERENT IT IS COMPARED TO
[ct=4750.363] YEAR 3, 4 AND FIVE, VERY
[ct=4753.009] DIFFERENT.
[ct=4755.743] YOU HERE.
[ct=4758.318] AL: THEY GET YOU ON A THIRD AND
[ct=4761.000] HE SETS UP A FIRST AND GOAL.
[ct=4763.641] DREW: HE LOOK LIKE JASON HOWELL
[ct=4764.996] WITH THAT.
[ct=4767.609] KIRK: WHAT IS GREAT IS YOU CAN
[ct=4768.962] USE THE FORMATION TO GO TO THE
[ct=4771.607] FIELD, AND THEY ARE ONE AND
[ct=4772.952] SHORT BACK THE OTHER WAY.
[ct=4774.270] DREW: GUY LIKE HIM WITH HIS
[ct=4778.231] ATHLETICISM, HE CAN GIVE YOU
[ct=4778.231] WHAT MOST CANNOT.
[ct=4782.220] THE GAME WILL STEADILY SLOW DOWN
[ct=4784.896] FROM HIM, ESPECIALLY AS IT
[ct=4786.215] PERTAINS TO THE DRAWBACK PASSING
[ct=4787.548] GAME.
[ct=4792.872] THEY DO HAVE SOME BIG TARGETS,
[ct=4795.526] SO YOU CAN GET COMPLETION, PUMP
[ct=4796.836] LAMENT THE RUN GAME AND GET SET
[ct=4799.497] UP FOR MUCH MORE FROM THEIR --
[ct=4800.796] COMPLEMENT THE RUN GAME AND GET
[ct=4802.213] SET UP FOR MUCH MORE FROM THERE.
[ct=4804.782] AL: 79 RUSHING YARDS FOR NIX
[ct=4810.145] HE BURROWS HIS WAY INTO THE
[ct=4814.102] SO THE DENVER BRONCOS, 69 YARDS,
[ct=4815.462] FIVE PLAYS, FOUR ON THE GROUND.
[ct=4819.420] AND THE BRONCO FAITHFUL ARE
[ct=4819.420] HAPPY.
[ct=4822.102] ON THE ROAD.
[ct=4824.717] KIRK: WHAT WE HAVE SEEN
[ct=4826.090] THROUGHOUT THE GAME,
[ct=4827.432] ABILITY TO CONTROL THE LINE OF
[ct=4831.450] IT HAS NOT BEEN SOMETHING THAT
[ct=4832.677] NECESSARILY HAS BEEN A STRENGTH,
[ct=4834.045] BUT TODAY IT HAS BEEN.
[ct=4836.682] GREAT JOB -- LOOK AT THE PUSH UP
[ct=4840.729] FRONT, BACK FROM THAT
[ct=4844.678] JAVONTE WILLIAMS'S SINCE THE
[ct=4844.678] INJURY, AND YOU ARE S
[ct=4846.003] LOOKS GREAT.
[ct=4849.992] AL: RIGHT PROBABLY.
[ct=4852.602] AL: GOING ALL THE WAY BACK, JIM
[ct=4855.285] MOORE KIND OF HELP TO TURN THE
[ct=4855.285] FRANCHISE AROUND.
[ct=4857.947] EVERYBODY WAS WEARING THE BAGS
[ct=4859.328] UNTIL HIM.
[ct=4863.246] THEY HAD SOME REALLY GOOD YEARS,
[ct=4864.607] AND THEN SEAN PAYTON CAME AND
[ct=4864.607] YOU KNOW THE REST.
[ct=4872.560] 26-3, THE BRONCOS ON TOP.
[ct=4877.917] FROM THE FOUR, RUNNING THIS ONE
[ct=4879.198] YOU TALK ABOUT RATTLER.
[ct=4883.179] YOU COVER HIM, HE WAS IN
[ct=4884.510] OKLAHOMA, GOT OFF TO A GOOD
[ct=4887.186] START THERE, THEN HE GOES TO
[ct=4887.186] SOUTH CAROLINA.
[ct=4888.493] THE PASS IS LOW.
[ct=4893.862] HE IS A HEISMAN CANDIDATE,
[ct=4895.168] GOT THE NUMBER ONE DRAFT PICK.
[ct=4896.481] WHAT HAPPENED?
[ct=4900.443] KIRK: I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IS
[ct=4901.892] CALEB WILLIAMS EMERGED AND
[ct=4903.081] BECAME CALEB WILLIAMS.
[ct=4908.448] EVENTUALLY, IT TOOK A GUY,
[ct=4908.448] BEFORE THAT HAPPENED, HE WAS A
[ct=4911.105] HEISMAN FRONT RUNNER AND WAS
[ct=4912.395] GETTING BOOED OFF THE FIELD IN
[ct=4913.713] HIS OWN STADIUM.
[ct=4916.406] AND HE ENDED UP LOSING THE JOB.
[ct=4919.013] CALEB WILLIAMS WENT ON TO HAVE A
[ct=4921.682] GOOD YEAR, AND HE SAT THROUGH
[ct=4924.350] THAT YEAR, AND THEN AFTER THE
[ct=4925.684] SEASON, HE LEFT TO COLUMBIA
[ct=4929.683] HAD TWO GOOD YEARS AT SOUTH
[ct=4929.683] CAROLINA.
[ct=4933.620] IN THIS STAGE OF PORTAL, HE IS
[ct=4936.321] STAYING AND GREW.
[ct=4940.297] AND I THINK NOW HE GETS INTO THE
[ct=4944.299] NFL, AND HE IS GOING TO SIT
[ct=4946.903] BEHIND DEREK CARR, WHO IS BACK,
[ct=4948.254] WHICH IS GOOD FOR HIM, BUT I
[ct=4949.576] THINK THIS EXPERIENCE IS HU
[ct=4950.885] FOR HIS BROTHER.
[ct=4953.579] AL: WE TALKED ABOUT GETTING
[ct=4954.888] BOOED OFF THE FIELD.
[ct=4959.017] YOU KNOW, IN A WAY, YOU TALK
[ct=4962.892] ABOUT NIX AT AUBURN, THAT DID
[ct=4962.892] NOT END WONDERFULLY.
[ct=4965.510] KIRK: GARY SIMILARLY.
[ct=4966.840] -- VERY SIMILARLY.
[ct=4969.502] BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE GREW UP IN
[ct=4972.221] ALABAMA, HIS DAD WAS A GREAT
[ct=4973.486] QUARTERBACK THERE, AND NOW
[ct=4974.932] GREAT HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL
[ct=4974.932] COACH.
[ct=4977.533] THIS KID, FROM THE TIME HE
[ct=4978.978] TWO OR THREE HAD NOTHING BUT
[ct=4978.978] AUBURN JERSEYS.
[ct=4981.525] HE LIVED OUT HIS DREAM TO GO TO
[ct=4982.924] AUBURN, PLAY QUARTERBACK.
[ct=4986.834] AFTER HIS FIRST YEAR, I THINK
[ct=4989.481] THEY WERE 6-5, NOT GREAT, AND
[ct=4991.543] THEY BOOED HIM.
[ct=4994.812] SO HE LEFT, WENT OUT TO
[ct=4996.115] SO THEY BOTH HAD A SIMILAR PATH
[ct=4998.795] AS FAR AS GETTING ADVERSITY,
[ct=5001.445] WHICH AS I SAID, A LOT OF THESE
[ct=5002.796] NFL EXECUTIVES LIKE TO FIND
[ct=5005.458] QUARTERBACKS THAT ARE NOT
[ct=5008.090] PERFECT, THAT THEY HAVE BEEN
[ct=5008.090] THROUGH SOME STUFF BECAUSE IT
[ct=5009.416] WILL OBVIOUSLY
[ct=5010.771] APPEARED TO THE NFL.
[ct=5013.397] AL: THAT WAS TIPTON ACHING THAT
[ct=5016.098] CATCH, EIGHT YARD GAIN -- MAKING
[ct=5017.416] THAT CATCH, EIGHT YARD GAIN.
[ct=5021.369] HE IS IN THE TRIPLE DIGITS RIGHT
[ct=5022.710] NOW, AND A NICE RUN RIGHT HERE
[ct=5024.011] FOR WILLIAMS.
[ct=5025.369] BACKUP.
[ct=5029.342] WILLIAMS CAME OVER AS A FREE
[ct=5033.309] AGENT AND HAD A 1000 YARD SEASON
[ct=5034.713] AS A LION.
[ct=5037.307] KIRK: WITH KENDRE MILLER BEHIND
[ct=5041.300] HIM, HE IS NOT GETTING A TON OF
[ct=5042.631] CARRIES, BUT HE GOT THAT ONE.
[ct=5046.631] AL: AND 17 TOUCHDOWNS WITH THE
[ct=5047.919] LIONS COUPLE OF YEARS BACK.
[ct=5050.610] RATTLER WILL SLIDE TO ESTOP.
[ct=5054.639] 3:50 REMAINING IN THE THIRD.
[ct=5058.597] BRONCOS HAVE THINGS AT THIS
[ct=5058.597] POINT WELL IN HAND.
[ct=5065.208] TIGHT END, AND WE GO TO KAYLEE.
[ct=5069.186] KAYLEE: ADD ANOTHER INJURY FOR
[ct=5071.828] THE SAINTS OFFENSIVE LINE, NICK
[ct=5074.473] SALDIVERI IS OUT WITH A SHOULDER
[ct=5074.473] INJURY.
[ct=5078.496] HE WAS A BACKUP FOR STARTER
[ct=5079.796] BECAUSE OF OTHER INJURIES, AND
[ct=5079.796] NOW IT
[ct=5081.159] HIS SPOT.
[ct=5083.781] AL: A ROOKIE OUT OF BOSTON
[ct=5083.781] COLLEGE.
[ct=5093.088] AND THE IT IS THAT KIND OF BACK
[ct=5094.383] FOR THE SAINTS AT THIS POINT.
[ct=5098.363] KIRK: NOW LANDON YOUNG, THE
[ct=5101.118] RIGHT GUARD, WHO WAS A BACKUP,
[ct=5102.368] HE IS A TACKLE THAT THEY MOVED
[ct=5103.721] THE GUARD.
[ct=5109.042] THAT IS WHERE THEY ARE.
[ct=5111.684] THEY HAD TO MOVE A TACKLE IN AT
[ct=5113.022] GUARD.
[ct=5115.733] AL: THAT IS ALL IT TAKES.
[ct=5123.636] SO IT IS FIRST AND 25, SO THE
[ct=5125.012] SEASON THAT STARTED SO
[ct=5127.632] PROMISINGLY FOR THE SAINTS, THAT
[ct=5127.632] COMING OFF THE RAILS.
[ct=5130.410] TWO BLOWOUT WINS TO GET THINGS
[ct=5130.410] STARTED.
[ct=5132.971] TIGHT GAME WITH PHILLY, THEY
[ct=5134.282] LOST IT.
[ct=5136.919] NOW ON THE VERGE OF GOING DOWN
[ct=5136.919] FOR THE FIFTH CONSECUTIVE GAME.
[ct=5140.963] CATCHES AT THE 43 BY MASON
[ct=5143.601] TIPTON, THE ROOKIE OUT OF
[ct=5148.895] YALE.
[ct=5151.557] NOT THE ONE IN TOWN, THE KEY
[ct=5152.882] COMPANY.
[ct=5154.168] I'M FINDING THIS AMUSING.
[ct=5159.512] SECOND AND 18.
[ct=5163.511] DATA CENTRIC WILSON.
[ct=5166.125] -- THAT IS CEDRIC WILSON.
[ct=5168.760] KIRK: ANYTIME YOU SEE A HELMET
[ct=5170.106] ON THE GROUND, HANDS
[ct=5171.439] OF THE OFFENSE.
[ct=5174.098] >> LEGAL HANDS TO THE FACE.
[ct=5174.098] NUMBER 60.
[ct=5176.758] AL:.
[ct=5176.758] GOOD.
[ct=5180.730] KIRK: IT IS LIKE REGISTERED
[ct=5183.401] KAYLEE TALK ABOUT KYLE HERGEL
[ct=5187.409] COMING IN, THE UNDRAFTED ROOKIE
[ct=5188.689] AGENT OUT OF BOSTON COLLEGE.
[ct=5191.404] HE GETS INTO THE GAME, HE GETS
[ct=5194.044] HIS HANDS OF PION D.J. JONES --
[ct=5195.415] ACTUALLY THAT IS MALCOLM ROACH,
[ct=5195.415] A FORMER SAINT.
[ct=5198.007] IT IS LIKE THE SAINTS FANS HAVE
[ct=5198.007] SEEN ENOUGH.
[ct=5203.307] AL: NOT QUITE
[ct=5204.691] THOUGH.
[ct=5205.995] KIRK: NOW.
[ct=5207.278] AL: SECOND AND 28.
[ct=5213.974] DOWN HE GOES.
[ct=5213.974] FINALLY, THEY GET TO HIM.
[ct=5217.943] JOHN FRANKLIN-MYERS GETS THE
[ct=5219.285] SACK HERE.
[ct=5223.237] KIRK: AGAIN, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF
[ct=5225.905] LANDON YOUNG, THE RIGHT GUARD
[ct=5227.204] RIGHT HERE WHO IS A TACKLE,
[ct=5228.597] TRYING TO FIT IN TO BE A GUARD.
[ct=5232.543] FRANKLIN-MYERS, WHO THEY BROUGHT
[ct=5236.509] OVER FROM THE JETS, 6'4", 290.
[ct=5239.161] HE HAD WELCOME BROOCH, YOU JUST
[ct=5240.537] TALKED ABOUT, YOU ADD THOSE TWO
[ct=5243.181] WITH ZACH ALLEN AND D.J. JONES,
[ct=5244.530] SUCH A DIFFERENT DEFENSE THIS
[ct=5245.873] YEAR BECAUSE OF THE PUSH THEY
[ct=5248.489] ARE NOW GETTING IN THE MIDDLE TO
[ct=5249.830] COMPLEMENT COOPER, ELLIS,
[ct=5251.128] BONITTO, AND BROWNING OUT ON THE
[ct=5251.128] EDGE.
[ct=5253.892] AL: WHAT IS ON YOUR PLACE YOU
[ct=5256.495] GET 30, 34?
[ct=5260.502] DECENT GAME, BREAKING TACKLES,
[ct=5263.086] UP TO THE 41-YARD LINE
[ct=5264.456] ROOKIE OUT OF PITTSBURGH.
[ct=5268.416] AND LIKE RATTLER, HE WAS DRAFTED
[ct=5268.416] IN THE FIFTH ROUND.
[ct=5269.749] THEY HAD A COUPLE OF CHOICES.
[ct=5272.413] HE JUST SAW THE CHEMISTRY
[ct=5272.413] BETWEEN THEM.
[ct=5273.700] FOURTH DOWN IN 20.
[ct=5277.703] -- AND 20.
[ct=5281.761] AND THERE WILL BE THE FIFTH PUNT
[ct=5283.047] OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=5288.376] SAINTS, MEANWHILE, THEY HAVE
[ct=5290.982] THEIR THURSDAY NIGHT GAME AND

[ct=5312.234] AND EIGHT FLAG.
[ct=5314.890] LINE OF SCRIMMAGE -- AND BY A
[ct=5316.217] LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=5318.887] KIRK: SINCE THAT SECOND LAST
[ct=5321.492] WEEK AGAINST TAMPA WERE THEY
[ct=5322.887] SCORED 27 POINTS, SINCE THEN,
[ct=5326.837] THEY HAVE BEEN OUTSCORED 53-3,
[ct=5326.837] SECOND HALF, LAST WEEK.
[ct=5329.475] WHAT WE HAVE SEEN THESE FIRST
[ct=5329.475] THREE QUARTERS.
[ct=5330.818] AL: YOU TALK ABOUT A GOOD
[ct=5332.201] TEAMMATE, AND WE TALKED TO
[ct=5334.809] RATTLER ABOUT DEREK CARR --
[ct=5337.474] >> NUMBER 48 WAS LINED UP I
[ct=5342.813] AL: THAT IS NOT ALWAYS HAPPEN.
[ct=5348.106] WITH A GUY LIKE CARR NUMBER, NUM
[ct=5353.399] SO NIX HAS DONE A REALLY GOOD
[ct=5353.399] JOB TONIGHT.
[ct=5360.053] 50-24, 161, 75 ON THE GROUND.
[ct=5362.756] FLAG.

[ct=5375.985] KIRK: JAVONTE WILLIAMS PICK IT
[ct=5377.294] UP AND PASS, AND I HAVE TO HOLD.
[ct=5380.021] HE'S ONE OF THE BETTER PASS
[ct=5381.355] PROTECTING RUNS IN THE LEAGUE
[ct=5382.745] HE GOT CAUGHT THERE.
[ct=5386.705] >> HOLDING, OFFENSE.

[ct=5389.288] AL: INDEED, WILLIAMS.
[ct=5391.941] NOW WE GO ONCE MORE TO KAYLEE.

[ct=5395.875] WEEKEND FOR THE NIX FAMILY.
[ct=5399.901] BO'S MOM IS HERE TONIGHT, BUT
[ct=5401.220] HIS DAD, PATRICK, IS WATCHING

[ct=5411.831] OF HER BOY.
[ct=5413.226] FIRST AND 20.

[ct=5417.194] FLOOR MCLAUGHLIN.
[ct=5422.476] HE'S APPROACHING AND HAS
[ct=5425.154] EXCEEDED 200 YARDS ON THE
[ct=5426.462] GROUND, 206.
[ct=5431.809] KIRK: THE OFFENSE OF LINE ARMS A
[ct=5433.109] LOT OF CREDIT.
[ct=5434.402] SEAN PAYTON REAL WITH WHAT HE'S
[ct=5435.750] SEEN FROM THE BIG BOYS UP FRONT.
[ct=5438.390] AL: ANYTHING
[ct=5438.390] WITH THAT BABY TONIGHT.
[ct=5446.381] MORE WITH OUR LOCAL ASTRONOMER
[ct=5446.381] IN A MOMENT.
[ct=5455.807] KAYLEE: IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT,
[ct=5458.341] THE INJURY BUG JUST RELENTLESS
[ct=5462.327] ON THE SAINTS SIDELINE.
[ct=5463.672] SEAN LATTIMORE, AFTER A VISIT TO
[ct=5466.334] THE MEDICAL TEAM HAS BEEN PULLED
[ct=5466.334] OUT OF THIS GAME BECAUSE
[ct=5467.637] HAMSTRING INJURY.
[ct=5470.294] HE SAT OUT TWO BECAUSE OF A
[ct=5470.294] HAMSTRING INJURY AS WELL.
[ct=5473.051] AN UPDATE ON THE OTHER
[ct=5474.361] QUARTERBACK, YOU SAW HIM IN THAT
[ct=5476.979] VACUUM SPLINT ON HIS RIGHT LEG.
[ct=5484.025] HE WENT TO THE AMBULANCE AND NOW
[ct=5485.447] HERE.
[ct=5489.410] AL: OUR BEST TO HIM.
[ct=5494.758] THEY LOST BOTH CORNERS, WE
[ct=5496.011] TALKED ABOUT ALL THE GUYS
[ct=5497.463] MISSING ON THE BENCH.
[ct=5500.040] THEY'VE GOT THREE EXTRA DAYS TO
[ct=5501.412] HEAL UP, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
[ct=5502.717] AGAINST THE CHARGERS.
[ct=5504.020] MEANWHILE YOU'VE GOT A FOURTH
[ct=5505.391] DOWN HERE.
[ct=5508.057] FIRST DRIVE, THIS WAS THEIR
[ct=5512.015] EIGHTH DRIVE OF THE NIGHT AND IS
[ct=5512.015] NOT BEEN AT ONE POIN
[ct=5513.336] TERRITORY.
[ct=5517.310] KIRK: NOBODY HAS BEEN HIT LIKE
[ct=5517.310] THE SAINTS THIS YEAR.
[ct=5522.665] AL: THEY HAVE SOME COMPANY BUT
[ct=5524.144] THEY MIGHT BE NUMBER ONE IN THE
[ct=5525.346] CATEGORY.
[ct=5529.303] RILEY DIXON.
[ct=5538.738] FAIR CAUGHT AT THE 24 YARD LINE.
[ct=5541.241] A MINUTE AND A HALF INTO THE
[ct=5541.241] FOURTH QUARTER, IN NEW ORLEANS,
[ct=5545.207] 26-3 DENVER.
[ct=5550.687] KIRK: LET'S LOOK AT
[ct=5551.866] RELIABILITY REPORT PRESENTED BY
[ct=5553.211] XFINITY INTERNET.
[ct=5555.829] MOST RELIABLE HAS BEEN JAVONTE
[ct=5562.492] WILLIAMS, LOOK AT THAT HOLE
[ct=5566.446] HE IS HAVING A GREAT NIGHT.
[ct=5567.795] A COUPLE OF TOUCHDOWNS, FIRST
[ct=5570.404] TIME IN HIS CAREER HE'S BEEN
[ct=5570.404] ABLE TO GET A COUPLE OF SCORES.
[ct=5574.428] A LOT OF TALK ABOUT BO NIX BUT
[ct=5575.773] TO ME IT'S BEEN ABOUT WILLIAMS
[ct=5578.412] AND THE OFFENSE OF LINE AND THE
[ct=5579.727] RUN GAME TONIGHT.
[ct=5585.137] AL: THE PASS HERE
[ct=5589.044] LEVI WALLACE.
[ct=5593.007] KIRK: THIS DEFENSE ARE PLAYING
[ct=5594.325] WELL TONIGHT AGAINST THE SAINTS
[ct=5594.325] OFFENSE THAT'S BEAT UP.
[ct=5602.312] THIS DEFENSE, YOU CAN’
[ct=5603.664] THIS DEFENSE, YOU CAN'T LLAMA
[ct=5605.029] NOT OF -- LOT OF THEM.
[ct=5606.296] THEY HAVE PLAYED WELL TOGETHER
[ct=5606.296] AS A UNIT.
[ct=5611.637] AL: VANCE JOSEPH HAS DONE A NICE
[ct=5614.264] JOB, HE WAS THE HEAD COACH AT
[ct=5615.591] DENVER, THEN HE WENT TO ARIZONA
[ct=5616.900] AS THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR.
[ct=5618.242] THEN WHEN SEAN GOT THE JOB, HE
[ct=5619.588] BROUGHT HIM BACK.
[ct=5623.584] KIRK: HE IS A STUD.
[ct=5627.555] HE HAS RILEY MOSS ON ONE CORNER
[ct=5628.872] OPPOSITE SEARCH AND.
[ct=5635.604] -- AL: HE'S KIND OF LIKE HAD A
[ct=5638.219] LOT OF THE SAME PATH THAT RAHEEM
[ct=5639.583] MORRIS HAD.
[ct=5640.881] HAD NOT BEEN A HEAD COACH,
[ct=5644.862] GAMING D.C., HE’
[ct=5646.205] GAMING D.C., HE'S GOT ATLANTA
[ct=5647.554] PLAYING VERY WELL RIGHT NOW.
[ct=5648.921] PASS TO THE OUTSIDE IS CAUGHT BY
[ct=5651.542] MEANS, THE ROOKIE MAKES HIS
[ct=5652.871] SECOND GRAB.
[ct=5655.646] KIRK: IT REALLY SHOWS YOU THE
[ct=5659.656] WAY THIS DEFENSE CAN BECOME
[ct=5659.656] SOMETHING ELSE.
[ct=5662.284] TONIGHT THEY HAVE PLAYED
[ct=5663.600] PREDOMINANTLY IN THE ZONE.
[ct=5664.878] BECAUSE THEY ARE PLAYING AGAINST
[ct=5666.228] THIS YOUNG QUARTERBACK, THEY
[ct=5670.193] COMPLETELY CHANGE THE LOOK,
[ct=5670.193] PLAYING WAY MORE ZONE AND
[ct=5671.539] BLITZING.
[ct=5675.533] AL: HERE COMES THE SACK HERE.
[ct=5686.750] KIRK: AND THEN BAILED AT THE
[ct=5687.952] LAST SECOND TO CREATE A LITTLE
[ct=5688.345] CONFUSION FOR THE ROOKIE LEFT
[ct=5693.294] ALLOWED BONITTO TO COME AROUND
[ct=5696.826] AL: FIVE STRAIGHT GAMES NOW WITH
[ct=5698.198] THE SACK FOR BONITTO.
[ct=5704.172] THE BRONCOS ARE GOING TO TRY TO
[ct=5705.548] RATCHETED UP AND WIN TONIGHT.
[ct=5706.812] CAROLINA IN DENVER NEXT WEEK.
[ct=5712.726] THE SCHEDULE MAKERS DID NOT DO
[ct=5714.017] THEM ANY FAVORS.
[ct=5715.371] AT BALTIMORE, AND THEN AT KANSAS
[ct=5715.602] CITY, BACK TO BACK.
[ct=5718.413] KIRK: THAT'S TOUGH.
[ct=5722.667] THE AFC, KANSAS CITY IS GOING TO
[ct=5723.419] WIN THAT DIVISION MORE THAN
[ct=5723.811] LIKELY.
[ct=5726.840] YOU'VE GOT A SHOT AT THAT
[ct=5727.644] WILDCARD.
[ct=5732.559] AL: SEVEN TEAMS IN EACH
[ct=5733.609] CONFERENCE GOING IN.
[ct=5734.056] ANOTHER SACK HERE.
[ct=5741.211] THIS NOT OF MISERY IN A WAY WILL
[ct=5741.432] CONTINUE.
[ct=5742.195] ANOTHER SACK HERE, THIS TIME
[ct=5745.529] ZACH ALLEN, CAME OVER FROM
[ct=5747.641] ARIZONA.
[ct=5751.537] FOUR SACKS TONIGHT FOR THE
[ct=5751.789] BRONCOS.
[ct=5755.215] KIRK: HE IS RELENTLESS.
[ct=5759.040] A GREAT PLAYER.
[ct=5762.777] AL: THE BRONCOS CAME INTO THE
[ct=5764.625] GAME SECOND IN THE LEAGUE IN
[ct=5764.625] SACKS.
[ct=5767.355] 22, THEY ARE NOW AT 26.

[ct=5781.698] DRIFTING, MAKING THE FAIR CATCH
[ct=5783.038] AT THE 15.
[ct=5786.979] 10:34 LEFT IN REGULATION.
[ct=5790.302] STORY OF THE NIGHT IF YOU ARE A
[ct=5791.771] SAINTS FAN, RIGHT THERE. LOOK AT
[ct=5793.395] NEXGEN STATS, POWERED BY AWS.
[ct=5796.392] YARDS BEFORE CONTACT TELLS YOU
[ct=5797.236] THE JOB THE OFFENSE OF LINE HAS
[ct=5797.500] DONE.
[ct=5802.430] 114 YARDS AFTER CONTACT, KIND OF
[ct=5803.731] EXPECTED THAT WAS SOME OF THE
[ct=5805.002] SAINTS TACKLING.
[ct=5807.563] AND PLUS 40 RUNS YARDS OVER
[ct=5808.345] EXPECTED.
[ct=5808.922] ALL THREE OF THOSE ARE SEASON
[ct=5815.797] HIGHS AND THE BENEFICIARY IS BO
[ct=5816.049] NIX AND THE OFFENSE TONIGHT.
[ct=5821.632] AL: DENVER HAS 372 TOTAL YARDS.
[ct=5825.691] THE SAINTS DEFENSE POROUS AGAIN,
[ct=5826.990] SHREDDED FOR ALMOST 600 YARDS
[ct=5828.328] TOTAL LAST WEEK.
[ct=5829.343] TO THE OUTSIDE, AROUND THE
[ct=5829.343] CORNER.
[ct=5832.577] WE’
[ct=5834.527] WE'LL CHALK UP ANOTHER 15 OR 16.
[ct=5840.643] KIRK: YOU ALWAYS WONDER IF THEY
[ct=5840.643] HAD A HOLD ON THE EDGE THERE.
[ct=5855.697] AL: THAT SAINTS DEFENSE IS GOING
[ct=5860.411] -- 51 POINTS LAST WEEK, ONLY
[ct=5862.591] HALF OF THAT TONIGHT.
[ct=5866.863] BUT ALMOST 400 YARDS OF OFFENSE.
[ct=5874.695] >> NUMBER 79 IS ELIGIBLE.
[ct=5879.147] AL: MEANWHILE DENVER HAS NOT
[ct=5880.643] EVEN BEEN TARGETED.
[ct=5886.977] YOU WOULD THINK THAT REALLY
[ct=5887.423] WOULD HAVE NEEDED HIM.
[ct=5890.060] FINALLY THERE ABLE TO SMOTHER
[ct=5891.664] WILLEMS IN THE BACK FIELD.
[ct=5895.624] SECOND DOWN AND 19.
[ct=5899.513] KIRK: JUST A MISCOMMUNICATION IN
[ct=5902.493] THE INTERIOR MADE IT EASY FOR
[ct=5906.770] ORJI TO GET IN THERE.
[ct=5908.267] DENVER HAS NOT GOTTEN BEHIND THE
[ct=5910.630] STICKS MUCH TONIGHT WITH
[ct=5911.519] PENALTIES AND MISCUES.
[ct=5912.310] IT'S BEEN A PRETTY CLEAN GAME.
[ct=5919.858] AL: THEY WANTED TO RUN IT AND
[ct=5921.794] THEY HAVE DONE THAT IN DEED.
[ct=5924.378] 31 RUNS, ONLY 25 PASS PLAYS.
[ct=5932.002] NOT DOWN AT THE LINE OF
[ct=5933.657] IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 19.
[ct=5936.657] KIRK: YOU LOOK AT THIS TEAM AND
[ct=5936.965] WHO THEY HAVE COMING UP, YOU
[ct=5940.359] MENTIONED KANSAS CITY AND
[ct=5940.788] BALTIMORE OUT OF THAT CAROLINA
[ct=5943.925] WITH THE DEFENSE AND THE SPECIAL
[ct=5946.656] TEAMS THEY PLAY, I THINK SEAN
[ct=5948.876] PAYTON IS CONFIDENT THEY CAN BE
[ct=5950.148] COMPETITIVE IN A LOT OF THESE
[ct=5951.612] JUST A MATTER OF CAN THEY
[ct=5954.457] CONTINUE TO DO THIS, TO GEL AND
[ct=5956.696] DEVELOP UPFRONT WITH THE
[ct=5957.145] CONTINUITY OF THAT OFFENSE OF
[ct=5959.035] LINE AND WHAT THEY HAVE COMING
[ct=5962.705] JAVONTE WILLIAMS, CAN HE STAY
[ct=5963.085] HEALTHY AND RUN THIS FOOTBALL?
[ct=5966.800] BO NIX, WE KNOW HE'S JUST GOING
[ct=5968.350] TO GET BETTER EVERY SINGLE WEEK.
[ct=5971.775] AL: THIRD AND 19.
[ct=5976.088] OUT TO THE 16 YARD LINE GOES
[ct=5977.264] JAVONTE WILLIAMS AS HE HONES IN
[ct=5977.683] ON 100 YARDS TONIGHT.
[ct=5980.325] 91 ON THE GROUND FOR HIM.
[ct=5985.776] RILEY DIXON WILL COME IN.
[ct=5986.342] IT'S BEEN AN OFF NIGHT FOR HIM.
[ct=5990.191] HE'S AVERAGING SIX PINTS AGAIN.
[ct=5993.039] THIS WILL ONLY BE HIS THIRD --
[ct=5995.903] SIX PUNTS A GAME.
[ct=6000.738] THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS AND YOU
[ct=6001.691] DON'T CONVERT VERY OFTEN ON
[ct=6010.138] THEY HAVE DONE ENOUGH OF A JOB
[ct=6010.138] TO KEEP HIM ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=6016.873] 39 YARD LINE.
[ct=6021.000] JACKSON, STARTS ONE WAY, GOES
[ct=6021.239] THE OTHER.
[ct=6023.898] FORCED OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=6029.438] KIRK: CONNOR MCDAVID, MAYBE THE
[ct=6029.691] BEST EVER.
[ct=6032.358] AL: WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY
[ct=6035.029] PAL WAYNE GRETZKY, HE IS RIGHT
[ct=6042.344] MEANWHILE WE TALK ABOUT DEREK
[ct=6046.759] CARR, MISSING HIS SECOND
[ct=6048.096] STRAIGHT GAME.
[ct=6048.714] I KNOW HE'D LIKE TO PLATE NEXT
[ct=6050.693] THEY ARE NOT SURE OF THAT,
[ct=6051.374] PROBABLY THE FOLLOWING WEEK.
[ct=6054.790] THEY WERE SAYING HIS WHOLE
[ct=6056.000] CAREER HAS BEEN WITH THE
[ct=6057.753] RAIDERS, COMES OVER HERE.
[ct=6058.990] THE CATCH IS MADE BY JOHNSON.
[ct=6064.773] KIRK: TALKED TO HIM ON THE FIELD
[ct=6064.773] BEFORE THE GAME.
[ct=6072.360] EVERY TIME AT THIS POINT OF HIS
[ct=6072.942] REHAB, EVERY TIME HE TRIES TO
[ct=6074.705] THURN -- TURN AND PRO, THAT
[ct=6079.164] THROWING MOTION ON THE FIELD,
[ct=6080.393] CONTINUING TO DOUBLE DOWN.
[ct=6080.877] HE'S DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN TO
[ct=6081.291] GET BACK.
[ct=6088.506] AL: INCOMPLETE, COVERED ON
[ct=6089.971] PLAY BY RILEY MOSS.
[ct=6090.246] FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=6096.915] 7:31 ON THE CLOCK IN THE FOURTH.
[ct=6102.295] I WONDER IF HE CAME WITH AT SIGN
[ct=6103.298] ALREADY MADE.
[ct=6106.616] KIRK: IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS
[ct=6107.022] ALREADY PREPARED.
[ct=6109.052] AL: VERY PROFESSIONAL.
[ct=6114.380] KIRK: HE IS ANTICIPATING THIS.
[ct=6119.841] AL: RATTLER, A LITTLE SHOVEL
[ct=6124.025] DUMP TO ALVIN KAMARA AND THEY
[ct=6125.247] TURNED THE BALL OVER ON DOWNS.
[ct=6129.604] 7:25 REMAINING.
[ct=6134.152] AND WE WILL BE BACK.
[ct=6136.557] I PROMISE.
[ct=6143.742] AL: THURSDAY NIGHT NEXT WEEK,
[ct=6144.573] LOS ANGELES, THE RAMS WILL PLAY
[ct=6146.202] THE RAIDERS ON SUNDAY.
[ct=6150.542] VIKINGS WILL PLAY THE LIONS ON
[ct=6152.436] SUNDAY AND THEY GO INTO THAT
[ct=6153.178] GAME UNBEATEN.
[ct=6156.119] MATTHEW STAFFORD WITH THE RAMS.
[ct=6158.795] NEXT WEEK.
[ct=6161.660] KIRK: BACK IN THE SADDLE.
[ct=6166.930] AL: WE FELL OFF THE HORSE
[ct=6175.490] KIRK: THIS IS PAYBACK.
[ct=6179.810] AL: 15 YARD GAIN CARRY
[ct=6180.901] ESTIMATE.
[ct=6183.642] MEANWHILE WE HAVE BO NIX, HE AND
[ct=6184.190] SEAN PAYTON THE SIDELINES.
[ct=6190.311] KIRK: WHAT I LOVE IS SEAN
[ct=6192.148] PAYTON, WHEN HE TALKED TO US, HE
[ct=6193.130] SAID THAT'S MY LOVE LANGUAGE.
[ct=6196.040] HE LIKED SEEING HIS ROOKIE
[ct=6198.878] QUARTERBACK GETTING A LITTLE
[ct=6199.181] FEISTY THERE.
[ct=6202.197] WAS THAT THE GAME AFTER THE GAME
[ct=6203.550] HE SAID FERRIS BUEHLER?
[ct=6207.555] AL: I THINK THAT WAS IT, HE SAID
[ct=6209.858] HE REMINDED HIM OF FERRIS
[ct=6210.118] BUEHLER ON HIS DAY OFF.
[ct=6213.537] KIRK: I NEVER SAW HIM LIKE THAT.
[ct=6216.653] AL: NO, NEVER.
[ct=6219.961] FERRIS WAS PRETTY CHILL.
[ct=6247.540] >> INELIGIBLE PLAYER DOWNFIELD.
[ct=6249.458] FIVE YARD PENALTY, REPLAY FIRST
[ct=6254.060] KAYLEE: BO NIX HAS ALWAYS WANTED
[ct=6257.543] TO BE COACH HARD, ACCORDING TO
[ct=6257.543] HIS DAD, PATRICK.
[ct=6261.259] PATRICK TOLD ME FROM THE TIME BO
[ct=6263.506] WAS FOUR YEARS OKLAHOMA WHETHER
[ct=6265.569] HE WAS PLAYING T-BALL OR FLAG
[ct=6266.550] FOOTBALL, HE WAS THERE TO
[ct=6266.973] COMPETE AND WIN.
[ct=6269.656] FROM HIS FIRST MEETING WITH SEAN
[ct=6273.134] PAYTON, BO SAID THEY WOULD BE A
[ct=6274.709] GOOD FIT.
[ct=6277.207] HE NEEDS SOMEONE TO BE A LITTLE
[ct=6278.766] FIERY WITH HIM BECAUSE THAT'S
[ct=6279.000] HIS PERSONALITY.
[ct=6283.319] FIRST AND 15 NOW AFTER THAT
[ct=6284.704] PENALTY.
[ct=6290.046] THE SAINTS HAVE IT.
[ct=6301.940] RECOVERED WITH 6:10 REMAINING IN
[ct=6302.993] THE FOURTH.
[ct=6307.896] KIRK: HE GOT THAT BALL OUT
[ct=6309.513] BEFORE HE HIT THE SURFACE.
[ct=6314.715] YOU LOVE TO SEE GUYS STILL
[ct=6315.496] COMPETE WITH THIS GAME WELL OUT
[ct=6315.889] OF REACH.
[ct=6320.256] ESTIMATE IS A GUY TRYING TO GET
[ct=6324.829] MORE CARRIES, TRYING TO IMPROVE.
[ct=6328.356] WERE TALKING ABOUT FRANKLIN AND
[ct=6334.417] VELE AND ESTIME.
[ct=6336.643] HE GETS A FEW CARRIES.
[ct=6339.894] AL: FIVE CARRIES FOR HIM
[ct=6343.875] MEANWHILE THE SAINTS WHO HAVE
[ct=6345.219] HAD TERRIBLE FIELD POSITION ALL
[ct=6348.295] NIGHT, COVERAGES GOOD.
[ct=6351.529] DOWN GOES KENDRE MILLER FOR A
[ct=6352.007] LOSS.
[ct=6357.657] KIRK: I FEEL LIKE YOU WATCH NFL,
[ct=6357.982] YOU WATCH SEVEN OR EIGHT GAMES A
[ct=6361.397] WEEK, DENVER IS JUST SOUND.
[ct=6366.413] VANCE JOKES THAT WHAT HE HAS TO
[ct=6367.218] LOVE ABOUT THIS GROUP IS THEY
[ct=6369.285] ARE JUST IN THE RIGHT SPOT AND
[ct=6369.869] THAT PLAY WELL AS A UNIT.
[ct=6373.985] THEY LEVERAGE THE FOOTBALL,
[ct=6373.985] THERE'S TWO GUYS THERE.
[ct=6379.357] AL: NUMBER 55, THEY PICKED HIM
[ct=6381.041] UP FROM WASHINGTON.
[ct=6387.229] KIRK: STRNAD HAS DONE A GREAT
[ct=6388.276] JOB SINCE HE HAS BEEN IN THERE,
[ct=6389.311] VERY PRODUCTIVE.
[ct=6393.029] AL: THIRD AND NINE.
[ct=6398.971] THE TACKLE IS MADE BOUGHT MOST,
[ct=6400.059] SAVING THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=6401.272] WILSON MAKES THE GROUND.
[ct=6403.628] IT WILL BE FOURTH AND 2.
[ct=6406.073] KIRK: MOSS IN HIS SECOND YEAR
[ct=6408.048] OUT OF IOWA.
[ct=6410.837] A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT GUYS, HE
[ct=6414.195] HAS REALLY EMERGED TO BECOME A
[ct=6414.195] TIGHT CORNER ON THAT SIDE.
[ct=6417.294] AL: THAT WILL CONVERT AS WILSON
[ct=6419.861] MAKES THAT CATCH FOR A FIRST
[ct=6433.301] SAINTS WERE SHUT OUT OF THE LAST
[ct=6434.054] TWO QUARTERS LAST WEEK.
[ct=6440.041] ONE FIELD GOAL, RATTLER STOPPED
[ct=6442.785] AT THE 34 YARD LINE.
[ct=6446.771] KIRK: THE OTHER THING THEY'RE
[ct=6447.745] ABLE TO DO IS ROTATE A LOT OF
[ct=6452.173] BODIES, ESPECIALLY ON THAT EDGE.
[ct=6457.814] THESE OUTSIDE LINEBACKERS AL:.
[ct=6458.044] SECOND, LOOK OUT.
[ct=6461.152] IS THAT GOING TO BE A
[ct=6462.484] THAT IS TAKEN BY BARTON IN THE
[ct=6462.484] AIR?
[ct=6464.587] THERE IS NO WHISTLE YET.
[ct=6473.161] BARTON -- THE BALL IS BEING
[ct=6475.799] RELEASED FOR THE MOMENT.
[ct=6477.164] RULED A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=6481.138] KIRK: IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER
[ct=6482.445] IT'S A FUMBLE OR AN
[ct=6483.822] INTERCEPTION, HE CAUGHT THAT IN
[ct=6483.822] THE AIR.
[ct=6486.569] MCMILLAN CAME COME THEY HAVE NOT
[ct=6487.829] BLITZED A TIME.
[ct=6488.829] THIS TIME THEY DIAL IT UP.
[ct=6492.398] THEY BROUGHT BOTH THE LINEBACKER
[ct=6496.414] AND ALSO MCMILLAN.
[ct=6497.713] SEE HIM LOOPING AROUND, BUT THIS
[ct=6498.726] IS WHERE THE PRESSURE ACTUALLY
[ct=6499.127] GETS HOME.
[ct=6501.543] NOBODY SEES HIM OFF THAT SPOT
[ct=6506.609] AL: A 52 YARD RETURN OFF AN
[ct=6511.457] AND BARTON, MEANWHILE A LOT OF
[ct=6514.222] PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM GO
[ct=6515.782] FOR TWO HERE, BUT THEY WILL
[ct=6517.131] SETTLE FOR ONE.
[ct=6517.708] THE KICK IS GOOD.
[ct=6526.641] AND THE SCORE IS NOW 33-3.
[ct=6531.887] THEY EVEN BROUGHT CONDOLEEZZA
[ct=6533.240] RICE INTO THE MEETING WHEN THEY
[ct=6535.905] HIRED SEAN PAYTON AS PART OF THE
[ct=6537.243] INTERVIEW PROCESS.
[ct=6537.243] THAT IS THE BIG TIME.
[ct=6539.946] SEAN NOW IN HIS SECOND YEAR
[ct=6545.249] THE RUNBACK
[ct=6547.831] SO THE BRONCOS WITH THE
[ct=6550.500] BRAND-NEW FACILITY.
[ct=6557.145] A BRAND-NEW TRAINING FACILITY,
[ct=6558.565] TEAM HEADQUARTERS IN INGLEWOOD,
[ct=6558.565] COLORADO.
[ct=6563.888] KIRK: GREAT FOOTBALL TOWN, THEY
[ct=6565.261] OBVIOUSLY LOVE THE BRONCOS.
[ct=6570.613] AL: IT'S A FRANCHISE THAT HAS
[ct=6573.158] BEEN THROUGH STRUGGLES.
[ct=6578.605] THEY WON THREE WITH ELWAY BACK
[ct=6579.859] TO BACK, THEN WINNING SUPER BOWL
[ct=6587.842] A NICE RUN HERE, AGAIN OF 16 FOR
[ct=6587.842] KENDRE MILLER.
[ct=6591.849] GO BACK TO THE ORANGE CRUSH DAYS
[ct=6594.414] BACK IN THE 1970'S.
[ct=6595.800] HERE WE GO.
[ct=6599.730] LIFE AFTER DREW.
[ct=6607.738] WE HAD DREW IN THE BOOTH
[ct=6613.063] MEANWHILE, THE INJURED BRONCO,
[ct=6613.063] FOR THE MOMENT.
[ct=6618.300] IT'S INTERESTING, THE BRONCOS
[ct=6623.690] WITH SEAN, MIKE SHANAHAN WAS
[ct=6626.324] THERE FOR 14 YEARS, TWO SUPER
[ct=6629.015] BOWLS, JOHN ELWAY RIDING OFF
[ct=6630.273] INTO THE ROCKY MOUNT SUNSET.
[ct=6631.675] SINCE IN THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH
[ct=6634.288] EIGHT OR NINE HEAD COACHES.
[ct=6634.288] MAYBE THEY HAVE FINALLY FOUND
[ct=6635.630] THEIR MAN.
[ct=6640.937] SEAN WAS OUT FOR A YEAR, WENT
[ct=6640.937] INTO TELEVISION BUT HE MISSED
[ct=6642.218] THE SCOREBOARD.
[ct=6644.995] WIN, LOSE, WHATEVER.
[ct=6648.830] YOU DON'T
[ct=6650.288] TELEVISION.
[ct=6654.284] KIRK: I FOUND IT INTERESTING
[ct=6655.566] THAT HE WAS OUT ONE YEAR, THEN
[ct=6655.566] HE WAS ABLE TO FIND AN
[ct=6659.589] BUT THEN IT WOULD JUST KIND OF
[ct=6660.807] FADE AWAY AFTER WE WERE DONE,
[ct=6662.137] AND I JUST MISSED
[ct=6663.601] I HAD TO PRACTICE THE
[ct=6664.873] COMPETITIVE SPIRIT THAT HE HAS.
[ct=6670.375] HE STILL HAS A LOT IN HIM AND I
[ct=6671.694] THINK HE FEELS HE CAN LEAD THAT
[ct=6672.919] FRANCHISE BACK TO THAT SUPER
[ct=6672.919] BOWL YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.
[ct=6678.342] AL: THAT WAS MATHIS WHO W
[ct=6679.604] OFF ON HIS OWN POWER, THE
[ct=6679.604] INJURED BRONCO.
[ct=6682.274] AT THE 37 YARD LINE.
[ct=6687.584] KEEP IT ON THE GROUND, NICE RUN
[ct=6694.264] KIRK: KIND OF A SLASHER KID OUT
[ct=6696.838] OF TCU, THE SECOND YEAR, HE HAS
[ct=6698.157] BATTLED THROUGH SOME INJURIES.
[ct=6702.087] KIND OF REPETITIVE COMMENTS
[ct=6702.087] ABOUT THE SAINTS.
[ct=6706.081] AL: SECOND AND ONE.
[ct=6707.739] IS FIRED AND INCOMPLETE.
[ct=6709.353] JOHNSON COULD NOT HOLD ON.
[ct=6712.205] THIRD DOWN AND ONE.
[ct=6719.103] AGAIN, THE BRONCOS IN A
[ct=6720.547] WILL HAVE CAROLINA, THEN KANSAS
[ct=6720.547] CITY.
[ct=6723.222] KANSAS CITY HAS BEEN THEIR
[ct=6724.638] NEMESIS FOR A LONG TIME.
[ct=6727.629] DIDN'T PLAY VERY WELL IN THAT
[ct=6729.495] ONE GAME AGAINST THEM LAST YEAR
[ct=6730.182] WE HAD A THURSDAY NIGHT GAME.
[ct=6735.121] THEY WILL TAKE IT OUT OF BOUNDS
[ct=6737.437] HERE, KENDRE MILLER.
[ct=6742.840] ANDY REID, THE WHOLE GANG.
[ct=6745.380] AFTER TONIGHT, EVERYBODY IS
[ct=6748.259] TALKING ABOUT CALEB WILLIAMS,
[ct=6753.872] 4-2 WITH CHICAGO, JAKE DANIELS
[ct=6754.387] WITH WASHINGTON.
[ct=6758.344] THEY MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE MORE
[ct=6758.833] NOTABILITY AFTER TONIGHT.
[ct=6764.271] KIRK: WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CALEB
[ct=6764.271] WILLIAMS AND JAKE DANIELS, THEY
[ct=6765.616] HAVE A LOT OF SPLASH PLACE.
[ct=6769.555] TO ME, IT'S ABOUT
[ct=6769.555] QUARTERBACKING.
[ct=6770.970] IT'S ABOUT HAVING A GOOD
[ct=6772.246] DEFENSE, PLAYING COMPLEMENTARY
[ct=6774.963] THEY HAVE GREAT SPECIAL TEAMS.
[ct=6777.610] THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THAT FOR
[ct=6778.929] THE MOST PART TONIGHT.
[ct=6784.289] IF THEY COME -- IF THEY CAN PLAY
[ct=6786.911] SMART WITH BO NIX WITH THIS
[ct=6788.261] DEFENSE, THEY WILL BE
[ct=6789.551] COMPETITIVE.
[ct=6793.555] AL: SLIDES THROUGH A HOLE HERE
[ct=6793.555] AT THE 48 YARD LINE.
[ct=6798.929] KIRK: HE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT FEELING
[ct=6800.227] 100% OUT THERE HIMSELF.
[ct=6802.859] AL: EMOTIONALLY AS WELL.
[ct=6816.217] THIRD DOWN AND FIVE AS THE CLOCK
[ct=6818.831] KEEPS ON ROLLING TO THE
[ct=6818.831] TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=6826.752] AND THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING IS
[ct=6828.096] UPON US.
[ct=6833.413] JAKE HAENER
[ct=6834.814] WHO HAS NOW COME IN.
[ct=6844.064] THAT PASS IS JUGGLED AND NOT
[ct=6844.064] CAUGHT BY TIPTON.
[ct=6849.352] YOU'VE GOT PASS INTERFERENCE
[ct=6849.352] COMING UP HERE AGAINST DENVER.
[ct=6852.074] THAT WILL GIVE THEM AN AUTOMATIC
[ct=6862.827] HAENER GOT INTO A COUPLE OF
[ct=6864.063] GAMES EARLY ON BUT IT WAS TWO
[ct=6865.348] BLOWOUT WINS.
[ct=6868.072] OUT OF FRESNO STATE, AS IS DEREK
[ct=6870.702] CARR, CHECK OUT RENTAL ON THE
[ct=6872.035] SIDELINE.
[ct=6874.785] KIRK: MUCH MORE OF A
[ct=6876.063] DISTRIBUTOR, GET THE BALL OUT OF
[ct=6876.063] HIS HANDS QUICK.
[ct=6880.031] AL: HE DOES THERE AND HITS MASON
[ct=6880.031] TIPTON THERE.
[ct=6882.697] LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO
[ct=6886.788] CHASED BY MCMILLAN, TAKEN DOWN.
[ct=6890.669] KIRK: ON THE INTERCEPTION.
[ct=6894.658] AL: INSULT TO INJURY.
[ct=6905.275] TALKING ABOUT SEAN PAYTON SUPER
[ct=6906.713] BOWL IN HIS FOURTH YEAR HERE,
[ct=6906.713] 2009.
[ct=6911.998] GETTING -- THE CITY GETTING
[ct=6915.900] RESURRECTED AFTER KATRINA HIT IN
[ct=6917.217] AUGUST OF 2005.
[ct=6919.920] DREW BREES TAKES OVER THERE AND
[ct=6922.664] THE SAINTS WIN THE SUPER BOWL.
[ct=6925.230] WHAT A NIGHT.
[ct=6927.877] KIRK: WHAT I REMEMBER ABOUT THAT
[ct=6933.214] IS DREW BREES' SON HE WAS,
[ct=6934.547] HOLDING HIM, A LITTLE GUY.
[ct=6938.528] ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES HE WAS
[ct=6939.813] HOLDING THE HEADPHONES TO TRY TO
[ct=6941.136] PROTECT HIM FROM THE NOISE.
[ct=6943.874] AL: BIG SPORTS ILLUSTRATED COVER
[ct=6946.596] STORY ON DREW AT THAT TIME.
[ct=6947.921] SECOND DOWN AND ONE.
[ct=6949.220] HAELN
[ct=6953.822] HAEENER STEPS INTO THE POCKET.
[ct=6956.316] A TON OF DROPPED PASSES AND
[ct=6958.149] MISSED TACKLES TONIGHT.
[ct=6960.383] KIRK: A LOT OF STUFF TO CLEAN
[ct=6964.235] A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT WITH
[ct=6968.066] HAENER AS THE BACKUP HE MIGHT
[ct=6969.790] GET AN OPPORTUNITY WHEN CARR
[ct=6973.340] WENT DOWN, AND RIGHT ON HER WENT
[ct=6975.895] FROM BEING THE STARTER THE LAST
[ct=6975.895] COUPLE OF GAMES.
[ct=6978.526] I THINK HE BRINGS A LITTLE BIT
[ct=6981.228] OF JUICE TO THE OFFENSE, HIS
[ct=6982.674] PERSONALITY.
[ct=6985.900] HE MOVES AROUND A LOT BETTER
[ct=6988.716] THAN HAENER.
[ct=6995.251] AL: THAT'S A FIRST DOWN AND
[ct=6995.251] MORE.
[ct=6999.305] AT THE 11 YARD LINE GOES CEDRIC
[ct=6999.305] WILSON.
[ct=7004.498] KIRK: HAENER GETS THE BALL OUT.
[ct=7006.758] IF YOU WERE GOING TO STATE HIS
[ct=7008.033] CASE WHY HE SHOULD GET THE
[ct=7011.909] OPPORTUNITY TO THROW, EVEN IF
[ct=7015.536] THEY PRESSURE ME, I'M NOT GOING
[ct=7016.638] TO RUN AROUND, I'M GOING TO GET
[ct=7016.638] THE BALL OUT.
[ct=7021.823] HE MOVES A BIT SLOWER IN THE
[ct=7023.139] SEASON, RIGHT AWAY HAS AN ANSWER
[ct=7026.042] TO GET THE BALL OUT OF HIS HANDS
[ct=7027.774] AND GET THE FIRST DOWN WITH
[ct=7028.089] CEDRIC WILSON.
[ct=7030.607] AL: THEY TAKE A TIMEOUT HERE
[ct=7032.780] WHICH IS MUSIC TO THE EARS OF
[ct=7037.360] SOME OF OUR REP PROBATE FRIENDS.
[ct=7039.618] KIRK: WE ARE VERY CLOSE HERE.
[ct=7041.350] AL: WE ARE.
[ct=7046.724] 33-3 IS THE SCORE.
[ct=7050.794] HOW IT STARTED, HOW IT'S GOING,
[ct=7051.387] THE FIRST TWO GAMES, EVERYBODY
[ct=7051.791] IS TALKING ABOUT IT.
[ct=7055.154] HOW ABOUT THEM SAINTS?
[ct=7059.897] THE LAST FIVE, YUCK.
[ct=7064.933] FROM THE 12.
[ct=7071.729] FIRED, CAUGHT, TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=7077.248] KIRK: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
[ct=7082.382] BUT IT'S THAT QUICK RELEASE AND
[ct=7087.125] THE DOLLED UP PRESSURE IN THE
[ct=7087.566] RED ZONE.
[ct=7087.948] THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE RED ZONE
[ct=7089.271] DEFENSE IN THE NFL IN THE BALL
[ct=7089.758] HAS NOT GOTTEN OUT LIKE THIS ALL
[ct=7093.447] HE IS IN HIS SECOND YEAR WOULD
[ct=7093.694] LOOK AT ALL THOSE WHITE JERSEYS.
[ct=7097.070] TRYING TO CREATE SOME CONFUSION,
[ct=7099.579] MAKE HIM HESITANT.
[ct=7101.614] HE SEES IT RIGHT AWAY AND IT IS
[ct=7102.464] OUT OF HIS HANDS, AND IT IS
[ct=7102.946] ACCURATE.
[ct=7107.321] A COUPLE OF NICE ROSE FOR NUMBER
[ct=7107.568] THREE.
[ct=7115.746] AL: NOW YOU CAN SAY THE GAME IS
[ct=7115.746] OFFICIALLY
[ct=7119.097] KIRK: I THINK SO.
[ct=7127.595] AL: GOT TO KEEP AN AUDIENCE,
[ct=7127.998] WHAT CAN I TELL YOU.
[ct=7134.874] SEAN PAYTON, MIKE WESTOFF, THE
[ct=7134.874] LONGTIME SPECIAL TEAMS COACH.
[ct=7140.432] SEAN PAYTON DOESN'T LIKE TO GIVE
[ct=7141.910] CIRCUMSTANCE.
[ct=7145.922] THEY BRING IN HAENER AND ALL HE
[ct=7147.640] DOES THIS GO THREE OUT OF FOUR
[ct=7148.565] FOR 38 YARDS AND A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=7154.078] SO HERE WE GO, IF CARR CAN PLAY
[ct=7155.379] IN THE NEXT GAME, WHAT DO YOU
[ct=7156.620] DO?
[ct=7163.542] KIRK: BASED ON WHAT WE JUST SAW,
[ct=7164.496] THAT IS THE BEST EXECUTION THAT
[ct=7165.323] WE HAVE SEEN ALL NIGHT.
[ct=7172.140] AL: THAT'S 1:38, WHATEVER IT
[ct=7172.399] WAS.
[ct=7175.805] KIRK: HOW QUICKLY HE MADE THE
[ct=7178.111] DECISION AND HOW THE BALL GOT
[ct=7178.681] OUT AND HOW ACCURATE HE THROWS
[ct=7179.637] IT.
[ct=7182.569] I THINK NEXT GAME YOU MIGHT WANT
[ct=7186.516] TO SEE HIM UNDER CENTER, JUST
[ct=7188.110] SEE IF HE CAN KEEP THAT GOING.
[ct=7191.793] AL: THE NEXT GAME WILL BE IN
[ct=7193.874] L.A. AGAINST THE CHARGERS
[ct=7193.874] SUNDAY.
[ct=7197.403] THEN THEY GO TO CHARLOTTE TO
[ct=7197.830] MEET THE PANTHERS.
[ct=7201.571] SO THEY HAVE DECLARED FOREIGN
[ct=7203.065] ONSIDE KICK, WHICH YOU HAVE TO
[ct=7203.350] DO THESE DAYS.
[ct=7211.704] IN THE PUNTER WILL TRY TO KICK
[ct=7213.938] IT THE NEEDED 10 YARDS.
[ct=7218.816] AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
[ct=7219.562] SECURE POSSESSION AGAIN.
[ct=7222.784] KIRK: DENVER CALLED A TIMEOUT
[ct=7224.442] JUST TO KEEP YOU HONEST.
[ct=7233.152] WANT TO MAKE SURE WE USE OUR
[ct=7234.273] FULL ALLOTMENT.
[ct=7238.812] AL: THEY STILL HAVE ONE
[ct=7245.980] I DON'T THINK SO, WE WILL SEE.
[ct=7251.301] DENNIS ALLEN, OF A MAN WHO VERY
[ct=7253.253] MUCH IS GOING TO TAKE SOME HEAT.
[ct=7254.965] YOU LOSE FIVE IN A ROW AND EVERY
[ct=7255.942] COACH IS GOING TO TAKE SOME
[ct=7256.372] HEAT.
[ct=7259.362] KIRK: HE'S NOT GOING TO EVER SAY
[ct=7262.025] INJURIES.
[ct=7269.159] PEOPLE JUST SAY 2-0, WHAT HAS
[ct=7272.818] HAPPENED IN THE LAST FIVE >> I'M
[ct=7274.181] NOT MAKING EXCUSES FOR HIM, YOU
[ct=7276.820] LOSE YOUR STARTING QUARTERBACK,
[ct=7278.391] YOUR TOP TWO RECEIVERS, TWO OF
[ct=7279.134] YOUR BEST OFFENSIVE LINEMAN.
[ct=7283.079] UP ON THE DEFENSIVE SIDE.
[ct=7288.637] IT'S REALLY TOUGH TO MAINTAIN A
[ct=7288.637] CERTAIN LEVEL WHEN YOU HAVE THAT
[ct=7289.194] MANY INJURIES.
[ct=7298.974] AL: AND NUMBER TWO OUT ON A
[ct=7300.002] CONCUSSION LAST WEEK.
[ct=7300.799] HERE COMES THE ATTEMPTED ONSIDE
[ct=7304.260] KICK WHICH WILL BE SECURED BY
[ct=7306.102] THE DENVER BRONCOS.
[ct=7308.258] P.J. LOCKE LOCKS IT UP.
[ct=7310.679] WHAT A WORD MASTER I AM.
[ct=7313.522] KIRK: WELL, YOU BEEN DOING IT
[ct=7313.799] FOR SO LONG.
[ct=7321.705] AL: 31 GAMES WITH MY GUYS.
[ct=7324.461] KIRK: WHAT WAS THE FIRST YEAR
[ct=7324.961] YOU CAME IN HERE?
[ct=7328.933] AL: I ACTUALLY DID A GAME HERE
[ct=7329.453] IN 1975.
[ct=7333.121] I DID GAME LATE IN THE SEASON
[ct=7333.664] WITH HANK STRAM ON CBS.
[ct=7336.673] WE WERE GOING TO HAVE DINNER THE
[ct=7337.547] NIGHT BEFORE THE GAME AND HE
[ct=7338.602] SAID I CAN'T, BECAUSE THE OWNER
[ct=7341.357] OF THE TEAM WANTS TO HAVE DINNER
[ct=7341.357] WITH ME.
[ct=7344.157] AND I SAID HE'S GOING TO TRY TO
[ct=7344.157] HIRE YOU, AND HE DID.
[ct=7347.777] AND THEN HANK CAME HERE AFTER HE
[ct=7349.679] GOT BARBARA KANSAS CITY AND WAS
[ct=7350.699] WORKING ONE YEAR FOR CBS.
[ct=7352.089] HE COMES HERE AND COACHES THE
[ct=7355.381] KIRK: FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.
[ct=7359.662] AL: THEN GOT BACK INTO
[ct=7360.246] BROADCASTING.
[ct=7364.897] DID A GREAT JOB WITH JOE BUCK.
[ct=7370.403] THE BRONCOS WOULD HAVE A HAPPY
[ct=7374.657] KIRK: ALL THE TALK ABOUT SEAN
[ct=7376.496] PAYTON COMING BACK, IT WAS COOL
[ct=7376.898] HE WENT THIS AFTERNOON TO
[ct=7379.247] CELEBRATE DREW BREES.
[ct=7381.062] THOSE TWO WILL BE CONNECTED
[ct=7382.199] FOREVER IN THIS TOWN AND FOR
[ct=7382.622] FOOTBALL FANS.
[ct=7384.252] AND HE WAS ABLE TO GET THE WIN,
[ct=7386.358] SO MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.
[ct=7388.464] HE WANTED TO PAY TRIBUTE AND
[ct=7391.011] ALSO BRING HIS TEAM ON A
[ct=7392.846] BUSINESS TRIP BACK TO NEW
[ct=7398.095] ORLEANS AND GET THE W, 33-10.
[ct=7398.331] ONWARD, GET READY FOR THE
[ct=7399.823] ONE.
[ct=7402.801] AL: THAT TAKES US TO THE 40
[ct=7403.983] SECOND MARK, WHICH MEANS NO MORE
[ct=7405.598] PLAY IS NECESSARY.
[ct=7409.030] TO SEAN PAYTON, COMES BACK 15
[ct=7410.971] YEARS AS THE SAINTS HEAD COACH.
[ct=7416.445] COMES OVER WITH HIS MAN DENNIS
[ct=7418.040] ALLEN WAS HIS ASSISTANT 12
[ct=7418.800] YEARS.
[ct=7421.258] TWO DIFFERENT TENURES.
[ct=7424.549] MIKE WESTOFF ALSO COMING OVER TO
[ct=7425.308] SHAKE HIS HAND AS WELL.
[ct=7429.821] AND THE DENVER BRONCOS ARE ABOVE
[ct=7432.533] 500, AT 4-3.
[ct=7435.529] BO NIX, A GOOD NIGHT FOR HIM.
[ct=7443.511] 75 YARDS ON THE GROUND AS THE
[ct=7445.179] BRONCOS WIN IT BY A SCORE OF
[ct=7447.440] 33-10.
