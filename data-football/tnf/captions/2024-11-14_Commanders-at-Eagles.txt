[ct=24.388] THE GIANTS, DAN QUINN,
[ct=24.951] CONTINUING TO THE SUPER BOWL.
[ct=30.364] A LITTLE BREEZY AND COLD
[ct=30.689] TONIGHT.
[ct=33.492] AT LINCOLN FINANCIAL FIELD.
[ct=35.736] WASHINGTON WINS THE TOSS.
[ct=44.257] THEY HAVE THE THIRD SO RIGHT OFF
[ct=45.461] THE BAT JALEN HURTS WILL BE
[ct=45.461] READY TO GO.
[ct=50.618] CYRUS HAD A GREAT YEAR BUT HE
[ct=53.906] HAS A HIP INJURY, SECOND
[ct=55.382] STRAIGHT GAME AND THE KICK WILL
[ct=56.153] BE DOWN IN THE END ZONE.
[ct=59.425] GO TO WORK AT THE 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=66.242] SO MUCH GOODNESS HAPPENED.
[ct=72.524] 12 TOUCHDOWN PASSES AND 10
[ct=72.524] TOUCHDOWN RUNS THIS SEASON.
[ct=80.283] A FEW OF THOSE, IT HAS BECOME A
[ct=81.455] STAPLE, HOPE WE SEE ONE TONIGHT.
[ct=91.206] LEFT TACKLE FROM AUSTRALIA,
[ct=91.206] SIGNALING THE OFFENSE OF FRONT.
[ct=95.550] THE SMOKE FROM THE FIREWORKS IS
[ct=95.950] CLEARING AND HERE WE GO.
[ct=99.543] A GOOD PASS TO THE RIGHT SIDE.
[ct=104.879] HE WAS A FIRST ROUND PICK A
[ct=106.010] COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, THEY LET
[ct=106.608] HIM GO.
[ct=113.377] HE PICKS UP EIGHT, SECOND AND
[ct=113.377] TWO.
[ct=119.643] KIRK: THEY'VE GOTTEN HEALTHIER,
[ct=123.217] GOOD TO SEE AJAY BROWN AND
[ct=123.413] DEVONTA SMITH BACK AT TIGHT END
[ct=126.248] AND WE SEE THE LEFT TACKLE.
[ct=129.892] RUNNING THE FOOTBALL AND SETTING
[ct=133.851] UP PLAY ACTION FOR JALEN HURTS.
[ct=137.276] THE NEW OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR.
[ct=143.117] AL: ON THE INSIDE, JALEN HURTS,
[ct=143.351] THE PRESSURE WAS ON.
[ct=150.003] IT IS THIRD DOWN AND TWO YARDS.
[ct=151.339] FOR PHILADELPHIA.
[ct=153.893] THE OFFENSE OF COORDINATOR WAS
[ct=155.466] IN DALLAS, THEN WENT TO THE
[ct=156.362] CHARGERS AND HE AND JALEN HURTS
[ct=160.591] HAVE CLICKED EXTREMELY WELL.
[ct=167.256] THIRD AND 2 FROM THE 30 EIGHT
[ct=168.349] YARD LINE.
[ct=170.986] STRAIGHT AHEAD, PICKS UP.
[ct=174.860] KIRK: IT WILL BE A GOOD BATTLE
[ct=176.735] TONIGHT, THE WAY IT SHOULD BE
[ct=178.686] WHEN THESE TEAMS GET TOGETHER IN
[ct=179.899] THE TRENCHES, ESPECIALLY IN THE
[ct=180.093] INTERIOR.
[ct=188.973] AL: LEFT GUARD, DICKERSON.
[ct=192.351] A TIMEOUT FOR THE MOMENT.
[ct=198.649] KIRK: BERKELEY FISHING THAT RUN.
[ct=200.505] IT MAY HAVE ROLLED UP ON THE
[ct=203.105] BACK OF HIS NECK.
[ct=207.138] TRYING TO PICK UP THE FIRST
[ct=208.686] DOWN, THIRD AND SHORT AND AS HE
[ct=211.104] GETS TO THE END OF THIS PLAY
[ct=211.104] RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
[ct=215.698] SCREEN JUST GOES UP ON THAT
[ct=218.443] RIGHT LEG, WALKING OFF THE FIELD
[ct=219.682] NOW, NOT A WHOLE LOT OF WEIGHT
[ct=219.876] ON IT.
[ct=228.029] AL: TYLER STEEN, SECOND ROUND
[ct=228.847] OUT OF ALABAMA WILL TAKE HIS
[ct=229.094] SPOT.
[ct=234.198] KIRK: DICKERSON HAS A LOT TO DO
[ct=238.549] WITH THE BATTLE IN TERMS OF THE
[ct=241.234] LEADERSHIP WITH JASON KELCE AND
[ct=243.036] JURGENSEN, THE CENTER DID A GOOD
[ct=244.262] JOB BUT THEY RELY ON JURGENSEN
[ct=244.461] TO SET THE TONE.
[ct=250.678] AL: HE COMES TO THE BENCH, NICK
[ct=254.885] SIRIANNI ON THE SIDELINE, FIRST
[ct=255.565] DOWN FROM THE 41 YARD LINE.
[ct=261.991] SMITH IS IN MOTION, KEEPING IT
[ct=262.449] ON THE GROUND.
[ct=268.360] SECOND DOWN AND FOUR YARDS
[ct=270.978] BEFORE HE IS PUSHED BACK, THE
[ct=275.351] CROWD WANTS A FLAG BUT THERE IS
[ct=275.583] NONE.
[ct=278.632] SECOND AND SIX.
[ct=282.804] KIRK: I ASSUMED BOBBY WAGONER ON
[ct=284.527] HIS 13TH YEAR, HE HAS BOUNCED
[ct=285.617] AROUND AND HERE HE IS IN
[ct=286.114] WASHINGTON.
[ct=294.661] SAQUON BARKLEY, PLAYED WITH HIM,
[ct=297.144] FIRST TIME THESE TWO HAVE GONE
[ct=299.517] HEAD TO HEAD, FIRST CHANCE TO
[ct=299.731] BRING IT BACK.
[ct=304.147] AL: FLAG ON THE PLAY, SECOND
[ct=305.452] DOWN AND 6, 4 MAN.
[ct=312.345] THROWING, INCOMPLETE, DODSON WAS
[ct=315.128] COVERED, WHAT A GREAT GAME LAST
[ct=315.128] SUNDAY.
[ct=316.930] THIRD DOWN AND SIX.
[ct=322.284] KIRK: DAN QUINN HAS A REPUTATION
[ct=323.597] OF BEING AGGRESSIVE AND COMING
[ct=327.590] AFTER QUARTERBACKS HERE, JUST
[ct=330.957] SITTING BACK AND WE SAW THE LAST
[ct=332.347] PLAY, TRY TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN
[ct=332.515] FRONT OF THEM.
[ct=338.907] TAKING WHAT JALEN HURTS HIGHWAY.
[ct=342.642] AL: DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR OF
[ct=345.930] SEATTLE WINNING THE SUPER BOWL.
[ct=347.970] A THIRD DOWN AND SIX.
[ct=353.616] IN THE POCKET, THROWS, CAUGHT
[ct=359.374] AND FIRST DOWN, AJAY BROWN,
[ct=363.401] BROWN GOT BACK HEALTHY AND HERE
[ct=364.349] THEY GO ON A WINNING STREAK.
[ct=369.389] KIRK: THEY SHOW PRESSURE HAS
[ct=374.643] BEEN BACK, GOOD JOB RECOGNIZING
[ct=375.546] DOES THEM AND SITTING DOWN.
[ct=382.319] AL: AROUND AGAIN, PULLING ITS
[ct=388.960] WAY TO THE 22 YARD LINE, 26.
[ct=394.503] KIRK: BOTH OF THESE TEAMS WILL
[ct=396.158] DO A LOT OF TEMPO, ESPECIALLY
[ct=403.648] IT SIGNIFIES TO JALEN HURTS, HE
[ct=404.957] GETS IT OUT OF HIS HANDS
[ct=404.957] QUICKLY.
[ct=411.034] AL: SAQUON BARKLEY TRIED TO SLIP
[ct=411.232] AWAY, BUT NO.
[ct=418.754] COLTS, NUMBER 96, THE TACKLE
[ct=418.972] THERE.
[ct=421.038] SECOND DOWN AND 11.
[ct=424.174] EXCELLENT WORK CALLING THE
[ct=424.442] PLAYS.
[ct=428.998] AT ONE POINT IT MIGHT BE -- IT
[ct=431.888] LOOKED LIKE HE MIGHT BE THE HEAD
[ct=432.412] COACH IN DALLAS.
[ct=435.057] HE IS FINDING A GOOD HOME HERE.
[ct=439.801] SECOND AND 12, 29 YARD LINE.
[ct=448.900] EXTRA BAND COMING.
[ct=454.892] JALEN HURTS IS FLUSHED OUT,
[ct=455.411] CAUGHT ALONG THE SIDELINE.
[ct=462.630] ANAÏS SMITH MAKES THE CATCH.
[ct=465.905] ADRIAN HILL IS THE REFEREE, YOU
[ct=467.191] WILL HEAR HIS VOICE FOR THE
[ct=467.191] FIRST TIME TONIGHT.
[ct=472.566] REFEREE: HOLDING, OFFENSE,
[ct=475.010] NUMBER 77, 10 YARD PENALTY,
[ct=475.224] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=481.305] KIRK: WITH THE JETS AS A TACKLE,
[ct=482.366] THEY MOVED HIM WHEN HE CAME TO
[ct=482.617] PHILADELPHIA.
[ct=488.850] ONE THING HE GIVES UP IS HIS
[ct=489.079] QUICKNESS.
[ct=494.122] SO SHELTON USES THE QUICKNESS TO
[ct=497.339] GET AROUND HIM, BIG FELLA, GRABS
[ct=497.628] AROUND HIM.
[ct=504.472] INSTEAD THEY TAKE THE PENALTY TO
[ct=507.966] BE SECOND AND 22.
[ct=512.733] AL: DICKERSON TRYING TO WORK HIS
[ct=514.089] WAY BACK.
[ct=515.385] IT SECOND AND 22.
[ct=521.995] AND THEN PRESSURE PUT ON, JALEN
[ct=524.866] HURTS GETS TO THIRD DOWN.
[ct=531.173] KIRK: THE CHALLENGE IS THE
[ct=531.173] PHYSICALITY WITH BERKELEY --
[ct=531.361] SAQUON BARKLEY.
[ct=536.868] YOU LEAVE YOUR CORNERS ON
[ct=542.726] ISLANDS BUT A LOT OF COVERAGE,
[ct=544.645] SITTING BACK, MAKING JALEN HURTS
[ct=544.849] HOLD THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=550.799] THEY GET DOWN, THE SAFETY.
[ct=555.676] AL: THEY SEND THREE RECEIVERS TO
[ct=557.461] THE RIGHT SIDE.
[ct=563.909] FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT FOR POWELL,
[ct=565.998] ON THE 20 FIVE HE GOES.
[ct=567.802] FOURTH DOWN, 26 YARD LINE.
[ct=572.365] THEY WILL TRY TO MAKE IT 3-0.
[ct=575.363] KIRK: THE POTENTIAL OF THE
[ct=580.211] OFFENSE AND WHAT THEY CAN DO,
[ct=581.291] THE WAY THEY ARE MOVING THE
[ct=585.240] FOOTBALL, PUSHING FROM BEHIND
[ct=588.181] THE STICKS TO SEE IF THEY GET
[ct=588.562] THREE POINTS.
[ct=596.981] AL: THEY GOT HIM OFF THE
[ct=599.365] CINCINNATI PRACTICE SQUAD IN
[ct=599.593] 2017.
[ct=600.473] THE KICK IS NO GOOD.
[ct=606.057] HE HAS MISSED A FEW THIS YEAR IN
[ct=607.824] THE CROWD LETS HIM KNOW.
[ct=613.034] THE COMMANDERS HOLD, THEY KEEP
[ct=616.713] IT SCORELESS, A NEW SERIES CROSS
[ct=617.334] STREAMING NOW ON PRIME VIDEO.
[ct=623.086] MEANWHILE BRIAN ROBERTSON, ON
[ct=631.591] AWAITING, STRUGGLING, OUT OF
[ct=636.536] BOUNDS AFTER A SHORT PICK UP OF
[ct=636.536] FIVE.
[ct=640.795] THERE IS DANIELS.
[ct=643.282] THE GREAT THING, ONLY TO
[ct=656.606] INTERCEPTION AND MEANWHILE
[ct=660.301] ROBINSON GETS THE RUNNING BACKS
[ct=667.759] KIRK: NICE JOB GETTING OF HILL,
[ct=668.261] HE'S THE REAL DEAL.
[ct=672.407] GOING UP AGAINST JUSTIN.
[ct=680.598] SHOWING TREMENDOUS POISE AS A
[ct=681.929] FRESHMAN AND ONLY GETTING BETTER
[ct=686.906] HE IS A POCKET QUARTERBACK ON
[ct=687.141] THIRD DOWN.
[ct=694.897] AL: HE GOES TO LSU AND WINS THE
[ct=699.717] REALLY TREMENDOUS THIS SEASON.
[ct=706.163] I DON'T WANT TO SAY LOST IN THE
[ct=709.379] SHUFFLE BUT HE’
[ct=710.264] SHUFFLE BUT HE'S HAVING A GREAT
[ct=710.264] YEAR.
[ct=723.338] KIRK: OUTSIDE LINEBACKER, EDGE
[ct=723.338] GUY.
[ct=728.694] A LINEBACKER, YOU ROLL THE DICE
[ct=729.551] AND HOPE HE CAN COME THROUGH.
[ct=1023.862] AL: -- INTERCEPTION, FUMBLE AND
[ct=1024.347] GIANT FANS WENT CRAZY.
[ct=1033.471] IT WAS AN UGLY NIGHT.
[ct=1036.329] TO THE LEFT SIDE.
[ct=1045.254] STILL GOING, CATCHES UP WITH
[ct=1045.254] HIM.
[ct=1047.988] YOU GOT A LITTLE SCRIMMAGE GOING
[ct=1049.260] ON.
[ct=1053.312] -- SKIRMISH GOING ON.
[ct=1059.948] KIRK: WE KNOW ECKLER IS
[ct=1060.099] DANGEROUS OUT OF THE BACKFIELD
[ct=1063.597] BUT SACK FIELD, IT'S
[ct=1063.816] COMMUNICATION.
[ct=1069.421] WATCHING ECKLER MOVE, HE IS OUT
[ct=1071.291] THERE ON HIS OWN END HE SO
[ct=1073.021] DANGEROUS AFTER THE CATCH.
[ct=1079.744] THAT'S JUST A DEFENSE NOT QUITE
[ct=1080.381] ON THE SAME PAGE AND TO ME IT
[ct=1082.760] LOOKED LIKE THEY JUST DIDN'T
[ct=1083.094] TAKE HIM OFF THE MOTION.
[ct=1087.024] AL: HERE GOES DAINES, HE WILL
[ct=1087.762] RUN AND HE CAN RUN.
[ct=1093.826] I WOULD SAY ECKLER, YOU TALKED
[ct=1094.984] ABOUT ALL THE PICKUPS ON DEFENSE
[ct=1097.761] AND OFFENSE, NO STRANGER TO THE
[ct=1098.059] END ZONE.
[ct=1103.005] KIRK: HAD GREAT ASSIGN IS THAT
[ct=1103.321] FOR COMMANDERS FANS TO SEE JAKE
[ct=1104.079] DANIELS RUN THE FOOTBALL?
[ct=1109.274] THE LAST FOUR WEEKS THEY'VE BEEN
[ct=1109.529] PROTECTED HIM BECAUSE OF THE
[ct=1111.534] RIBS WITH THE CAROLINA GAME.
[ct=1115.640] HE'S ABLE TO SHOW HE IS OUT TO
[ct=1116.013] RUN THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=1120.609] AL: AGAIN IN THE BACKFIELD, TO
[ct=1121.178] ROBINSON AND ROBINSON WILL TAKE
[ct=1122.574] THE BALL TO THE 1-YARD LINE.
[ct=1126.013] BRIAN ROBINSON HAS MISSED THE
[ct=1126.931] LAST TWO GAMES WITH A HAMSTRING.
[ct=1130.160] THREE EXTRA DAYS, GAVE HIM THE
[ct=1132.350] OPPORTUNITY TO HEAL ENOUGH.
[ct=1136.283] AT THE 1-YARD LINE THEY GO
[ct=1136.620] NO-HUDDLE.
[ct=1141.062] KIRK: YOU MENTIONED THE TWO
[ct=1143.402] BACKS, ONE ONE-WAY AND THE OTHER
[ct=1144.682] THE OTHER, THEY SLOWED THE
[ct=1144.904] LINEBACKERS DOWN, THEY WERE
[ct=1145.198] HESITANT.
[ct=1149.056] AL: THIS TIME THEY GIVE IT TO
[ct=1149.717] ROBINSON AND HE PUSHES HIS WAY
[ct=1151.626] IN AND WILL THEY GIVE IT TO HIM?
[ct=1153.269] THEY DO.
[ct=1158.017] TOUCHDOWN WASHINGTON.
[ct=1164.101] KIRK: THAT IS WHAT THIS OFFENSE
[ct=1165.332] HAS MISSED THE LAST COUPLE OF
[ct=1167.196] GAMES, NOT HAVING THE BACK THAT
[ct=1169.315] CAN POUND TO GET YOU THE TOUGH
[ct=1169.562] YARDS.
[ct=1172.058] HE STOPPED AT THE TWO OR THREE
[ct=1175.981] BLANKENSHIP IS THERE BUT HE
[ct=1176.889] WOULD NOT BE DENIED AND GETS A
[ct=1177.529] LITTLE HELP.
[ct=1181.780] DAN QUINN HAS TO BE FIRED UP.
[ct=1188.752] BRIAN ROBINSON WILL BE HELPING
[ct=1189.813] OUT THE OFFENSE AND GIVE US THE
[ct=1190.531] PHYSICALITY THEY'VE BEEN
[ct=1190.531] MISSING.
[ct=1194.383] AL: GONZALEZ, PERFECT DAY LAST
[ct=1194.383] WEEK.
[ct=1198.986] THAT WAS QUICK, TWO MINUTES, 58
[ct=1201.705] 7-0.
[ct=1204.915] A COUPLE OF WINS, THEY COULD BE
[ct=1206.210] 11-0 GOING INTO THE GAME, WE
[ct=1206.429] WILL SEE.
[ct=1208.543] THAT'S THE DAY AFTER
[ct=1210.289] THANKSGIVING ON PRIME.
[ct=1214.459] KIRK: WHAT KIND OF INTENSITY
[ct=1215.887] DOES DAN QUINN INTO THE
[ct=1216.867] FRANCHISE?
[ct=1221.574] EVERY PERSON YOU TALK TO, THE
[ct=1223.030] COMMANDERS A YEAR AGO, IT'S A
[ct=1225.394] COMPLETE ABOUT-FACE AS FAR AS
[ct=1226.944] THE DIRECTION THE FRANCHISE IS
[ct=1227.232] HEADING.
[ct=1231.551] NEW OWNERSHIP, NEW GM, NEW
[ct=1232.261] QUARTERBACK, NEW HEAD COACH, NEW
[ct=1232.498] SYSTEM.
[ct=1234.628] THERE'S A LOT TO LIKE ABOUT WHAT
[ct=1235.814] THESE GUYS ARE DOING.
[ct=1238.236] AL: HE CAME OVER FROM SAN
[ct=1238.575] FRANCISCO.
[ct=1241.580] SHIPLEY ON THE RUN BACK, A GOOD
[ct=1242.954] RUN BACK BEFORE HE'S TAKEN OUT
[ct=1243.190] OF BOUNDS.
[ct=1247.767] KAYLEE: WE HEAR IT EVERY WEEK,
[ct=1248.762] PLAYING ON A QUICK TURNAROUND IS
[ct=1251.564] NEVER EASY SO DAN QUINN TOLD THE
[ct=1252.248] COMMANDERS IT IS SHARK WEEK.
[ct=1254.852] IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW BATTERED
[ct=1256.483] OR SORE THEY ARE, YOU HAVE TO
[ct=1258.823] KEEP ACTING LIKE SHARKS DO.
[ct=1263.120] REALLY TURNED HIM UP WHEN HE
[ct=1264.745] STARTED PREACHING THE
[ct=1265.781] MONDAY.
[ct=1267.555] HE WAS SHOWING THE TEAM CLIPS
[ct=1269.967] FROM JAWS AND I THINK YOU'RE
[ct=1271.336] GONNA NEED A BIGGER BOAT.
[ct=1273.808] AL: HE WOULD BE A CANDIDATE FOR
[ct=1274.768] SHARK TANK AS WELL I GUESS.
[ct=1277.207] WILL BE.
[ct=1280.583] AL: JALEN HURTS TO GO WITH 320
[ct=1284.249] IN THE OPENING QUARTER.
[ct=1286.248] WASHINGTON UP 7-0.
[ct=1294.497] THROWING DOWN THE SIDELINE AND
[ct=1297.015] THAT IS COMPLETE TO DEVONTA
[ct=1297.015] SMITH.
[ct=1301.331] ANOTHER GUY WHO WON A HEISMAN
[ct=1301.563] TROPHY.
[ct=1305.135] KIRK: USUALLY VERY SHORTHANDED
[ct=1306.871] AND I THINK AT THAT TIME THEY BE
[ct=1308.008] MORE CONCERNED ABOUT HIS FEET
[ct=1309.469] AND CATCHING THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=1313.703] ONE THING ABOUT DAN QUINN, YOU
[ct=1316.868] ARE LIKE THIS, I WANT A SHORT
[ct=1319.183] WEEK, ANYTHING YOU BRING IT TO
[ct=1320.043] HIM HE TURNS INTO A POSITIVE.
[ct=1323.059] HE WILL ALWAYS FIND A WAY TO
[ct=1324.819] DEFLECT AND BE POSITIVE ABOUT
[ct=1325.192] SOMETHING.
[ct=1328.243] AL: HE IS INTENSE BUT A LOT OF
[ct=1328.243] FUN TO BE AROUND.
[ct=1332.173] I'VE KNOWN HIM A LONG TIME, A
[ct=1332.461] GOOD MAN.
[ct=1334.926] COACHED ATLANTA FOR A NUMBER OF
[ct=1335.807] YEARS.
[ct=1340.195] OUT TO THE 43 YARD LINE DOES
[ct=1345.258] KIRK: TIED INTO A REALLY GOOD
[ct=1347.100] JOB ON THE PERIMETER IN THE RUN
[ct=1347.383] GAME.
[ct=1351.439] THE OFFENSE IS DEPENDENT ON
[ct=1352.032] THEIR ABILITY TO RUN THE
[ct=1352.032] FOOTBALL.
[ct=1356.036] WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE GOOD PLAY
[ct=1357.699] ON WHAT THEY CAN DO DOWNFIELD
[ct=1358.325] AND THAT IS PART OF IT BUT IT
[ct=1360.341] STARTS WITH WHAT THEY DO WITH
[ct=1360.856] THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE THE LAST
[ct=1361.541] FIVE WEEKS.
[ct=1366.169] RUN THE FOOTBALL TO SAQUON
[ct=1366.403] BARKLEY, OCCASIONALLY JALEN
[ct=1367.382] HURTS, GET THE DEFENSE, WORRY
[ct=1369.248] ABOUT THE RUN GAME AND THE
[ct=1370.574] ACTION AND THEN YOU TAKE SHOTS
[ct=1371.279] DOWNFIELD.
[ct=1375.400] AL: 2.5 LEFT IN THE QUARTER,
[ct=1377.480] THIRD DOWN AND 4.
[ct=1385.749] TO THE 48 YARD LINE,
[ct=1386.027] THAT'S DOTSON WHO CAME OVER FROM
[ct=1386.556] WASHINGTON A COUPLE YEARS AGO.
[ct=1389.096] DRAFTED IN THE FIRST ROUND.
[ct=1393.271] KIRK: JALEN HURTS CAN GO RIGHT
[ct=1395.086] OR LEFT, YOU SAW THE SOFT
[ct=1398.674] COVERAGE HE HAD TO THROW UP YOUR
[ct=1399.846] BERKELEY COMES IN AS A ROOKIE.
[ct=1403.318] ANGIE BROWN WITH MOVEMENT, SITS
[ct=1403.956] IN THE OPEN SPOT AND HE'S ALONE.
[ct=1407.114] IF YOU HAPPEN TO LOOK LEFT,
[ct=1407.635] THAT'S A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1410.524] SOFT COVERAGE AGAINST THE ROOKIE
[ct=1411.162] CORNER AND IT DOESN'T WORK OUT.
[ct=1416.806] AL: BRADEN MANN, HIS SECOND
[ct=1417.107] PUNT.
[ct=1418.920] FIRST WAS 38 YARDS.
[ct=1423.480] HE'S BACK THERE, DRIFTING.
[ct=1430.107] FALLS TO THE EIGHT YARD LINE.
[ct=1431.576] 18 WITH A FLAG DOWN.
[ct=1443.274] ADRIAN HILL WILL CHECK WITH HIS
[ct=1444.707] COHORT.
[ct=1449.000] AS WE MOVE ALONG, THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=1449.500] COORDINATOR.
[ct=1464.292] HOW WAS THAT?
[ct=1465.720] [LAUGHTER]
[ct=1471.293] KIRK: TEAMWORK.

[ct=1504.206] FROM THE END ZONE, LOOKING,

[ct=1519.577] MAY SEE HIM GRIMACE IN PAIN,
[ct=1521.110] HE'S CONTINUING TO PLAY FROM THE
[ct=1522.942] INJURY HE SUFFERED AGAINST
[ct=1525.649] CAROLINA.
[ct=1527.855] YOU SEE HIM JUST BEFORE THIS
[ct=1530.250] DRIVE, THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL
[ct=1531.190] LAYER OF PROTECTION HE IS
[ct=1533.616] WEARING, CARBON FIBER PAD.
[ct=1536.654] HE'S BEEN TELLING US THERE ARE

[ct=1544.935] GIVE IT TO ECKLER AND ECKLER
[ct=1549.497] BOUNCING HIS WAY TO ABOUT THE 11
[ct=1553.706] KIRK: THEY CONTINUE TO GO WITH
[ct=1555.195] THE TWO BACKS IN THE BACKYARD,
[ct=1556.607] THEY'VE DONE THAT MORE THAN
[ct=1560.230] ANYONE IN THE ENTIRE NFL THIS
[ct=1561.025] EUROPE YOU ALREADY USING EIGHT
[ct=1561.465] OF THE NINE SNAPS.
[ct=1565.657] GIVE HIM ANOTHER WEAPON WHEN YOU

[ct=1573.432] AL: THIRD AND 5.
[ct=1576.064] ECKLER IN THE BACKFIELD WITH
[ct=1578.183] DANIELS.
[ct=1584.504] SHOWING BLITZ OF BACK.
[ct=1586.351] DANIELS WILL RUN.
[ct=1592.643] TAKEN DOWN AT THE 11 YARD LINE.
[ct=1598.238] FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=1602.887] KIRK: HE'S PLAYING A SPY BUT
[ct=1607.018] ALSO AWARE OF FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1610.055] WHILE HE'S HERE, HE PLAYED
[ct=1611.257] AGAINST THE QUARTERBACK AT THE
[ct=1613.958] SEC, HE WAS AT GEORGIA AND LSU,
[ct=1615.770] AND HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S CAPABLE
[ct=1616.676] OF DOING AND RIGHT WHERE HE
[ct=1618.991] NEEDS TO BE ON THIRD DOWN.
[ct=1621.057] AL: HIS SECOND PUNT.
[ct=1624.318] HIS FIRST ONE WAS 51 YARDS.
[ct=1631.900] COMING UP, MAKING THE GRAB AND
[ct=1633.538] ON THE RUN AT THE 45 YARD LINE.
[ct=1639.688] AGAIN WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT
[ct=1642.750] ABOUT WASHINGTON, NOT ONLY HAVE
[ct=1643.935] THEY MADE THESE MOVES, NEW HEAD
[ct=1646.873] COACH, BUT ALMOST EVERY MOVE
[ct=1650.063] THEY'VE MADE HAS BROUGHT A LOT
[ct=1650.592] OF CREDIBILITY.
[ct=1655.356] KIRK: THEY KNEW WITH WHAT THEY
[ct=1655.599] INHERITED THINGS HAD A CHANGE
[ct=1657.012] GOOD THEY WENT THROUGH THE YEAR
[ct=1659.083] LAST YEAR, HIRED A GREAT COACH
[ct=1659.554] AND CHANGE THE CULTURE.
[ct=1662.244] I THINK PICKING UP JAYDEN
[ct=1663.456] DANIELS YOU KNOW WHAT THAT DOES
[ct=1665.370] YOU GET A QUARTERBACK YOUR
[ct=1666.242] ENTIRE FRANCHISE BELIEVES IN.
[ct=1669.487] THEY SAY BEHIND CLOSED DOORS HOW
[ct=1671.620] HE TREATS EVERYBODY HAS BEEN
[ct=1671.620] ALSO A GAME CHANGER.
[ct=1673.565] IT'S NOT JUST WHAT HE DOES ON
[ct=1673.944] THE FIELD.
[ct=1677.145] AL: THREE YEARS AT A AS YOU
[ct=1679.865] STATE INTO THAN TWO AT LSU.
[ct=1683.693] A LITTLE BIT OF EXPERIENCE.
[ct=1688.647] BERKELEY BEHIND.
[ct=1690.962] JALEN HURTS.
[ct=1696.083] SAQUON WILL TAKE IT AND END THE
[ct=1696.083] FIRST QUARTER.
[ct=1703.475] IT IS THE END 7-2 COMING IN
[ct=1704.091] AGAINST THE BROWNS.
[ct=1708.131] A VERY TIGHT RACE IN THE AFC
[ct=1708.929] NORTH.
[ct=1711.732] THEY ARE TRYING TO STAY IN THE
[ct=1711.732] TOP.
[ct=1714.924] PITTSBURGH AND CLEVELAND, ALWAYS
[ct=1716.470] A GREAT RIVALRY, NEXT THURSDAY
[ct=1716.470] NIGHT.
[ct=1719.691] SECOND DOWN AND 3 AS WE START
[ct=1720.337] THE SECOND QUARTER.
[ct=1725.471] FROM THE 41-YARD LINE.
[ct=1729.838] SAQUON BARKLEY TURNS AND BACK.
[ct=1734.039] HE'S CARRIED EIGHT TIMES FOR 29.
[ct=1737.731] THIRD AND 1.
[ct=1742.810] KIRK: I TELL YOU FRANKIE LUVU
[ct=1748.097] COMING FROM CAROLINA, HE DOES SO
[ct=1748.590] MUCH IN HIS DAN QUINN DEFENSE
[ct=1750.039] THAT HE MAKES PLAYS LIKE THAT
[ct=1750.638] AGAINST A RUN, THEY BLITZED HIM
[ct=1752.675] OFF THE EDGE, LINE HIM UP ON
[ct=1753.617] THIRD DOWN, JUST A BUNCH.
[ct=1756.206] KEEP AN EYE ON 4 TONIGHT.
[ct=1758.880] AL: THEY WILL HAVE TO PUSH
[ct=1759.664] INSTEAD.
[ct=1762.145] IT IS SAQUON BARKLEY.
[ct=1764.441] PICKS UP A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1767.126] KIRK: A GOOD CHANGE OF, ANY TIME
[ct=1770.954] THEY CAN IN THE FORMATION, HE
[ct=1772.172] SAYS IT IS GOING TO WORK AND A
[ct=1772.420] QUICK FLIP TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=1777.289] IF THE DEFENSE OVER COMMITS AND
[ct=1778.426] PINCHES INTO THE OUTSIDE TO
[ct=1781.422] START -- STOP JALEN HURTS,
[ct=1785.388] BERKELEY -- SAQUON BARKLEY IS
[ct=1785.724] OFF TO THE RACES.
[ct=1791.834] THE EASY ROUTE THEY GO FOR THOSE
[ct=1792.063] FIRST DOWNS.
[ct=1794.868] AL: THE BLOCK FROM GUNNAR, THE
[ct=1795.714] TIGHT END.
[ct=1799.753] BROWN WIDE RIGHT.
[ct=1802.044] A LITTLE TRICKERY BUT NOTHING
[ct=1802.197] DOING.
[ct=1804.883] WAS THAT SPELLED OUT PERFECTLY.
[ct=1814.424] WE HAVE FRANKIE LUVU, NOT EVEN
[ct=1816.175] CLOSE, THAT'S A LOSS OF 14.
[ct=1819.694] KIRK: AND FEELS LIKE THE TIMING
[ct=1820.348] OF THIS HAPPENED TOO FAST.
[ct=1822.896] THE DEFENSE DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE
[ct=1824.609] TO FOLLOW SAQUON BARKLEY.
[ct=1827.669] LUVU YOU SEE BUT YOU WOULD LOVE
[ct=1831.419] TO SEE SAQUON BARKLEY TAKE SOME
[ct=1832.590] MORE STEPS TO DRAW THE DEFENSE
[ct=1834.167] TO HIM BUT IT HAPPENED SO
[ct=1834.770] QUICKLY THAT THE DEFENSE DID NOT
[ct=1836.713] HAVE A CHANCE TO REACT TO SAQUON
[ct=1839.493] BARKLEY RUNNING TO THE LEFT.
[ct=1845.598] THERE IS LUVU AGAIN MAKING A
[ct=1845.598] PLAY.
[ct=1850.618] AL: HE WILL TAKE IT TO ABOUT THE
[ct=1853.223] 42 YARD LINE, SETTING UP FOR
[ct=1854.679] THIRD AND LONG.
[ct=1857.334] KIRK: JOE WHITCOMB OF THE
[ct=1858.795] DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, A LOT OF
[ct=1867.363] TIMES HAS OFFENSE IN THE PITS,
[ct=1869.222] IT HAS ALLOWED HIM TO SIT BACK
[ct=1873.811] AND PLAYING MORE COVERAGE.
[ct=1873.811] NOT HAVING TO BLITZ.
[ct=1876.778] THE GOAL TONIGHT FOR THE
[ct=1879.394] COMMANDERS IS TO TRY TO PROTECT
[ct=1879.911] THEIR CORNERS AS MUCH AS THEY
[ct=1880.872] CAN AND THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO
[ct=1881.615] THAT SO FAR TONIGHT.
[ct=1884.672] AL: IN THE BACKFIELD, PHILLY
[ct=1886.246] ONLY AVERAGING THREE YARDS PER
[ct=1890.715] THAT IS CAUGHT BUT TAKEN DOWN.
[ct=1896.228] HE GETS THE BALL INTO FIELD GOAL
[ct=1896.471] RANGE.
[ct=1901.866] LINE OF SCRIMMAGE IS GOING TO BE
[ct=1901.866] 33.
[ct=1906.254] YOU HAVE AN ATTEMPT BY ELLIOTT
[ct=1908.134] WHO HAS NOT MADE A 50 YARD FIELD
[ct=1909.524] GOAL THIS SEASON.
[ct=1913.573] THIS ONE FROM 51.
[ct=1918.960] MR. EARLIER FROM 44 -- MISSED
[ct=1921.834] EARLIER FROM 44.
[ct=1925.684] CAN HE MAKE IT FROM 51?
[ct=1928.537] KICK ON THE WAY.
[ct=1930.094] NOPE.
[ct=1932.722] 0-2.
[ct=1940.903] IT REMAINS 7-0.
[ct=1945.168] AL: THE TWO LINEBACKERS FOR
[ct=1946.257] PHILLY DEFENSE HAS BEEN A STORY
[ct=1946.608] ALL YEAR.
[ct=1950.014] WE TALK ABOUT ZACK BAUN COMING
[ct=1950.014] FROM NEW ORLEANS AND MOVING INTO
[ct=1951.079] THE LINEBACKER SPOT.
[ct=1954.605] HASN'T PLAYED A LOT IN THIS
[ct=1955.056] POSITION SO HE'S BEEN A MAJOR
[ct=1956.884] ADDITION.
[ct=1963.139] THIS GUY, WATCHING HIM AND
[ct=1964.820] GEORGE, ONE OF THE BEST LEADERS
[ct=1965.140] I'VE SEEN.
[ct=1968.822] THOSE TWO HAVE MADE A BIG
[ct=1969.106] DIFFERENCE FOR THE EAGLES
[ct=1969.479] DEFENSE.
[ct=1972.631] AL: THE TWO TOP TACKLERS ON THE
[ct=1974.186] TEAM.
[ct=1980.570] LOOK OUT.
[ct=1983.024] SPENDS.
[ct=1987.224] DOWN AT THE 37 WITH YARD LINE --
[ct=1987.716] THE 37 YARD LINE.
[ct=1994.394] BRANDON WITH YEARS IN THE
[ct=1997.572] LEAGUE, NUMBER ONE DRAFT PICK IN
[ct=1997.572] 2010.
[ct=2002.497] KIRK: WITH HIS ATHLETIC ABILITY,
[ct=2003.717] TRYING TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF
[ct=2005.807] IT, INSTEAD OF TAKING A LOSS BIT
[ct=2009.961] EVERYBODY TAKING AWAY WHICH
[ct=2011.957] ALLOWED GRAHAM TO GET HOME.
[ct=2017.444] AL: SECOND AND 14.
[ct=2019.658] UNDER PRESSURE AGAIN.
[ct=2023.546] SWUNG DOWN TO THE 29 YARD LINE.
[ct=2026.434] JOSH SWEAT.
[ct=2029.326] WORKING UP SOME SWEAT.
[ct=2035.255] KIRK: HECK OF A BATTLE, NOT JUST
[ct=2035.910] WHEN THE COMMANDERS ARE RUNNING.
[ct=2038.849] WHEN THEY HAVE TO PROTECT THEIR
[ct=2039.519] QUARTERBACK.
[ct=2042.455] LAST WAS A COVERAGE SACK AND
[ct=2043.874] THIS TIME JALEN CARTER FORCES
[ct=2044.283] IT.
[ct=2048.434] WATCH THE MOVE, THE CLUB, AND HE
[ct=2049.606] HAS QUICKNESS TO AFFECT THAT
[ct=2050.371] QUARTERBACK AND MAKE SOME STEP
[ct=2050.689] AWAY.
[ct=2053.272] THE TANDEM WITH SWEAT TO GET THE
[ct=2053.530] SACK.
[ct=2057.341] AL: BROUGHT THE CROWD TO LIFE ON
[ct=2059.811] THIRD AND 22.
[ct=2065.262] KEEP IT ON THE GROUND.
[ct=2069.558] ROBINSON STOPPING AT THE 35 WITH
[ct=2070.935] A FLAG DOWN.
[ct=2074.969] TWO FLAGS ARE DOWN.
[ct=2082.924] >> PENALTY IS DECLINED, FOURTH
[ct=2083.325] DOWN.
[ct=2086.437] KIRK: THAT IS THEIR PLAN
[ct=2092.226] GET JAKE BEHIND THE STICKS,
[ct=2094.656] DON'T LET HIS CREATIVITY HAVE AN
[ct=2095.114] IMPACT ON THE GAME, KEEP THEM IN
[ct=2095.699] THE POCKET.
[ct=2101.558] YOU SEE SWEAT PLAYING OFF JALEN
[ct=2102.211] CARTER.
[ct=2107.402] AL: PITTSBURGH DID THAT LAST
[ct=2107.689] WEEK AND HAD A GREAT JOB OF IT.
[ct=2110.768] HERE IS SWEAT, HIS THIRD KICK OF
[ct=2111.078] THE NIGHT.
[ct=2117.653] GOING TO LET IT GO, SWIMS OUT OF
[ct=2118.299] BOUNDS AT THE 26 YARD LINE.
[ct=2124.363] 51 TO THE HAVEHE WILL GO DOWN IN
[ct=2129.669] MEMORY FOREVER WITH THAT SECOND
[ct=2130.992] THE SUPER BOWL.
[ct=2133.328] THE EAGLES, THIS FIELD GOAL IN A
[ct=2134.377] COUPLE OF PUNTS AND ANOTHER.
[ct=2136.577] THIS THREE-POINT ATTEMPT.
[ct=2140.400] FROM THEIR OWN 26 YARD LINE.
[ct=2147.002] 25 PLAYS FOR 86 YARDS.
[ct=2154.626] SECOND AND FOUR.
[ct=2156.615] KIRK: TALKING TO JALEN HURTS
[ct=2164.942] WHEN THE EAGLES HAVE HURT
[ct=2165.599] THEMSELVES, SOME DROPS, SOME
[ct=2167.675] MISSED FIELD GOALS, THE HOLDING
[ct=2167.675] CALL.
[ct=2169.606] LOSING ECKLER.
[ct=2177.170] THEY STARTED IN TRICK TERRITORY
[ct=2178.370] AND A LOT HAS GONE AGAINST THEM
[ct=2178.982] AND SOME OF THEIR OWN DOING.
[ct=2182.320] AL: THE ONE BIG PLAY, 25 YARD
[ct=2183.336] RECEPTION BY BROWN.
[ct=2190.412] BARKELY THROUGH THE MIDDLE AND
[ct=2191.105] NOTHING HAPPENING FOR SAQUON.
[ct=2194.580] OF COURSE THE GIANT FANS ARE OUT
[ct=2196.847] OF THEIR MINDS, THE FACT THAT
[ct=2198.289] BARKELY WAS LET GO.
[ct=2203.742] SO MUCH OF IT WAS PLAYED OUT ON
[ct=2205.240] THE HARD KNOCKS SHOW.
[ct=2208.010] BEHIND THE SCENE.
[ct=2210.611] KIRK: WATCHING THAT AND I THINK
[ct=2213.448] IF YOU KNOW SAQUON BARKLEY, HE
[ct=2215.020] SEEMED TO HAVE IT STARTED RIGHT
[ct=2216.371] THERE, A CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER.
[ct=2220.540] I THINK HE CAME TO PHILADELPHIA,
[ct=2221.808] FELT LOVED, FELT THEY BELIEVED
[ct=2223.311] IN HIM AND IT HAS A LOT TO DO
[ct=2227.568] WITH THE NEWFOUND CONFIDENCE
[ct=2227.932] THAT MAYBE HAS BEEN MISSING THE
[ct=2228.279] LEFT COUPLE OF YEARS.
[ct=2232.327] AL: THIRD AND 4.
[ct=2235.713] THROWING, INCOMPLETE, RUSHER PUT
[ct=2235.713] UP.
[ct=2239.135] -- PRESSURE PUT UP.
[ct=2247.616] KIRK: IF YOU ARE A PHILLY FAN
[ct=2247.985] YOU ARE THINKING THIS WILL BE A
[ct=2248.181] COMPLETION.
[ct=2252.285] NOT ONLY IS A GIBRAN YOU BUT
[ct=2252.667] DEFENDER FAULTS.
[ct=2258.085] THAT'S A SAFETY, JEREMY CHINN,
[ct=2259.019] IF HE FELT ON HE CAN STAY WITH
[ct=2259.019] AG BROWN.
[ct=2262.779] RIGHT NOW THERE IS RHYTHM TO THE
[ct=2262.779] OFFENSE.
[ct=2266.110] JALEN HURTS IS A STREAKY
[ct=2270.128] QUARTERBACK, HE CAN GO AND CATCH
[ct=2270.593] FIRE BUT THEY ARE SEARCHING FOR
[ct=2271.279] THE RHYTHM.
[ct=2277.309] AL: NOT CAUGHT, A TWO YARD RUN.
[ct=2279.876] THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK
[ct=2280.138] WITH HERTZ.
[ct=2282.935] -- JALEN HURTS.
[ct=2285.334] THE NUMBER ONE SPOT ON THE
[ct=2285.988] HOLIDAY CHARTS THIS WEEK.
[ct=2289.247] AL: IF HE SHOWS UP CAROLING IN
[ct=2292.025] YOUR FRONT YARD, ARE YOU GOING
[ct=2293.512] TO CALL --
[ct=2303.266] BACK TO THE 31 YARD LINE.
[ct=2313.495] IT IS COMING, I PROMISE YOU.
[ct=2318.384] HE MAY BE IN THE BACK OF SOME --
[ct=2319.445] HE'S SWEET RIGHT NOW.
[ct=2324.210] SECOND DOWN AND 6.
[ct=2327.818] ROBINSON IS THE BACK.
[ct=2333.247] WORKING HIS WAY TO TACKLES.
[ct=2337.538] FIRST DOWN UP TO THE 30 YARD
[ct=2338.086] LINE.
[ct=2344.247] KIRK: THERE'S A LOT OF PRE-SLAP
[ct=2344.657] AND MOTION THAT AFFECTS THE EYES
[ct=2346.917] OF THE LINEBACKERS AND CREATES A
[ct=2347.499] LITTLE HESITATION.
[ct=2350.785] WHEN YOU MIX IN THE POWER INSIDE
[ct=2352.762] RUN WITH ROBINSON BACK HEALTHY,
[ct=2354.065] IT'S A LOT FOR THESE BACKERS TO
[ct=2354.818] DEAL WITH.
[ct=2358.243] AL: ROLLING, THROWING, CAUGHT,
[ct=2359.520] OPEN ROBINSON.
[ct=2361.211] FIGHTS HIS WAY THROUGH.
[ct=2366.904] TACKLED IN BOUNDS BY COOPER.
[ct=2369.859] KIRK: HE STOOD A GOOD JOB OF
[ct=2371.323] TAKING RECEIVERS AWAY IN THE
[ct=2371.592] FIRST HALF.
[ct=2375.067] MOST OF THE PASSES HAVE BEEN
[ct=2375.546] AGAINST THE LINEBACKERS IN
[ct=2375.546] COVERAGE.
[ct=2377.774] IN TIME WE’
[ct=2379.273] IN TIME WE'VE SEEN EVERETT IN
[ct=2380.929] THE BACKFIELD AND THIS TIME
[ct=2381.703] ROBINSON, THERE IS KELCE.
[ct=2389.161] AL: TRYING OUT FOR FLEETWOOD MAC
[ct=2391.273] I GUESS WITH STEVIE NICKS.
[ct=2393.427] KIRK: WHAT CAN'T HE DO?
[ct=2398.667] AL: SECOND AND 1, ECKLER TO THE
[ct=2399.483] OUTSIDE AND TURNS HER BACK,
[ct=2401.317] TAKES IT TO THE 50 YARD LINE.
[ct=2412.299] AGAINST -- WINNING AGAINST
[ct=2418.017] KIRK: ANYTIME YOU RUN OUTSIDE
[ct=2418.611] THERE'S USUALLY A HOLD ON THE
[ct=2418.943] EDGE.
[ct=2423.577] >> HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER TWO.
[ct=2426.406] AL: THAT IS BROWN ON THE
[ct=2426.800] OUTSIDE.
[ct=2430.301] KIRK: A LOT OF THESE CORNERBACKS
[ct=2430.659] HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF GETTING
[ct=2433.335] THEMSELVES READY, JAELON DANIELS
[ct=2434.903] TELLING US HE IS THE BEST
[ct=2437.538] BASKETBALL PLAYER ON THE TEAM,
[ct=2438.220] HE'S DONE THIS SINCE HIGH
[ct=2438.220] SCHOOL.
[ct=2441.009] I'M SURE ONE OF HIS COACHES OVER
[ct=2442.448] THE YEARS TOLD HIM ABOUT THIS,
[ct=2444.039] HE SAYS HE DOES A BUNCH OF
[ct=2444.459] DIFFERENT MOVEMENTS AND THINGS.
[ct=2447.315] BY THE TIME HE'S DONE WITH MAYBE
[ct=2449.614] A 10 OR 15 MINUTE WORKOUT WITH
[ct=2450.439] THE BASKETBALL, HE SAID THE
[ct=2450.957] FOOTBALL FEELS LIKE IT IS PEEWEE
[ct=2454.840] BALL IN HIS HANDS.
[ct=2457.790] AL: THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE
[ct=2459.264] HIM IN THE SIXERS.
[ct=2464.088] SECOND AND 10 FROM THE 38 YARD
[ct=2472.406] IN THE POCKET.
[ct=2473.707] THROWS TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=2476.168] ECKLER.
[ct=2480.628] INSIDE AND OUT HE GOES, THIRD
[ct=2482.270] DOWN AND 5.
[ct=2484.920] KIRK: A BIG QUESTION THIS YEAR
[ct=2485.578] IS HOW GOOD WITH THE SECONDARY
[ct=2487.363] BE FOR PHILADELPHIA?
[ct=2490.695] THEY GOT THE TWO ROOKIES,
[ct=2494.085] MITCHELL FROM TOLEDO IN RIGHT
[ct=2496.148] CORNER, AND COOPER TO JANE, IN
[ct=2497.651] THE NICKEL SPOT.
[ct=2501.304] WENT FROM BEING A QUESTION MARK
[ct=2502.025] TO SOLIDIFYING HIM ON THE BACK
[ct=2502.213] AND.
[ct=2514.020] THROWS AND THE OLD EAGLE
[ct=2514.311] HIMSELF, ZACH ERTZ, EIGHT YEARS

[ct=2516.992] COUPLE SEASONS.
[ct=2521.226] NOW IN HIS 12TH YEAR, A BIG HERO
[ct=2521.226] IN THIS TOWN.
[ct=2524.623] KIRK: I KNOW HE'S FIRED UP TO BE
[ct=2525.118] BACK, LOOK AT THE SOFT COVERAGE.
[ct=2527.549] A BIG TIGHT END AGAINST THE
[ct=2530.131] ROOKIE MITCHELL, ON 30 SHORT,
[ct=2532.070] GIVING HIM A LOT OF ROOM OFF THE
[ct=2532.351] LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=2534.623] GOOD RECOGNITION BY DANIELS WITH
[ct=2537.512] A PRE-SNAP FIELD.
[ct=2541.488] ONE OF HIS FAVORITE TARGETS,
[ct=2542.026] ABLE TO GET IT TO HIM ON THE
[ct=2542.313] PERIMETER.
[ct=2544.479] AL: FIVE MINUTES LEFT IN THE
[ct=2544.766] HALF.
[ct=2546.596] ROLLING LEFT.
[ct=2549.710] DANIELS CHOOSING TO KEEP IT.
[ct=2553.070] MAKING SURE HE DOESN'T GO ANY
[ct=2553.548] FURTHER.
[ct=2562.599] SECOND DOWN.
[ct=2569.946] KIRK: AFTER THE LOSS TO
[ct=2570.156] PITTSBURGH, HE TEXTED JAYDEN
[ct=2573.308] DANIELS, WE WILL GET THIS THING
[ct=2575.029] GOING, AND THEY'VE BEEN
[ct=2575.198] PROTECTING HIM FROM RUNNING THE
[ct=2578.735] COACH, YOU NEED LET ME GO, IT'S
[ct=2580.831] BEEN FOUR WEEKS, LET ME START
[ct=2582.173] RUNNING THE BALL AND HE LIKES
[ct=2582.891] THAT RESPONSE.
[ct=2585.205] AL: THAT WAS NOT CAUGHT.
[ct=2591.051] PAST A LITTLE LOW, NOAH BROWN.
[ct=2595.955] FOREVER REMEMBERED BY COMMANDERS
[ct=2597.947] FANS FOR MAKING THE CATCH IN THE
[ct=2598.477] MIRACLE PLAY AGAINST CHICAGO A
[ct=2599.043] COUPLE WEEKS BACK.
[ct=2605.833] KIRK: HE HAS A, GREAT JOB, STILL
[ct=2607.120] ON THE OUTSIDE, WORKS ACROSS THE
[ct=2608.790] FIELD, GREAT SEPARATION, TO THE
[ct=2620.959] AL: GOOD BOUNCE PASS, THIRD AND
[ct=2620.959] NINE.
[ct=2624.468] THE LEADING RECEIVER.
[ct=2631.612] DROP BY ECKLER.
[ct=2635.134] HE'S NORMALLY SUREHANDED AND HE
[ct=2638.120] DROPS THAT ONE FOR THE 9.
[ct=2641.132] KIRK: SECOND ARTS DOES A GOOD
[ct=2644.462] JOB OF GETTING -- ZACH ERTZ DOES
[ct=2645.471] A GOOD JOB OF GETTING IN THE
[ct=2645.831] DEFENDER.
[ct=2651.428] WITH THAT LITTLE RUB BY ERTZ,
[ct=2651.824] THERE'S ENOUGH RAIN TO CATCH THE
[ct=2653.804] FOOTBALL AND RUN TO THE CORNER
[ct=2654.633] TO PICK UP A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2659.988] AL: THIS IS THE SEVENTH PUNT OF
[ct=2661.506] THE HALF.
[ct=2667.560] MADE A FAIR CATCH AT THE 10 YARD
[ct=2672.251] KIRK: YOU DIDN'T SEE THE SPIN,
[ct=2672.251] THE BLIND HURDLE.
[ct=2675.736] AL: HIS BODY JUST TOOK OVER.
[ct=2680.139] FROM THE 10 YARD LINE, THE
[ct=2680.783] EAGLES TRYING TO GET SOMETHING
[ct=2681.217] GOING.
[ct=2684.308] STARTING WITH A PASS TO THE
[ct=2686.871] OUTSIDE, TRYING TO PICK UP THE
[ct=2688.421] FIRST DOWN IS BARKLEY.
[ct=2693.021] KAYLEE: I THINK WE ALL GOOD --
[ct=2695.903] GOT A GOOD LAUGH OUT OF IT WHEN
[ct=2697.061] NICK SIRIANNI TOLD US HIS KID
[ct=2699.797] WAS WATCHING THE GAME AND SAYING
[ct=2700.508] WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT.
[ct=2701.092] BUT HIS BROTHER, A FOOTBALL
[ct=2704.822] COACH, HAD TO TELL THE KIDS, YOU
[ct=2704.822] DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO
[ct=2707.557] WHAT SAQUON DID, DON'T TRY THAT.
[ct=2711.873] AL: DON'T TRY THAT UNLESS YOU
[ct=2713.271] CAN TRY OUT FOR THE GYMNASTICS
[ct=2714.480] TEAM AT THE OLYMPICS.
[ct=2723.002] BARKLEY, PICKS UP THE FIRST
[ct=2726.689] CLOCKS ROLLING.
[ct=2729.577] >> Kirk: A LOT OF TIMES WHEN
[ct=2731.235] FANS ARE AT HOME WATCHING,
[ct=2732.425] WATCHING THE BALL, WATCHING THE
[ct=2734.929] IF YOU’RE A FAN OF DEFENSE AND
[ct=2736.885] ESPECIALLY INSTINCTS AND WISDOM,
[ct=2739.589] JUST WATCH 54 PRE-SNAP, AND HOW
[ct=2740.025] MUCH HE’S COMMUNICATE
[ct=2741.190] COMMUNICATING AND TRYING TO MAKE
[ct=2743.035] SURE EVERYBODY’S SEEING WHAT
[ct=2744.490] HE’S SEEING IT.
[ct=2746.182] >> Al: DONE IT FOR 13 YEARS.
[ct=2749.192] AND THAT PASS IS CONTESTED, BUT
[ct=2751.904] BROWN IS ABLE TO MAKE THE CATCH.
[ct=2755.338] FORWARD PROGRESS.
[ct=2755.887] A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2756.162] IT IS.
[ct=2758.578] >> Kirk: GOOD JOB BY BARKLEY.
[ct=2760.124] THIS TIME EHE HAD TO TAKE ON A
[ct=2762.035] BLOCK.
[ct=2763.816] YOU SAW HURTS GET HIT.
[ct=2765.117] IT’S BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE
[ct=2768.964] FROM LUVU BARKLEY HAS TO DO HIS
[ct=2769.967] BEST TO TAKE ON.
[ct=2772.554] HE DID HIS JOB BECAUSE HURTS HAD
[ct=2774.058] JUST ENOUGH TIME AS YOU SAID,
[ct=2775.655] AL, TO THROW IT AND MAKE THE
[ct=2777.515] CATCH.
[ct=2779.601] >> Al: JUST ENOUGH YARDAGE TO
[ct=2781.915] PICK UP THE FIRST.
[ct=2784.194] SMITH TACKLED BY JEREMY CHINN.
[ct=2786.936] SHORT GAIN.
[ct=2791.087] 2nd DOWN AND 7 AFTER THIS THREE.
[ct=2792.402] >> Kirk: NOT DOMINATING THE LINE
[ct=2794.458] OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=2795.842] IF IT COMES A GAME MAYBE YOU
[ct=2797.881] HAVE TO THROW MORE, TRY TO
[ct=2799.020] SOFTEN UP THE COVERAGE AND TRY
[ct=2802.097] TO SOFTEN UP THE DEFENSIVE
[ct=2805.059] FRONT, MAYBE YOU THROW TONIGHT
[ct=2805.296] AGAINST THIS COMMANDERS DEFENSE
[ct=2806.439] THAT’S SETUP TO RUN.
[ct=2810.799] SEARCHING FOR RHYTHM.
[ct=2811.094] >> Al: BROWN.
[ct=2818.149] TO BARKLEY, BREAKING TACKLES TO
[ct=2819.476] THE 49 YARD LINE.
[ct=2824.065] >> Kirk: LOOK AT HIS SUPER
[ct=2825.071] POWER, THAT SPIN MOVE.
[ct=2827.256] TOUGH ON THE DEFENSE.
[ct=2830.028] >> Al: 2 MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=2830.355] 7-0, COMMANDERS.L TRYING TO
[ct=2835.693] REPAIR THE CRACK IN THE LIBERTY
[ct=2840.159] BALL, BUT WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?
[ct=2841.841] >> Kirk: LOOK AT SHERM.
[ct=2843.385] WHY?
[ct=2844.904] >> Al: FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2846.052] HERE’S BARKLEY.
[ct=2846.824] TO THE 48 YARD LINE.
[ct=2850.538] SO A HEAVY DOSE OF HIM.
[ct=2854.767] 13 FOR 53.
[ct=2857.488] BY THE WAY, THAT WAS THE LIBERTY
[ct=2858.136] BELL NOT THE LIBERTY BALL.
[ct=2866.778] ALL OF THEIR TIMEOUTS REMAIN FOR
[ct=2868.092] BOTH TEAMS.
[ct=2869.572] AT THE 48 YARD LINE.
[ct=2870.838] FIRED OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=2873.244] IT’S CAUGHT BY DAVANTE SMITH.
[ct=2876.800] AND HE WORKS HIS WAY DOWN THE 25
[ct=2884.061] CAUGHT.
[ct=2887.567] >> Kirk: A LITTLE SHAKE AND OFF.
[ct=2889.327] HE DOES SUCH A NICE JOB.
[ct=2890.842] GREAT ROUTE RUNNER, BUT
[ct=2891.930] EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH WHEN YOU
[ct=2893.652] LOOK AT HIS BUILD.
[ct=2896.352] >> Al: 21 YARD GAIN.
[ct=2897.701] CLOCK KEEPS ON MOVING.
[ct=2901.630] UNDER A MINUTE NOW.
[ct=2905.364] FLAG DOWN AT THE 24 YARD LINE.
[ct=2915.842] ADRIAN HILL GOING TO MAKE THE
[ct=2916.460] CALL HERE.
[ct=2918.501] A LITTLE ACTION GOING ON THE
[ct=2920.361] SIDE WITH THE TEAMS.
[ct=2922.535] NOTHING MAJOR.
[ct=2932.451] >> Referee: ILLEGAL CONTACT
[ct=2933.813] DEFENSE NUMBER 0.
[ct=2936.472] 5 YARD PENALTY WILL BE ADDED AS
[ct=2937.820] A RESULT OF THE PLAY, AUTOMATIC
[ct=2947.488] >> Al: AND THAT WILL MOVE THE
[ct=2952.625] BALL TO 58 SECONDS.
[ct=2953.973] TRYING TO SPOT IT RIGHT NOW.
[ct=2958.090] THEY PUT IT AT THE 20.
[ct=2966.142] SO A FIRST DOWN AT THE 20 YARD
[ct=2977.131] DOTSON IN MOTION.
[ct=2984.095] SAQUON PICKS UP TWO.
[ct=2986.181] AND FINALLY A TIMEOUT IS TAKEN
[ct=2991.815] WITH 51 SECONDS.
[ct=2992.852] TAKEN BY WASHINGTON TO CONSERVE
[ct=2996.202] A LITTLE TIME.
[ct=2998.940] >> Kirk: THEY DEFER TO OPEN THIS
[ct=3000.675] GAME UP SO THEY DO GET THE BALL
[ct=3001.734] TO START THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=3005.529] >> Al: SO BALL AT THE 18 YARD
[ct=3008.416] SO THIS DRIVE NOW STARTED AT
[ct=3010.555] THEIR OWN 10.
[ct=3011.451] BY FAR THEIR BEST DRIVE OF THE
[ct=3014.822] 72 YARDS, 9 PLAYS.
[ct=3016.172] ELLIOTT HOPING THAT HE COMES IN
[ct=3017.879] FOR AN EXTRA POINT AND NOT A
[ct=3019.561] FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT.
[ct=3020.915] >> Kirk: AND REMEMBER WITH JALEN
[ct=3022.382] HURTS, YOU SAW IT LAST WEEK
[ct=3024.534] AGAINST DALLAS.
[ct=3025.803] THREE RED ZONE INTERCEPTIONS
[ct=3025.991] THIS SEASON.
[ct=3027.587] THAT’S TIED FOR THE MOST WITH
[ct=3029.792] DANIEL JONES AND SAM DARNOLD, SO
[ct=3031.311] DON’T WANT TO FEEL THAT HE HAS
[ct=3033.120] TO MAKE A PLAY AND FORCE A THROW
[ct=3043.567] DOWN IN THIS AREA.
[ct=3046.031] >> Al: BROWN TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=3047.112] BROWN COMES IN MOTION TO THE
[ct=3050.647] INSIDE.
[ct=3052.021] HURTS WILL GO TO THE END ZONE,
[ct=3055.775] AND IT’S BROKEN UP IN THE END
[ct=3056.813] ZONE.
[ct=3060.792] AGAIN THAT’S SAINRISTIL CALLED
[ct=3061.920] FOR THE PENALTY ON THE LAST
[ct=3064.919] >> Kirk: HE PLAYED RECEIVER IN
[ct=3065.455] MICHIGAN.
[ct=3069.617] I THINK HE HAD SOME INSTINCTS.
[ct=3070.050] HERE HE IS AGAINST DVONTAYE
[ct=3072.671] SMITH, A LITTLE STUTTER AND GO,
[ct=3073.499] IN POSITION THERE.
[ct=3075.233] WHAT I LOVE ABOUT HIM AS A YOUNG
[ct=3076.669] CORNER HE’S ABLE TO LOCATE THE
[ct=3077.738] FOOTBALL AND PLAY ON THE BALL
[ct=3080.262] AND KNOCK IT AWAY.
[ct=3082.941] >> Al: ROOKIE PICKED IN THE
[ct=3083.126] SECOND ROUND.
[ct=3091.106] 3rd DOWN AND 8.
[ct=3095.805] FOUR-MAN RUSH.
[ct=3096.878] ERTZ SIGNALING, SAYING BLOCK
[ct=3098.882] ME.
[ct=3102.569] GET THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3105.261] GAINWELL LED THE WAY.
[ct=3106.990] >> Kirk: THIS IS THE DANGER BY
[ct=3107.845] ARMSTRONG.
[ct=3110.298] WHEN YOU GET UPFIELD, A LITTLE
[ct=3112.528] SPIN MOVE TAKES HIM OUT.
[ct=3113.453] AND NOW LOOK AT ALL THAT SPACE.
[ct=3115.510] AND THAT’S YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO
[ct=3116.920] AND CAN’T AFFORD TO DO BECAUSE
[ct=3118.196] THE ACCELERATION AND THE POWER
[ct=3120.266] THAT HE RUNS WITH, WHEN HE GETS
[ct=3122.176] GOING, HE COVERS A LOT OF
[ct=3122.542] GROUND.
[ct=3123.773] HE’S ABLE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE
[ct=3125.998] HE NEEDS TO GO TO PICK UP THAT
[ct=3129.575] THAT’S A CRITICAL SCRAMBLE FOR A
[ct=3133.236] FIRST DOWN THERE BY JALEN HURTS.
[ct=3137.280] >> Al: 3rd DOWN AND 8.
[ct=3141.484] 1st AND GOAL FROM THE 9.
[ct=3143.497] JALEN GOING TO KEEP IT HIMSELF.
[ct=3144.734] BREAKING TACKLES.
[ct=3148.843] AND THEY TAKE A TIMEOUT.
[ct=3153.713] SO FROM THE 4 IT’LL BE A 2nd AND
[ct=3155.612] GOAL AS THEY HAVE NOW MARCHED 86
[ct=3160.163] YARDS IN 12 PLAYS.
[ct=3164.509] 42 RUSHING FIRST DOWNS.
[ct=3167.015] >> Kirk: AS DEFENSIVE
[ct=3170.357] COORDINATOR, HIS LEGS GIVE YOU
[ct=3171.541] THAT EXTRA THOUGHT TO BE ABLE TO
[ct=3173.231] PREVENT YOU PLAYING CERTAIN
[ct=3175.053] COVERAGES BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO
[ct=3176.620] RESPECT THAT -- THAT EXTRA GAP
[ct=3179.096] ESPECIALLY DOWN IN THIS AREA.
[ct=3180.571] SO IT OPENS UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR
[ct=3182.538] HIM IN THIS PASSING GAME.
[ct=3183.669] WE’LL SEE WHAT THEY END UP DOING
[ct=3185.535] HERE TO PUNCH IT IN.
[ct=3188.614] >> Al: COULD BE A SHOOTOUT.
[ct=3190.931] EVEN THE BALTIMORE, CINCINNATI
[ct=3192.136] GAME LAST WEEK.
[ct=3193.947] >> Kirk: START SLOW.
[ct=3194.843] >> Al: AND THE SECOND HALF WAS
[ct=3195.204] CRAZY.
[ct=3196.230] ONE OF THE BEST GAMES OF THE
[ct=3197.815] SEASON.
[ct=3198.977] ANYWAY, PLAY RESUMES HERE AFTER
[ct=3200.532] THE TIMEOUT.
[ct=3202.491] 2nd DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=3205.659] 33 SECONDS.
[ct=3208.198] PHILLY STILL HAS A COUPLE OF
[ct=3211.805] TIMEOUTS IF NECESSARY.
[ct=3212.765] BARKLEY, STOOD UP AT THE 3 YARD
[ct=3213.754] PUSHED BACK.
[ct=3215.278] 3rd DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=3216.662] TIMEOUT.
[ct=3217.504] >> Kirk: DEFENSIVE LINE DOING
[ct=3218.563] THEIR JOB THERE EATING UP ALL
[ct=3220.003] THOSE BLOCKS, FREED UP THE
[ct=3221.392] BACKERS AND THE SAFETIES.
[ct=3223.160] ABLE TO CLEAN THAT UP, PREVENT
[ct=3226.287] HIM FROM GETTING INTO THE END
[ct=3236.514] THEY SLANTED, TRYING TO OCCUPY
[ct=3241.305] SPACE, EAT THOSE LINEMEN UP, TRY
[ct=3247.135] TO KEEP MARTIN FREE.
[ct=3248.517] IGBINOGHENE ABLE TO GET INVOLVED
[ct=3255.808] AND McNICHOLS, CONTACT THERE.
[ct=3257.243] AND A PASS AND THE THREAT AS WE
[ct=3259.004] SEE IN THE END ZONE.
[ct=3260.412] JALEN HURTS TAKING IT AND
[ct=3262.146] PULLING IT DOWN AND TRYING TO
[ct=3263.312] GET IT INTO THE END ZONE
[ct=3266.331] HIMSELF.
[ct=3269.923] GOEDERT WITH HIS SIZE AT 6’5".
[ct=3271.411] >> Al: THINK HE ROLLS OUT HERE?
[ct=3274.269] >> Kirk: I WOULD KEEP HIM IN THE
[ct=3277.655] MIDDLE OF THE FIELD WHERE YOU
[ct=3281.796] CAN ALLOW HIM TO STEP UP.
[ct=3288.521] >> Al: SURVEYING, LOOKING.
[ct=3290.228] HE FLIPS IT AWAY.
[ct=3292.067] GOING TO CALL IT AN INCOMPLETE
[ct=3295.847] PASS AND 4th AND GOAL.
[ct=3297.332] QUAN MARTIN PUT THE PRESSURE ON
[ct=3301.808] AND YOU’VE GOT 4th DOWN AND GOAL
[ct=3302.072] NOW.
[ct=3303.813] CROWD SENSING THE FIELD GOAL
[ct=3304.894] ATTEMPT AND NOT HAPPY RIGHT NOW.
[ct=3306.239] >> Kirk: YOU’VE GOT A COUPLE OF
[ct=3308.184] RECEIVERS THAT END UP JUST
[ct=3309.699] COMING THREE.
[ct=3312.538] MOST NOTABLY DAVANTE SMITH LOOK
[ct=3313.643] AT THE TRAFFIC.
[ct=3314.615] THEY RAN INTO EACH OTHER.
[ct=3315.470] EVENTUALLY YOU SEE OUT TO THE
[ct=3317.730] LEFT, HE’S GOT TWO GUYS ALL BY
[ct=3319.033] HIMSELF, BUT HE’S FIGHTING FOR
[ct=3319.416] HIS LIFE.
[ct=3320.857] THEY MISS A FACE MASK CALL
[ct=3323.370] LOOKS LIKE HE GATE AHOLD OF
[ct=3324.759] THAT, BUT NO CALL.
[ct=3325.857] YEAH, IF HE WOULD HAVE HAD TIME
[ct=3328.276] TO LOOK OUT THERE EVEN AFTER HE
[ct=3332.450] RAN INTO HIS OWN MAN, DVONTAYE
[ct=3333.417] SMITH STILL WORKED OUT TO THAT
[ct=3337.359] FLAG.
[ct=3339.321] >> Al: IF HE MISSES THIS ONE,
[ct=3340.876] YOU’LL HEAR A SERENADE LIKE NO
[ct=3342.224] OTHER, BUT HE DOESN’T.
[ct=3344.555] HE BANGS IT THROUGH.
[ct=3346.700] 21 YARD ATTEMPT TO CAPJUST A GRE
[ct=3354.019] >> Al: ONE OF THE BEST.
[ct=3355.785] AND THE KICK OFF.
[ct=3360.710] AND SAILS THAT ONE TO THE END
[ct=3363.570] SECONDS AT THE 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=3366.198] AND THEN WASHINGTON SINCE THEY
[ct=3368.038] WON THE TOSS AND DEFERRED, THEY
[ct=3371.279] WILL GET THE BALL WHEN WE START
[ct=3372.061] THE THIRD QUARTER.
[ct=3383.698] THEY HAVE A COUPLE OF TIMEOUTS.
[ct=3386.271] MAYBE YOU WANT TO LAUNCH
[ct=3386.271] SOMETHING HERE AND TRY TO GET IN
[ct=3389.324] FIELD GOAL RANGE.
[ct=3390.610] AT LEAST THEY LINE UP IN A
[ct=3393.380] FORMATION TO INDICATE THEY MAY
[ct=3398.222] DO THAT, GO FOUR-WIDE HERE.
[ct=3401.070] >> Kirk: DOESN’T HAVE A TARGET
[ct=3403.734] YET TONIGHT.
[ct=3405.105] >> Al: ZERO.
[ct=3406.288] THROW IT OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=3410.566] EKELER IS GOING TO GET IT TO THE
[ct=3411.668] 49 YARD LINE.
[ct=3412.092] >> Kirk: THEY CAN TAKE A
[ct=3415.186] >> Al: THEY STILL HAVE ONE
[ct=3416.494] AVAILABLE.
[ct=3419.676] 11 SECONDS.
[ct=3421.953] WELL, LAST TIME THEY WERE
[ct=3426.564] AROUND, MISSED A SPOT AT THE END
[ct=3427.598] OF IT GAME.
[ct=3429.093] YOU CAN’T FORGET IT AND NEITHER
[ct=3435.999] CAN CHICAGO.
[ct=3445.653] ALMOST INCREDIBLE PLAYS EVER.
[ct=3448.478] THERE WAS NOAH BROWN.
[ct=3449.644] >> Kirk: SAYS THANK YOU VERY
[ct=3452.275] MUCH, BEARS, EVERYBODY JUDGING
[ct=3453.152] UP THERE AT ONCE.
[ct=3454.404] I THINK IN THIS CASE YOU GOT THE
[ct=3457.359] TIMEOUT, YOU TRY TO GET IN FIELD
[ct=3458.902] GOAL RANGE.
[ct=3460.502] I DON’T THINK YOU NEED TO --
[ct=3461.997] >> Al: POSSIBLE.
[ct=3463.230] >> Kirk: YEAH, I THINK YOU GOT
[ct=3467.666] PLENTY OF TIME HERE.
[ct=3473.560] >> TO THE OUTSIDE, LUKE
[ct=3473.671] McCAFFREY.
[ct=3475.288] 2nd AND 10.
[ct=3476.902] NOW YOU’VE GOT GONZALEZ, WHO’S
[ct=3478.382] THE KICKER THEY PICKED UP LAST
[ct=3480.883] WEEK OR BROUGHT HIM TO THE
[ct=3483.707] ACTIVE ROSTER.
[ct=3486.377] ANYWAY, SEIBERT HAS BEEN HAVING
[ct=3489.109] A FANTASTIC YEAR.
[ct=3489.666] HE WAS LEADING THE LEAGUE IN
[ct=3491.580] POINTS UNTIL A COUPLE WEEKS AGO
[ct=3493.281] AND GOT A HIP INJURY THAT’S
[ct=3494.176] SHELVED HIM FOR AT LEAST TWO
[ct=3496.095] GAMES.
[ct=3497.902] SEE IF DANIELS CAN GET THEM INTO
[ct=3500.300] THAT RANGE RIGHT NOW.
[ct=3501.757] WE’VE GOT A TIMEOUT.
[ct=3502.765] >> Kirk: YEAH, PHILADELPHIA’S
[ct=3506.879] LOOKED AT THE FORMATION
[ct=3507.581] GROUPING, THEY GET THEIR
[ct=3511.740] OH, I THOUGHT WE’D COME IN
[ct=3523.662] TONIGHT AND SEE TERRY McLAURIN
[ct=3524.900] INVOLVED.
[ct=3527.219] I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN TO SEE
[ct=3527.798] HOW THOSE TWO GO AT IT.
[ct=3529.417] MITCHELL’S HAD SUCH A GREAT
[ct=3530.846] START TO HIS CAREER, BUT JUST
[ct=3532.589] NOTHING SO FAR.
[ct=3533.768] >> Al: IT’S REALLY INTERESTING,
[ct=3534.167] TOO.
[ct=3536.016] COMPLETED EIGHT PASSES SINCE
[ct=3539.860] DANIELS, AND ONLY ONE THREW A
[ct=3547.967] WHITE OUT, DYAMI BROWN FOR 5
[ct=3562.602] JUST FIRED, AND AT THE 40 YARD
[ct=3564.616] THE EAGLES SAY NO.
[ct=3567.721] THE OFFICIALS SAY YOU’RE RIGHT.
[ct=3570.275] A TIMEOUT IS TAKEN.
[ct=3572.209] >> Kirk: I’M WITH YOU.
[ct=3573.635] THEY MAY TAKE A PEEK AT THIS AND
[ct=3575.731] SEE IF THE BALL HITS THE
[ct=3576.163] SURFACE.
[ct=3577.979] YEAH, THAT’S INCOMPLETE.
[ct=3578.365] >> Al: RIGHT.
[ct=3580.788] AND FOR THE MOMENT, THEY LET IT
[ct=3583.600] GO ON THE 40 AND NOW THEY LOOK
[ct=3584.965] AT IT UPSTAIRS.
[ct=3586.208] THERE’S NO COACHES CHALLENGES IN
[ct=3587.366] THE LAST TWO MINUTES, AND
[ct=3591.261] THEY’LL MOVE THAT BABY BACK.
[ct=3592.761] THE CLOCK SHOWS 4 SECONDS.
[ct=3594.389] THE CROWD SENSING IT.
[ct=3595.497] >> Kirk: SO NOW YOU’LL GET TO
[ct=3596.562] SEE THAT HAIL MARY MORE THAN
[ct=3599.362] LIKELY.
[ct=3600.398] >> Al: MAYBE, YEP.
[ct=3601.583] I DON’T THINK ANY OF THE
[ct=3603.484] SECONDARY GUYS ARE GOING TO BAIT
[ct=3605.089] THE CROWD, EITHER.
[ct=3606.021] >> Kirk: TALKING TO THE CROWD.
[ct=3607.438] AND THEN BE THE PERSON WHO
[ct=3611.108] TOUCHES THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=3612.388] >> Referee: AFTER REVIEW IT WAS
[ct=3614.154] DETERMINED IT WAS AN INCOMPLETE
[ct=3615.099] PASS.
[ct=3616.418] WASHINGTON WILL NOT BE CHARGED
[ct=3618.465] WITH A TIMEOUT BECAUSE THIS
[ct=3621.250] REVERSAL RESULTS IN A STOPPED
[ct=3621.504] CLOCK.
[ct=3622.705] WASHINGTON HAS ONE TIMEOUT
[ct=3624.799] REMAINING.
[ct=3625.188] >> Al: OKAY.
[ct=3628.506] AND 4 SECONDS ON THE CLOCK.
[ct=3629.371] >> Referee: PLEASE RESET THE
[ct=3632.411] GAME CLOCK TO 5 SECONDS.
[ct=3634.138] >> Al: KAYLEE, RAPIDLY WHAT DO
[ct=3635.696] YOU HAVE?
[ct=3637.854] >> GUYS, JALEN HURTS IS IN THE
[ct=3642.904] TENT RIGHT NOW WITH THE
[ct=3645.086] SPECIALIST.
[ct=3646.900] >> Al: ALL RIGHT, OBVIOUSLY
[ct=3648.945] KEEPING AN EYE ON THAT.
[ct=3649.484] MEANWHILE, EAGLES SEND THREE
[ct=3652.007] GUYS BACK INSIDE THE 10 YARD
[ct=3654.039] >> Kirk: NOBODY’S WAVING TO THE
[ct=3655.258] CROWD.
[ct=3655.706] >> Al: NOT YET.
[ct=3656.542] AND THEY’RE JUST GOING TO RUN
[ct=3659.507] THE BALL HERE AND HALFWAY AND
[ct=3661.141] THE ROBINSON 4-YARD PICKUP.
[ct=3662.660] SO THAT IS THE END OF THE FIRST
[ct=3663.908] HALF IN PHILADELPHIA.
[ct=3664.967] AND THE BATTLE FOR FIRST PLACE
[ct=3666.837] IN THE NFC EAST WITH THE
[ct=3670.956] COMMANDERS LEADING THE EAGLES
[ct=3673.786] 7-3.
[ct=3677.634] AND WE’RE WAITING FOR KAYLEE.
[ct=3678.917] AND HERE SHE IS.
[ct=3681.313] >> WELL, DAN, IT’S BEEN A QUIET
[ct=3682.922] NIGHT FOR TERRY McLAURIN AND
[ct=3685.047] YOUR RECEIVERS.
[ct=3686.327] WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO TO GET
[ct=3687.319] THEM INVOLVED?
[ct=3688.336] >> GET THE BALL IN THE SECOND
[ct=3689.846] THAT’S GOING TO BE A BIG DEAL,
[ct=3691.116] GETTING OUR PLAY MAKERS
[ct=3693.655] NFC EAST, TOUGH DIVISION MATCHUP
[ct=3694.303] LIKE YOU THINK.
[ct=3694.438] THAT’S CERTAINLY A
[ct=3703.026] >> Kirk: SHORT, UNDERNEATH
[ct=3704.665] THROWS.
[ct=3706.139] ANYTHING BEYOND 10 YARDS,
[ct=3707.266] NEITHER GUY HAVING MUCH SUCCESS
[ct=3720.879] AT ALL IN THAT FIRST HALF.
[ct=3729.992] >> Al: AND THEY RETAIN
[ct=3731.752] POSSESSION.
[ct=3732.544] AGAIN, IT WAS EKELER
[ct=3740.083] WHO DROPPED THE PASS.
[ct=3741.054] >> Kirk: AND 32 HAS
[ct=3742.141] BEEN ABLE TO PICK THIS
[ct=3743.066] UP IN WASHINGTON.
[ct=3744.023] THAT’S BEEN A REAL
[ct=3746.142] AREA OF STRENGTH WITH
[ct=3748.057] TURNOVER MARGIN AND
[ct=3750.135] PLUS 6.
[ct=3750.779] LAST YEAR THEY WERE
[ct=3753.091] DEAD LAST IN TURNOVER
[ct=3753.391] MARGIN.
[ct=3754.366] A BIG PART OF THEIR
[ct=3754.916] SUCCESS THEY’VE
[ct=3755.563] ENJOYED THIS YEAR IS
[ct=3756.992] NOT TURNING THAT
[ct=3758.870] FOOTBALL OVER.
[ct=3760.671] >> Al: NO TURNOVERS
[ct=3762.966] FROM EITHER TEAM
[ct=3766.811] FIRST SCRIMMAGE
[ct=3770.727] TONIGHT WILL BE A RUN.
[ct=3772.210] BLANKENSHIP.
[ct=3772.834] KAYLEE WITH SIRIANNI
[ct=3773.736] MOMENTS AGO.
[ct=3774.837] >> NICK, I WAS JUST
[ct=3775.582] TOLD THAT JALEN HURTS
[ct=3776.817] WAS EVALUATED FOR A
[ct=3779.322] CONCUSSION BUT CLEARED
[ct=3779.757] TO RETURN.
[ct=3780.825] WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE,
[ct=3781.876] THOUGH, FOR YOUR
[ct=3782.466] OFFENSE TO GET INTO
[ct=3785.199] THE END ZONE?
[ct=3786.648] >> WE’VE BEEN DRIVING
[ct=3787.870] AND MISSED A COUPLE
[ct=3790.079] FIELD GOALS.
[ct=3793.014] WE SHOT OURSELVES IN
[ct=3794.980] THE FOOT A COUPLE OF
[ct=3794.980] TIMES.
[ct=3795.381] WE’LL GET IT GOING.
[ct=3797.508] >> YOU’VE BEEN ABLE TO
[ct=3797.986] TAKE THE COMMANDERS
[ct=3798.799] OFFENSE OUT OF THE
[ct=3799.737] >> WE CONTINUE WITH
[ct=3800.666] THE PRESSURE UP FRONT,
[ct=3801.376] AND I THINK THEY’RE
[ct=3802.341] DOING A GOOD JOB IN
[ct=3804.654] THE SECONDARY GETTING
[ct=3805.604] AFTER THEM.
[ct=3807.587] >> MEANWHILE, THAT
[ct=3808.231] LINE DOES A GREAT
[ct=3811.632] HERE.
[ct=3811.956] STOPPING ROBINSON IN
[ct=3813.341] HIS TRACKS AND TURNING
[ct=3815.100] HIS 2nd AND 2 INTO A
[ct=3817.063] 3rd AND 5.
[ct=3817.873] >> Kirk: THAT IS A
[ct=3822.783] TOUGH THING TO DO.
[ct=3823.374] WYLIE GETS OFF THE
[ct=3824.647] LINE OF SCRIMMAGE A
[ct=3825.307] LITTLE BIT SLOW.
[ct=3826.152] AND THE GET OFF BY
[ct=3826.858] CARTER ALONG
[ct=3829.185] POWER IS WHAT
[ct=3830.818] SEPARATES HIM, AND A
[ct=3831.619] TOUGH ASK OF THAT
[ct=3834.243] RIGHT TACKLE AND NOT
[ct=3838.617] UP TO THE TASK THERE.
[ct=3838.934] >> Al: HE MISSED LAST
[ct=3839.955] WEEK’S GAME WITH A
[ct=3840.711] SHOULDER INJURY.
[ct=3846.724] BLITZING, PASS IS
[ct=3846.724] BROKEN UP AT THE 50
[ct=3853.737] BUT A FLAG IS THROWN.
[ct=3853.961] BROWN THE INTENDED
[ct=3856.116] RECEIVER.
[ct=3856.861] AND COOPER DeJEAN THE
[ct=3857.646] ROOKIE.
[ct=3858.494] >> Kirk: I THINK THEY
[ct=3860.716] GET HIM FOR A PULL-ON
[ct=3861.451] THE JERSEY, ASE’S
[ct=3862.925] CUTTING OUT ON HIS
[ct=3863.714] ROUTE.
[ct=3864.537] >> Referee: PASS
[ct=3866.610] INTERFERENCE DEFENSE
[ct=3871.072] >> Kirk: THE ONLY
[ct=3871.626] THING I CAN SEE IS
[ct=3872.820] THAT HE PULLED --
[ct=3874.226] WATCH AS NOAH BROWN
[ct=3875.394] SETS HIM UP ON THE
[ct=3875.902] ROUTE, AND NEAR THE
[ct=3876.855] TOP OF THE ROUTE HE
[ct=3878.220] PULLS AWAY AND THEN
[ct=3878.759] THAT RIGHT HAND JUST
[ct=3880.196] GRABS ON, TOUGH TO SEE
[ct=3882.264] DIDN’T REALLY SLOW HIM
[ct=3886.164] DOWN AT ALL.
[ct=3888.268] >> Al: WE’VE SEEN
[ct=3890.298] WORSE, HAVEN’T WE?
[ct=3891.974] >> Kirk: OH, YEAH.
[ct=3893.619] >> Al: AND EVEN TERRY
[ct=3896.211] FROM HIS VANTAGE POINT
[ct=3898.112] GOING AH.
[ct=3901.312] AT THE 50 YARD LINE.
[ct=3902.083] ROBINSON AND EKELER
[ct=3904.194] BOTH IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=3904.477] AND ROBINSON WILL GO
[ct=3907.341] FOR A GAIN OF 2 IN
[ct=3908.015] EAGLES TERRITORY.
[ct=3909.314] >> Kirk: I THINK THIS
[ct=3910.789] IS -- I’D LOVE TO HEAR
[ct=3911.501] TERRY AND WHAT HE HAS
[ct=3912.061] TO SAY.
[ct=3913.153] THIS IS WHAT HE WORKS
[ct=3913.646] OUT.
[ct=3915.941] I THOUGHT HE GRABBED
[ct=3917.422] ONTO THE JERSEY.
[ct=3920.087] NOT THERE BUT THERE.
[ct=3920.360] AND HE DIDN’T SLOW HIM
[ct=3924.592] I GUESS THE VIEW FROM
[ct=3925.768] OFFICIAL YOU SEE THAT
[ct=3928.772] HE’S GRABBING.
[ct=3930.521] >> YOU CAN’T
[ct=3930.890] SIGNIFICANTLY HI
[ct=3931.644] I DON’T SEE
[ct=3933.493] >> Al: MEANWHILE
[ct=3936.115] EKELER TAKING IT
[ct=3936.700] INSIDE THE 30 YARD
[ct=3938.393] LINE FROM THE 28.
[ct=3939.312] HE’S BEEN THEIR
[ct=3940.097] PRIMARY RECEIVER, GAIN
[ct=3940.686] OF 20.
[ct=3943.569] TARGETED 17 TIMES,
[ct=3943.918] CAUGHT SIX.
[ct=3945.045] SIX OF THE NINE
[ct=3945.365] COMPLETIONS HAVE BEEN
[ct=3947.983] TO AUSTIN EKELER.
[ct=3949.501] >> Kirk: I FEEL THAT
[ct=3949.501] PLAY AGAINST
[ct=3950.538] PHILADELPHIA ALL NIGHT
[ct=3951.904] WITH THE TEMPO LOOK
[ct=3952.932] THEY’LL THROW AT YOU,
[ct=3953.940] JUST OUT, NOT QUITE
[ct=3955.764] LINED UPCOMING OFF OF
[ct=3956.762] THAT PENALTY, NOT
[ct=3958.097] REALLY IN POSITION,
[ct=3958.578] AND WASHINGTON ABLE TO
[ct=3961.860] TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
[ct=3964.100] THAT.
[ct=3967.547] >> Al: ROBINSON ROOM
[ct=3968.372] TO ROAM.
[ct=3976.320] TO THE 20 HE GOES.
[ct=3978.410] >> Kirk: AND THAT PONY
[ct=3978.883] LOOK THEY’RE GOING
[ct=3979.877] WITH THE TWO BACKS I
[ct=3980.608] THINK CAUSES SOME
[ct=3986.534] CONFUSION AND HEZ
[ct=3986.534] TAGDS, WHICH
[ct=3987.930] HEZITATION, WHICH IS
[ct=3988.171] GIVING THEM A LOT OF
[ct=3988.504] ROOM TO PICK UP SOME
[ct=3989.337] MOMENTUM AND GET
[ct=3990.690] DOWNHILL ONE OF THOSE
[ct=3996.332] LINE BACKERS.
[ct=3999.215] >> Al: ON 2nd AND 2.
[ct=4001.014] EKELER IN MOTION.
[ct=4006.615] DANIELS WILL KEEP IT.
[ct=4006.973] BRANDON GRAHAM RIGHT
[ct=4011.335] NUMBER 55 STOPPING
[ct=4014.798] 3rd AND 4.
[ct=4015.169] >> Kirk: YOU TAKE
[ct=4016.705] NAKOBE DEAN WITH YOU,
[ct=4017.158] WITH THAT MOTION.
[ct=4019.470] SO YOU THINK THE
[ct=4021.019] NUMBER TO YOUR, YOU
[ct=4022.668] RUN THE QUARTERBACK
[ct=4022.715] COUNTER.
[ct=4023.266] THEY’VE BEEN RUNNING
[ct=4024.102] THE COUNTER WITH
[ct=4025.210] ROBINSON.
[ct=4025.851] NUMBERS ARE FAVORABLE,
[ct=4027.001] BUT A GOOD JOB
[ct=4027.706] SQUEEZING ON THE
[ct=4028.430] OUTSIDE BY THAT
[ct=4029.902] DEFENSE LED BY 55,
[ct=4032.931] GRAHAM.
[ct=4034.267] >> Al: 3rd AND 4th.
[ct=4039.316] DANIELS BACK PEDALS,
[ct=4040.225] FIRES, NOTHING.
[ct=4041.402] INCOMPLETE.
[ct=4042.949] FIRST TIME THEY EVEN
[ct=4044.964] LOOK McLAURIN’S WAY.
[ct=4046.726] SO THEIR LEADING
[ct=4047.449] RECEIVER HAS NOT BEEN
[ct=4049.493] TARGETED UNTIL NOW.
[ct=4051.000] >> Kirk: YEAH, THEY
[ct=4051.863] JUST -- THE ROUTE NEAR
[ct=4058.612] THE END OF IT, TERRY
[ct=4060.991] McLAURIN, DO I NEED TO
[ct=4063.858] CONTINUE.
[ct=4065.115] I THINK DANIELS
[ct=4065.600] THOUGHT HE WOULD
[ct=4067.759] CONTINUE BUT HE
[ct=4067.950] STOPPED FOR WHATEVER
[ct=4068.538] REASON.
[ct=4069.470] AND ONCE AGAIN NOT
[ct=4071.983] QUITE IN SYNC.

[ct=4089.987] NO KICK, NO PLAY.
[ct=4091.872] DELAY OF GAME.
[ct=4093.056] OPERATION.
[ct=4093.474] LIKE YOU SAID A NEW
[ct=4094.494] KICKER CAPABLE OF
[ct=4095.211] MAKING THE KICK, BUT
[ct=4096.827] THE HOLDER, THE SNAP,
[ct=4097.287] EVERYBODY’S JUST
[ct=4098.178] MAKING SURE THE NEW
[ct=4099.799] KICKER IS READY TO GO.
[ct=4103.466] THERE’S THE PLAY
[ct=4107.562] THE HOLDER NOT EVEN
[ct=4107.739] AWARE OF THAT PLAY
[ct=4112.203] DOWN IN 5, 4, 3, AND
[ct=4115.591] 2, SO PUSH HIM BACK 5

[ct=4212.029] DOING A BETTER JOB
[ct=4213.310] OUTSIDE THAN HE HAS ON
[ct=4214.648] THE INSIDE.
[ct=4215.364] INSIDE THE TACKLE AN
[ct=4216.030] AREA PHILADELPHIA
[ct=4217.122] REALLY PRIDES ITSELF
[ct=4217.822] ON BEING ABLE TO
[ct=4218.942] ESTABLISH THAT INSIDE
[ct=4221.384] RUN GAME TO SETUP
[ct=4221.693] OTHER ASPECTS.
[ct=4222.876] YOU CAN SEE HE HAS NOT
[ct=4223.680] HAD A GREAT START.
[ct=4225.195] HE AND THAT OFFENSIVE
[ct=4225.985] LINE NOT OFF TO A
[ct=4228.240] GREAT START.

[ct=4263.309] CUT AT THE BASE
[ct=4264.410] BETWEEN HIS PINKIE AND
[ct=4265.728] RING FINGER.
[ct=4267.475] THEY WERE APPLYING A
[ct=4269.996] STERILE SUPER GLUE
[ct=4271.077] THAT CAN QUICKLY CLOSE
[ct=4272.783] THAT WOUND, AND NOW
[ct=4274.610] HE’S ALL BUNDLED UP.
[ct=4275.202] >> Kirk: RIGHT NOW
[ct=4276.559] YOU’VE GOT TO GIVE
[ct=4277.282] PHILADELPHIA A LOT OF
[ct=4278.116] CREDIT FOR CONFUSING
[ct=4280.211] HIM AND THE ENTIRE
[ct=4281.788] COMMANDERS OFFENSE.
[ct=4282.596] JUST NOT ABLE TO GET

[ct=4298.976] YEAR THIS DEFENSE TO
[ct=4299.600] WHAT THEY’RE DOING
[ct=4299.960] THIS YEAR.
[ct=4300.401] IT’S GOT TO BE ONE OF
[ct=4301.674] THE GREAT TURN AROUNDS
[ct=4303.650] IN THE ENTIRE NFL,
[ct=4307.354] WHAT DAN QUINN AND JOE
[ct=4308.780] WHITT HAVE BEEN ABLE
[ct=4309.099] TO DO WITH HIS
[ct=4310.807] EVERY SINGLE STAT YOU

[ct=4327.052] >> Al: YEAH, A LOT OF
[ct=4327.888] NEW PIECES.
[ct=4330.671] THEY CONVERT ON THIRD
[ct=4334.845] GOEDERT MAKES THE
[ct=4335.618] DRIVE AND CHINN TRACKS
[ct=4336.358] HIM DOWN.
[ct=4337.980] THAT GIVES EVERYONE
[ct=4338.500] SOMETHING TO YELL
[ct=4339.539] ABOUT.
[ct=4340.666] >> Kirk: CAME BACK
[ct=4341.140] LAST WEEK AFTER BEING
[ct=4342.504] OUT A FEW WEEKS, AND
[ct=4343.040] BIG PART OF THIS
[ct=4344.243] OFFENSE JUST KIND OF A
[ct=4346.997] LITTLE BIT OF A DELAY
[ct=4347.805] GETS LOST, CHINN I
[ct=4348.892] THINK WITH HIS EYES IN
[ct=4351.710] THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=4352.173] LOSES IN SPACE THERE
[ct=4353.109] IN THAT ZONE.
[ct=4355.963] LOSES THE THREAT OF
[ct=4360.227] GOEDERT.
[ct=4362.138] >> Al: FROM THE 36.
[ct=4364.785] STOPPED BARKLEY IN HIS
[ct=4366.214] TRACKS.
[ct=4367.613] BOBBY WAGNER.
[ct=4370.228] WHAT A PICK UP HE IS.
[ct=4371.195] WAGNER GOES BACK WITH
[ct=4372.386] DAN QUINN, SO YOU’RE
[ct=4373.717] TALKING ABOUT A GUY
[ct=4375.234] WHO KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT
[ct=4376.194] HIS COACH WANTS AND
[ct=4377.166] THERE HE IS.
[ct=4378.157] >> Kirk: YEAH, HE’S
[ct=4379.264] DONE A GREAT JOB BEING
[ct=4381.748] ALL OVER THE FIELD.
[ct=4381.748] AND LIKE I SAID THE

[ct=4386.113] WEDNESDAYS, THE WAY HE
[ct=4387.591] MAKES THE GUYS COME
[ct=4390.313] IN, STUDY FILM, SHOWS
[ct=4391.133] EVERYBODY REALLY WHAT
[ct=4392.286] IT TAKES TO BE A

[ct=4409.236] TAKES IT UP TO ABOUT
[ct=4409.912] THE -- DID HE SAY
[ct=4414.757] TIGER WOODS ON THAT?
[ct=4414.757] >> Kirk: ALL I KNOW IS
[ct=4415.053] HE WAS GETTING
[ct=4416.214] FRUSTRATED.
[ct=4416.863] HE WANTED THAT SNAP TO
[ct=4419.515] COME UP BEFORE THE
[ct=4421.427] THREAT OF A DELAY OF

[ct=4441.763] BIG GAIN HERE.
[ct=4443.048] INTO THE SECONDARY
[ct=4444.109] GOES SAQUON BARKLEY
[ct=4445.979] DOWN TO THE 21 YARD
[ct=4448.621] A LITTLE LOLLY POP
[ct=4451.768] PASS, GOT AWAY.
[ct=4452.657] THE TURN WOULD HAVE
[ct=4455.243] BEEN A SHORT GAIN TO A
[ct=4456.524] VERY LONG ONE.
[ct=4457.875] 43 YARDS.
[ct=4458.550] >> Kirk: BLITZ THE

[ct=4468.294] THE SAFETY.
[ct=4468.691] NOBODY THERE TO PICK
[ct=4469.820] UP SAQUON BARKLEY

[ct=4488.683] BY SAINRISITIL.
[ct=4490.040] 2nd DOWN AND 8.
[ct=4493.292] >> Kirk: RIGHT THERE
[ct=4493.292] THAT MISSED TACKLE,
[ct=4494.147] HE’S GOT TO BE ABLE TO
[ct=4495.402] MAKE THAT PLAY BECAUSE
[ct=4495.975] EVERYONE ELSE IS
[ct=4497.872] LOCKED UP IN MANNED
[ct=4501.055] THEY HAVE NO IDEA THAT
[ct=4501.959] ANYBODY IN OPEN FIELD
[ct=4503.952] HAS THE FOOTBALL.

[ct=4532.116] 3rd AND 6 THIRD
[ct=4533.411] QUARTER.
[ct=4533.944] >> Kirk: YEAH, JUST
[ct=4536.730] IN FACT, YOU HEARD
[ct=4537.888] NICK SIRIANNI MENTION
[ct=4539.009] THIS WHEN HE TALKED TO
[ct=4540.383] KAYLEE ABOUT WE’VE GOT
[ct=4541.279] TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
[ct=4541.916] THESE OPPORTUNITIES.
[ct=4543.429] WELL, HERE WE ARE.
[ct=4545.153] DOWN 7, 3rd AND 6.
[ct=4546.157] AGAIN, YOU DON’T WANT
[ct=4547.351] TO ROLL HIM OUT
[ct=4547.969] NECESSARILY.
[ct=4549.208] YOU KEEP HIM IN THAT
[ct=4549.509] POCKET WHERE HE HAS
[ct=4550.348] THE THREAT OF ALWAYS
[ct=4552.007] BEING ABLE TO STEP UP,
[ct=4553.531] BUYING TIME TO FIND
[ct=4556.322] TARGETS.
[ct=4559.185] A.J. BROWN, DALLAS
[ct=4562.199] BOTH THOSE GUYS GREAT
[ct=4565.203] THREATS IN THIS AREA.
[ct=4565.625] >> Al: GAINWELL STILL

[ct=4580.090] THIRD, 4th DOWN AND A
[ct=4583.047] FIELD GOAL COMING IN
[ct=4586.680] AGAIN.
[ct=4587.851] >> Kirk: HE’S OUT
[ct=4589.324] THERE ON AN ISLAND
[ct=4590.110] AGAINST A.J. BROWN.
[ct=4593.135] WE SAW DAVANTE SMITH
[ct=4594.151] GIVE HIM THAT SAME
[ct=4595.298] DOUBLE MOVE, LITTLE
[ct=4597.033] STUTTER AND HE WAS IN
[ct=4598.676] GREAT POSITION EARLIER

[ct=4623.717] WARRIORS FOR MANY
[ct=4625.150] YEARS, AARENTLY HAS
[ct=4625.783] COME BACK AS WELL.
[ct=4628.979] TOUCHBACK.
[ct=4629.717] MEANWHILE, JOSH OWENS,
[ct=4630.834] HE OWNS THREE
[ct=4632.418] DIFFERENT TEAMS.
[ct=4635.518] HE’S GOT THE SIXERS.
[ct=4636.258] THE NEW JERSEY FIRST
[ct=4636.737] PLACE IN THEIR
[ct=4637.167] DIVISION.
[ct=4637.788] THEY’RE HAPPY UP THERE
[ct=4639.313] AND OF COURSE HAPPY IN
[ct=4639.569] WASHINGTON AND HE’S
[ct=4644.576] TAKEN OVER.
[ct=4644.576] >> Kirk: SECOND

[ct=4645.329] AND THIS YEAR HE
[ct=4646.819] STOPPED BY TO GET
[ct=4648.581] READY FOR THE GAME.
[ct=4649.993] HERE’S AN OWNER THAT
[ct=4651.049] GREW UP THE FAN OF THE
[ct=4652.663] TEAM THAT HE NOW OWNS,
[ct=4655.618] AND HE IS DETERMINED
[ct=4655.618] AND PASSIONATE ABOUT
[ct=4656.730] GETTING THIS FRANCHISE
[ct=4657.621] HEADING IN THE RIGHT
[ct=4658.966] DIRECTION.
[ct=4658.966] KAYLEE JUST TALKED
[ct=4659.808] ABOUT THE MOVES HE
[ct=4661.016] MADE FROM LAST YEAR,
[ct=4662.740] CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHERE
[ct=4663.524] THIS WILL CONTINUE TO
[ct=4664.998] GO.
[ct=4665.978] >> Al: SAW THE ARENA
[ct=4668.599] ACROSS THE PARKING LOT
[ct=4669.620] WHERE THE 76ers AND
[ct=4671.527] THE PHILADELPHIA
[ct=4672.001] FLYERS PLAY.
[ct=4672.887] AS ROBINSON PICKS UP A
[ct=4673.346] COUPLE HERE.
[ct=4676.099] MAKE IT 3, 2nd AND 7.
[ct=4676.901] >> Kirk: MAKE MOW

[ct=4679.310] IT’S 10-6 GAME, FIVE
[ct=4681.446] MINUTES TO GO IN THE
[ct=4683.535] SECOND QUARTER.
[ct=4684.467] THIS IS A MASSIVE GAME
[ct=4685.342] FOR THE COMMANDERS.
[ct=4687.438] I CAN’T REMEMBER THE
[ct=4688.366] LAST TIME THEY HAD A
[ct=4688.773] GAME THIS BIG AT THIS
[ct=4689.254] STAGE OF THE SEASON.
[ct=4690.520] I MEAN, THIS IS A BIG
[ct=4690.864] OPPORTUNITY ON THE
[ct=4692.763] ROAD TO PHILLY.
[ct=4693.248] >> Al: YEAH, BEEN A
[ct=4694.208] WHILE.
[ct=4695.113] LONG TIME SINCE THEY
[ct=4697.372] EVEN FINISHED UP.
[ct=4698.210] DANIELS NICE MOVE.
[ct=4699.214] HE TAKES IT TO THE 40
[ct=4701.429] YARD LINE, AND THAT’LL
[ct=4703.492] BE A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4704.707] THIS TEAM, THE LAST
[ct=4705.384] TIME THEY WON A
[ct=4709.466] PLAYOFF GAME WAS IN
[ct=4711.266] ’05, 19 YEARS AGO, NO
[ct=4712.825] POST-SEASON WINS SINCE
[ct=4715.229] THEN.
[ct=4715.553] THEY HAVE 13 FORMER
[ct=4716.386] NFL PLAYERS ON THE
[ct=4717.284] COACHING STAFF RIGHT
[ct=4720.401] >> Kirk: VERY
[ct=4720.627] INTENTIONAL ABOUT THE
[ct=4721.254] ENERGY AND THE PEOPLE
[ct=4723.047] THEY PUT ON THEIR

[ct=4734.935] THE BACKUP
[ct=4737.412] QUARTERBACK, MARCUS
[ct=4740.489] MARIOTA AND THAT WAS
[ct=4741.266] INTENTIONAL.
[ct=4742.917] YOU LOOK AT THE REST

[ct=4745.855] THEY BRING OVER BRIAN
[ct=4748.378] JOHNSON HERE IN
[ct=4754.777] PRITCHARD.
[ct=4755.122] I THINK EVERYONE LIKES

[ct=4758.416] BUILDING AROUND JAYDEN
[ct=4762.823] >> Al: SO FAR SO GOOD.

[ct=4773.240] 3:45 TO GO IN THE
[ct=4775.145] THIRD.
[ct=4776.064] >> Kirk: JALEN CARTER
[ct=4777.256] HAS JUST TAKEN HIS
[ct=4778.654] GAME TO ANOTHER LEVEL.
[ct=4779.637] ANYBODY WHO FOLLOWED
[ct=4781.140] HIM IN COLLEGE WHEN
[ct=4783.603] WAS AT GEORGIA REALLY
[ct=4784.319] KNEW IT WAS A MATTER
[ct=4785.476] OF TIME UNTIL HE WOULD
[ct=4786.841] BECOME AN ENFORCER IN
[ct=4788.499] THE INTERIOR.
[ct=4789.320] JORDAN DAVIS WAS IN
[ct=4790.954] THERE, BIG BODY.
[ct=4791.755] BUT CARTER JUST
[ct=4792.564] VIOLENT IN HOW HE
[ct=4793.894] PLAYS AGAINST THE RUN
[ct=4795.795] AND USING THAT CLUB
[ct=4797.516] AND QUICK GET OFF
[ct=4799.945] AGAINST THE PASS.
[ct=4800.841] >> Al: 3rd AND 5.
[ct=4802.366] LOOK OUT, THERE HE
[ct=4810.207] GOES, 34 YARD LINE,
[ct=4812.036] SMITH, ANOTHER ONE OF
[ct=4812.505] THOSE BULL DOGS GETS
[ct=4815.956] THE SACK.
[ct=4817.695] >> Kirk: COLEMAN LINED
[ct=4819.328] UP REALLY FAR TO THE
[ct=4820.717] OUTSIDE TO CREATE THAT
[ct=4821.489] OPPORTUNITY TO BEND
[ct=4822.386] UNDERNEATH HIM, USE
[ct=4823.447] HIS QUICKNESS.
[ct=4823.888] HE’S A LITTLE BIT
[ct=4825.057] UNDERSIZED AT THIS
[ct=4826.518] LEVEL, BUT BECAUSE
[ct=4827.681] HE’S SO QUICK AND SO
[ct=4828.790] AGGRESSIVE, HE’S ABLE
[ct=4829.984] TO WIN, AND THAT TIME
[ct=4831.636] HE GOT AROUND HIM.
[ct=4833.573] GREAT PLAY.
[ct=4836.618] >> Al: TRESS WAY WITH
[ct=4836.618] HIS FIFTH PUNT OF THE
[ct=4850.883] COOPER DEJEAN.
[ct=4851.846] WAITING, AND RUNS IT
[ct=4854.864] BACK TO THE 13HEIR BUY.
[ct=4856.370] THE COMMANDERS WILL
[ct=4859.373] GET THEIR BUY WEEK 14.
[ct=4861.655] 1st AND 10 FROM THE 24
[ct=4867.978] DOTSON WAS THE MAN IN
[ct=4869.386] MOTION.
[ct=4869.386] THERE GOES
[ct=4871.068] BARKLEY SPINNING.
[ct=4871.305] FOR A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4872.740] GETTING OUT TO THE 34
[ct=4875.618] SO SAQUON TONIGHT HAS
[ct=4878.037] CARRIED 19 TIMES FOR
[ct=4879.630] 70 YARDS.
[ct=4881.227] THEY SPOT HIM A YARD
[ct=4886.956] SHY, 2nd DOWN AND 1.
[ct=4900.423] SMITH, DAVANTE SMITH
[ct=4901.907] HAS ENOUGH FOR THE
[ct=4904.770] CROWD SENSING THAT THE
[ct=4906.328] PERSONAL FOUL WAS
[ct=4911.203] FRANKIE LUVU, LEGAL
[ct=4911.203] TACKLE RIGHT THERE.
[ct=4914.019] >> Kirk: HE’S GOT THE
[ct=4916.043] NUMBERS OUT ON THE
[ct=4917.344] THREE AGAINST TWO, AND
[ct=4918.635] MAKES A GOOD DECISION
[ct=4919.858] JUST TO GET IT TO
[ct=4920.732] DVONTAYE SMITH.
[ct=4921.365] THAT’S WHAT THE CROWD
[ct=4922.748] REACTED TO.
[ct=4923.482] THEY THOUGHT THAT
[ct=4928.502] MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LATE
[ct=4930.911] HIT.
[ct=4932.529] >> Al: FIRST DOWN, 34
[ct=4934.286] THREE RECEIVERS, SET
[ct=4936.097] TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=4937.609] AND ONE COMES INTO THE
[ct=4938.528] SLOT, THE OTHER IN
[ct=4944.252] MOTION TO THE LEFT.
[ct=4946.331] HURTS CHASED, THROWS,
[ct=4950.848] CAUGHT, BROWN 50-YARD
[ct=4953.077] TO THE 48 YARD LINE HE
[ct=4954.300] GOES.
[ct=4956.644] SO BROWN WAS ABLE TO
[ct=4956.644] WORK HIMSELF FREE.
[ct=4958.017] A MINUTE TO GO AND 17
[ct=4960.343] YARD GAIN.
[ct=4961.839] >> Kirk: THAT’S A
[ct=4963.176] GREAT WORD, WORK.
[ct=4964.041] HE’S TO THE RIGHT AND
[ct=4965.511] HAS TO WORK WITH JALEN
[ct=4966.818] HURTS ALL THE WAY
[ct=4967.201] OVER.
[ct=4968.168] ONCE THE QUARTERBACK
[ct=4968.830] STARTS TO RUN, HE
[ct=4969.806] NEARS HIM AND
[ct=4970.417] EVENTUALLY THEY’RE
[ct=4971.338] ABLE TO HOOK UP FOR
[ct=4976.241] THAT FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4977.088] >> Al: THROWN FOR 180
[ct=4981.776] THROWN TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=4985.099] SMITH LOOKS AROUND.
[ct=4986.075] CROWD SENSING A FACE
[ct=4987.960] MASK.
[ct=4988.369] FRANKIE LUVU WAS
[ct=4990.160] OFFICIALS CONFERRING
[ct=4991.179] WITH EACH OTHER TO SEE
[ct=4994.276] EXACTLY WHAT THE ISSUE
[ct=4995.719] IS.
[ct=4996.005] >> Kirk: MAYBE GOT THE
[ct=4998.548] HELMET OPENING HERE.
[ct=5000.386] >> Al: LOOKS LIKE IT.
[ct=5001.540] THIS IS WHY IT’S
[ct=5004.159] ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A
[ct=5004.548] LITTLE CONFERENCE.
[ct=5006.101] ONE GUY SEES IT ONE
[ct=5008.230] WAY, THE OTHER GUY
[ct=5010.674] SEES IT THE OTHER WAY.
[ct=5011.118] TERRY, WHAT ARE YOU
[ct=5015.468] SEEING?
[ct=5016.488] >> YEAH, KIRK SAID IF
[ct=5018.825] HE GETS THE HELMET
[ct=5019.068] OPENING, THAT’S JUST
[ct=5019.690] LIKE THE FATES MASK
[ct=5024.619] AND WOULD BE A 15 YARD
[ct=5026.984] PENALTY.
[ct=5027.195] >> Al: I THINK IT WAS
[ct=5034.630] UNDERNEATH THE HELMET.
[ct=5035.160] >> YEAH, THAT’S THE
[ct=5036.760] HELMET OPENING.
[ct=5037.614] THEY SHOULD HAVE LEFT
[ct=5039.909] THE FLAG DOWN.
[ct=5040.986] >> Al: BUT THEY DON’T.
[ct=5044.287] THERE’S YOUR REACTION.
[ct=5044.287] >> Kirk: CROWD AGREES
[ct=5045.982] WITH TERRY.
[ct=5052.141] >> Al: YOU THINK?
[ct=5053.923] WELL, THEY WIND THE
[ct=5056.867] CLOCK 2nd DOWN AND 7
[ct=5058.199] AS THE ORDER IS READY
[ct=5061.359] TO EXPIRE ON THE 45
[ct=5070.135] GOING TO BE 3rd DOWN.
[ct=5071.484] >> Kirk: SEE THAT LAST
[ct=5075.073] HE WAS WORKED UP.
[ct=5082.280] >> Al: NOT A LOT OF
[ct=5083.344] CLEAN POCKETS TONIGHT.
[ct=5084.670] I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
[ct=5086.924] IT’S EVEN MORE THAN
[ct=5090.218] THREESIC
[ct=5091.391] THREE SACKS, THREE
[ct=5092.321] HURRIES.
[ct=5093.203] YOU’RE RIGHT, IT SEEMS
[ct=5095.229] LIKE A LOT MORE,
[ct=5096.751] DOESN’T IT?
[ct=5097.491] >> Kirk: AND EVERY
[ct=5098.093] OPPORTUNITY COUNTS.
[ct=5099.195] YOU’RE INTO THE FOURTH
[ct=5099.912] QUART, A GAME THAT’S
[ct=5101.385] NOT BEEN THE PRETTIEST
[ct=5103.182] FOR EITHER OF THESE.
[ct=5104.096] PHILADELPHIA DOWN IN
[ct=5106.194] PLUS TERRITORY.
[ct=5106.403] NEEDS TO CAPITALIZE ON
[ct=5108.546] EVERY CHANCE THEY GET.
[ct=5110.387] >> Al: THIS IS A 3rd
[ct=5116.519] AND 7.
[ct=5120.710] HURTS, RUN FOR IT.
[ct=5122.034] AND WILL DIVE.
[ct=5123.783] COMING UP A LITTLE BIT
[ct=5124.207] SHORT.
[ct=5128.791] BUTLER SAVED A FIRST
[ct=5130.763] DOWN, SO NOW YOU’VE
[ct=5132.244] GOT A FOURTH DOWN
[ct=5133.221] UPCOMING.
[ct=5135.941] 4th AND A YARD, YARD A
[ct=5138.595] AND HALF MAYBE.
[ct=5139.582] >> Kirk: EXTRA EFFORT
[ct=5140.737] AS HE EXTENDS.
[ct=5142.329] YEAH, HE’S RIGHT
[ct=5144.376] >> Al: THEY’VE BEEN
[ct=5145.581] CHALLENGED.
[ct=5146.090] >> Kirk: BACK FOOT IS
[ct=5147.750] ELEVATED.
[ct=5148.939] HIS FOOT NEVER
[ct=5149.201] TOUCHES.
[ct=5153.348] DEFINITELY FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5153.348] >> Al: IT IS.
[ct=5154.948] REPLAY ASSIST FROM
[ct=5156.995] UPSTAIRS.
[ct=5159.006] >> Kirk: TREMENDOUS
[ct=5159.564] EFFORT, BY THE WAY.
[ct=5160.507] YOU SAW THE SAFETY
[ct=5161.571] BUTLER CHASING HIM AND
[ct=5163.217] USING HIS SPEED.
[ct=5164.154] LOOKED LIKE HE WAS
[ct=5164.947] ANTICIPATING HURTS MAY
[ct=5165.911] TAKE OFF AND GO.
[ct=5167.343] LOOK AT THAT EFFORT BY
[ct=5168.280] BOTH THESE GUYS.
[ct=5168.919] THE SAFETY BUTLER
[ct=5169.459] TRYING TO MAKE THE
[ct=5171.195] PLAY, AND HURTS AT THE
[ct=5173.078] LAST SECOND KNOWS HE’S
[ct=5174.055] GOT TO EXTEND, KEEPS
[ct=5177.907] EXTENDS WITH THE RIGHT
[ct=5179.960] HAND TO GET THE FIRST.
[ct=5180.735] >> Al: THERE YOU HAVE
[ct=5182.671] IT, GOAL IN BOUNDS AND
[ct=5183.410] STILL ALIVE AT THAT
[ct=5183.783] POINT.
[ct=5186.903] ENOUGH FOR THE FIRST
[ct=5188.756] 38 NOW.
[ct=5192.543] GAINWELL IS IN THE
[ct=5200.269] BACKFIELD.
[ct=5201.683] ALMOST DUCKED.
[ct=5202.861] >> Kirk: THAT DIDN’T
[ct=5203.448] FLINCH THE RIGHT
[ct=5203.936] GUARD.
[ct=5206.586] REACTION WAS.
[ct=5207.038] >> Al: HERE’S
[ct=5209.478] GAINWELL.
[ct=5210.503] GAINWELL A 14-YARD
[ct=5213.608] GAIN OFF THE BACK OF
[ct=5215.097] LANE JOHNSON, WHO’S
[ct=5216.207] ONLY BEEN DOING THIS
[ct=5218.993] FOR 12 YEARS.
[ct=5221.516] >> Kirk: OLD SCHOOL
[ct=5222.616] TRAP HERE WITH LANE
[ct=5223.127] JOHNSON.
[ct=5223.985] THERE’S THE FLINCH
[ct=5225.915] THAT THEY REACTED TO,
[ct=5225.915] THE DEFENSE REACTED
[ct=5226.174] TO.
[ct=5227.321] IT WAS A LITTLE
[ct=5227.741] MOVEMENT.
[ct=5230.491] ONE OF YOUR 363
[ct=5231.715] POUNDS, IT NEEDS TO BE
[ct=5232.196] MORE MOVEMENT THAN
[ct=5234.264] WHAT A BLOCK, THOUGH,
[ct=5234.912] BY THE RIGHT TACKLE.
[ct=5236.982] LANE JOHNSON OPENING
[ct=5244.406] THAT PLAY UP.
[ct=5246.983] >> Al: OH, GAINWELL
[ct=5247.518] AGAIN!
[ct=5248.719] TO THE 10 YARD LINE HE
[ct=5250.452] BACK-TO-BACK, BIG
[ct=5252.787] RUNS.
[ct=5253.263] CHINN MAKES THE STOP
[ct=5254.552] AND THAT’S A GAIN OF
[ct=5256.351] 14.
[ct=5257.071] >> Kirk: THEY PULL THE
[ct=5258.846] BIG FELLA.
[ct=5260.187] THEY’RE GETTING ANGLES
[ct=5262.652] NOW UP FRONT THESE
[ct=5265.823] LAST COUPLE RUN PLAYS.
[ct=5266.359] >> Al: THEY GO NO
[ct=5268.213] HUDDLE HERE.
[ct=5274.915] 11.
[ct=5278.783] THROUGH THE MIDDLE
[ct=5281.583] GAINWELL TO THE 5 AND
[ct=5283.587] MAYBE A LITTLE BEYOND
[ct=5287.010] >> Kirk: BEHIND BIG
[ct=5291.022] LANE JOHNSON.
[ct=5295.291] MYKAL BECTON.
[ct=5297.273] STARTING TO IMPOSE
[ct=5297.574] THEIR WILL UP FRONT.
[ct=5297.974] WE’VE NOT
[ct=5300.066] OF THAT TONIGHT.
[ct=5301.672] WE EXPECTED IT.
[ct=5302.321] WE THOUGHT THEY COULD
[ct=5303.677] HAVE A LOT OF
[ct=5304.880] ADVANTAGE.
[ct=5306.388] WASHINGTON HAS HELD
[ct=5307.856] THEIR OWN UNTIL THESE
[ct=5310.172] LAST FEW PLAYS.
[ct=5312.518] >> Al: GAINWELL THREE
[ct=5314.299] GOOD RUNS, AND NOW
[ct=5315.464] BARKLEY IS BACK IN.
[ct=5315.954] GAINWELL OUT.
[ct=5320.175] 2nd AND 3.
[ct=5322.129] BARKLEY INTO -- NO, TO
[ct=5325.432] THE 1 YARD LINE.
[ct=5325.749] CROWD THOUGHT HE GOT
[ct=5328.306] OFFICIALS SAY NO.
[ct=5328.974] DICKERSON LEADING THE
[ct=5330.555] WAY.
[ct=5330.759] THE LEFT GUARD
[ct=5332.275] PULLING.
[ct=5332.275] NOW YOU’RE IN A
[ct=5334.631] SITUATION YOU KNOW
[ct=5335.454] WHAT’S COMING NEXT.
[ct=5336.666] >> Kirk: OH, YEAH,
[ct=5337.847] ABSOLUTELY.
[ct=5339.745] NOT ONLY IS DICKERSON
[ct=5341.807] PULLING AROUND BUT THE
[ct=5344.245] CENTER, WE USED TO SEE
[ct=5345.352] JASON KELCE DOING
[ct=5347.855] EVEN THE ELBOW IS
[ct=5350.527] >> Al: HERE COMES YOUR
[ct=5354.743] BROTHERLY SHOVE.
[ct=5354.743] EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT’S
[ct=5357.560] COMING.
[ct=5362.128] HURTS GOING TO GET IN.
[ct=5362.395] AND TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=5369.027] THAT’S A 76-YARD
[ct=5369.884] DRIVE.
[ct=5371.866] 11 PLAYS.
[ct=5372.305] AND PHILLY HAS THE
[ct=5373.819] LEAD FOR THE
[ct=5376.761] WHAT’S COMING BUT YOU
[ct=5379.345] JUST CAN’T STOP IT.
[ct=5381.338] FRANKIE LUVU, WHO
[ct=5384.361] WE’VE BEEN TALKING
[ct=5384.361] ABOUT ALL NIGHT,
[ct=5386.065] YOU’LL SEE HIM JUST
[ct=5387.477] JUMP.
[ct=5388.132] HE JUMPS RIGHT THERE
[ct=5389.155] TRYING TO DO ANYTHING.
[ct=5391.038] THE PROBLEM IS HE’S
[ct=5391.038] UNDERNEATH ALL OF THAT
[ct=5393.678] AND EASILY GETS INTO
[ct=5393.916] THE END ZONE.
[ct=5395.025] GOOD PUSH ONCE AGAIN
[ct=5397.148] UP FRONT LED BY CAM
[ct=5398.583] JURGENS.
[ct=5399.181] >> Al: THE ONLY TEAM
[ct=5400.864] ABLE TO STOP HIM THIS
[ct=5403.900] YEAR HAS BEEN GREEN
[ct=5404.314] BAY, AND THEY WERE
[ct=5406.140] ABLE TO DO IT.
[ct=5410.196] STOPPED HIM TWICE.
[ct=5412.574] ELLIOTT TO THE POINT
[ct=5414.518] AFTER.
[ct=5421.447] AND, BOY, I’M TELLING
[ct=5422.905] YOU NO!
[ct=5424.261] EXACTLY 12 MINUTES
[ct=5426.557] >> Al: EAGLES WITH THE
[ct=5428.115] LEAD, BUT JAKE
[ct=5430.071] ELLIOTT, A NIGHT TO
[ct=5431.348] FORGET.
[ct=5433.862] HIS FIRST FIELD GOAL
[ct=5435.539] ATTEMPT WIDE LEFT.
[ct=5437.479] HIS SECOND FIELD GOAL
[ct=5439.741] ATTEMPT.
[ct=5440.233] >> Kirk: WIDE LEFT.
[ct=5440.735] >> Al: YEP.
[ct=5441.342] NOW YOU’VE GOT AN
[ct=5445.090] EXTRA POINT.
[ct=5446.582] HELLO AGAIN,
[ct=5448.307] EVERYBODY.
[ct=5449.518] SO THERE’S 7 POINTS
[ct=5450.339] THAT NEVER MADE IT TO
[ct=5451.877] THE SCOREBOARD.
[ct=5454.078] >> Kirk: MY GUY PAT
[ct=5456.806] McAFEE TEXTED ME
[ct=5457.428] SAYING WE HAVE BETTER
[ct=5458.725] KICKS WITH THE KICKING
[ct=5460.706] CONTEST.
[ct=5462.397] >> Al: ON GAME DAY.
[ct=5463.077] EKELER BACK TO THE 30.
[ct=5464.177] >> Kirk: WELL, LET’S
[ct=5464.754] TAKE A LOOK AT A
[ct=5466.623] MATCHUP WE WERE TRYING
[ct=5470.266] TO SEE.
[ct=5474.510] THAT’S TARYN McLAURIN
[ct=5477.037] AGAINST MITCHELL.
[ct=5477.037] 17 DOESN’T HAVE AN
[ct=5477.671] OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=5479.125] IT’S BEEN A LOCK DOWN.
[ct=5480.810] MITCHELL HAS DONE A
[ct=5480.810] GOOD JOB.
[ct=5481.716] HE’S PRESSED HIM,
[ct=5482.974] MIXED UP DIFFERENT
[ct=5483.575] LOOKS.
[ct=5484.646] HE’S BEEN ON HIM QUITE
[ct=5486.345] A BIT.
[ct=5486.345] PLAYED SOME DOUBLE,
[ct=5488.579] PLAYED SOME MANNED.
[ct=5490.351] POWERED BY AWS, LOOK
[ct=5494.611] AT THE NUMBERS.
[ct=5501.250] 27.3% PRESS RATE FOR
[ct=5504.075] AL, AND SAYS ZERO
[ct=5506.794] >> Al: THROWS, THAT’S
[ct=5514.777] 9-YARD GAIN.
[ct=5516.648] THAT’S JOHN SPATES,
[ct=5517.884] FIRST TIME THEY’VE
[ct=5520.947] GAUP HIS WAY.
[ct=5523.960] >> Kirk: IN PITTSBURGH
[ct=5524.215] THEY WERE UP 10,
[ct=5525.637] UNABLE TO CLOSE IT
[ct=5525.914] OFF.
[ct=5526.532] HERE ON THE ROAD A
[ct=5528.910] WEEK LATER AGAINST
[ct=5529.156] PHILADELPHIA, WANT TO
[ct=5530.131] PLAY WITH THE BIG
[ct=5530.131] BOYS, YOU’VE GOT TO
[ct=5530.715] FINISH THESE GAMES
[ct=5532.184] >> Al: ROBINSON PICKS
[ct=5533.562] UP ENOUGH FOR A FIRST
[ct=5534.966] TACKLE THERE BY
[ct=5537.633] BRANDON GRAHAM 11:20
[ct=5538.618] AND SECOND DOWN IN
[ct=5540.447] REGULATION.
[ct=5541.035] >> Kirk: REMEMBER YOU
[ct=5547.998] GO BACK TO ’22.
[ct=5549.635] THIS EAGLES DEFENSE
[ct=5552.219] SINCE 1922, 19-5 IN
[ct=5553.982] ONE POSSESSION GAMES.
[ct=5555.541] THAT’S THE BEST IN THE
[ct=5555.541] NFL.
[ct=5557.902] THEY KNOW HOW TO WIN
[ct=5558.355] THESE KIND OF CLOSE
[ct=5563.811] >> Al: BEEN THERE,
[ct=5565.456] ALL.
[ct=5565.895] AND THE PASS IS
[ct=5569.262] DROPPED.
[ct=5574.533] AND BATES AGAIN MADE
[ct=5574.766] THE LAST CATCH.
[ct=5576.115] >> Kirk: HE’S TRYING
[ct=5577.082] TO WAIT UNTIL THE LAST
[ct=5578.553] SECOND.
[ct=5580.366] AND GOT THE ABILITY TO
[ct=5581.151] PLAY THESE UNUSUAL,
[ct=5582.075] OFF BALANCE CHANGING
[ct=5583.255] THE ARM ANGLE THROWS,
[ct=5584.103] BUT HE’S FALLEN BACK
[ct=5588.140] ON A LOT OF THROWS.
[ct=5589.194] AND PHILADELPHIA,
[ct=5589.467] THEY’VE COME UP WITH
[ct=5590.345] WAYS TO GET HIM
[ct=5591.378] DISRUPTED.
[ct=5591.895] HE’S GOT TO PLAY A
[ct=5592.883] TICK FASTER THAN HE
[ct=5594.444] HAS MOST OF THE NIGHT
[ct=5595.017] WHEN HE’S BEEN
[ct=5596.858] THROWING THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=5600.722] AND THAT IS CAUGHT IN
[ct=5601.690] EAGLE TERRITORY.
[ct=5605.975] THEY GO TO ERTZ.
[ct=5606.265] SO ONCE AGAIN IT’S A
[ct=5607.884] TIGHT END OR A BACK HE
[ct=5610.077] GOES TO.
[ct=5610.978] HE’S COMPLETED 11
[ct=5612.700] TONIGHT, ONLY ONE FOR
[ct=5613.452] A WHITE OUT.
[ct=5615.783] >> Kirk: NAKOBE DEAN
[ct=5616.362] TO DANIELS.
[ct=5617.115] HE’S WAITING FOR
[ct=5618.686] ROBINSON TO COME OUT
[ct=5619.660] OF THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=5620.517] A LITTLE BIT LATE IN
[ct=5622.622] SCENE.
[ct=5622.906] >> Al: ROLLING,
[ct=5623.826] THROWING, ALONG THE
[ct=5626.364] SIDELINE, AND FINALLY
[ct=5628.675] McLAURIN TARGETED AND
[ct=5629.887] MAKES THE GRAB.
[ct=5630.717] >> Kirk: INSTEAD OF ON
[ct=5631.672] THE LEFT, MOVE HIM
[ct=5633.067] OVER TO THE RIGHT TO
[ct=5635.724] GO UP AGAINST ANOTHER
[ct=5638.724] ROOKIE, COOPER DeJEAN
[ct=5639.849] IN BACK-TO-BACK THROWS
[ct=5641.095] WHERE YOU SEE JAYDEN
[ct=5642.786] DANIELS THROWING THE
[ct=5644.183] BALL WITH AUTHORITY.
[ct=5645.613] BALL’S OUT FASTER,
[ct=5647.360] BALL’S CRISPR, GIVING
[ct=5649.291] HIS RECEIVERS A MUCH
[ct=5650.396] BETTER CHANCE TO MAKE
[ct=5654.567] A PLAY.
[ct=5654.816] >> Al: McLAURIN 48
[ct=5656.287] CATCHES AND A
[ct=5657.769] OFF THE FACE.
[ct=5659.278] TO THE OUTSIDE THEY GO
[ct=5661.746] HERE, AND THIS TIME IT
[ct=5664.040] IS JOHN BATES AGAIN.
[ct=5666.002] THE NUMBER TWO TIGHT
[ct=5667.037] END HAS CAUGHT A
[ct=5670.366] COUPLE.
[ct=5670.687] >> Kirk: BATES HASN’T
[ct=5671.673] MADE PLAYS ALL YEAR IN
[ct=5672.443] THE PASS GAME.
[ct=5673.323] HE IS A PHYSICAL
[ct=5674.587] BLOCKER, AND I THINK
[ct=5674.973] THE LAST COUPLE OF
[ct=5676.254] PLAYS I THINK
[ct=5676.694] PHILADELPHIA’S
[ct=5677.639] DEFENSE, IT’S ALMOST
[ct=5679.094] LIKE THEY’RE NOT EVEN
[ct=5680.254] ANTICIPATING HIM BEING
[ct=5682.238] INVOLVED IN THE ROUTE.
[ct=5683.269] BOTH TIMES HE WAS --
[ct=5685.255] HE WAS OPEN AND A GOOD
[ct=5686.794] JOB.
[ct=5687.084] ONCE AGAIN DANIELS
[ct=5687.993] THIRD THROW IN A ROW
[ct=5690.744] AND THE BALL COMES OUT
[ct=5690.990] QUICK.
[ct=5692.404] >> Al: BATES CAUGHT
[ct=5694.018] ONLY THREE COMING INTO
[ct=5698.246] THE GAME ALL SEASON.
[ct=5698.246] ROBINSON, NO.
[ct=5699.668] MAN IN THE BACKFIELD
[ct=5706.922] THAT TIME.
[ct=5706.922] JALEN CARTER TAKES HIM
[ct=5708.456] >> Kirk: CARTER
[ct=5709.006] BECOMING ONE OF THE
[ct=5712.259] NOW IN THE NFL.
[ct=5712.439] SEE HOW HE USES HIS
[ct=5716.723] HANDS, EYES
[ct=5718.483] HE PLAYS IT ALMOST
[ct=5719.100] LIKE A LINEBACKER WITH
[ct=5720.182] HIS INSTINCTS AND MIX
[ct=5721.292] IN THE POWER AND
[ct=5722.271] QUICKNESS HE HAS TO GO
[ct=5722.917] WITH IT.
[ct=5723.684] REALLY IN THE SECOND
[ct=5724.345] YEAR START TO TAKE
[ct=5724.960] CONTROL OF THE
[ct=5728.373] INTERIOR THIS DEFENSE.
[ct=5731.158] >> Al: 3rd DOWN AND 1.
[ct=5732.837] SO THREE TIGHT ENDS
[ct=5735.682] ROBINSON IN THE
[ct=5740.915] ROBINSON, NO, SIR.
[ct=5741.480] SO NOW YOU’VE GOT A
[ct=5743.575] 4th DOWN COMING UP
[ct=5746.108] WITH 8:30 LEFT IN
[ct=5747.019] YOU’VE GOT GRAHAM
[ct=5748.862] THERE, YOU’VE GOT BAUN
[ct=5750.552] IN FACT, THEY’VE LOST
[ct=5751.365] A YARD.
[ct=5753.504] 4th AND A DEUCE.
[ct=5754.557] >> Kirk: SUCH RHYTHM
[ct=5755.646] IN THIS DRIVE UNTIL
[ct=5756.637] THAT PLAY.
[ct=5757.825] LOOKED BACK AT
[ct=5758.832] ROBINSON, AND JUST
[ct=5759.727] LOOKED LIKE IT WAS A
[ct=5761.114] LITTLE BIT SLOW AND
[ct=5763.011] DELIBERATE, AND IT
[ct=5763.167] GAVE PHILADELPHIA A
[ct=5764.239] CHANCE TO DIG THEIR
[ct=5765.134] CLEATS INTO THE GROUND
[ct=5766.291] THERE AND GET OFF THE
[ct=5768.283] BALL.
[ct=5768.880] >> Al: GONZALEZ IF
[ct=5769.860] THEY DON’T GET A YARD
[ct=5771.732] HERE, HE’S GOT ABOUT A
[ct=5773.109] 43-YARD ATTEMPT TO
[ct=5774.638] TAKE THE LEAD.
[ct=5776.444] OH, BOY, JUGGLED IT.
[ct=5777.741] LUCKY HE CAME AWAY
[ct=5779.554] AND THEN HE GETS
[ct=5780.578] SLAMMED OUT OF BOUNDS
[ct=5782.652] SHORT OF THE FIRST
[ct=5784.930] AT FIRST IT LOOKED
[ct=5786.215] LIKE HE WAS GOING TO
[ct=5787.187] FUMBLE IT.
[ct=5794.694] BAUN HITS HIM, AND ITS
[ct=5796.763] AND LOOK AT THAT,
[ct=5798.123] >> Kirk: WELL, THE
[ct=5799.547] DECISION TO GO FOR IT,
[ct=5801.124] WE’LL TALK ABOUT IT IN
[ct=5802.928] A SECOND, BUT WATCH
[ct=5804.221] BAUN WORK OFF OF THIS,
[ct=5805.489] OFF TO THE EDGE.
[ct=5806.560] REALLY GOOD JOB THERE.
[ct=5809.394] THE ONE QUESTION I
[ct=5809.711] HAVE NOAH BROWN,
[ct=5810.775] BLOCKING PLAY, HE ENDS
[ct=5811.829] UP MAKING A TACKLE AND
[ct=5812.845] FELT PRESSURE FROM THE
[ct=5813.518] INSIDE FROM
[ct=5814.709] BLANKENSHIP, SO HE
[ct=5816.062] TRIES TO BLOCK.
[ct=5816.337] NOT ABLE TO MAKE THAT
[ct=5818.887] BLOCK, AND AL, YOU
[ct=5820.575] CALLED IT ON THE LIVE
[ct=5821.076] CALL, THE PLAY NEVER
[ct=5822.252] HAD A CHANCE THERE.
[ct=5823.301] THE BALL GETS AWAY,
[ct=5825.679] CARTER’S IN THE
[ct=5827.296] HE’S JUST TRYING TO
[ct=5828.268] IMPROVISE TO MAKE A
[ct=5830.653] THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A
[ct=5832.155] 45-YARD FIELD GOAL TO
[ct=5835.135] >> Al: AND EVEN THOUGH
[ct=5837.984] GONZALEZ IS THE KICKER
[ct=5841.023] WHO CAME IN -- HASN’T
[ct=5842.684] MISSED A KICK IN TWO
[ct=5842.684] WEEKS.
[ct=5853.250] AGAINST PITTSBURGH.
[ct=5856.017] >> Kirk: BIG POINT IN
[ct=5856.641] THE GAME HERE.
[ct=5857.410] WASHINGTON ROLLS THE
[ct=5859.373] DICE, CHANCE TO TAKE
[ct=5860.268] THE LEAD.
[ct=5862.894] DAN QUINN GETS
[ct=5863.379] AGGRESSIVE.
[ct=5863.921] PLAY BLOWS UP NOW.
[ct=5864.541] WASHINGTON RELYING ON
[ct=5866.408] THEIR DEFENSE TO TRY
[ct=5867.295] TO GIVE JAYDEN DANIELS
[ct=5869.262] THE BALL BACK, AND
[ct=5872.547] PHILLY A CHANCE TO
[ct=5876.229] WORK SOME CLOCK HERE.
[ct=5881.466] >> Al: OFF THE FAKE,
[ct=5883.285] AND FINALLY HAS A TON
[ct=5883.452] OF TIME.
[ct=5884.631] AND WIDE OPEN.
[ct=5885.572] PASS IS MADE.
[ct=5886.888] LOSES THE BALL.
[ct=5888.279] BUT THE EAGLES ARE
[ct=5890.012] THERE TO RECOVER IT.
[ct=5890.544] KNOCKED OUT BY QUAN
[ct=5892.730] MARTIN.
[ct=5895.406] AND GOEDERT TOSSED THE
[ct=5896.995] BALL AND GRANT
[ct=5898.509] THE DAY.
[ct=5899.513] DOES HE EVER.
[ct=5901.344] >> Kirk: DOES HE EVER.
[ct=5901.344] EFFORT THERE.
[ct=5904.747] FROM HIS BODY.
[ct=5906.021] SMART PLAY THERE TO
[ct=5906.301] KNOCK THAT FOOTBALL
[ct=5907.641] AWAY BY MARTIN.
[ct=5908.191] LOOKS LIKE THE
[ct=5913.582] COMMANDERS GOT A SHOT,
[ct=5913.874] BUT RIGHT WHERE HE
[ct=5914.735] NEEDS TO BE TO HELP
[ct=5915.742] HIS TEAMMATE OUT.
[ct=5917.626] UNDERNEATH COVERAGE
[ct=5917.985] TOOK ALL THE
[ct=5919.928] UNDERNEATH ROUTES LED
[ct=5920.625] BY SAQUON BARKLEY,
[ct=5923.885] OPENED IT UP OVER TOP.
[ct=5924.297] >> Al: THEY GO TO
[ct=5926.893] THEIR WORKHORSE AGAIN.
[ct=5928.778] STOPPED AT THE LINE OF
[ct=5929.739] SCRIMMAGE AND MAYBE A
[ct=5932.773] FEW INCHES BEYOND.
[ct=5934.788] 2nd DOWN.
[ct=5940.684] >> Kirk: GOEDERT AND
[ct=5945.267] CALCTERRA GOOD
[ct=5946.200] BUDDIES.
[ct=5946.869] COMMANDERS ARE IN THAT
[ct=5947.446] MODE.
[ct=5948.047] THEY’RE TRYING TO
[ct=5948.650] KNOCK ANYTHING THEY
[ct=5949.614] CAN AWAY FROM THE
[ct=5951.968] EAGLES.
[ct=5954.817] >> Al: UNDER 6 MINUTES
[ct=5958.134] LEFT IN REGULATION.
[ct=5966.268] 2nd DOWN 9.
[ct=5967.058] HURTS FIRES,
[ct=5969.086] CONTESTED, AND CAUGHT
[ct=5970.131] BY BROWN.
[ct=5974.010] BROWN ON THE OUTSIDE
[ct=5975.884] SAINRISITIL MAKING THE
[ct=5977.498] GRAB, DOING A GOOD JOB
[ct=5979.062] THAT GAIN 6 YARDS AND
[ct=5980.455] A 3rd DOWN AND 3.
[ct=5981.426] >> Kirk: INTERESTING
[ct=5982.955] CALL HERE BECAUSE THEY
[ct=5984.340] GOT POSITIVE YARDS 3rd
[ct=5985.293] AND 3.
[ct=5986.877] UP BY 2, IN FIELD GOAL
[ct=5988.999] RANGE WITH A SHAKY
[ct=5990.606] KICKER.
[ct=5991.312] YOU WONDER WHAT KIND
[ct=5992.283] OF PLAY CALL YOU GO
[ct=5993.725] WITH HERE, JUST TO
[ct=5994.830] POTENTIALLY SETUP.
[ct=5999.463] THEY GET TO THAT
[ct=6000.618] AND 1, 1 NF.
[ct=6001.160] YOU KNOW THEY’RE
[ct=6002.562] ALWAYS CONFIDENT HOW
[ct=6002.777] THEY CAN PICK UP THAT
[ct=6007.181] >> Al: AND THE BALL IS
[ct=6008.322] ON THE GROUND, AND
[ct=6013.178] FIRST DOWN AND MOORE.
[ct=6014.737] BARKLEY TOUCHDOWN!
[ct=6035.745] >> Kirk: PHILADELPHIA
[ct=6036.430] MAKES DAN QUINN AND
[ct=6037.381] WASHINGTON PAY FOR
[ct=6038.472] THAT CHANCE THEY TOOK.
[ct=6039.207] WATCH THE RIGHT TACKLE
[ct=6040.910] WITH A GREAT KICKOUT
[ct=6042.445] BLOCK HERE BY LANE
[ct=6044.607] THE ENTIRE RIGHT SIDE
[ct=6045.769] HERE DOES THEIR JOB.
[ct=6049.573] ALSO THIS CENTER CAM
[ct=6059.689] JARGONS CREATING THAT.
[ct=6061.113] >> Al: IMPORTANT PLAY
[ct=6062.529] MEANWHILE, THE ICING
[ct=6063.583] ON THE CAKE FOR
[ct=6065.800] BARKLEY, HE NOW HAS
[ct=6067.500] 100 YARDS TONIGHT.
[ct=6075.854] AND THERE’S THE LASTD THAT SHOT.
[ct=6076.878] >> Kirk: DUDE, YOU
[ct=6077.397] SAVED ME.
[ct=6079.171] THANK YOU.
[ct=6079.973] >> Al: ONE TIGHT END
[ct=6080.696] SAVING THE BACON OF
[ct=6081.312] THE OTHER.
[ct=6082.531] TOUCH BACK HERE.
[ct=6083.413] WASHINGTON AT THE 30
[ct=6085.770] YARD LINE NEXT.
[ct=6090.371] IN HIS SECOND YEAR IS
[ct=6091.149] CAPABLE OF TAKING
[ct=6093.005] GAMES OVER.
[ct=6094.452] WHAT THE COACHES CALL
[ct=6094.881] A GAME RECORD.
[ct=6095.265] NO MATTER WHO’S
[ct=6098.291] PLAYING THE EAGLES,
[ct=6098.716] THEY’RE GOING TO LOOK
[ct=6100.755] UP AND SAY WHERE’S 98?
[ct=6101.041] HE’S GOTTEN
[ct=6102.020] COMFORTABLE.
[ct=6104.138] HE KNOWS HIS ROLE.
[ct=6104.138] THEY’RE TAKING
[ct=6105.758] ADVANTAGE OF HIM JUST
[ct=6107.515] BEING A MENACE ON THE
[ct=6108.964] HE’S INVOLVED IN A
[ct=6111.566] HE CANNOT BE BLOCKED
[ct=6111.989] ONE-ON-ONE.
[ct=6112.426] I THINK ONE OF THE TOP
[ct=6113.805] INTERIOR DEFENSIVE
[ct=6114.143] LINEMEN IN THE
[ct=6114.978] NATIONAL FOOTBALL
[ct=6118.076] LEAGUE RIGHT NOW.
[ct=6118.706] >> Al: NUMBER ONE
[ct=6119.230] OVERALL PICK LAST
[ct=6121.598] SO COMMANDERS DOWN BY
[ct=6122.881] 9.
[ct=6123.743] DANIELS FIRES OVER THE
[ct=6129.099] MIDDLE.
[ct=6130.179] AND REED BLANKENSHIP,
[ct=6132.350] WHO FOR THE MOMENT HAS
[ct=6132.350] AWARDED THE
[ct=6133.420] INTERCESSION.
[ct=6134.089] AND THEY’RE GOING TO
[ct=6135.313] GO CELEBRATE.
[ct=6135.951] OF COURSE THEY’LL TAKE
[ct=6137.370] A PEEK AT IT.
[ct=6139.980] THE SMILING SIRIANNI.
[ct=6140.511] AND DANIELS OF ALL
[ct=6142.346] THINGS ON A FIRST
[ct=6145.696] PLAY, DOWN BY 9 IS
[ct=6147.081] PICKED OFF.
[ct=6149.580] HERE IT IS AGAIN.
[ct=6151.423] >> Kirk: NICE
[ct=6158.237] >> Kirk: NOAH BROWN IS
[ct=6158.452] RIGHT HERE.
[ct=6159.829] AND THIS IS JAYDEN
[ct=6160.571] DANIELS TRYING TO MAKE
[ct=6162.135] I THINK HE’S STARING
[ct=6162.707] DOWN HIS RECEIVER THE
[ct=6163.563] WHOLE WAY, AND
[ct=6165.066] BLANKENSHIP WAITING
[ct=6165.573] FOR THE BALL TO BE
[ct=6166.547] THROWN, AND JUST STEPS
[ct=6167.419] IN FRONT OF
[ct=6169.956] THIS DEFENSE I THINK
[ct=6170.444] HAS GAINED CONFIDENCE
[ct=6171.273] THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.
[ct=6172.349] THEY’VE DONE A HECK OF
[ct=6179.910] A JOB WITH VIC FANGIO.
[ct=6181.551] AND REMINDING ALL OF
[ct=6181.551] US TONIGHT TONIGHT
[ct=6182.420] HE’S LOOKED LIKE A
[ct=6184.656] ROOKIE QUARTERBACK
[ct=6185.435] AGAINST A VETERAN
[ct=6185.945] DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR.
[ct=6186.438] HE WAS HAVING SOME FUN
[ct=6188.051] DOWN THERE.
[ct=6189.836] >> Al: FOR SURE.
[ct=6191.606] BLANKENSHIP NOW HAS
[ct=6192.912] THREE OF THEIR SEVEN
[ct=6193.719] INTERCEPTIONS THIS
[ct=6198.156] DANIELS ONLY T
[ct=6198.707] HIS THIRD.
[ct=6199.188] HERE’S BARKLEY ALREADY
[ct=6201.600] INTO TRIPLE FIGURES.
[ct=6202.391] WE GO TO KAYLEE.
[ct=6203.705] >> GUYS, THAT PICK
[ct=6205.357] MAKES 11 TAKE-AWAYS IN
[ct=6205.930] THE LAST FOUR GAMES.
[ct=6207.539] AND JUST BEFORE THIS
[ct=6209.363] SURGE BEGAN, INSIDE
[ct=6211.824] LINEBACKER COACH BOBBY
[ct=6213.577] KING SHOWED THE
[ct=6214.644] DEFENSE LET THE
[ct=6216.634] SURFERS HIT BIG WAVES.
[ct=6217.503] HE WAS TELLING THEM
[ct=6218.925] WE’VE GOT TO CATCH THE
[ct=6220.733] WAVES AFTER TWO
[ct=6221.497] TAKE-AWAYS IN THE
[ct=6226.449] FIRST SIX GAMES, ZACK
[ct=6228.835] BAUN TOLD ME NOW THEY
[ct=6230.767] HAVE CAUGHT THE WAVE.
[ct=6232.385] >> Al: I’VE NEVER
[ct=6236.741] HEARD THAT BEFORE.
[ct=6237.327] SURFING MOVIES.
[ct=6238.368] >> Kirk: I GUESS
[ct=6242.906] SURFING MOVIES WIN
[ct=6244.708] OVER SHARK WEEK.
[ct=6245.575] >> Al: A LITTLE AROUND
[ct=6246.278] HIM, A BIT OF
[ct=6247.596] CONSOLATION.
[ct=6248.006] SAYING, MAN, YOU’RE
[ct=6248.928] GOING TO HAVE DAYS
[ct=6250.571] LIKE THIS.
[ct=6250.958] DOWN BY 9 NOW IN THE
[ct=6252.337] BATTLE FOR FIRST
[ct=6253.727] PLACE.
[ct=6254.440] BARKLEY, DOES HE HAVE
[ct=6255.324] ANOTHER ONE?
[ct=6262.423] YES, HE DOES.
[ct=6262.423] TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=6264.099] 39 YARDS TO THE
[ct=6271.022] LAST THREE DRIVES THEY
[ct=6273.161] HAVE BEEN UNSTOPPABLE.
[ct=6276.491] AND SAQUON NOW ALL OF
[ct=6278.351] A SUDDEN 146 YARDS.
[ct=6278.770] >> Kirk: THAT’S WHY
[ct=6282.382] IT’S A 60-MINUTE GAME.
[ct=6282.919] WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
[ct=6284.689] YOU SAW SAQUON BARKLEY
[ct=6286.160] HAVE THAT KIND OF
[ct=6287.184] ENERGY?
[ct=6287.734] AND JUST FOR FUN THE
[ct=6291.410] GUY WHO REPLACED JASON
[ct=6291.410] KELCE HAVING A GOOD
[ct=6293.055] HE JUST BODY SLAMS THE
[ct=6295.422] SAFETY TRYING TO COME
[ct=6297.847] UP THERE.
[ct=6298.402] AND SAQUON BARKLEY GOT
[ct=6300.372] TO PLAY 60 MINUTES TO
[ct=6300.372] STOP THIS GUY.
[ct=6301.704] EVEN OFF TO A SLOW
[ct=6302.913] START, HE AND THIS
[ct=6303.792] OFFENSE WILL KEEP
[ct=6306.735] COMING AFTER YOU.
[ct=6307.556] >> Al: WHAT’S FUNNY,
[ct=6308.749] 146 YARDS AND IT’S
[ct=6309.646] ONLY HIS FOURTH
[ct=6310.618] HIGHEST YARDAGE TOTAL
[ct=6311.594] ON THE GROUND THIS
[ct=6316.815] THINK ABOUT THAT.
[ct=6318.261] EYES.
[ct=6318.665] I HAVEN’T SEEN HIM
[ct=6319.562] LOOK LIKE THIS IN A
[ct=6320.805] LONG TIME.
[ct=6325.208] HE’S ON A MISSION.
[ct=6325.589] >> Al: EXTRA POINT
[ct=6327.802] THIS TIME AND RIGHT
[ct=6331.222] DOWN THE MIDDLE.
[ct=6331.581] 4:38 TO GO
[ct=6332.851] HAVING ANOTHER BIG
[ct=6333.785] NIGHT TONIGHT.
[ct=6334.571] GIANTS FANS SITTING
[ct=6335.718] THERE SAYING YOU’RE
[ct=6337.077] KILLING US, YOU’RE
[ct=6337.588] KILLING US.
[ct=6338.779] STOP IT.
[ct=6339.446] >> Kirk: PUT HIM DOWN
[ct=6340.225] THERE WITH THE
[ct=6343.406] OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=6344.527] WHAT EVERY RUN BACK
[ct=6345.454] SHOULD DO.
[ct=6345.815] LET’S TALK ABOUT THIS
[ct=6348.007] SOME NEW FACES UP
[ct=6349.432] DICKERSON WAS DOWN
[ct=6350.700] WITH AN INJURY.
[ct=6351.889] CAME RIGHT BACK THE
[ct=6353.841] NEXT SIRIS.
[ct=6355.401] JOHNSON HAVING A PRO
[ct=6356.725] BOWL TYPE OF YEAR.
[ct=6357.652] SAM JURGENS HAS DONE A
[ct=6359.520] WE’VE TALKED A LOT
[ct=6363.574] ABOUT HIM TONIGHT, THE
[ct=6365.033] CENTER.
[ct=6367.295] NOW BACK IN PHILLY
[ct=6368.295] PLAYING GUARD.
[ct=6369.111] JURGENS BODY SLAMMED
[ct=6370.001] THE SAFETY, SENDING AN
[ct=6372.887] ATTITUDE AND BEEN A
[ct=6373.692] BENEFICIARY ALL YEAR
[ct=6375.271] TO THE WAY THOSE GUYS
[ct=6377.147] PLAY UP FRONT.
[ct=6377.383] THERE’S SAQUON BARKLEY
[ct=6380.093] AND ONE OF THE BEST
[ct=6381.668] LINE COACHES, BEEN
[ct=6383.611] DOING IT A LONG TIME.
[ct=6383.975] >> Al: AND WHEN YOU
[ct=6387.386] THINK ABOUT IT, YEARS
[ct=6388.457] AGO,
[ct=6391.061] HOW IMPORTANT HAVE
[ct=6392.022] THOSE GUYS BEEN TO
[ct=6392.376] THEIR TEAM THROUGH THE
[ct=6395.268] YEARS?
[ct=6396.768] >> Kirk: THINK ABOUT
[ct=6399.739] WHEN YOU LOSE JASON
[ct=6404.059] KELCE, HEART AND SOUL.
[ct=6405.734] THEY’VE HAD TO BOB AND
[ct=6407.342] WEAVE.
[ct=6407.342] THEY’RE HEALTHY AND
[ct=6408.623] SHOWING WHAT THEY’RE
[ct=6410.047] CAPABLE OF.
[ct=6412.476] GOES NOWHERE.
[ct=6413.717] CLOCK CONTINUES TO
[ct=6414.202] RUN.
[ct=6416.183] BAUN MAKES THE TACKLE.
[ct=6416.183] CLOCK RUNNING DOWN TO
[ct=6417.605] 4 MINUTES LEFT IN
[ct=6420.794] AND THE COMMANDERS ARE
[ct=6423.017] 1 OUT OF 9 ON THIRD
[ct=6424.514] DOWN TONIGHT AND OF
[ct=6425.289] COURSE LEADS TO A LOT
[ct=6429.492] OF PUNTS.
[ct=6436.343] 3rd AND 2.
[ct=6437.154] DANIELS THROWS, FLAG
[ct=6438.128] IS THROWN.
[ct=6439.223] THAT’S ONE-HANDED FOR
[ct=6441.740] THE MOMENT BY ERTZ,
[ct=6442.988] BUT THEN HE SAYS NO.
[ct=6447.672] CHECK OUT THE FLAG.
[ct=6461.035] AND THE ANSWER
[ct=6462.595] >> Referee: THERE’S
[ct=6467.025] NOW FOUL IN PLAY FOR
[ct=6468.820] OFFENSE PASS
[ct=6469.877] INTERFERENCE.
[ct=6470.936] >> Kirk: YEAH, THIS
[ct=6471.834] DEFENSE THEY ALLOWED
[ct=6473.331] THE ONE TOUCHDOWN
[ct=6475.503] EARLY IN THIS GAME.
[ct=6476.265] YOU ADD UP SINCE
[ct=6477.251] THEY’VE BEEN ON THIS
[ct=6478.380] RUN OF WINNING FIVE IN
[ct=6480.609] A ROW, NOW IT’S GOING
[ct=6482.641] TO BE SIX IN A ROW.
[ct=6484.207] 6-0 THESE LAST SIX
[ct=6485.910] WEEKS, ALLOWS FIVE
[ct=6486.288] TOUCHDOWNS TOTAL AS
[ct=6487.569] THE DEFENSE IN THOSE
[ct=6492.091] SIX WEEKS.
[ct=6495.134] >> Al: SO THE PASS TO
[ct=6497.325] ERTZ WAS GOOD FOR 4
[ct=6497.727] YARDS, AND THAT’S
[ct=6499.197] ENOUGH FOR A FIRST
[ct=6505.217] SO ALL NIGHT LIKE GOES
[ct=6505.551] TO ZACCHEAUS THAT
[ct=6506.547] TIME.
[ct=6508.568] SO DANIELS 16 OF 25.
[ct=6511.177] YOU GO BACK TO THE 16
[ct=6512.626] COMPLETIONS AND
[ct=6514.182] ANOTHER MASTERFUL
[ct=6515.731] PERFORMANCE.
[ct=6518.462] AND ONLY TWO OF THEM,
[ct=6521.733] ONE FOR McLAURIN FOR
[ct=6523.124] 10 YARDS.
[ct=6524.640] ONE TO DYAMI BROWN FOR
[ct=6526.263] 2 YARDS.
[ct=6528.410] THE ONLY WIDE OUT TO
[ct=6530.192] CAS CASS PASSES
[ct=6532.055] >> Kirk: THE JOB HE’S
[ct=6532.876] DONE ESPECIALLY THE
[ct=6534.491] LAST SIX WEEKS HAS
[ct=6536.816] BEEN EXTRAORDINARY.
[ct=6537.309] >> Al: AND THAT PASS
[ct=6537.823] IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=6538.926] >> Kirk: WE’VE GOT A
[ct=6543.988] PENALTY DOWN RIGHT ON
[ct=6551.209] THE BACKFIELD THERE.
[ct=6552.715] >> Referee: PERSONAL
[ct=6552.894] FOUL, ROUGHING THE
[ct=6554.602] PASSER, DEFENSE NUMBER
[ct=6556.044] 97.
[ct=6557.504] 15-YARD PENALTY.
[ct=6561.560] AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
[ct=6563.279] >> Al: YOU LOOK AT
[ct=6563.541] WASHINGTON’S SCHEDULE.
[ct=6565.466] 4 OF THEIR LAST 6 ARE
[ct=6566.715] AT HOME AND HAD A
[ct=6570.526] BI-WEEK, WEEK 14 AS
[ct=6570.981] WELL.
[ct=6570.981] ONE OF THEIR GAMES
[ct=6573.618] AGAINST PHILLY
[ct=6574.661] TONIGHT, TWO AGAINST
[ct=6576.167] DALLAS.
[ct=6576.370] AND YOU SEE THE FOUL
[ct=6577.759] RIGHT THERE.
[ct=6578.581] MEANWHILE, PHILLY GETS
[ct=6580.590] TO PLAY FOUR OF THEIR
[ct=6581.018] LAST FIVE IN ALL.
[ct=6583.006] AND LAST TWO AGAINST
[ct=6583.543] THE GIANTS AND THE
[ct=6584.656] COWBOYS.
[ct=6586.263] HOW’S THAT LOOKING FOR
[ct=6588.081] THEM?
[ct=6589.118] >> Kirk: YOU KNOW,
[ct=6589.866] EVERYBODY’S ALMOST
[ct=6591.306] ASSUMING DETROIT IS
[ct=6592.409] GOING TO BE THE ONE
[ct=6594.915] SEED COMING OUT OF
[ct=6595.621] NFC.
[ct=6597.047] PHILLY IS SITTING HERE
[ct=6600.880] 8-2 WITH 7 TO GO.
[ct=6601.362] THEY STILL HAVE LOT OF
[ct=6602.331] GAMES AHEAD OF THEM
[ct=6603.196] AND GAMES THEY’RE
[ct=6604.190] GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE
[ct=6605.076] TO CONTINUE TO WIN.
[ct=6605.895] LISTEN, THEY DIDN’T
[ct=6607.226] PLAY THEIR GREATEST
[ct=6608.347] TONIGHT OFFENSIVELY.
[ct=6608.777] THEY FOUND WAYS TO GET
[ct=6610.215] IT DONE LATE.
[ct=6611.073] OFFENSIVE LINE TOOK
[ct=6612.973] OVER, BUT JUST ABOUT
[ct=6613.780] AS BAD THEY CAN PLAY
[ct=6614.670] OFFENSIVELY.
[ct=6618.747] AND THEY WON 26-10.
[ct=6619.564] >> Al: WELL, 3 POINTS
[ct=6620.378] AT HALF TIME.
[ct=6621.962] YOU GO BACK A MONTH
[ct=6623.740] AND A HALF.
[ct=6624.070] REMEMBER, LAST YEAR,
[ct=6624.580] OF COURSE YOU HAVE THE
[ct=6628.268] MELT DOWN.
[ct=6628.570] YOU TALK ABOUT THEY
[ct=6628.878] WERE GOING TO BE THE
[ct=6629.358] NUMBER ONE SEED AND
[ct=6630.428] GETTING BLOWN OUT IN
[ct=6632.073] THE WILD CARD ROUND.
[ct=6632.458] COMPLETE MELT DOWN AT
[ct=6634.018] THE END.
[ct=6637.567] THAT PASS IS CAUGHT
[ct=6638.487] AND ERTZ ON THE
[ct=6640.679] YOU CAN’T ASSUME
[ct=6643.324] ANYTHING THESE DAYS.
[ct=6644.347] 10-1 FOR THAT.
[ct=6646.582] IT’S FUNNY A MONTH AND
[ct=6647.892] A HALF AGO THEY’RE
[ct=6649.570] READY TO MAKE SIRIANNI
[ct=6651.154] A PINATA, READY TO
[ct=6652.380] BURN THE STADIUM DOWN,
[ct=6654.003] RIGHT?
[ct=6654.248] 2-2, TERRIBLE AGAINST
[ct=6655.734] TAMPA BAY.
[ct=6655.734] >> Kirk: DON’T YOU
[ct=6657.544] THINK THE EXPERIENCE
[ct=6657.544] LAST YEAR SITTING
[ct=6658.902] THERE LOSING THOSE
[ct=6659.275] GAMES AND LIMPING INTO
[ct=6660.316] THE WILD CARD GAME AND
[ct=6661.513] GETTING EMBARRASSED BY
[ct=6662.605] TAMPA, THE FAN
[ct=6663.251] REACTION, THE CHANGES
[ct=6664.621] THEY MADE STARTING
[ct=6666.275] 2-2, I JUST THINK IT’S
[ct=6666.974] MADE THEM TOUGHER.
[ct=6668.241] I THINK IT’S MADE THEM
[ct=6669.022] A TEAM AND YOU CAN GET
[ct=6670.262] THROUGH NIGHTS LIKE
[ct=6671.153] THIS, BUT YOU FIND
[ct=6674.592] WAYS TO WIN GAMES.
[ct=6674.592] THAT’S WHAT GREAT
[ct=6675.822] TEAMS DO.
[ct=6676.282] >> Al: AND OF COURSE
[ct=6676.915] THE CHANGE IN
[ct=6681.010] COORDINATORS.
[ct=6682.634] AND THEY WANTED NICK,
[ct=6686.249] BUT THEY WANTED FANGIO
[ct=6686.481] TO COME HERE.
[ct=6687.900] NICK LAST YEAR
[ct=6688.399] COULDN’T GET HIM.
[ct=6691.565] ALREADY SIGNED WITH
[ct=6691.565] MIAMI.
[ct=6692.207] THAT DIDN’T WORK OUT
[ct=6693.481] AND HE BECAME
[ct=6693.876] AVAILABLE, AND THEY
[ct=6694.675] POUNCED ON IT.
[ct=6703.921] AND WILL BE A FOURTH
[ct=6706.870] DOWN-PLAY COMING UP
[ct=6709.641] McNICHOLS AGAIN.
[ct=6714.223] THE 2-MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=6715.150] >> Kirk: LAST YEAR
[ct=6715.902] MIAMI, I DON’T KNOW
[ct=6720.149] THAT WAS A FIT AS FAR
[ct=6721.180] AS VIC FANGIO AND
[ct=6721.762] THEIR DEFENSE.
[ct=6722.453] THEY NEVER QUITE
[ct=6723.399] COMPLETELY BOUGHT INTO
[ct=6724.537] WHAT HE WAS TEACHING.
[ct=6725.894] THIS IS A YOUNG EAGLES
[ct=6728.647] IT’S GOING TO HIM
[ct=6729.213] EVERY WEEK WITH GIVE
[ct=6731.317] US THE WISDOM, WHAT DO
[ct=6732.496] WE NEED TO KNOW, HOW
[ct=6733.728] CAN YOU HELP US?
[ct=6735.855] A LOT OF THEM ARE JUST
[ct=6736.403] SPONGES WANTING TO
[ct=6737.852] LISTEN TO WHAT HE CAN
[ct=6738.342] OFFER
[ct=6740.294] I THINK THEY’VE ALL
[ct=6740.680] BOUGHT IN AND THE
[ct=6741.111] RESULTS SPEAK FOR
[ct=6744.528] THEMSELVES.
[ct=6745.702] >> Al: 2-MINUTE
[ct=6746.172] WARNING AND WE CAN
[ct=6749.097] TELL YOU THE JC PENNEY
[ct=6749.613] POST GAME SHOW
[ct=6753.660] EXCLUSIVELY ON PRIME
[ct=6755.165] VIDEO WITH CHARISSA
[ct=6756.231] AND THE FABLED GANG.
[ct=6757.085] WHERE DO YOU THINK
[ct=6758.200] THEY’RE HEADING
[ct=6759.233] TONIGHT?
[ct=6761.357] >> Kirk: I’D GO TO MY
[ct=6763.434] NEXT STOP AFTER THE
[ct=6769.099] GAME, THEY KEEP GOING.
[ct=6770.399] >> Al: YOU’LL BE IN
[ct=6772.365] ATHENS LATE INTO
[ct=6773.470] TONIGHT AND THEY’LL
[ct=6775.412] BE -- I DON’T KNOW.
[ct=6777.129] >> Kirk: LIBERTY BELL.
[ct=6777.624] >> Al: THEY WENT TO
[ct=6779.345] THAT LAST NIGHT.
[ct=6779.857] >> Kirk: YOU BROUGHT
[ct=6781.161] THIS UP, THE NFC EAST
[ct=6781.913] HAVEN’T HAD A REPEAT
[ct=6783.551] WINNER THE LAST 19
[ct=6784.727] DALLAS WON LAST YEAR,
[ct=6787.408] SO IT’S GOING
[ct=6793.045] LONGEST STREAK NFL,
[ct=6793.045] WNBA, MLS, YOU NAME
[ct=6794.001] IT, THERE’S NEVER BEEN
[ct=6795.209] A LEAGUE 20 STRAIGHT
[ct=6796.006] YEARS WHERE YOU HAVE A
[ct=6797.029] DIFFERENT WINNER.
[ct=6798.151] GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN
[ct=6801.151] >> Al: BACK-TO-BACK.
[ct=6801.641] LAST TIME IT WAS DONE
[ct=6805.583] THE EAGLES DID IT WON
[ct=6811.390] THROUGH ’04 CROWD
[ct=6812.408] SMELLING BLOOD.
[ct=6813.513] THE GAME IS OVER, BUT
[ct=6816.573] THEY’RE ROARING ON THE
[ct=6817.474] 4th AND 2.
[ct=6817.876] DANIELS FIRES, AND
[ct=6819.488] THAT WILL BE ENOUGH
[ct=6834.160] ZACK ERTZ AGAIN.
[ct=6835.875] >> Kirk: GETTING
[ct=6835.875] BEYOND THE FIRST DOWN
[ct=6840.052] MARKER.
[ct=6847.614] >> Al: NOAH BROWN.
[ct=6849.972] >> Kirk: AS YOU LOOK
[ct=6851.796] AT THIS FRANCHISE, THE
[ct=6852.044] NEXT NATURAL STEP FOR
[ct=6857.763] THEM IS PUT PIECES.
[ct=6859.434] I THINK THEY’RE STILL
[ct=6861.404] KIND OF SEARCHING AS
[ct=6861.750] THEY GROW TO BECOME
[ct=6864.230] DIFFERENCE MAKERS.
[ct=6866.057] >> Al: ON THE OUTSIDE
[ct=6867.924] McNICHOLS.
[ct=6872.287] YOU SAW KLIFF
[ct=6874.633] SIDELINE, HEY, LET’S
[ct=6875.903] GET INTO THE END ZONE,
[ct=6876.411] LET’S LEAVE WITH
[ct=6876.913] SOMETHING, WITH
[ct=6877.948] ANYTHING.
[ct=6883.232] DANIELS ESCAPES.
[ct=6883.896] THAT PASS I HAULED IN
[ct=6886.522] AT THE 6 YARD LINE.
[ct=6889.703] THAT’S ZACCHEAUS,
[ct=6891.193] MAKING IT THE 1st AND
[ct=6894.130] GOAL.
[ct=6894.920] WELL, 36 TOTAL POINTS.
[ct=6895.299] I’D LIKE TO TELL YOU
[ct=6896.975] SOMETHING’S IN PLAY
[ct=6898.514] HERE, BUT IT’S NOT.
[ct=6899.475] >> Kirk: I APPRECIATE
[ct=6904.408] AND THAT’S BROKEN UP
[ct=6907.570] AND INCOMPLETE.
[ct=6908.626] >> Kirk: GARDNER
[ct=6910.274] JOHNSON GOT A GREAT
[ct=6913.344] JUMP ON THAT, ALMOST
[ct=6913.776] CAME UP WITH AN
[ct=6914.720] INTERCEPTION.
[ct=6915.522] LIKE YOU SAID, THIS
[ct=6916.327] GAME IS OUT OF REACH,
[ct=6917.113] BUT BOTH SIDES ARE
[ct=6921.180] COMPETING.
[ct=6923.113] C.J. GARDNER-JOHNSON
[ct=6923.113] AGAIN READING THE
[ct=6924.576] ALMOST GETS IN FRONT.
[ct=6925.045] THAT’S A BATTLE TO
[ct=6927.018] FOUR HANDS -- TWO SETS
[ct=6928.057] OF HANDS FIGHTING FOR
[ct=6929.027] THAT FOOTBALL.
[ct=6929.333] >> Al: THESE TWO TEAMS
[ct=6931.226] WILL SEE EACH OTHER
[ct=6933.509] AGAIN BEFORE THE END
[ct=6933.861] OF THE SEASON IN
[ct=6936.192] LANDOVER.
[ct=6942.079] RESET THE PLAY CLOCK
[ct=6944.151] SAYS ADRIAN HILL.
[ct=6945.357] ON A 2nd DOWN AND
[ct=6946.806] SO WASHINGTON WILL GO
[ct=6948.568] TO 7-4, AND THE EAGLES
[ct=6950.781] ARE GOING TO GO TO
[ct=6951.449] AND THAT WILL BE
[ct=6952.036] CAUGHT FOR A
[ct=6957.890] SO ZACK ERTZ, WHO WILL
[ct=6960.438] ALWAYS BE WRITTEN INTO
[ct=6961.029] THE LORE OF THE EAGLE,
[ct=6961.945] THE BIG TOUCHDOWN IN
[ct=6965.171] THE SUPER BOWL AGAINST
[ct=6970.587] NEW ENGLAND.
[ct=6971.082] QUINN SAYS LET’S GO
[ct=6972.813] FOR A PAIR.
[ct=6974.920] >> Kirk: YOU GET AN
[ct=6975.508] ONSIDEKICK.
[ct=6978.742] YOU NEVER KNOW.
[ct=6980.421] >> Al: YOU’RE RIGHT.
[ct=6982.194] YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT
[ct=6983.527] JAYDEN DANIELS DID
[ct=6988.135] AGAINST CHICAGO.
[ct=6988.426] >> Kirk: STILL HAVE
[ct=6991.460] TWO TIMEOUTS
[ct=6992.283] >> Al: JUST SAYING.
[ct=6992.905] AND A TIMEOUT IS NOW
[ct=6997.131] CALLED BY SIRIANNI.
[ct=6998.105] YOU DON’T WANT TO GIVE
[ct=7001.728] THIS UP.
[ct=7001.980] MOVE AROUND AND DON’T
[ct=7004.673] RECOVER AN ON-SIDE
[ct=7006.525] KICK AND HAVE DANIELS
[ct=7008.619] DO HIS THING AGAIN.
[ct=7009.286] >> Kirk: LEAGUE WIDE
[ct=7010.879] THIS YEAR THE ON-SIDE
[ct=7013.205] KICK HAS WORKED TWICE,
[ct=7017.100] 2 OF 30.
[ct=7017.809] AGAIN, THERE’S ALWAYS
[ct=7022.655] A CAHANCE.
[ct=7023.171] GOT TO HIT THIS
[ct=7025.177] 2-POINTER FIRST.
[ct=7026.154] 7% CHANCE.
[ct=7031.689] >> Al: I’M SAYING 4.36
[ct=7033.863] EXPECTED, NEXT GEN.
[ct=7033.863] I’M THE LAST GEN.
[ct=7035.420] WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO
[ct=7036.042] SAY?
[ct=7038.271] HERE’S A 2 POINT RIGHT
[ct=7039.832] DANIELS ROLLING,
[ct=7042.167] TRYING TO GET RID OF
[ct=7044.314] IT, LOOKING DOWNFIELD.
[ct=7046.269] CAN SOMEBODY GET OPEN?
[ct=7047.970] NO, THAT OPEN BUT
[ct=7054.379] >> Kirk: NO, IT’S 0.00
[ct=7056.012] CHANCE.
[ct=7060.471] >> Al: 0.01 AGAINST
[ct=7061.063] EXPECTED.
[ct=7061.522] >> Kirk: NOBODY WAS
[ct=7062.583] ABLE TO WORK WITH THE
[ct=7067.041] GOOD EFFORT THERE BY
[ct=7067.305] ERTZ.
[ct=7067.792] THAT’S WORTH ANOTHER
[ct=7068.779] LOOK DOES HE HAVE
[ct=7069.822] POSSESSION OF THE
[ct=7074.197] >> Al: THERE’S COOPER
[ct=7074.514] DeJEAN.
[ct=7075.363] >> Kirk: HE DEFINITELY
[ct=7076.960] HAD THIS BALL.
[ct=7079.452] WANT TO SEE HIS FEET.
[ct=7079.452] >> Al: OKAY,
[ct=7082.270] >> Kirk: WOW.
[ct=7082.270] WOW.
[ct=7083.802] IF THAT RIGHT FOOT --
[ct=7085.773] THE LEFT FOOT’S DOWN.
[ct=7086.744] IS THAT RIGHT FOOT
[ct=7089.387] DOWN TO GET THAT BALL?
[ct=7092.238] >> Al: TERRY, WHAT
[ct=7093.896] YOU SEEING?
[ct=7094.926] >> YEAH, AL, IT LOOKS
[ct=7097.175] LIKE THAT RIGHT TOE
[ct=7098.009] JUST TOUCHES THE
[ct=7098.009] GROUND BEFORE
[ct=7101.339] I THINK THIS IS GOOD.
[ct=7102.705] >> Al: WELL, NOT YET.
[ct=7103.364] ADRIAN HILL JUST
[ct=7104.532] ANNOUNCING THIS IS
[ct=7106.895] UNDER REVIEW.
[ct=7106.895] >> Kirk: BEYOND THAT,
[ct=7107.970] LOOK AT THIS GUY.
[ct=7109.618] LOOK AT THE EFFORT.
[ct=7110.524] 34-YEAR-OLD GUY,
[ct=7114.194] FORMER EAGLE, GIVING
[ct=7115.767] YOU -- I DON’T EVEN
[ct=7116.791] THINK HE CAN SEE THE
[ct=7119.487] BALL WITH DeJEAN IN
[ct=7119.958] HIS WAY.
[ct=7120.720] NOT ONLY DOES HE SEE
[ct=7122.536] IT, HE CATCHES IT AND
[ct=7123.595] WITH HIS BODY FALLING,
[ct=7124.682] AT LEAST GAVE HIMSELF
[ct=7129.240] A SHOT HERE TO GET TO
[ct=7130.210] THE SPEED
[ct=7131.748] THE FEET DOWN.
[ct=7132.149] >> IT SHOULD
[ct=7134.728] >> Al: THAT’S GOING TO
[ct=7136.641] MAKE IT 26-18, ON-SIDE
[ct=7137.805] KICK TO GO.
[ct=7138.412] THAT’S WHEN YOU SAY
[ct=7139.857] DON’T TOUCH THAT DIAL.
[ct=7141.389] BUT STREAMING, WHAT DO
[ct=7147.368] YOU DO?
[ct=7152.180] >> Kirk: I DON’T KNOW.
[ct=7152.642] REALLY DON’T KNOW.
[ct=7153.506] >> Al: NOBODY KNOWS.
[ct=7156.384] NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING.
[ct=7158.239] SO ADRIAN HILL, LOOK
[ct=7160.386] AT THIS.
[ct=7162.624] IT’S GOING TO BE 26-18
[ct=7166.790] WITH AN ON-SIDE KICK.
[ct=7168.971] >> Kirk: YEAH, THAT’S
[ct=7169.962] A CATCH.
[ct=7172.622] GOT THE FEET DOWN.
[ct=7175.726] GOT AN 8-POINT BALL
[ct=7176.569] GAME HERE.
[ct=7177.596] REVIEW IT WAS
[ct=7177.925] DETERMINED THE
[ct=7180.635] RECEIVER HAD BOTH FEET
[ct=7182.831] INBOUNDS.
[ct=7183.250] IT IS A SUCCESSFUL
[ct=7189.002] 2-POINT DRIVE.
[ct=7197.162] >> Al: DON’T LOG OFF.
[ct=7197.509] THAT’S GOT TO BE THE
[ct=7197.916] CALL, RIGHT?
[ct=7201.935] GOOD CALL.
[ct=7204.612] WELL, I KNOW WE’RE
[ct=7206.044] BACK TO --
[ct=7207.445] >> Kirk: I THINK WE
[ct=7207.960] ARE BACK.
[ct=7209.943] HE’S GOING TO TRY TO
[ct=7210.927] ON-SIDE KICK IT,
[ct=7211.353] RECOVER IT.
[ct=7216.689] TIMEOUT CALLED.
[ct=7218.440] >> Referee: TIMEOUT
[ct=7219.711] PHILADELPHIA, THEIR
[ct=7222.156] IT’LL BE A 30-SECOND
[ct=7230.792] NOW, WHAT WOULD BE
[ct=7232.610] CRAZIER, A WIN AGAINST
[ct=7233.300] CHICAGO OR SOMETHING
[ct=7234.298] LOONY HAPPENING IN
[ct=7235.854] THIS GAME?
[ct=7237.340] I DON’T KNOW.
[ct=7238.069] >> Kirk: WELL, HOW
[ct=7238.639] ABOUT IF YOU RECOVER
[ct=7239.969] THE ON-SIDE KICK,
[ct=7241.242] THROW ANOTHER ONE OF
[ct=7242.000] THOSE COMMANDERS HAIL
[ct=7243.623] MARYS, HIT IT, AND
[ct=7244.573] THEN MISSED A
[ct=7246.420] 2-POINTER, CAN YOU
[ct=7249.671] IMAGINE THAT?
