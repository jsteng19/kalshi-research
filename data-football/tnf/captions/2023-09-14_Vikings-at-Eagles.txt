[ct=98.713] SCRAMBLES AWAY.
[ct=103.991] CAN ONLY GET BACK JUST ABOUT TO
[ct=103.991] THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=109.318] IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN.
[ct=111.987] THIRD DOWN, LET'S CALL IT FOUR.
[ct=114.611] KIRK: THE ROOKIE IS
[ct=115.914] STORY.
[ct=117.348] WE WILL KEEP OUR EYE ON HIM.
[ct=121.227] HE HAS A CHANCE TO HAVE A BIG
[ct=121.227] IMPACT.
[ct=123.870] UNDRAFTED.
[ct=125.228] WE SEE EACH WEEK THESE PLA
[ct=126.627] THAT PLAY WITH A CHIP ON THEIR
[ct=126.627] SHOULDER.
[ct=129.297] THE ROOKIE OUT OF CINCINNATI.
[ct=134.640] THERE IS THAT LOOK,
[ct=137.357] WASTE ALL THAT LAST WEEK FROM
[ct=138.595] THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR.
[ct=141.343] AL: UNDER PRESSURE.
[ct=142.754] CHASING.
[ct=146.600] TAKING DOWN THE -- CLOSING IN ON
[ct=149.224] THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=149.224] STAYING IN BOUNDS.
[ct=153.202] HUNTER CHASED HIM ALL THE WAY
[ct=154.503] AROUND AND OUT OF THE BACKFIELD
[ct=155.835] BUT HE PICKED UP THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=158.482] KIRK: LAST WEEK AGAINST TAMPA
[ct=161.237] THEY SHOWED THIS LOOK ON THIRD
[ct=162.497] DOWN.
[ct=163.948] THEY DROPPED OUT AND PLAYED
[ct=163.948] ZONE.
[ct=166.684] THEY PLAY ZONE BEHIND IT THIS
[ct=168.065] TIME BUT THEY ARE PLAYING WITH
[ct=172.065] HE IS ABLE TO GET AWAY AND FIGHT
[ct=173.337] WITH HIS ATHLETIC ABILITY TO GET
[ct=173.337] THAT FIRST DOWN.
[ct=177.343] HUNTER HAD A CHANCE TO BRING HIM
[ct=177.343] DOWN ON THAT THIRD DOWN PLAY.
[ct=190.719] AL: A TIMEOUT IS TAKEN HERE.
[ct=192.179] MEANWHILE, WHAT THEY DID IS THEY
[ct=196.118] TOOK ELLIS OFF THE FIELD.
[ct=202.762] JOSH COMES OFF THE FIELD.
[ct=205.388] THE OFFICIALS CAN STOP THE GAME
[ct=206.717] WHEN THEY SEE THAT SOMEONE NEEDS
[ct=206.717] TO BE REMOVED.
[ct=210.696] WORD IS COMING DOWN ABOUT THAT
[ct=210.696] FROM UPSTAIRS.
[ct=213.370] FROM THE 37 YARD LINE, FIRST
[ct=218.818] QUICK THROW.
[ct=224.171] THEY ONLY THROUGH TO HIM LAST
[ct=225.491] TIME.
[ct=229.446] A MUCH UTILIZED TIGHT END IN THE
[ct=229.446] PAST MAKES
[ct=230.804] COUPLE.
[ct=234.784] KIRK: NICK SIRIANNI AND THE RES
[ct=236.082] OF THE PHILADELPHIA COACHES SAID
[ct=238.777] ENOUGH NOISE IN PHILADELPHIA.
[ct=244.104] GOEDERT DID NOT CATCH A BALL NOR
[ct=245.400] DID SWIFT.
[ct=246.717] RIGHT AWAY THEY WANTED TO GET
[ct=246.717] HIM THE BALL.
[ct=250.733] THE FACT HE HAS THE ABILITY TO
[ct=253.368] PLAY IN LINE AND SPREAD OUT.
[ct=254.728] YOU SAW HIM PLAY OUT IN SPACE
[ct=256.008] BUT THAT WAS GREAT DEFENSE FROM
[ct=257.378] THE VIKINGS.
[ct=260.003] AL: SECOND DOWN AND 11.
[ct=263.992] PLAY-ACTION.
[ct=265.306] GOING DEEP!
[ct=273.387] MAKING THAT CATCH IS DEVONTA
[ct=274.698] SMITH!
[ct=278.662] JACKSON HAD TO ADJUST.
[ct=279.935] SMITH STILL MAKES A GRAB.
[ct=283.918] KIRK: WATCH MURPHY PASS SMITH
[ct=286.618] OFF TO JACKSON WHO JUST CAME IN
[ct=289.247] AND RIGHT AWAY PHILADELPHIA
[ct=290.498] DOWNFIELD.
[ct=293.228] YOU CAN SEE THE SPEED OF SMITH.
[ct=297.306] HE GOES RIGHT BY HIM.
[ct=299.845] HE IS IN FOR A COUPLE PLAYS AND
[ct=299.845] GREAT JOB BY BRI
[ct=301.203] TEST HIM.
[ct=302.582] AL: BROWN.
[ct=307.912] IN AMONGST A BUNCH OF TRAFFIC.
[ct=309.354] JACKSON MAKES THE CAT -- MAKES
[ct=310.568] THE STOP.
[ct=313.219] YOU PAY A PENALTY WHEN YOU MAKE
[ct=314.664] THE SUPER BOWL.
[ct=317.250] BOTH OF YOUR COORDINATORS ARE
[ct=317.250] GONE.
[ct=319.844] BRIAN JOHNSON TAKES OVER AS THEY
[ct=322.478] OFFENSIVE -- AS THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=326.501] COORDINATOR.
[ct=327.838] AND A CHANGE ON THE DEFENSIVE
[ct=331.785] SIDE FOR MINNESOTA, BRIAN FLOREZ
[ct=333.234] COMES IN AS DEFENSIVE
[ct=335.775] SECOND DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=339.794] SWIFT. DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=345.116] A GAIN OF ONE.
[ct=345.116] THIRD DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=349.162] HARRISON PHILLIPS, 97
[ct=350.381] MIDDLE, MAKES THE STOP.
[ct=354.385] KIRK: BRIAN JOHNSON.
[ct=357.039] HE AND JALEN HURTS TELLING US
[ct=358.331] EARLIER THIS WEEK THAT THEY ARE
[ct=358.331] TRYING TO FIND THEIR RHYTHM.
[ct=361.020] LAST WEEK WAS A TOUGH START ON
[ct=362.321] THE ROAD.
[ct=363.738] OFF THAT LEAD.
[ct=366.289] IT WAS HARD FOR THE
[ct=367.675] THAT ATTACKING STYLE THAT YOU
[ct=370.316] ARE USED TO SEEING.
[ct=371.628] ON THIS FIRST DRIVE YOU CAN SEE
[ct=371.628] THEY WANT TO GET THE
[ct=374.285] DOWNFIELD AND BE AGGRESSIVE.
[ct=380.934] AL: HURTS WILL KEEP IT.
[ct=383.690] HE CUTS TO THE INSIDE AND GETS
[ct=386.528] STYMIED AT THE NUMBER SIX YARD
[ct=386.684] LINE.
[ct=388.816] JUST LIKE LAST WEEK, DEEP
[ct=390.979] DOWNFIELD THEY SETTLE FOR A
[ct=391.582] FIELD GOAL AND JAKE ELLIOTT
[ct=394.558] KICKED FOUR OF THEM LAST SUNDAY.
[ct=398.362] KIRK: IN A GAME LIKE THIS WHERE
[ct=401.058] YOU ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND THE
[ct=402.757] IDENTITY, YOU SEE HURTS WITH HIS
[ct=402.926] ABILITY.
[ct=405.370] BUT TO THE CREDIT OF THE VIKINGS
[ct=406.500] THEY DID NOT LOSE THEIR EDGE.
[ct=410.320] AL: JAKE ELLIOTT MISSED THE
[ct=412.041] EXTRA POINT LAST WEEK BUT HE WAS
[ct=414.324] THE NFC SPECIAL TEAMS PLAYER OF
[ct=417.139] THE WEEK WITH FOUR FIELD GOALS.
[ct=419.644] FROM 24 OUT, DOWN THE MIDDLE.
[ct=424.955] SET UP BY THE LONG PASS TO DAVON
[ct=424.955] TASTE SMITH.
[ct=428.953] le anything!
[ct=434.212] YESTERDAY.
[ct=436.895] IT IS AN INTERESTING STORY.
[ct=440.540] JALEN HURTS GOES TO THE SIDELINE
[ct=442.782] AND HE BROUGHT IT UP IN OUR
[ct=443.108] MEETING YESTERDAY.
[ct=445.203] HE SAID WHEN BRIAN JOHNSON WAS
[ct=447.993] THE QUARTERBACK COACH I COULD
[ct=449.062] TALK TO HIM.
[ct=449.729] NOW WE SEE HIM BACK ON THE
[ct=451.810] SIDELINE TALKING TO JOHNSON
[ct=452.041] AGAIN.
[ct=455.809] AL: HERE COME THE VIKINGS.
[ct=458.284] KIRK COUSINS IN HIS SIXTH
[ct=458.284] SEASON.
[ct=462.274] KIRK: A VETERAN GUY GIVING THEM
[ct=464.222] CONFIDENCE TO COME OFF THE LOSS
[ct=464.537] AGAINST TAMPA BAY.
[ct=467.612] HE HAD THREE TURNOVERS EARLY IN
[ct=467.959] THAT GAME.
[ct=470.776] HE IS THE FIRST GUY TO TELL YOU
[ct=471.580] THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.
[ct=472.955] 35 YEARS OLD.
[ct=476.908] 12TH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE AND
[ct=478.225] NINTH YEAR AS A STARTER.
[ct=480.906] WE WILL SEE HOW THEY TRY TO
[ct=482.239] GUYS OUT.
[ct=486.190] AL: SIX WITH MINNESOTA AND
[ct=487.544] BEFORE THAT, SIX WITH
[ct=487.544] WASHINGTON.
[ct=490.193] THE POCKET IS CLEAN AND THE PAST
[ct=494.162] IS GOOD UP TO THE 40 1-YARD LINE
[ct=495.490] AND JUSTIN JEFFERSON COMING OFF
[ct=495.490] A PHENOMENAL SEASON.
[ct=500.888] THE NFL'S OFFENSIVE PLA
[ct=502.223] THE YEAR.
[ct=504.914] WRITE UP THAT MATCHUP -- RIGHT
[ct=504.914] OFF THE BAT IT IS THE
[ct=508.891] JEFFERSON-SLAY MATCHUP.
[ct=511.569] KIRK: A LOT OF TIMES IT IS
[ct=514.988] JEFFERSON'S ROUTES.
[ct=516.495] THE DEEP CROSSERS.
[ct=520.342] AND THE FIRST PLAY, PLAY ACTION,
[ct=520.342] THEY GIVE HIM ONE
[ct=521.587] WINS THE MATCHUP.
[ct=525.604] AL: HE HAD A FIRST HALF AGAINST
[ct=526.934] TAMPA LAST SUNDAY AND
[ct=528.508] ALMOST NOTHING IN THE SECOND
[ct=529.828] HALF.
[ct=533.817] SLAY IS RIGHT THERE TO TAKEN
[ct=535.122] DOWN AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=537.836] KEVIN O'CONNELL IS THE SECOND
[ct=541.827] YOUNGEST COACH IN THE NFL.
[ct=543.092] ONLY SEAN MCVAY IS A YOUNGER.
[ct=545.904] AND HE COMES OFF THE STAFF OF
[ct=545.904] SEAN MCVAY.
[ct=549.825] KIRK: HE WANTS TO GET BIGGER
[ct=551.153] WITH SOME OF HIS
[ct=552.511] GROUPINGS.
[ct=553.822] LAST YEAR THEY HAD A ONE TIGHT
[ct=556.483] END GROUP LOOKUP.
[ct=559.129] HE FEELS HE HAS MORE VERSATILITY
[ct=560.446] MADE.
[ct=564.451] AL: SECOND AND NINE.
[ct=568.418] THE PRESSURE BEGAN TO DEVELOP.
[ct=573.754] INTENDED FOR ALEXANDER MADSEN
[ct=575.036] ALEXANDER MATTISON.
[ct=579.019] THE OFFENSIVE LINE FOR MINNESOTA
[ct=580.415] IS A MAKESHIFT LINE.
[ct=583.197] KIRK: LOOK HOW QUICK YOU SEE
[ct=584.494] SWIFT GET OFF THE BALL.
[ct=587.169] SUCH A GAME CHANGER.
[ct=589.824] THINK ABOUT AN EDGE
[ct=592.480] WORKING AROUND THE TACKLES.
[ct=596.575] THAT BLITZ ALLOWS SWIFT TO
[ct=599.181] GO BACK INSIDE.
[ct=604.516] AL: GOD IS A TERRIFIC
[ct=608.488] AND -- THAT IS A TERRIFIC
[ct=611.133] DEFENSIVE LINE AND DEEP.
[ct=615.098] THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=619.171] THE PASS WAS INTENDED FOR
[ct=620.532] OSBORN, FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=624.505] KIRK: THE PROBLEM IS YOU LEAVE
[ct=627.172] JORDAN DAVIS ALL ALONE
[ct=628.505] ONE-ON-ONE AGAINST CLEVELAND.
[ct=631.120] HE IS BIG BUT REALLY QUICK
[ct=633.828] ESPECIALLY WHEN HE KNOWS IT IS A
[ct=633.828] PASSING DOWN.
[ct=636.492] THE BIG FELLA GETS THERE IN A
[ct=636.492] HURRY.
[ct=639.112] HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE THAT
[ct=643.082] THROW WITH 345 POUNDS COMING AT
[ct=644.428] YOU THAT FAST?
[ct=649.718] AL: BRIAN RIGHT -- HIS POND.
[ct=651.087] -- HIS PUNT.
[ct=653.771] DRIFTING.
[ct=656.390] LOSES THE BALL BUT THE
[ct=657.670] ARE RIGHT THERE TO RECOVER AT
[ct=659.055] THE 10 YARD LINE.
[ct=663.098] A FUMBLE.
[ct=663.098] PHILADELPHIA ABLE TO RECOVER AT
[ct=664.428] THE 10 WHICH IS WHERE THEY WILL
[ct=665.821] BEGIN AT THEIR SECOND DRIVE OF
[ct=667.079] THE NIGHT.
[ct=668.416] 3-0 EAGLESLET'S GO DOWNSTAIRS TO
[ct=675.036] KAYLEE: WE HAVE LEARNED VIKINGS
[ct=679.040] DEFENSIVE BACK JOSH METELLUS
[ct=681.671] QUESTIONABLE TO RETURN.
[ct=684.537] AL: HE JUST SIGNED A CONTRACT
[ct=686.990] EXTENSION AND STARTED AGAINST
[ct=686.990] TAMPA BAY.
[ct=695.197] MEANWHILE, THAT PUNT FUMBLE WAS.
[ct=695.197] RECOVERED BY KEELEY RINGO.
[ct=697.908] PHILADELPHIA MAINTAINS
[ct=697.908] POSSESSION.
[ct=700.518] THE PASS TO THE OUTSIDE IS
[ct=700.518] INCOMPLETE.
[ct=705.886] GOEDERT WAS ONLY TARGETED ONE
[ct=707.191] TIME LAST WEEK IN NEW ENGLAND.
[ct=711.135] KIRK: RIGHT AWAY TRYING TO GET
[ct=711.135] HIM INVOLVED.
[ct=716.501] BRIAN FLOREZ TELLING US THAT
[ct=723.095] METELLUS IS A CHESS PIECE
[ct=724.426] BECAUSE HE CAN DO SO MANY
[ct=724.426] THINGS.
[ct=727.106] THEY BROUGHT OVER BRIAN MURPHY
[ct=728.429] FROM ARIZONA BUT THEY ARE STILL
[ct=731.113] FINDING THAT TO BECOME A
[ct=731.113] STRENGTH.
[ct=733.751] IN THE MEANTIME, THE SAFETIES
[ct=735.032] HAVE TO STEP UP.
[ct=737.693] AL: THEY GO TO GOEDERT AGAIN.
[ct=740.396] THREE TIMES, TWO CATCHES.
[ct=743.034] THE DEFENSE IS PROBLEMATIC.
[ct=745.723] THE HAD TO MAKE CHANGES.
[ct=748.353] WORST DEFENSE IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=751.366] KIRK: THE LAST THREE YEARS HAVE
[ct=752.616] BEEN A TOUGH ASPECT OF THIS
[ct=754.005] FOOTBALL TEAM.
[ct=757.961] I THINK BRIAN FLOREZ BRINGS A
[ct=760.580] MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH
[ct=761.951] WITH HIS BACKGROUND IN NEW
[ct=761.951] ENGLAND.
[ct=766.007] YOU SAW THAT IN THE OPENER
[ct=767.231] AGAINST TAMPA BAY AND YOU WILL
[ct=768.578] SEE THAT TONIGHT.
[ct=771.227] AL: BOSTON SCOTT COMES INTO THE
[ct=771.227] BACKFIELD.
[ct=776.553] REFEREE: FALSE START, OFFENSE,
[ct=776.553] NUMBER 65.
[ct=781.905] FIVE YARD PENALTY, THIRD DOWN.
[ct=784.530] AL: THE FIRST PENALTY CALL OF
[ct=785.857] THE GAME HALFWAY THROUGH THE
[ct=787.172] FIRST QUARTER.
[ct=788.541] LANE JOHNSON, THE RIGHT TACKLE.
[ct=792.536] KIRK: BRIAN FLORES HAS A
[ct=795.120] BACKGROUND OF BEING INCREDIBLY
[ct=797.833] CREATIVE, TRIES TO GIVE YOU A
[ct=799.108] LOT OF DIFFERENT LOOKS.
[ct=804.713] HE WANTS TO CONFUSE THE
[ct=804.713] OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=807.348] WITHOUT HAVING THOSE GREAT
[ct=808.694] CORNERS, THEY WILL PLAY ZONE.
[ct=812.699] AL: BUNCH THREE RECEIVERS TO THE
[ct=814.032] RIGHT SIDE, HURTS LOOKS THAT
[ct=816.623] WAY, TAKES OFF.
[ct=820.617] HE TAKES A HARD HIT AT THE 14
[ct=820.617] YARD LINE FROM JORDAN HICKS.
[ct=822.032] IT IS FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=827.222] KIRK: HE IS ABLE TO -- HE HAS A
[ct=829.917] THREE MAN RUSH, IT IS THIRD AND
[ct=832.556] LONG, LET'S TAKE AWAY EVERYTHING
[ct=836.551] RUSHING THREE, LOOK AT ALL THOSE
[ct=837.898] DEFENDERS AND EVERYTHING IS
[ct=839.209] TAKEN AWAY.
[ct=843.205] AS ATHLETIC AS HURTS IS, YOU ARE
[ct=843.205] ABLE TO GIVE THAT UP.
[ct=845.869] A GOOD JOB BY MINNESOTA'S
[ct=847.197] DEFENSE.
[ct=851.158] AL: PUNTING FROM THE GOAL LINE.
[ct=856.493] POWELL COLLECTS AT THE 46 YARD
[ct=859.162] INTO EAGLES TERRITORY.
[ct=864.432] A GOOD RUNBACK BUT HE COUGHS THE
[ct=865.803] BALL UP AND THE PHILADELPHIA
[ct=867.086] EAGLES, WAY WITH THE BALL!
[ct=875.188] NICHOLAS MORROW COMES UP
[ct=876.540] THE RECOVERY.
[ct=879.191] KIRK: THAT LOOKED LIKE A HUGE
[ct=879.191] RETURN.
[ct=883.192] A GREAT EFFORT BY EVANS TO GET
[ct=883.192] THE BALL OUT.
[ct=885.883] HOW ABOUT THE HEADS UP PLAY BY
[ct=888.803] MORROW, HE JUMPS RIGHT ON TOP OF
[ct=891.504] IT TO GIVE THE EAGLES THE BALL
[ct=891.504] RIGHT BACK.
[ct=895.473] AL: MINNESOTA DONE IN BY
[ct=899.495] TURNOVERS LAST WEEK, GIVE IT
[ct=902.086] AWAY RIGHT HERE WITH 6:09 LEFT
[ct=903.443] IN THE QUARTER AND THE EAGLES
[ct=904.750] UP, 3-0.
[ct=907.446] KIRK: THEY WERE ABOUT TO START
[ct=911.503] THE DRIVE IN PLUS TERRITORY AT
[ct=912.693] THEY COUGH IT UP.
[ct=915.415] AL: SWIFT IS THE RUNNING BACK.
[ct=919.585] THEY GIVE IT TO HIM.
[ct=923.314] HE PLAYED WITH DETROIT LAST
[ct=923.314] YEAR.
[ct=926.017] TO THE 34 HE
[ct=928.641] HARRISON SMITH.
[ct=932.624] KIRK: WITH KENNY GAIN WEALTH OUT
[ct=935.332] OF THE LINEUP, SWIFT GETS HIS
[ct=935.332] OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=941.931] A LOCAL PRODUCT FROM A GREAT
[ct=941.931] HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAM.
[ct=945.936] AL: AGAIN, SWIFT.
[ct=952.582] THEY LET MILES SANDERS GO, HE
[ct=955.197] GAINED OVER 1000 YARDS AND HE IS
[ct=955.197] NOW WITH CAROLINA.
[ct=959.176] I PREFER WHAT MIKE TOMLIN
[ct=960.692] DISTRIBUTION OF LABOR.
[ct=962.005] KIRK: [LAUGHTER]
[ct=963.305] THEY STILL HAVE THAT.
[ct=967.229] THEY HAVE FOUR DIFFERENT GUYS
[ct=968.609] WHO CAN CARRY THE BALL, WITH
[ct=969.930] GAINWELL OUT, THEY ARE DOWN TO
[ct=969.930] THREE.
[ct=971.235] IT IS NICE.
[ct=973.941] AL: FROM THE 38 YARD LINE.
[ct=975.222] THEY CALL HIS NUMBER AGAIN.
[ct=980.525] SWIFT, A GAIN OF 13 AND A FIRST
[ct=983.182] TACKLED BY HARRISON SMITH.
[ct=985.850] KIRK: THIS PLAY IS DESIGNED TO
[ct=987.197] GO UP HERE BUT A GOOD JOB BY
[ct=991.221] MINNESOTA CLOGGING THAT AND HE
[ct=992.505] IS ABLE TO BOUNCE THIS.
[ct=993.855] LANE JOHNSON TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=996.556] MINNESOTA THINKS THE BALL
[ct=997.843] GOING INSIDE.
[ct=1000.529] A NICE JOB WITH THE VISION OF
[ct=1000.529] SMITH.
[ct=1003.118] HE REALLY CREATED THAT PLAY ON
[ct=1003.118] HIS OWN.
[ct=1007.145] AL: THE BALL RIGHT ON THE
[ct=1007.145] MIDFIELD STRIPE.
[ct=1012.412] FOUR CARRIES FOR 24 YARDS FOR
[ct=1012.412] THE FIRST YEAR EAGLE.
[ct=1020.618] HURTS TAKEN DOWN BY A BEVY OF
[ct=1020.618] WHITE SHIRTS.
[ct=1024.590] LED BY DANIELLE HUNTER.
[ct=1028.628] KIRK: THEY WERE NOT SURPRISED AT
[ct=1029.963] ALL, FIRST AND 10 PLAY ACTION.
[ct=1034.146] THE ROOKIE LINEBACKER, PACE,
[ct=1035.472] WALKED UP TO THE LINE OF
[ct=1036.775] SCRIMMAGE AND AFFECTED THE
[ct=1038.127] COMMUNICATION.
[ct=1040.811] HUNTER DID A GOOD JOB OF PUTTING
[ct=1042.165] PRESSURE OFF THE EDGE.
[ct=1042.165] A GROUP EFFORT.
[ct=1046.136] BRIAN FLORES DIALING IT UP.
[ct=1048.714] NOT FOOLED AT ALL AFTER A COUPLE
[ct=1050.075] NICE RUNS BY SWIFT.
[ct=1052.759] OFFGUARD.
[ct=1055.457] AL: SEVEN YARD SACK.
[ct=1059.382] BOSTON SCOTT IN THE BACKFIELD ON
[ct=1059.382] A SECOND AND 17.
[ct=1060.725] THEY SET UP A SCREEN.
[ct=1063.369] NOTHING HAPPENING.
[ct=1066.050] GOEDERT MAKES THE CATCH AND THE
[ct=1067.318] VIKINGS ARE ON TOP OF HIM.
[ct=1070.022] THIRD AND 16 UPCOMING.
[ct=1074.368] KIRK: IF YOU ARE A VIKINGS FAN,
[ct=1074.368] IT IS ONLY YOUR SECOND TIME TO
[ct=1075.760] SEE THIS DEFENSE THIS YEAR.
[ct=1083.711] IT IS SUCH A DIFFERENT UNIT WITH
[ct=1086.326] BRIAN FLORES AS THE DEFENSIVE
[ct=1089.048] IT WAS MORE OF A BEND BUT DON'T
[ct=1092.448] BREAK DEFENSE A YEAR AGO AND IT
[ct=1093.085] DID NOT WORK OUT.
[ct=1096.365] THEY WANTED TO SEE SOMETHING
[ct=1097.458] MORE AGGRESSIVE AND THEY BROUGHT
[ct=1099.116] IN FLORES.
[ct=1102.196] WE ARE GETTING AN IDEA OF WHAT
[ct=1102.834] THEY ARE CAPABLE OF DOING.
[ct=1104.625] AL: THIRD AND 16.
[ct=1107.691] HEY THANH OF TIME AND THEN IT IS
[ct=1109.419] PICKED OFF BY THE VIKINGS!
[ct=1111.846] THAT IS JACKSON.
[ct=1114.979] HE GETS UP AND RUNS IT BACK FOR
[ct=1117.210] A FEW YARDS, OUT TO THE 42 YARD
[ct=1120.783] JACKSON GOT BEAT BY THE LONG
[ct=1123.152] PASS TO SMITH, HE ATONES FOR
[ct=1123.380] THAT.
[ct=1127.264] 3-0 IN THE OPENING QUARTER IN
[ct=1130.404] T WEEK, THE
[ct=1134.113] MUG LINEBACKER LOOK, JOHNSON IN
[ct=1134.939] FOR METELLUS.
[ct=1136.843] SHOWING THE PRESSURE.
[ct=1142.711] REMEMBER, IT IS THIRD AND 15,
[ct=1144.083] THIRD AND FOREVER, AND THIS IS A
[ct=1144.083] MISTAKE BY JALEN HURTS.
[ct=1146.316] HE DID NOT EVEN SEE HIM.
[ct=1149.280] HE PREDETERMINED WHERE TO GO
[ct=1151.185] WITH THE FOOTBALL AND IT IS A
[ct=1151.913] NICE JOB OF SITTING AND READING
[ct=1154.118] THE EYES BY THEO JACKSON.
[ct=1158.137] THE FREE SAFETY BYNUM, IF THAT
[ct=1160.756] IS NOT PICKED UP BY JACKSON,
[ct=1161.000] BYNUM MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE.
[ct=1166.253] AL: HURTS WITH ONLY SIX
[ct=1166.721] INTERCEPTIONS ALL SEASON LONG
[ct=1167.171] LAST YEAR.
[ct=1172.110] TWO TICKS UNDER THREE MINUTES TO
[ct=1173.607] GO IN THE OPENING FRAME.
[ct=1176.363] ALEXANDER MATTISON IS THE
[ct=1176.614] RUNNING BACK.
[ct=1178.808] FROM THE 35 YARD LINE.
[ct=1183.820] AND MATTISON TAKES OVER FOR
[ct=1186.407] DELVING COOK AND THE BALL IS
[ct=1186.407] OUT!
[ct=1188.417] EAGLES THINK THEY HAVE IT.
[ct=1194.029] AND -- WE ARE WAITING FOR THE
[ct=1195.825] SIGNAL FROM THE OFFICIALS --AND
[ct=1196.405] IT IS PHILADELPHIA BALL!
[ct=1200.098] RIGHT OFF THE BAT, TWO
[ct=1200.330] TURNOVERS.
[ct=1203.723] JUSTIN EVANS COMES AWAY WITH IT.
[ct=1206.002] KIRK: IT LOOKED LIKE AVONTE
[ct=1208.241] MADDOX MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN HIS
[ct=1208.726] HAND IN THEIR.
[ct=1213.075] IT IS MADDOX WHO GOT HIS HAND ON
[ct=1213.368] THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=1216.581] EVERYONE WILL WANT TO SEE THIS,
[ct=1217.919] TAKE A GOOD, CLOSE LOOK.
[ct=1220.427] YES, THE BALL IS OUT.
[ct=1222.868] PHILADELPHIA GETS A SECOND
[ct=1223.212] TURNOVER.
[ct=1225.630] THREE LAST WEEK IN THE FIRST
[ct=1228.460] HALF AGAINST TAMPA, TWO ON THE
[ct=1229.832] ROAD AGAINST PHILADELPHIA.
[ct=1232.535] THEY ARE GIVING THE BALL RIGHT
[ct=1234.432] BACK TO THE EAGLES OFFENSE.
[ct=1237.024] AL: FIVE IN THE FIRST FIVE
[ct=1237.483] QUARTERS OF THE SEASON.
[ct=1238.724] A SHORT FIELD NOW.
[ct=1242.451] 11 TURNOVERS IN THE FIRST
[ct=1244.229] QUARTER OVER THE LAST TWO
[ct=1245.807] SEASONS, WORST IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=1247.714] 39 YARD LINE.
[ct=1250.618] PHILLY BEGINS THIS DRIVE.
[ct=1255.338] HURTS, NOWHERE TO GO.
[ct=1261.313] KIRK: WHEN YOU DEFEND THIS
[ct=1263.545] OFFENSE, YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE
[ct=1264.437] EDGES TO THE DEFENSE.
[ct=1266.651] THIS IS A GREAT PLAY.
[ct=1268.164] WATCH JORDAN HICKS.
[ct=1271.088] YOU CAN WORRY ABOUT THE TIGHT
[ct=1273.250] END IN THE FLAT.
[ct=1276.633] HE AND HARRISON SMITH,
[ct=1279.283] WELL-SCHOOLED IN A SHORT WEEK TO
[ct=1279.992] ANTICIPATE THE EXTRA HAT.
[ct=1281.858] QUARTERBACK RUN GAME.
[ct=1285.179] BOTH ARE IN POSITION TO FORCE
[ct=1285.179] HIM BACK INSIDE.
[ct=1289.170] AL: ONLY A THREE-MAN RUSH, EIGHT
[ct=1289.710] DROPBACK.
[ct=1293.936] AJAY BROWN IN THE TRADE OF THE
[ct=1297.474] HE HAD A SPECTACULAR SEASON.
[ct=1300.602] ABOUT AS GOOD AS IT GETS,
[ct=1305.799] BETWEEN BROWN AND JEFFERSON, TWO
[ct=1307.228] OF THE ELITE RECEIVERS IN THE
[ct=1307.541] LEAGUE.
[ct=1310.757] KIRK: THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO
[ct=1312.257] HIT THEIR SHOTS DOWN THE FIELD.
[ct=1315.004] WE ALREADY SAW DEVONTA SMITH.
[ct=1318.869] BACK TO ANOTHER THIRD DOWN FOR
[ct=1319.366] THIS PHILADELPHIA OFFENSE.
[ct=1321.890] AL: JEFFERSON ON THE OTHER SIDE.
[ct=1324.106] I AM JUST SAYING IN THIS GAME.
[ct=1326.784] YOU ARE RIGHT AS FAR AS THE
[ct=1327.928] TANDEM IS CONCERNED.
[ct=1330.520] THIRD AND 5.
[ct=1333.561] THE VIKINGS ARE RIGHT THERE
[ct=1337.150] JORDAN HICKS MAKES THE STOP.
[ct=1341.196] IT IS A RATHER INPATIENT CROWD.
[ct=1343.933] KIRK: OBVIOUSLY -- [LAUGHTER]
[ct=1348.494] NO MATTER WHAT THE SPORT IS,
[ct=1351.043] THIS TEAM WENT TO THE SUPER BOWL
[ct=1353.605] LAST SEASON, WE ARE IN WEEK 2
[ct=1354.327] AND THEY ARE ALREADY LETTING
[ct=1354.617] THEM KNOW.
[ct=1356.258] THEY ARE OFF NOW.
[ct=1357.606] THE EXECUTION IS OFF.
[ct=1360.237] THIS DEFENSE DESERVES A LOT OF
[ct=1360.445] CREDIT.
[ct=1362.781] GOOD TO SEE METELLUS BACK IN
[ct=1364.384] THERE.
[ct=1367.076] TRYING TO RUN A QUARTERBACK
[ct=1367.076] COUNTER.
[ct=1371.179] AL: 55-YARD ATTEMPT FOR ELLIOTT.
[ct=1376.882] THIS ONE IS OFF TO THE RIGHT AND
[ct=1378.228] NO GOOD.
[ct=1382.336] THEY CANNOT CASH IN AND THE
[ct=1384.943] CROWD SAYS, "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
[ct=1385.479] FOR ME LATELY?"
[ct=1391.819] 42THAT IS OUR GAME, GIANTS-49ERS
[ct=1394.163] KIRK: GREAT TO SEE BROCK PURDY
[ct=1395.492] BACK AND PLAYING WELL.
[ct=1398.118] YOU WOULD NOT EVEN KNOW HE
[ct=1398.410] SUFFERED THAT INJURY.
[ct=1400.405] AL: ELBOW INJURY.
[ct=1403.695] MEANWHILE, COUSINS IS LUCKY HE
[ct=1404.125] HANGS ONTO THAT.
[ct=1408.111] JOSH OLIVER COLLIDED WITH HIM,
[ct=1408.700] THE TIGHT END.
[ct=1413.294] MAN, OH, MAN, THEY ARE HAVING A
[ct=1414.063] ROUGH TIME GETTING STARTED.
[ct=1415.692] KIRK: THEY SURE ARE.
[ct=1418.885] THE INTERIOR GOT PUSHED RIGHT
[ct=1419.470] BACK INTO COUSINS.
[ct=1422.649] AL: SECOND AND 15.
[ct=1435.253] THEY MOVE HOCKENSON, THE TIGHT
[ct=1436.795] END, INTO THE SLOT.
[ct=1439.975] A FLAG IS THROWN, A FREE PLAY.
[ct=1444.382] GOING DEEP DOWNFIELD, NOTHING TO
[ct=1444.698] LOSE, IT IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=1447.861] THEY HAD SLAY THERE.
[ct=1450.880] FLETCHER COX WAS ALMOST INTO THE
[ct=1454.879] KIRK: WHY NOT THROW IT UP TO 18?
[ct=1456.247] FREE PLAY.
[ct=1462.216] AL: THIS WILL TAKE US TO THE END
[ct=1462.424] OF THE QUARTER.
[ct=1463.556] HERE IS CLAY MARTIN.
[ct=1468.355] REFEREE: OFFSIDE, DEFENSE,
[ct=1469.683] NUMBER 91.
[ct=1472.103] FIVE YARD PENALTY, REMAINS
[ct=1472.752] SECOND DOWN.
[ct=1475.639] THIS IS THE END OF THE FIRST
[ct=1475.639] QUARTER.
[ct=1477.952] AL: SECOND AND 12 WHEN WE COME
[ct=1480.222] HERBSTREIT,
[ct=1480.222] KAYLEE HARTUNG.
[ct=1483.491] WE START THE SECOND QUARTER
[ct=1485.572] AFTER A VERY STRANGE OPENING
[ct=1490.097] SECOND DOWN AND 12 AS COUSINS
[ct=1490.097] QUICKLY GETS TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=1494.514] TACKLED AT MIDFIELD BY ADDISON,
[ct=1494.794] THE ROOKIE.
[ct=1496.532] IT WILL BE THIRD AND 3.
[ct=1500.095] KIRK: THAT IS MORE OF WHAT WE
[ct=1501.293] EXPECTED TO SEE FROM THIS
[ct=1502.830] OFFENSE, BEING ABLE TO GET THE
[ct=1503.151] BALL OUT IN A HURRY.
[ct=1506.996] ONE OF THE CONCERNS YOU HAVE
[ct=1511.146] WITH THIS OFFENSIVE LINE, YOU
[ct=1512.750] HAVE A BACKUP LEFT TACKLE, A
[ct=1514.170] BACKUP CENTER AND A COUPLE
[ct=1517.321] GUARDS STILL TRYING TO FIND
[ct=1519.442] THEIR WAY AGAINST ARGUABLY ONE
[ct=1520.796] OF THE TOP DEFENSIVE LINES, IF
[ct=1522.128] NOT THE TOP, IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=1524.625] AL: PRESSURE ON ALMOST EVERY
[ct=1524.625] PLAY.
[ct=1528.388] THE LINE DOES A GOOD JOB HERE
[ct=1530.886] AND THE PASS IS CAUGHT, THIS
[ct=1530.892] TIME BY K.J. OSBORN.
[ct=1535.955] IT WAS SECOND AND 17 AND THEY
[ct=1537.187] TURNED IT INTO A FIRST DOWN,
[ct=1537.992] ONLY THE SECOND OF THE GAME.
[ct=1541.030] THEY COME UP NO-HUDDLE.
[ct=1547.655] KIRK: YOU ARE GOING TO SEE KEVIN
[ct=1548.351] O'CONNELL TRY TO MIX THINGS UP.
[ct=1552.339] ANYTHING HE CAN DO TO GET THE
[ct=1553.148] DEFENSIVE LINE ON THEIR HEELS
[ct=1553.472] AND CREATE TEMPO.
[ct=1555.992] AL: MATTISON, NOTHING.
[ct=1560.529] THAT IS JALEN CARTER, THEIR
[ct=1564.247] NUMBER 1 PICK OUT OF THE
[ct=1566.639] UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA, WHO MADE
[ct=1567.505] HIS PRESENCE FELT LAST WEEK AND
[ct=1567.750] AGAIN TONIGHT.
[ct=1571.347] KIRK: THE BACKUP CENTER IN FOR
[ct=1573.975] BRADBERRY SAYING, FIRST IT WAS
[ct=1575.702] JORDAN DAVIS OUT OF GEORGIA AND
[ct=1578.151] NOW I GET THE ROOKIE, JALEN
[ct=1578.151] CARTER?
[ct=1581.725] EVERYONE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT
[ct=1582.232] JALEN CARTER SINCE HE WAS
[ct=1586.704] SIGNED, INCREDIBLE CAMP, VERY
[ct=1586.704] HUMBLE ATTITUDE.
[ct=1589.398] FIT IN PERFECT IN THE DEFENSIVE
[ct=1589.822] LINE ROOM.
[ct=1593.033] AL: ROTATING HIM IN AND OUT.
[ct=1596.209] THE PASS CAUGHT FOR A SHORT
[ct=1596.478] GAIN.
[ct=1599.640] THAT IS T.J. HOCKENSON, CAME
[ct=1602.340] OVER FROM A TRADE WITH DETROIT
[ct=1606.464] KIRK: YOUR ONLY CHANCE IS YOU
[ct=1608.221] HAVE TO MOVE THE POCKET AND YOU
[ct=1608.885] HAVE TO GET THE BALL OUT FAST.
[ct=1612.414] KIRK COUSINS IS AS GOOD AS
[ct=1614.288] ANYONE BECAUSE OF HIS EXPERIENCE
[ct=1617.973] AND INCREDIBLE PREP TO BE ABLE
[ct=1618.640] TO DECIPHER DEFENSES AND MAKE
[ct=1620.218] QUICK DECISIONS.
[ct=1623.069] PHILLY'S ANSWER WILL BE TO
[ct=1624.926] TIGHTEN COVERAGES AND NOT GIVE
[ct=1625.443] AWAY EASY THROWS.
[ct=1628.456] AL: THIRD AND 9.
[ct=1630.599] C.J. HAM COMES INTO THE
[ct=1634.465] PASS OVER THE MIDDLE, CAUGHT,
[ct=1636.016] HOCKENSON, ON THE RUN.
[ct=1640.652] FIGHTS HIS WAY TO THE 17 YARD
[ct=1641.124] LINE, WHERE EVANS MAKES THE
[ct=1641.399] TACKLE.
[ct=1643.821] KIRK: GOOD JOB STACKING HIM.
[ct=1646.402] IT GAVE HIM SOME SPACE AND HE
[ct=1648.301] CAN WIN AGAINST A SAFETY.
[ct=1649.918] EVANS HAS TO PLAYOFF.
[ct=1653.002] TIGHT COVERAGE ON THE RECEIVER,
[ct=1653.185] OSBORNE.
[ct=1658.343] HE IS STACKED BEHIND HER
[ct=1658.343] RECEIVER.
[ct=1661.828] YOU CAN SEE KIRK COUSINS WITH
[ct=1664.615] THE ENTIRE OFF-SEASON TO WORK
[ct=1667.713] WITH HOCKENSON, A NICE THROW ON
[ct=1667.983] THIRD DOWN.
[ct=1669.817] AL: 24 YARD GAIN.
[ct=1679.239] MATTISON, HE HAS BACKED UP
[ct=1679.552] DELVING COOK.
[ct=1681.418] HE IS WITH THE JETS RIGHT NOW.
[ct=1683.282] MATTISON HAS BEEN THE BACKUP.
[ct=1687.296] HE WILL NOT BE DELVING COOK BUT
[ct=1687.763] HOW GOOD CAN HE BE?
[ct=1690.577] KIRK: HE IS A PHYSICAL BACK.
[ct=1695.350] I THINK HE RUNS TOUGH, HE RUNS
[ct=1695.631] PHYSICAL.
[ct=1700.476] TY CHANDLER IS BACKING HIM UP.
[ct=1705.609] IN THIS ERA OF NFL RUNNING BACKS
[ct=1706.795] TALKING ABOUT, WHY ARE WE NOT
[ct=1707.107] GETTING PAID.
[ct=1711.863] MINNESOTA IS AN EXAMPLE OF
[ct=1712.673] RELYING ON THE PASS GAME.
[ct=1717.061] AL: AVONTE MADDOX WAS COMING OUT
[ct=1717.665] AND HOLDING HIS SHOULDER.
[ct=1719.840] FIRST DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=1724.227] KIRK: YOU MOVE HIM AROUND, A LOT
[ct=1724.735] OF TIMES HE IS OUT WIDE.
[ct=1727.090] A GOOD JOB ON FIRST AND 10.
[ct=1729.223] USING HIM TO WORK ACROSS.
[ct=1730.825] GOOD ACTION.
[ct=1733.157] RAN THE FOOTBALL, COME RIGHT
[ct=1736.059] GOOD JOB BY COUSINS SELLING IT.
[ct=1738.098] AND THEN YOU SLIDE HIM OUT TO
[ct=1738.580] THE RIGHT.
[ct=1741.423] IT IS TOUGH FOR THE DEFENSE TO
[ct=1741.979] COME ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE
[ct=1743.674] FIELD AND MAKE THAT PLAY.
[ct=1749.253] THIS TIME, ONE OF THE MORE
[ct=1749.823] ELECTRIFYING RECEIVERS OUT IN
[ct=1750.075] SPACE.
[ct=1753.253] AL: THREE CATCHES FOR JJ, 23
[ct=1753.594] YARDS.
[ct=1757.840] THE FAKE TO MATTISON, THE PASS
[ct=1759.013] IS CAUGHT AND HOCKENSON BANGS
[ct=1761.843] HIS WAY INTO THE END ZONE ZONE
[ct=1762.476] FOR A TOUCHDOWN!
[ct=1767.169] THE VIKINGS, WHO HAD DONE
[ct=1768.275] ABSOLUTELY NOTHING UNTIL THAT
[ct=1771.529] DRIVE, HAVE THE BALL FOR FIVE
[ct=1773.710] MINUTES AND GO FROM THEIR OWN 45
[ct=1774.838] AND IN.
[ct=1778.804] KIRK: WATCH THE DEFENSE OF AND,
[ct=1780.949] DEREK BARNETT, WATCH THE BACKERS
[ct=1781.168] REACT.
[ct=1784.395] AS KEVIN O'CONNELL SAID, JUST BE
[ct=1784.732] EFFICIENT.
[ct=1787.190] WHEN YOU ARE EFFICIENT RUNNING
[ct=1790.168] THE FOOTBALL, YOU GET PLAYERS
[ct=1791.208] OUT OF POSITION ON FIRST AND 10.
[ct=1795.278] ANTICIPATING RUN, EASY FOR HIM
[ct=1796.366] TO GET THE BALL TO THE OUTSIDE
[ct=1797.718] AND TO HOCKENSON FOR THE
[ct=1798.276] TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=1802.841] AL: GREG, JUST BARELY BOOTS THAT
[ct=1803.474] ONE THROUGH.
[ct=1810.178] WITH 10:39 NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK
[ct=1813.975] TONIGHT'S FAST START, POWERED BY
[ct=1815.501] FAST TWITCH ENERGY DRINK.
[ct=1819.349] KIRK: THIS MINNESOTA DEFENSE IS
[ct=1822.003] SETTING THE EDGES, NOT GIVING UP
[ct=1823.502] THE BIG PLAY TO JALEN HURTS.
[ct=1825.798] THE DIFFERENT LOOKS BRIAN HURTS
[ct=1826.267] IS COMING UP WITH.
[ct=1832.834] THIS IS A MISS READ BY JALEN
[ct=1836.230] HURTS AND MINNESOTA ABLE TO
[ct=1836.472] CAPITALIZE ON THAT.
[ct=1840.324] AL:O'CONNELL, TEMPO, DIFFERENT
[ct=1843.609] PERSONNEL GROUPINGS, BOOTLEGS,
[ct=1845.792] DOING THEIR BEST TO SLOW DOWN
[ct=1846.270] THE PHILADELPHIA DEFENSE.
[ct=1849.221] AL: FROM THE 25 YARD LINE.
[ct=1853.443] BIG HOLE THROUGH THE MIDDLE,
[ct=1854.405] GAIN OF 8.
[ct=1857.777] D'ANDRE SWIFT SETS UP A SECOND
[ct=1857.964] AND 2.
[ct=1860.267] KAYLEE: I AM WATCHING QUEZ
[ct=1864.363] WATKINS BEHIND THE EAGLES BENCH.
[ct=1867.199] HE HAS BEEN WORKING OUT HIS
[ct=1868.381] RIGHT HAMSTRING.
[ct=1872.431] OTHERWISE, HE HAS BEEN
[ct=1873.630] STRETCHING AND HE DOES NOT LOOK
[ct=1876.129] LIKE HE WILL BE BACK IN THIS
[ct=1876.855] GAME ANYTIME SOON.
[ct=1879.767] WE JUST SAW CORNERBACK AVONTE
[ct=1883.009] MADDOX, THEY WERE LOOKING AT HIS
[ct=1883.715] LEFT SHOULDER.
[ct=1887.700] AL: SWIFT PICKS UP THE FIRST
[ct=1893.006] KIRK: GOOD TO SEE SWIFT GET HIS
[ct=1894.641] HANDS ON THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=1898.903] HE IS A BACK THAT HAS SO MUCH
[ct=1902.026] POTENTIAL IN HIS FOURTH YEAR,
[ct=1902.655] COMING OVER FROM DETROIT.
[ct=1909.206] REALLY KNOWN EARLY IN HIS CAREER
[ct=1909.756] THAT CAN BE A CHANGE OF PACE
[ct=1912.409] BACK, CATCH THE BALL OUT OF THE
[ct=1916.235] WATCHING HIM OUT OF GEORGIA, YOU
[ct=1918.102] KNEW HE HAD PLENTY OF ABILITY TO
[ct=1918.399] RUN THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=1920.946] AL: FROM THE 35.
[ct=1924.335] HURTS, CHECKS IT DOWN.
[ct=1927.307] CATCH MADE BY SWIFT.
[ct=1931.389] KIRK: I THINK IT IS WORTH
[ct=1931.692] TALKING RIGHT NOW ABOUT JALEN
[ct=1932.021] HURTS.
[ct=1934.877] HE TOLD US YESTERDAY IN OUR
[ct=1936.701] PRODUCTION MEETING, LAST YEAR IS
[ct=1936.974] OVER.
[ct=1939.898] WE ARE TRYING TO FIND A NEW
[ct=1940.193] IDENTITY.
[ct=1943.771] WE HAVE A NEW OFFENSIVE
[ct=1944.511] COORDINATOR, A LOT OF THE SAME
[ct=1947.014] BODIERS THAT WERE HERE LAST YEAR
[ct=1949.973] -- BODIES THAT WERE HERE LAST
[ct=1952.808] DOES NT FEEL A LITTLE BIT
[ct=1953.576] HESITANT?
[ct=1956.630] HE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE PLAYING
[ct=1958.713] IN THAT COMFORTABLE, CONFIDENT
[ct=1960.001] WAY HE WAS A YEAR AGO.
[ct=1965.080] AL: MEANWHILE, THE EAGLES GAINED
[ct=1967.373] 54 YARDS ON THAT LONG PASS TO
[ct=1968.630] DEVONTA SMITH.
[ct=1974.086] ON THE NEXT 22 PLAYS -- THE
[ct=1976.876] OTHER 22 PLAYS -- THEY GAIN A
[ct=1978.608] TOTAL OF 54 YARDS.
[ct=1980.139] KIRK: WOW.
[ct=1981.694] AL: THIRD AND 3.
[ct=1984.623] SWIFT PICKS UP THE FIRST.
[ct=1987.405] KIRK: IT FEELS LIKE THEY ARE
[ct=1988.248] GOING BACK TO THE RUNNING GAME
[ct=1988.535] RIGHT NOW.
[ct=1991.713] WHEN THEY GET SWIFT GOING --
[ct=1992.983] THERE IS SOME GOOD PUSH HERE.
[ct=1995.661] THEY ARE TRYING TO GET BEHIND
[ct=1997.043] THE BIG FELLAS.
[ct=2000.607] NICE JOB BY LANDON DICKERSON
[ct=2001.197] OPENING THAT UP.
[ct=2003.549] AN EASY FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2006.425] THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE
[ct=2008.011] OUT WHAT BRIAN FLORES IS
[ct=2008.339] THROWING AT THEM.
[ct=2012.035] THEY HAVE TO TAKE SOME SHOTS AND
[ct=2012.781] CREATE SOME ONE-ON-ONE CHANCES.
[ct=2015.481] YOU HAVE THE RECEIVERS TO GO
[ct=2017.894] AL: AGAIN, THEY CALLED HIS
[ct=2018.211] NUMBER.
[ct=2021.823] REMEMBER, SANDERS, THEY LET HIM
[ct=2022.234] GO TO CAROLINA.
[ct=2025.260] GAINWELL, THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT
[ct=2027.874] BE THE NUMBER 1 BACK, HE STARTED
[ct=2029.741] LAST WEEK BUT HAS A RIB INJURY.
[ct=2033.243] THEY BRING IN SWIFT, BRING IN
[ct=2035.657] RESHOT PENNY, WHO LOOK GOOD SO
[ct=2037.833] MANY TIMES BUT COULD NOT STAY
[ct=2038.109] HEALTHY.
[ct=2040.484] KIRK: AND THEY HAVE BOSTON
[ct=2040.802] SCOTT.
[ct=2042.541] IT IS A REVOLVING DOOR.
[ct=2046.429] AL: SECOND AND 7.
[ct=2051.012] THIS TIME THEY GIVE IT TO SCOTT.
[ct=2053.900] SCOTT PICKED UP A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2058.513] BOSTON SCOTT, HE HAS BEEN WITH
[ct=2058.904] THE TEAM FOR FIVE YEARS.
[ct=2060.861] PRACTICE SQUAD IN 2018.
[ct=2062.847] 5’
[ct=2064.429] 5'6", 203.
[ct=2067.273] KIRK: AL, I THINK YOU WOULD
[ct=2069.974] AGREE IN THIS FIRST HALF, THIS
[ct=2071.583] IS THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE SAID
[ct=2074.543] WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET CUTE, WE
[ct=2075.166] WILL GET BEHIND THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=2077.104] LINE AND CONTROL THE LINE OF
[ct=2078.988] SCRIMMAGE AND ROTATE OUR BACKS.
[ct=2080.805] AL: DO IT AGAIN.
[ct=2083.584] SCOTT, PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2087.549] KIRK: THAT IS ONE WAY TO COMBAT
[ct=2088.391] A TEAM THAT IS THROWING A LOT OF
[ct=2090.473] GIMMICKS AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT
[ct=2090.776] LOOKS.
[ct=2093.643] YOU SIMPLIFY THINGS UP FRONT,
[ct=2096.538] GET AHAT ON AHAT AND GET A NICE
[ct=2096.834] PUSH.
[ct=2099.798] THIS IS A VETERAN OFFENSIVE
[ct=2101.817] CAM JURGENS IS IN.
[ct=2104.518] THE ONLY CHANGE THEY HAD AT
[ct=2104.988] RIGHT GUARD.
[ct=2107.401] OTHER THAN THAT, GREAT
[ct=2110.726] A DRIVE LIKE THIS CAN OPEN UP
[ct=2111.186] YOUR WHOLE OFFENSE.
[ct=2113.126] AL: GOOD NEWS FOR THE VIKINGS,
[ct=2115.390] JOSH METELLUS IS BACK IN THE
[ct=2115.390] GAME.
[ct=2119.157] HURTS WILL TAKE IT HIMSELF,
[ct=2121.101] TURNS THE CORNER AND PICKS UP 8
[ct=2122.389] BEFORE HE SCRAMBLES OUT OF
[ct=2122.642] BOUNDS.
[ct=2126.073] THEY HAVE ALREADY RUN THE BALL
[ct=2126.467] 17 TIMES IN THE HALF.
[ct=2129.123] KIRK: WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THEM
[ct=2129.710] KEEPING THE EDGE.
[ct=2134.911] THIS TIME, THE CORNER, MURPHY,
[ct=2135.831] INSTEAD OF JUMPING INSIDE, HE
[ct=2137.583] TRIES TO USE HIS SPEED AGAINST
[ct=2137.819] GOEDERT.
[ct=2140.342] HE HAS TO GET TO THE SIDELINE,
[ct=2144.507] RACE JALEN HURTS TO THE BOUNDARY
[ct=2145.838] AND CANNOT LET HIM GET AROUND
[ct=2146.771] THE CORNER OR HE WILL PICK UP
[ct=2147.015] BIG YARDS.
[ct=2149.141] AL: SECOND AND A COUPLE.
[ct=2152.042] AGAIN, WHY NOT?
[ct=2153.813] BOSTON SCOTT.
[ct=2160.011] THAT IS SEVEN RUNS IN A ROW, 18
[ct=2160.350] IN THE HALF.
[ct=2163.259] KIRK: NICE JOB BY THE VETERAN
[ct=2163.760] JASON KELSEY.
[ct=2166.838] THEY BROUGHT A BLITZ FROM IVAN
[ct=2166.838] PACE.
[ct=2170.396] ONE BEARCAT TO ANOTHER, HE
[ct=2170.495] HANDLES THAT.
[ct=2173.013] NICE JOB OPENING UP THE RIGHT
[ct=2173.305] SIDE.
[ct=2175.416] SEVEN STRAIGHT RUNS.
[ct=2176.952] AL: YEAH.
[ct=2180.481] 10 PLAYS ON THIS DRIVE, NINE
[ct=2182.183] RUNS, ONE PASS.
[ct=2184.924] SWIFT BACK IN THERE.
[ct=2192.961] MOVING AROUND ON DEFENSE.
[ct=2198.842] HURTS, OFF HIS BACK FOOT, THROWS
[ct=2202.804] IT AROUND, INTENDED FOR A.J.
[ct=2203.049] BROWN.
[ct=2205.309] SECOND DOWN AND 10.
[ct=2208.450] KIRK: BRIAN HURTS TELLING US
[ct=2210.459] WHEN JALEN HURTS CHECKS, WE WILL
[ct=2210.828] CHECK.
[ct=2219.264] THAT TIME, THAT WAS A WIN FOR
[ct=2221.958] FLORES AND THE VIKINGS.
[ct=2222.763] NICE ADJUSTMENT.
[ct=2225.816] NOTHING HURTS COULD DO AFTER
[ct=2226.372] THAT CHECK.
[ct=2229.048] AL: PRESSURE THIS TIME.
[ct=2233.156] WIDE OPEN, A.J. BROWN.
[ct=2236.317] AND A FIRST DOWN TO THE 17 YARD
[ct=2241.114] TACKLE BY CAMRYN BYNUM.
[ct=2244.966] KIRK: MINNESOTA BRINGS PRESSURE
[ct=2245.880] BUT THEN THEY SINK.
[ct=2249.092] THEY DO NOT WANT TO GET ANYTHING
[ct=2250.953] UP OVER THE TOP FOR A TOUCHDOWN
[ct=2252.066] SO THEY ARE WILLING TO GIVE UP
[ct=2252.334] ROUTES UNDERNEATH.
[ct=2255.430] THE PROBLEM IS WHO YOU ARE
[ct=2256.229] ALLOWING TO CATCH THE BALL.
[ct=2259.049] A.J. BROWN KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH
[ct=2259.660] THE BALL IN HIS HANDS.
[ct=2261.090] THEY DROP IN COVERAGE.
[ct=2264.721] JALEN HURTS SAID JUST WANT TO
[ct=2266.912] GET THE BALL IN THE HANDS OF MY
[ct=2268.528] ATHLETES AND MAKE THEM HAVE TO
[ct=2268.780] TACKLE GUYS IN SPACE.
[ct=2271.070] AL: FROM THE 17 YARD LINE.
[ct=2280.320] YOU TALK ABOUT A.J. BROWN, YOU
[ct=2283.887] GO TO AN EAGLES PRACTICE, WHICH
[ct=2287.020] WE WERE AT YESTERDAY, HE DOES
[ct=2289.467] NOT HAVE A UNIFORM, YOU THINK
[ct=2289.942] THIS GUY IS AN EDGE RUSHER.
[ct=2292.280] WOW.
[ct=2293.673] YOU SEE HIM NEXT TO DEVONTA
[ct=2297.527] SMITH, HE IS THE OTHER EXTREME.
[ct=2303.232] AL: 6'1", 226 AND BROAD.
[ct=2305.153] TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=2307.922] A FIRST AND GOAL FOR D'ANDRE
[ct=2311.114] JORDAN HICKS MAKES THE TACKLE.
[ct=2314.543] 14 PLAYS ON THE DRIVE, 11 RUNS.
[ct=2318.857] KIRK: GREAT JOB HERE, AGAIN, IT
[ct=2319.093] IS THE VISION.
[ct=2322.185] THIS PLAY IS DESIGNED TO GO
[ct=2322.185] INSIDE.
[ct=2325.225] HE BOUNCES IT BACK OUTSIDE FOR
[ct=2328.754] THAT IS 11 CARRIES FOR 59 YARDS.
[ct=2332.235] QUITE A HOMECOMING SO FAR FOR
[ct=2332.573] D'ANDRE SWIFT.
[ct=2335.691] AL: SWIFT.
[ct=2336.901] CLOSE.
[ct=2339.701] STOPPED AT THE 1.
[ct=2342.811] YOU KNOW WHO IS LOVING THIS IF
[ct=2345.472] HE IS LOOKING DOWN FROM ABOVE?
[ct=2347.782] WOODY HAYES.
[ct=2349.179] KIRK: OLD SCHOOL.
[ct=2351.755] AL: THEY GO NO-HUDDLE.
[ct=2357.302] KIRK: HERE THEY GO WITH THE
[ct=2357.570] SNEAK.
[ct=2360.097] AL: ARE THEY GOING TO PUSH HIM
[ct=2360.097] IN?
[ct=2361.714] THEY DO THAT ALL THE TIME.
[ct=2365.049] THIS TIME A WHISTLE SOUNDS, NO
[ct=2369.652] CLAY MARTIN CHECKING.
[ct=2374.515] THEY CALLED A TIMEOUT.
[ct=2377.365] REFEREE: PRIOR TO THE BALL BEING
[ct=2380.430] SNAPPED, TIMEOUT, MINNESOTA.
[ct=2381.569] THEIR FIRST.
[ct=2384.977] 30-SECOND TIMEOUT.
[ct=2387.282] DOMINATE THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE
[ct=2387.676] AND THEY ARE ABOUT TO PUNCH IT
[ct=2387.881] IN.
[ct=2391.013] AL: YOU HAVE TAKEN ALMOST EIGHT
[ct=2391.429] MINUTES OFF THE CLOCK.
[ct=2394.884] SECOND AND GOAL.
[ct=2397.517] ARE THEY GOING TO PUSH HIM IN?
[ct=2400.024] THEY ARE LINED UP TO DO THAT.
[ct=2400.915] YEP.
[ct=2403.613] IN THERE, TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=2409.761] [LAUGHTER]
[ct=2414.405] THEY HAVE RUN THAT PLAY A FEW
[ct=2416.176] TIMES, HAVEN'T THEY?
[ct=2419.139] KIRK: YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO
[ct=2421.419] YOUR EARLIER DAYS ON MONDAY
[ct=2422.638] NIGHT FOOTBALL THE LAST TIME YOU
[ct=2423.352] SAW A DRIVE LIKE THAT.
[ct=2425.203] AL: FOR SURE.
[ct=2429.333] KIRK: LIKE YOU SAID, THAT IS NOT
[ct=2430.811] SOMETHING YOU SAY IN TODAY'S
[ct=2434.212] AT ALL ONCE THEY GET TO SHORT
[ct=2434.917] YARDAGE, SO OFTEN THEY GO TO THE
[ct=2436.608] SNEAK WITH THE PUSH FROM BEHIND.
[ct=2439.398] AL: THE COMPETITION COMMITTEE
[ct=2440.907] LOOKED AT THAT, IT IS AN UGLY
[ct=2444.334] PLAY, THEY THOUGHT ABOUT TAKING
[ct=2444.339] IT OUT.
[ct=2446.799] THEY WILL LOOK AT IT AGAIN NEXT
[ct=2451.904] IT IS UGLY -- UNLESS YOU ARE AN
[ct=2454.701] EAGLES FAN, THEN IT IS
[ct=2455.121] BEAUTIFUL.
[ct=2459.257] PHILADELPHIATHIS IS A GREAT NIGH
[ct=2460.020] FOOTBALL.
[ct=2462.830] KIRK: 67 DEGREES AND WE SAW A
[ct=2465.113] DRIVE WERE ALL THEY DID WAS RUN
[ct=2465.875] THE BALL DOWN THE FIELD.
[ct=2469.756] AL: 10-7, IN FAVOR OF THE HOME
[ct=2470.493] CLUB.
[ct=2474.533] KAYLEE: JALEN CARTER ENTERED
[ct=2476.256] THIS YEAR’
[ct=2477.940] THIS YEAR'S NFL COMBINE AS THE
[ct=2480.734] PROJECTED NUMBER 1 OVERALL PICK
[ct=2482.096] IN THE NEWS BROKE A MORANT WAS
[ct=2482.485] OUT FOR HIS ARREST.
[ct=2486.713] IN JANUARY, CARTER ALLEGEDLY
[ct=2488.392] DROVE IN A STREET RACE THAT LED
[ct=2489.518] TO ANOTHER CAR CRASHING THAT
[ct=2491.144] KILLED HIS TEAMMATE AND A
[ct=2491.804] GEORGIA STAFF MEMBER.
[ct=2496.227] CARTER PLEADED NO CONTEST TO
[ct=2496.492] STREET RACING AND RECKLESS
[ct=2496.492] DRIVING.
[ct=2499.752] HE RECEIVED 12 MONTHS PROBATION
[ct=2501.496] AND STILL HAS TWO PENDING
[ct=2504.359] LAWSUITS AND THAT HELP EXPLAIN
[ct=2504.781] WHY HE DROPPED TO THE NUMBER 9
[ct=2507.507] PICK AND ENDED UP HERE IN
[ct=2508.347] PHILLY.
[ct=2512.412] AL: THE CATCH IS MADE AND A 14
[ct=2514.365] YARD GAIN FOR JOSH OLIVER.
[ct=2518.339] HE CAME OVER FROM THE RAVENS AS
[ct=2518.339] A FREE AGENT.
[ct=2520.850] KIRK: WE CONTINUE TO SEE
[ct=2524.505] DIFFERENT FORMATIONS, BOOTLEGS,
[ct=2524.841] THE BALL OUT QUICKLY.
[ct=2527.554] REALLY NICE JOB BY KEVIN
[ct=2530.125] O'CONNELL, GETTING AWAY FROM THE
[ct=2530.743] DEFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=2534.415] WE JUST SAW JALEN CARTER.
[ct=2534.969] SO MANY TALENTED PLAYERS
[ct=2535.254] UPFRONT.
[ct=2538.018] AL: A HANDOFF HERE.
[ct=2542.541] MATTISON WILL FIGHT HIS WAY TO
[ct=2543.088] THE 42 YARD LINE.
[ct=2547.720] CLOCK TICKING DOWN TO THE 2-
[ct=2548.789] MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=2554.788] THE CLOCK WILL REACH THELIKE CAR
[ct=2557.139] THERE SHE IS, RIGHT IN THE
[ct=2557.402] MIDDLE.
[ct=2559.919] KIRK: WHERE WOULD THEY BE
[ct=2560.171] WITHOUT HER?
[ct=2563.602] AL: SECOND DOWN AND 6 AT THE
[ct=2565.148] 2-MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=2569.502] COUSINS THROWS AND IT IS CAUGHT
[ct=2569.902] A LITTLE SHORT OF A FIRST DOWN
[ct=2570.148] BY HOCKENSON.
[ct=2572.970] KIRK: HOCKENSON HAVING A NICE
[ct=2574.124] NIGHT TONIGHT.
[ct=2578.307] YOU HAVE SOME BACKUPS IN AT
[ct=2581.009] SAFETY AND LINEBACKER WITH THIS
[ct=2581.898] PHILADELPHIA DEFENSE.
[ct=2584.389] AL: THIRD AND 1.
[ct=2590.779] COUSINS, 10-12 FOR 88 YARDS.
[ct=2593.319] MOST EVERYTHING HAS BEEN PRETTY
[ct=2598.267] SHORT EXCEPT THAT 124-YARDER --
[ct=2601.686] EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE 24-YARDER TO
[ct=2602.363] HOCKENSON.
[ct=2605.190] THE PASTOR THE OUTSIDE IS
[ct=2605.474] CAUGHT.
[ct=2609.405] THAT IS JEFFERSON TO THE 50-YARD
[ct=2613.377] CLOCK TICKING DOWN TO ONE
[ct=2613.706] MINUTE.
[ct=2615.897] KIRK: IT IS FUN TO WATCH KIRK
[ct=2619.553] COUSINS, A VETERAN, ON BIG
[ct=2619.774] CALLS.
[ct=2623.943] YOU CAN SEE HIM MOVE JUSTIN
[ct=2624.409] JEFFERSON OUT BECAUSE OF THE
[ct=2624.664] SOFT COVERAGE.
[ct=2625.348] EASY THROW.
[ct=2628.889] AL: VIKINGS HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS.
[ct=2631.940] SLIDING TO HIS LEFT, THE PASS IS
[ct=2634.568] MATTISON COMING OUT OF THE
[ct=2638.127] COVERED BY BRANDON GRAHAM, IN
[ct=2639.947] HIS 14TH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=2642.976] KIRK: YOU HAVE BRANDON GRAHAM,
[ct=2644.717] FLETCHER COX AND A LOT OF YOUNG
[ct=2644.926] PLAYERS.
[ct=2647.994] NAKOBE DEAN WAS EXPECTED TO STEP
[ct=2651.106] IN, HE IS OUT WITH A FOOT INJURY
[ct=2652.845] SO NICHOLAS MORROW IS IN.
[ct=2657.911] A LOT OF INJURIES IN THE BACK
[ct=2658.623] END.
[ct=2663.047] MARIO GOODRICH IS IN FOR AVONTE
[ct=2663.368] MADDOX.
[ct=2666.054] THIS IS NOT THE SAME TEAM THAT
[ct=2667.599] PLAYED THE CHIEFS IN THE SUPER
[ct=2667.854] BOWL.
[ct=2670.674] AL: REED BLANKENSHIP IS IN.
[ct=2677.936] MEANWHILE, A TIMEOUT IS TAKEN
[ct=2678.122] WITH 52 SECONDS.
[ct=2680.838] RATE, MEANING THEY
[ct=2682.832] WERE ABLE TO STAY ON SCHEDULE
[ct=2683.360] AND KEEP THE OFFENSE GOING.
[ct=2686.056] AL: SO MINNESOTA DOWN TO ITS
[ct=2686.453] FINAL TIMEOUT.
[ct=2688.382] 52 SECONDS.
[ct=2694.410] WIDE, WIDE OPEN AND TURNING IT
[ct=2696.273] INTO A NICE GAME IS K.J. OSBORN.
[ct=2699.850] SOME ATTENTION BEING PAID TO
[ct=2702.746] JEFFERSON AND MATTISON, THEY
[ct=2703.262] FORGET ABOUT THIS GUY.
[ct=2706.482] KIRK: GOODRICH IS IN FOR AVONTE
[ct=2709.679] MADDOX AND HE IS CONCERNED ABOUT
[ct=2710.723] THE POTENTIAL PASS TO THE
[ct=2714.156] THE REST OF THE EAGLES DEFENSE
[ct=2714.414] IS PLAYING MAN.
[ct=2718.285] OSBORN GOES TO THE OUTSIDE AND
[ct=2719.036] THAT IS A GREAT READ BY COUSINS.
[ct=2723.962] EASY READ, THROW INTO THE FLAT
[ct=2724.486] AND GET INTO FIELD GOAL RANGE.
[ct=2727.422] AL: JEFFERSON, TOP OF THE
[ct=2728.098] SCREEN.
[ct=2731.282] SLAY ON HIM.
[ct=2736.675] COUSINS GOING DEEP, LEFT SIDE
[ct=2739.981] AND THAT IS INCOMPLETE, INTENDED
[ct=2740.523] FOR JORDAN ADDISON, THEIR NUMBER
[ct=2742.328] 1 DRAFT PICK.
[ct=2746.386] HE STARTED HIS CAREER AT PITT
[ct=2748.443] AND ENDED UP AT USC.
[ct=2751.252] KIRK: SEAN DESAI TELLING US MY
[ct=2756.685] TWO ALPHA LEADERS ARE REED
[ct=2757.485] BLANKENSHIP AND NAKOBE DEAN.
[ct=2759.003] NEITHER ONE OF THEM ARE OUT
[ct=2759.229] HERE.
[ct=2762.456] I CAN RELY ON AVONTE MADDOX BUT
[ct=2762.697] NOW HE IS DONE.
[ct=2764.480] THOSE ARE ALL STARTERS.
[ct=2766.714] YOU ARE GOING UP AGAINST AN
[ct=2769.226] OFFENSE THAT CAN BE COMPLEX WITH
[ct=2770.913] DIFFERENT LOOKS AND IT AFFECTS
[ct=2776.590] AL: COUSINS, DEEP AND IT IS
[ct=2777.282] HAULED IN AND THE BALL COMES
[ct=2777.403] OUT.
[ct=2783.607] HE IS OUT OF BOUNDS -- THEY DROP
[ct=2788.166] IT, THE BEANBAG, AT THE
[ct=2788.444] HALF-YARD LINE.
[ct=2791.045] TWO OFFICIALS CONFERRING ONE
[ct=2791.269] MORE TIME.
[ct=2794.328] KIRK: I WONDER IF THAT COULD
[ct=2794.856] POTENTIALLY BE A TOUCHBACK.
[ct=2798.175] REACHING FOR THE PYLON, THAT
[ct=2798.306] BALL CAME OUT.
[ct=2801.355] DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY
[ct=2801.829] DETERMINE THE BALL IS.
[ct=2804.128] THAT COULD EASILY BE A
[ct=2804.707] TOUCHBACK.
[ct=2808.983] REFEREE: THE RULING IS IT WAS A
[ct=2811.363] CATCH FOLLOWED BY A FUMBLE
[ct=2812.116] OUTSIDE OF THE GOAL LINE.
[ct=2814.212] THE BALL WILL BE PLACED IN THAT
[ct=2814.505] SPOT.
[ct=2817.104] AL: WHAT ARE YOU SEEING HERE?
[ct=2822.767] TERRY: IT APPEARS TO ME THE BALL
[ct=2824.875] GOES OVER THE PYLON, WHICH WOULD
[ct=2825.712] PUT IT OUT OF BOUNDS IN THE END
[ct=2829.745] IT MIGHT NOT BE DEFINITIVE.
[ct=2830.269] WE WILL GET SOME MORE LOOKS.
[ct=2832.630] THEY SAY IT WENT OUTSIDE THE
[ct=2834.813] PYLON, I DO NOT SEE THAT.
[ct=2837.259] I THINK IT IS OVER THE PYLON
[ct=2839.033] WHICH SHOULD MAKE THIS A
[ct=2843.399] REFEREE: THE PREVIOUS PLAY IS
[ct=2843.862] UNDER FURTHER REVIEW.
[ct=2846.986] AL: I THINK THIS MIGHT COME BACK
[ct=2850.707] BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU SAID.
[ct=2851.065] YOU CAN SEE PRETTY CLEARLY THAT
[ct=2851.838] THE BALL IS OVER THE GOAL LINE.
[ct=2853.421] IT JUST HAS TO GET TO THE GOAL
[ct=2862.853] >> AFTER REVIEW, THE FUMBLE WENT
[ct=2863.433] OVER THE PYLON.
[ct=2875.283] AL: INTERESTING POINT HERE.
[ct=2877.307] YOU HAVE TO HAVE POSSESSION OF
[ct=2878.503] THE BALL AS IT CROSSES OVER THE
[ct=2879.139] GOAL LINE.
[ct=2882.612] KIRK: FOR IT TO BE A TOUCHDOWN,
[ct=2885.228] CERTAINLY, BUT HE CLEARLY LOSES
[ct=2888.126] CONTROL BEFORE THE GOAL LINE.
[ct=2888.799] IT DOES INDEED GO OVER THE PYLON
[ct=2889.517] AS WE HEARD THE REFEREE
[ct=2891.000] ANNOUNCED.
[ct=2891.329] FOR A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=2895.010] AL: WHETHER HE HAS IT IN THE
[ct=2896.101] GRASS OR NOT, DOESN'T MATTER.
[ct=2899.231] KIRK: YES.
[ct=2899.231] IF HE’
[ct=2901.816] IF HE'S LOST CONTROL, IT’S A
[ct=2904.703] TOUCHDOWN --
[ct=2912.623] AL: SO IT’
[ct=2915.957] AL: SO IT'S -- PLAY CLOCK AT 25
[ct=2917.133] AND GAME CLOCK AT 34.
[ct=2919.695] THE EAGLES TAKE OVER AT THEIR
[ct=2919.996] OWN 20 YARD LINE.
[ct=2922.673] KIRK: THINK ABOUT THE TURNOVERS
[ct=2924.310] IN THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=2926.846] THIRD ONE NOW.
[ct=2930.590] TWO OF THEM DEEP IN PHILADELPHIA
[ct=2930.621] TERRITORY.
[ct=2934.003] AL: THE EAGLES LOOK CONTENT TO
[ct=2934.515] GO IN THE LOCKER ROOM.
[ct=2937.605] UP 10-7.
[ct=2942.821] KIRK: THEY JUST TOOK A TIMEOUT.
[ct=2950.646] SECOND DOWN AND 3.
[ct=2957.596] WE WILL SEE.
[ct=2960.300] JUST KILLING THEM ON THE GROUND.
[ct=2966.812] SO I GAME OF -- GAIN OF 18
[ct=2970.013] 21 SECONDS TRYING TO GET INTO
[ct=2973.475] FIELD GOAL RANGE. WITH 21 SECOND
[ct=2976.098] KIRK: I'M WITH YOU.
[ct=2977.646] I THINK THEY WERE CONTENT TO
[ct=2980.246] KILL THE CLOCK AND POP OFF BIG
[ct=2981.851] RUNS AND NOW THEY ARE THINKING
[ct=2982.292] FIELD GOAL.
[ct=2984.340] AL: RIGHT.
[ct=2987.790] THE 20, 25 YARD GAIN.
[ct=2989.232] AND YOU ARE IN BUSINESS
[ct=2989.880] ESPECIALLY WITH ELLIOTT.
[ct=2992.790] HE’
[ct=2993.534] HE'S OUT OF BOUNDS WITH 12
[ct=2993.534] SECONDS.
[ct=3000.776] THAT'S 125 GROUND YARDS FOR
[ct=3001.703] PHILADELPHIA IN THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=3004.359] KIRK: AVERAGING FIVE YARDS A
[ct=3004.609] CARRY.
[ct=3005.821] THEY CAN'T GET THE PASSING GAME
[ct=3006.024] GOING.
[ct=3008.094] CAN’
[ct=3009.831] CAN'T GET THE RHYTHM DESPITE
[ct=3010.367] HAVING JALEN HURTS AND THESE
[ct=3010.569] RECEIVERS.
[ct=3013.140] DEFINITELY CONTROLLING THE LINE
[ct=3014.537] OF SCRIMMAGE THE LAST TWO
[ct=3014.873] SERIES.
[ct=3017.746] THAT PLAY TOOK A LOT OF TIME OFF
[ct=3017.998] THE CLOCK.
[ct=3028.437] AL: SECOND AND SIX.
[ct=3034.450] RUSHED THREE, DROPPED EIGHT.
[ct=3036.794] OUT OF BOUNDS, SEVEN SECONDS.
[ct=3044.725] KIRK: JUST NOTHING DOWNFIELD,
[ct=3045.385] ESPECIALLY ON THE EDGES.
[ct=3049.770] BRIAN FLOREZ DROPPING, WILLING
[ct=3051.982] TO CONCEDE ON THE SHORT,
[ct=3052.346] UNDERNEATH THROWS.
[ct=3056.368] KEEPING THE EYES ON THE THREAT,
[ct=3058.094] THE QUARTERBACK TAKING OFF AND
[ct=3058.709] RUNNING.
[ct=3066.271] AL: CAN YOU RUN A 12 OR 13 YARD
[ct=3067.203] OUT IN SEVEN SECONDS AND SET UP
[ct=3069.677] A 60 YARD FIELD GOAL?
[ct=3074.623] HE GOES EMPTY -- FORGET ABOUT
[ct=3074.623] IT.
[ct=3077.788] JUST GOING TO PAD THE STATS FOR
[ct=3078.200] THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=3081.614] THEY WIND UP WITH 133 RUSHING
[ct=3084.533] AND THEY TAKE ANOTHER TIMEOUT.
[ct=3091.439] NOW THEY BRING ELLIOTT IN FOR A
[ct=3091.439] LONG FIELD GOAL.
[ct=3098.624] YOU ARE LOOKING AT 61 YARDS.
[ct=3100.570] THEY WILL MARK IT AT HIS OWN 41
[ct=3100.570] YARD LINE.
[ct=3102.577] HE CAN DO IT.
[ct=3106.129] KIRK: WATCHING HIM IN PREGAME,
[ct=3106.927] HE DEFINITELY HAS THE LEG.
[ct=3110.674] AL: CAREER LONG 61 YARDER
[ct=3114.705] AGAINST THE GIANTS, WHEN HE WAS
[ct=3114.935] A ROOKIE IN 2017.
[ct=3123.526] THE NEXGEN STATS TELL US HE'S
[ct=3124.895] GOT ABOUT A ONE IN SEVEN CHANCE
[ct=3127.727] OF MAKING THIS AT 16%.
[ct=3131.023] THAT’
[ct=3132.679] THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE NEXGEN
[ct=3135.559] STATS POWERED BY AWS.
[ct=3150.897] KIRK: DID YOU SEE WHAT JEFFERSON
[ct=3153.161] DID, THE FIRST THING HE DID, PAT
[ct=3155.180] HIMSELF ON THE CHEST AND SAY
[ct=3157.038] THAT'S ON ME?
[ct=3158.168] IT TELLS YOU A LOT ABOUT THE
[ct=3158.716] MATURITY.
[ct=3161.746] INSTEAD OF ARGUING OR DEBATING
[ct=3163.439] THINGS, HE JUST SAID, I WILL OWN
[ct=3163.702] THAT ONE.
[ct=3165.412] FRUSTRATED WITH HIMSELF.
[ct=3167.879] AL: YOU CAN HAVE THE PRESENCE OF
[ct=3171.317] MIND, BUT ON A PLAY LIKE THAT,
[ct=3172.116] HOW CAN YOU BLAME HIM?
[ct=3175.840] 61 YARDER ON ITS WAY, AND IT IS
[ct=3175.840] GOOD!
[ct=3176.549] HE DID IT.
[ct=3187.817] ELLIOTT, A COUPLE OF FIELD
[ct=3188.031] GOALS.
[ct=3192.993] THEY RUN, RUN, RUN, SET UP THE
[ct=3193.676] 61 YARDER AND SET UP A SIX POINT
[ct=3193.979] LEAD.
[ct=3196.341] KIRK: THAT IS YOUR DRIVER RIGHT
[ct=3198.184] LOW M INTO THE WIND.
[ct=3200.694] THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO RELY ON OLD
[ct=3203.541] RELIABLE, JASON KELCE AND THE
[ct=3205.045] ROTATION OF BACKS TO BE PHYSICAL
[ct=3206.253] AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=3209.392] THAT'S BEEN THE ADJUSTMENT AS
[ct=3209.666] WELL.
[ct=3214.633] AL: ELLIOTT TO KICK OFF.
[ct=3217.910] THE 61 YARDER AT THE END OF THE
[ct=3219.990] THIS DRIVE WILL START AT 25.
[ct=3224.464] KAYLEE: BOTH COACHES ACKNOWLEDGE
[ct=3225.698] THEY TRADED ADJUSTMENTS IN THE
[ct=3226.044] FIRST HALF.
[ct=3227.158] FIRST IT WAS THE VIKINGS DEFENSE
[ct=3230.665] AND IN THE END, THE PHILADELPHIA
[ct=3230.929] EAGLES OFFENSE FIGURED OUT HOW
[ct=3233.273] TO RUN THE BALL DOWN THE FIELD.
[ct=3235.282] NICK SIRIANNI SAID OUR GUYS WORK
[ct=3242.404] THEIR BUTTS OFF, BUT DID
[ct=3244.039] ACKNOWLEDGE THE VIKINGS GET
[ct=3244.554] THEMSELVES IN DIFFICULT
[ct=3244.785] SITUATIONS.
[ct=3248.332] HE SAID MINNESOTA CONTROLLED ALL
[ct=3250.643] OF THOSE MOMENTS, THE
[ct=3251.274] SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS.
[ct=3253.494] HE SAID, WE'VE GOT TO CLEAN IT
[ct=3253.494] UP.
[ct=3256.672] NOW HE WANTS HIS DEFENSE TO
[ct=3256.920] CREATE AND GET THE BALL
[ct=3257.302] THEMSELVES.
[ct=3261.391] AL: REPLAY OF THE FIRST HALF
[ct=3261.875] LAST WEEK THAT BEGAN ON THE
[ct=3263.263] GROUND.
[ct=3265.330] NOTHING DOING HERE FOR ALEXANDER
[ct=3267.394] MATTISON AFTER A GAIN OF A YARD.
[ct=3271.801] KIRK: SOMETIMES, IT'S THE OVER
[ct=3273.921] LOOKED AT ASPECT OF THE GAME.
[ct=3277.001] IF YOU ARE AN EAGLES FAN THE
[ct=3277.001] FIRST COUPLE WEEKS, YOU HAVE TO
[ct=3278.732] BE PRETTY HAPPY.
[ct=3282.351] GREAT PUNTING.
[ct=3283.812] WEEK TWO, WE'VE SEEN THE FUMBLE
[ct=3285.546] ON THE PUNT.
[ct=3290.140] AL: COUSINS LOSES THE BALL!
[ct=3290.475] IT IS PICKED UP.
[ct=3299.613] AND DOWN TO THE 7-YARD LINE GO
[ct=3299.943] THE EAGLES.
[ct=3305.687] KIRK: CHRISTIAN DARRISAW TRYING
[ct=3308.210] HIS BEST TO FIGHT THROUGH THE
[ct=3309.334] ENTRY ON THE LEFT SIDE, GOING
[ct=3312.221] AGAINST JOSH SWEAT WHO HAS A LOT
[ct=3313.296] OF SPEED OFF THE EDGE.
[ct=3320.189] NOT ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE
[ct=3322.130] GOOD HANDS.
[ct=3325.273] CLOSED FAST WITH THE CLUB OVER
[ct=3327.127] THE SHOULDER TO KNOCK THE BALL
[ct=3327.939] LOOSE.
[ct=3333.578] AL: IT WAS JOSH SWEAT.
[ct=3334.882] THEY ARE SO DEEP AND SO GOOD
[ct=3336.519] ALONG THE DEFENSIVE FRONT.
[ct=3341.304] FOUR TURNOVERS.
[ct=3343.173] SEVEN ON THE SEASON.
[ct=3343.631] FIRST AND GOAL FOR PHILADELPHIA.
[ct=3348.045] ON THE GROUND.
[ct=3349.674] THAT DID NOT TAKE LONG.
[ct=3351.631] ONLY TO THE HALF YARD LINE.
[ct=3362.817] KIRK: DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE
[ct=3363.587] TITANS.
[ct=3365.604] THAT WAS CLOSE.
[ct=3376.354] AL: HERE WE GO, THE PUSH, THE
[ct=3379.754] JALEN HURTS TAKES IT IN.
[ct=3382.208] THAT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO
[ct=3382.623] STOP.
[ct=3385.917] KIRK: YOU KNOW IT'S COMING.
[ct=3389.312] I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS
[ct=3392.949] SQUATTING THESE DAYS, BUT HE HAS
[ct=3395.783] AS STRONG A LEGS AS ANYONE.
[ct=3401.854] IT'S NOT LIKE THEY NEED SWIFT TO
[ct=3405.249] PUSH JALEN HURTS FROM BEHIND.
[ct=3406.432] THAT OFFENSIVE LINE IS HAVING A
[ct=3406.821] NIGHT.
[ct=3413.878] AL: THE TURNOVER, COSTLY.
[ct=3417.797] ELLIOTT FOR THE EXTRA POINT.
[ct=3421.034] AND EAGLES GO ON TOP BY A SCORE
[ct=3423.641] OF 20-7.
[ct=3428.774] 1:07 INTO THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=3437.254] THE VIKINGS HAVE THE CHARGERS AT
[ct=3437.254] HOME NEXT WEEK.
[ct=3440.926] PHILADELPHIA GOES DOWN TO TAMPA
[ct=3441.456] BAY.
[ct=3444.662] THAT SCOOTS THROUGH THE END
[ct=3448.963] KIRK: WE WERE HOPING TO SEE
[ct=3449.724] JUSTIN JEFFERSON AGAINST DARIUS
[ct=3452.343] SLAY.
[ct=3453.574] ABLE TO GET GREAT SEPARATION.
[ct=3457.257] A CHANCE TO PICK UP THE FIR
[ct=3458.150] WE SEE THE ADJUSTMENT HERE.
[ct=3461.410] SLEIGH SO LOCKED IN.
[ct=3463.974] DOES A GREAT JOB OF PREPPING AND
[ct=3465.524] SUCH A SMART GAME.
[ct=3467.997] I HAVE A FEELING NOW THAT
[ct=3469.679] MINNESOTA IS DOWN 13, YOU WILL
[ct=3471.862] SEE MORE OF THE MATTER THAN
[ct=3472.908] WE'VE SEEN UP TO THIS POINT.
[ct=3476.416] AL: YOU CAN ONLY HOPE.
[ct=3478.655] TOP OF THE SCREEN, PLAY ACTION,
[ct=3479.113] PRESSURE ON.
[ct=3482.528] READ PERFECTLY.
[ct=3486.961] ZACH CUNNINGHAM, SIGNED AS A
[ct=3488.171] FREE AGENT LAST YEAR IN
[ct=3488.694] TENNESSEE AND BEFORE THAT WITH
[ct=3488.917] HOUSTON.
[ct=3494.182] KIRK: WATCH THE OFFENSIVE LINE
[ct=3494.467] IN THE INTERIOR.
[ct=3496.249] I FEEL LIKE THEY GAVE THIS A WAY
[ct=3496.826] TO ALLOW CUNNINGHAM TO READ
[ct=3501.516] HE NEVER HAD A CHANCE BECAUSE
[ct=3502.666] READING THE GUARDS LED HIM TO
[ct=3504.160] ANTICIPATE THE SCREEN BEING
[ct=3505.947] THROWN.
[ct=3508.868] AL: LOSS OF FIVE.
[ct=3509.531] SECOND AND 15.
[ct=3512.726] THAT GOES NOWHERE.
[ct=3516.934] MADDISON BACK IN THE LINE OF
[ct=3517.139] SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=3521.179] LAST YEAR, THIS WAS A TEAM,
[ct=3523.807] MINNESOTA, 11-0 IN ONE POSITION
[ct=3524.893] GAMES.
[ct=3526.670] THIS IS CALLED REVERTING TO THE
[ct=3526.670] MEAN RIGHT NOW.
[ct=3530.281] KIRK: ABSOLUTELY.
[ct=3532.005] THEY ALWAYS SEEMED TO FIND A
[ct=3533.255] WAY, BUT THEY PLAY CLEAN
[ct=3533.914] FOOTBALL FOR THE MOST PART.
[ct=3537.967] COUSINS THREW SOME PIX, BUT
[ct=3538.285] TONIGHT IT'S BEEN A DISASTER
[ct=3542.037] WITH TURNOVERS LIKE IN WEEK ONE.
[ct=3546.927] AL: THIRD AND 15.
[ct=3553.176] COUSINS FIRES DOWN THE SIDELINE,
[ct=3559.443] REMEMBER, THIS IS STILL A TEAM
[ct=3562.481] THAT WAS DOWN 33-0 LAST YEAR SO
[ct=3563.094] DON'T TOUCH THAT DIAL JUST YET.
[ct=3573.354] KIRK: THAT PHILADELPHIA DEFENSE
[ct=3575.103] AFTER THE SUDDEN CHANGE, GREAT
[ct=3575.654] JOB.
[ct=3576.263] YOU THINK MINNESOTA WILL TRY TO
[ct=3579.573] PUT A DRIVE TOGETHER AND INSTEAD
[ct=3580.555] THEY GET A THREE AND OUT.
[ct=3584.775] AL: COUSINS IN THE FOURTH
[ct=3588.950] QUARTER, HE HAD, WHAT, RIGHT
[ct=3589.909] COMEBACKS BETWEEN THE FOURTH
[ct=3590.716] QUARTER AND OVERTIME?
[ct=3592.130] AL: HE DID.
[ct=3596.805] HERTZ GOING TO TAKE OFF AND NOT
[ct=3598.984] GO VERY FAR.
[ct=3602.020] HE IS DOWN AFTER AGAIN OF ONE.
[ct=3604.505] KIRK: JUST NOTHING DOWNFIELD.
[ct=3607.746] BRIAN FLORES DROPPING FIVE
[ct=3610.205] DEFENSIVE BACKS, DETERMINED NOT
[ct=3611.875] TO GIVE THE BIG PLAYS UP TO
[ct=3613.885] DEVONTA SMITH AND A.J. BROWN.
[ct=3616.194] AGAIN, YOU'RE EITHER GOING TO
[ct=3617.673] CHECK IT DOWN OR HAVE TO RUN THE
[ct=3620.135] FOOTBALL AND SCRAMBLE AND CREATE
[ct=3620.135] FOR JALEN HURTS.
[ct=3622.800] AS MUCH AS THEY WANT TO TRY AND
[ct=3625.863] ATTACK DOWNFIELD I THINK THEY
[ct=3627.747] HAVE TO HIT SOME CROSSERS
[ct=3631.241] NOTHING RIGHT NOW VERTICALLY.
[ct=3638.245] HIS GOOD NIGHT CONTINUES.
[ct=3640.905] HE TAKES IT TO THE 37 YARD LINE.
[ct=3644.368] HE HAS CARRIED THE BALL 14 TIMES
[ct=3644.698] FOR 73 YARDS.
[ct=3647.535] KIRK: IF YOU ARE WATCHING HIM
[ct=3650.772] FOR A PHILADELPHIA FAN, DETROIT,
[ct=3651.204] A LOT OF TIMES HE IS CATCHING
[ct=3651.803] THE BALL IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=3654.275] WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS VISION
[ct=3654.494] AND PATIENCE.
[ct=3658.949] EVEN ON THAT RUN, TO GIVE THEM A
[ct=3660.768] CHANCE OF THIRD AND 4.
[ct=3663.341] INSTEAD OF PANICKING AND
[ct=3665.025] POWERING THROUGH, HE WAITED
[ct=3668.025] PATIENTLY, CUT BACK, AND FOUND
[ct=3668.269] SOME POSITIVE YARDS.
[ct=3679.122] AL: THIRD AND 4.
[ct=3680.655] WIDE OPEN!
[ct=3685.497] IT IS SMITH AGAIN, ALL THE WAY
[ct=3685.944] FOR THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=3691.583] JORDAN HICKS PUT THE PRESSURE
[ct=3693.771] ON, BUT HE GOT IT AWAY.
[ct=3698.199] 63 YARDS AND THE EAGLES GO UP
[ct=3699.296] 26-7.
[ct=3702.529] KIRK: GREAT JOB HERE BY JALEN
[ct=3705.494] HE GETS PRESSURE RIGHT HERE AND
[ct=3705.848] GETS INTO HIS FACE.
[ct=3708.282] I JUST TALKED ABOUT HOW THESE
[ct=3708.800] SAFETIES ARE GETTING THE.
[ct=3711.715] HARRISON SMITH KIND OF HOLDS HIS
[ct=3714.524] GROUND, OPENS UP THE BACK END,
[ct=3716.302] AND THERE IS THE HOME RUNCELEBRA
[ct=3721.723] SCORES TWO TOUCHDOWNS TONIGHT ON
[ct=3722.501] 63 AND 34 YARD CATCHES.
[ct=3726.051] THE 63 YARDER WAS THE TD.
[ct=3729.350] 54 ONLY TOOK HIM TJUST TALKING A
[ct=3733.618] HE SAID, I CAN’
[ct=3734.048] HE SAID, I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW
[ct=3734.755] HARD IT IS TO SCORE TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=3736.997] IN COLLEGE IT IS PRETTY EASY.
[ct=3741.265] HE SAID HE AND AJAY GO BACK AND
[ct=3741.713] FORTH ABOUT HOW TOUGH IT IS.
[ct=3744.003] HE GETS TWO TONIGHT.
[ct=3746.267] AL: THREE ON THE SEASON.
[ct=3751.166] KAYLEE: A.J. HAS TWO KIDS OF HIS
[ct=3752.946] OWN AND HE HAS GIVEN DEVONTA
[ct=3756.010] SOME ADVICE, SAYING SLEEP WHEN
[ct=3756.730] BABY GIRL SLEEPS.
[ct=3760.096] HE TURNS THE LIGHTS ON IN THE
[ct=3760.571] EAGLES FACILITY.
[ct=3764.611] A.J. SAID, YEAH, WE WILL SEE IF
[ct=3764.873] THAT CONTINUES.
[ct=3768.671] AL: IT'S ABOUT AS GOOD AS IT
[ct=3770.476] GETS, A ONE-TWO PUNCH.
[ct=3774.937] FIRST DOWN, FORWARD PROGRESS TO
[ct=3776.822] JUSTIN JEFFERSON WHO HAULS IN
[ct=3780.704] HIS SIXTH CATCH OF THE NIGHT FOR
[ct=3781.003] 69 YARDS.
[ct=3783.266] KIRK: GIVING HIM SOME SOFT
[ct=3783.719] COVERAGE.
[ct=3786.399] WITH THIS LEAD HE IS COMFORTABLE
[ct=3787.063] IN DOING THAT.
[ct=3789.019] GOOD JOB BY KIRK COUSINS.
[ct=3792.178] LOOKED LIKE HE WAS LOOKING OUT
[ct=3792.520] TO C.J. HAM AND.
[ct=3794.255] FOUND THE MATCHUP HE WANTED.
[ct=3795.748] AL: PRESSURE.
[ct=3797.976] HENNESSEY THROWS IT AWAY.
[ct=3801.963] GETS IT AWAY, ANYWAY, TO JOSH
[ct=3803.200] OLIVER FOR NO GAIN.
[ct=3806.514] NICHOLAS MORROW CAME FLYING
[ct=3806.748] THROUGH.
[ct=3809.957] KIRK: GOOD WELL-TIMED THE BLITZ
[ct=3810.711] AND IT AFFECTS THE TIMING.
[ct=3814.779] MORROW IN FOR DEAN, AND HE COMES
[ct=3815.219] FREE.
[ct=3818.052] OFFENSIVE LINE TO THEIR LEFT, FR
[ct=3820.594] EED UP THAT RIGHT SIDE.
[ct=3823.229] MORROW VERY CLOSE TO GETTING TO
[ct=3825.395] COUSINS, AND THAT IS WHERE THAT
[ct=3827.950] EXPERIENCE, SMART ENOUGH TO GET
[ct=3828.339] THE BALL OUT OF HIS HANDS.
[ct=3833.132] AL: COUSINS FIRES.
[ct=3835.965] AND JEFFERSON CAN’
[ct=3836.459] AND JEFFERSON CAN'T HANDLE IT.
[ct=3842.052] BROKEN UP BY BIG NUMBER 2,
[ct=3842.473] DARIUS SLAY.
[ct=3846.765] KIRK: HE WAS FRUSTRATED RIGHT
[ct=3846.765] WHEN HE CAME UP.
[ct=3849.083] THIS TIME'S LEG GETS UP A LOT
[ct=3849.303] TIGHTER.
[ct=3853.296] RIGHT AT THE BREAK HE GRABBED
[ct=3853.826] ONTO THE JERSEY.
[ct=3855.198] THAT IS THE CALL I THINK HE
[ct=3855.454] WANTED.
[ct=3857.119] YOU AGREE WITH THAT?
[ct=3859.398] IT LOOKED LIKE A HOLE THERE.
[ct=3860.443] >> IT DID.
[ct=3862.845] SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEFENSIVE
[ct=3863.120] HOLDING.
[ct=3868.820] AL: NOTHING GOING RIGHT FOR THE
[ct=3870.670] MINNESOTA VIKINGS TONIGHT.
[ct=3872.085] DOWN BY 20.
[ct=3875.092] CROWD ROARING AGAIN.
[ct=3876.713] THIRD AND 10.
[ct=3878.623] PRESSURE ON COUSINS.
[ct=3881.856] STEPS UP, THROWS, CAUGHT!
[ct=3884.981] THAT'S THE RICKY ADDISON WITH A
[ct=3889.567] JOSH JOBE COVERING ON THE PLAY.
[ct=3893.516] FOR THE SECOND GAME IN A ROW,
[ct=3895.061] ADDISON IS IN FOR A SCORE.
[ct=3897.954] KIRK: THIS IS THE EXPERIENCE OF
[ct=3898.340] COUSINS.
[ct=3900.121] HE IS LOOKING LEFT THE ENTIRE
[ct=3900.121] WAY.
[ct=3903.240] WANTS TO BE ABLE TO THROW, AND
[ct=3904.422] THEN YOU GET A ONE-ON-ONE
[ct=3904.838] MATCHUP HERE.
[ct=3907.304] WATCH KIRK COUSINS, HIS EYES.
[ct=3910.094] AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT AFTER HE
[ct=3911.707] STEPS UP, HE MOVES HIS SAFETY
[ct=3913.921] THERE AND THEN SEES THE
[ct=3914.514] ONE-ON-ONE MATCHUP.
[ct=3918.169] KEVIN MANGANO SAID WE NEED TO
[ct=3919.865] FIND A GUY WHO CAN WIN
[ct=3920.760] ONE-ON-ONE AND THEY FOUND
[ct=3921.168] ADDISON.
[ct=3922.939] AL: THAT WAS TEXTBOOK.
[ct=3924.615] GREAT DESCRIPTION OF THAT.
[ct=3927.008] THE KICK IS GOOD BY JOSEPH.
[ct=3929.920] SO, MINNESOTA TRYING TO HANG IN
[ct=3935.307] JOSEPH TO KICK OFF.
[ct=3939.902] A 13 POINT GAME AFTER THE 62
[ct=3941.518] YARD TOUCHDOWN ON A THIRD DOWN
[ct=3942.066] AND 10.
[ct=3944.822] KIRK: THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT
[ct=3947.168] MINNESOTA OBVIOUSLY NEEDED, WAS
[ct=3947.168] A BIG PLAY.
[ct=3950.392] YOU HAVE TO GIVE KIRK COUSINS A
[ct=3951.259] LOT OF CREDIT FOR NOT PANICKING,
[ct=3952.392] NOT LOSING HIS COOL.
[ct=3954.509] HE KNOWS THERE IS STILL A LONG
[ct=3956.520] WAY TO GO AND THEY ARE ABLE TO
[ct=3956.984] CLIMB BACK INTO THIS GAME.
[ct=3958.999] THEIR DEFENSE HAS BEEN PLAYING
[ct=3961.103] ONE OF THE FEW TIMES WE SAW
[ct=3964.027] MAN-TO-MAN COVERAGE, JALEN HURTS
[ct=3965.688] MADE HIM PAY FOR IT WITH THAT
[ct=3966.105] BIG THROW TO DEVONTA SMITH.
[ct=3969.202] WE WILL SEE WHAT BRIAN FLORES
[ct=3970.694] ADJUSTS BACK NOW TO DEFENSIVELY.
[ct=3975.616] AL: HURTS, 11 OF 14 FOR 147.
[ct=3979.857] OF COURSE THOSE TWO BOMBS TO
[ct=3982.350] SMITH, MOST OF IT.
[ct=3982.581] PASS IS CAUGHT, GAIN OF 9.
[ct=3987.387] KAYLEE: RIGHT TACKLE LANE
[ct=3989.141] JOHNSON WAS JUST DOING SOME
[ct=3990.840] RELEASE WORK ON HIS LEFT GROIN.
[ct=3994.531] HE HAD ISSUES WITH IT LAST YEAR
[ct=3995.349] AND MISSED TIME BECAUSE OF IT.
[ct=3996.967] THE EAGLES ARE WITHOUT RUNNING
[ct=3997.943] BACK BOSTON SCOTT.
[ct=4000.740] HE IS BEING EVALUATED IN
[ct=4001.603] CONCUSSION PROTOCOL.
[ct=4004.268] WATKINS THE RECEIVER IS OUT.
[ct=4007.149] ON DEFENSE, THE VON TO MINIX IS
[ct=4007.867] OUT AS WELL.
[ct=4014.159] AL: WE SAW PENNY ON THE KICK
[ct=4017.505] SWIFT BREAKS ONE AND A NICE
[ct=4018.036] TACKLE TO AVOID A LONGER GAME
[ct=4020.242] THERE BY CAMRYN BYNUM.
[ct=4021.824] THE FLAG IS DOWN.
[ct=4024.403] KIRK: LANDON DICKERSON ON A HOLD
[ct=4028.966] >> HOLDING, OFFENSE NUMBER 69.
[ct=4033.508] KIRK: ONE OF THE FEW MISTAKES WE
[ct=4033.772] HAVE SEEN BY THIS OFFENSIVE
[ct=4036.555] LEFT GUARD LOCKS UP DEAN LOWRY.
[ct=4039.906] ANY TIME YOU SEE A BALL BOUNCE,
[ct=4041.312] DEFENDER TRYING TO WORK OUT, YOU
[ct=4042.043] CAN SEE THEM GRAB ONTO THAT
[ct=4042.296] JERSEY.
[ct=4043.630] GOOD CALL BY THE OFFICIAL.
[ct=4045.765] THIS IS WHAT PHILADELPHIA DEALT
[ct=4046.280] WITH LAST WEEK.
[ct=4049.443] MAKING SOME MISTAKES, GETTING
[ct=4049.802] BEYOND THE STICKS.
[ct=4054.376] THE RUN GAME COORDINATOR, ONE OF
[ct=4055.996] THE TOP OFFENSIVE LINE COACHES
[ct=4056.602] IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.
[ct=4059.598] IN THE NFL.
[ct=4064.075] AL: SECOND DOWN AND 11, BALL AT
[ct=4064.684] THE 23 YARD LINE.
[ct=4068.871] RUSH ONLY 3.
[ct=4073.158] SEND IT OUT TO SWIFT, GOOD
[ct=4074.782] TACKLE ON THE OUTSIDE BY BYRON
[ct=4074.782] MURPHY.
[ct=4079.134] SO THIRD DOWN AND 6 COMING UP.
[ct=4082.074] CLOCK UNDER EIGHT MINUTES TO GO
[ct=4082.629] IN THE THIRD.
[ct=4085.588] KIRK: COUSINS SAYS JUST GET ME
[ct=4085.848] THE FOOTBALL BACK.
[ct=4087.424] WE WANT TO GET WITHIN A
[ct=4089.499] POSSESSION, HAVE A CHANCE AGAIN
[ct=4091.105] TO KEEP THAT MAGIC GOING FROM
[ct=4092.906] LAST YEAR, THOSE FOURTH-QUARTER
[ct=4093.854] COMEBACKS THAT HE HAD.
[ct=4096.873] ONE THING YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT
[ct=4098.767] IS YOU DO IT THAT OFTEN, YOU DO
[ct=4099.502] BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN DO IT.
[ct=4102.612] AL: YOU ARE DOWN 33-0, YOU
[ct=4104.255] BELIEVE IN ANYTHING.
[ct=4105.010] KIRK: NO DOUBT.
[ct=4108.431] >> FALSE START, OFFENSE NUMBER
[ct=4108.865] 0.
[ct=4110.515] 5 YARD PENALTY.
[ct=4114.117] AL: SWIFT OVERANXIOUS.
[ct=4116.695] KIRK: TRIED TO SELL IT, ANYWAY.
[ct=4118.505] LOST HIS BALANCE.
[ct=4121.375] HE JUMPS AND THEN ASK LIKE HE
[ct=4121.634] MEANT TO DO IT.
[ct=4125.273] NO, NO, WATCH THE BLITZ.
[ct=4127.200] [LAUGHS]
[ct=4131.390] AL: VIKINGS WITHOUT A PENALTY
[ct=4131.390] TONIGHT.
[ct=4134.345] BUT FOUR TURNOVERS.
[ct=4137.918] THIRD AND 11.
[ct=4147.017] AGAIN, JUST RUSHING 3, DROPPING
[ct=4147.017] 8.
[ct=4152.415] SEEN A LOT OF ACTION TONIGHT,
[ct=4153.559] NEXT TO NO ACTION LAST WEEK.
[ct=4155.574] AND THAT WILL MAKE IT FOURTH
[ct=4158.811] KIRK: MINNESOTA CAPITALIZING ON
[ct=4160.628] A FEW MISCUES HERE BY
[ct=4162.136] PHILADELPHIA WITHOUT HOLDING
[ct=4164.182] CALL, THE FALSE START.
[ct=4167.361] PHILADELPHIA GOES BACKWARDS AND
[ct=4168.138] THE VIKINGS DO THEIR JOB.
[ct=4171.365] GET KIRK COUSINS THE BALL BACK,
[ct=4173.133] NOW DOWN 13.
[ct=4176.588] AL: BRANDON POWELL, FORMER RAM,
[ct=4179.094] SETS UP INSIDE HIS OWN 30.
[ct=4184.500] ARRYN SIPOSS SENDS IT HIS WAY ON
[ct=4185.459] AN ANGLE.
[ct=4190.537] LET'S IT BOUNCE, AND AN EAGLE IS
[ct=4191.849] THE FIRST TO TOUCH IT, SO IT
[ct=4193.424] WILL BE DOWN AT THAT SPOT.
[ct=4198.521] 6:19 REMAINING NOW IN THE THIRD
[ct=4200.519] BEGINNING OF WEEK TWO OF THE
[ct=4202.653] 2023 NFL SEASON.
[ct=4204.499] PHILLY UP 27-14.
[ct=4210.038] CLARA, THE
[ct=4210.959] GIANTS AND THE 49ERS ON THURSDAY
[ct=4211.543] NIGHT FOOTBALL.
[ct=4213.935] MEANWHILE, COUSINS AND THE
[ct=4214.969] VIKINGS TRYING TO GET ALL THE
[ct=4217.402] WAY BACK IN IT, AS MEDICINE
[ct=4219.088] PICKS UP FOUR.
[ct=4221.899] KIRK: ALL THINGS CONSIDERED
[ct=4223.692] UPFRONT FOR MINNESOTA, THEY HAVE
[ct=4226.096] HAD AN UPHILL BATTLE AGAINST
[ct=4227.343] THIS PHILADELPHIA DEFENSIVE
[ct=4229.364] DOING A GOOD JOB OF TRYING TO
[ct=4231.145] MIX THIS PLAYCALLING UP.
[ct=4234.387] AL: ROLLING, HAS TIME, THROWS,
[ct=4238.227] CAUGHT, BUT WELL SHORT OF A
[ct=4238.696] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4241.080] JORDAN ADDISON MAKING THE GRAB
[ct=4243.111] THERE, THIRD AND SHORT.
[ct=4246.318] KIRK: WHEN THEY HAVE GOTTEN THE
[ct=4247.402] EAGLES ON THEIR HEELS IT HAS
[ct=4249.376] BEEN A MIX OF CHANGE OF TEMPO,
[ct=4251.980] MOVING COUSINS AROUND, ANYTHING
[ct=4252.530] TO SLOW DOWN THAT FRONT.
[ct=4262.259] COUSINS HANGS IN THE POCKET,
[ct=4265.516] PASS IS INCOMPLETE, COVERAGE WAS
[ct=4265.516] GREAT.
[ct=4267.656] THAT WAS JEFFERSON OVER THE
[ct=4268.951] MIDDLE AND HE WAS COVERED BY THE
[ct=4270.266] LINEBACKER ZACH CUNNINGHAM.
[ct=4275.095] KIRK: AL IT, LOOKED LIKE FLESHER
[ct=4277.206] COX MAY HAVE GOTTEN HIS HAND ON
[ct=4278.904] HIS SHOULDER AS HE RELEASES THE
[ct=4279.407] BALL.
[ct=4282.161] RIGHT THERE, IT LOOKS LIKE HE
[ct=4282.875] GOT A GOOD PUSH ON HIM.
[ct=4286.006] REMEMBER, COUSINS GETS HIT MORE
[ct=4286.652] THAN ANYBODY.
[ct=4289.522] GREAT COVERAGE BY THE LINEBACKER
[ct=4289.745] CUNNINGHAM.
[ct=4297.276] IF YOU CAN GET A LINEBACKER ON
[ct=4298.651] JEFFERSON YOU WANT TO TAKE
[ct=4299.346] ADVANTAGE OF IT IF YOU CAN.
[ct=4301.216] RYAN WRIGHT.
[ct=4303.987] GOING TO LET IT BOUNCE, AND SO
[ct=4305.991] WILL THE VIKINGS.
[ct=4309.945] ALL THE WAY TO THE 8 YARD LINE.
[ct=4314.365] KIRK: DEVONTA SMITH IS THAT A
[ct=4317.610] -- HAS HAD A COUPLE CHANCES TO
[ct=4317.860] GET OUT.
[ct=4321.064] LOOKED LIKE HE MIGHT SCORE A
[ct=4323.876] ABLE TO CLIMB UP AND MAKE A
[ct=4324.330] GREAT PLAY.
[ct=4327.625] THIS IS WHERE HE GOT MAN-TO-MAN,
[ct=4327.637] WENT RIGHT BY EVANS.
[ct=4329.843] THAT IS WHERE JALEN HURTS GOT
[ct=4330.412] PRESSURED.
[ct=4332.518] THAT WAS A NICE 70 YARDER.
[ct=4336.449] WHEN HE GETS ONE-ON-ONE, HE IS
[ct=4338.144] AS GOOD AS ANYBODY AT CREATING
[ct=4339.658] THOSE FAVORABLE MATCHUP’
[ct=4340.110] THOSE FAVORABLE MATCHUP'S AND
[ct=4340.396] GETTING THE SEPARATION.
[ct=4345.502] AL: 57-YARD KICK.
[ct=4350.766] SPOT THE BALL AT THE 7-YARD
[ct=4354.480] THROUGH THE MIDDLE.
[ct=4357.080] WORKING HIS WAY OUT TO THE
[ct=4358.463] 11-YARD LINE.
[ct=4362.228] GAIN OF FOUR, AS THAT RUN GAME
[ct=4362.386] CONTINUES FOR SWIFT.
[ct=4366.109] 15 CARRIES, 77 YARDS.
[ct=4369.637] KIRK: REALLY IMPRESSIVE TO JUST
[ct=4370.016] WATCH HIM TONIGHT.
[ct=4376.002] IT'S ONE THING, WITH THE WAY
[ct=4376.625] GAIN WILL PLAYED LAST WEEK YOU
[ct=4378.879] THINK HE WILL BECOME THE GUY
[ct=4379.526] MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT SWIFT WOULD
[ct=4380.929] COME IN AND HAVE A ROLE.
[ct=4383.655] BUT MANY WONDERED WHAT IT WOULD
[ct=4384.177] BE.
[ct=4387.763] THEY HAVE ASKED HIM TO CARRY THE
[ct=4388.982] LOAD AND HE HAS HAD A HECKUVA
[ct=4391.222] NIGHT WITH THE OFFENSE OF LINE
[ct=4391.697] PAVING THE WAY.
[ct=4394.662] AL: BREAKS TACKLES, TO THE
[ct=4398.169] 20-YARD LINE HE GOES.
[ct=4403.296] A BLOCK BY THE LEFT TACKLE,
[ct=4409.861] KIRK: YOU CAN SEE IT PUTS A LOT
[ct=4410.167] OF PRESSURE.
[ct=4411.634] LOOK AT THAT HOLE.
[ct=4416.827] THE SAFETY IS COLLAPSING DOWN IN
[ct=4418.960] A HURRY, WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN
[ct=4419.111] DOING AGAINST HIS RUN GAME.
[ct=4423.666] BUT HE HAD SUCH GOOD BALANCE,
[ct=4424.868] PHYSICAL LOWER HALF, ABLE TO
[ct=4427.028] STAY OFF AND BOUNCE OFF THOSE
[ct=4427.330] SAFETIES.
[ct=4428.798] AL: FROM THE 20.
[ct=4431.608] HURTS, THROWS, CAUGHT.
[ct=4434.287] BUT AGAIN, ONLY A SHORT GAIN.
[ct=4438.589] THIS TIME IT IS GOTHARD AGAIN
[ct=4439.138] MAKING THE CATCH.
[ct=4442.242] HE'S COUGHT SIX TONIGHT BUT FOR
[ct=4443.963] ONLY 21 TOTAL YARDS.
[ct=4446.680] KIRK: YEAH, A QUIET NIGHT.
[ct=4449.042] IT HAS REALLY BEEN MORE ABOUT
[ct=4450.365] THIS RUNNING GAME, AND YOU
[ct=4450.937] CANNOT BLAME THEM.
[ct=4453.522] AL: I MEAN, FOR A LEAGUE WHICH
[ct=4458.313] IS ABOUT 60/40 PASS/RUN, PHILLY
[ct=4459.076] HAS RUN THE BALL 32 TIMES AND
[ct=4460.526] THROWN ONLY 20.
[ct=4463.618] SECOND ANF 5.
[ct=4467.625] RUN NUMBER 33.
[ct=4470.261] EFFECTIVE AGAIN.
[ct=4477.144] TACKLED UP AT THE 36 YARD LINE,
[ct=4477.582] THE ANDRE SWIFT.
[ct=4480.774] KIRK: AGAIN, YOU GO TO WHAT IS
[ct=4481.591] WORKING ON THAT NIGHT.
[ct=4484.310] SOME NIGHTS IT IS THROWING THE
[ct=4486.563] FOOTBALL, OTHER NIGHTS IT IS THE
[ct=4487.513] OFFENSIVE LINE HOLDING THINGS.
[ct=4489.980] THESE ARE BIG HOLES HE IS
[ct=4490.495] RUNNING THROUGH.
[ct=4492.904] YOU ARE ASKING LINEBACKERS AND
[ct=4494.629] THE SAFETIES TO COME DOWN AND
[ct=4495.081] MAKE PLAYS.
[ct=4498.890] THIS GUY IS 5'9", 215 POUNDS.
[ct=4501.535] IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF LOW
[ct=4502.959] CENTER OF GRAVITY THAT HE HAS.
[ct=4510.319] AL: AGAIN, HE'S OVER 100.
[ct=4515.114] CLOSE TO A FIRST, ON HIS 18TH
[ct=4517.213] CARRY OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=4519.181] HIS LONGEST GAIN IS ONLY 12
[ct=4521.318] YARDS BUT HE HAS PICKED UP 106
[ct=4521.819] TOTAL YARDS.
[ct=4524.566] KIRK: WATCH THIS OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=4527.599] HELP OUT, GET UP TO THAT
[ct=4527.599] LINEBACKER.
[ct=4531.427] AGAIN, THAT'S TWO UC BEARCATS
[ct=4532.022] GOING HEAD TO HEAD.
[ct=4535.503] THE HOLES ARE CONTINUING TO OPEN
[ct=4538.275] AS YOU WEAR DOWN THE DEFENSE
[ct=4538.938] INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER, THE
[ct=4541.114] HOLES CONTINUE TO GET BIGGER AND
[ct=4541.563] BIGGER.
[ct=4543.721] DEFENSE --
[ct=4547.819] AL: SOONER OR LATER YOU KNEW YOU
[ct=4547.999] WERE GOING TO SEE RASHAD PENNY,
[ct=4550.651] AND IT'S SOONER, THERE HE IS.
[ct=4553.325] FIRST CARRY IS AN EAGLE.
[ct=4556.313] TAKES IT ACROSS THE 50 FOR A
[ct=4560.031] UNDER TWO MINUTES TO GO NOW INTO
[ct=4560.394] THIRD.
[ct=4562.781] KIRK: THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS
[ct=4563.779] WITH THIS LEAD, THEY ARE UP 13.
[ct=4565.956] BUT IF YOU ARE A SAFETY IN THESE
[ct=4568.560] HOLES ARE OPENING UP, WHAT ARE
[ct=4568.853] YOU DOING?
[ct=4571.059] YOU ARE GETTING DOWNHILL IN A
[ct=4574.561] IF THIS GAME WERE CLOSER, IT
[ct=4576.295] WOULD BE A PERFECT TIME FOR
[ct=4577.127] BRIAN JOHNSON TO PUT THE BALL
[ct=4578.159] INTO THE BELLY OF THE BACK, HOLE
[ct=4581.715] IT OUT, AND CREATE A ONE-ON-ONE
[ct=4583.058] MATCHUP ON THE OUTSIDE WERE YOU
[ct=4584.413] COULD HIT A HOMERUN.
[ct=4587.406] BECAUSE THOSE SAFETIES RIGHT NOW
[ct=4588.781] ARE SENSING THEY HAVE TO GET
[ct=4589.046] DOWNHILL.
[ct=4601.628] AL: CAUGHT ON THE OUTSIDE IS PEN
[ct=4601.980] NY.
[ct=4604.378] PENY CAN STAY HEALTHY.
[ct=4607.504] WE HAVE SEEN HIM HAVE SOME BIG
[ct=4608.211] GAMES WITH THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS.
[ct=4610.182] BUT THE PROBLEM IS HE IS OFTEN
[ct=4610.182] INJURED.
[ct=4612.704] KIRK: YOU GO BACK TO 2021, JUST
[ct=4615.551] A COUPLE YEARS AGO, HE LED THE
[ct=4618.854] ENTIRE NFL IN YARDS PER CARRY.
[ct=4621.839] YOU ARE RIGHT, IT HAS BEEN MORE
[ct=4622.467] ABOUT JUST TRYING TO STAY
[ct=4625.473] HEALTHY AND BE THAT BACK WE ALL
[ct=4625.747] KNOW HE CAN BE.
[ct=4630.420] IN HIS 6TH YOU NOW OUT OF SAN
[ct=4630.651] DIEGO STATE.
[ct=4632.352] AL: SECOND AND 5.
[ct=4635.880] PENNY AGAIN.
[ct=4641.176] HALF A MINUTE TO GO.
[ct=4645.180] GOING TO LET THE CLOCK RUN DOWN
[ct=4645.311] ALL THE WAY TO THE FOURTH.
[ct=4647.551] GOING TO BE THIRD DOWN AND 3 AT
[ct=4649.638] THE RESUMPTION OF PLAY.
[ct=4653.837] IN THE MEANTIME, THE EAGLES AT
[ct=4655.050] LEAST KNOWING THE LINEUP, MAYBE
[ct=4657.291] TO TRY AND DRAW THEM OFFSIDE,
[ct=4658.925] MAYBE RUN A PLAY.
[ct=4660.913] AND THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THAT.
[ct=4663.595] IT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY PULLED
[ct=4663.595] OFF.
[ct=4665.932] HARRISON PHILLIPS CAME ACROSS
[ct=4665.932] THE LINE.
[ct=4673.703] YEAH, THEY WERE READY TO LET
[ct=4674.141] THE CLOCK RUN DOWN.
[ct=4676.523] KIRK: YOU CALLED IT, TRYING TO
[ct=4678.328] DRAW THEM OFF, AND IT WORKED.
[ct=4683.765] >> DEFENSE, FIVE YARD PENALTY,
[ct=4684.252] RESULTS IN A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4687.107] AL: WHEN YOU OVER DRAMATIZE
[ct=4688.282] COMING UP TO THE LINE IN A
[ct=4690.072] SITUATION LIKE THAT AND
[ct=4690.490] EVERYBODY IS MOVING AROUND A
[ct=4692.497] LITTLE BIT, SOMETHING IS COMING.
[ct=4695.148] THAT IS THE FIRST VIKINGS
[ct=4696.438] PENALTY OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=4701.711] AND YOU CAN WIND THE CLOCK, AND
[ct=4701.928] IT WILL TAKE US TO THE FOURTH.
[ct=4704.736] WE HAVE PLAYED THREE.
[ct=4707.995] INLOST THE GAME.
[ct=4710.409] HE SAID HE WILL CONVEY THAT TO
[ct=4710.970] HIS TEAMMATES.
[ct=4714.023] AL: FIRST AND 10.
[ct=4717.992] AS PER HERTZ THROWS TO THE
[ct=4719.855] F ANYONE CAN WALK HIM
[ct=4722.879] BACK -- WE ARE POUNDING THE
[ct=4724.759] BALL, IT IS WHAT IT IS.
[ct=4727.519] AL: YOU WILL HAVE YOUR NIGHTS.
[ct=4734.932] WHO'SE OX IS GETTING GORED?
[ct=4739.882] KIRK: IF ANYONE WANTS TO PAT ME
[ct=4743.487] ON THE BACK FOR THE SUPER BOWL,
[ct=4746.643] IF WE HAD WON I WOULD BE HAPPY.
[ct=4748.158] I THOUGHT IT WAS NEAT THAT HE
[ct=4748.932] WOULD TELL THAT TO HIS TEAM.
[ct=4753.053] JUST FOR NIGHT
[ct=4758.201] AL: SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO BE THE
[ct=4758.562] BABYSITTER FOR YOUR RECEIVERS.
[ct=4761.974] KIRK: IT IS THE HEAT OF THE
[ct=4763.771] MOMENT AND FIRE THAT MAKES THEM
[ct=4764.121] SO GOOD.
[ct=4767.807] AL: THIRD AND NINE.
[ct=4772.796] RUSHING MOST OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=4776.017] THIS PASS IS CAUGHT BUT A
[ct=4779.982] LITTLE SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4781.298] SMITH TACKLED BY JACKSON.
[ct=4785.256] THEY WILL MARK IT AT THE 27 AND
[ct=4786.603] MAKE IT FORTH AND ONE.
[ct=4789.812] KIRK: HE HAS A COUPLE TOUCHDOWN
[ct=4791.073] PASSES BUT THIS IS A GREAT JOB.
[ct=4794.299] THE TIMING, RHYTHMIC,
[ct=4795.883] THROW.
[ct=4797.243] AL: PUSHING.
[ct=4799.801] FIRST DOWN!
[ct=4805.007] AND YOU RUN THAT PUSH PLAY AND
[ct=4806.317] IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AND
[ct=4809.012] JALEN HURTS HAS BEEN FANTASTIC.
[ct=4812.928] KIRK: I SAW A GRAPHIC THIS
[ct=4814.207] MORNING AND I THINK HE MISSED IT
[ct=4814.207] ONE TIME.
[ct=4818.139] ON THE ONE TIME HE DID NOT MAKE
[ct=4819.516] IT ON FOR THAN ONE.
[ct=4822.219] I THINK BACK TO LAST YEAR, LOOK
[ct=4825.101] AT POOR HARRISON SMITH JUMPING
[ct=4826.173] ON TOP OF THE PILE AND GOING FOR
[ct=4827.529] A RIDE.
[ct=4830.155] AL: FOURTH AND ONE.
[ct=4832.923] LAST YEAR, 10 RUSHES AND NINE
[ct=4834.174] FIRST DOWNS.
[ct=4835.498] 1-1 TONIGHT.
[ct=4839.526] TWO MINUTES INTO THE FOURTH FROM
[ct=4840.825] THE 29 YARD LINE.
[ct=4843.441] NICE BLOCKING IN FRANCE.
[ct=4850.092] THE PASS TO BROWN FOR THE
[ct=4851.398] TOUCHDOWN BUT THE FLAG IS DOWN
[ct=4852.727] AT THE 33 YARD LINE.
[ct=4855.443] KIRK: THEY WILL GIVE PENNY WHO
[ct=4856.748] PICKED UP THE BLITZ.
[ct=4862.104] >> HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER 23.
[ct=4864.686] AL: IT COMES BACK.
[ct=4867.394] KIRK: THE BLITZ COMES UP THE
[ct=4871.395] IT MAY HAVE CAUGHT HIM BY
[ct=4871.395] SURPRISE.
[ct=4875.380] A GOOD EFFORT BY THE ROOKIE PACE
[ct=4876.650] JUNIOR TO GET AROUND HIM WHICH
[ct=4877.957] CAUSED THE HOLD AND THE PENALTY
[ct=4880.680] WHICH NEGATES THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=4886.023] AL: THE EGOS HAVE NOT SEEN THAT
[ct=4886.023] IN A WHILE.
[ct=4888.612] THE VIKINGS ARE RUSHING
[ct=4889.986] A LOT OF PASS PLAYS.
[ct=4893.902] KIRK: MINNESOTA DOING THE BEST
[ct=4894.584] JOB THEY CAN TO ROTATE BODIES.
[ct=4898.619] NOT A TON OF DEPTH WITH TIME OF
[ct=4901.737] NOT A STATISTIC YOU THINK OF IN
[ct=4905.067] A NFL GAME BUT TIME OF
[ct=4908.663] POSSESSION IS LIKE 33 MINUTES TO
[ct=4909.538] 13 FAVORING PHILADELPHIA.
[ct=4912.235] THEY ARE KEEPING THE BALL AWAY
[ct=4912.488] FROM KIRK COUSINS.
[ct=4915.329] AL: HE WAS A LITTLE SLOW IN
[ct=4917.542] GETTING UP.
[ct=4918.155] FIRST AND 20 OFF THE FATE.
[ct=4925.253] GOING DEEP AGAIN FOR BROWN!
[ct=4925.712] CANNOT MAKE THE CATCH.
[ct=4928.127] BROWN LOOKING FOR A FLAG, NO.
[ct=4930.178] HE GETS NINE.
[ct=4932.975] EVANS COVERING ON THE PLAY GOT
[ct=4932.975] HURT EARLIER.
[ct=4937.057] KIRK: TALKING ABOUT BROWN AND HE
[ct=4939.030] WALKS OVER TO THE SIDELINE WITH
[ct=4941.678] A LITTLE SLANT ANDIS A FRAME
[ct=4945.924] OR TWO EARLY BUT IN REAL-TIME
[ct=4948.340] THE BALL IS COMING IN AS THE
[ct=4948.572] CONTACT OCCURS.
[ct=4949.686] THEY DON’
[ct=4951.879] THEY DON'T CALL THAT AS PASS
[ct=4954.003] INTERFERENCE BECAUSE IN REAL
[ct=4955.639] TIME IT IS BANG BANG.
[ct=4958.772] KIRK: EVANS GETTING WORKED ON.
[ct=4963.687] AL: SECOND AND 20 FROM THE 35
[ct=4968.603] JALEN HURTS WITH A TON OF TIME.
[ct=4970.140] SURVEYING.
[ct=4971.946] FLUSHED OUT.
[ct=4975.479] THE SECONDARY DID ITS JOB.
[ct=4979.632] HUNTER WHO HAD A BIG RUSH EARLY
[ct=4980.242] ON AND HAS BEEN QUIET SINCE THEN
[ct=4983.484] THOUGH THEY REALLY HAVE BEEN
[ct=4983.934] ONLY RUSHING THREE.
[ct=4988.341] KIRK: LOOK AT THE TOP OF YOUR
[ct=4989.480] SCREEN, FIVE DEFENDERS BACK
[ct=4993.557] THEY TAKE AWAY THE UNDERNEATH.
[ct=4994.897] EVENTUALLY A RECEIVER
[ct=4996.316] BUT JALEN HURTS IS RUNNING FOR
[ct=4996.316] HIS LIFE.
[ct=4999.882] IN THE PREVIOUS PLAY THEY WERE
[ct=5002.481] LOOKING AT, IT WAS A CLOSE CALL.
[ct=5006.425] A RARE MAN-TO-MAN OPPORTUNITY
[ct=5007.803] FOR BROWN THAT HE JUST MISSED
[ct=5012.211] AL: THIRD AND 23.
[ct=5012.775] JALEN HURTS.
[ct=5015.963] THERE IS A HUNTER AGAIN AND THIS
[ct=5016.936] TIME HE TAKES HIM DOWN BACK BY
[ct=5019.662] THE 50 YARD LINE.
[ct=5026.412] NEIL HUNTER, OUT OF --
[ct=5031.917] KIRK: LAST YEAR 10.5 SACKS.
[ct=5037.994] EASING HIS WAY UP RESPECTFUL OF
[ct=5038.478] THE SPEED OF JALEN HURTS.
[ct=5041.362] HE DOES NOT GRAB THE FACEMASK.
[ct=5044.649] GOOD JOB BY COVERAGE TO FREE HIM
[ct=5050.319] AL: A 12 YARD SACK TAKING HIM
[ct=5050.834] OUT OF JAKE ELLIOTT’
[ct=5052.588] OUT OF JAKE ELLIOTT'S FIELD GOAL
[ct=5053.073] RANGE.
[ct=5056.483] FAIL CATCH -- FAIR CATCH MADE.
[ct=5062.187] 11:19 LEFT IN THE FOURTH.

[ct=5071.015] : VIKINGS TRYING TO CLIMB INTO
[ct=5073.518] IT AND HANG IN.
[ct=5078.248] HUNTER WITH THE SACK HAS THREE

[ct=5082.156] AND ONE LAST WEEK.
[ct=5082.156] FOUR ON THE SEASON.
[ct=5092.800] IT IS MATTESON -- MATTISON WHO
[ct=5094.422] TAKES THE TOSS AFTER A GAIN OF
[ct=5094.918] EIGHT YARDS.
[ct=5098.728] KIRK: IT FEELS LIKE THE GAME IS
[ct=5100.162] OVER BUT THEY ARE A TOUCHDOWN
[ct=5102.261] AWAY FROM THIS BEING A ONE
[ct=5102.753] POSSESSION GAME.
[ct=5105.013] THERE ARE 11 MINUTES TO GO.
[ct=5107.976] THAT WAS A POTENTIAL KNOCKOUT
[ct=5111.376] PUNCH DRIVE FOR PHILADELPHIA AND
[ct=5112.114] THEY MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY AND
[ct=5113.743] GIVE THE BALL BACK TO COUSINS.
[ct=5120.020] AL: AND YOU HAVE JEFFERSON, AND
[ct=5120.522] ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.
[ct=5123.941] SECOND AND THREE.
[ct=5124.229] COUSINS FIRE IS.

[ct=5128.021] 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=5131.868] K.J. OSBORN LOOKING UPFIELD

[ct=5141.852] THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD IS WIDE
[ct=5143.965] OPEN RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM.
[ct=5148.797] ONE-ON-ONE AGAINST THE SAFETY,
[ct=5148.797] EDMONDS.
[ct=5151.258] I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS THINKING
[ct=5154.249] ABOUT WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF HIM
[ct=5154.910] BUT HE LOSES HIS FOCUS.
[ct=5160.371] AL: THIRD AND THREE.
[ct=5165.191] COUSINS FLOATS IT.
[ct=5169.991] JEFFERSON WIGGLES HIS WAY OUT TO

[ct=5175.600] JOSH SWEAT CAME IN AND BURIED
[ct=5178.248] COUSINS AS HE THREW IT BUT A BIG

[ct=5208.071] A GAIN OF SIX.
[ct=5210.580] DOWN TO 10 MINUTES TO GO IN
[ct=5210.881] REGULATION.

[ct=5218.124] OPPORTUNITY TO PUT THIS GAME OUT
[ct=5218.124] OF REACH.
[ct=5220.751] AL: OFF THE FAKE.

[ct=5288.122] TRYING TO HOPE THE TREND WILL

[ct=5298.506] POINTS THAN THEY SCORED.
[ct=5303.292] SECOND AND 10.

[ct=5364.199] THIS IS JEFFERSON.
[ct=5366.613] WHERE IS THE ADJUSTMENT?
[ct=5370.098] LINEBACKERS ARE CALLING HIM TO
[ct=5373.228] COME OVER THAT IS STEALING FOR
[ct=5373.459] KIRK COUSINS.
[ct=5376.192] AL: JEFFERSON IS HAPPY TO GET
[ct=5380.514] AWAY FROM SLAY AND TAKES IT TO
[ct=5381.622] THE 10 SO IT IS A FIRST AND
[ct=5383.465] GOAL.
[ct=5385.542] LOOK OUT FROM BEHIND.

[ct=5411.702] WATCH HIM ON THE CROSS OR AND
[ct=5412.211] THE HESITATION.
[ct=5414.141] AND THAT IS WHY THERE IS A BUST.
[ct=5416.919] YOU ARE PLAYING A LOT OF GUYS
[ct=5418.562] THAT HAVE NOT PLAYED A LOT OF
[ct=5423.425] JOBE IN FOR BRADBERRY.

[ct=5465.302] ATTENTION.
[ct=5469.348] -- THE BACKS ARE GETTING A LOT
[ct=5469.560] OF ATTENTION.
[ct=5473.209] IT IS BEEN THE OFFENSIVE LINE
[ct=5473.677] THOUGH.
[ct=5478.043] GREAT PUSH.
[ct=5479.278] GREAT COMMUNICATION BECAUSE
[ct=5480.010] MINNESOTA IS MOVING AROUND SO
[ct=5480.010] MUCH.
[ct=5483.600] BUT NOW WE HAVE A SIX-POINT GAME
[ct=5485.855] AND THIS WILL BE A DIFFERENT
[ct=5486.143] ENERGY FROM THE VIKING DEFENSE.

[ct=5584.095] KIRK: ONE BACK AND TWO TITANS.
[ct=5587.282] PHILADELPHIA LAST YEAR WAS THE
[ct=5587.935] TEAM THAT WOULD MIX THINGS UP.

[ct=5594.949] END LOOKS TO GIVE THEM THAT

[ct=5638.612] CAUGHT, BRO
[ct=5643.136] KIRK: NICE TIMING.
[ct=5644.922] JALEN HURTS THE LAST FEW TIMES

[ct=5649.623] WATCH ON THE LEFT AND WATCH HOW
[ct=5651.113] HE WORKS OFF THE LEVERAGE OF THE

[ct=5661.658] HE DOES NOT HAVE A GOOD FEEL FOR
[ct=5662.128] SPACE OUT THERE AND ON THIRD

[ct=5714.473] IN A CROWDED BACKFIELD BACK IN
[ct=5714.768] PHILADELPHIA WHERE HE WENT TO
[ct=5714.768] HIGH SCHOOL.

[ct=5724.293] AL: 165 ON THE NIGHT AND 43 ON
[ct=5727.799] FIRST AND GOAL.
[ct=5729.000] THE VIKINGS IN NO MAN'S LAND.

[ct=5731.756] WHAT DO YOU DO?
[ct=5734.463] THEY HAVE ALL THREE.

[ct=5778.752] MINUTES TO MAKE IT A TWO SCORE
[ct=5795.324] 169 YARDS FOR SWIFT.

[ct=5814.124] KIND OF NIGHT.
[ct=5815.837] HOW GREAT IS THAT RUN?
[ct=5820.863] IT SHOWS WHAT HE HAS DONE ALL
[ct=5824.633] THAT PLAY IS DESIGNED TO GO
[ct=5827.122] BEHIND JASON KELSEY.
[ct=5828.382] THIS KID IS SHOWING YOU THE
[ct=5830.128] VISION AND PATIENCE HE HAS.
[ct=5833.129] HE IS NOT JUST A GUY THAT WILL
[ct=5833.860] CATCH THE BALL IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=5837.085] HE IS SHOWING YOU DIFFERENT
[ct=5837.085] WAYS.
[ct=5839.392] HE HAS HAD A HECKUVA NIGHT.
[ct=5840.568] GOOD FOR HIM.
[ct=5847.831] AL: OK.
[ct=5856.717] ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

[ct=5879.575] KIRK: YOU ARE IN GOOD HANDS.
[ct=5882.189] AL: THAT IS DROPPED.
[ct=5886.405] THAT CREATED SUCH CONSTERNATION
[ct=5886.899] IN BOSTON.
[ct=5890.474] TOM BRADY SAID, I HAVE THIS
[ct=5893.614] YOUNG GUY IN LOS ANGELES AND I'M

[ct=5909.461] INFORMATION.
[ct=5912.392] WE ARE ALL PULLING FOR AARON
[ct=5912.392] RODGERS.
[ct=5915.611] WE CANNOT WAIT TO SEE HIM FIGHT
[ct=5916.966] BACK TO GET READY FOR NEXT YEAR.
[ct=5918.377] WHAT A CATCH.
[ct=5923.438] AL: TAKING IT AWAY FROM SLAY
[ct=5925.074] WHO CAN HARDLY BELIEVE HE GAVE
[ct=5926.644] UP THE COMPLETION.

[ct=5939.851] AL: COUSINS, A SHOULDER SHAKE.
[ct=5944.133] MATTISON MAKES THE CATCH.
[ct=5949.044] HE STAYS IN.
[ct=5951.550] IT WOULD HELP IF HE GOT OUT OF

[ct=5963.887] OFFENSE, NUMBER 75.

[ct=5966.707] REPLAY FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5970.878] KIRK: THIS OFFENSIVE LINE HAS
[ct=5974.772] HAD ITS HANDS FIRST -- HANDS
[ct=5975.253] FULL ON THE RIGHT.
[ct=5980.046] FIRST TIME WE HAVE HAD A CHANCE
[ct=5982.217] TO CALL HIS NAME, GRAHAM.
[ct=5984.430] DID HE LIGHT OF THE ROOM WHEN HE
[ct=5985.827] WALKED INTO THE PRODUCTION
[ct=5986.356] MEETING YESTERDAY AFTERNOON?
[ct=5988.307] AL: ALWAYS DOES.
[ct=5991.521] KIRK: HE TOLD A GREAT STORY
[ct=5993.650] ABOUT THE ACHILLES INJURY HE HAD
[ct=5997.090] IN 2021.
[ct=5998.576] HIS FIGHT BACK AND HOW
[ct=6001.008] DETERMINED HE WAS TO BE A PART
[ct=6001.297] OF THIS FRANCHISE AND HOW
[ct=6004.544] GRATEFUL HE IS TO BE A P
[ct=6005.050] THIS.
[ct=6008.027] AL: ON THE FIRST AND 20.
[ct=6011.833] TY CHANDLER.
[ct=6014.833] SECOND AND LONG.
[ct=6015.650] ZACH CUNNINGHAM IN ON THE

[ct=6025.149] YOU HAD THE STRIP SACK OF TOM
[ct=6026.959] BRADY FROM GRAHAM TO CEMENT THE
[ct=6029.472] GAME LATE.
[ct=6031.390] THERE IS A STATUE OUTSIDE THE
[ct=6031.650] STADIUM.
[ct=6038.234] KIRK: HE APPRECIATED YOU TALKING
[ct=6038.468] ABOUT THAT.
[ct=6041.833] AL: COUSINS THROWS INTO THE
[ct=6046.066] HANDS OF MATTISON, THIRD AND 15.
[ct=6048.953] KIRK: BIG DROP.
[ct=6052.266] FLETCHER COX STILL PLAYING.
[ct=6052.909] SPEAKING OF VETERANS.
[ct=6056.757] THAT IS WHAT MAKES THIS
[ct=6057.375] PHILADELPHIA TEAM SO DANGEROUS.
[ct=6059.375] THE BALL GOES THROUGH HIS HANDS.
[ct=6063.717] YOU HAVE THESE VETERANS WITH SO
[ct=6063.959] MANY YOUNG PLAYERS.
[ct=6067.704] LIKE JALEN CARTER.
[ct=6085.354] CAUGHT AT THE 35 YARD LINE.
[ct=6091.650] THREE YARDS SHY OF THE FIRST
[ct=6093.985] DOWN IS TJ HOCKENSON.
[ct=6098.466] VIKINGS UP TO THE LINE OF
[ct=6099.902] SCRIMMAGE AND COUSINS IS TRYING
[ct=6100.168] TO GET THE PLAY CALLED.
[ct=6107.943] THEY STILL HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS
[ct=6109.454] PLUS THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=6112.369] THEY WILL HAVE TO CONVERT HERE,
[ct=6118.028] HE GOES TO THE TIGHT END,
[ct=6120.228] HOCKENSON TO KEEP IT GOING.
[ct=6123.234] MORROW MAKES THE STOP.
[ct=6128.179] KIRK: COUSINS TRYING TO GET THE
[ct=6129.217] SNAP OFF BEFORE THE TWO-MINUTE
[ct=6129.869] WARNING AND GET AN EXTRA
[ct=6134.144] AL: 3, 2, HE GETS IT OFF.
[ct=6140.908] MATTISON, NICE MOVE TO THE 30
[ct=6142.370] YARD LINE AND THAT IS WHERE THEY
[ct=6148.405] WILL PICK UPKIRK: TUA'S PERFORMA
[ct=6149.779] AND THAT FIREPOWER.
[ct=6152.895] MAC JONES AND PHIL O'BRIEN.
[ct=6154.692] COMPETITIVE.
[ct=6157.701] I THINK MAC JONES WILL FIT WITH
[ct=6160.445] WHAT BILLY O'BRIEN WANTS TO DO.
[ct=6163.634] IT IS A FORGOTTEN TEAM IN THAT
[ct=6163.872] DIVISION.
[ct=6171.695] AL: LAST YEAR, MATT PATRICIA IS
[ct=6173.370] NOW HERE AT PHILADELPHIA AS A
[ct=6173.603] SPECIAL ASSISTANT.
[ct=6179.205] I'M SURE HE HAD A FEW WORDS OF
[ct=6180.069] WISDOM GOING INTO LAST WEEK'S
[ct=6184.096] KIRK: THAT WAS A HECK OF A
[ct=6184.163] HECKUVA GAME, ACTUALLY.
[ct=6186.611] AL: IT WAS.
[ct=6191.166] TWO TIME OUTS LEFT FOR
[ct=6191.166] MINNESOTA.
[ct=6196.451] KIRK: OFF TO HIS RIGHT.
[ct=6196.451] JUSTIN JEFFERSON.
[ct=6200.392] THE SAFETY OVER TOP TO HELP OUT,
[ct=6201.044] TO PROTECT.
[ct=6202.769] AL: FLAG.
[ct=6207.171] MATTISON LOOKS AND LOSES THE
[ct=6208.732] BALL AND THE EAGLES HAVE IT FOR
[ct=6209.277] THE MOMENT.
[ct=6213.599] PENDING THE CALL HERE, JUSTIN
[ct=6217.775] EVANS WINDS UP AT THE BOTTOM.
[ct=6219.790] THE FLAG IS DOWN AT THE LINE OF
[ct=6219.790] ABOUT.
[ct=6223.130] KIRK: I DON'T KNOW IF
[ct=6225.744] PHILADELPHIA LINED UP OFFSIDES.
[ct=6227.383] I THINK THAT MAY HAVE BEEN A
[ct=6229.575] AL: YEP.
[ct=6236.219] NO FUMBLE.
[ct=6243.463] >> OFFSIDE, DEFENSE.
[ct=6245.251] NUMBER 97 LINING UP IN THE
[ct=6245.665] NEUTRAL ZONE.
[ct=6250.764] AL: TALKING ABOUT GUYS LINING UP
[ct=6250.764] IN THE NEUTRAL ZONE.
[ct=6254.306] MORE OF A POINT OF EMPHASIS THAN
[ct=6255.082] IT USED TO BE.
[ct=6257.739] >> THEY REALLY WANT THEM TO
[ct=6259.422] START THE PLAY LEGALLY.
[ct=6262.541] HE IS CLEARLY IN THE NEUTRAL
[ct=6266.078] I THINK THE RIGHT TACKLE IS BACK
[ct=6266.319] A LITTLE.
[ct=6268.139] MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE OFFSET
[ct=6268.658] THOSE.
[ct=6274.644] AL: A LITTLE YING AND YANG.
[ct=6278.767] COUSINS OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=6279.869] IT IS BROKEN UP AT THE TWO YARD
[ct=6283.788] AND TAKING A SHOT THERE WAS
[ct=6285.787] HOCKENSON WITH JUSTIN EVANS.
[ct=6289.366] KIRK: EVANS, A QUICK REACTION.
[ct=6292.577] IF YOU ARE A VIKINGS FAN YOU'RE
[ct=6294.797] WONDERING IF IT WAS TOO QUICK OF
[ct=6298.442] AN ACTION TRYING TO HIT THE SEAM
[ct=6299.070] BETWEEN THE TWO SAFETIES.
[ct=6303.383] AL: HERE IS THE BANG BANG PLAY
[ct=6304.377] THAT TERRY WAS TALKING ABOUT
[ct=6304.771] FROM BEFORE.
[ct=6308.069] KIRK: TERRY IS GIVING IT A
[ct=6309.917] THUMBS UP AND IT IS CLEAN.
[ct=6309.917] OK.
[ct=6314.200] AL: SECOND DOWN AND FIVE.
[ct=6316.982] COUSINS, A SHOULDER SHAKE.
[ct=6317.510] HE THROWS.
[ct=6322.097] JEFFERSON, FIRST DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=6326.706] RACING TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE
[ct=6328.156] SAVING THEIR TIMEOUTS AND THE
[ct=6329.087] CLOCK IS UNDER A MINUTE AND A
[ct=6333.772] KIRK: IT WAS NOT PLAYING MAN.
[ct=6335.685] COUSINS HAD TO PUT IT ON A ROPE
[ct=6339.782] AND HE GETS IT OVER SLAY AND IN
[ct=6340.017] FRONT OF THE SAFETY.
[ct=6343.099] AL: BLITZ,.
[ct=6344.659] INTO THE END ZONE FOR THE
[ct=6348.652] TJ HOCKENSON.
[ct=6351.110] WHAT A DRIVE CONVERTED A FOURTH
[ct=6353.379] DOWN ALONG THE WAY AND GOES 75
[ct=6359.660] KIRK: THIS GAME MAY END AND
[ct=6361.947] PHILLY MAY WIN BUT IF I AM A
[ct=6362.740] VIKINGS FAN, YOU MAY BE
[ct=6364.887] DISAPPOINTED POTENTIALLY IF THEY
[ct=6368.507] LOSE THE GAME BUT I LOVE THEIR
[ct=6371.505] FIGHTING ALL THE WAY TO THE END
[ct=6372.824] TRYING TO DO ANYTHING THEY CAN
[ct=6373.403] TO GET BACK INTO THE GAME.
[ct=6377.575] AL: AND TRYING TO WITHSTAND FOUR
[ct=6377.828] TURNOVERS TONIGHT.
[ct=6379.251] JOSEPH.
[ct=6381.921] WE HAVE A SIX-POINT GAME.
[ct=6385.473] YOU LINE AND LET'S FACE IT
[ct=6387.361] COUSINS IS ON HIS THIRD LEFT
[ct=6389.404] HE IS SHOWING HIS LEADERSHIP.
[ct=6399.149] AL: HOW RARE AND ONSIDE KICK IS
[ct=6400.652] AND HOW RARE IT IS FOR THE
[ct=6401.904] KICKING TEAM TO RECOVER THAT
[ct=6402.503] ONSIDE KICK.
[ct=6405.991] IN A WAY YOU HAVE TO DO IT
[ct=6406.760] BECAUSE OF THE TWO TIMEOUTS.
[ct=6410.698] BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO GIVE UP
[ct=6412.479] ALMOST 40 SECONDS ON THE PLAY
[ct=6413.549] CLOCK AT SOME POINT.
[ct=6417.082] YOU COULD CALL TWO QUICK
[ct=6419.715] TIMEOUTS AND RUN IT DOWN TO 20
[ct=6421.007] SECONDS OR LESS.
[ct=6433.542] AL: PHILADELPHIA WANTED TO SEE
[ct=6435.916] WHAT THE ALIGNMENT WAS WITH THE
[ct=6435.916] TIMEOUT.
[ct=6440.138] KIRK: MAYBE THIS IS COMMON WITH
[ct=6441.125] KICKERS.
[ct=6442.462] THEY SEE A TEE.
[ct=6446.307] IT IS PROPPED UP UNUSUALLY FOR
[ct=6449.554] AN ONSIDE KICK.
[ct=6450.779] I KNOW YOU ARE A SCRATCH GOLFER.
[ct=6454.450] IT IS LIKE GOING BACK TO THE
[ct=6454.791] GOLF GAME.
[ct=6458.664] AL: THESE DAYS I AM A HEALTHY
[ct=6458.664] SCRATCH.
[ct=6460.428] WHAT CAN I TELL YOU.
[ct=6464.874] KIRK: HONESTLY, HOW MANY DAYS OF
[ct=6465.766] GOLF DO YOU PLAY?
[ct=6468.301] AL: THESE DAYS?
[ct=6471.455] LIKE YOU, I'M WORKING TOO HARD.
[ct=6475.450] I'M NOT DOING 1800 GAMES.
[ct=6478.289] BUT ANYWAY, LET'S SEE WHAT
[ct=6480.302] HAPPENS AND WHICH WAY HE WILL GO
[ct=6482.257] WITH THE KICK.
[ct=6484.029] THE NEW RULES ARE THAT YOU HAVE
[ct=6487.302] TO LINED UP AN EVEN NUMBER OF
[ct=6487.302] GUYS ON BOTH SIDE.
[ct=6489.853] FIVE ON HIS LEFT AND FIVE ON HIS
[ct=6490.148] RIGHT.
[ct=6493.387] THE EAGLES HAVE SIX GUYS AT THE
[ct=6493.862] 45 YARD LINE.
[ct=6496.369] NINE IN YOUR PICTURE RIGHT
[ct=6499.478] JOSEPH COMES FORWARD WITH A HOP
[ct=6501.750] AND A SKIP.
[ct=6502.999] HE IS COVERED BY THE EAGLES AT
[ct=6503.693] THE 49 YARD LINE.
[ct=6506.642] THAT IS DEVONTA SMITH.
[ct=6511.802] YOU PUT THE GOOD HANDS PLAYER --
[ct=6513.130] THE GOOD HANDS PEOPLE OUT ON
[ct=6513.370] THAT PLAY.
[ct=6516.170] KIRK: USUALLY YOU WAIT FOR THE
[ct=6518.827] THIRD BOUNCE AND IT POPS UP INTO
[ct=6520.713] THE AIR.
[ct=6523.980] THAT WAS MORE OF A TRYING TO USE
[ct=6525.816] THE SPIN TO MAKE THE BALL TAKE
[ct=6527.573] AN UNUSUAL BOUNCE.
[ct=6529.165] IT DOES NOT WORK OUT.
[ct=6534.544] AL: SO HERE NOW THE VIKINGS CAN
[ct=6536.470] TAKE THEIR TWO TIMEOUTS BUT BY
[ct=6537.783] THE TIME THEY GET THE BALL BACK,
[ct=6542.165] PHILLY HAS TO GIVE IT UP WITH
[ct=6543.226] ALMOST NO TIME LEFT ON THE
[ct=6543.226] CLOCK.
[ct=6547.210] AT THAT POINT, THE FORMATION --
[ct=6550.310] SWIFT TAKES IT.
[ct=6550.861] A HUGE NIGHT.
[ct=6553.498] HIS HUGE NIGHT CONTINUES.
[ct=6556.278] 173 ON THE GROUND.
[ct=6558.607] IT FEEL
[ct=6563.502] LIKE THEY ARE PLAYING C+ TURNOVE
[ct=6564.363] FOUR TONIGHT.
[ct=6567.505] AL: THIRD AND SIX.
[ct=6572.866] THEY CANNOT STOP THE CLOCK.
[ct=6574.381] THE VIKINGS CANNOT.
[ct=6574.381] FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=6579.967] YOU CAN TAKE THE PLAY CLOCK DOWN
[ct=6581.135] TO ABOUT 15 SECONDS.
[ct=6584.508] AND LEAVE THE VIKINGS WITH NEXT
[ct=6585.044] TO NOTHING.
[ct=6591.302] I WILL SAY ONE THING -- I WANTED
[ct=6593.256] TO MENTION THIS EARLIER WITH
[ct=6595.892] HE HAS THE ALBATROSS ON HIS NECK
[ct=6598.731] , CANNOT WIN IN PRIME TIME.
[ct=6601.710] IF YOU SAW THE QUARTERBACK
[ct=6604.164] SERIES, IF YOU DON'T KNOW HIM
[ct=6606.042] YOU HAD TO COME AWAY ADMIRING
[ct=6606.830] AND LIKING THE GUY.
[ct=6611.086] HE AND PATRICK MAHOMES AND MARY
[ct=6613.371] YADA -- MARY
[ct=6617.133] YADA -- MARIOTTA DID THAT.
[ct=6622.651] >> FALSE START, OFFENSE, NUMBER
[ct=6623.212] 88.
[ct=6624.490] FIVE YARD PENALTY, FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=6628.764] KIRK: BECAUSE OF WHAT COUSINS
[ct=6629.208] GOES THROUGH IT HIS AGE AND HE
[ct=6632.232] WAS HIT MORE THAN ANY
[ct=6634.099] QUARTERBACK LAST YEAR, YOU CAN
[ct=6635.665] SEE HOW HE PUTS HIMSELF BACK
[ct=6637.468] TOGETHER AND IT IS PRETTY
[ct=6638.091] REMARKABLE.
[ct=6644.504] YOU SEE GOATHERD -- YOU SEE
[ct=6649.765] GOEDERT AND THEY PUNT THE
[ct=6650.011] FOOTBALL RIGHT AT MIDFIELD.
[ct=6653.262] AL: LOOKS OVER TOWARD THE BENCH
[ct=6655.654] -- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO
[ct=6656.117] WITH THIS?
[ct=6658.208] TAKE IT OUT OF BOUNDS?
[ct=6662.304] POOCH PUNT IT?
[ct=6667.490] THE EAGLES DON’
[ct=6667.986] THE EAGLES DON'T WANT THIS GAME
[ct=6676.726] TO END THE WAY A PREVIOUS GAME
[ct=6676.987] DID WHEN IT WENT TO OVERTIME.
[ct=6681.012] EVERYONE LOOKING AROUND GOING --
[ct=6685.195] >> MINNESOTA DID DECLINE THE 10
[ct=6685.604] SECOND RUNOFF.
[ct=6694.953] AL: YOU ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO
[ct=6698.292] ROLL OUT THAT 10 SECOND RUNOFF
[ct=6698.940] IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION.
[ct=6704.727] BRANDON POWELL IS BACK TO GET AN
[ct=6705.832] OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING WITH
[ct=6708.370] HE WILL.
[ct=6713.620] AND HE CANNOT GO VERY FAR.
[ct=6715.812] TACKLED AT THE 17 WITH SEVEN
[ct=6718.620] RINGO MAKES THE TACKLE.
[ct=6722.445] ONE DESPERATE PRAYER.
[ct=6725.543] WHICH THEY HAD ANSWERED WHEN
[ct=6727.243] THEY PLAYED IN BUFFALO LAST
[ct=6727.991] REMEMBER THAT GAME?
[ct=6732.179] KIRK: YOU KNOW JUSTIN JEFFERSON
[ct=6734.673] WILL GET ALL OF THE ATTENTION OF
[ct=6738.829] THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PLAYS WHERE
[ct=6739.671] YOU ARE SETTING UP THE DIFFERENT
[ct=6743.317] LAT RULES TO KEEP THE PL
[ct=6743.721] ALIVE.
[ct=6748.694] AL: THEY WILL ACTIVATE CASE CADE
[ct=6749.940] HIM FROM THE MINNESOTA MIRACLE
[ct=6753.798] LIKELY THE FINAL PLAY OF THE
[ct=6758.374] GAME BARRING A DEFENSE OF FOUL.
[ct=6758.958] BUT BEFORE THAT --
[ct=6762.860] >> TIMEOUT, PHILADELPHIA.
[ct=6765.671] AL: THIS IS LIKE THE NBA.
[ct=6769.906] THE LAST TWO MINUTES IS LIKE A
[ct=6770.357] HALF HOUR.
[ct=6787.261] [WHISTLES]
