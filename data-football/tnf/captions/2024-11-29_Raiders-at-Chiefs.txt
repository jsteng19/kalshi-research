[ct=4.976] FULL HOUSE AS ALWAYS,
[ct=4.976] AND WE ARE READY TO GO
[ct=8.080] AS WE BEGIN WEEK 13 OF
[ct=9.212] THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL
[ct=10.437] LEAGUE SEASON, WHICH
[ct=11.848] ACTUALLY STARTED LAST
[ct=12.772] NIGHT AND YESTERDAY
[ct=13.382] AFTERNOON WITH THREE
[ct=13.838] GAMES.
[ct=15.974] AND AWAY WE GO WITH
[ct=18.629] GAME NUMBER 4 OF THIS
[ct=20.238] WEEK.
[ct=22.127] CARLSON TO KICK OFF
[ct=22.939] FOR LAS VEGAS.
[ct=24.785] THEY WON THE TOSS, AND
[ct=26.092] THEY HAVE DEFERRED.
[ct=27.555] WANT TO RESET THE PLAY
[ct=29.171] CLOCK, AND AS THEY SAY
[ct=31.453] A VERY LIGHT BREEZE
[ct=33.606] BUT ENOUGH TO BLOW THE
[ct=34.416] BALL OFF THE TEE TO
[ct=39.366] GET STARTED.
[ct=41.000] NICOLE HARDMAN AND
[ct=46.947] SIMONTE ARE BACK TO
[ct=47.892] RECEIVE FOR KANSAS
[ct=48.909] CITY.
[ct=50.803] CARLSON GETS A 10-YARD
[ct=51.447] RUNNING START AND
[ct=52.352] SENDS THE BALL TO THE
[ct=55.007] CORNER OF THE END
[ct=56.645] ZONE.
[ct=58.385] IT’LL BE TAKEN BACK
[ct=59.252] FROM THE GOAL LINE.
[ct=60.253] AND HE WORKS HIS WAY
[ct=62.487] UP TO THE 28 YARD
[ct=62.699] LINE.
[ct=63.924] SO THEY DEFER, WHICH
[ct=64.930] MEANS THEY FACE
[ct=66.164] PATRICK MAHOMES RIGHT
[ct=68.741] OFF THE BAT.
[ct=69.978] PATRICK HAS HAD BETTER
[ct=71.115] SEASONS.
[ct=71.301] HE’S THE FIRST TO SAY
[ct=72.534] IT.
[ct=72.793] BUT WHEN WE TALKED TO
[ct=74.377] HIM THE OTHER DAY HE
[ct=74.992] SAID, HEY, JUST
[ct=76.246] FINDING A WAY TO WIN.
[ct=78.451] THAT INDEED HE’S DONE.
[ct=78.451] HE’S BEEN MUCH BETTER
[ct=79.588] OVER THE LAST FEW
[ct=83.915] GAMES THAN HE WAS URLT
[ct=85.298] EARLY ON.
[ct=86.431] KAREEM HUNT GETS THE
[ct=90.460] BACK HEELED.
[ct=93.310] ISIAH PACHECO HAS BEEN
[ct=94.339] VERY ACTIVE.
[ct=95.241] THE RAIDERS ARE EQUAL
[ct=96.394] TO THAT TASK.
[ct=97.979] IT’LL BE SECOND DOWN.
[ct=99.893] ADAM BUTLER ON THE
[ct=99.893] STOP.
[ct=102.532] >> Kirk: A BIG FOCUS
[ct=103.291] FOR ANYBODY GOING UP
[ct=104.379] AGAINST PATRICK
[ct=105.825] MAHOMES, TRY TO NEGATE
[ct=106.438] THIS RUN GAME.
[ct=107.991] THE CHIEFS LEAD THE
[ct=108.344] NFL IN THIRD DOWN
[ct=109.385] EFFICIENCY, SO YOU
[ct=110.337] WANT TO TRY AND GET
[ct=113.415] HIM BEHIND THE STICKS.
[ct=113.415] GOOD JOB THERE
[ct=114.352] STOPPING THAT RUN GAME
[ct=117.430] AND HUNT HERE EARLY.
[ct=126.777] >> Al: HIS FIRST PASS
[ct=130.670] OF THE THE GAME.
[ct=131.802] OPEN AND ISAIAH
[ct=134.226] WORTHY, ROOKIE OUT OF
[ct=135.135] TEXAS.
[ct=136.172] THEIR FIRST DRAFT
[ct=136.697] CHOICE.
[ct=137.197] WORTHY IS GOOD THERE
[ct=138.379] AT THE FIRST DOWN AT
[ct=139.795] THE 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=141.780] CONDENSED FORMATION.
[ct=144.289] GIVES HIM PLENTY OF
[ct=144.289] ROOM TO THE WORK TO
[ct=145.359] THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=146.055] RAIDERS DROP BACK IN
[ct=146.863] SOFT COVERAGE AND
[ct=148.897] PATRICK MAHOMES AS
[ct=151.097] GOOD AS HE IS SEEING
[ct=152.190] THAT PRE- AND
[ct=154.819] POST-SNAP MOMENT.
[ct=155.697] >> Al: GAIN OF 14.
[ct=157.927] GOOD DROP, GOOD
[ct=159.131] PROTECTION, GOING DEEP
[ct=160.062] DOWNFIELD, AND A
[ct=160.677] LITTLE TOO DEEP FOR
[ct=162.854] JUSTIN WATSON.
[ct=165.142] THEY HAVE A PLETHORA
[ct=166.161] OF -- OF WIDE
[ct=168.805] RECEIVERS, EVEN MINUS
[ct=169.628] HOLLYWOOD BROWN AND
[ct=177.137] EVEN MINUS RASHEED
[ct=179.450] RICE WHO GOT EARLY ON
[ct=181.228] AND THEY PICKED UP
[ct=182.841] HOPKINS.
[ct=185.268] >> Kirk: PLAYING 1st
[ct=187.831] AND 10, NOT USED TO
[ct=188.293] SEEING THAT.
[ct=189.193] PATRICK MAHOMES USED
[ct=189.965] TO SEEING SHELL
[ct=191.248] COVERAGE, MEANING A
[ct=192.534] LOT OF COVERAGE TOO IN
[ct=194.051] FRONT OF HIM.
[ct=194.835] >> Al: KEEPING THE
[ct=196.137] BALL DOWN ON THE LEFT
[ct=197.877] SIDE.
[ct=198.087] KAREEM HUNT UP TO THE
[ct=199.480] 44 YARD LINE.
[ct=200.483] THEY PICKED UP HUNT
[ct=201.407] WHO’D BEEN WITH
[ct=201.901] CLEVELAND OVER THE
[ct=202.993] PAST FIVE YEARS WHEN
[ct=204.456] PACHECO GOT HURT.
[ct=205.928] NOW PACHECO IS BACK
[ct=206.683] TODAY, AND WE’LL GET
[ct=207.324] AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE
[ct=208.385] HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME
[ct=209.497] IN TWO MONTHS.
[ct=210.376] >> Kirk: YEAH, IT’S A
[ct=211.567] VERY DIFFERENT OFFENSE
[ct=212.149] WITHOUT WHAT HE
[ct=213.212] BRINGS, THAT EXPLOSIVE
[ct=214.290] NATURE OF HIS RUNNING
[ct=215.182] GAME AND WHAT HE CAN
[ct=216.074] DO.
[ct=217.439] AND I THINK IT
[ct=218.919] ELECTRIFIES THE
[ct=219.478] OFFENSE WILL
[ct=220.132] EVENTUALLY GET A LOOK
[ct=220.653] AT HIM.
[ct=221.862] THESE GUYS, AGAIN,
[ct=223.040] LEAD THE ENTIRE NFL IN
[ct=224.244] THIRD DOWN EFFICIENCY.
[ct=225.412] SEE HOW THEY DO HERE.
[ct=226.786] >> HERE THEY ARE ON A
[ct=229.637] 3rd DOWN AND 8.
[ct=230.782] MAHOMES STEPPING UP,
[ct=232.139] UNDER PRESSURE.
[ct=233.737] THROWS UNDER PRESSURE.
[ct=234.798] COMPLETES IT.
[ct=236.639] TRAVIS KELCE TO THE 45
[ct=237.380] YARD LINE.
[ct=238.512] HE GOES, BUT THERE’S A
[ct=239.041] FLAG DOWN.
[ct=239.894] A LOT OF ACTION UP
[ct=240.985] FRONT AT THE
[ct=242.084] INCEPTION.
[ct=243.168] >> Kirk: YEAH, HE HAD
[ct=249.978] A FREE PLAY THERE.
[ct=249.978] CHAISSON JUMPED TO HIS
[ct=251.333] LEFT.
[ct=252.432] RECOGNIZED HE HAD THAT
[ct=253.500] FREE PLAY AND DIALS UP
[ct=254.685] HIS MAIN TARGET FOR
[ct=259.920] THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=260.723] >> Al: CLAY MARTIN,
[ct=263.884] OUR REFEREE TODAY.
[ct=264.497] >> Kirk: WATCH KELCE’S
[ct=266.563] ROUTE.
[ct=266.759] BY THE WAY, HE JUMPED
[ct=267.852] THERE.
[ct=269.221] NOW HE’S JUST PLAYING
[ct=271.529] BACKYARD FOOTBALL.
[ct=271.974] THAT’S NOT EVEN A
[ct=273.155] THAT’S JUST FEELING
[ct=273.849] WITH THE OPENING SPACE
[ct=276.511] IS AND MAHOMES BEING
[ct=279.127] ON TARGET.
[ct=279.384] >> Al: NOW PACHECO.
[ct=279.753] AND THE CROWD
[ct=281.229] RESPONDING, GAVE HIM A
[ct=284.534] GREAT OVATION WHEN HE
[ct=284.534] WAS INTRODUCED BEFORE
[ct=284.968] THE GAME.
[ct=285.924] AND YOU CAN HEAR THE
[ct=288.362] CHEERS RESOUNDING TO
[ct=289.764] THE RETURN OF NUMBER
[ct=289.988] 10.
[ct=293.074] BRINGS SUCH ENERGY.
[ct=294.642] YOU CAN FEEL NOT JUST
[ct=295.064] THE CROWD -- HE’S
[ct=295.881] GOING TO CHECK OUT.
[ct=297.105] NOT JUST THE CROWD,
[ct=298.309] MORE IMPORTANTLY ON
[ct=299.394] THE FIELD.
[ct=300.006] TEAMS, AGAIN, THEY
[ct=301.249] PLAY A LOT OF COVERAGE
[ct=301.894] MEANING THEY WANT TO
[ct=302.841] KEEP EVERYTHING IN
[ct=303.360] FRONT OF THE DEFENSE.
[ct=304.199] THEY DON’T WANT TO
[ct=305.276] GIVE MAHOMES A CHANCE
[ct=307.680] TO LET THESE RECEIVERS
[ct=309.964] GET BEHIND HIM, AND
[ct=310.169] THAT’S WHERE THEY’VE
[ct=312.191] MISSED PACHECO, MAKING
[ct=312.371] DEFENSE PAY FOR THAT
[ct=313.824] APPROACH.
[ct=315.411] >> Al: 2nd DOWN AND 6.
[ct=316.588] FAKE TOSS AND A LITTLE
[ct=319.165] SHOVEL PASS TO KAREEM
[ct=320.760] HUNT WHO’S BACK IN
[ct=321.896] PACHECO IN FOR
[ct=323.175] PLAY.
[ct=324.556] FRACTURES FIBULA IN
[ct=325.412] WEEK 2 AGAINST
[ct=326.512] CINCINNATI.
[ct=326.692] THEY’VE HAD THEIR
[ct=327.796] SHARE OF INJURY.
[ct=328.285] OF COURSE EVERY OTHER
[ct=331.787] TEAM IN THE LEAGUE
[ct=333.270] SAYS EXCUSE US.
[ct=334.961] >> Kirk: EXACTLY.
[ct=338.435] ANDY REID PUTS XAVIER
[ct=340.452] NEXT TO MAHOMES AND
[ct=343.367] LINES HIM UP AND GIVES
[ct=343.821] HIM THAT SHOVEL PASS.
[ct=344.824] >> Al: NOW YOU’VE GOT
[ct=346.099] PACHECO LINED UP HERE.
[ct=347.302] IN THE BACK FIELD,
[ct=349.761] TAKES THE HAND-OFF,
[ct=350.577] SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH.
[ct=356.666] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=360.754] COLLISION WITH THE
[ct=362.500] LINEBACKER.
[ct=363.409] AND THAT WAS A
[ct=364.478] COLLISION.
[ct=365.299] RIGHT HERE HE’S GOING
[ct=368.526] TO GET DOWNHILL AND
[ct=369.280] TRY TO KEEP HIM SHORT
[ct=370.029] AGAINST THAT DIAMOND
[ct=372.100] FORMATION.
[ct=372.566] BANG, HITS HIM RIGHT
[ct=373.383] AT THE LINE AND JUST
[ct=376.053] ENOUGH FOR THE FIRST
[ct=377.030] DOWN.
[ct=378.663] >> Al: SPILLANE HAVING
[ct=380.153] AN OUTSTANDING SEASON.
[ct=382.481] PACHECO IS THE RUNNING
[ct=383.806] BACK.
[ct=385.154] PLAY ACTION.
[ct=386.252] SWINGS IT SHORT,
[ct=389.127] INCOMPLETE.
[ct=390.459] 2nd DOWN AND 10.
[ct=390.915] LET’S GO DOWN TO
[ct=391.806] KAYLEE.
[ct=395.743] >> GUYS, I’M TOLD WHEN
[ct=400.595] ISIAH PACHECO ARRIVED
[ct=400.595] TONIGHT HE HAD A FIRE
[ct=402.906] IN HIS EYES.
[ct=403.557] THAT MADE NINE GAMES
[ct=406.172] HE MISSED.
[ct=406.172] IT TOOK A TITANIUM
[ct=408.043] PLATE AND SEVEN SCREWS
[ct=408.796] TO STABILIZE THE BONE
[ct=410.711] IN HIS LOWER SHIN.
[ct=412.303] HE RETURNED LAST WEEK,
[ct=413.632] BUT THEY HELD HIM BACK
[ct=416.260] BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW
[ct=416.514] HARD HE PLAYS.
[ct=417.895] >> Al: SO HERE HE IS
[ct=419.177] STAYING IN.
[ct=421.357] 2nd AND 10, 4 MINUTES
[ct=422.319] INTO THE GAME.
[ct=423.151] CHIEFS ON THE MOVE.
[ct=424.536] DEEP DOWNFIELD.
[ct=426.015] ONE-ON-ONE THERE.
[ct=428.850] ONE-HANDED CATCH NOT
[ct=429.967] MADE BY HOPKINS.
[ct=430.723] ALMOST HAD THE
[ct=431.661] OPPORTUNITY, BUT
[ct=432.731] YOU’VE GOT A FLAG AT
[ct=435.498] THE END OF THE PLAY,
[ct=436.783] SO MAHOMES HAS ALREADY
[ct=438.604] DAIKON HIS TEAM
[ct=442.109] IT’LL BE PASS
[ct=442.566] INTERFERENCE ON JACK
[ct=443.495] JONES.
[ct=444.751] >> Referee: PASS
[ct=445.686] INTERFERENCE DEFENSE
[ct=446.806] NUMBER 18.
[ct=448.173] AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
[ct=448.997] >> Kirk: AGAIN, YOU’RE
[ct=449.875] JUST NOT USED TO
[ct=450.917] SEEING PEOPLE
[ct=451.898] CHALLENGE MAHOMES AND
[ct=452.871] HIS RECEIVERS.
[ct=453.584] I’M SURE HE’S
[ct=454.935] WELCOMING IT.
[ct=456.295] SHOWS YOU THE
[ct=456.295] CONFIDENCE RAIDERS
[ct=456.752] HAVE IN JONES AND
[ct=457.869] OTHERS TO HANG OUT ON
[ct=460.482] THESE ISLANDS.
[ct=461.839] HE DOES A PRETTY GOOD
[ct=462.567] JOB STAYING STEP FOR
[ct=463.414] STEP THERE.
[ct=464.757] HE’S IN PHASE, BUT THE
[ct=465.773] HANDS GOT A LITTLE BIT
[ct=466.543] INVOLVED THERE, AND
[ct=467.464] THE FACT HE’S NOT
[ct=468.354] LOOKING BACK TO FIND
[ct=470.606] THE FOOTBALL PROBABLY
[ct=472.553] IS WHAT DREW THE FOUL.
[ct=472.553] >> Al: ALMOST CAUGHT
[ct=473.933] IT AS WELL.
[ct=474.523] THERE’S AIDAN
[ct=476.352] O’CONNELL AWAITING HIS
[ct=477.909] TURN.
[ct=478.886] BUT THE BALL AT THE 13
[ct=480.304] QUICK PASS, KELCE
[ct=481.479] MAKES THE GRAB.
[ct=482.779] KELCE TO THE 7 YARD
[ct=486.314] STOPPED THERE BY
[ct=488.404] ISAIAH POLA-MAO.
[ct=490.096] INTERESTING THEY SIT
[ct=491.822] BACK DOWN IN THIS RED
[ct=494.009] AREA WHERE MAHOMES IS
[ct=494.875] ALWAYS LOOKING TO FIND
[ct=495.788] HIS TIGHT ENDS, OF
[ct=496.718] COURSE KELCE.
[ct=498.100] BUT THEY HAD REALLY
[ct=499.138] SOFT COVERAGE, MADE IT
[ct=501.590] SIMPLE FOR MAHOMES TO
[ct=502.477] ABORT ANYBODY ELSE AND
[ct=504.364] IMMEDIATELY GET THE
[ct=506.872] BALL TO TRAVIS KELCE.
[ct=508.218] >> Al: HAVE ALREADY
[ct=508.634] RUN 11 PLAYS.
[ct=510.847] WHEN YOU WIN THE TOSS,
[ct=512.558] WHAT DO YOU DO?
[ct=513.298] YOU DEFER AND LOOK
[ct=514.371] WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU.
[ct=515.543] GOT TO STOP THEM ON
[ct=516.397] THEIR 12th PLAY HERE
[ct=521.012] ON A 2 PD DOWN AND 4.
[ct=521.012] MAHOMES ROLLING AND
[ct=521.978] SPINNING AND TWIRLING
[ct=522.264] AND THE PASS
[ct=524.234] ININCOMPLETE, INTENDED
[ct=524.234] FOR HUNT.
[ct=525.557] 3rd DOWN AND 4.
[ct=526.461] >> Kirk: YEAH, THAT’S
[ct=527.947] THE ONE AREA THAT
[ct=528.422] OBVIOUSLY MAHOMES AND
[ct=529.346] THE CHIEFS, THE
[ct=530.669] BIGGEST CONCERN THEY
[ct=531.285] HAVE IS GIVING HIM
[ct=532.229] ENOUGH TIME.
[ct=533.589] USUALLY IT COMES OFF
[ct=534.232] THE EDGES TODAY
[ct=535.346] AGAINST MAXX CROSBY.
[ct=536.150] THAT’LL BE A GREAT
[ct=538.550] MATCHUP TO SEE IF THEY
[ct=538.769] CAN PROTECT HIM
[ct=539.828] ESPECIALLY IN OBVIOUS
[ct=540.698] PASSING SITUATIONS.
[ct=541.161] THAT TIME IT WAS JUST
[ct=542.657] A GOOD PUSH IN THE
[ct=549.457] INTERIOR THAT TIME.
[ct=556.309] >> Al: PLAYED IN THE
[ct=558.594] SUPER BOWL AGAINST THE
[ct=559.745] RAMS THREE YEARS AGO.
[ct=561.488] SEND HIM IN MOTION.
[ct=562.590] MAHOMES FIRES, AND
[ct=565.122] THAT’S CHIPPED AND
[ct=565.580] TRY TO GET IT TO TO
[ct=566.473] HOPKINS, COVER THERE
[ct=567.243] BY JACK JONES AND
[ct=568.398] THEY’LL HAVE TO SETTLE
[ct=569.325] FOR A FIELD GOAL
[ct=570.802] ATTEMPT WITH A BRAND
[ct=573.570] NEW FIELD GOAL KICKER
[ct=576.001] BECAUSE HARRISON
[ct=576.251] BUTKER IS HURT BACK IN
[ct=578.181] A COUPLE OF WEEKS.
[ct=579.149] TRADER KICKED LAST
[ct=580.395] WEEK BUT HE’S HURT
[ct=581.186] NOW.
[ct=583.674] INSIDE LEVERAGE?
[ct=584.420] HE TOOK AWAY THE
[ct=584.886] SLANT.
[ct=585.910] THAT’S JUST A GREAT
[ct=586.936] PLAY BY JONES TO RIGHT
[ct=587.732] BEFORE THE SNAP TAKE
[ct=589.459] ONE OR TWO STEPS
[ct=590.773] INSIDE ALMOST
[ct=591.341] ANTICIPATING THAT
[ct=591.588] QUICK SLANT.
[ct=592.866] AND HE TOOK THAT
[ct=593.812] LEVERAGE AWAY FROM
[ct=595.290] HE DIDN’T HAVE MUCH OF
[ct=597.570] A CHANCE THERE.
[ct=598.924] >> Al: HERE’S MATTHEW
[ct=598.924] WRIGHT, JUST SIGNED
[ct=600.228] HIM.
[ct=601.051] WE SAW HIM ON THURSDAY
[ct=602.174] NIGHT LARGEST
[ct=604.272] WOOD FIRE COOKERY IN
[ct=605.006] THE UNITED STATES.
[ct=605.665] YOU KNOW THAT?
[ct=607.381] >> Kirk: NO, I DIDN’T.
[ct=607.750] IF ROOM SERVICE
[ct=608.967] WEREN’T SO GOOD, WE
[ct=610.254] COULD HAVE HEADED OVER
[ct=612.171] >> Al: ROOM SERVICE
[ct=617.717] WHERE?
[ct=617.984] ANYWAY, ARROWHEAD
[ct=619.757] STADIUM.
[ct=620.228] >> Kirk: STARTING
[ct=621.829] EARLY HERE.
[ct=624.407] >> Al: SPARKLING DAY.
[ct=625.553] >> Kirk: PLUS HAD A
[ct=626.405] GREAT NIGHT.
[ct=628.348] >> Al: ABSOLUTELY.
[ct=628.348] KICK OFF BOUNDING
[ct=629.304] THROUGH THE END ZONE,
[ct=631.215] AND WE TAKE A LOOK AT
[ct=632.315] AIDAN O’CONNELL.
[ct=632.865] SO HE’S BACK.
[ct=637.126] HE LOST THE JOB TO
[ct=639.864] GARDNER MINSHEW EARLY
[ct=641.298] IN THE SEASON, AND
[ct=642.634] FRACTURED HIS THUMB,
[ct=644.312] AND MINSHEW IS OUT
[ct=645.184] HAVING BROKEN HIS
[ct=647.533] COLLAR BONE LAST WEEK.
[ct=648.766] >> Kirk: HAVING HIS
[ct=649.784] BACK I THINK IT’S BIG.
[ct=651.571] I THINK THIS TEAM
[ct=653.000] LOVES HIS APPROACH.
[ct=655.413] SHOWS UP, FIRST GUY
[ct=656.200] THERE, WORKS HARD.
[ct=657.014] HIS PREPARATION I
[ct=657.439] THINK HAS BURNED THE
[ct=657.982] RESPECT OF HIS
[ct=659.338] TEAMMATES.
[ct=659.363] THE BEST THING HE CAN
[ct=660.841] DO IS HE’S DECISIVE,
[ct=661.430] GETS THE BALL OUT
[ct=662.211] QUICKLY.
[ct=662.684] THEY WANT TO TRY TO
[ct=663.469] RUN THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=664.398] BEEN A PROBLEM ALL
[ct=664.660] YEAR.
[ct=667.052] AND PUT HIM IN A SPOT
[ct=671.013] TO GET IT DOWNFIELD.
[ct=672.306] >> Al: AMEER ABDULLAH
[ct=673.645] THEIR RUNNING BACK.
[ct=674.528] THEY’RE MINUS TWO
[ct=677.183] RUNNING BACKS AMONG
[ct=680.737] OTHER THINGS TODAY.
[ct=686.982] JAKOBI MEYERS WHO ONCE
[ct=688.270] DVONTAYE ADAMS BECAME
[ct=690.894] THE WIDE RECEIVER.
[ct=691.762] >> Kirk: IT REALLY
[ct=693.428] FREED UP NOT JUST
[ct=694.881] JAKOBI MEYERS TO
[ct=695.185] BECOME THE TOP
[ct=697.009] RECEIVER BUT ALSO THIS
[ct=699.849] TEAM TO GET THE BALL
[ct=701.177] TO BROCK BOWERS EVEN
[ct=702.061] MORE.
[ct=704.086] AS GOOD AS A TIGHT END
[ct=705.207] I THINK YOU’LL SEE AS
[ct=706.037] A YOUNG PLAYER IN THE
[ct=706.609] NFL.
[ct=707.617] THEY MOVE HIM AROUND,
[ct=708.807] HE’S GOING TO HAVE A
[ct=711.481] BIG DAY TODAY.
[ct=711.626] >> Al: NUMBER 99.
[ct=712.995] YOU SAW ANTONIO PIERCE
[ct=714.124] TOOK OVER LAST YEAR
[ct=715.503] MIDSEASON, GOT THE JOB
[ct=716.240] ON A PERMANENT BASIS,
[ct=717.856] AND WORKING HIS WAY IS
[ct=719.223] ABDULLAH UP TO THE 40
[ct=721.713] NOW, MINUS ALEXANDER
[ct=724.678] MADISON, ZAMIR WHITE
[ct=726.261] WOULD BE THEIR TWO TOP
[ct=727.805] GUYS.
[ct=727.805] EVERY TEAM IN THE
[ct=728.905] LEAGUE HAS THEIR SHARE
[ct=729.369] OF INJURIES.
[ct=731.903] THESE GUYS HAVE HAD A
[ct=732.518] LITTLE BIT MORE.
[ct=734.079] REALLY HAVE.
[ct=734.822] WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR TOP
[ct=735.870] BACKS, YOU FIRE YOUR
[ct=736.962] OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR
[ct=738.155] IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
[ct=739.740] YEAR, AND YOU HAVE
[ct=740.275] SCOTT TURNER TAKE
[ct=740.855] OVER.
[ct=744.561] WE’LL TALK ABOUT THAT.
[ct=745.831] NORA TURNER UP IN THE
[ct=749.308] BOOTH, HIS DAD, AND
[ct=749.308] THESE GUYS ARE DEAD
[ct=750.463] LAST IN THE LEAGUE,
[ct=751.427] GOT TO BE A PRIORITY
[ct=752.528] TONIGHT TO MAKE THIS
[ct=753.037] CHIEFS DEFENSE HAVE TO
[ct=754.402] RESPECT IT.
[ct=754.984] >> Al: WE’RE NIGHT
[ct=755.415] ANIMAL.
[ct=756.341] WE THINK IT’S THE
[ct=757.450] NIGHT, IT’S ACTUALLY
[ct=758.410] THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.
[ct=759.688] I GET THE POINT,
[ct=759.940] THOUGH.
[ct=761.487] IT’S A 4 YARD GAIN
[ct=762.475] HERE.
[ct=763.167] JAKOBI MEYERS.
[ct=763.969] IT’S SO WEIRDS
[ct=767.022] COACHED AND TALKING
[ct=770.388] ABOUT THE UFC TEAM AND
[ct=772.302] TROY AIKMAN, SO MANY
[ct=773.475] GREAT TEAMS HE’S BEEN
[ct=774.584] A PART OF OVER THE
[ct=775.327] YEARS.
[ct=776.606] >> YEAH, HE GAVE THE
[ct=778.221] INDUCTION SPEECH FOR
[ct=779.528] TROY AIKMAN WHEN TROY
[ct=780.877] GOT INTO THE HALL OF
[ct=781.404] FAME.
[ct=782.896] THE BALL IS OUT, BUT
[ct=783.614] THEY’RE GOING TO SAY
[ct=786.664] WITH A FLAG DOWN -- I
[ct=788.475] BELIEVE IT DOWN BY
[ct=790.481] CONTACT THERE AS
[ct=791.165] CONNER CAME IN.
[ct=793.561] SO HE GOT IT TO THE 48
[ct=796.878] CLAY MARTIN, WE’LL
[ct=797.816] HEAR FROM HIM IN A
[ct=799.073] MOMENT.
[ct=799.983] >> Referee: HOLDING
[ct=801.202] OFFENSE NUMBER 58.
[ct=803.411] 10-YARD PENALTY.
[ct=804.565] SECOND DOWN.
[ct=807.176] >> Al: THAT’S THE
[ct=807.176] ROOKIE OUT OF THE
[ct=807.775] OREGON, SECOND-ROUND
[ct=808.724] PICK.
[ct=808.953] JACKSON
[ct=815.254] POWERS-JOHNSON.
[ct=815.579] JPG.
[ct=816.078] >> Kirk: GETS OVER THE
[ct=818.475] NECK OF WHARTON AND
[ct=818.940] TAKES HIM DOWN.
[ct=819.317] HE’S A NASTY OFFENSIVE
[ct=820.880] LINEMAN.
[ct=821.356] WE SAW HIM PLAY QUITE
[ct=823.556] A BIT IN COLLEGE AT
[ct=824.894] OREGON.
[ct=825.559] GOT A COUPLE ROOKIES
[ct=826.657] STARTING TODAY, THE
[ct=830.561] RIGHT TACKLE, D.J.
[ct=834.327] GLAZE AS WELL.
[ct=838.279] >> Al: SO 2nd AND 16.
[ct=844.953] FROM THE 34 YARD LINE.
[ct=845.444] FOUR-MAN RUSH.
[ct=846.722] FLUSHED OUT, EYES
[ct=847.628] DOWNFIELD.
[ct=848.927] THROWS INTO SOME
[ct=849.920] TRAFFIC IN FRONT OF
[ct=851.012] THE CHIEFS BENCH.
[ct=854.403] AND THAT’S DREW
[ct=855.244] TRANQUILL BREAKING IT
[ct=855.244] UP.
[ct=857.646] DEFENSE COMING IN WITH
[ct=858.925] A BIT OF A CHIP ON
[ct=860.158] THEIR SHOULDER OVER
[ct=860.450] THE LAST TWO WEEKS
[ct=861.476] AGAINST BUFFALO AND
[ct=862.798] CAROLINA.
[ct=863.112] THEY GAVE UP MORE
[ct=864.079] POINTS THAN THEY
[ct=868.450] PROBABLY CARE TO DO.
[ct=868.450] SPACKS, A DEFENSIVE
[ct=869.809] COORDINATOR, ONE OF
[ct=870.084] THE BEST IN THE NFL
[ct=872.499] WORKING THROUGH SOME
[ct=873.038] THINGS ON THE BACK END
[ct=873.573] BECAUSE OF SOME
[ct=875.214] INJURIES THEMSELVES
[ct=875.497] THEY’VE DEALT WITH,
[ct=876.509] AND THEY WANT TO CRANK
[ct=877.839] THE PRESSURE UP
[ct=879.090] MUCH MORE THAN THEY
[ct=879.609] HAVE HERE THE LAST FEW
[ct=881.776] WEEKS AFTER THIS
[ct=882.343] QUARTERBACK.
[ct=882.631] >> Al: THEY YIELDED 30
[ct=885.095] TO BUFFALO, AND IN A
[ct=886.327] LOSS YIELDED 27 TO
[ct=888.743] CAROLINA AND WON IT AT
[ct=889.503] THE GUN LAST WEEK.
[ct=890.744] 3rd AND 16.
[ct=892.045] SEND IT OUT TO THE
[ct=893.345] SIDELINE, AND WELL
[ct=893.875] SHORT OF THE FIRST
[ct=895.261] DOWN IS BOWERS.
[ct=896.901] SO IT’LL BE 4th DOWN
[ct=900.091] AND 10 AS BOWERS MAKES
[ct=900.420] HIS FIRST GRAB AND
[ct=901.941] 73rd OF THE SEASON.
[ct=904.744] >> Kirk: RAIDERS ARE
[ct=905.020] JUST NOT EQUIPPED
[ct=905.153] ESPECIALLY AGAINST
[ct=906.193] THIS CHIEFS DEFENSE.
[ct=907.300] HAVE A HOLDING CALL,
[ct=908.480] GET BEHINE THE STICKS
[ct=909.377] LIKE THAT, GET INTO
[ct=911.531] THIS OBVIOUS PASSING
[ct=912.179] SITUATIONS AGAINST IT
[ct=912.832] CHIEFS.
[ct=913.757] AND THE PRESSURE THEY
[ct=914.784] HAVE AND THE WAY THEY
[ct=915.552] CAN MATCHUP IN THE
[ct=917.643] BACK END.
[ct=921.446] >> Al: A.J. COLE
[ct=922.758] PUNT.
[ct=924.046] ONE OF THE BEST IN THE
[ct=925.687] LEAGUE, IN FACT.
[ct=929.471] THE NUMBERS PROVE IT.
[ct=933.478] 52.9 HIS AVERAGE.
[ct=934.190] HARDMAN IS THERE, FLAG
[ct=936.159] IS THROWN, AND THE
[ct=936.544] BALL WILL BOUNCE AND
[ct=938.251] GO OUT OF BOUNDS AT
[ct=939.342] THE 1 YARD LINE, BUT
[ct=940.229] THERE’S A PENALTY
[ct=941.996] MARKER DOWN.
[ct=942.246] CLAY MARTIN IS BACK.
[ct=943.671] HOLDING CALL ON THE
[ct=945.925] RAIDERS.
[ct=947.216] >> Al: YEAH, WHERE
[ct=947.216] THE --
[ct=949.586] >> Kirk: THE OUTBACK
[ct=950.244] HAD A HOLDING CALL.
[ct=951.758] SO A GREAT PUNT.
[ct=952.798] JUST TALKED ABOUT HOW
[ct=954.331] GOOD HE IS.
[ct=955.374] >> Referee: DURING THE
[ct=956.325] KICK HOLDING, RECEIVER
[ct=957.438] TEAM NUMBER 53.
[ct=958.201] PENIMENT IS HALF THE
[ct=959.168] DISTANCE TO THE GOAL
[ct=961.152] FROM THE END OF THE
[ct=961.850] KICK.
[ct=963.859] TIMEOUT.
[ct=964.916] >> Al: AFTER THIS IT’S
[ct=966.239] ABOUT THE HALF YARD
[ct=967.414] DOESN’T GET ANY BETTER
[ct=967.860] THAN THAT.
[ct=968.932] CHIEFS HAVE THE
[ct=972.144] >> Al: ALL RIGHT, SO
[ct=973.110] WHILE YOU WERE OUT IN
[ct=975.045] THE KITCHEN, HERE’S
[ct=976.197] WHAT HAPPENED.
[ct=977.332] WHEN WE LEFT YOU AND
[ct=978.074] WENT TO COMMERCIAL
[ct=979.147] CLAY MARTIN HAD SAID
[ct=979.813] THE PENALTY WAS
[ct=980.622] AGAINST THE CHIEFS.
[ct=981.437] HE MEANT IT WAS
[ct=981.940] AGAINST THE RAIDERS.
[ct=983.066] SO AFTER THE TEAMS HAD
[ct=984.285] GONE DOWN TO THE HALF
[ct=985.389] YARD LINE TO START A
[ct=986.188] CHIEFS DRIVE, HE
[ct=987.840] REALIZED THE PENALTY
[ct=989.268] WAS NOT ON THE CHIEFS.
[ct=990.589] IT WAS ON THE RAIDERS,
[ct=993.334] SO THEY HAD TO REKICK
[ct=995.795] WHILE YOU WERE GONE.
[ct=996.195] WE’RE STILL HERE WITH
[ct=997.164] YOU.
[ct=999.785] THE BALL IS NOW AT THE
[ct=1000.227] 23 YARD LINE.
[ct=1000.401] TERRY, WHAT DO YOU
[ct=1000.777] MAKE OF IT?
[ct=1001.427] >> IT’S JUST AN
[ct=1002.421] ADMINISTRATIVE ERROR
[ct=1003.345] BY THE REFEREE.
[ct=1005.462] HE CLEARLY PUNCHED OUT
[ct=1006.108] FOR COMMERCIAL, AS WE
[ct=1006.714] SAY.
[ct=1007.760] THEY’RE SUPPOSED TO
[ct=1008.071] WAIT FOR TV TO GET
[ct=1008.869] BACK BEFORE THEY PUT
[ct=1010.392] THE BALL BACK IN PLAY.
[ct=1011.676] THEY DIDN’T, WE MISSED
[ct=1011.894] THE PLAY.
[ct=1013.810] IT CLEARLY WAS ON THE
[ct=1014.848] KICKING TEAM, AS YOU
[ct=1015.846] SEE RIGHT THERE,
[ct=1017.343] NUMBER 53.
[ct=1018.420] SO JUST AN
[ct=1020.297] ADMINISTRATIVE MISTAKE
[ct=1021.000] THAT JUST SHOULDN’T
[ct=1021.823] HAVE HAPPENED.
[ct=1024.442] >> Kirk: AND A 22 1/2
[ct=1025.745] YARD DIFFERENCE.
[ct=1029.680] >> Al: YEAH, AND MAYBE
[ct=1031.545] THEY HOLD IT BUT NOT
[ct=1033.170] FOR STREAMING.
[ct=1034.436] LET ME TELL YOU.
[ct=1035.233] ANYWAY, WE’RE ALL
[ct=1036.211] CAUGHT UP.
[ct=1036.858] AND KANSAS CITY HAS
[ct=1038.607] THE BALL IN ITS OWN 23
[ct=1040.040] >> Kirk: AND A GREAT
[ct=1041.242] REMINDER IF FOLKS WHO
[ct=1043.782] HAVE NOT SEEN A LOT OF
[ct=1044.003] THE CHIEFS.
[ct=1045.209] THIS TEAM IN THE PAST
[ct=1045.882] EARLY YEARS OF
[ct=1049.127] MAHOMES, IT WAS ABOUT
[ct=1049.525] THE EXPLOSIVE OFFENSE.
[ct=1051.080] IN THE LAST COUPLE OF
[ct=1051.525] YEARS BECAUSE OF THE
[ct=1052.524] STYLE DEFENSE THEY
[ct=1054.081] PLAY, IT’S ABOUT
[ct=1055.071] SUSTAINING DRIVES.
[ct=1055.518] IT’S ABOUT SHORT GAME
[ct=1057.146] PASSING GAME,
[ct=1057.368] INTERMEDIATE PASSING
[ct=1058.397] GAME, RUNNING THE
[ct=1059.503] FOOTBALL.
[ct=1060.045] LAST DRIVE THEY HAD,
[ct=1061.486] WHAT, 14 PLAYS?
[ct=1062.594] SO THAT’S KIND OF THE
[ct=1063.782] NEW MAHOMES OFFENSE
[ct=1064.657] BECAUSE OF THE WAY
[ct=1065.874] TEAMS TYPICALLY TRY TO
[ct=1066.702] DEFEND THEM AND NOT
[ct=1071.508] GIVE HIM THOSE HOMERUN
[ct=1071.701] THREATS.
[ct=1074.257] >> Al: WELL, THEY’VE
[ct=1077.303] HAD 32 DRIVES, I GUESS
[ct=1078.279] 33 COUNTING THIS LAST
[ct=1080.575] ONE, WHICH WAS 14
[ct=1081.100] PLAYS LEADING TO A
[ct=1083.176] FIELD GOAL.
[ct=1084.009] THAT’S MOST IN THE
[ct=1085.887] THAT’S ALMOST THREE
[ct=1089.925] LONG DRIVES PER GAME.
[ct=1090.172] >> Kirk: YEAH.
[ct=1090.847] AND, AGAIN, IT’S A
[ct=1091.565] CREDIT REALLY TO
[ct=1093.387] MAHOMES AND RANDY REID
[ct=1094.907] FOR ADJUSTING FROM
[ct=1095.373] WHERE THEY WERE THREE
[ct=1096.734] OR FOUR YEARS AGO TO
[ct=1097.546] HOW TEAMS NOW DEFEND
[ct=1097.975] THEM.
[ct=1098.913] THEY’VE HAD TO BECOME
[ct=1099.751] MORE PATIENT.
[ct=1100.394] THEY’VE COME UP WITH
[ct=1101.902] AN ANSWER.
[ct=1101.902] INITIALLY IT WAS A
[ct=1102.327] LITTLE BIT OF A
[ct=1103.052] CHALLENGE FOR THEM.
[ct=1104.138] NOW IT’S WHAT THEY SEE
[ct=1106.356] EVERY WEEK, SO IT’S
[ct=1107.012] WHAT THEY KNOW.
[ct=1108.036] IT FORCES THEM TO BE
[ct=1108.496] PATIENT.
[ct=1109.569] AND THEY GO TO THEIR
[ct=1110.839] RUNNING GAME AND THAT
[ct=1111.828] SHORT PASSING GAME,
[ct=1112.854] AND YARDS AFTER THE
[ct=1113.737] CATCH IS WHAT NOW
[ct=1118.829] BECOMES A PREMIUM.
[ct=1119.093] >> Al: START THE DRIVE
[ct=1119.406] WITH A RUN HERE.
[ct=1122.157] A 2-YARD PICKUP FOR
[ct=1123.729] KAREEM HUNT.
[ct=1124.507] >> Kirk: AND WHAT IT
[ct=1127.123] DOES IT REALLY SHOWS
[ct=1128.377] THE RELATIONSHIP
[ct=1129.927] BETWEEN MAHOMES,
[ct=1131.231] KELCE, THE OTHER TIGHT
[ct=1133.987] END, NOAH GRAY,
[ct=1137.350] JUJUSMITH-SCHUSTER,
[ct=1137.707] THOSE GUYS COMING
[ct=1140.738] THOSE GUYS ARE PART OF
[ct=1141.188] THAT INTERMEDIATE
[ct=1141.610] PASSING GAME AND
[ct=1142.727] FINDING THAT SOFT SPOT
[ct=1144.594] IN THE ZONE.
[ct=1145.947] BOY, 15 HAS A WAY OF
[ct=1146.427] LOCATING YOU AND
[ct=1147.496] GETTING THE BALL TO
[ct=1153.364] >> Al: 2nd DOWN AND 8.
[ct=1153.698] PROTECTION.
[ct=1154.700] MAKING THE CATCH, ON
[ct=1157.289] THE MOVE.
[ct=1158.868] TRAVIS KELCE.
[ct=1160.607] >> Kirk: THERE IT IS.
[ct=1161.269] >> Al: IT’S SO FUNNY,
[ct=1162.288] HE’S GOT THE OTHER
[ct=1164.185] TIGHT END NO GRAY
[ct=1165.925] WHO’S REALLY COMING
[ct=1168.029] INTO HIS OWN AS WELL.
[ct=1169.586] SO MUCH OF THIS
[ct=1170.182] OFFENSE NOW REVOLVING
[ct=1171.822] AROUND THESE TWO GUY.
[ct=1175.128] >> Kirk: WATCH DEABLO,
[ct=1177.382] A FORMER SAFETY OUT OF
[ct=1178.062] COLLEGE.
[ct=1178.866] NOBODY CAN STAY WITH
[ct=1180.448] THE WAY HE’S RUNNING
[ct=1181.704] THAT ROUTE INITIALLY
[ct=1183.398] YOU’RE THINKING A
[ct=1184.041] SHALLOW CROSS, AND
[ct=1184.754] PUTS THE FOOT IN THE
[ct=1186.079] GROUND AND WORKS
[ct=1188.556] HIGHWAY BACK.
[ct=1189.764] AND MAHOMES FINDS HIM
[ct=1191.083] QUICKLY FOR THAT FIRST
[ct=1193.164] >> Al: MAHOMES, CATCH
[ct=1193.801] IS MADE, BREAKING THE
[ct=1196.765] TACKLE HERE.
[ct=1204.585] JuJu SMITH-SCHUSTER.
[ct=1205.360] >> Kirk: AND THE EXTRA
[ct=1206.443] YARDAGE AND HOW TEAMS
[ct=1207.284] ARE DEFENDING AND THE
[ct=1209.716] ANSWER TO THAT THERE
[ct=1209.952] IT IS.
[ct=1211.141] CUT TO KELCE YARDS
[ct=1212.640] AFTER THE CATCH, COME
[ct=1214.009] BACK FOR VERY NEXT
[ct=1217.967] PLAY GET IT TO JuJu
[ct=1219.303] SMITH-SCHUSTER.
[ct=1219.545] YARDS AFTER THE CATCH
[ct=1220.199] FOR A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1222.111] THIS IS WHO THEY ARE.
[ct=1223.298] THIS IS THE CHIEFS FOR
[ct=1225.928] THESE LAST COUPLE OF
[ct=1226.292] >> Al: ALREADY SIX
[ct=1227.075] FIRST DOWNS IN THE
[ct=1227.947] FIRST TEN MINUTES OF
[ct=1231.422] KAREEM HUNT, SHORT
[ct=1233.213] GAIN HERE 2nd AND
[ct=1233.392] LONG.
[ct=1234.434] >> Kirk: WHAT IT DOES
[ct=1235.483] IS PUT EVEN MORE ON
[ct=1236.218] THE SHOULDERS OF THE
[ct=1236.739] QUARTERBACK BECAUSE
[ct=1237.508] YOU’VE GOT TO BE ABLE
[ct=1238.341] TO BE CONSISTENT WITH
[ct=1238.932] THAT PATIENT APPROACH.
[ct=1240.085] YOU’RE GOING TO MOVE
[ct=1240.685] THE BALL DOWN THE
[ct=1241.949] FIELD, AND THEN IT ALL
[ct=1242.739] COMES DOWN TO WHAT
[ct=1243.871] WILL YOU DO IN THE RED
[ct=1245.023] ZONE WHEN IT COMES TO
[ct=1246.255] EXECUTION?
[ct=1247.643] FIRST TIME THEY GOT
[ct=1248.091] DOWN THERE THEY HAD TO
[ct=1248.878] SETTLE FOR A FIELD
[ct=1249.732] GOAL, SO THAT WAS
[ct=1251.103] REALLY A RAIDERS WIN
[ct=1252.318] ON THAT OPENING DRIVE,
[ct=1253.307] EVEN THOUGH THEY
[ct=1254.606] ALLOWED THEM TO HAVE
[ct=1256.899] THE BALL FOR 14 PLAYS.
[ct=1258.391] >> Al: KELCE IN THE
[ct=1259.745] RIGHT SLOT.
[ct=1260.143] MAHOMES, CHECKS IT
[ct=1261.384] DOWN TO NUMBER 1, AND
[ct=1263.136] NUMBER ONE PICK AND A
[ct=1263.842] FLAG IS DOWN.

[ct=1295.900] HE SAID ONE OF THE
[ct=1297.069] THINGS YOU’VE GOT TO
[ct=1297.995] GET HANDS ON HIM.
[ct=1299.157] THAT’S TOO MANY HANDS.
[ct=1300.676] GIVES THEM A HOLD.

[ct=1931.726] IMPASSIVE LOOK ON THE
[ct=1934.143] OKAY.

[ct=1947.663] TO THE 4 YARD LINE
[ct=1958.490] GOES BROCK BOWERS.
[ct=1959.020] DRUE TRANQUILL STOPS

[ct=1963.066] COVERAGE ON THE PLAY
[ct=1963.799] ACTION LOOK.
[ct=1964.458] LOVE THE AGGRESSIVE
[ct=1965.624] CALL THERE BY SCOTT

[ct=1968.616] WITH THE PENALTY 1st
[ct=1970.028] AND 15.
[ct=1971.292] >> Al: SAW BOLTON
[ct=1972.167] SHAKEN UP AT THE END
[ct=1973.330] OF THE FIRST QUARTER.
[ct=1977.264] HE’S BACK IN THERE.
[ct=1980.171] DRIVE STARTED AT THEIR
[ct=1981.396] OWN 8 YARD LINE.
[ct=1985.163] 2nd DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=1986.566] BOWERS INTO THE SLOT
[ct=1989.075] TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=1990.364] PLAY CLOCK AT 1:00.
[ct=1991.706] KEEP IT ON THE GROUND.
[ct=1993.243] INTO A BRICK WALL GOES
[ct=1994.319] ABDULLAH.
[ct=2005.312] 3rd AND GOAL.
[ct=2006.014] ANTONIO PIERCE DURING
[ct=2007.278] THE WEEK GOES, HEY,
[ct=2008.094] IT’S THE WORST TEAM IN
[ct=2009.558] FOOTBALL AGAINST
[ct=2010.968] BEST.
[ct=2012.293] HAVE SOME FUN.
[ct=2013.529] >> Kirk: RIGHT.
[ct=2014.889] WHAT THE HECK?
[ct=2016.264] IT SURE HELPS WHEN
[ct=2016.456] YOUR QUARTERBACK CAN
[ct=2017.377] MAKE A FEW THROWCH
[ct=2019.263] DIFFERENCE, GETTING A
[ct=2020.763] QUARTERBACK THAT CAN
[ct=2021.571] GET THE BALL DOWNFIELD
[ct=2022.449] AND BE DECISIVE, NOT
[ct=2024.640] HOLDING ONTO IT.
[ct=2024.845] POWERS IS GOING TO BE
[ct=2030.424] OUT TO HIS RIGHT.
[ct=2031.017] >> Al: MEYERS WIDE
[ct=2034.152] O’CONNELL IN THE
[ct=2035.449] POCKET, BREAKS AWAY.
[ct=2036.835] DOWN HE GOES AT THE 9
[ct=2039.232] CHASED DOWN BY CHRIS
[ct=2043.648] HADN’T MENTIONED HIS
[ct=2044.038] NAME UNTIL NOW, BUT
[ct=2045.145] SOONER OR LATER HERE
[ct=2046.274] COMES 95.
[ct=2046.942] >> Kirk: A MATTER OF
[ct=2048.121] TIME ESPECIALLY ON
[ct=2048.880] THESE THIRD DOWN
[ct=2049.867] SITUATIONS.
[ct=2050.261] YOU GET MATCHED UP
[ct=2051.342] AGAINST A ROOKIE.
[ct=2052.458] BUT THIS IS REALLY AS
[ct=2055.135] MUCH ABOUT COVERAGE AS
[ct=2055.645] IT IS ANYTHING.
[ct=2056.403] THAT AND A RELENTLESS
[ct=2057.687] APPROACH BY 95.
[ct=2058.418] I THINK HE’S LOOKING
[ct=2059.542] INITIALLY TO BROCK
[ct=2060.433] BOWERS TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=2061.523] NOW HE STEPS UP, THIS
[ct=2064.489] IS NOT HIS GAME.
[ct=2064.489] CREATING AND GETTING
[ct=2065.754] AWAY FROM A PASS RUSH
[ct=2068.462] IS NOT WHAT AIDAN
[ct=2068.462] O’CONNELL IS KNOWN
[ct=2069.275] FOR, AND JONES BRINGS
[ct=2072.430] HIM DOWN.
[ct=2072.827] >> Al: DANIEL CARLSON
[ct=2076.457] FOR THE 27-YARD FIELD
[ct=2077.753] GOAL ATTEMPT.
[ct=2079.465] KICK IS GOOD.
[ct=2081.719] TO TIE IT.
[ct=2081.719] JONES WAS HUNGRY,
[ct=2088.544] SINCE WEEK 4. SUPER BOWL AS A
[ct=2089.656] STARTER.
[ct=2092.548] ALL HE’S WON IS THREE.
[ct=2096.483] INCREDIBLE TO THINK OF
[ct=2099.122] ALL THOSE DRAFTED AND
[ct=2099.615] HE’S THE ONLY GUY TO
[ct=2100.168] WIN AS A STARTER.
[ct=2100.885] AND AS YOU SAID THREE
[ct=2101.392] OF THEM.
[ct=2102.493] FEEL LIKE HE’S STILL
[ct=2103.417] JUST WARMING UP.
[ct=2104.428] WHO KNOWS HOW MANY
[ct=2105.701] HE’S GOING TO END UP
[ct=2107.630] WITH.
[ct=2107.798] >> Al: AS MOTIVATED AS
[ct=2109.060] EVER.
[ct=2109.431] AND YOU TALK ABOUT A
[ct=2109.978] MARRIAGE MADE IN
[ct=2110.925] HEAVEN.
[ct=2111.821] HE AND ANDY REID AND
[ct=2112.610] THE WAY THIS
[ct=2113.397] ORGANIZATION IS RUN,
[ct=2117.564] BETTER.
[ct=2119.467] >> Kirk: NOPE.
[ct=2120.988] >> Al: SO CARLSON
[ct=2121.918] READY TO KICK OFF.
[ct=2124.286] GAME TIED 3-3.
[ct=2125.597] 4 MINUTES INTO THE
[ct=2133.559] SECOND QUART.
[ct=2134.944] HARDMAN AND PERYAN ARE
[ct=2135.764] BACK FOR KANSAS CITY.
[ct=2139.281] FROM THE 1, HARDMAN.
[ct=2143.064] UP TO THE 23 YARDLINE YARD RUN
[ct=2144.239] AGAINST CAROLINA.
[ct=2144.614] HE’S THINKING ON HIS
[ct=2146.018] WAY TO THE HIS 33 YARD
[ct=2147.563] RUN, IF I HAVE BUTKER
[ct=2148.729] I DON’T HAVE TO GET
[ct=2149.442] PAST THE 50.
[ct=2150.511] BUT WITH THE OTHER GUY
[ct=2151.697] KICKING LAST WEEK, I
[ct=2153.434] HAD TO GET DEEPER INTO
[ct=2155.074] CAROLINA TERRITORY.
[ct=2156.091] AND MEANWHILE, STUFFED
[ct=2157.978] IN THE BACKFIELD HERE
[ct=2159.290] IS MAXX CROSBY TAKING
[ct=2163.237] AHOLD OF ISIAH
[ct=2164.609] PACHECO.
[ct=2165.251] >> Kirk: I THINK IT’S
[ct=2167.038] THE HUMILITY, THE
[ct=2167.525] PASSION, THE
[ct=2168.604] COMPETITIVE SPIRIT,
[ct=2170.008] AND HE AND ANDY REID
[ct=2170.702] JUST BEING CONNECTED
[ct=2171.831] IN A WAY WHERE THEY’RE
[ct=2172.892] CONTINUING TO JUST --
[ct=2173.539] YEAH, THEY HAVE A
[ct=2174.271] SYSTEM.
[ct=2175.597] BUT IT JUST FEELS LIKE
[ct=2176.779] THEY’RE CONSTANTLY
[ct=2178.596] TWEAKING, CONSTANTLY
[ct=2179.225] COMING UP WITH A NEW
[ct=2181.246] WRINKLE.
[ct=2182.119] IT MAKES IT MORE FUN I
[ct=2183.022] THINK FOR THE OFFENSE
[ct=2183.504] AROUND HIM.
[ct=2184.082] I THINK FOR THE
[ct=2185.271] HUMILITY, THOUGH, HOW
[ct=2186.537] HE GETS A NEW PLAYER
[ct=2187.605] IN, WANTS TO WORK WITH
[ct=2188.357] HIM, WANTS TO GET
[ct=2189.635] LIKE ALL THE GREAT
[ct=2191.758] ONES, THAT COMPETITIVE
[ct=2193.467] FIRE IS WHAT SEPARATES
[ct=2194.793] HIM FROM THE REST.
[ct=2195.697] >> Al: 2nd AND 15.
[ct=2196.666] CHECKS IT DOWN HERE,
[ct=2197.972] CATCH IS MADE.
[ct=2200.538] SHORT GAIN FOR PACHECO
[ct=2201.898] AND THIRD DOWN.
[ct=2203.437] >> Kirk: THIS RAIDERS
[ct=2204.040] DEFENSE AS WE’RE
[ct=2204.935] TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF
[ct=2206.031] DIFFERENT THINGS, THIS
[ct=2207.632] IS EXACTLY HOW ANTONIO
[ct=2208.546] PIERCE ENVISIONED IT.
[ct=2210.056] THIS IS WHAT HE TALKED
[ct=2211.266] ABOUT, HOW HE THOUGHT
[ct=2214.128] ABOUT.
[ct=2216.688] WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE
[ct=2218.054] OPEN HOW DO THEY RANG
[ct=2218.254] OPEN HOW DO THEY RHANG
[ct=2218.851] AROUND, AND THEY’VE
[ct=2219.866] GOT TO COME IN WITH AN
[ct=2221.211] ATTITUDE AND BELIEF,
[ct=2223.463] AND THEY’VE GOT TO GET
[ct=2224.716] MAHOMES BEHIND THE
[ct=2225.504] STICKS.
[ct=2226.347] AND EVEN WHEN THEY
[ct=2228.437] HAVE GIVEN UP SOME
[ct=2228.865] YARDS, THEY’VE DONE
[ct=2229.987] THEIR JOB IN THE RED
[ct=2232.836] MUMOEMS IS GOING TO
[ct=2235.326] GET SACKED AT THE 15
[ct=2237.036] YOU TALK ABOUT YOU WIN
[ct=2238.303] ON DEFENSE.
[ct=2244.921] THAT TIME IT’S K’LAVON
[ct=2246.852] CHAISSON.
[ct=2247.765] THEY WON WITH TWO
[ct=2251.903] DEFENSIVE TOUCHDOWNS
[ct=2253.602] LAST YEAR.
[ct=2254.020] >> Kirk: THAT’S RIGHT.
[ct=2254.474] AND THIS IS THE ISSUE
[ct=2254.882] FOR THE CHIEFS.
[ct=2255.194] NOT JUST TODAY BUT
[ct=2256.117] CHAISSON WITH GREAT
[ct=2256.550] HANDS THERE.
[ct=2257.595] HE USES IT TO GET AWAY
[ct=2259.522] FROM THE TACKLES.
[ct=2260.411] MORRIS WHO CONTINUES
[ct=2261.215] TO STRUGGLE WITH THE
[ct=2261.935] BLIND SIDE.
[ct=2263.291] LOOK HOW QUICK HE GOT
[ct=2264.421] OFF OF THE LEFT TACKLE
[ct=2265.535] AND AROUND HIM.
[ct=2266.399] AND MAHOMES NEVER HAD
[ct=2268.860] A CHANCE TO GET AWAY
[ct=2269.478] FROM THAT PRESSURE.
[ct=2270.712] >> Al: SO THE CHIEFS
[ct=2274.369] FORCED TO PUNT.
[ct=2277.265] 36 YARD LINE, D.J.
[ct=2278.153] TURNER COMING TO THE
[ct=2279.265] NEAR SIDE, TRYING TO
[ct=2281.193] GET AROUND THE CORNER.
[ct=2282.797] HE GETS POPPED AT THE
[ct=2289.603] 45. JUSTIN REED.
[ct=2290.687] AND GET THIS, EVEN
[ct=2290.879] ANTONIO PIERCE WHO
[ct=2291.525] PLAYED FOR SPAGNUOLO
[ct=2292.428] WITH THE GIANTS TOLD
[ct=2293.092] US HE IS LOOKING
[ct=2295.217] FORWARD TO A BROWN BAG
[ct=2295.630] WITH THAT PUDDING
[ct=2296.699] INSIDE AFTER THIS
[ct=2297.886] GAME.
[ct=2298.074] >> Al: THAT WOULD
[ct=2299.598] MOTIVATE ME.
[ct=2300.719] >> Kirk: NO DOUBT.
[ct=2303.212] HEARD ALL WEEK ABOUT
[ct=2304.557] HOW MANY GREAT MEALS
[ct=2304.946] SHE CAN MAKE.
[ct=2305.860] WE’RE GOING TO HAVE TO
[ct=2307.219] SETUP A LITTLE BIT OF
[ct=2308.402] FREE TIME NEXT TIME WE
[ct=2310.339] DO THE CHIEFS.
[ct=2310.769] >> Al: 1,000%.
[ct=2312.515] I’M ALL IN.
[ct=2315.740] >> Kirk: HOW ABOUT THE
[ct=2318.304] JOB AIDAN O’CONNELL
[ct=2320.018] HAS DONE?
[ct=2320.840] RAIDERS GOT 3 POINTS,
[ct=2324.156] ENVIRONMENT.
[ct=2324.541] >> Al: FRACTURED THUMB
[ct=2325.018] APPEARS TO BE NO
[ct=2325.444] ISSUE.
[ct=2326.074] THAT’S ONLY THE SECOND
[ct=2327.081] INCOMPLETION.
[ct=2328.088] TRY TO HIT BOWERS
[ct=2330.031] THERE 2nd AND 10.
[ct=2331.142] HE’S RIGHT NOW AS YOU
[ct=2335.544] LOOK AT O’CONNELL 7-9
[ct=2337.574] FROM 99 YARDS.
[ct=2338.223] >> Kirk: HE HAD THE
[ct=2339.727] THUMB THAT TOOK HIM
[ct=2342.402] OUT WEEK 7.
[ct=2343.082] MINSHEW BACK IN.
[ct=2343.813] WATCHING HIM PREGAME
[ct=2344.735] HERE, I DON’T THINK
[ct=2345.566] IT’S ON HIS MIND.
[ct=2346.424] I THINK HE’S PLAYING
[ct=2349.775] WITH CONFIDENCE.
[ct=2349.775] I THINK HE’S FOCUSED
[ct=2350.158] IN ON THE CHIEF AND
[ct=2350.619] THE COVERAGE AND
[ct=2351.161] DISTRIBUTING THIS
[ct=2352.706] >> Al: INTO THE
[ct=2354.918] BACKFIELD COMES ONE
[ct=2359.364] SINCERE McCORMICK.
[ct=2361.562] ROOKIE OUT OF TEXAS,
[ct=2364.635] SAN ANTON QUO.
[ct=2365.246] O’CONNELL CHASED, LOOK
[ct=2368.601] OUT FROM BEHIND.
[ct=2369.010] GETS IT AWAY, COMING
[ct=2370.346] BACK TO MAKE THE GRAB
[ct=2371.656] HERE IS BROCK BOWERS.
[ct=2373.155] SO HE COMES BACK.
[ct=2375.651] MEANWHILE, JUSTIN REED
[ct=2376.776] WAS CHASING O’CONNELL,
[ct=2377.940] GOT IT OUT OF THE WAY
[ct=2378.984] AND PICKS UP A FEW
[ct=2379.771] YARDS HERE.
[ct=2382.323] BLITZED FROM HIS BLIND
[ct=2383.638] SIDE, AND NOW YOU’VE
[ct=2384.269] GOT A MATCHUP YOU LIKE
[ct=2384.645] TO SEE.
[ct=2386.961] WAS SO MUCH PRESSURE
[ct=2387.809] HE COULDN’T GET MUCH
[ct=2389.771] ON IT.
[ct=2390.347] SO IT BROUGHT THE
[ct=2391.110] ROOKIE BACK, BUT A
[ct=2393.556] GREAT ADJUSTMENTS BY
[ct=2396.233] BOWERS TO GET THE
[ct=2397.931] >> Al: GAIN OF 9
[ct=2400.288] THERE, 3rd DOWN AND 1.
[ct=2402.941] ON THE CHIEFS SIDE OF
[ct=2404.811] THE 50, AND HAND IT,
[ct=2405.490] COMES AROUND FROM THE
[ct=2406.168] SIDE THAT TIME IS
[ct=2409.511] HAD HIM IN MOTION,
[ct=2412.764] TACKLED THERE BY
[ct=2413.253] JOSHUA WILLIAMS.
[ct=2414.291] FIRST DOWN RAIDERS.
[ct=2415.759] >> Kirk: THIS KID’S A
[ct=2416.441] FREAK.
[ct=2416.672] BY THE WAY, THIS IS
[ct=2419.026] WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE AS
[ct=2421.388] A TRUE FRESHMAN WHEN
[ct=2421.865] HE SHOWED UP AT
[ct=2422.058] GEORGIA.
[ct=2422.510] AND THIS IS LOT OF THE
[ct=2423.497] PLAYS HE RAN.
[ct=2424.507] HE WOULD RUN THAT JET
[ct=2425.170] SWEEP.
[ct=2426.005] USUALLY THAT’S A
[ct=2426.962] RECEIVER PLAY.
[ct=2431.576] THIS GUY AT 6’4", 234
[ct=2431.961] POUNDS HE’S ATHLETIC,
[ct=2432.883] EXPLOSIVE, GOES
[ct=2435.341] AIRBORNE.
[ct=2435.546] JOSH WILLIAMS WONDERED
[ct=2436.676] WHERE HE WENT.
[ct=2437.270] WENT UP AND OVER FOR
[ct=2440.946] OUTGAINED THE CHIEFS
[ct=2442.102] BY 22 YARDS TO THIS
[ct=2445.387] POINT.
[ct=2445.828] McCORMICK.
[ct=2446.454] SINCERE McCORMICK TO
[ct=2447.949] THE 27 YARD LINE.
[ct=2449.334] ROOKIE FREE AGENT.
[ct=2450.400] >> Kirk: LIKE TO LOOK
[ct=2451.572] AT THIS GUY.
[ct=2453.305] AND HE RUNS.
[ct=2454.659] HE JUST SHOOK OFF NICK
[ct=2455.925] BOLTON.
[ct=2455.925] YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT
[ct=2457.035] WHO’S BACK IN THE
[ct=2457.666] LINE-UP, YOU’RE
[ct=2458.804] TALKING ABOUT ONE OF
[ct=2459.399] THE BETTER LINE
[ct=2460.204] BACKERS IN THE NFL,
[ct=2462.766] AND HERE’S A GUY JUST
[ct=2463.376] TRYING TO MAKE A NAME
[ct=2464.381] FOR HIMSELF, JUST
[ct=2465.131] TRYING TO GET ANY
[ct=2467.202] CARRIES AT ALL.
[ct=2467.202] YOU MENTION HIM THIS
[ct=2468.663] IS A PRACTICE SQUAD
[ct=2469.333] GUY ESSENTIALLY
[ct=2469.524] THROUGH THE LAST
[ct=2470.815] COUPLE OF YEARS.
[ct=2473.130] LAST WEEK HE GETS
[ct=2473.314] BROUGHT UP FIVE
[ct=2475.833] CARRIES, RAISED ENOUGH
[ct=2477.209] EYEBROWS DETERMINED TO
[ct=2477.900] GET HIS HANDS ON A
[ct=2480.490] FOOTBALL AGAIN TODAY.
[ct=2482.581] >> Al: AND THESE GUYS
[ct=2483.635] RUNNING A STORM RIGHT
[ct=2490.228] FAKED TO HIM, LOOK
[ct=2490.857] OUT, PRESSURE, HAS TO
[ct=2491.026] DUMP IT AWAY.
[ct=2493.329] THAT TIME KARLAFTIS
[ct=2494.033] CAME FLYING THROUGH.
[ct=2495.114] JONES IS TRYING TO
[ct=2497.243] PLEAD THE CASE IT
[ct=2497.825] SHOULD BE GROUNDING.
[ct=2498.333] FOR THE MOMENT THERE’S
[ct=2499.821] NO FLAG, BUT THERE IS
[ct=2500.628] A CONVERSATION.
[ct=2503.021] >> Kirk: I THINK A
[ct=2503.199] TIGHT END MICHAEL
[ct=2505.897] MEYER WAS RIGHT THERE
[ct=2508.350] AND FLIPPED IT TO HIM,
[ct=2510.041] BUT HE WAS RIGHT
[ct=2511.731] THERE’S A TIGHT END
[ct=2512.458] RIGHT HERE MICHAEL
[ct=2515.505] MEYER.
[ct=2516.617] HE’S BLOCKING, LOOKS
[ct=2517.943] LIKE A LINEMAN, BUT HE
[ct=2519.603] THROWS IT RIGHT AT HIS
[ct=2520.978] FEET.
[ct=2522.128] >> Referee: INELIGIBLE
[ct=2523.929] PLAYER DOWNFIELD.
[ct=2524.765] >> Al: AND THAT’S A
[ct=2526.731] DIFFERENT STORY.
[ct=2528.564] SETTING UP A SCREEN
[ct=2529.946] AND THOSE LINEMEN ARE
[ct=2532.317] GETTING DOWNFIELD.
[ct=2533.175] KARLAFTIS DOES A GOOD
[ct=2534.770] JOB OF BEING ABLE TO
[ct=2535.571] APPLY THAT PRESSURE
[ct=2536.571] WHERE THE SCREEN NEVER
[ct=2537.199] HAD MUCH OF A CHANCE.
[ct=2538.675] IT WAS ON THE RIGHT
[ct=2543.745] GUARD, PARHAM.
[ct=2545.337] NOW, THESE GUYS ARE
[ct=2546.913] JUST TRYING TO RUN A
[ct=2547.624] STREAM.
[ct=2548.888] THEY’RE NOT EXPECTING
[ct=2549.097] THAT PRESSURE TO GET
[ct=2549.934] TO THE QUARTERBACK
[ct=2551.544] THAT QUICKLY.
[ct=2551.900] THEY OF COURSE
[ct=2554.045] IDEA.
[ct=2554.263] THEY’RE RUNNING THE
[ct=2557.116] PLAY CALL.
[ct=2559.401] GIVE AN ASTERISK AND A
[ct=2559.682] MARK THERE TO
[ct=2560.587] KARLAFTIS FOR CAUSING
[ct=2561.580] THAT.
[ct=2562.030] >> Al: SO 2nd DOWN AND
[ct=2565.409] 8 AFTER THE PENALTY.
[ct=2569.137] ON THE GROUND AGAIN.
[ct=2571.796] 38 YARD LINE.
[ct=2573.979] NICK BOLTON MAKES THE
[ct=2575.968] TACKLE ON McCORMICK.
[ct=2576.673] THIRD DOWN.
[ct=2577.235] >> Kirk: AND A BIG
[ct=2578.175] PART OF RUNNING THE
[ct=2581.045] FOOTBALL IS NOT JUST,
[ct=2581.556] HEY, WE WANT TO TAKE
[ct=2582.283] THE PRESSURE OFF OUR
[ct=2582.691] PROTECTION AND
[ct=2583.473] OFFENSIVE LINE, IT’S
[ct=2584.033] KEEPING HIM ON THE
[ct=2585.983] AGAIN, THEY ARE DEAD
[ct=2588.108] LAST IN THE NFL IN
[ct=2589.414] RUNNING THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=2589.414] AND WITH A NEW
[ct=2590.228] COORDINATOR, THEY’RE
[ct=2591.156] TRYING TO RUN-DOWN
[ct=2592.193] HILL.
[ct=2592.721] THEY’RE NOT TRYING TO
[ct=2594.120] RUN WIDE OUTSIDE ZONE.
[ct=2595.262] THEY’RE TRYING TO RUN
[ct=2597.123] DOWNHILL, AND IT’S
[ct=2598.298] BEEN EFFECTIVE ENOUGH.
[ct=2600.598] AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
[ct=2602.345] HERE THEY ARE 3rd AND
[ct=2603.403] 4.
[ct=2604.918] >> Al: TEAM AVERAGING
[ct=2606.056] ONLY 75 YARDS PER
[ct=2608.320] THEY HAVE 29 ON 8
[ct=2610.190] CARRIES.
[ct=2610.582] O’CONNELL HANGING IN
[ct=2611.505] THE POCKET, FIRES
[ct=2612.042] OVER, AND NEARLY
[ct=2613.169] PICKED OFF.
[ct=2614.117] NICK BOLTON WAS RIGHT
[ct=2615.270] THERE AT THE 30 TO
[ct=2616.204] BREAK IT UP.
[ct=2617.517] FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=2619.814] >> Kirk: WE JUST
[ct=2620.361] TALKED ABOUT BOLTON.
[ct=2622.441] THIS IS FANTASTIC.
[ct=2622.895] ONE OF THE MORE
[ct=2623.660] INTELLIGENT MIDDLE
[ct=2625.378] LINE BACKERS.
[ct=2626.836] WATCH HIS HEAD THE
[ct=2627.581] ENTIRE TIME WITH THESE
[ct=2628.351] CROSSERS.
[ct=2628.686] MESH ROUTE, HE’S
[ct=2629.860] LOOKING LEFT, LOOKING
[ct=2630.976] RIGHT, EVERYTHING IN
[ct=2631.737] AND STILL THE
[ct=2632.550] AWARENESS TO READ THE
[ct=2633.897] QUARTERBACK’S EYES AND
[ct=2636.492] GET AIRBORNE TO KNOCK
[ct=2636.702] THAT FOOTBALL AWAY,
[ct=2637.275] OTHERWISE THAT’S A
[ct=2639.511] THAT’S A BIG-TIME PLAY
[ct=2642.592] BY BOLTON.
[ct=2646.156] >> Al: 56 YARDS FOR
[ct=2647.478] CARLSON.
[ct=2654.375] A.J. COLE TO SPOT IT.
[ct=2655.550] AND CARLSON, ONE OF
[ct=2658.619] LEAGUE, NO
[ct=2664.992] SHORT.
[ct=2666.563] SO KANSAS CITY WILL
[ct=2667.659] TAKE OVER NEAR
[ct=2669.390] MIDFIELD.
[ct=2669.965] 5:55 TO THE HALF.
[ct=2670.126] 3-3.
[ct=2671.935] WATCH, MAD MAX.
[ct=2672.715] DOESN’T CARE WHAT
[ct=2673.340] THEIR RECORD IS,
[ct=2674.549] BRINGS A COMPETITIVE
[ct=2675.165] SPIRIT.
[ct=2675.751] REALLY SETS THE TONE
[ct=2676.439] IN THAT BUILDING FOR
[ct=2677.213] THE RAIDERS, AND HE
[ct=2678.344] WORKS ON HIS BODY,
[ct=2680.524] WORKS ON HIS GAME
[ct=2681.355] YEAR-ROUND.
[ct=2682.148] LOOK AT THE SACKS,
[ct=2683.202] SECOND MOST FROM THAT
[ct=2684.732] 2019 DRAFT CLASS, THE
[ct=2685.961] DEFENSIVE SNAPS.
[ct=2692.075] >> Al: MEANWHILE, THAT
[ct=2692.720] DEFENSE NOW FROM
[ct=2694.770] KANSAS CITY STARTING
[ct=2696.047] AT THE 47.
[ct=2698.905] FREE, WIDE OPEN, NOAH
[ct=2699.265] GRAY!
[ct=2701.772] TO THE 25-YARD LINE HE
[ct=2702.869] GOES.
[ct=2703.661] TACKLE THERE BY
[ct=2705.924] SPILLANE.
[ct=2709.437] SO WE’RE TALKING ABOUT
[ct=2710.349] GRAY HAD TWO TOUCHDOWN
[ct=2711.996] CATCHES OVER HIS FIRST
[ct=2714.305] 60 SOME ODD GAMES, HAD
[ct=2715.542] FOUR IN THE LAST TWO
[ct=2717.796] >> Kirk: YEAH, DONE A
[ct=2718.850] GOOD JOB OF LEARNING
[ct=2720.196] FROM THE BEST, TRAVIS
[ct=2723.152] KELCE.
[ct=2723.806] AND TALKING ABOUT
[ct=2724.927] CROSBY, HE’S OUT IN
[ct=2726.316] COVERAGE.
[ct=2727.489] INBIG MAN IN THE
[ct=2728.823] MIDDLE PLANNING THE
[ct=2731.504] MAHOMES IN THE EYES
[ct=2731.671] AND GETS FULL
[ct=2733.056] COMPLETELY IN SPACE.
[ct=2733.617] >> Al: FROM THE 27
[ct=2743.534] AFTER A GAIN OF 27.
[ct=2744.061] MAHOMES, ON THE MOVE,
[ct=2744.823] SLIDES TO A STOP.
[ct=2745.998] AND MEANWHILE THE
[ct=2747.513] CROWD WANTS A FLAG
[ct=2748.859] BECAUSE YOU HAD ZACH
[ct=2749.066] CARTER COMING IN
[ct=2751.148] THERE, BUT NO FLAG.
[ct=2752.772] >> Kirk: THEY’RE DOING
[ct=2753.502] AN INTERESTING JOB
[ct=2754.941] WITH THIS DEFENSE.
[ct=2756.014] THAT TIME THEY DROPPED
[ct=2757.226] A DEFENSIVE LINEMEN.
[ct=2759.514] INSTEAD OF CROSBY, NOW
[ct=2762.088] YOU’RE SEEING TYREE
[ct=2762.088] WILSON DROP.
[ct=2764.161] A LOT OF DIFFERENT
[ct=2765.116] LOOKS, TRYING TO
[ct=2765.649] CONFUSE.
[ct=2766.284] JUST A LITTLE PUSH
[ct=2768.884] YOU SEE MAHOMES
[ct=2769.466] LIFTING HIS HANDS.
[ct=2770.163] AND OF COURSE IT’S
[ct=2772.940] CROSBY INVOLVED.
[ct=2773.539] ANY TIME, HE’S ALWAYS
[ct=2774.445] TRYING TO SEND
[ct=2775.929] MESSAGES.
[ct=2778.248] AT LEAST MORRIS
[ct=2779.602] RESPONDED BY PUSHING
[ct=2780.594] HIM OFF.
[ct=2781.393] >> Al: THAT’S HOW THE
[ct=2782.936] CROWD RESPONDS, TOO.
[ct=2784.060] ALWAYS LOOKS WORSE ON
[ct=2787.232] BIG BOARD.
[ct=2789.369] >> Kirk: IF ANYONE
[ct=2790.710] BREATHES ON MAHOMES,
[ct=2791.220] THE CROWD IS NOT GOING
[ct=2793.355] TO LIKE IT.
[ct=2795.994] >> Al: 2nd AND 10.
[ct=2796.378] MAHOMES GETS IT AWAY
[ct=2798.681] AND KNOCKED DOWN.
[ct=2801.858] KNOCKED DOWN THERE BY
[ct=2805.968] LAULU, JONAH LAULU.
[ct=2808.099] 3rd DOWN AND 10.
[ct=2809.465] >> Kirk: HOW DO YOU
[ct=2810.762] DEFEND MAHOMES?
[ct=2811.697] THE GUY HAS SEEN
[ct=2813.112] EVERYBODY USUALLY
[ct=2814.078] DROPS COVERAGE, BUT
[ct=2814.651] HOW DO YOU DROP
[ct=2816.282] COVERAGE?
[ct=2816.282] SO ANY KIND OF
[ct=2817.538] DIFFERENT WRINKLE YOU
[ct=2820.272] CAN GIVE HIM, AND
[ct=2820.448] RIGHT NOW PATRICK
[ct=2821.207] GRAHAM, THAT’S WHAT
[ct=2822.940] HE’S TRYING TO DO.
[ct=2824.472] MIXING UP LOOKS,
[ct=2825.986] TRYING TO MAKE HIM BE
[ct=2826.681] PATIENT, TRYING TO
[ct=2828.824] CONFUSE HIM WITH SOME
[ct=2830.758] OF THE MOVEMENT THEY
[ct=2832.437] HAVE ON THAT OSIVE
[ct=2833.039] LINE, WHO’S DROPPING
[ct=2835.069] INTO COVERAGE.
[ct=2836.321] >> Al: MAHOMES, CLEAN
[ct=2837.023] POCKET.
[ct=2839.178] THE BALL IS SLIPPED
[ct=2841.068] FROM KELCE.
[ct=2843.486] THAT DIDN’T TAKE LONG.
[ct=2846.248] KELCE CATCHES IT AND
[ct=2850.066] ALMOST IN ONE MOVE
[ct=2850.638] ABLE TO LADDER THE
[ct=2853.173] >> Kirk: THAT’S A NO
[ct=2853.950] LOOK, THAT’S JUST A
[ct=2855.571] THAT’S SOMETHING YOU
[ct=2856.234] MESS AROUND WITH IN
[ct=2859.597] SO COMFORTABLE ALL OF
[ct=2860.008] A SUDDEN YOU’RE ABLE
[ct=2861.100] TO UNVEIL THAT AND DO
[ct=2862.437] IT IN A GAME.
[ct=2863.409] NOT THAT HIGH RISK AT
[ct=2863.941] ALL.
[ct=2866.145] THAT BALL IS PITCHED
[ct=2869.251] PERFECTLY TO PERINE,
[ct=2870.386] AND HE GOT THAT FIRST
[ct=2871.868] DOWN YARDAGE AFTER
[ct=2873.252] THAT PITCH.
[ct=2874.613] >> Al: FROM THE 12, ON
[ct=2875.891] THE GROUND, PICKING UP
[ct=2876.719] ABOUT 4 OR 5.
[ct=2878.016] YOU SEE THE GUYS ARE
[ct=2878.967] FOOLING AROUND AND
[ct=2881.362] SCREWING AROUND IN
[ct=2881.811] PRACTICE AND SAY YOU
[ct=2882.399] KNOW WHAT, WE CAN PULL
[ct=2883.614] THIS OFF IN A GAME.
[ct=2884.954] >> Kirk: MAN, IT IS
[ct=2885.793] JUST -- IT’S ONE THING
[ct=2887.223] TO DO IT, BUT DO YOU
[ct=2889.441] HAVE TO LOOK AT SMOOTH
[ct=2890.428] WHEN YOU DO IT?
[ct=2894.098] IT’S JUST NO LOOK.
[ct=2894.502] OH, MAN.
[ct=2898.088] AND HIS BIGGEST FAN I
[ct=2898.088] THINK IS PROBABLY A
[ct=2899.300] FAN OF THAT PLAY,
[ct=2903.454] THEY DID THE SAME
[ct=2904.776] THING BACK NOVEMBER
[ct=2907.473] 4th AGAINST THE BUCS
[ct=2908.678] ON A MONDAY NIGHT
[ct=2910.158] FOOTBALL GAME.
[ct=2910.758] >> Al: RIGHT.
[ct=2912.802] 2nd AND 6.
[ct=2914.149] 3 MINUTES TO THE HALF.
[ct=2914.947] MAHOMES THROWS, THAT’S
[ct=2915.927] CAUGHT AND THEN GOING
[ct=2917.383] TO HIS KNEES AT THAT
[ct=2919.559] SPOT IS KELCE.
[ct=2920.436] FOR TRAVIS KELCE
[ct=2921.310] ALREADY THAT IS A
[ct=2924.019] TOTAL OF SIX CATCHES.
[ct=2925.366] HE HAD TEN CATCHES IN
[ct=2927.922] THEIR FIRST GAME EARLY
[ct=2930.590] IN THE SEASON WHEN THE
[ct=2931.910] CHIEFS WON 27-20.
[ct=2933.390] >> Kirk: YEAH, AND
[ct=2934.839] THIS IS THAT RED ZONE
[ct=2935.631] AREA WE TALKED ABOUT.
[ct=2936.798] THE CHIEFERIZE GOING
[ct=2937.989] TO MOVE THE BALL, MAKE
[ct=2939.178] THEM SIT BACK AND
[ct=2940.510] EXECUTE.
[ct=2942.828] WITH 2:30 TO GO IN THE
[ct=2944.146] FIRST HALF SO FAR AND
[ct=2945.348] ONLY GIVING UP 3
[ct=2946.642] POINTS AND HERE WE ARE
[ct=2951.521] AGAIN TO A THIRD DOWN
[ct=2952.078] MOMENT HERE FOR
[ct=2957.311] >> Al: PERINE THE
[ct=2961.721] >> Kirk: WE’VE SEEN
[ct=2963.626] MAHOMES AND KELCE OVER
[ct=2965.332] THE LAST HOW MANY
[ct=2966.604] YEARS, YOU KNOW.
[ct=2966.970] THEY JUST SEEM TO
[ct=2967.832] ALWAYS HAVE A FEEL.
[ct=2968.650] WATCH THE ROUTE.
[ct=2973.033] HE KNEW HE HAD A FREE
[ct=2973.212] PLAY THERE.
[ct=2973.839] I THINK WHAT’S
[ct=2974.477] INCREDIBLE SOMETIMES
[ct=2974.873] THE ROUTES ARE
[ct=2975.756] DESIGNED, AND OTHER
[ct=2977.235] TIMES IT’S KELCE
[ct=2979.147] FEELING IT AND FINDING
[ct=2980.333] THE SPACE AND MAHOMES
[ct=2980.853] TRUSTING HIM AND
[ct=2982.050] FINDING HIM, AND STILL
[ct=2984.248] THROWING IN RHYTHM.
[ct=2984.422] THE TIMING IS PERFECT.
[ct=2985.289] THEY PLAY MANNED
[ct=2987.109] HE ALWAYS GETS
[ct=2988.242] SEPARATION.
[ct=2989.545] YOU PLAY ZONE, HE
[ct=2990.318] FINDS THE VOID IN THE
[ct=2995.246] ZONE, AND THAT TIME HE
[ct=2995.660] JUST IMP PROVISES AND
[ct=2996.308] MAKES THE PLAY TO GET
[ct=2998.680] THAT FIRST DOWN DEEPER
[ct=3001.242] IN RED TERRITORY.
[ct=3003.432] >> Al: SO 3rd AND 4.
[ct=3003.818] MAHOMES HIT AS HE
[ct=3006.311] THROWS, AND IN THE END
[ct=3011.869] TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=3019.152] >> Kirk: THIS IS -- I
[ct=3020.821] TOLD YOU IN A MEETING
[ct=3021.255] IT’S LIKE YOU RUN OUT
[ct=3022.459] OF THINGS TO SAY WHEN
[ct=3026.389] TIGER WOODS WAS IN HIS
[ct=3027.774] PRIME.
[ct=3029.139] THAT’S WHERE WE ARE
[ct=3030.966] WITH MAHOMES.
[ct=3031.485] HE IS ACCURATE.
[ct=3031.660] WHAT ARE WE WORRIED
[ct=3033.174] ABOUT WITH MAHOMES?
[ct=3033.541] THE CONCERN WITH THE
[ct=3034.478] LEFT TACKLE.
[ct=3035.559] AS HE’S HIT, HE’S ABLE
[ct=3036.389] TO MAKE THAT THROW
[ct=3037.263] ALMOST AGAINST HIS
[ct=3038.115] BODY, AND LOOK AT THAT
[ct=3038.880] LOCATION WITH THAT
[ct=3039.874] FOOTBALL AND A HECK OF
[ct=3040.954] A JOB ON THE BACK END
[ct=3043.066] BY WATSON TRYING TO
[ct=3043.808] SECURE THAT AS JONES
[ct=3045.616] KNOCKS AWAY THAT
[ct=3047.125] >> Al: EXTRA POINT BY
[ct=3048.821] WRIGHT, HISTORY MADE
[ct=3050.712] 238 REGULAR SEASON
[ct=3051.970] TOUCHDOWN PASSES FOR
[ct=3054.021] THAT MAN, ECLIPSING
[ct=3060.643] THE MARK HELD BY L
[ct=3061.997] LIN DAWSON.
[ct=3062.545] MAHOMES AND THE CHIEFS
[ct=3065.986] ON TOP.
[ct=3065.986] >> Kirk: WHAT’D YOU
[ct=3067.317] SAY MAHOMES OVER THERE
[ct=3071.276] LIKE ALL RIGHT.
[ct=3071.276] >> Al: THE GREAT

[ct=3073.232] QUARTERBACK FOR THIS
[ct=3075.246] TEAM BACK IN THE FIRST
[ct=3077.126] SUPER BOWL FOLLOWING
[ct=3079.208] THE 1966 SEASON.
[ct=3079.442] WITH MAHOMES, YOU JUST
[ct=3080.736] GET THE FEELING HEY
[ct=3082.474] WHATEVER IT IS,
[ct=3083.048] WHEREVER WE ARE -- I
[ct=3084.243] MEAN THIS YEAR IN
[ct=3084.767] PARTICULAR BUT FIVE
[ct=3088.070] GAMES HAVE GONE DOWN
[ct=3088.952] TO THE LAST PLAY.
[ct=3090.254] >> Kirk: LAST PLAY.
[ct=3091.632] EIGHT ONE-POSSESSION
[ct=3093.324] LOOK AT THAT, ALMOST
[ct=3093.935] AGAINST HIS BODY.
[ct=3094.997] AND LOOK AT THE
[ct=3096.970] AGAIN, JONES PLAYS
[ct=3097.319] THAT FOOTBALL.
[ct=3098.219] HE DOESN’T GIVE UP ON
[ct=3099.925] WATSON, AGAIN,
[ct=3100.883] DESERVES A LOT OF
[ct=3101.674] CREDIT FOR BEING ABLE
[ct=3103.796] TO HOLD ONTO THAT
[ct=3103.796] FOOTBALL BECAUSE HE
[ct=3105.292] GOT THAT RIGHT HAND IN
[ct=3106.847] THERE TO SEPARATE.
[ct=3107.434] ANTONIO PIERCE CALLED
[ct=3109.140] THE TIMEOUT WITH GREAT
[ct=3110.635] UNDERSTANDING.
[ct=3110.997] STILL HAVE THE
[ct=3111.911] 2-MINUTE WARNING,
[ct=3117.262] TWOTIMEOUTS.
[ct=3118.359] FIELD GOAL RANGE AND
[ct=3119.650] TRY TO GET THE SECOND
[ct=3122.688] HALF.
[ct=3123.920] >> Al: AND HE’LL BRING
[ct=3125.034] IT OUT TO THE 19 YARD
[ct=3127.342] AND START FROM THERE.
[ct=3128.965] >> Kirk: STUFF LIKE
[ct=3130.234] THAT WE ASK ABOUT --
[ct=3131.169] WE ASK ABOUT WHAT
[ct=3132.907] MAKES HIM SO GREAT.
[ct=3132.907] THAT’S IT.
[ct=3134.232] ON THE SIDELINE AFTER
[ct=3135.779] A TOUCHDOWN TALKING TO
[ct=3137.010] THE LINEMEN, TALKING
[ct=3137.819] TO RECEIVERS, TALKING
[ct=3140.301] TO THE BACKS.
[ct=3140.660] I MEAN, THAT’S --
[ct=3141.850] THAT’S KIND OF THAT
[ct=3142.639] SECRET SAUCE.
[ct=3143.545] IT’S NOT JUST THE
[ct=3144.708] EXECUTION ON THE FIELD
[ct=3145.655] WE ALL MARVEL AT.
[ct=3146.978] IT’S WHAT HE DOES IN
[ct=3148.241] THE LOCKER ROOM, WHAT
[ct=3148.604] HE DOES ON THE
[ct=3150.316] SIDELINES, HOW HE
[ct=3152.787] COMMUNICATES.
[ct=3153.954] MATT NAGY THERE WITH
[ct=3155.674] THEY NEVER STOP.
[ct=3157.952] IT’S NEVER ENOUGH WITH
[ct=3159.730] >> Al: IT’S THE
[ct=3162.112] ALL-TIME LOVE AFFAIR
[ct=3163.227] IN THIS TOWN, TOO.
[ct=3163.814] SO GREAT IN THE
[ct=3164.737] COMMUNITY ON EVERY
[ct=3165.767] LEVEL AS THE RAIDERS
[ct=3167.471] NOW TRY TO CUT INTO
[ct=3168.963] THE LEAD BEFORE HALF
[ct=3171.100] TO THE 35 YARD LINE
[ct=3172.160] GOES McCORMICK, AND
[ct=3172.759] THAT’S GOING TO TAKE
[ct=3174.414] US TO THE 2-MINUTE
[ct=3175.755] WARNING.
[ct=3176.905] SO THE RAIDERS STILL
[ct=3179.595] HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS.
[ct=3180.172] 2 MINUTES TO THE
[ct=3193.040] >> Al: AERIAL COVERAGE
[ct=3199.508] IS PRESENTED BY ROYAL
[ct=3199.866] CARIBBEAN.
[ct=3200.561] CHIEFS ON TOP BY A
[ct=3202.003] SCORE OF 10-3.
[ct=3202.751] IT’LL BE FIRST DOWN
[ct=3205.208] FOR THE RAIDERS FROM
[ct=3212.238] THE 35 YARD LINE.
[ct=3215.940] O’CONNELL 8 OF 11 FROM
[ct=3219.328] 108 YARDS.
[ct=3220.089] GOING AROUND IS
[ct=3224.257] TUCKER.
[ct=3224.803] TUCKER DIVING, AND HAS
[ct=3227.290] IT’S 11.
[ct=3228.376] >> Kirk: YEAH, THEY’VE
[ct=3228.946] BEEN RUNNING THE
[ct=3229.387] FOOTBALL BETWEEN THE
[ct=3230.899] TACKLES.
[ct=3231.061] WE TALKED ABOUT THAT’S
[ct=3232.526] ONE OF IT CHANGES WITH
[ct=3233.336] SCOTT TURNER, GETTING
[ct=3234.337] THE BALL DOWNHILL.
[ct=3235.155] I’LL TELL YOU,
[ct=3236.203] McCORMICK IS DOING A
[ct=3237.108] HECK OF A JOB WHEN
[ct=3239.722] HE’S IN THERE GETTING
[ct=3240.063] SOME PHYSICAL RUNNING.
[ct=3241.167] THAT TIME WHEN YOU CAN
[ct=3242.111] RUN INSIDE, YOU START
[ct=3242.883] TO LULL
[ct=3245.332] INTO THINKING IT’S
[ct=3246.234] MORE IN THE INTERIOR,
[ct=3249.351] AND YOU CAN GET THAT
[ct=3249.952] JETS SWEEP GOING
[ct=3250.970] AROUND THE EDGE THERE.
[ct=3251.979] >> Al: SO THE WORST
[ct=3253.318] RUSHING TEAM IN THE
[ct=3253.925] LEAGUE HAS 57 YARDS ON
[ct=3255.462] THE GROUND, AVERAGING
[ct=3260.428] 5.7 PER CARRY.
[ct=3260.428] O’CONNELL DOWN THE
[ct=3263.255] THAT’S BROKEN UP.
[ct=3265.120] D.J. TURNER.
[ct=3266.754] IT’S INTERESTING.
[ct=3268.795] YOU LOOK AT SOME OF
[ct=3269.203] THESE NUMBERS, 57
[ct=3271.591] YARDS ON THE GROUND
[ct=3274.157] FOR LAS VEGAS, 10 WITH
[ct=3279.501] MEANWHILE, THERE THEY
[ct=3282.557] ARE TRYING TO WORK OFF
[ct=3284.905] THE TRIFTOFAN
[ct=3285.173] HANGOVER.
[ct=3289.145] OUR GANG THERE.
[ct=3289.529] I GOT YOU, RICHARD.
[ct=3290.818] BUT YOU KNOW I’M
[ct=3292.028] RIGHT.
[ct=3293.525] STATEFARM HALF TIME
[ct=3294.307] SHOW COMING UP.
[ct=3300.814] 2nd AND 10.
[ct=3302.477] ON THE GROUND.
[ct=3305.692] FINDS NONE.
[ct=3308.783] 3rd DOWN.
[ct=3311.030] AND TIMEOUT TAKEN
[ct=3313.695] >> Kirk: JUST BECAUSE,
[ct=3313.695] YOU KNOW, PEOPLE GET
[ct=3316.361] ANALYTICS AND THE
[ct=3317.673] STATS, AND YOU THINK
[ct=3318.441] ABOUT THIS TEAM.
[ct=3319.201] YOU SAID THEY’RE DEAD
[ct=3319.821] LAST IN THE NFL.
[ct=3320.683] YOU HAVE TO RUN THE
[ct=3322.414] MAHOMES HAS 10 YARDS
[ct=3322.909] RUSHING.
[ct=3324.058] IT’S THE FEWEST YARDS
[ct=3324.655] RUSHING IN
[ct=3330.158] >> Al: 10-3.
[ct=3332.768] KC ON TOP, 3rd DOWN
[ct=3334.115] AND 9 NOW.
[ct=3334.501] ABDULLAH IN THE
[ct=3336.728] BACKFIELD.
[ct=3337.319] MEYERS SETS UP IN THE
[ct=3339.695] SLOT TO THE LEFT SIDE.
[ct=3342.069] PLENTY OF TIME ON THE
[ct=3344.701] PLAY CLOCK.
[ct=3346.056] UNDER HEAT.
[ct=3348.713] DOWN HE GOES.
[ct=3348.872] CHRIS JONES, WHO
[ct=3352.250] HADN’T HAD A SACK IN
[ct=3353.366] TWO MONTHS WITH TWO
[ct=3355.556] TODAY.
[ct=3355.556] >> Kirk: I ALWAYS FIND
[ct=3356.201] IT INTERESTING.
[ct=3357.030] WE TALK WITH CHRIS
[ct=3359.491] JONES, SUCH A
[ct=3359.684] INTERESTING GUY TO
[ct=3361.064] TALK TO, AND HE ALWAYS
[ct=3363.327] TELLS US, YOU KNOW, ON
[ct=3364.386] THIRD DOWN -- HOW
[ct=3365.323] ABOUT THAT GET OFF?
[ct=3366.097] HE GOES I TRY TO
[ct=3366.661] ALMOST FIND THE
[ct=3367.944] VICTIM.
[ct=3370.752] LIKE WHO AM I FEELING?
[ct=3373.090] WHO BASED ON MY FILM
[ct=3374.182] STUDY, DO I WANT TO GO
[ct=3375.732] AFTER ON THIRD DOWN.
[ct=3376.709] HERE HE GOES AFTER THE
[ct=3380.048] GLAZE, GETS HIM OFF
[ct=3382.689] BALANCE, GETS HIM
[ct=3382.876] LEANING AND WINS OFF
[ct=3383.479] THAT RIGHT EDGE.
[ct=3384.101] AGAIN, I THINK THE
[ct=3384.994] QUARTERBACK THAT TIME
[ct=3386.146] I THINK HE’S SURPRISED
[ct=3388.359] BY HOW QUICKLY BIG 95
[ct=3389.620] GOT TO HIM.
[ct=3389.620] >> Al: YEAH.
[ct=3390.955] AND THE SNAP DIDN’T
[ct=3391.120] HELP EITHER.
[ct=3392.339] OFF TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=3395.233] COLE TO PUNT.
[ct=3398.822] HARDMAN SETS UP AT HIS
[ct=3406.834] OWN 10.
[ct=3406.997] ANGLED KICK TOWARD THE
[ct=3408.370] NEAR SIDE.
[ct=3409.439] IT’LL GO OUT OF
[ct=3410.828] BOUNDS, AND THEY WILL
[ct=3412.315] MARK THAT ONE
[ct=3413.425] SOMEWHERE AROUND THE
[ct=3417.442] 16 YARD LINE OR THE 15
[ct=3420.057] YARD LINE, AND A FLAG
[ct=3423.979] IS DOWN ON THE PLAY AS
[ct=3428.159] WELL.
[ct=3444.826] >> Referee: PLAYER OUT
[ct=3446.733] OF BOUNDS ON A KICK.
[ct=3447.079] LAS VEGAS NUMBER 34.
[ct=3448.630] KANSAS CITY WILL
[ct=3449.868] TACKLE ON THE 5 YARD
[ct=3450.744] PENALTY ON THE END OF
[ct=3452.411] IT PLAY.
[ct=3453.781] IT’S FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3456.798] EXACTLY ONE MINUTE TO
[ct=3459.035] >> Al: SO NEXT WEEK
[ct=3459.568] THURSDAY NIGHT
[ct=3459.964] FOOTBALL AND WE’VE GOT
[ct=3461.396] A BEAUTY ON PRIME.
[ct=3463.374] NEXT THURSDAY NIGHT
[ct=3468.673] GREEN BAY, 9-3 AGAINST
[ct=3475.424] THE LIONS, 11-1.
[ct=3475.990] >> Kirk: THAT’S A GOOD
[ct=3476.892] ONE.
[ct=3477.997] CANNOT WAIT.
[ct=3479.034] BOTH OF THESE TEAMS
[ct=3481.174] YESTERDAY DOMINANT.
[ct=3482.621] >> Al: SO COMING UP IN
[ct=3485.515] SIX NIGHTS AS WE START
[ct=3487.299] WEEK 14.
[ct=3487.708] MEANWHILE, MAHOMES
[ct=3488.863] WITH A MINUTE TO GO
[ct=3491.475] GETS SMOTHERED HERE.
[ct=3492.805] SO PRESSURE PUT ON.
[ct=3493.221] WHISTLED THAT SECOND
[ct=3495.181] BROUGHT EVERYBODY THAT
[ct=3497.148] ROLLED THE DICE ON 1st
[ct=3498.125] AND 10.
[ct=3500.032] I THINK THEY’RE A
[ct=3500.540] LITTLE BIT FRUSTRATED
[ct=3502.189] THAT LAST TRY SEEING
[ct=3503.065] MAHOMES HAVING SO MUCH
[ct=3503.810] TIME TO THROW THE
[ct=3506.719] THIS TIME THEY DIAL IT
[ct=3507.573] UP, GET TO HIM, GET IT
[ct=3510.727] BEHIND THE STICKS.
[ct=3511.083] I THINK AFTER THAT
[ct=3511.298] PLAY THEY’RE
[ct=3511.827] COMFORTABLE WITH
[ct=3512.230] KILLING THE CLOCK
[ct=3515.462] ONE TIMEOUT.
[ct=3519.037] THEY’RE IN NO HURRY
[ct=3521.312] A LITTLE SHOULDER
[ct=3522.997] SHAKE.
[ct=3524.346] AND PASS, WIDE OPEN.
[ct=3526.941] HOPKINS TO THE 50 YARD
[ct=3528.791] LINE, AND NOW THEY’LL
[ct=3529.369] TAKE THEIR TIMEOUT.
[ct=3531.059] I WAS A LITTLE
[ct=3531.492] SURPRISED BECAUSE THIS
[ct=3532.290] TEAM DOESN’T MATTER
[ct=3533.959] WHERE THEY ARE, COULD
[ct=3544.588] BE WHENEVER AND
[ct=3545.005] WHATEVER IN TERMS OF
[ct=3545.305] DISTANCE, AND LET THE
[ct=3545.932] CLOCK RUN AND NOW THEY
[ct=3546.281] STOP IT AT 18.
[ct=3550.711] >> Kirk: SEE THAT BIG
[ct=3551.177] HOLE THERE BETWEEN THE
[ct=3553.090] CORNER AND THE SAFETY?
[ct=3554.263] THE SAFETY’S SO SLOW
[ct=3555.703] IN GETTING OVER,
[ct=3558.226] THINK HIS EYES WERE IN
[ct=3558.599] THE BACK FIELD JUST
[ct=3560.809] KIND OF STARING AT
[ct=3561.246] MAHOMES AND WAITING TO
[ct=3562.346] MAKE A DECISION, BUT
[ct=3563.055] HE WAITS UNTIL THE
[ct=3564.018] BALL’S IN THE AIR.
[ct=3565.188] AND BY THEN IT’S JUST
[ct=3567.276] TOO LATE.
[ct=3567.903] >> Al: THERE’S WRIGHT
[ct=3570.094] WHO WAS PICKED UP OFF
[ct=3571.177] THE STREET.
[ct=3572.329] LAST WEEK YOU GOT ONE
[ct=3573.834] TIMEOUT, FIRST DOWN AT
[ct=3576.467] THE 50, GRAY COMING
[ct=3576.467] INTO MOTION ON THE
[ct=3577.832] INSIDE, MAHOMES WITH A
[ct=3579.089] DEEP DROP, SURVEYING,
[ct=3580.226] FIRES.
[ct=3580.446] OVER THE MIDDLE AND
[ct=3581.780] CAUGHT AT THE 40 YARD
[ct=3583.235] LINE BY NOAH GRAY.
[ct=3586.936] NOW THEY’VE GOT TO GET
[ct=3588.873] UP THERE IN A HURRY
[ct=3590.905] BECAUSE -- MEANWHILE,
[ct=3593.548] YOU’VE GOT A PENALTY
[ct=3596.238] WHAT DO YOU GOT HERE?
[ct=3596.635] >> Kirk: MAXX CROSBY
[ct=3597.853] JUST GOT -- YOU TALK
[ct=3598.860] ABOUT WHAT HE HAS TO
[ct=3600.759] DEAL WITH, TRIPLE TEAM
[ct=3603.233] ON THAT PLAY.
[ct=3607.212] YOU’VE GOT A WHISTLE.
[ct=3607.647] COULDN’T HAVE TAKEN A
[ct=3614.270] CONVERSATION GOING ON
[ct=3618.246] TELL US BE QUIET.
[ct=3618.801] IT’S GREAT.
[ct=3630.672] >> Kirk: HUSH.
[ct=3631.250] >> Al: ALL RIGHT, YOU
[ct=3636.841] TELL ME.
[ct=3638.987] EVEN TERRY IS LOOKING
[ct=3640.132] ON FROM STANFORD
[ct=3641.738] QUIZZICALLY.
[ct=3642.234] >> Kirk: YOU HAD TWO
[ct=3642.957] DIFFERENT CALLS.
[ct=3643.821] ONE GUY SAYING
[ct=3644.638] INCOMPLETE, THE OTHER
[ct=3646.458] GUY SAYING CATCH.
[ct=3647.069] >> Referee: AFTER
[ct=3648.120] EXPEDITED REVIEW IT
[ct=3648.621] WAS A CATCH.
[ct=3650.127] HE WAS DOWN BY CONTACT
[ct=3651.424] WITH 14 SECONDS.
[ct=3652.480] BY RULE THIS DOES
[ct=3655.480] REQUIRE A 10-SECOND
[ct=3655.480] RUNOFF.
[ct=3657.466] RESET THE GAME CLOCK
[ct=3659.025] TO 4 SECONDS.
[ct=3660.380] 4 SECONDS ON THE GAME
[ct=3662.242] CLOCK, PLEASE.
[ct=3666.219] 4 SECONDS.
[ct=3666.397] >> Al: IF THAT’S AN
[ct=3668.875] EXPEDITED REVIEW, I’M
[ct=3672.301] AN ASTRONAUT.
[ct=3674.341] >> Kirk: REPLAY CAME
[ct=3675.707] IN AND REVERSED THAT
[ct=3676.822] TO BE ABLE TO MAKE
[ct=3677.520] THAT A CATCH FOR THE
[ct=3679.408] MAHOMES IS GOING TO
[ct=3681.455] KILL THE CLOCK HERE.
[ct=3683.616] AND THEN SETUP A FIELD
[ct=3690.021] CROWD IS BEFUDDLED AS
[ct=3694.857] >> Kirk: WELL, IT
[ct=3695.926] REVERSES IT TO A
[ct=3696.668] RUNNING CLOCK, AND
[ct=3697.438] THAT’S WHY THE
[ct=3700.425] 10-SECOND RUNOFF.
[ct=3702.992] SO NOW YOU’VE GOT A
[ct=3704.726] 59-YARD FIELD GOAL.
[ct=3705.555] >> Kirk: WELCOME IN,
[ct=3707.726] KID, HERE YOU GO.
[ct=3708.872] >> Al: HERE YOU GO,
[ct=3712.701] MATTHEW WRIGHT, WHO’S
[ct=3713.688] BEEN AROUND FOR SIX
[ct=3715.496] HE HAS SIGNED ON
[ct=3716.640] PRACTICE SQUADS OR
[ct=3718.228] ROSTERS 15 DIFFERENT
[ct=3719.278] TIMES.
[ct=3721.046] AND THIS KICK IS
[ct=3723.640] IT’S GOING TO BE RUN
[ct=3725.279] BACK FROM THE END ZONE
[ct=3729.154] BUT NOT VERY FAR.
[ct=3729.322] WELL, THAT IS THE WAY
[ct=3731.431] THE HALF ENDS.
[ct=3732.291] CROWD DIDN’T LIKE THE
[ct=3734.957] WAY IT ENDED.
[ct=3737.083] BUT PER USUAL, THEY
[ct=3741.302] HAVE THE LEAD.
[ct=3741.480] 10-3.
[ct=3742.920] KELCE BIG HALF.
[ct=3745.616] SIX CATCHES, 63 YARDS.
[ct=3748.848] MAHOMES WITH 15-24,
[ct=3749.887] 192.
[ct=3750.990] WE GO TO KAYLEE.
[ct=3753.849] >> COACH, YOU’VE GOT
[ct=3754.338] SOME POINTS ON THE
[ct=3754.650] BOARD.
[ct=3755.129] WHERE DO YOU WANT TO
[ct=3756.361] IMPROVE THE SECOND
[ct=3758.378] >> WE CAN’T TAKE A
[ct=3759.042] STEP BACKWARDS.
[ct=3761.687] PENALTIES.
[ct=3763.936] HAD A COUPLE SACKS IN
[ct=3765.474] DEFENSIVELY GOT TO
[ct=3771.070] KEEP THE BECAUSE OF HOW
[ct=3771.269] DECISIVE HE CAN BE.
[ct=3772.493] WE’LL SEE IF HE CAN DO
[ct=3773.200] THAT HERE IN THE
[ct=3778.213] SECOND HALF.
[ct=3778.769] >> Al: AND HE’S ONLY
[ct=3780.262] UTILIZED TWO
[ct=3782.093] RECEIVERS.
[ct=3782.531] KICK WILL COME DOWN TO
[ct=3784.421] THE 3 YARD LINE.
[ct=3784.666] TURNER STEPPED IN
[ct=3785.543] FRONT OF HIS MATE
[ct=3786.683] RIGHT THERE AND GETS
[ct=3789.402] SPILLED UP AT THE 20.
[ct=3789.878] >> Kirk: WELL, I THINK
[ct=3795.114] THE ONE QUESTION WE
[ct=3795.538] CAME IN THIS WEEK WAS
[ct=3795.982] AIDAN O’CONNELL COMING
[ct=3796.463] OFF THAT THUMB SURGERY
[ct=3797.384] ON HIS THROWING HAND.
[ct=3798.509] HOW WOULD IT HOLD UP?
[ct=3799.705] THERE’S BEEN AN ISSUE
[ct=3800.076] AT ALL.
[ct=3800.947] THE BALL HAS COME OUT
[ct=3801.540] CLEAN.
[ct=3802.347] THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS
[ct=3803.795] BEING ABLE TO SLOW
[ct=3804.671] DOWN CHRIS JONES.
[ct=3806.056] BUT THAT RIGHT THUMB
[ct=3806.903] LOOKS GOOD.
[ct=3809.013] REALLY, REALLY STRONG,
[ct=3809.827] AND I DON’T THINK THE
[ct=3810.925] BALL’S SLIPPED OUT OF
[ct=3812.209] I DON’T THINK HE’S HAD
[ct=3812.877] ANY ISSUES WITH HIS
[ct=3813.480] GRIP.
[ct=3814.138] I THINK RIGHT NOW HE’S
[ct=3815.525] FOCUSED ON TRYING TO
[ct=3817.296] SLOW DOWN THAT PASS
[ct=3819.951] RUSH AND CONTINUING TO
[ct=3823.066] GIVE HIM TIME TO FIND
[ct=3824.247] MEYERS AND BROCK
[ct=3827.944] >> Al: FROM THE 25 ON
[ct=3829.303] THIS CLOUDLESS
[ct=3830.610] 37-DEGREE AFTERNOON.
[ct=3831.958] PLAY ACTION, GOOD
[ct=3833.339] PASS IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=3834.675] TURNER IN THE AREA,
[ct=3835.690] HAD Ph.D.ERS CUTTING
[ct=3836.744] ACROSS.
[ct=3844.356] 2 PD Dnd DOWN AND 10.
[ct=3846.352] >> Kirk: SHOULD
[ct=3849.627] MENTION NAZEEH
[ct=3852.571] JOHNSON.
[ct=3855.400] THEY STILL HAVE JAYDEN
[ct=3857.331] OUT WITH A BACK
[ct=3857.910] INJURY.
[ct=3859.190] HE’S BEEN A MAJORITY
[ct=3860.570] OF THE GAME, 13.
[ct=3861.881] HE’S HEALTHY AND HE IS
[ct=3862.440] FOR NOW ON THE BENCH
[ct=3864.663] AND HAS BEEN FOR MOST
[ct=3866.844] OF THIS GAME.
[ct=3868.790] A LITTLE TOSS BACK
[ct=3869.836] ON THE GROUND AND
[ct=3871.016] PICKING UP A FIRST
[ct=3874.109] DOWN, A GAIN OF 11 IS
[ct=3876.692] SO, AGAIN, THE TEAM
[ct=3877.616] THAT IS WORST IN THE
[ct=3879.679] LEAGUE IN RUSHING JUST
[ct=3880.428] ABOUT WITH THEIR PER
[ct=3882.477] GAME AVERAGE ALREADY
[ct=3882.911] RIGHT NOW.
[ct=3883.588] >> Kirk: THEY ARE
[ct=3885.613] MIXING UP THEIR LOOKS.
[ct=3886.070] ANTONIO PIERCE HAS TO
[ct=3887.545] BE VERY PROUD OF WHAT
[ct=3889.334] SCOTT TURNER AND NORV
[ct=3890.141] TURNER ARE DOING.
[ct=3891.811] A LOT OF INTERIOR RUN.
[ct=3893.307] THIS TIME THEY GET
[ct=3894.442] ABDULLAH OUTSIDE WHERE
[ct=3895.452] HE’S GOT SOME
[ct=3896.397] QUICKNESS AND GOOD
[ct=3896.881] BLOCKING THAT TIME ON
[ct=3900.919] THE EDGE TO GET HIM
[ct=3905.458] DOWNHILL.
[ct=3914.645] THROWING IN THAT
[ct=3915.961] DIRECTION, INCOMPLETE.
[ct=3916.823] COVERAGE IS GOOD RIGHT
[ct=3919.340] YOU’VE GOT JUSTIN REED
[ct=3920.348] TAKING CARE OF BROCK
[ct=3924.178] IT’LL BE 2nd DOWN AND
[ct=3930.843] >> Kirk: JUSTIN REID
[ct=3933.293] KNOCKED JAKOBI MEYERS
[ct=3934.660] OUT.
[ct=3935.961] NOW LOOK AT REID ON
[ct=3939.132] COVERAGE ON BOWERS.
[ct=3939.593] WHAT A JOB BY THE
[ct=3940.086] VETERAN.
[ct=3940.882] TAKES ONE GUY OUT BY
[ct=3942.157] THROWING THAT SHOULDER
[ct=3942.732] AND GETS OUT IN
[ct=3943.671] COVERAGE AND TAKES THE
[ct=3944.970] ROOKIE OUT.
[ct=3946.881] TWO FOR ONE FOR THE
[ct=3947.077] SAFETY.
[ct=3948.094] >> Al: DOUBLE DUTY FOR
[ct=3950.099] REID SEVENTH YEAR IN
[ct=3950.647] THE LEAGUE.
[ct=3951.885] CAME OVER A COUPLE OF
[ct=3953.253] YEARS AGO FROM THE
[ct=3955.240] TEXANS.
[ct=3955.851] TURNER THE MAN IN
[ct=3957.563] MOTION, COMING BACK
[ct=3958.766] THE OTHER WAY.
[ct=3959.150] HE TAKES THE PASS.
[ct=3961.889] DOWN THE SIDELINE HE
[ct=3963.590] INTO KANSAS CITY
[ct=3964.550] TERRITORY.
[ct=3965.642] ALL THE WAY TO THE 39
[ct=3967.649] YARD LINE GOES D.J.
[ct=3970.105] TURNER.
[ct=3970.690] >> Kirk: THIS IS ALL
[ct=3971.486] ON THE QUARTERBACK
[ct=3978.269] BECAUSE HE SAW THAT
[ct=3980.921] SPAGS LIKES TO
[ct=3981.348] OVERHAUL.
[ct=3982.869] AND GET THE BALL TO
[ct=3984.815] THE OUTSIDE TO TURNER,
[ct=3985.387] AND NOW IT’S
[ct=3987.862] ONE-ON-ONE OUT THERE.
[ct=3988.591] MAKE ONE MAN MISS AND
[ct=3991.821] THERE’S NO ONE LEFT.
[ct=3993.156] GREAT JOB BY AIDAN
[ct=3993.335] O’CONNELL RECOGNIZING
[ct=3993.754] THE PRESSURE AND
[ct=3995.296] GETTING THE BALL OUT
[ct=3998.422] >> Al: A GUY WHO
[ct=3999.656] SCORED A TOUCHDOWN IN
[ct=4001.992] THE 27-20 LOSS BACK IN
[ct=4003.000] VEGAS EARLIER THIS
[ct=4006.355] SEASON.
[ct=4006.355] KEEPING ON THE GROUND,
[ct=4009.233] SPINNING AROUND,
[ct=4009.233] ABDULLAH PICKS UP
[ct=4010.077] ABOUT 4.
[ct=4010.900] NICK BOLTON IN ON THE
[ct=4012.596] >> Kirk: THINK ABOUT
[ct=4013.080] PLAYING IN THIS
[ct=4013.933] DIVISION IN THE AFC
[ct=4015.115] WEST WHERE YOU’VE GOT
[ct=4016.013] HERBERT WITH THE
[ct=4017.515] CHARGERS, OBVIOUSLY
[ct=4027.460] WHAT BO NIX IS DOING.
[ct=4027.460] YOU TURN ON THE GAME
[ct=4030.250] IN THE NFL YOU CAN
[ct=4030.762] RIGHT AWAY WHO HAS A
[ct=4031.154] CHANCE AND WHO
[ct=4031.574] DOESN’T.
[ct=4031.911] IF YOU
[ct=4034.256] SAQUARTERBACK, YOU’VE
[ct=4034.414] GOT NO SHOT.
[ct=4035.703] AIDESEN O’CONNELL JUST
[ct=4038.260] GIVES THIS OFFENSE, IN
[ct=4038.673] MY OPINION, A
[ct=4039.641] DIFFERENT FEEL WITH
[ct=4039.814] HIM OUT THERE IN
[ct=4041.152] COMMAND.
[ct=4041.556] >> Al: THERE WAS A
[ct=4043.548] WALK ON AND PURDUE
[ct=4046.851] ENDED UP SPENDING SIX
[ct=4048.818] YEARS IN LAFAYETTE.
[ct=4049.489] HAS TIME AND IT’S
[ct=4052.201] A LOT OF RED SHIRTS
[ct=4053.423] AROUND NUMBER 16,
[ct=4056.637] >> Kirk: WHAT A PLAY.
[ct=4057.513] WE JUST TALKED ABOUT
[ct=4063.122] HOW JOSHUA WILLIAMS IS
[ct=4068.623] IN FOR NAZEEH JOHNSON.
[ct=4069.964] CAME OUT OF NOWHERE,
[ct=4071.082] SEE RIGHT HERE.
[ct=4071.706] HE’S IN POSITION
[ct=4072.488] PLAYING MATCH
[ct=4075.050] GIVES UP ON ONE
[ct=4075.684] RECEIVER WHO LEAVES
[ct=4076.405] HIS AREA AND FINDS
[ct=4077.758] JAKOBI MEYERS COMING
[ct=4077.926] OVER FROM THE OTHER
[ct=4079.775] REALLY GOOD VISION
[ct=4081.954] THAT TIME BY JOSHUA
[ct=4083.736] WILLIAMS.
[ct=4087.227] >> Al: 3rd DOWN 5.
[ct=4088.607] RUN IT.
[ct=4092.562] AND PICK UP THE FIRST,
[ct=4095.226] >> Kirk: WHAT A CALL.
[ct=4096.555] WHAT A CALL.
[ct=4099.256] JORDAN MEREDITH,
[ct=4101.090] KOLTON MILLER THE LEFT
[ct=4101.287] SIDE, THEY GET A
[ct=4101.683] DOUBLE-TEAM.
[ct=4102.114] I DON’T THINK THE
[ct=4102.626] CHIEFS WERE EXPECTING
[ct=4103.249] THIS AT ALL.
[ct=4104.499] THE ONLY GUY THERE IS
[ct=4108.834] THE LINEBACKER NICK
[ct=4110.447] THEY GET BOLTON RIGHT
[ct=4111.265] THERE AND THAT’S
[ct=4113.575] REALLY THE MAIN BLOCK
[ct=4115.143] THEY HAD TO MAKE.
[ct=4116.185] ONCE THEY GET THE
[ct=4118.947] LINEBACKER YOU SEE
[ct=4119.430] THEY DOUBLE-TEAM HIM.
[ct=4119.804] I THOUGHT THEY’D PICK
[ct=4121.709] THAT UP EASILY.
[ct=4122.405] >> Al: YEAH, I DID,
[ct=4122.912] TOO.
[ct=4124.218] YOU SEE PIERCE GOING
[ct=4125.262] COME ON, MAN, HE GOT
[ct=4127.986] BUT NOW IT’S
[ct=4131.260] 4th AND 1.
[ct=4133.792] AND -- AND NO.
[ct=4140.878] BOLTON IS THERE.
[ct=4144.761] SO AFTER ALL THAT, I’M
[ct=4146.363] JUST WONDERING IF THAT
[ct=4146.819] WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO
[ct=4148.668] CALL FOR A CHALLENGE.
[ct=4151.389] >> Kirk: I MEAN --
[ct=4153.996] >> Al: THE FIRST ONE.
[ct=4153.996] >> Kirk: I THOUGHT AT
[ct=4154.937] THE VERY LEAST THEY
[ct=4155.547] WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT
[ct=4157.513] ANTONIO PIERCE HAD
[ct=4158.757] THAT LOOK OF ANGUISH
[ct=4159.918] LIKE YOU SAID, YOU’VE
[ct=4160.693] GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.
[ct=4162.034] AND THEN YOU GET INTO
[ct=4164.221] AN OBVIOUS SHORT YARD
[ct=4164.886] SITUATION WITH CHRIS
[ct=4165.374] JONES AND
[ct=4169.198] >> Al: THEY GOT IT
[ct=4170.167] GO BACK TO THE THIRD
[ct=4170.981] DOWN-PLAY.
[ct=4172.800] WITH THE NAKED EYE IT
[ct=4173.498] LOOKED LIKE THE FIRST
[ct=4175.000] DOWN WAS SECURED.
[ct=4176.991] >> Kirk: THEY RECALL
[ct=4177.235] ALL OVER IT.
[ct=4178.395] >> Al: THE KNEE COMES
[ct=4179.799] DOWN HERE AND THERE’S
[ct=4181.779] THE KNEE, THERE’S THE
[ct=4182.506] BALL, WHICH IS CLEARLY
[ct=4184.203] ABOUT A HALF YARD SHY.
[ct=4184.770] >> Kirk: WATCH THE
[ct=4192.944] INTERIOR BY NADY AND
[ct=4197.895] CHRIS JONES.
[ct=4198.601] >> Al: CHIEFS NOW
[ct=4199.556] START FROM THE 30 YARD
[ct=4204.475] WITHOUT STANDING
[ct=4204.839] PROTECTION THE PASS IS
[ct=4207.356] KELCE WAS THE INTENDED
[ct=4208.490] RECEIVER OVER THE
[ct=4212.464] >> Kirk: FIRST TIME
[ct=4213.254] WE’VE SEEN MAHOMES AND
[ct=4220.447] KELCE NOT ON THE SAME
[ct=4221.930] PAGE.
[ct=4222.677] LOOK HOW MUCH THEY
[ct=4223.737] CARE, HOW MUCH THEY
[ct=4224.443] COMMUNICATE.
[ct=4224.867] THAT’S WHO THEY ARE
[ct=4225.438] RIGHT THERE, THE FOCUS
[ct=4226.748] ON THE SIDELINES, THE
[ct=4227.636] COMMUNICATION.
[ct=4229.094] TALK ABOUT A BIG
[ct=4229.510] SERIES FOR THE
[ct=4231.059] RAIDERS, THEY’RE JUST
[ct=4232.441] NOT EQUIPPED TO GET
[ct=4234.087] DOWN 17-3 TO MAHOMES
[ct=4238.849] AND HAVE A CHANCE TO
[ct=4240.232] COME BACK AND WIN THIS
[ct=4242.573] >> Al: MAHOMES, THAT’S
[ct=4243.154] FIRED, CAUGHT AND
[ct=4245.229] THAT’S GRAY.
[ct=4246.499] AND NOAH GRAY.
[ct=4247.804] SO GRAY’S NOW CAUGHT
[ct=4247.964] THREE.
[ct=4249.459] KELCE’S CAUGHT SIX.
[ct=4250.676] THE TWO TIGHT ENDS
[ct=4252.311] HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR
[ct=4252.761] OVER 120 YARDS.
[ct=4255.341] >> Kirk: SO IF WHEN
[ct=4255.761] YOU HAVE SAFETIES,
[ct=4256.442] AGAIN, GOING TO SIT
[ct=4257.353] BACK, THERE’S GOING TO
[ct=4261.236] BE A LOT OF SPACE.
[ct=4262.369] AND THESE TIGHT ENDS
[ct=4263.098] GOOD AS MANY OF
[ct=4266.138] FEELING THE SPACE.
[ct=4267.712] NOAH GRAY LEARNED FROM
[ct=4269.025] THE BEST IN KELCE.
[ct=4273.252] FIND YOU WHEN YOU SIT
[ct=4275.235] IN THAT SOFT SPOT.
[ct=4278.808] ISAIAH, THERE HE GOES,
[ct=4282.202] INSIDE THE 30, PUSHED
[ct=4282.856] OUT OF BOUNDS INSIDE
[ct=4284.397] THE 20 YARD LINE.
[ct=4285.473] HE’S BACK INDEED.
[ct=4287.124] AND THAT’S THE
[ct=4287.992] DIFFERENCE WITH THIS
[ct=4289.029] OFFENSE.
[ct=4290.663] WHAT BLOCKING IN
[ct=4295.623] INTERIOR WITH TOONEY
[ct=4299.930] AND HUMPHREY AND TREY
[ct=4300.641] SMITH CLIMBING UP TO
[ct=4302.013] THE NEXT LEVEL.
[ct=4302.432] WHEN YOU CAN GET THE
[ct=4303.951] HAT ON A HAT AND YOU
[ct=4304.951] HAVE TEN BACK THERE.
[ct=4307.217] NOTHING AGAINST KAREEM
[ct=4310.057] HUNT BUT HE IS MORE OF
[ct=4311.372] A THUMPER.
[ct=4313.837] THIS GUY BRINGS
[ct=4315.324] EXPLOSIVE NATURE OUT
[ct=4316.220] OF THIS OFFENSE AND
[ct=4317.111] COMPLEMENTS EVERYTHING
[ct=4319.269] MAHOMES CAN DO.
[ct=4321.154] >> Al: 34 YARDS.
[ct=4322.039] 34 TOTAL IN THE GAME
[ct=4323.161] TO THIS POINT.
[ct=4325.201] AGAIN, MUCHECKO,
[ct=4326.774] BROKEN FIBULA WEEK 2,
[ct=4328.638] BEEN ON THE MEND,
[ct=4329.497] COULDN’T WAIT TO GET
[ct=4333.659] BACK AND HERE HE IS.
[ct=4335.035] >> Kirk: YOI DON’T KNOW
[ct=4335.695] IF HE’S ON A PITCH
[ct=4337.548] COUNT OR WHAT IT IS.
[ct=4339.192] HE HAS SUCH AN
[ct=4340.463] IMPORTANT PART IN THE
[ct=4342.071] STRETCH RUN THE REST
[ct=4342.071] OF DECEMBER INTO
[ct=4343.021] JANUARY.
[ct=4343.228] IF THEY’RE GOING TO
[ct=4345.018] MAKE A RUN, THEY NEED
[ct=4347.694] HIM HEALTHY.
[ct=4348.905] >> Al: ANOTHER LATE
[ct=4354.211] ROUND FIND.
[ct=4354.676] PUCHECKY SECOND-ROUND
[ct=4356.903] PICK OUT OF RUTGERS.
[ct=4359.562] 2nd AND 9.
[ct=4359.562] MAHOMES, FLAG.
[ct=4360.120] DROPS THE BALL, AND
[ct=4361.727] SECURES IT BACK AT THE
[ct=4362.330] 35 YARD LINE.
[ct=4363.813] CHASED BY CROSBY.
[ct=4366.927] SEE ABOUT THE CALL
[ct=4368.774] GOING TO GO AGAINST
[ct=4373.022] >> Referee: ILLEGAL
[ct=4374.167] FORMATION, OFFENSE
[ct=4374.631] NUMBER 74 WAS IN THE
[ct=4379.455] PENALTY’S DECLINED.
[ct=4380.719] >> Al: DECLINED OF
[ct=4382.041] COURSE BECAUSE IT’S A
[ct=4383.562] 20 YARD LOSS.
[ct=4384.247] >> Kirk: THIS GETS
[ct=4385.665] CALLED ON TAYLOR AS
[ct=4387.763] MUCH AS ANYBODY IN THE
[ct=4389.102] YOU CAN CALL THE
[ct=4389.281] TAYLOR RULE.
[ct=4390.145] THE RIGHT TACKLE
[ct=4393.054] SETTING UP TOO BIG
[ct=4393.923] BECAUSE OF CROSBY.
[ct=4394.638] THE RESPECT HE HAS FOR
[ct=4396.161] CROSBY AS A PASS
[ct=4396.536] RUSHER.
[ct=4397.537] THIS IS THE LOOK.
[ct=4398.736] YOU’VE SEEN IT CALLED
[ct=4400.443] OVER THE NFL.
[ct=4400.608] YOU WONDER WHY IT’S AN
[ct=4401.918] ILLEGAL FORMATION IS
[ct=4402.871] BECAUSE THAT TACKLE IS
[ct=4403.741] OFF THE LINE OF
[ct=4404.915] SCRIMMAGE THAT FAR,
[ct=4406.144] AND THAT’S WHERE YOU
[ct=4411.261] GOT TO BE FOR IT TO BE
[ct=4413.054] ILLEGAL FORPATION.
[ct=4413.476] >> Al: YOU MENTION
[ct=4415.533] TAYLOR HERE AND --
[ct=4415.973] WELL, NEVER MIND.
[ct=4417.204] 3rd AND 30, PASS
[ct=4417.893] CAUGHT INSIDE THE
[ct=4420.356] SIDELINE AND ALONG
[ct=4424.953] GOES DEANDRE HOPKINS.
[ct=4426.265] SO IN COMES THE FIELD
[ct=4427.271] UNIT.
[ct=4427.723] >> Kirk: HOW WE’RE
[ct=4430.526] DIGGING OURSELVES
[ct=4430.526] HOLES WHETHER IT’S
[ct=4432.838] SACKS OR PENALTIES,
[ct=4433.303] THAT’S BEEN THE ONE
[ct=4434.397] AREA ABLE TO SLOW THIS
[ct=4435.453] CHIEFS OFFENSE DOWN IS
[ct=4437.630] GETTING THEMSELVES WAY
[ct=4442.949] >> Al: SO TO THE 42
[ct=4444.641] YARD LINE -- TO THE 32
[ct=4447.133] YARD LINE, A 42-YARD
[ct=4449.975] ATTEMPT HERE FOR THE
[ct=4452.414] CHAISSON, MATTHEW
[ct=4452.940] WRIGHT.
[ct=4456.711] BUTKER OUT, SHRADER
[ct=4457.369] KICKED LAST WEEK, HE’S
[ct=4458.871] HE’S HURT.
[ct=4459.829] WRIGHT COMES OFF THE
[ct=4462.244] STREET, AND WRIGHT
[ct=4465.150] PUTS IT THROUGH.
[ct=4465.562] 42-YARD FIELD GOAL
[ct=4467.658] KANSAS CITY ON THIS
[ct=4468.886] LAST FRIDAY OF
[ct=4470.424] NOVEMBER.
[ct=4473.231] >> Kirk: HAVE YOU EVER
[ct=4474.586] PLAYED?
[ct=4474.730] >> Al: I HAVE.
[ct=4477.230] I WAS PART OF THAT
[ct=4479.843] >> Kirk: I KNOW YOU
[ct=4481.350] WERE PART OF IT.
[ct=4482.063] >> Al: I WAS VERY BAD,
[ct=4483.829] TOO, AS YOU CAN
[ct=4485.194] IMAGINE.
[ct=4486.519] UP TO THE 30 ON THE
[ct=4488.237] RUN BACK.
[ct=4489.248] D.J. TURNER RIGHT IN
[ct=4491.986] FRONT OF THAT RAIDER
[ct=4493.519] BENCH.
[ct=4493.519] >> Kirk: I WONDER IF
[ct=4494.875] JOHN WAS A GOOD PLAYER
[ct=4497.672] IN HIS OWN BACK IN
[ct=4499.035] DAY.
[ct=4500.234] WANT TO KNOW IF EVER
[ct=4502.151] GOT A CHANCE TO PLAY.
[ct=4503.744] WE’VE GOT A MAN DOWN
[ct=4507.503] >> Al: TURNER.
[ct=4511.255] D.J. TURNER IS DOWN.
[ct=4511.255] YEP.
[ct=4522.644] TRYING TO GET UP.
[ct=4523.904] THAT ONE TOUCHDOWN
[ct=4524.393] PASS GAME AGAINST THE
[ct=4525.632] CHIEFS, SO THEY WORK
[ct=4529.599] ON HIM.
[ct=4530.888] WITH 8:30 TO GO IN THE
[ct=4531.875] THIRD.
[ct=4532.293] >> Kirk: YEAH, HE’S
[ct=4533.210] GOING TO GET UP.
[ct=4534.466] HE’S RIGHT THERE ON
[ct=4541.540] HIS OWN SIDELINE.
[ct=4546.421] YEAH, THAT BALL --
[ct=4550.433] THAT BALL CAME OUT.
[ct=4551.091] RIGHT THERE, JUST
[ct=4553.093] BEFORE HE EVEN GOT
[ct=4553.902] CONTACT, YOU CAN SEE
[ct=4557.090] IT WAS A LITTLE BIT --
[ct=4558.362] THAT LEFT LEG LOOKED
[ct=4561.218] LIKE IT HAD AN ISSUE.
[ct=4562.769] HOPEFULLY HE’S GOING
[ct=4565.203] TO BE ALL RIGHT THERE,
[ct=4565.829] BUT ONE THING ABOUT
[ct=4566.432] THE FOOTBALL COMING
[ct=4569.546] OUT, YOU KNOW, THIS
[ct=4570.878] TEAM IS MINUS 17 IN
[ct=4574.032] TURNOVER MARGIN, DEAD
[ct=4574.509] LAST IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=4575.448] I DON’T MEAN TO JINX
[ct=4576.707] THEY’VE DONE A BETTER
[ct=4577.647] JOB TODAY.
[ct=4578.131] THEY’RE TAKING CARE OF
[ct=4580.918] THE BALL.
[ct=4581.354] >> Al: SO HE’S
[ct=4584.911] REPLACED BY TERRACE
[ct=4586.293] MARSHALL.
[ct=4586.939] JUST GOT ACTIVATED AND
[ct=4587.830] THAT PASS IS CAUGHT
[ct=4589.249] AND TAKEN TO THE 40
[ct=4591.735] YARD LINE THERE BY
[ct=4594.570] BROCK BOWERS.
[ct=4596.262] >> Kirk: THE GUY WE’VE
[ct=4598.516] BEEN WATCHING IS CHRIS
[ct=4602.754] WHEN IT COMES TO I
[ct=4602.965] WHEN IT COMES TO THE
[ct=4606.529] INTERIOR, HE’S BEEN
[ct=4609.155] ABLE TO COME AWAY WITH
[ct=4610.470] TWO BIG SACKS FOR THIS
[ct=4611.820] CHIEFS DEFENSE.
[ct=4612.235] LOOKING LIKE CHRIS
[ct=4613.544] JONES AS A GAME
[ct=4615.835] WRECKER.
[ct=4615.996] >> Al: LAST PLAY
[ct=4617.320] GAINING 11.
[ct=4625.341] TO THE 41.
[ct=4628.427] TOSS BACK HERE.
[ct=4630.828] NICK BOLTON MAKING THE
[ct=4634.815] >> Kirk: YOU’RE GOING
[ct=4636.331] TO LOVE THIS, AL.
[ct=4637.611] FIRST, HE’S GOT TO BE
[ct=4638.453] ABLE TO OUTRUN THE
[ct=4639.913] CENTER, THE ROOKIE
[ct=4641.155] TRYING TO CLIMB UP TO
[ct=4642.547] WATCH HOW HE GETS AWAY
[ct=4643.715] FROM THE CENTER, DOES
[ct=4645.114] NOW HE’S GOT TO TAKE
[ct=4646.745] ON THE POLAR, PUSHES
[ct=4647.399] HIM BACK AND THEN
[ct=4649.029] MAKES THE TACKLE RIGHT
[ct=4650.961] SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=4651.937] SO BOTH ROOKIES
[ct=4653.250] LEARNED A LESSON THERE
[ct=4654.100] AGAINST ONE OF THE
[ct=4655.829] SEASONED MIDDLE LINE
[ct=4657.054] BACKERS.
[ct=4657.587] THE CENTER TRYING TO
[ct=4658.849] CLIMB TO HIM, AND THAT
[ct=4659.875] RIGHT TACKLE JUST
[ct=4661.235] COULD NOT HANDLE HIS
[ct=4663.063] POWER WHEN HE CAME
[ct=4664.419] THROUGH THERE ON THAT
[ct=4668.272] PULL.
[ct=4669.240] >> Al: 2nd AND 9.
[ct=4671.589] FLIP IT BACK HERE.
[ct=4673.297] AND BURIED.
[ct=4677.544] McCORMICK TAKEN DOWN
[ct=4677.777] THEN JOINED ALONG THE
[ct=4679.599] WAY.
[ct=4679.808] >> Kirk: AT LEAST THE
[ct=4681.234] LAST PLAY THEY TRIED
[ct=4682.160] TO BLOCK HIM.
[ct=4684.438] THIS TIME THEY DIDN’T
[ct=4684.626] BLOCK IT.
[ct=4686.040] LAST TIME THEY HAD TWO
[ct=4687.426] GUYS ON HIM.
[ct=4689.911] THIS TIME NOBODY, SO
[ct=4690.300] YOU SET THE EDGE WITH
[ct=4690.766] WILLIAMS AND THEN YOU
[ct=4694.063] LET THE BIG FELLA 32
[ct=4695.297] BOLTON CLEAN IT UP.
[ct=4696.600] BACK-TO-BACK PLAYS BY
[ct=4697.747] THE MIDDLE LINEBACKER,
[ct=4699.703] THE LEANER OF THIS
[ct=4703.524] >> Al: 3rd AND 10.
[ct=4704.697] >> Kirk: JONES UP HERE
[ct=4709.229] ON THAT EDGE AGAIN.
[ct=4710.460] >> Al: THREE
[ct=4712.494] SET TO THE RIGHT AND
[ct=4717.208] BUT THERE’S A FLAG.
[ct=4717.208] LOOKED LIKE -- IT
[ct=4718.542] LOOKED LIKE KANSAS
[ct=4723.000] CITY WAS OFF SIDE.
[ct=4723.890] INDEED.
[ct=4725.025] ALL RIGHT, SO 3rd DOWN
[ct=4726.685] AND 5 NOW.
[ct=4728.201] TRYING TO USE THAT
[ct=4729.384] WISDOM OF A VETERAN
[ct=4730.420] JUST TRYING TO GUESS
[ct=4731.239] THAT SNAP COUNT AND
[ct=4732.903] MISSES IT BY JUST
[ct=4735.578] ABOUT HALF A BEAT.
[ct=4738.237] SO 3rd AND 10 TO NOW
[ct=4742.160] 3rd AND 5 FOR
[ct=4743.005] O’DONNELL -- OR
[ct=4745.254] O’CONNELL, RATHER.
[ct=4746.806] >> Al: 6:30 TO GO IN
[ct=4756.989] THE THIRD.
[ct=4759.807] 10-POINT GAME.
[ct=4760.482] GOING DEEP.
[ct=4763.940] AND CAN HE ONE-HAND
[ct=4764.583] IT?
[ct=4765.259] WITH A FLAG THROWN AT
[ct=4767.025] THE END OF THE PLAY.
[ct=4768.389] BROCK BOWERS PULLING
[ct=4768.389] IT IN.
[ct=4769.984] I MEAN THE ONE-HANDED
[ct=4771.210] CATCH HAS BECOME LIKE
[ct=4774.010] EVERY WEEK, EVERY
[ct=4774.638] >> Kirk: WATCH AT THE
[ct=4776.524] END OF THIS OUT, IT
[ct=4777.425] ALMOST LOOKS LIKE HOW
[ct=4778.758] YOU TRY TO CATCH AN
[ct=4779.790] EGG.
[ct=4779.974] LIKE EVERYONE’S
[ct=4781.091] THROWING EGGS BACK AND
[ct=4782.020] FORTH TO EACH OTHER,
[ct=4782.857] JUST KIND OF SOFT,
[ct=4784.082] JUST KIND OF TAKES THE
[ct=4784.778] AIR OFF OF THE BALL
[ct=4785.740] AND BRINGS IT IN.
[ct=4786.986] AND IT DOES GET THE
[ct=4788.197] LEFT HAND IN THERE TO
[ct=4788.861] BE ABLE TO HELP HIM
[ct=4792.556] REMEMBER THIS GUY IS
[ct=4793.240] TIGHT END, A TIGHT END
[ct=4793.497] WITH THE SKILL SET OF
[ct=4794.773] A WIDE RECEIVER TO
[ct=4795.504] FLEX HIM OUT.
[ct=4797.295] THAT’S 3rd DOWN AND 5.
[ct=4798.784] YOU GET HIM MATCHED UP
[ct=4799.354] OUT THERE AGAINST A
[ct=4800.415] CORNER AND YOU TAKE
[ct=4801.102] THAT SHOT.
[ct=4802.113] RECOGNIZING THE
[ct=4803.660] MATCHUP, AND HE HITS
[ct=4807.379] >> Al: 29 YARDS.
[ct=4808.867] IN BUSINESS AT THE 25
[ct=4815.298] OVER THE RIGHT SIDE,
[ct=4817.441] GAIN OF A COUPLE.
[ct=4818.593] CHRIS JONES STOPPING
[ct=4822.187] ABDULLAH ON THAT PLAY.
[ct=4822.350] >> Kirk: REMEMBER THEY
[ct=4823.035] MISSED A FIELD GOAL IN
[ct=4824.376] PLUS TERRITORY, HAD A
[ct=4826.337] TURNOVER ON DOWNS.
[ct=4826.973] THEY COULD BE MUCH
[ct=4827.710] CLOSER IN THIS
[ct=4830.237] FOOTBALL GAME DOWN 10,
[ct=4832.100] 6 MINUTES TO GO NOW IN
[ct=4832.308] THIS GAME.
[ct=4834.821] THIS IS A DRIVE
[ct=4835.509] THEY’VE GOT TO FIND A
[ct=4836.065] WAY TO FINISH.
[ct=4838.226] >> Al: BIG, BIG DRIVE.
[ct=4840.497] 79 RECEPTIONS.
[ct=4841.986] ODEL BECKHAM HAD MORE
[ct=4847.519] RESES,
[ct=4849.693] RECEPTIONS, 92 THROUGH
[ct=4851.990] HIS FIRST 12 GAMES.
[ct=4853.780] THIS GUY IS LIKE KELCE
[ct=4855.495] 2.0.
[ct=4856.773] HE’S THE NEXT KELCE.
[ct=4859.519] 2nd AND 7.
[ct=4860.194] O’CONNELL FIRES, INTO
[ct=4860.750] TRAFFIC, DROPPED.
[ct=4862.201] TRY TO GET THAT ONE TO
[ct=4865.198] YOU’VE GOT TRANQUILL
[ct=4866.260] COVERING ON A PLAY.
[ct=4869.395] 3rd AND 7 UPCOMING.
[ct=4873.506] MATCHUP THAT IS
[ct=4875.976] BETWEEN TRANQUILL AND
[ct=4879.039] THAT BALL GOT OUT SO
[ct=4881.393] EARLY I THINK IT
[ct=4881.810] SURPRISED BOWERS.
[ct=4883.068] IT SNUCK UP ON HIM.
[ct=4883.460] THAT WAS TIGHT
[ct=4893.566] COVERAGE BY TRANQQUAL
[ct=4893.790] COVERAGE BY TRANQQUILL
[ct=4894.892] THE LINEBACKER.
[ct=4895.790] SEE IF HIS SAFETY
[ct=4897.446] HELPS OUT.
[ct=4898.929] >> Al: RUSHED FOR IT,
[ct=4901.430] LOOKS OUT FROM BEHIND,
[ct=4902.498] DOWN HE GUYS.
[ct=4903.604] LAST THING THEY NEEDED
[ct=4906.230] A BIG SACK.
[ct=4906.720] KARLAFTIS.
[ct=4908.250] SO YOU’RE IN VERY
[ct=4909.334] MAKEABLE FIELD GOAL
[ct=4911.554] RANGE, AND NOW AFTER A
[ct=4914.471] 15-YARD SACK, 4th AND
[ct=4915.830] 22.
[ct=4918.725] GREAT POINT, AL.
[ct=4919.255] KARLAFTIS GETS THE
[ct=4920.312] SACK, BUT IT’S REALLY
[ct=4921.508] THE COVERAGE.
[ct=4922.223] HE EVENTUALLY DOES A
[ct=4924.492] GOOD JOB WITH THAT
[ct=4924.947] RELENTLESS ATTITUDE.
[ct=4926.595] WE WANTED TO SEE HOW
[ct=4927.519] IS HE GOING TO FIND A
[ct=4931.179] WAY TO GET TO BOWERS.
[ct=4931.573] 22, REID JAMS HIM.
[ct=4933.091] HE’S TRYING TO DISRUPT
[ct=4933.801] THAT TIMING AND WAS
[ct=4934.669] LOOKING AT HIM TO
[ct=4937.949] THROW THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=4937.949] BUT BECAUSE HE JAMMED
[ct=4940.278] HIM, HE DISRUPTED THE
[ct=4940.655] TIMING.
[ct=4942.349] >> Al: 53 YARD FOR
[ct=4948.845] THIS ONE EARLIER, THIS
[ct=4950.164] ONE IS NO GOOD.
[ct=4951.713] MISSED TWO, STILL DOWN
[ct=4952.076] BY 10
[ct=4952.677] ULTIMATE GAME.
[ct=4952.987] GUYS, IF THE CHIEFS
[ct=4953.537] SECURE HOMEFIELD
[ct=4955.420] ADVANTAGE, ARROWHEAD
[ct=4956.589] COULD BE FRIGID FOR
[ct=4957.749] ANYONE WHO ENTERS.
[ct=4959.954] >> Al: YOU’D KNOW
[ct=4960.547] BETTER THAN ANYBODY,
[ct=4963.020] THAT CRAZY WILD CARD
[ct=4963.611] GAME AGAINST MIAMI
[ct=4964.414] LAST YEAR, KAYLEE
[ct=4966.094] WORKING THE SIDELINES.
[ct=4966.622] MEANWHILE THE PASS IS
[ct=4969.690] DROPPED BY NOAH GRAY.
[ct=4971.359] PEOPLE FORGET WITH THE
[ct=4972.371] RULE PUT IN A COUPLE
[ct=4973.462] OF YEARS AGO ONLY ONE
[ct=4974.756] TEAM WHEN THEY WENT TO
[ct=4976.659] SEVEN TEAMS THEN
[ct=4977.256] PLAYOFFS FROM EACH
[ct=4978.296] CONFERENCE, ONLY ONE
[ct=4980.373] TEAM GETS A BYE.
[ct=4981.320] EVERYONE WOULD HAVE TO
[ct=4982.267] WIN FOUR INCLUDING THE
[ct=4983.525] SUPER BOWL TO LIFT A
[ct=4985.994] LOMBARDY.
[ct=4987.416] >> Kirk: YEAH IN THIS
[ct=4988.325] AFC YOU FEEL LIKE IT’S
[ct=4989.432] GOING TO GO DOWN TO
[ct=4992.082] THE LAST WEEK OR TWO.
[ct=4992.746] PITTSBURGH, BUFFALO,
[ct=4994.264] BALTIMORE.
[ct=4994.641] IT’S GOING TO BE A
[ct=4995.973] GREAT RACE TO THE END.
[ct=4997.627] >> Al: 2nd AND 10,
[ct=4998.346] QUICK PASS.
[ct=4999.697] AND THAT’S NOT HAULED
[ct=5001.462] IN, SO STRANGELY
[ct=5003.128] ENOUGH YOU’VE GOT GRAY
[ct=5005.407] AND KELCE, AND NEITHER
[ct=5008.053] COULD HOLD ON.
[ct=5008.053] >> Kirk: THAT TIME
[ct=5009.400] THEY BROUGHT A BLITZ
[ct=5010.353] OFF KELCE AND QUICK
[ct=5012.442] THROW, EASY THROW ONCE
[ct=5013.550] HE’S ABLE TO RECOGNIZE
[ct=5014.888] THAT BY PATRICK
[ct=5016.163] MUHOELS, BUT YOU’RE
[ct=5017.039] RIGHT, NOT USED TO
[ct=5017.981] SEEING THIS.
[ct=5019.304] NOAH GRAY ON 1st AND
[ct=5022.126] THIS TIME KELCE
[ct=5022.512] STARTING IT.
[ct=5023.587] GOES TO SHOW AS GOOD
[ct=5024.644] AS HE IS, BEST IN THE
[ct=5025.689] BUSINESS, JUST STARTS
[ct=5026.344] TO LOOK A LITTLE BIT
[ct=5028.521] EARLY THERE ON THAT
[ct=5033.494] >> Al: THEY’RE LOSING
[ct=5034.761] IT, LET’S FACE IT.
[ct=5038.532] 3rd AND 10.
[ct=5038.748] MAHOMES DEEP DOWN THE
[ct=5041.327] LEFT SIDELINE, AND IS
[ct=5044.185] IT HAULED IN?
[ct=5050.796] YES, IT IS.
[ct=5058.029] DEANDRE HOPKINS.
[ct=5058.819] >> Kirk: AND WATCH THE
[ct=5061.837] OUT AND IN.
[ct=5061.837] RICHARDSON DIDN’T
[ct=5064.067] REALIZE THE BALL WAS
[ct=5065.929] CLOSE TO HIP BECAUSE
[ct=5068.571] D. HOP DIDN’T LET HIM.
[ct=5068.924] WHAT A GREAT JOB ON
[ct=5070.065] THE ROUTE AND THE
[ct=5070.889] CATCH THERE ON THAT
[ct=5073.120] BIG 3rd AND 10.
[ct=5076.863] >> Al: 3rd AND 10 FOR
[ct=5078.243] 31 YARDS.
[ct=5085.210] THAT’S INCOMPLETE.
[ct=5087.822] >> Kirk: PATRICK
[ct=5088.230] MAHOMES HAS HAD SOME
[ct=5088.597] TYPICAL PATRICK
[ct=5088.977] MAHOMES MOMENTS
[ct=5089.828] TONIGHT IN THIS
[ct=5091.169] AVOIDING THE PRESSURE,
[ct=5092.154] CROSBY THERE AT THE
[ct=5093.194] END, STILL ABLE TO
[ct=5094.129] THROW ACCURATELY AND
[ct=5095.149] FINDING KELCE.
[ct=5097.268] HERE A LITTLE PUMP AND
[ct=5099.330] GO, ABOUT 14, 15
[ct=5100.394] SECONDS IN THE FIRST
[ct=5102.930] JONES WITH HIS EYES IN
[ct=5103.272] THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=5103.928] HERE’S THE NO LOOK,
[ct=5104.980] TONGUE OUT, TOUCHDOWN
[ct=5105.463] PASS HERE.
[ct=5106.457] LOOK AT THE LOCATION
[ct=5108.268] OF THAT FOOTBALL.
[ct=5109.024] SOMEHOW HAS ENOUGH ON
[ct=5110.532] IT AS HE’S BEING HIT
[ct=5111.286] TO DELIVER THAT
[ct=5113.961] TOUCHDOWN TO WATSON.
[ct=5114.774] >> Al: WHO DO YOU
[ct=5115.280] THINK OF WHEN YOU
[ct=5117.101] THINK OF THE TONGUE
[ct=5117.895] OUT?
[ct=5118.988] >> Kirk: ONE GUY.
[ct=5119.600] >> Al: 23 FOR THE
[ct=5121.248] CHICAGO BULLS.
[ct=5121.682] CHAT PASS IS GOING
[ct=5123.932] DOWN -- NO, IT’S NO
[ct=5125.250] GOOD.
[ct=5126.597] XAVIER WORTHY SHORT
[ct=5127.893] HOPS.
[ct=5131.886] >> Kirk: HE PLAYS HIS
[ct=5133.255] BEST IN THE CRITICAL
[ct=5134.540] MOMENTS.
[ct=5135.605] MEANING 3rd DOWN,
[ct=5137.205] COMPLETING 70 ERS OF
[ct=5140.017] HIS PASSES THIS YEAR.
[ct=5140.613] FOURTH QUARTER SAME
[ct=5142.972] THING, 70%.
[ct=5144.301] HERE WE ARE CLOSE TO
[ct=5145.639] THE RED ZONE.
[ct=5146.488] LOOKS LIKE THEY’RE
[ct=5147.593] GOING TO TAKE A PEEK.
[ct=5148.754] THE CROWD IS SAYING
[ct=5149.143] IT’S DEFINITELY A
[ct=5151.460] DOES WORTHY GET HIS
[ct=5153.155] HANDS UNDERNEATH?
[ct=5154.240] YEAH, THAT BALL NEVER
[ct=5155.781] HIT THE GROUND.
[ct=5159.531] THAT’S DEFINITELY A
[ct=5161.596] THE GREATEST REPLAY
[ct=5163.709] ASSIST.
[ct=5163.709] >> Al: IT’S GOOD WHEN
[ct=5165.295] IT WORKS, AND IT DOES
[ct=5166.055] RIGHT HERE.
[ct=5166.998] YOU HAVE TO LIKE WHEN
[ct=5169.057] IT’S EXPEDITED FOR
[ct=5169.430] SURE INSTEAD OF
[ct=5170.776] SCOOTING AROUND FOR 2
[ct=5172.408] MINUTES.
[ct=5174.553] WAS A QUICK ONE AND A
[ct=5175.881] BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
[ct=5181.245] 3rd AND 10 AND NOW 3rd
[ct=5182.920] AND 3.
[ct=5183.961] >> Al: SO 3rd AND 3
[ct=5189.544] NOW AT THE 17.
[ct=5195.071] STAYS IN THE BLOCK,
[ct=5195.791] MAHOMES UNDER
[ct=5197.527] PRESSURE, OVERSHOOTS
[ct=5197.984] HIS MAN.
[ct=5201.896] HE HAD KELCE.
[ct=5203.505] >> Kirk: AGAIN, THEY
[ct=5204.613] BROUGHT THE HOUSE.
[ct=5205.375] THEY KEEP MIXING THESE
[ct=5206.947] LOOKS IN, GOING COVER
[ct=5208.426] ZERO, MEANING
[ct=5209.232] EVERYBODY’S ON AN
[ct=5210.145] ISLAND.
[ct=5210.810] YOU DON’T HAVE ANY
[ct=5212.388] SAFETY SUPPORT.
[ct=5213.319] ONE, TWO, THREE, IF
[ct=5215.774] YOU, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN.
[ct=5217.864] EVERYBODY’S PICKED UP.
[ct=5218.240] MAHOMES HAS WHAT HE
[ct=5219.155] WANTS WITH KELCE
[ct=5220.013] ISOLATED IN A
[ct=5222.649] ONE-ON-ONE MATCHUP.
[ct=5223.209] JUST NOT ABLE TO HIT
[ct=5224.035] HIM HERE IN THIS
[ct=5231.386] THAT IS MISMATCH, BUT
[ct=5232.398] HE DIDN’T QUITE HAVE
[ct=5233.211] ENOUGH TIME TO
[ct=5233.885] DELIVER.
[ct=5234.771] >> Al: THAT’S A STUFF
[ct=5235.896] THE PRESSES STUFF FOR
[ct=5237.563] THOSE TWO GUYS.
[ct=5238.761] RIGHT NOW FOR THE
[ct=5240.195] 35-YARD ATTEMPT.
[ct=5243.859] AND DOWN THE MIDDLE
[ct=5244.726] FOR HIM.
[ct=5247.848] SO WITH 3:11 TO PLAY
[ct=5248.483] NOW IN THE THIRD,
[ct=5250.586] KANSAS CITY UP 16-3.
[ct=5253.170] >> Al: WHEN THE
[ct=5253.541] SCHEDULE CAME OUT AND
[ct=5255.578] LOOKED AT WEEK 14 WE
[ct=5256.324] SAID THAT SHOULD BE A
[ct=5257.086] GOOD ONE,
[ct=5258.792] PACKERS-LIONS.
[ct=5260.181] TURNS OUT IT’S A GREAT
[ct=5261.628] ONE, GREEN BAY AT
[ct=5263.430] DETROIT NEXT THURSDAY
[ct=5264.707] NIGHT ON PRIME.
[ct=5268.358] HANG WITH US.
[ct=5269.890] TAKE A LOOK AT TIS, A
[ct=5272.686] LITTLE FRIENDLY FIRE
[ct=5273.107] THE LAST PLAY.
[ct=5274.892] SLOW TO GET UP.
[ct=5275.920] TOOK A LOOK DURING THE
[ct=5277.093] BREAK.
[ct=5277.874] SEE ONE OF HIS
[ct=5283.860] LINEMEN, ONE OF THE
[ct=5284.439] BIG FELLAS THERE.
[ct=5286.348] >> Al: SO FLEXING THAT
[ct=5287.691] NON-THROWING HAND AS
[ct=5288.296] HE GOES TO THE
[ct=5290.348] SIDELINE HERE.
[ct=5290.822] KICK OFF IS A BOUNCING
[ct=5293.351] IT’S FIELDED AT THE 6
[ct=5297.322] YARD LINE BY ABDULLAH.
[ct=5299.927] THREADING HIS WAY, AND
[ct=5300.927] ABDULLAH WILL TAKE THE
[ct=5304.426] BALL INSIDE THE 30 TO
[ct=5309.248] THE 25 YARD LINE.
[ct=5310.167] AMEER ABDULLAH FINALLY
[ct=5315.895] CHAMARRI CONNER.
[ct=5317.917] SO IF EVER A GOOD RUN
[ct=5318.908] BACK WAS NEEDED, THIS
[ct=5321.262] WAS THE POINT.
[ct=5323.856] >> Kirk: REALLY AMEER
[ct=5325.386] ABDULLAH, THAT’S WHAT
[ct=5326.524] HIS CALLING CARD HAS
[ct=5327.111] BEEN WITH THE TWO
[ct=5328.226] STARTING BACKS OUT,
[ct=5329.050] HE’S HAD TO BE THE
[ct=5330.863] GUY.
[ct=5331.255] LOOK AT THAT MOVE,
[ct=5333.468] THAT INITIAL MOVE TO
[ct=5333.975] GET HIM STARTED.
[ct=5335.068] THEN HE HITS THAT
[ct=5336.114] CREASE.
[ct=5336.558] GREAT BLOCKING AND
[ct=5338.250] THEN IT’S A FOOTRACE.
[ct=5339.788] EVENTUALLY CONNERS
[ct=5340.179] ABLE TO CHASE HIM
[ct=5341.555] WHAT A BIG RETURN HERE
[ct=5342.661] FOR THE RAIDERS.
[ct=5343.641] LIKE YOU SAID, AL, IN
[ct=5344.700] A CRITICAL TIME HERE
[ct=5345.535] TO GET THEM BACK INTO
[ct=5347.125] THIS GAME, SEE IF THEY
[ct=5347.740] CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
[ct=5351.524] THE OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=5351.930] >> Al: 69 YEARS.
[ct=5352.333] McCORMICK IS THE
[ct=5354.338] RUNNING BACK.
[ct=5354.338] FROM THE 26.
[ct=5355.662] THE RAIDERS HAVE HAD A
[ct=5357.906] COUPLE OF GOOD DRIVES
[ct=5358.271] THAT HAVE COME UP
[ct=5360.078] EMPTY BACK-TO-BACK.
[ct=5361.189] McCORMICK PICKS UP 2.
[ct=5362.942] HAD A MISSED FIELD
[ct=5364.232] GOAL, TURNOVER ON
[ct=5365.431] DOWNS AND ANOTHER
[ct=5366.323] MISSED FIELD GOAL, SO
[ct=5368.403] OPPORTUNITIES.
[ct=5368.957] THEY JUST CAN’T CASH
[ct=5369.609] IN.
[ct=5369.998] LET’S SEE WHAT THE
[ct=5371.328] APPROACH IS HERE WITH
[ct=5373.950] SCOTT TURNER AND HOW
[ct=5375.451] THEY’RE GOING TO TRY
[ct=5375.839] TO COME WINDUP A WAY,
[ct=5376.594] THEY’RE GOING TO HAVE
[ct=5377.146] TO MAKE A PLAY THROUGH
[ct=5378.241] THE AIR.
[ct=5378.645] THEY’VE GOT TO PROTECT
[ct=5379.522] THE QUARTERBACK, AND
[ct=5380.373] IT’S EITHER GOING TO
[ct=5381.678] BE BOWERS AND MEYERS
[ct=5382.891] GOING TO HAVE TO WIN.
[ct=5385.193] WHETHER IT’S ZONE
[ct=5386.745] SETTLING IN THAT SOFT
[ct=5387.092] SPOT OR BEING ABLE TO
[ct=5388.314] WIN IN MANNED
[ct=5390.541] >> Al: O’CONNELL HAS
[ct=5393.171] COMPLETED 11 PASSES.
[ct=5394.476] 5 TO MEYERS, 5 TO
[ct=5398.675] BOWERS, 1 TO TURNER.
[ct=5399.934] EMPTIES THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=5401.440] GOING FIVE WIDE.
[ct=5403.012] 2nd AND 7, UNDER
[ct=5405.411] PRESSURE.
[ct=5405.594] FLAG.
[ct=5408.033] LOOKING TO GET OUT OF
[ct=5409.057] BOUNDS AND HE DOES
[ct=5409.961] JUST OVER THE FIRST
[ct=5411.315] DOWN MARK WITH A FLAG.
[ct=5411.734] >> Kirk: IT’S GOING TO
[ct=5413.816] BE A HOLDING.
[ct=5414.765] >> Al: AS IT NORMALLY
[ct=5418.475] IS IN THAT SITUATION.
[ct=5419.783] FLAG COMES IN.
[ct=5422.357] OFFENSE NUMBER 74,
[ct=5431.694] >> Al: KOLTON MILLER
[ct=5433.233] THE LEFT TACKLE.
[ct=5435.854] >> Kirk: OMENIHU HAS
[ct=5437.613] WORKED SO HARD TO COME
[ct=5438.934] BACK, APPLYING THE
[ct=5441.855] PRESSURE THIS TIM, AND
[ct=5443.648] MILLER OMENIHU THERE
[ct=5444.931] TO THE INSIDE.
[ct=5448.969] THAT RIGHT ARM UP
[ct=5449.505] AROUND HIS NECK.
[ct=5450.779] >> Al: MAKES IT A 2nd
[ct=5457.175] AND 17.
[ct=5459.961] 2 MINUTES LEFT IN THE
[ct=5464.081] STEPPING UP.
[ct=5466.716] HAS A
[ct=5469.743] INTO THE END ZONE,
[ct=5471.227] TOUCHDOWN BROCK
[ct=5475.240] BOWERS!
[ct=5477.259] WELL, WE’VE ALL HEARD
[ct=5477.646] HE IS SOMETHING
[ct=5478.401] SPECIAL, AND NOW HE’S
[ct=5480.080] PROVING IT.
[ct=5482.606] >> Kirk: HE SURE IS.
[ct=5483.746] AGAIN, THIS KID’S BEEN
[ct=5484.546] LIKE THIS.
[ct=5485.524] HE HASN’T CHANGED A
[ct=5486.885] BIT SINCE HE WAS A
[ct=5487.713] TRUE FRESHMAN, BODY
[ct=5488.426] SIZE.
[ct=5489.974] REMEMBER WE TALKED
[ct=5492.403] ABOUT DISRUPTING HIM
[ct=5493.087] AT IT LINE OF
[ct=5493.945] SCRIMMAGE?
[ct=5497.801] THEY DIDN’T DO IT
[ct=5503.059] CONNERS, THAT IS A
[ct=5503.658] TOUGH FOR HIS SIZE.
[ct=5504.491] HERE HE’S GETTING
[ct=5505.828] ISOLATED AGAINST A BIG
[ct=5507.479] TIGHT END, ONE-ON-ONE
[ct=5508.075] WOUCH MUCH HELP.
[ct=5509.304] AND WHAT A JOB BY
[ct=5510.269] O’CONNELL CLIMBING
[ct=5511.162] THAT POCKET TO BUY
[ct=5512.006] TIME AND PUTTING THE
[ct=5512.576] BALL RIGHT ON THE
[ct=5513.348] MONEY FOR THAT
[ct=5519.465] AFTER THE GAME SNOOP,
[ct=5520.849] AMAZON MUSIC LIVE.
[ct=5522.339] WHEN THE GAME ENDS
[ct=5523.859] LIVE, MUSIC BEGINS ON
[ct=5525.627] THIS BLACK FRIDAY.
[ct=5526.954] SUN GOING DOWN.
[ct=5529.201] KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI,
[ct=5533.291] TEMPERATURE IS 36
[ct=5535.932] DEGREES, AND A 6-POINT
[ct=5536.693] TO THE 30 AND TO
[ct=5539.009] >> GUYS, WE DIDN’T SEE
[ct=5541.260] GETTING ANY MEDICAL
[ct=5541.619] ATTENTION AFTER HE
[ct=5543.925] WALKED OFF THE FIELD
[ct=5544.534] SCRUNCHING THAT LEFT
[ct=5545.210] FIST.
[ct=5546.368] AS HE STUDIED THE
[ct=5547.416] TABLET ON THE
[ct=5549.425] SIDELINES, HE WAS
[ct=5550.948] MASSAGING HIS OWN
[ct=5551.290] HAND.
[ct=5552.209] HE THEN STOOD UP, TOOK
[ct=5553.377] A COUPLE OF PRACTICE
[ct=5554.093] THROWS.
[ct=5555.162] AND AS HE HANDLED THE
[ct=5556.010] BALL WITH HIS LEFT AND
[ct=5558.077] THEN THREW WITH THE
[ct=5559.397] RIGHT, HE DIDN’T SEE
[ct=5560.717] ANY IRRITATION IT
[ct=5561.282] SEEMED, AND THERE HE
[ct=5562.803] IS TAKING A LOOK AT
[ct=5564.027] >> Al: WELL, TAKE A
[ct=5567.585] LOOK, KEEP A CLOSE EYE
[ct=5568.432] ON HIM FROM THE 30
[ct=5569.738] YARD LINE AS HE STARTS
[ct=5570.198] THIS DRIVE WITH A
[ct=5572.007] HAND-OFFCH AND ABOUT A
[ct=5574.435] 4-YARD PICKUP BY
[ct=5577.266] >> Kirk: THE CHIEF HAD
[ct=5579.915] THAT RUN BY PACHECO.
[ct=5580.369] OUTSIDE OF THAT 9
[ct=5582.626] CARRIES, 11 YARDS.
[ct=5582.981] SO THE RAIDERS HAVE
[ct=5584.116] DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB
[ct=5586.577] OUTSIDE OF THE BIG RUN
[ct=5587.345] OF CONTAINING THAT RUN
[ct=5589.241] KELCE ALSO BIG FIRST
[ct=5590.751] QUARTER.
[ct=5590.926] 56 YARDS IN THE FIRST
[ct=5592.245] QUARTER ALONE.
[ct=5593.184] PATRICK GRAHAM HAS
[ct=5594.702] DONE A GOOD JOB
[ct=5595.231] PUTTING THE CLAMPS
[ct=5596.457] SINCE THAT FIRST
[ct=5597.965] QUARTER ONLY 37 YARDS.
[ct=5598.659] BUT WE’RE GETTING
[ct=5599.373] CLOSE TO THE FOURTH
[ct=5600.530] QUARTER WHICH IS WHEN
[ct=5601.900] MAHOMES IS KELCE
[ct=5604.143] USUALLY TAKE OVER.
[ct=5606.059] >> Al: A MINUTE LEFT
[ct=5607.359] IN THIS QUARTER.
[ct=5608.658] A LITTLE JUMP PASS BUT
[ct=5610.028] NOTHING IS HAPPENING
[ct=5610.885] MIGHT HAVE BEEN
[ct=5612.901] KAREEM HUNT TACKLED
[ct=5615.464] THERE BY MAXX CROSBY.
[ct=5618.058] A 6 ON THE PLAY.
[ct=5618.229] >> Kirk: HE DIALS UP
[ct=5621.946] THE LOOKS ON THIS
[ct=5623.661] OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=5624.969] THEY KEEP ATTACKING
[ct=5626.237] THAT LEFT SIDE.
[ct=5627.786] ONE-ON-ONE OR PRESSURE
[ct=5633.158] OFF THE EDGE.
[ct=5635.111] CAME OFF THAT NICKEL
[ct=5635.630] SPOT.
[ct=5637.815] CONFUSING MAHOMES.
[ct=5638.673] IT’S CONFUSING THE
[ct=5644.063] A 3rd AND 11.
[ct=5644.835] WANING SECONDS OF THE
[ct=5646.429] DEEP DROP, UNDER
[ct=5650.764] PRESSURE, AVOIDS THE
[ct=5653.047] SACK.
[ct=5654.863] THROW’S OFF BALANCE.
[ct=5656.020] DROPPED.
[ct=5656.234] HE HAD IT AND IT WAS
[ct=5658.066] MAXX CROSBY CHASING
[ct=5659.275] HIM, HAD THE FIRST
[ct=5660.413] DOWN, EXTENDED THE
[ct=5662.742] PASS WAS DROPPED.
[ct=5664.480] DROPPED BY HOPKINS.
[ct=5666.116] CROSBY -- YOU’RE GOING
[ct=5667.204] TO LOVE THIS.
[ct=5668.262] CROSBY GETS TO HIM,
[ct=5669.535] WORKS AROUND AND
[ct=5670.475] PUSHES AROUND TAYLOR.
[ct=5671.230] GOOD COVERAGE.
[ct=5671.970] LOOK AT HIM, HE’S
[ct=5673.613] CLIMBING AROUND HIS
[ct=5675.134] ANKLES.
[ct=5675.717] SOMEHOW LOCATES
[ct=5676.730] HOPKINS AND MAKES THIS
[ct=5677.351] THROW RIGHT ON THE
[ct=5679.155] MONEY.
[ct=5680.059] AND HE’S JUST NOT ABLE
[ct=5681.690] TO HOLD ONTO IT.
[ct=5682.753] >> Al: SO THE RAIDERS
[ct=5683.803] GET EXACTLY WHAT THEY
[ct=5688.665] HAD HOPED FOR, 3 AND
[ct=5691.303] THE KICK FIELDED AT
[ct=5695.883] ABDULLAH, BRINGS IT
[ct=5698.186] BACK TO ABOUT THE 31
[ct=5699.468] WITH 5 SECONDS TO PLAY
[ct=5707.855] IN THE QUARTER.
[ct=5709.808] ARAIZA THAT TIME WITH
[ct=5710.399] A PUNT.
[ct=5711.491] AFTER THE DROP PASS
[ct=5713.442] THE PUNT WAS 52 YARDS.
[ct=5714.568] AND THERE’S MAXX WITH
[ct=5716.368] THAT FRUSTRATION.
[ct=5716.901] >> Kirk: THERE’S
[ct=5719.041] JUST WORTH REMINDING
[ct=5719.835] PEOPLE WE’VE SAID IT A
[ct=5721.495] BUNCH, LET’S CONTINUE
[ct=5722.063] TO REMIND PEOPLE THIS
[ct=5724.168] CHIEFS TEAM HAS BEEN
[ct=5725.047] SO CLOSE.
[ct=5725.819] EIGHT TIMES
[ct=5728.118] ONE-POSSESSION GAMES.
[ct=5728.118] FIVE TIMES THEY’VE WON
[ct=5729.459] IN THE LAST PLAY OF
[ct=5732.368] O’CONNELL OUTSIDE THE
[ct=5733.128] NUMBERS, BETWEEN THE
[ct=5734.412] NUMBERS, MUCH BETTER
[ct=5736.436] GOING TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=5737.097] THAT’S OUR NEXT GEN
[ct=5741.745] STATS POWERED BY AWS.
[ct=5744.387] >> SO FROM THE 31 YARD
[ct=5745.696] LINE, THIS DRIVE
[ct=5746.462] STARTS ON THE GROUND.
[ct=5747.058] SLIPPING TO THE
[ct=5747.888] OUTSIDE, TRYING TO GET
[ct=5749.219] AROUND THE CORNER, AND
[ct=5750.051] HE DOES.
[ct=5751.392] NICE GAIN.
[ct=5753.850] AND SINCERELY THAT’S
[ct=5754.646] THE END OF THE THIRD
[ct=5756.501] QUARTER, AND KANSA
[ct=5760.826] ’85 KANSAS CITY BEAT
[ct=5762.124] SAINT

[ct=5788.368] THE OAKLAND RAIDERS
[ct=5789.651] NOW KNOWN AS THE LAS
[ct=5790.981] VEGAS RAIDERS, BUT
[ct=5793.989] THIS IS A BLAST FROM
[ct=5795.303] THE PAST.
[ct=5796.474] WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
[ct=5797.333] 58 YARDS.
[ct=5799.645] >> Kirk: WHAT A BALL
[ct=5800.008] BY AIDAN O’CONNELL.
[ct=5800.576] WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT
[ct=5801.272] HIM AND WHAT HE’S
[ct=5802.611] DOING.
[ct=5803.406] FACING SOME PRESSURE,
[ct=5804.002] BUT HE’S GETTING
[ct=5806.459] BALL OUT, AND HE’S
[ct=5806.694] GIVING THESE RECEIVERS
[ct=5807.036] A CHANCE.
[ct=5808.673] YOU’RE GOING TO HAVE
[ct=5810.574] TO RECOGNIZE SCOTT AND
[ct=5811.872] NORV TURNER FOR THIS
[ct=5814.344] PLAY CALL AND EMOTION
[ct=5814.718] AND HOW THAT MOTION
[ct=5817.337] IMPACTED IN CREATING
[ct=5820.006] THIS MATCHUP.
[ct=5820.229] >> Al: AND STEVE
[ct=5823.981] SPAGNUOLO STUNNED AS

[ct=5826.349] YARDS, CARLSON TO TRY

[ct=5835.305] SHADES OF THE OAKLAND
[ct=5836.627] RAIDERS RIGHT THERE.
[ct=5839.725] YOU NAME IT, THE WHOLE
[ct=5839.932] THING.
[ct=5840.801] WHAT’S GOING ON HERE?
[ct=5844.575] >> Kirk: AL, LOOK AT
[ct=5845.147] THE HOEGZ WITH
[ct=5845.854] THE HOEGMOTION WITH
[ct=5848.658] LOOK HOW KANSAS CITY

[ct=5850.050] NOW YOU HAVE A
[ct=5850.858] SPEEDSTER AGAINST A
[ct=5853.989] A GREAT BALL BUT GREAT
[ct=5860.715] JOB BY TUCKER.
[ct=5862.037] MOVE REID OVER, THAT’S
[ct=5862.659] EXACTLY WHAT THE
[ct=5863.939] RAIDERS WANTED, WHAT A
[ct=5865.041] JOB HERE WITH THE
[ct=5866.478] SPEED HERE BY TUCKER.
[ct=5867.822] HE’S AN UNDERSIZED GUY
[ct=5870.448] AT 5’9", BUT A LOT OF
[ct=5871.849] TIMES THESE VERTICAL
[ct=5872.618] THREATS THEY’RE
[ct=5874.640] TALLER, LONGER.
[ct=5874.832] THIS GUY’S A LITTLE
[ct=5876.223] SHORTER BUT HAS THAT
[ct=5877.258] NATURAL FEEL
[ct=5878.551] AND O’CONNELL’S GOT TO
[ct=5881.213] FEEL SO GOOD WITH HOW
[ct=5882.576] HE’S BATTLED BACK IN
[ct=5883.086] THIS FOOTBALL GAME TO
[ct=5884.170] GIVE THE RAIDERS THE
[ct=5886.136] LEAD.

[ct=5889.334] CALL TO GET HIM
[ct=5890.025] ISOLATED TO GIVE

[ct=5892.457] MAKE THAT THROW.
[ct=5894.319] WHAT A GAME.
[ct=5895.964] >> Al: REALLY A COMING

[ct=5897.716] THE TURNER FATHER AND

[ct=5899.871] COMING OF AGE GAME
[ct=5900.902] HERE FOR O’CONNELL.
[ct=5902.933] IF HE BECOMES THE GUY
[ct=5904.507] DOWN THE LINE, YOU
[ct=5905.251] LOOK BACK TO THIS DAY.
[ct=5905.790] >> Kirk: MOST
[ct=5906.392] IMPORTANT THING IS YOU
[ct=5907.562] LOOK INTO THE EYES
[ct=5908.367] THERE OF ONE OF THE
[ct=5910.018] BETTER PLAYERS IN THE
