[ct=6.032] OF THE GREEN BAY PACKERS.
[ct=9.779] THE ROOKIE KICKER -- WE SAW
[ct=11.106] MASON CROSBY WITH THE CHANGING
[ct=12.405] OF THE GUARD.
[ct=15.111] REYNOLDS IS BACK TO RECEIVE.
[ct=17.691] GREEN BAY WON THE TOSS AND
[ct=17.691] DEFERRED.
[ct=21.701] AND AWAY WE GO FROM LAMBEAU
[ct=23.109] FIELD STARTING AT THE 25 YARD
[ct=23.109] LINE.
[ct=27.012] JARED GOFF, NUMBER ONE PICK IN
[ct=31.059] 2016 BY THE RAMS, NUMBER ONE
[ct=32.348] OVERALL PICK AND THEN TRADED TO
[ct=35.058] DETROIT FOR MATTHEW STAFFORD AND
[ct=35.058] A BUNCH OF PICKS.
[ct=37.680] 70% COMPLETION.
[ct=44.390] FIVE TDS AND TD -- AND THREW THE
[ct=45.654] BALL INTO THE UPPER DECK.
[ct=51.168] HE THREW A HAIL MARY TO THE
[ct=51.168] CROWD.
[ct=52.330] DAVID MONTGOMERY STARTS IN TH
[ct=53.798] BACKFIELD.
[ct=56.324] FORMER BEAR.
[ct=57.722] HE GETS IT RIGHT AWAY.
[ct=59.079] HE WON'T GO ANYWHERE.
[ct=61.630] TAKEN DOWN BY NUMBER 91 FOR NO
[ct=64.328] GAIN AND IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN
[ct=65.666] AND 10.
[ct=69.720] KIRK: JARED GOFF WAS KIND OF THE
[ct=69.720] FORGOTTEN MAN IN THE TRADE WITH
[ct=71.009] STAFFORD.
[ct=73.654] THE RAMS WENT ON TO WIN THE
[ct=75.058] SUPER BOWL AND HE SAID IT WAS
[ct=76.271] HARD NOT TO TAKE IT PERSONALLY.
[ct=79.023] HE HAS BATTLED THROUGH AND I
[ct=80.331] WOULD ARGUE HE IS PLAYING THE
[ct=81.550] BEST FOOTBALL OF HIS CAREER OVER
[ct=84.198] THE LAST PART OF THE SECOND HALF
[ct=85.556] OF LAST YEAR AND INTO THIS YEAR.
[ct=88.327] A GREAT COMMAND IN THIS
[ct=89.577] JOHNSON OFFENSE.
[ct=92.216] AL: THE PLAY FAKE.
[ct=93.571] THE PAST INTO THE FLAT AND
[ct=95.009] NOTHING HAPPENING HERE EITHER.
[ct=100.315] THE CATCH IS MADE BY RAYMOND
[ct=101.506] TAKEN DOWN.
[ct=102.874] A GOOD START BY THE PACKER
[ct=105.506] DEFENSE AND IT IS A DOWN AND 12.
[ct=109.524] KIRK: GREEN BAY'S DEFENSE
[ct=110.970] ACCEPTING THE CHALLENGE THIS
[ct=110.970] WEEK IN THE SHORT WEEK FROM
[ct=112.101] THEIR COACH.
[ct=114.757] TALKING ALL WEEK ABOUT THE
[ct=116.239] PHYSICALITY OF DETROIT COMING
[ct=117.414] OUT EARLY WITH A LOT OF SPEED.
[ct=121.609] AL: GREEN BAY DEFENSE SHUTTING
[ct=124.238] DOWN THE SAINTS IN THE SECOND
[ct=124.238] HALF.
[ct=128.272] THIRD AND LONG IN A TIGHT
[ct=129.682] FORMATION.
[ct=133.646] PACKERS RUSH FIVE.
[ct=138.832] GOLF STEPS -- GOFF STEPS UP AND
[ct=141.565] IS PICKED OFF BY RUDY FORD WHO
[ct=144.239] TAKES IT DEEP INTO LIONS
[ct=144.239] TERRITORY.
[ct=148.157] GOFF WHO WENT 10 GAMES WITHOUT A
[ct=150.888] PICK NOW HAS AN INTE
[ct=152.121] THREE CONSECUTIVE GAMES.
[ct=156.192] DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR OF GREEN
[ct=156.192] BAY.
[ct=160.228] THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATORS IN
[ct=161.651] THE NFL MOVE AROUND GUYS AND
[ct=165.708] MAKE YOU THINK AFTER THE SNAP.
[ct=165.708] THEY SAT IN ZONE.
[ct=169.775] NOTHING REALLY SHOULD HAVE
[ct=171.155] TRICKED JARED GOFF.
[ct=173.737] THERE WAS A SAFETY IN THE
[ct=175.017] UNDERNEATH COVERAGE.
[ct=177.643] YOU SEE JARED GOFF'S EYES
[ct=179.181] WORKING AROUND.
[ct=181.656] IT LOOKS LIKE HE WAS TRYING TO
[ct=184.351] GET IT TO SAINT BROWN AND THROWS
[ct=185.677] IT LATE OVER THE MIDDLE AND FORD
[ct=186.954] IS RIGHT THERE.
[ct=191.048] AL: BACK FROM INJURIES.
[ct=193.603] THEY ARE IN THIS SET FROM THE 14
[ct=193.603] YARD LINE.
[ct=196.259] LOVE HAS TIME.
[ct=197.611] THE SECONDARY DOES ITS JOB
[ct=197.611] TAKING OFF.
[ct=201.684] HE HAS THE ABILITY.
[ct=204.246] THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE, SECOND
[ct=204.246] DOWN AND 10.
[ct=208.229] JARED LOVE WAS PICKED IN THE
[ct=210.870] DRAFT IN 2020.
[ct=213.556] HE'S SHOCKED AARON RODGERS.
[ct=218.785] HE HAD TO WAIT THREE YEARS BUT
[ct=220.258] NOW HE GETS HIS OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=225.576] HE SAID UTAH STATE WAS THE ONLY
[ct=228.118] SCHOOL.
[ct=230.964] KIRK: HE GREW UP IN THE SAME
[ct=230.964] AREA AS JOSH ALLEN.
[ct=236.249] AL: SECOND AND 10.
[ct=275.959] HIS THIRD
[ct=277.427] SACK OF THE YEAR.
[ct=281.480] AL: THIRD AND 19TH.
[ct=285.573] RUSH FOUR.
[ct=289.481] PAST CAUGHT -- PASS CAUGHT.
[ct=294.762] ROMEO DOBBS THAT CATCH AND IN
[ct=296.027] COMES THE FIELD GOAL UNIT.
[ct=298.669] KIRK: PRETTY GOOD JOB BY THE
[ct=301.350] DETROIT DEFENSE CONSIDERING THE
[ct=302.658] HOLD THEY WERE IN AFTER THAT
[ct=302.658] INTERCEPTION.
[ct=306.607] GOOD PRESSURE WITH THAT SACK
[ct=307.942] PUTTING THEM AWAY BEHIN
[ct=309.474] STICKS FORCING THE FIELD GOAL.
[ct=313.308] AL: THE 34 YARD ATTEMPT.
[ct=314.716] HE WAS A SIX ROUND DRAFT OUT OF
[ct=314.716] AUBURN.
[ct=318.610] CROSBY HAS BEEN HERE FOR THE
[ct=319.962] LAST 16 YEARS.
[ct=322.612] THE HOLDER IS ALSO A ROOKIE.
[ct=326.612] THE TURNOVER HAS PAID OFF WITH A
[ct=327.896] FIELD GOAL.
[ct=331.897] THREE MINUTES INTO THE GAME AND
[ct=334.597] IT IS GREEN BAY, THREE AND
[ct=335.947] DETROIT NOTHING.
[ct=338.516] IS HE STREAMING IT FROM YOUR
[ct=339.930] ROOM?
[ct=343.852] AL: THAT IS MORE ROOM, NOT MINE.
[ct=347.824] KICKING OFF FOR THE SECOND TIME.
[ct=350.594] CARLSON.
[ct=355.900] REYNOLDS LETS IT GO.
[ct=357.120] ONCE AGAIN JARED GOFF COMES OUT
[ct=359.804] STARTING AT THE 25 YARD LINE.
[ct=362.529] ONE KICK IN EACH OF HIS LAST
[ct=365.226] THREE GAMES -- IN THE LAST 10
[ct=368.949] GAMES HE HAD 383 CONSECUTIVE
[ct=368.949] PASSES WITHOUT AN INTERCEPTION.
[ct=374.694] THE THIRD LONGEST OF ALL TIME.
[ct=375.687] EXCEEDED ONLY BY AARON RODGERS
[ct=376.008] AND TOM BRADY.
[ct=380.624] KIRK: WITH DECKER BACK, ONE OF
[ct=384.619] THE TOP OFFENSIVE LINES IN THE
[ct=385.591] LEAGUE AND THEY HAVE TO GET THE
[ct=386.540] RUN GAME GOING TONIGHT.
[ct=390.430] AL: MONTGOMERY PICKS UP TWO.
[ct=395.033] DAVID IS IN HIS FIFTH YEAR IN
[ct=395.718] THE LEAGUE.
[ct=398.916] PRESTON MAKES THE STOP, SECOND
[ct=399.926] AND EIGHT.
[ct=403.341] KIRK: ONE OF THE GREAT BATTLES
[ct=405.330] WITHIN THE GAME WILL BE THE
[ct=407.981] OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=412.604] MAKING IT TOUGH AT THE LINE OF
[ct=412.928] SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=414.583] THEY HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED ALL
[ct=416.764] WEEK TO MATCH THAT PHYSICALITY.
[ct=420.636] AL: THE ROOKIE GIVES COMES IN --
[ct=426.535] GIBBS COMES IN, THE NUMBER 12
[ct=427.210] PICK FROM ALABAMA.
[ct=427.542] THEY LOVE HIM.
[ct=432.234] HE WATCHED HIM PLAY A LOT OF
[ct=433.307] FOOTBALL IN COLLEGE STARTING AT
[ct=433.636] GEORGIA TECH.
[ct=438.223] KIRK: NICK SABIN NEEDED A BACK
[ct=440.537] AND HE WENT TO TUSCALOOSA AND
[ct=442.220] HAD A BRILLIANT ONE YEAR AT
[ct=442.508] ALABAMA.
[ct=446.171] NOT ONLY DID HE SHOW AN ABILITY
[ct=447.191] TO RUN ON THE PERIMETER BUT
[ct=449.836] BETWEEN THE TACKLES HE COULD GET
[ct=449.836] OFF OF YARDS.
[ct=451.439] HE IS A THREE DOWN BACK IN THE
[ct=454.127] NFL.
[ct=455.436] HE EVEN CAN LINE UP AT TIMES AS
[ct=455.813] A RECEIVER.
[ct=457.786] AL: THEY BRING BACK IN
[ct=459.492] MONTGOMERY.
[ct=462.330] AN EXTRA TIGHT END.
[ct=464.734] HE THRUST FORWARD UP TO THE 36
[ct=464.734] YARD LINE FOR
[ct=467.318] DOWN.
[ct=471.496] KIRK: THREE TIGHT ENDS, SHORT
[ct=471.811] YARDAGE YOU NEED A GOOD PUSH.
[ct=475.951] IN BAY COMING OFF THE BALL,
[ct=480.089] NUMBER 93 THAT TIME DOING A GOOD
[ct=481.048] JOB WITH JUST ENOUGH ROOM FOR
[ct=485.074] HE AND GIBBS TOGETHER ARE A
[ct=488.192] FORMIDABLE DUO IN THAT BACKFIELD
[ct=488.545] FOR THE LIONS.
[ct=493.430] AL: GIBBS IS BACK IN.
[ct=495.830] HE GETS CRUSHED AS HE MAKES THE
[ct=497.106] GRAB.
[ct=498.713] IT IS WALKER MAKING THE TACKLE.
[ct=504.827] YOU TRY TO GET A GUY OUT IN
[ct=505.884] SPACE AND THAT SPACE CLOSES
[ct=506.254] QUICKLY.
[ct=510.078] KIRK: I THINK WALKER IS SEEING
[ct=512.100] THE GAME A LOT FASTER LIKE MOST
[ct=513.051] GUYS IN THEIR SECOND YEAR.
[ct=517.422] READING THE EYES AND TAKING AWAY
[ct=518.718] SPACE WITH QUICKNESS.
[ct=521.426] I THINK HE IS SEEING THE GAME A
[ct=524.049] LOT FASTER AND REACTING MUCH
[ct=525.412] QUICKER IN YEAR NUMBER TWO.
[ct=528.728] AL: ANOTHER GEORGIA BULLDOG IS
[ct=528.728] WALKER.
[ct=533.666] TJ SLATON TAKES CARE OF
[ct=536.016] DETROIT NOW WITH A THIRD DOWN.
[ct=539.026] KIRK: YOU'RE USED TO COMING AND
[ct=539.629] WATCHING GREEN BAY WITH KENNY
[ct=541.897] CLARK MAKING A DIFFERENCE
[ct=545.601] OUTFRONT BUT THEY HAVE MOVED HIM
[ct=546.320] AWAY FROM THE NOSE.
[ct=551.213] SLATON, YOU SEE HIM A LOT EARLY
[ct=551.522] MAKING PLAYS.
[ct=555.191] AL: THIRD DOWN AND 5-4 DETROIT.
[ct=560.278] PACKERS ON TOP 3-0 TAKING
[ct=561.640] ADVANTAGE OF THE INTERCEPTION.
[ct=564.609] GOFF RETREATS AND FIRE IS OVER
[ct=564.935] THE MIDDLE.
[ct=567.238] CAUGHT ON THE RUN.
[ct=570.955] INSIDE THE 30! AND THAT IS SAM
[ct=573.601] LAPORTA.
[ct=574.913] A GREAT-LOOKING ROOKIE TIGHT END
[ct=576.768] OUT OF IOWA WHERE THEY GROW
[ct=578.923] THEM.
[ct=581.928] KIRK: YOU CAN GO MAN TO MAN
[ct=582.978] BECAUSE OF THE MOTION.
[ct=586.975] GOFF KNOWS WHO HE WANTS TO GO TO
[ct=587.272] RIGHT AWAY.
[ct=591.006] SECOND YEAR, THIS BEN JOHNSON
[ct=593.657] OFFENSE ESPECIALLY ON THIRD DOWN
[ct=594.307] -- HE HAS A GOOD IDEA OF WHERE
[ct=596.282] HE WANTS TO GO WITH THE
[ct=596.282] FOOTBALL.
[ct=598.503] NOT BAD COVERAGE BY DOUGLAS.
[ct=602.958] ROOKIE TIGHT END HAD THE BIG
[ct=603.241] PLAY LAST WEEK AND GETS THE
[ct=603.568] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=605.309] AL: 35 YARDS.
[ct=609.806] GOFF -- SAINT BROWN MAKING THE
[ct=617.799] GRAB! AMON-RA ST. BROWN -- 35,
[ct=621.784] 24!
[ct=622.104] LEAPING RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF
[ct=624.731] SOME FANS AND DETROIT TAKES THE
[ct=625.057] LEAD.
[ct=629.052] KIRK: THE DIFFERENCE IS NOT THE
[ct=630.403] TURNOVERS BUT HOW HE RESPONDS TO
[ct=632.412] LOOK AT THE COVERAGE BY GREEN
[ct=636.375] LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE
[ct=636.968] COVERAGE -- A LITTLE SLIP,
[ct=639.688] MAN-TO-MAN GOES DOWN AND AN EASY
[ct=640.409] READ.
[ct=645.691] DOUGLAS IS LOCKED UP ON BROWN
[ct=647.691] BUT A NICE JOB OF RESPONDING TO
[ct=648.007] THE INTERCEPTION BY JARED GOFF.
[ct=651.614] AL: A 100 YARD GAME LAST WEEK
[ct=655.302] AND THAT KICK IS JUST GOOD OFF
[ct=655.939] THE FOOT OF RILEY PATTERSON.
[ct=662.200] BACK COMES GOFF AFTER THE PICK.
[ct=664.814] DETROIT 41ST TRIP IN
[ct=665.096] HERE?
[ct=667.527] AL: THEY HAVE TAKEN THAT TO A
[ct=669.295] NEW LEVEL NOW.
[ct=673.429] KIRK: DETROIT, BOTTOM RIGHT,
[ct=674.500] TRYING TO GET INVOLVED IN IT.
[ct=678.541] AL: A LOT OF LIONS FANS HERE
[ct=678.918] TONIGHT.
[ct=683.486] TAKES IT AT THE GOAL LINE.
[ct=683.829] A GOOD RETURN MAN.
[ct=690.214] TAKES INTO THE 20 YARD LINE.
[ct=692.793] LUCAS MAKING THE TACKLE.
[ct=699.420] JORDAN LOVE, THE ONE ISSUE HE
[ct=702.101] HAS HAD THIS YEAR IS COMPLETION
[ct=702.402] PERCENTAGES.
[ct=705.021] ONLY A LITTLE OVER 50%.
[ct=707.376] KIRK: A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO
[ct=710.386] WITH NOT HAVING WATSON OUT THERE
[ct=713.151] AND THEY HAVE THROWN THE BALL
[ct=714.532] DOWNFIELD A LOT THIS YEAR.
[ct=717.180] WITH ALL OF THE YOUTH ON THE
[ct=718.521] PERIMETER THEY ARE STILL TRYING
[ct=720.223] TO FIND THE RHYTHM WITH THE NEW
[ct=720.620] QUARTERBACK.
[ct=726.233] AL: WATSON, NUMBER NINE,
[ct=728.803] SECOND-YEAR OUT OF NORTH DAKOTA
[ct=728.803] STATE.
[ct=730.143] HE HAD A REALLY GOOD ROOKIE
[ct=730.143] SEASON.
[ct=734.146] LOVE -- LOOK OUT.
[ct=736.802] HE IS SWALLOWED UP AT
[ct=739.742] ISAIAH BALKS ROARING
[ct=741.071] HIM DOWN.
[ct=746.357] KIRK: ISAIAH BUGS IS KNOWN FOR
[ct=746.357] POWER BUT HE HAS SOME
[ct=753.291] QUICKS TO GO WITH IT AND HE
[ct=755.670] BULRUSH IS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF
[ct=757.291] NEWMAN AND JOSH MYERS.
[ct=759.661] I DON'T KNOW HOW LOVE HELD ONTO
[ct=762.256] THE FOOTBALL WITH BUGGS TRYING
[ct=762.586] TO KNOCK IT AWAY.
[ct=766.867] AL: HE IS IN HIS FIFTH SEASON
[ct=767.492] AND ONLY HIS SECOND CAREER SACK.
[ct=770.830] SECOND AND 16.
[ct=772.461] THE PAST IS BROKEN UP -- THE
[ct=777.455] PASS IS BROKEN OUT.
[ct=778.085] THIRD DOWN AND 16 FOR THE
[ct=778.455] PACKERS.
[ct=781.784] KIRK: WITH JORDAN LOVE, YOU SEE
[ct=785.821] THE YOUNG QUARTERBACKS, WE HAVE
[ct=786.507] SEEN A FEW PLAYING AND THE
[ct=788.393] DEBATE IS, IS IT BETTER TO SIT
[ct=789.739] AROUND FOR A COUPLE YEARS TO GET
[ct=790.030] READY?
[ct=795.054] IN HIS CASE HE GOT TO LEARN FROM
[ct=796.367] A FUTURE HALL OF FAMER
[ct=797.711] RODGERS.
[ct=799.514] HE TALKED ABOUT THE ATTENTION TO
[ct=801.679] DETAIL THAT HE LEARNED AND THE
[ct=801.956] FILM STUDY.
[ct=804.378] HE SAID THE GREATEST THING I
[ct=805.362] TOOK AWAY FROM HIM IS HIS
[ct=809.698] CONSISTENCY WITH THE DAILY PREP.
[ct=811.070] WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM IN
[ct=811.402] THE LAST THREE YEARS.
[ct=814.022] AL: THIRD AND 16.
[ct=816.657] DEEP DROP.
[ct=819.400] EVERYONE IS COVERED THE FLAG IS
[ct=821.984] THE PAST IS INCOMPLETE -- THE
[ct=825.301] PASS IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=829.393] >> THE RULING ON THE FIELD IS AN
[ct=830.082] INCOMPLETE PASS.
[ct=833.388] KIRK: RUNYON ARATHI SAW
[ct=835.663] HUTCHINSON GO BY HIM.
[ct=837.521] >> THE PENALTY IS DECLINED.
[ct=843.616] KIRK: AND NOW, HE IS LIMPING OFF
[ct=843.616] THE FIELD.
[ct=844.267] A TOUGH START FOR HIM.
[ct=847.039] AL: THEY ARE WITHOUT THEIR LEFT
[ct=850.349] TACKLE WHO WENT ON INJURED
[ct=850.982] RESERVE TODAY AND JENKINS, THE
[ct=853.027] LEFT GUARD, IS ALSO OUT.
[ct=855.979] KIRK: WHAT IS IMPRESSIVE IS THEY
[ct=857.301] HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OVERCOME THAT
[ct=860.987] IN TWO OF THEIR THREE GAMES AND
[ct=862.282] HATE SEEING RUNYON LIMPING OFF.
[ct=866.267] AL: SO MANY TEAMS IN THE SAME
[ct=866.608] SITUATION.
[ct=869.259] THE OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=873.429] THE WHISTLE STOPPED PLAY.
[ct=878.275] KIRK: PENALTIES HURT THIS GREEN
[ct=880.916] BAY TEAM LAST WEEK AND THEY WILL
[ct=881.209] PUSH THEM BACK FIVE MORE YARDS.
[ct=886.844] >> FALSE START, NUMBER 55.
[ct=887.146] FIVE YARD PENALTY.
[ct=896.142] AL: THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE NOW
[ct=898.406] GOES BACK TO THE NINE.
[ct=905.084] RAYMOND SETS UP AT HIS OWN 40.
[ct=910.390] THE PUNTER SKIES ONE.
[ct=913.589] A GOOD PUNT.
[ct=914.356] BACKING UP,
[ct=927.616] THEY ALMOST GAVE UP SOME POINTS
[ct=929.257] AFTER THIS PICK BUT ONLY A FIELD
[ct=929.622] GOAL OF.
[ct=933.315] AND THEN THE TOUCHDOWN TO SAINT
[ct=933.664] BROWN.
[ct=935.581] A GREAT ANSWER FROM DETROIT AND
[ct=937.804] THEIR QUARTERBACK JARED GOFF.
[ct=940.917] A GLIMPSE INTO THE FUTURE WITH
[ct=946.870] GIBBS AND SAINT BROWN.
[ct=947.566] SUCH SKILL.
[ct=951.515] AL: GOFF PLAYING HIS BEST
[ct=953.175] HE LED THE RAMS INTO THE SUPER
[ct=956.056] BOWL IN 2018.
[ct=958.177] THAT PASS IS TO HYPE YOUR IF YOU
[ct=960.937] LOOK AT THE TRADE AGAIN,
[ct=962.601] OBVIOUSLY IT TURNED OUT GREAT
[ct=963.850] FOR THE RAMS.
[ct=966.538] THEY TRADED FOR STAFFORD.
[ct=967.568] THEY WENT ON TO WIN THAT SUPER
[ct=968.477] BOWL.
[ct=971.879] BUT NOW, IF YOU LOOK TO THE
[ct=974.575] FUTURE, AND GOFF'S YOUNGER THAN
[ct=979.867] KIRK: WHAT A MOVE BY BRIDE
[ct=982.581] HOLMES TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN --
[ct=989.179] BRAD HOLMES TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
[ct=989.811] IT IS A YOUNG TEAM GOING IN A
[ct=990.137] GREAT DIRECTION AND LUCKY TO
[ct=992.182] HAVE GOFF THERE.
[ct=996.157] AL: SECOND AND 10, NICE BURST
[ct=1000.135] FOR A GAIN OF SEVEN BY GIBBS TO
[ct=1002.050] MAKE IT THIRD AND THREE.
[ct=1004.416] KIRK: I REALLY THINK
[ct=1008.089] CHANGED THE IMAGE.
[ct=1009.411] I THINK IT STARTED, THERE IS
[ct=1012.379] RUNYON GETTING THE ANKLE TAPED,
[ct=1014.730] I THINK IT STARTED A YEAR AGO
[ct=1016.689] WITH THE PERSONALITY OF DAN
[ct=1017.367] CAMPBELL COMING OUT.
[ct=1020.131] A LOT OF PEOPLE DID NOT KNOW A
[ct=1022.690] LOT ABOUT DETROIT AND DAN
[ct=1023.323] CAMPBELL AND HIS PERSONALITY AND
[ct=1024.007] WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO
[ct=1026.899] COMMUNICATE AND SELL WITH THE
[ct=1028.285] CULTURE CHANGE.
[ct=1028.913] I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT,
[ct=1030.906] I WANT TO PLAY FOR THAT GUY WITH
[ct=1031.263] THAT KIND OF APPROACH.
[ct=1034.061] AL: HE WANTED TO BITE OFF THE
[ct=1036.221] KNEECAPS.
[ct=1037.555] LIKE YOU SAID IN THE PRESS

[ct=2358.141] THE TENDENCY TO OVER ANALYZE.
[ct=2364.506] TELLING HIM EXACTLY WHAT HE'S
[ct=2364.801] LOOKING FOR.

[ct=2924.676] I'M TALKING THIS YEAR.
[ct=2927.721] THE REASON THEY ARE REAL IS
[ct=2928.940] BECAUSE THE OFFENSE OF LINE.

[ct=3096.936] GUY BUT HE'S ATHLETIC ENOUGH TO
[ct=3100.441] GET AWAY FROM THIS AND KEEP HIS
[ct=3100.441] EYES DOWNFIELD.

[ct=3187.308] KIRK: IT'S BAD ENOUGH YOU ARE
[ct=3188.354] DOWN 24-3.
[ct=3190.481] YOU HAVE NEGATIVE TWO YARDS
[ct=3190.481] STILL.
[ct=3193.588] AL: THEY PICKED UP SOME.
[ct=3197.047] KIRK: OBVIOUSLY NOT A GREAT
[ct=3197.379] NIGHT.
[ct=3197.710] THEY ARE BODY BLOWING YOU.
[ct=3201.520] EVEN MORE CHALLENGING
[ct=3204.005] EMOTIONALLY WHEN YOU GET HIT AT
[ct=3204.005] THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=3209.428] AL: THEY HAVE'S CONKING NOW.
[ct=3210.932] SECOND AND SEVEN -- SECOND AND

[ct=3228.617] NEXGEN STATS POWERED BY AWS.
[ct=3229.562] IT'S THE LION’S DEFENSE.
[ct=3233.969] YOU THINK THEY'VE BEEN BLITZING
[ct=3234.397] ALL NIGHT BUT THEY ARE NOT.
[ct=3234.669] WHY SHOULD HE?
[ct=3237.048] 46%.
[ct=3239.919] HUTCHERSON HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE
[ct=3241.125] PLACE GETTING INTO THAT
[ct=3243.010] MCNEIL HAS BEEN IN THE
[ct=3246.791] EVERYONE OF THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=3247.608] LINEMAN HAS STRUGGLED.
[ct=3249.097] YOU THINK IT WOULD BE COMING
[ct=3249.515] FROM THE LEFT SIDE BUT IT'S NOT.
[ct=3253.600] THE DEFENSIVE PRESSURE AND THE
[ct=3254.449] WAY THAT HE'S BEEN ABLE TO
[ct=3255.311] DESIGN THE PLAN, THEY'VE
[ct=3257.476] ATTACKED FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE
[ct=3258.470] , HAVING THEIR WAY OF THINGS.
[ct=3260.439] AL: IT'S INTERESTING.
[ct=3262.882] GREEN BAY WILL CALL A TIMEOUT
[ct=3268.463] THEY ARE IN A NO MAN'S LAND.
[ct=3269.681] THEY WANT TO GET OFF THE FIELD
[ct=3270.451] AND BACK INTO THE LOCKER ROOM.
[ct=3272.806] YOU ARE PLAYING WITH FIRE HERE.
[ct=3277.225] LETTING THEM HAVE THE EXTRA
[ct=3278.788] THIRD AND 6.
[ct=3281.113] FALLING DOWN THAT TIME.
[ct=3284.581] DROPPING TO HIS KNEES.
[ct=3284.581] THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=3291.230] KIRK: THAT ONE GUY WHO IS
[ct=3293.830] COMPETING HIS TAIL OFF IS 52.
[ct=3299.163] HE'S BEEN RELENTLESS IN HIS OWN
[ct=3299.839] RIGHT, ESPECIALLY ON THE THIRD
[ct=3303.520] DOWN GOING UP AGAINST DECKER AND
[ct=3304.719] WINNING THE BATTLE, GETTING INTO
[ct=3305.063] THE BACKFIELD.

[ct=3314.169] AL: RILEY PATTERSON CAME OVER IN
[ct=3315.726] A PLAYED -- TRADE WITH THE
[ct=3316.056] JAGUARS.
[ct=3318.308] THE KICK IS GOOD.
[ct=3318.945] JUST INSIDE THE LEFT UPRIGHT.
[ct=3323.038] WE CAN TELL YOU, THE FALCONS AND
[ct=3326.169] JAGUARS ARE GOING TO BE
[ct=3330.271] TRANSFORMING INTO THE WORLD OF

[ct=3337.145] EASTERN ON ESPN PLUS.
[ct=3342.679] WHAT IF YOU GOT?
[ct=3346.987] KAYLEE: THE PACKERS HAVE -- NEED
[ct=3348.307] ALL THE HELP THEY CAN GET.
[ct=3349.006] WE WATCH THE TIGHT END WALK OFF
[ct=3351.818] HE'S BEING EVALUATED UNDER
[ct=3352.508] CONCUSSION PROTOCOL.
[ct=3355.133] AL: GOOD.
[ct=3355.133] THEY LIKE HIM A LOT.
[ct=3359.416] OREGON STATE OFF TO A GOOD
[ct=3359.416] START.
[ct=3364.718] HE'S BACK, BEING CHECKED OUT.
[ct=3370.324] KIRK: HE HAS TO COME UP WITH A
[ct=3373.444] WAY TO HELP THE OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=3378.543] YOU CAN MOVE THE LAUNCH POINT,
[ct=3379.885] MOVE THE POCKET AROUND, GET THEM
[ct=3381.680] AWAY FROM THE PRESSURE, THE
[ct=3381.680] SCREAMS.
[ct=3384.874] ANYTHING TO GET JORDAN LOVE INTO
[ct=3385.518] SOME KIND OF RHYTHM.
[ct=3403.830] AL: YOU KNOW, HIS RECEIVERS ARE
[ct=3403.830] SO YOUNG.
[ct=3404.494] THEY ARE EITHER ROOKIES OR
[ct=3404.770] SECOND-YEAR GUYS.
[ct=3407.402] IT'S A KITTY COOLER.
[ct=3410.932] THAT WIDE ROLE WAS LIKE ROBBERY.
[ct=3417.907] KIRK: THEY'VE BEEN WORKING
[ct=3418.643] WITHOUT WANTS IN LAST COUPLE
[ct=3419.075] GAMES.
[ct=3422.080] HE'S BACK WITHOUT AARON JONES.
[ct=3424.861] WE THOUGHT, THEY HAVE SOME MORE
[ct=3425.140] EXPLOSIVE PAY MAKERS.
[ct=3427.993] THEY CAN'T GET A PLAY CALLED
[ct=3428.357] BECAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING UP
[ct=3428.718] FRONT.
[ct=3431.041] AL: EXACTLY.
[ct=3431.426] TOO MUCH PRESSURE.
[ct=3434.628] KIRK: HUTCHERSON ON THE INSIDE.
[ct=3441.585] AL: BAD TIME THEY STOP THEM.
[ct=3447.265] SECOND DOWN AND 5.
[ct=3452.674] A COUPLE OF TIMEOUTS.
[ct=3453.875] NOT USING THEM HERE.
[ct=3455.153] LOOK OUT.
[ct=3458.084] OUT OF TROUBLE FOR THE MOMENT.
[ct=3461.858] AND THEN YOU'VE GOT JOHN
[ct=3462.567] KRASINSKI BURYING HIM AS HE
[ct=3462.987] THROWS IT AWAY.
[ct=3467.359] KIRK: HE SAYS, LET ME GET IN ON
[ct=3467.359] THE ACT.
[ct=3468.220] IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT MCNEIL.
[ct=3471.675] THEY MOVE HUTCHERSON TO THE
[ct=3471.959] INSIDE THERE OVER THE LAST --
[ct=3472.299] LEFT GUARD.
[ct=3475.732] IT'S THE OTHER SIDE, A GOOD
[ct=3475.732] EFFORT.
[ct=3480.657] FINISHING ON THAT PLAY.
[ct=3493.580] WE ASKED IF HUTCHERSON LIKES
[ct=3493.960] BEING MOVED TO THE INSIDE.
[ct=3494.782] HE SAID AT FIRST, I WASN'T
[ct=3495.487] REALLY EXCITED ABOUT BEING ASKED
[ct=3495.910] TO MOVE IN THERE.
[ct=3497.673] IF IT HELPS THE TEAM, I’
[ct=3497.938] IF IT HELPS THE TEAM, I'M
[ct=3498.909] STARTING TO UNDERSTAND IT.
[ct=3501.141] HE HAS GOOD LATERAL QUICKNESS.
[ct=3504.572] IT SUBMITS -- IT'S A MISMATCH
[ct=3504.572] FOR HIM AGAINST THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=3504.856] GUARD.
[ct=3510.330] AL: PACKER FANS HAVEN'T
[ct=3513.428] WITNESSED MANY FIRST HALF LIKE
[ct=3513.800] THIS.
[ct=3523.784] THINK ABOUT THIS.
[ct=3526.277] THE LIONS ARE TRYING TO WIN
[ct=3528.922] GAMES INTO OF THE TOUGH PLACES
[ct=3529.322] IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=3538.194] KIRK: I THINK THAT GAME AGAINST
[ct=3539.432] THE CHIEF SCOTT THE ENTIRE LEAKS
[ct=3540.304] ATTENTION.
[ct=3541.424] THE WAY THE GAME IS PLAYED, HOW
[ct=3541.836] ATHLETIC THEY LOOK.
[ct=3544.392] THEN YOU FOLLOW IT UP WITH A
[ct=3546.272] GAME LIKE THIS IN LAMBEAU AT
[ct=3546.679] THIS STAGE.
[ct=3549.859] AL: PEOPLE MAY DETROIT THE IT
[ct=3550.533] TEAM, LOOKING OUT FOR THESE
[ct=3550.943] GUYS.
[ct=3555.630] DETROIT WILL TAKE A TIMEOUT
[ct=3559.494] THIS WAS A HOT TEAM AT THE END
[ct=3559.814] OF LAST YEAR.
[ct=3569.099] CAMPBELL STARTED HIS CAREER AT
[ct=3569.099] 19-1.
[ct=3573.476] ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEY GET HOT
[ct=3574.114] PURE GET TRYING TO MAKE IT THREE
[ct=3574.506] OUT OF FOUR THIS YEAR.
[ct=3576.257] YOU ARE RIGHT.
[ct=3581.902] KIRK: AGAIN, YOU GET THE PICK
[ct=3582.288] SIX.
[ct=3584.129] SOME OF THESE YOUNGER PLAYERS
[ct=3584.407] STARTING TO MAKE PLAYS.
[ct=3586.835] THEY ARE NOT JUST WINNING THE
[ct=3586.835] GAME.
[ct=3588.546] THEY LOOK ATHLETIC.
[ct=3591.488] THEY LOOK LIKE THEY ARE THE
[ct=3591.868] AGGRESSOR.
[ct=3597.100] HOW THEY RESPONDED TO THAT LOSS,
[ct=3597.100] THEY CAME BACK LAST WEEK AGAINST
[ct=3598.753] ATLANTA, DOMINATING THE GAME.
[ct=3600.746] HERE THEY ARE AGAIN.
[ct=3602.507] UP 27-3 AT THE HALF.
[ct=3607.280] AL: ATHLETIC AND VERY PHYSICAL.
[ct=3610.649] THAT IS WHATEVER THAT IS.
[ct=3610.649] THERE'S THE FLAG.
[ct=3614.137] DON JACOBS COVERING ON THE PLAY.
[ct=3614.530] THREE SECONDS.
[ct=3624.112] >> PASS INTERFERENCE.
[ct=3624.421] NUMBER 23.
[ct=3628.129] AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3632.552] AL: DOBBS HAD THAT BIG CATCH
[ct=3632.863] LAST WEEK.
[ct=3634.975] ENDED UP BEING A GAME-WINNING
[ct=3634.975] TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=3635.589] LOOK HOW TIGHT THAT COVERAGES.
[ct=3638.940] I CAN SEE WHAT JACOBS IS SAYING.
[ct=3641.057] HE WAS TIGHT ON HIS COVERAGE
[ct=3646.149] MAYBE THE VERY END OF THAT ROUTE
[ct=3647.279] HE'S FRUSTRATED.
[ct=3648.459] HE THOUGHT HE WAS IN HIS POCKET.
[ct=3652.640] AL: NOTHING TO DO HERE BUT
[ct=3653.911] A HAIL MARY, ASSUMING HE HAS
[ct=3654.246] MORE THAN 2.5 SECONDS.
[ct=3660.667] FINAL PLAY OF THE HALF, BARRING
[ct=3661.485] THE DEFENSIVE FOUL.
[ct=3663.632] FORGET ABOUT IT.
[ct=3666.017] HE'S GOING TO GET SACKED.
[ct=3668.809] THAT WILL TAKE MORE YARDAGE OFF
[ct=3669.167] THE TOTAL.
[ct=3671.823] OH BOY.
[ct=3675.479] THE SOUND YOU DON'T HEAR HERE.
[ct=3677.689] KIRK: IT’
[ct=3678.101] KIRK: IT'S HARD TO THROW A HAIL
[ct=3680.382] MARY WHEN YOU NEED A LITTLE BIT
[ct=3682.308] OF TIME AND HARRIS GOES RIGHT BY
[ct=3687.546] HUTCHERSON, THE ENERGY HE BRINGS
[ct=3687.936] TO THE DEFENSE.
[ct=3691.767] AL: 27-3 DETROIT AT THE BREAK.
[ct=3695.111] STATE FARM HALFTIME SHOW, COMING
[ct=3695.398] RIGHT UP.
[ct=3696.080] IN FOUR GAMES IN HISTORY.
[ct=3701.450] KIRK: INCREDIBLE AFTER THEIR
[ct=3703.116] FIRST TWO WEEKS HAD THE ONE SACK
[ct=3703.977] AND OUT -- ANSWERED A LOT OF
[ct=3706.076] QUESTIONS FROM THEIR
[ct=3707.366] MEDIA.
[ct=3707.740] WHY CAN'T YOU COME UP WITH THE
[ct=3708.067] SACK?
[ct=3711.776] AL: NIXON.
[ct=3714.419] INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=3717.036] THE FLAG IS THROWN.
[ct=3718.420] A GOOD RUNBACK.
[ct=3719.750] YOU KNOW WHAT THAT NORMALLY
[ct=3722.453] MEANS.
[ct=3725.120] ALL THE LINES ARE POINTING IN A
[ct=3725.120] WESTERLY DIRECTION.
[ct=3730.433] HOBBLES OFF.
[ct=3734.765] NUMBER 89.
[ct=3737.265] 10 YARD PENALTY.
[ct=3741.629] AL: MOMENTS AGO, KAYLEE TALKED
[ct=3742.950] TO MATT LAFLEUR.
[ct=3745.272] KAYLEE: WHAT ADJUSTMENTS DO YOU
[ct=3745.970] NEED TO PUT
[ct=3747.603] YOUR LOVE?
[ct=3749.204] >> WE HAVE TO BLOCK BETTER.
[ct=3752.494] THEY WON THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE
[ct=3753.214] ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BALL.
[ct=3755.833] IT'S VERY HUMBLING AND
[ct=3756.137] EMBARRASSING.
[ct=3757.742] KAYLEE: WHAT DID YOU TELL YOUR
[ct=3758.600] TEAM AT THE HALF?
[ct=3760.603] >> WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO LOOK
[ct=3762.835] EACH OTHER INTO THE EYE AND GIVE
[ct=3764.933] IT UP FOR ONE ANOTHER THIS WHOLE
[ct=3765.283] SECOND HALF.
[ct=3765.655] I WANT TO SEE THE TEAM FIGHT.
[ct=3771.931] AL: NOT MUCH MORE NEED BE SAID.
[ct=3775.176] FROM THE 14 YARD LINE.
[ct=3781.880] PRESSURE ON.
[ct=3784.214] THE PASS IS CAUGHT AND TAKEN
[ct=3785.959] DOWN TO THE 20 YARD LINE.
[ct=3788.290] THERE'S TUCKER CRAFT.
[ct=3788.647] NUMBER TWO TIGHT END.
[ct=3791.820] KIRK: THREE ROOKIE TIGHT ENDS.
[ct=3794.586] YOU CAN FEEL THAT ENERGY TO GET
[ct=3796.889] YOU CAN'T BLAME MATT LEFLORE
[ct=3798.226] EMBARRASSED AND FRUSTRATED,
[ct=3798.903] TRYING TO COME UP WITH ANSWERS.
[ct=3802.245] WE TALKED ABOUT, WHAT DO YOU DO
[ct=3803.798] WHEN YOU ARE LOSING THE LINE OF
[ct=3804.158] SCRIMMAGE AS BADLY ON OFFENSE?
[ct=3806.965] ONE OF THE THINGS RIGHT THERE,
[ct=3808.232] MOVING THE LAUNCH POINT.
[ct=3809.014] MOVING THE POCKET AROUND.
[ct=3811.531] TRYING TO GIVE YOUR QUARTERBACK
[ct=3812.172] A CHANCE TO GET AWAY FROM THE
[ct=3812.626] PRESSURE.
[ct=3815.173] AL: ON THE GROUND.
[ct=3818.706] COMES A YARD SHINE.
[ct=3820.326] AARON JONES WORKING HIS WAY BACK
[ct=3821.131] FROM A HAMSTRING INJURY.
[ct=3823.334] NEVER A GOOD SIGN WHEN A COACH
[ct=3826.941] REFERS TO, IT'S EMBARRASSING.
[ct=3827.577] SEAN PAYTON MAY HAVE SAID THAT
[ct=3828.065] LAST WEEK IN MIAMI.
[ct=3831.800] KIRK: THAT WAS REALLY A ROUGH
[ct=3833.825] AFTERNOON FOR DENVER.
[ct=3836.735] THIS FIRST HALF, WE WERE ALL
[ct=3839.305] TALKING AT HALFTIME, WHEN WAS
[ct=3839.644] THE LAST TIME THIS CROWD DEALT
[ct=3840.486] WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS?
[ct=3841.824] EVER?
[ct=3844.863] PRE-BRETT FAVRE?
[ct=3847.840] AL: MAYBE IN THE LATE 80'S.
[ct=3851.903] THIRD AND 1.
[ct=3855.664] THAT'S GOING TO BE CAUGHT FOR A
[ct=3861.091] DOBBS.
[ct=3861.766] GREEN BAY'S FOURTH FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3864.579] CREATES AN UPROARIOUS SITUATION
[ct=3865.539] IN THE STANDS.
[ct=3868.527] KAYLEE: DAN CAMPBELL TOLD ME HIS
[ct=3869.350] BIGGEST CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS
[ct=3872.357] THAT HIS TEAM WON'T COME OUT
[ct=3872.699] WITH THE SAME ENERGY THAT GOT
[ct=3873.465] THEM THIS 24 POINT LEAD.
[ct=3875.980] HE TOLD ME, I SAW THAT PACKERS
[ct=3877.955] GAME LAST WEEK, I SAW THEM COME
[ct=3879.957] BACK, WE CAN'T LET THEM DO THAT
[ct=3880.283] RIGHT NOW.
[ct=3883.192] HE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE ANY
[ct=3883.698] PENALTIES FROM HIS TEAM.
[ct=3886.063] HE WANTS TO SEE MORE DISCIPLINE.
[ct=3891.054] AL: THAT'S CAUGHT WIDE OPEN.
[ct=3891.346] LAUNCHING.
[ct=3895.226] FINALLY A BIG PLAY FROM THE
[ct=3897.991] 25 YARDS.
[ct=3900.653] KIRK: THEY ARE PLAYING WITH TWO
[ct=3902.368] SAFETIES DEEP.
[ct=3903.723] YOU SEE MOVEMENT HERE AND HERE.
[ct=3905.549] DOBBS DOES A GOOD JOB OF
[ct=3908.700] CLEARING IT OUT, OPENING UP A
[ct=3910.643] NICE THROWING LANE THERE.
[ct=3912.641] YOU SAW THE PRESSURE BY MCNEIL.
[ct=3914.016] GOOD JOB OF WAITING UNTIL THE
[ct=3915.594] LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT UNTIL HE
[ct=3918.417] GOT RID OF THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=3919.918] CLEARED OVER THE MIDDLE THERE.
[ct=3920.205] NICE GAME.
[ct=3930.461] AL: MOTION HERE.
[ct=3932.066] NOTHING.
[ct=3937.105] FLAG THROWN.
[ct=3944.022] TO JONES.
[ct=3944.306] HE MADE THE CATCH.
[ct=3952.055] THAT WOULD'VE BEEN A TWO YARD
[ct=3956.205] >> HANDS TO THE FACE.
[ct=3956.539] NUMBER 97.
[ct=3961.902] AL: THERE'S HUTCHERSON.
[ct=3964.844] KIRK: RIGHT NEAR THE END OF HIS
[ct=3967.076] MOVE FOR THE CORNERBACK.
[ct=3967.786] HE GOT HIS HANDS INTO THE FACE
[ct=3968.156] OF SACK TOM.
[ct=3973.082] REMEMBER, HE'S A GUY THAT'S
[ct=3974.193] GOING TO GO BEYOND THE WHISTLE.
[ct=3980.512] HE WAS REALLY CLOSE.
[ct=3982.653] I DON'T THINK HE CARED FOR THAT
[ct=3983.075] AT ALL.
[ct=3985.857] IT LOOKED LIKE HE GOT THE TOP OF
[ct=3986.363] THE SHOULDER PAD.
[ct=3989.731] THE REFEREE SAW IT AND THROUGH
[ct=3993.619] THE FLAG -- THREW THE FLAG.
[ct=4000.246] AL: HE GOES INTO THE PATTERN.
[ct=4005.228] THE PAST IS THROWN OUT OF BOUNDS
[ct=4008.293] -- PASS IS THROWN OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=4011.587] DOBBS THE INTENDED RECEIVER.
[ct=4016.253] KIRK: HE IS TRYING TO KEEP HIS
[ct=4016.922] SAFETY IS BACK.
[ct=4020.066] HE DOES NOT WANT TO GIVE UP THE
[ct=4020.066] HOMERUN.
[ct=4025.889] HAVE A SAFETIES BACK THERE AND
[ct=4026.276] MAKE GREEN BAY HAVE TO RUN THE
[ct=4029.740] FOOTBALL OR MAKE SHORT OR
[ct=4030.062] INTERMEDIATE THROWS.
[ct=4036.548] AL: HE PLAYED FOR BILL BELICHICK
[ct=4036.815] AND BILL PARCELLS.
[ct=4044.592] HE HAS NOT HIT THE HOMERUN YET.
[ct=4051.891] HE TOOK SOME PEOPLE ON THE
[ct=4052.711] SIDELINE WITH HIM.
[ct=4055.660] A FLAG DOWN.
[ct=4066.249] WOULD'VE BEEN A NINE YEARD GAIN.
[ct=4069.006] BRANCH NEEDS ATTENTION.
[ct=4072.256] >> PERSONAL FOUL, UNNECESSARY
[ct=4073.467] ROUGHNESS.
[ct=4083.519] KIRK: HE USES HIS HELMET.
[ct=4086.649] HE LOWERS HIS HELMET, IS THE
[ct=4087.495] CALL.
[ct=4089.962] HE IS IN BOUNDS.
[ct=4091.948] CAN YOU BRING IN ON THIS?
[ct=4096.083] >> THAT IS THE ONLY THING THEY
[ct=4096.528] CAN CALL IS USE OF THE HELMET.
[ct=4098.838] LOWERING HIS HELMET.
[ct=4101.012] IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS LEAVING WITH
[ct=4101.774] HIS SHOULDER.
[ct=4104.183] THE HELMET CONTACT WAS
[ct=4105.224] INCIDENTAL.
[ct=4108.259] I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS A FOUL.
[ct=4110.279] AL: THEY CALLED IT ANYWAY.
[ct=4112.303] BRANCH IS DOWN.
[ct=4113.632] STILL DOWN.
[ct=4116.257] HERE IS HOW HE GOT HURT.
[ct=4123.003] KIRK: AS HE SIMULTANEOUSLY GETS
[ct=4123.676] HIT.
[ct=4126.958] I DON'T KNOW IF HE STEPPED ON
[ct=4126.958] HIS FOOT.
[ct=4129.854] HE IMMEDIATELY WENT DOWN.
[ct=4142.278] IF YOU ARE LIONS FANS, YOU'RE
[ct=4142.720] HOLDING YOUR BREATH.
[ct=4146.141] THIS ROOKIE HAS BEEN A GREAT
[ct=4146.537] PICKUP FOR DETROIT.
[ct=4149.851] SO VERSATILE AND SO TOUGH.
[ct=4158.793] HE TOOK IT ALL THE WAY IN.
[ct=4164.685] NOT A GOOD SIGN AS HE COMES
[ct=4164.983] HOBBLING OFF THE FIELD.
[ct=4170.339] SECOND ROUND PICK OUT OF
[ct=4175.664] KIRK: LET’

[ct=4177.526] HAPPENS BEFORE THE CONTACT.
[ct=4182.894] YOU SEE HIM REACHING DOWN TO
[ct=4183.345] THAT RIGHT LEG.
[ct=4188.058] AL: THE ROOKIE GOES TO THE
[ct=4188.460] BENCH.
[ct=4194.475] PENALTIES HAVE HELPED AS WELL.
[ct=4199.907] THE THROW IS JUGGLED AND CAUGHT
[ct=4199.907] BUT NOTHING DOING THERE.
[ct=4212.134] KIRK: CHANGING HIS ARM ANGLE TO
[ct=4212.987] GET AROUND THE PRESSURE.
[ct=4219.079] DETROIT ALREADY, JOHNSON HAS
[ct=4219.418] BEEN OUT.

[ct=4250.562] AGAINST THIS PAST CRUSH.
[ct=4256.813] -- RUSH.
[ct=4262.188] USUALLY HE IS GETTING IN THERE
[ct=4271.424] THE ONLY THING WALKER COULD DO
[ct=4274.143] IS GRAB ONTO HIM.
[ct=4278.547] AL: HE HAS MISSED SO MANY GAMES
[ct=4279.011] THROUGHOUT THE LAST COUPLE OF
[ct=4279.011] SEASONS.

[ct=4296.687] TO THE SIXTEEN YARD LINE.
[ct=4301.364] THERE GOES BRANCH.
[ct=4305.433] THAT IS A BAD SITE.
[ct=4308.265] TO THE LOCKER ROOM HE GOES.
[ct=4310.204] KIRK: YOU HATE TO SEE THAT.
[ct=4312.740] HOPEFULLY HE WILL BE OK.
[ct=4315.339] THEY WILL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT
[ct=4316.973] THAT WITH AN X-RAY.
[ct=4320.349] THEY HAVE A NICE DRIVE.
[ct=4321.143] THEY HAVE TO CONVERT.
[ct=4323.510] AL: FORGET A FIELD GOAL.
[ct=4328.681] THEY NEED TO SEVEN.
[ct=4330.722] CAN THEY GET IT?
[ct=4337.715] LOVE FIRES, CAUGHT BY DOBBS TO
[ct=4340.675] MAKE IT FIRST AND GOAL.
[ct=4343.319] KIRK: BROUGHT THE PRESSURE.
[ct=4346.403] A GOOD JOB OF SITTING IN THEIR.
[ct=4348.965] MAKING A HECK OF A THROW.
[ct=4351.681] PUTTING THE SAFETY IN A TOUGH
[ct=4352.009] SPOT.
[ct=4354.626] WATCH HIM JUMP THE ROUTE
[ct=4355.317] UNDERNEATH.
[ct=4357.471] HE HAS A GREAT OPENING RIGHT
[ct=4359.146] BEHIND TO MAKE THE THROW.
[ct=4364.508] AL: 15 YARDS.
[ct=4375.411] SECOND DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=4377.057] KIRK: GOOD DRIVE HERE.
[ct=4380.807] THE FIRST HALF, 20 YARDS.
[ct=4383.431] THIS DRIVE, 85 YARDS.
[ct=4386.383] AL: 11 PLAYS.
[ct=4389.342] STARTED WITH A PENALTY.
[ct=4392.608] NOW YOU HAVE AN INJURED LION.
[ct=4398.748] KIRK: WE HAVE HAD BRANCH GO
[ct=4400.768] DOWN, NOW BARNES.
[ct=4413.123] AL: BARNES ABLE TO WALK OFF
[ct=4413.833] UNDER HIS OWN POWER.
[ct=4417.322] SECOND AND GOAL.
[ct=4422.363] 8:30 TO GO IN THE THIRD.
[ct=4424.430] TRYING TO CULMINATE WHAT WOULD
[ct=4427.733] BE AN 86 YARD DRIVE.
[ct=4433.029] IN THE PISTOL.
[ct=4433.029] NOW SIDE-BY-SIDE.
[ct=4438.349] PLAY FAKE, PASS, WIDE-OPEN,
[ct=4439.996] TOUCHDOWN WATSON.
[ct=4450.433] 27-9.
[ct=4454.414] THEY WILL KEEP THE OFFENSE OUT
[ct=4456.003] THERE TO MAKE IT A TWO
[ct=4456.488] POSSESSION GAME.
[ct=4461.037] MAKE IT 27-11.
[ct=4464.781] KIRK: A LITTLE MISCOMMUNICATION
[ct=4466.732] THERE FROM THE FOUR -- DETROIT
[ct=4466.732] DEFENDERS.
[ct=4469.653] MADE IT PRETTY EASY.
[ct=4480.240] AL: TWO POINT CONVERSION.
[ct=4483.489] THEY CONVERTED ONE LAST WEEK.
[ct=4492.776] THAT PASS CAUGHT IN THE BACK OF
[ct=4505.283] THEY WERE DOWN HUGE OPENING
[ct=4505.690] NIGHT BACK IN 2018.
[ct=4509.936] KIRK: THEY ARE BELIEVING.
[ct=4512.666] NOW IT IS UP TO THE DEFENSE.
[ct=4514.001] NOBODY THERE.
[ct=4517.465] YOU CAN SEE WALKER COMPLETELY
[ct=4518.900] FOOLED.
[ct=4521.531] HE KIND OF GOT CAUGHT UP WITH
[ct=4523.553] THE QUARTERBACK ROLLING THAT
[ct=4523.553] WAY.
[ct=4526.457] A GOOD CALL BY MATT LAFLEUR.
[ct=4534.426] YOU KNOW HE CHALLENGED THEM JUST
[ct=4534.426] BASED ON THAT.
[ct=4536.966] THEY WERE FRUSTRATED AND
[ct=4537.318] EMBARRASSED.
[ct=4540.012] HE WANTS TO SEE WHO WANTS TO
[ct=4542.834] FIGHT IN THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=4546.947] KAYLEE: JUST AFTER WE SAW HIM
[ct=4549.430] CARTED OFF THE FIELD, HE WAS
[ct=4549.842] TAKEN STRAIGHT TO THE X-RAY
[ct=4549.842] ROOM.
[ct=4553.548] THERE WILL -- THE LIONS TOLD US
[ct=4554.463] HE IS QUESTIONABLE TO RETURN.
[ct=4557.852] THE PACKERS ARE RULING OUT THERE
[ct=4561.778] TIGHT END AFTER HE WAS EVALUATED
[ct=4562.480] IN CONCUSSION PROTOCOL.
[ct=4565.115] AL: A GUY GOES OFF ON A CART.
[ct=4568.084] I DID THE OPENING GAME HERE.
[ct=4571.861] THE BEARS LED 20-0.
[ct=4576.242] AARON RODGERS TAKE IT OUT ON A
[ct=4576.669] CART.
[ct=4580.483] SECOND HALF, BACK HE COMES.
[ct=4580.849] THREE TOUCHDOWN PASSES.
[ct=4582.123] THEY WIN THE GAME.
[ct=4584.574] OURTH
[ct=4587.157] RATING.
[ct=4589.831] KIRK: HE MADE A MISTAKE EARLY
[ct=4590.176] WITH THAT INTERCEPTION.
[ct=4592.782] SINCE THEN HE HAS PRETTY MUCH
[ct=4593.085] BEEN IN COMMAND.
[ct=4596.630] HE HAS BEEN EIGHT BENEFICIARY OF
[ct=4597.906] REALLY GOOD OFFENSIVE LINE PLAY.
[ct=4603.007] AL: FROM THE 27.

[ct=4617.922] GREEN BAY.
[ct=4619.305] LET’
[ct=4620.010] LET'S SEE HOW THE DEFENSE CAN
[ct=4620.010] RESPOND.
[ct=4622.553] THEY WILL HAVE TO TAKE SOME
[ct=4622.553] CHANCES.
[ct=4624.980] GET SOME SAFETIES DOWN AGAINST
[ct=4626.943] THIS RUNNING GAME.
[ct=4630.195] BE CAREFUL AGAINST A
[ct=4640.619] AL: PRESSURE FROM THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=4642.554] PASS CAUGHT.
[ct=4645.697] BUT THE TACKLING IS RIGHT THERE.

[ct=4684.735] A QUICK THREE AND OUT.
[ct=4688.032] BUTLER IS RIGHT THERE TO TAKE
[ct=4689.984] SAINT BROWN TO THE GROUND.
[ct=4694.220] LOVE PUTS THE HELMET ON AND HE
[ct=4695.205] IS READY TO COME BACK FOR THE
[ct=4696.221] NEXT DRIVE.
[ct=4698.167] KIRK: THE DEFENSE DOES THEIR
[ct=4700.240] JOB, GETS A THREE AND OUT.
[ct=4704.666] DO NOT THINK THESE GREEN BAY
[ct=4705.429] PACKERS ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT
[ct=4706.357] WHAT THEY DID IN THE FOURTH
[ct=4709.402] ORDER LAST WEEK COMING BACK FROM
[ct=4710.835] 17.
[ct=4716.126] AL: A FAIR CATCH MADE.
[ct=4718.418] 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=4721.875] 6:16 TO GO IN THE THIRD.
[ct=4724.840] THE MIRACLE OF MODERN MEDICINE,
[ct=4725.553] NOW HE IS BACK OUT ON THE
[ct=4725.966] SIDELINE.
[ct=4727.738] THEY ARE TAPING HIM UP.
[ct=4729.647] WHO KNOWS?
[ct=4734.717] GREEN BAY FROM THE 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=4739.065] THAT GOES OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=4742.871] WALKER CAME FLYING IN.
[ct=4747.061] BACKWARD PASS.
[ct=4749.736] KIRK: DEFINITELY A BACKWARDS
[ct=4749.736] PASS.
[ct=4754.115] TRYING TO THROW IT TO DOBBS BUT
[ct=4755.394] DETROIT ALL OVER THAT.
[ct=4758.058] YOU WONDER IF HE IS THINKING
[ct=4760.286] ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF DOBBS
[ct=4762.328] THROWING IT BACK.
[ct=4766.092] LOVE WAS LUCKY TO GET THE BALL
[ct=4766.995] OFF BECAUSE OF WALKER IN HIS
[ct=4768.165] FACE.
[ct=4771.152] AL: THEY TRIED THAT TRICK PLAY
[ct=4771.791] LAST WEEK AND IT DID NOT WORK.
[ct=4776.748] A LOSS OF ELEVEN YARDS.
[ct=4783.409] HERE HE COMES.
[ct=4786.459] THE PASS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=4790.173] WALKER COVERING.
[ct=4794.186] KAYLEE: AS YOU SAW, BRANCHES OUT
[ct=4794.186] HERE ON THE TRAINING TABLE.
[ct=4798.219] THEY PUT AN ADHESIVE HEATING PAD
[ct=4799.878] RIGHT ON THE ANKLE AND GAVE HIM
[ct=4800.963] A SOLID TAPE JOB.
[ct=4803.421] HE DOES NOT LOOK TO BE IN ANY
[ct=4803.421] PAIN.
[ct=4805.858] WHEN HE CAME OUT OF THE TUNNEL,
[ct=4807.046] HE WAS WALKING ON HIS OWN
[ct=4807.451] ACCORD.
[ct=4810.267] HE GOT UP TO A SLOW JOG.
[ct=4813.426] LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE TRYING TO DO
[ct=4813.837] EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO SUPPORT
[ct=4821.206] AL: THIRD AND 21.
[ct=4829.009] DEEP DROP, PASS ALONG THE
[ct=4834.990] OFFICIALS CHECKING WITH EACH
[ct=4835.417] OTHER.
[ct=4838.113] ATTACHED IS GOOD -- CATCH IS
[ct=4839.179] GOOD.
[ct=4842.505] IT WILL BE FOURTH AND 6.
[ct=4846.576] THEY NEEDED 21 GOT 15.
[ct=4850.658] KIRK: DOING HIS BEST MYLES
[ct=4850.658] GARRETT IMPRESSION.
[ct=4854.721] ONE OF THE BETTER JOBS THIS
[ct=4854.721] OFFENSIVE LINE HAS DONE ALL
[ct=4855.676] NIGHT ON A THIRD DOWN.
[ct=4858.952] TOO MANY YARDS TO MAKE OF AFTER
[ct=4858.952] THE LOSS.
[ct=4861.902] AL: THAT BACKWARD PASS KILLED
[ct=4864.598] THE FIFTH PUNT OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=4869.869] FIELDED AT THE 15 YARD LINE.
[ct=4876.899] A COUPLE OF THEM, IN FACT, ON
[ct=4877.181] EITHER SIDE OF THE FIELD.
[ct=4883.591] 4:53 LEFT IN THE THIRD.
[ct=4890.862] KIRK: I THINK EVERYONE IS
[ct=4891.327] GETTING IN LINE.
[ct=4892.924] HE IS.
[ct=4894.363] [LAUGHTER]
[ct=4906.241] LEAN AND MEAN OUT THERE.
[ct=4909.094] AL: I AM TELLING YOU.
[ct=4915.218] A COUPLE OF FLAGS HERE.
[ct=4917.361] SEPARATE FILES.
[ct=4922.454] 22, RECEIVING TEAM.
[ct=4925.037] 10 YARD PENALTY FROM THE SPOT OF
[ct=4926.467] THE FILE.
[ct=4930.550] --DETROIT NOW HAS THE BALL AT
[ct=4933.921] THEIR OWN 11 YARD LINE.
[ct=4941.768] TO THE 14.
[ct=4943.954] KIRK: ONE OF THE THINGS
[ct=4948.331] IMPRESSIVE WITH DETROIT, THEY
[ct=4949.723] HAVE MOVED HIM OVER TO THE RIGHT
[ct=4949.723] SIDE.
[ct=4953.708] I WAS TALKING TO HIS COACH
[ct=4953.708] BEFORE THE GAME.
[ct=4956.716] HE SAID PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND
[ct=4958.665] HOW CHALLENGING THAT IS.
[ct=4961.919] IT IS LIKE TRYING TO MAKE A
[ct=4963.592] LEFT-HANDED LAYUP IN BASKETBALL.
[ct=4967.919] IT IS THE COMPLETE REVERSE OF
[ct=4968.297] WHAT YOU'RE USED TO DOING ON THE
[ct=4973.450] NOW HE IS BACK IN HIS FAMILIAR
[ct=4977.461] AL: FORMER NUMBER ONE PICK OUT
[ct=4977.919] OF OREGON.
[ct=4982.057] COMING UP A LITTLE SHORT IS
[ct=4986.152] THIRD AND 2.
[ct=4992.762] KIRK: THEY HAVE THEIR UNIFORMS
[ct=4993.054] ON.
[ct=5002.109] YOU USUALLY WANT TO HEAR A
[ct=5002.402] QUARTERBACK OR A RECEIVER.
[ct=5005.683] BUT THE LIONS HAVE DONE IT WITH
[ct=5009.366] THREE FIRST ROUNDERS ON THEIR
[ct=5011.020] ONE OF THE REASONS THEY ARE ONE
[ct=5012.414] OF THE TOP OFFENSIVE LINES IN
[ct=5017.751] AL: THEY DO PICK UP THE FIRST
[ct=5019.324] ONLY NEEDED A COUPLE.
[ct=5024.746] GIBBS MAKING THE CATCH
[ct=5026.146] THE SIDELINE, MOVING THE STICKS.
[ct=5028.742] KIRK: THEY MOVED HIM IN MOTION.
[ct=5033.077] BECAUSE THE CORNER DOES
[ct=5034.455] WITH HIM, THEY KNOW IT WILL BE A
[ct=5036.036] LITTLE SOFTER AND COVERAGE.
[ct=5040.168] THE LINEBACKER HAS A LONG WAY TO
[ct=5040.168] GO.
[ct=5044.144] GOOD RECOGNITION BY GOLF --
[ct=5056.139] AL: MONTGOMERY.
[ct=5057.575] CHEWING UP GROUND YARDAGE.
[ct=5061.628] PLENTY OF TIME LEFT BUT YOU
[ct=5063.132] MIGHT AS WELL TAKE AS MUCH TIME
[ct=5064.000] OFF THE CLOCK AS YOU CAN.
[ct=5068.450] KIRK: THAT IS A GREAT POINT.
[ct=5070.457] BCA TALENTED LINES TEAM WITH DAN
[ct=5072.082] CAMPBELL -- WE SEE A TALN
[ct=5072.854] CAMPBELL -- WE SEE A TALENTED
[ct=5077.586] LIONS TEAM WITH DAN CAMPBELL.
[ct=5080.819] THEY NEED TO CLOSE OUT GAMES.
[ct=5093.077] SACK.
[ct=5094.629] BROOKS.
[ct=5131.342] COULD DO BUT TRY TO
[ct=5132.225] THROW THAT AWAY.
[ct=5134.367] AL: THEY RUN A DRAW HERE.
[ct=5139.058] TO THE 26 YARD LINE.
[ct=5141.758] GREEN BAY READY TO GET THE BALL
[ct=5142.900] BACK.
[ct=5147.322] KIRK: THERE TOP TWO CORNERS ARE
[ct=5147.667] OUT OF THIS DEFENSE FOR GREEN
[ct=5151.361] STOKES NOT PLAYING.
[ct=5154.094] ALEXANDER. ABLE TO GO.
[ct=5155.019] TRYING TO HOLD UP WITH SOME
[ct=5157.092] BACKUP CORNERS.
[ct=5169.560] AL: FOX IS NUMBER ONE IN THE
[ct=5170.007] LEAGUE AND PUNTING SINCE HE CAME
[ct=5170.490] INTO THE LEAGUE.
[ct=5173.345] THIS IS A SHORT ONE.
[ct=5176.470] IT WILL ROLL DEAD.
[ct=5179.030] A SHORT KICK.
[ct=5183.360] WE ARE IN THE FINAL MINUTE OF
[ct=5184.105] THE THIRD QUARTER.
[ct=5188.822] WE ARE COMING DOWN TO THE END OF
[ct=5197.852] KIRK: DETROIT IN THE FIRST HALF
[ct=5198.242] WERE THE OPPOSITE.
[ct=5200.921] IN THE THIRD QUARTER, THEY ONLY
[ct=5203.529] HAVE 17 YARDS.
[ct=5207.522] AL: HACKERS TRYING TO BUILD ON
[ct=5209.989] THAT LONG DRIVE -- PACKERS
[ct=5212.566] TRYING TO BUILD ON THAT LONG
[ct=5214.920] DRIVE WITH 16 MINUTES LEFT IN
[ct=5214.920] THE GAME.
[ct=5218.885] JONES IS TAKEN DOWN.
[ct=5221.610] IT IS THAT TIME OF THE MONTH.
[ct=5225.875] YOU SEE UP IN THE SKY.
[ct=5231.233] WHAT THEY CALL THE HARVEST MOON.
[ct=5233.827] BIG, BRIGHT HARVEST MEN.
[ct=5239.889] EVERY TIME I SEE THAT I THINK
[ct=5241.301] ABOUT OUR OLD BUDDY KEITH
[ct=5249.277] SECOND AND 7.
[ct=5253.485] 37 YARD LINE.
[ct=5257.560] KIRK: GOOD JOB OF GETTING THE
[ct=5258.839] BALL OUT OF HIS HANDS.
[ct=5260.794] MOVING THE POCKET.
[ct=5263.757] BALL OUT QUICKLY.
[ct=5266.450] AL: TRYING TO GO QUICKLY HERE
[ct=5267.132] BUT THEY WILL RUN OUT OF TIME.
[ct=5272.067] THEY SAY THE CLOCK DID NOT GO TO
[ct=5272.067] ZEROS.
[ct=5274.113] A BOMB.
[ct=5282.389] TO THE 4 YARD LINE.
[ct=5285.541] RULED A TEST.
[ct=5287.436] 45 YARDS.
[ct=5289.555] THE CLOCK WAS AT TRIPLE ZERO.
[ct=5293.755] THE SNAP WAS GOOD, THE PASS WAS
[ct=5294.316] GREAT.
[ct=5297.233] GREEN BAY IN BUSINESS TO START
[ct=5297.233] THE FOURTH QUARTER.
[ct=5298.648] 27-11
[ct=5303.169] AL: FIRST DOWN AND GOAL FOR
[ct=5307.605] WE WILL SHOW YOU THE PLAY AT THE
[ct=5309.759] END OF THE THIRD QUARTER.

[ct=5319.021] FIRST AND GOAL AFTER A 44 YARD
[ct=5320.107] RECEPTION.

[ct=5428.733] LOVE WILL KEEP IT.
[ct=5430.518] HE IS SHORT.
[ct=5435.670] JOHN COMINSKY SAVES IT.
[ct=5437.776] KEEP SAID A TWO POSSESSION GAME.
[ct=5444.580] MEANWHILE, AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT
[ct=5444.580] LOVE.
[ct=5447.737] KIRK: I THOUGHT HE HAD THE
[ct=5447.737] CORNER.
[ct=5450.756] HIS KNEE IS DOWN.
[ct=5453.716] A HECKUVA JOB FIGHTING THROUGH
[ct=5454.592] TO MAKE THE PLAY.
[ct=5456.649] AL: PRETTY CLEAR.
[ct=5463.228] KNEE GOES FIRST.
[ct=5464.676] HE IS DOWN.
[ct=5467.619] PRETTY CLEARLY.
[ct=5471.221] WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE END OF
[ct=5473.375] WE HAVE TO BRING YOU IN.
[ct=5476.296] WATCH THE CLOCK.
[ct=5481.953] AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER.
[ct=5486.426] >> THE CLOCK CLEARLY HAD ZERO
[ct=5486.708] BEFORE THE BALL WAS SNAPPED.
[ct=5496.162] ONCE AGAIN CLOCK HIT ZERO, IT
[ct=5497.389] SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN ON THE FIELD
[ct=5497.389] BY THE OFFICIALS.
[ct=5500.530] NOT A REVIEWABLE PLAY.
[ct=5505.384] AL: THAT IS SUCH A GREAT POINT.
[ct=5507.469] A LOT OF TIMES YOU WILL SEE THE
[ct=5510.559] PLAY CLOCK GO TO ZERO BUT THE
[ct=5510.874] OFFICIAL DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.
[ct=5513.825] YOU ARE SO RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
[ct=5519.124] NO WIGGLE ROOM.
[ct=5521.766] KIRK: THEY GOT AWAY WITH IT AND
[ct=5522.544] THEY CAPITALIZE.
[ct=5525.687] A RARE ONE-ON-ONE OPPORTUNITY
[ct=5527.000] AND IT IS A PERFECT THROW AND A
[ct=5527.926] GREAT CATCH.
[ct=5532.485] COMPARED TO WHAT THEY FACED LAST
[ct=5533.143] WEEK IN THE THIRD QUARTER, THIS
[ct=5534.047] IS NO PROBLEM.
[ct=5535.778] A DIFFERENT TEAM.
[ct=5543.383] AL: AT LEAST THEY MADE A GAME
[ct=5543.879] OUT OF IT.
[ct=5545.268] THIS PLACE WAS DEAD.
[ct=5547.711] KIRK: IT IS A LONG WAY TO GO.
[ct=5552.903] THIS GAME WAS OVER, 27-3.
[ct=5554.750] AL: THAT IS TODAY'S NFL.
[ct=5558.443] IT IS A CLICHE TO SAY NO LEAD IS
[ct=5559.402] SAFE.
[ct=5562.558] WE ARE GETTING CLOSE.
[ct=5563.982] KIRK: WE KEEP GETTING CAUGHT UP
[ct=5564.657] IN THE OFFENSE.
[ct=5568.173] BUT IT HAS BEEN THE DEFENSE THE
[ct=5570.198] LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS THAT HAVE
[ct=5572.129] GIVEN THE PACKERS A CHANCE TO
[ct=5574.371] GET THERE OFFENSE BACK OUT THERE
[ct=5575.225] AND GET THEM INTO THE GAME.
[ct=5582.383] AL: A LITTLE FLIP OUT IN THE
[ct=5582.383] FLAT.
[ct=5587.074] MONTGOMERY TAKES IT FOR A GAIN.
[ct=5590.393] SECOND DOWN AND SHORT.
[ct=5592.584] KIRK: JOHNSON IS THE PLAY
[ct=5592.887] CALLER.
[ct=5595.963] WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT HIM AS ONE
[ct=5597.793] OF THE ELITE PLAY CALLERS IN THE
[ct=5598.221] LEAGUE.
[ct=5601.498] 27-3 ON THE ROAD.
[ct=5604.832] YOU START TO WORK THE CLOCK AND
[ct=5606.183] BE SMART ABOUT NOT MAKING AN
[ct=5606.183] ERROR.
[ct=5609.332] NOW YOU GO BACK TO THE FIRST
[ct=5610.715] HALF MODE OF BEING AGGRESSIVE.
[ct=5613.162] TRYING TO PUT POINTS UP ON THE
[ct=5613.675] BOARD.
[ct=5620.957] AL: GIBBS ON A DRAW.
[ct=5623.724] WALKER MAKING THE TACKLE.
[ct=5626.426] KIRK: THIS OFFENSIVE LINE
[ct=5628.261] DOMINATED THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=5632.319] IN ORDER FOR THAT NOT TO HAPPEN
[ct=5633.873] AGAIN IN THE SECOND HALF, THE
[ct=5634.290] PACKERS HAVE BEEN BLITZING.
[ct=5636.037] ATTACKING THE RUN.
[ct=5637.909] SAFETIES COMING DOWN.
[ct=5640.858] WHEN YOU ROLL THE DICE LIKE THAT
[ct=5641.932] AS A DEFENSE, IT CREATES
[ct=5646.359] OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE RECEIVERS
[ct=5647.787] ON PLAY-ACTION TO GET SOME ONE
[ct=5649.351] ON ONE SHOT DOWNFIELD.
[ct=5651.481] AL: ALMOST A PERFECT BALANCE FOR
[ct=5653.421] THE LIONS OFFENSE.
[ct=5657.838] 26 RUNS, 25 PASSES.
[ct=5659.327] THIS WILL MAKE IT EVEN.
[ct=5663.622] FIRST DOWN, MONTGOMERY.
[ct=5666.937] HE PICKS UP ABOUT 13.
[ct=5676.484] KIRK: YOU LOVE TO SEE THE
[ct=5676.484] PATIENTS.
[ct=5678.421] RINSE AND REPEAT.
[ct=5682.501] OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
[ct=5687.933] YOU LOVE THE PLAY ACTION.
[ct=5703.041] INTO GREEN BAY TERRITORY.
[ct=5710.264] KIRK: PERFECT TECHNIQUE.
[ct=5712.826] LOOK AT THE DOUBLE-TEAMED.
[ct=5716.931] HE GETS UP RIGHT THERE.
[ct=5719.440] THAT IS TEXTBOOK.
[ct=5723.751] YOU SEE MONTGOMERY STARTING TO
[ct=5724.410] WEAR ON THE DEFENSE.
[ct=5736.268] AL: GIBBS GETS A TURN.
[ct=5736.268] HE HAS IT.
[ct=5738.667] THIRD DOWN AND 2.
[ct=5746.500] VAN NESS, A ROOKIE FROM IOWA,
[ct=5748.083] MAKES THE STOP.
[ct=5750.079] HE WAS THERE NUMBER ONE PICK.
[ct=5758.705] BIG THIRD AND 2 FOR THE PACKER
[ct=5778.126] GIBBS GOT IT.
[ct=5781.127] TO THE 39 YARD LINE.
[ct=5787.579] KIRK: IT IS FUN TO WATCH THESE
[ct=5793.719] CLIMBING UP.
[ct=5798.951] JACKSON, IT IS EASY THERE.
[ct=5804.508] PEOPLE WOULD BE SURPRISED.
[ct=5804.787] IF YOU DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT
[ct=5808.419] GIBBS, THE ROOKIE.
[ct=5808.951] HE IS PHYSICAL.
[ct=5814.933] AL: THESE DAYS YOU DON'T SEE A
[ct=5815.316] LOT OF RUNNING BACKS DRAFTED IN
[ct=5816.278] THE FIRST ROUND.
[ct=5820.583] REACHING OUT AND MAKING THE
[ct=5821.683] GRAB, REYNOLDS.
[ct=5828.911] KIRK: I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT
[ct=5832.683] JOHNSON CHANGING HIS MODE.
[ct=5833.088] AGGRESSIVE MINDSET.
[ct=5839.292] ABLE TO TURN HIS BODY.
[ct=5840.838] ANOTHER FIRST AND 10 PLAY ACTION
[ct=5847.311] THE BIG OFFENSIVE LINE, JOHNSON
[ct=5847.941] ONE STEP AHEAD OF THEM.
[ct=5854.817] AL: 10:30 LEFT IN REGULATION.
[ct=5867.673] ANOTHER THING FEID IS -- GOFF IS
[ct=5869.570] REALLY GOOD AT, BALL HANDLING.
[ct=5870.955] KIRK: THAT IS PART OF HIS
[ct=5871.274] MATURATION.
[ct=5876.443] SECOND YEAR IN THIS SCHEME.
[ct=5880.064] WHEN YOU TALK TO HIS COACHES,
[ct=5880.790] THEY SAY HE IS A DIFFERENT GUY
[ct=5882.145] THAN HE WAS.
[ct=5887.765] HE IS UNDER CENTER A LOT WITH
[ct=5888.236] THE RUN GAME.
[ct=5891.670] THE MECHANICS WITH THAT
[ct=5892.572] PLAY-ACTION GAME.
[ct=5895.676] AL: SECOND AND 7.
[ct=5898.408] NOTHING HAPPENING.
[ct=5900.125] GOING NOWHERE.
[ct=5904.303] WALKER IN THE MIX.
[ct=5908.966] KIRK: GOOD PLAY BY THE ROOKIE.
[ct=5912.472] ABLE TO BOUNCE OFF AND GET SOME
[ct=5913.808] PENETRATION.
[ct=5915.616] HIS LITTLE SWIM TECHNIQUE.
[ct=5919.666] THAT IS WHAT HE IS KNOWN FOR
[ct=5919.940] FROM HIS DAYS AT AUBURN.
[ct=5922.919] USING HIS QUICKNESS.
[ct=5925.666] AL: THIRD DOWN AND 9.
[ct=5939.133] THEY KEEP IT ON THE GROUND.
[ct=5943.477] TAKING IT TO THE 11.
[ct=5946.478] A COUPLE OF YARDS SHY.
[ct=5950.960] GIBBS THAT TIME.
[ct=5952.669] GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH THESE
[ct=5955.377] KIRK: THAT AGGRESSIVE MINDSET.
[ct=5959.986] HOPE FOR SOME POSITIVE YARDS.
[ct=5963.121] THEY WANT TO GO WITH IT -- FOR
[ct=5963.907] IT HERE.
[ct=5968.920] AL: TRYING TO MAKE IT 34-17.
[ct=5972.221] A THREE POSSESSIONS SCORE IF YOU
[ct=5972.834] CAN GET INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=5975.244] THEY LINE UP ANYWAY TO GO FOR
[ct=5979.657] TRYING TO DRAW THEM OFFSIDE?
[ct=5982.597] THAT IS ALL THEY WERE DOING.
[ct=5985.379] TRYING TO DRAW THEM OFFSIDE.
[ct=5991.179] KIRK: THAT IS A VICTORY FOR
[ct=5995.759] YOU HAVE TO GET TWO TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=6000.097] BUT THEY COME UP WITH A STOP
[ct=6001.548] RIGHT DOWN THE FIELD.
[ct=6005.222] AL: 17 IS ALMOST SURELY OUT OF
[ct=6005.726] REACH.
[ct=6007.977] 13, YOU HAVE A SHOT.
[ct=6016.206] HE WILL ATTEMPT TO SHORT FIELD
[ct=6016.617] GOAL.
[ct=6024.304] HE HAS MADE A COUPLE TONIGHT.
[ct=6035.690] THIS ONE WILL BE ABOUT 30 YARDS.
[ct=6067.670] >> DURING THE FIELD,
[ct=6069.497] UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT, NUMBER
[ct=6069.869] SEVEN, DEFENSE.
[ct=6076.363] THE PENALTY WILL BE ENFORCED
[ct=6078.395] HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL
[ct=6078.957] FROM THE PREVIOUS SPOT.
[ct=6081.158] AL: THINK ABOUT THAT.
[ct=6082.961] THE FIELD GOAL WOULD'VE MADE IT
[ct=6085.935] 30-17.
[ct=6089.049] ON WALKER.
[ct=6092.177] TALK ABOUT A LATE FLAG.
[ct=6097.729] THE PACKER RETURN TEAM HAD
[ct=6098.012] ALREADY COME OUT AND THE LIONS
[ct=6098.422] KICKOFF
[ct=6100.617] OUT.
[ct=6102.436] KIRK: YOU CAN SEE THE OFFICIALS
[ct=6104.334] COME TOGETHER.
[ct=6106.274] >> IT IS CLEARLY A FOUL.
[ct=6109.763] UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT.
[ct=6113.034] THAT IS WHAT HE DID ON THAT
[ct=6121.054] AL: THEY TAKE THE THREE POINTS
[ct=6122.857] OFF THE BOARD BUT NOW THEY ARE
[ct=6123.913] THINKING ABOUT SEVEN, OBVIOUSLY.
[ct=6129.070] THEY CAN CHEW UP SOME CLOCK
[ct=6130.136] SHOULD THEY PREFER AS WELL.
[ct=6133.122] MONTGOMERY SLIDING TO THE 3.
[ct=6137.617] KIRK: WALKER HAS WORKED SO HARD.
[ct=6140.189] HE HAS TALKED ABOUT MEDITATION,
[ct=6143.467] MATURITY, BEING THE GUY THEY
[ct=6144.066] COUNT ON.
[ct=6144.612] A GUIDE TO MAKE BETTER
[ct=6144.912] DECISIONS.
[ct=6148.142] HE GOT KICKED OUT OF A COUPLE OF
[ct=6148.550] GAMES LAST YEAR.
[ct=6151.152] HE HAS WORKED VERY HARD ON THAT
[ct=6152.083] PART OF HIS GAME.
[ct=6154.403] AL: HE HAS BEEN IN ON A TON OF
[ct=6156.217] TACKLES TONIGHT.
[ct=6158.242] WELL INTO DOUBLE FIGURES.
[ct=6161.833] THAT WAS A KILLER.
[ct=6168.633] UNLESS THEY CAN STOP HIM HERE
[ct=6168.906] AND HOLD THEM TO ANOTHER FIELD
[ct=6175.020] STUFFED IN THE BACKFIELD IS
[ct=6180.472] OFF.
[ct=6182.183] KIRK: THEY ARE DOING WHAT THEY
[ct=6183.647] CAN UPFRONT.
[ct=6186.490] THEY HAVE PLAYED SO WELL.
[ct=6189.411] GETTING PENETRATION AND MAKING
[ct=6190.902] GREAT PLAYS.
[ct=6195.562] NUMBER 95 WAS THERE TO HELP OUT.
[ct=6201.521] AL: THIRD AND GOAL.
[ct=6203.699] ANOTHER HUGE PLAY FOR THE GREEN
[ct=6204.518] BAY DEFENSE.
[ct=6208.702] TRYING TO KEEP IT A TWO
[ct=6209.475] POSSESSION LEAD.
[ct=6217.423] THE BALL IS HANDED OFF AND STOP
[ct=6218.888] AT THE 1 YARD LINE.
[ct=6222.503] KIRK: THEY LINED UP TO GO FOR IT
[ct=6224.388] WHEN IT WAS FOURTH AND 2.
[ct=6228.982] DAN CAMPBELL CALL A TIMEOUT.
[ct=6231.110] NOW WITH THIS OFFENSIVE LINE,
[ct=6232.770] THE WAY YOU SAW MONTGOMERY WORK
[ct=6233.281] IT ALL THE WAY DOWN.
[ct=6239.220] AL: WORST CASE, YOU DON'T GET
[ct=6241.084] IT, GREEN BAY HAS A 99 YARD
[ct=6241.540] FIELD.
[ct=6243.835] KIRK: NOW YOU'RE DOWN TO SIX
[ct=6244.123] MINUTES.
[ct=6247.135] AL: FOURTH AND GOAL.
[ct=6258.155] HANDED OFF AND INTO THE END ZONE
[ct=6259.595] GOES MONTGOMERY.
[ct=6265.462] HE HAS CARRIED THE BALL 26
[ct=6266.673] TIMES.
[ct=6270.059] 84 YARDS TONIGHT.
[ct=6273.425] KIRK: THEY HAD THREE TIGHT ENDS
[ct=6275.266] TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=6275.266] THEY WENT RIGHT BEHIND THE RIGHT
[ct=6279.638] WATCH HIM TURN HIS BODY AWAY
[ct=6282.954] FROM THE HOLE TO OPEN IT UP.
[ct=6287.496] ACTUALLY TAKES WALKER WITH HIM.
[ct=6287.496] THE LINEBACKER.
[ct=6291.463] HE TURNS HIS BODY THE OTHER WAY
[ct=6293.541] AND OPENS THE HOLE
[ct=6296.604] AL: EXTRA POINT OF SOME
[ct=6296.862] SIGNIFICANCE.
[ct=6302.795] IT IS A THREE SCORE GAME.
[ct=6307.027] THE WALKER PENALTY TAKES THE
[ct=6307.404] FIELD GOAL OFF THE BOARD AND
[ct=6308.743] SETS THEM UP FOR SEVEN.
[ct=6311.749] THEY CASH IN HERE.
[ct=6313.843] 34-17.
[ct=6314.378] ILL
[ct=6314.378] SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
[ct=6317.803] CHICAGO AND WASHINGTON NEXT WEEK
[ct=6317.803] ON THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL.
[ct=6321.397] MEANWHILE, THERE IS WALKER BEING
[ct=6322.678] TALKED TO ABOUT THAT LEAPING
[ct=6324.630] FOUL THAT WAS VERY COSTLY.
[ct=6327.839] GREEN BAY DOWN BY 17.
[ct=6329.852] OUT OF THE END ZONE.
[ct=6331.688] I STOP.
[ct=6334.871] -- NICE STOP.
[ct=6337.737] TRIP UP AT THE 15 YARD LINE.
[ct=6342.270] THE PACKERS IN ALL LIKELIHOOD
[ct=6342.594] WILL GO TO 2-2.
[ct=6345.414] THE VIKINGS AND BEARS ARE
[ct=6347.530] WINLESS AT THIS POINT.
[ct=6351.468] KIRK: IT IS BEEN INCREDIBLE THE
[ct=6352.240] SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE
[ct=6353.153] VIKINGS AND BEARS.
[ct=6356.669] THIS IS A BIG WIN FOR THE LIONS.
[ct=6359.393] THEY MOVED TO 3-1.
[ct=6365.423] THEY HAVE HAD ONLY -- SUCCESS IS
[ct=6366.912] VERY NEW TO THEM.
[ct=6367.261] IN THIS CULTURE.
[ct=6372.485] AL: A GOOD PART OF THE CROWD HAS
[ct=6372.780] STAYED FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS.
[ct=6376.854] SOMETIMES IN A BLOWOUT SITUATION
[ct=6381.012] YOU LEAVE EARLY BUT THE CROWD --
[ct=6383.994] THERE ARE EIGHT HOME GAMES AND
[ct=6385.465] THE MILWAUKEE GROUP OR THE
[ct=6386.097] SOUTHERN WISCONSIN GROUP, THIS
[ct=6390.264] IS ONE OF THEIR TWO GAMES AS THE
[ct=6391.527] CATCH IS MADE BY ROMEO DOUBS.
[ct=6399.308] YOU LET THOSE PEOPLE HAVE
[ct=6399.308] PRIORITY FOR TWO GAMES.
[ct=6403.992] AND ANOTHER REASON IS THERE IS A
[ct=6405.501] LOT OF DETROIT FANS HERE AND IT
[ct=6405.501] IS A NICE NIGHT.
[ct=6408.616] LOVE, HOPPING AROUND.
[ct=6412.791] HE FIRES THAT ONE AWAY AND
[ct=6414.536] ALMOST HAS IT PICKED OFF.
[ct=6418.602] KIRK: DETROIT FANS ARE THINKING
[ct=6419.312] THIS IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.
[ct=6423.557] THERE IS A LOT TO LIKE WITH THIS
[ct=6423.887] YOUNG TEAM.
[ct=6427.996] YOU LOOK AT THEM AND IT IS ALL
[ct=6427.996] ABOUT WHO WILL BE ABLE TO STAY
[ct=6428.549] HEALTHY.
[ct=6430.972] THEY HAVE TO STAY HEALTHY LIKE
[ct=6432.938] EVERY TEAM.
[ct=6434.160] YOU LOOK AT THEIR SCHEDULE AND
[ct=6436.149] THE WAY IT WORKS OUT THE NEXT
[ct=6437.679] FEW WEEKS WITH CAROLINA.
[ct=6439.431] THEY ARE AT TAMPA AND BALTIMORE.
[ct=6442.937] VEGAS, RAMS, BEARS.
[ct=6446.509] THEY COULD LEGITIMATE GET
[ct=6449.464] AL: NO DOUBT.
[ct=6453.500] CAUGHT AT THE 40.
[ct=6458.655] KIRK: AND WE SHOULD MENTION NOT
[ct=6460.813] JUST FOR TONIGHT BUT BIG PICTURE
[ct=6464.001] TO SEE RYAN BRANCH COME BACK
[ct=6468.633] AFTER HAVING BEEN CARTED OFF --
[ct=6468.953] THAT IS SIGNIFICANT AND GO
[ct=6469.449] NEWS.
[ct=6472.678] AL: THIRD AND ONE.
[ct=6476.134] BRANCH HAS THAT MOUTHPIECE.
[ct=6476.724] THERE IT IS.
[ct=6478.891] I WATCHED THE OPENING GAME AND I
[ct=6482.909] WONDERED IF IT WAS A BINKY, A
[ct=6483.178] PACIFIER.
[ct=6484.675] KIRK: [LAUGHTER]
[ct=6488.030] AL: A PACIFIER.
[ct=6493.739] AND THAT IS RUSTLED FOR AN --
[ct=6499.314] WRESTLED FOR AND CAUGHT.
[ct=6500.676] HE'S SOMEHOW SOMEWAY MADE A
[ct=6503.482] BEAUTIFUL GRAB LAST WEEK
[ct=6505.071] THIS ONE FOR 35 YARDS.
[ct=6510.990] KIRK: HE SOMEHOW PULLS THE BALL
[ct=6512.259] AWAY FROM HIM AND STAYS IN
[ct=6512.805] BOUNDS FOR THE COMPLETION.
[ct=6515.850] MATT LAFLEUR SAID THIS IS A
[ct=6518.202] YOUNG GROUP OF RECEIVERS AND
[ct=6519.160] THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THIS
[ct=6528.237] AL: REED -- UH OH, THERE IS
[ct=6529.023] BRANCH WHO HAD COME BACK INTO
[ct=6535.761] KIRK: YOU APPRECIATE THE
[ct=6537.699] TOUGHNESS AND TRYING TO BATTLE
[ct=6538.661] THROUGH BUT YOU HAVE TO BE
[ct=6541.463] THINKING ABOUT THE BIG PICTURE
[ct=6542.450] KEEPING HIM HEALTHY FOR THE LONG
[ct=6543.328] HATHE SECOND TIME TONIGHT.
[ct=6546.294] BACK TO ACTION.
[ct=6547.932] SECOND AND FIVE.
[ct=6551.207] LOVE GOES TO HIS LEFT AND HAS IT
[ct=6551.655] PICKED OFF AT THE FIVE YARD
[ct=6553.899] JERRY JACOBS.
[ct=6557.043] AND RUNOUT AT THE 18.
[ct=6560.412] SECOND PICK TONIGHT COMING WITH
[ct=6561.529] FOUR MINUTES TO GO AND PRETTY
[ct=6564.972] MUCH PUTTING A BOW ON IT.
[ct=6569.108] KIRK: SOMETIMES WHEN YOU HAVE AN
[ct=6569.684] ATHLETIC QUARTERBACK THAT CAN
[ct=6572.118] CREATE RECEIVERS GET USED TO
[ct=6573.919] HAVING TO BAIL AND GET OFF ON A
[ct=6574.237] ROUTE.
[ct=6577.236] THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS.
[ct=6577.641] HE WILL WORK FROM THE LEFT.
[ct=6582.987] I HAVE TO HELP MY GUY OUT.
[ct=6584.645] HE STARTS TO GO INTO SCRAMBLE
[ct=6584.645] MODE.
[ct=6589.387] HE GETS THE BALL OUT OF HIS
[ct=6590.984] HANDS BECAUSE HE THINKS HE HAS
[ct=6590.984] AN OPENING.
[ct=6593.617] HE WORKED FROM THE RIGHT BACK TO
[ct=6593.617] THE LEFT.
[ct=6596.750] AND THE BALL HAS ALREADY BEEN
[ct=6597.324] RELEASED FOR THE INTERCEPTION.
[ct=6601.540] AL: JACOBS PLAYED AT ARKANSAS,
[ct=6602.497] THIRD YEAR IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=6606.084] SECOND PICK OF HIS CAREER RIGHT
[ct=6609.175] MONTGOMERY ADDING TO HIS
[ct=6614.563] MONTGOMERY HAS -- MONTGOMERY IS
[ct=6615.317] GOING TO CLOSE IN ON A TRIPLE
[ct=6616.268] DIGIT NIGHT.
[ct=6621.304] MAN OH MAN, HE HAS BEEN THE
[ct=6621.810] WORKHORSE.
[ct=6626.298] 27 CARRIES FOR 97 YARDS COMING
