[ct=11.819] THERAPY IS, NOT ENOUGH SCREEN
[ct=11.819] TIME, EVERYONE IS MAD ABOUT
[ct=13.112] SOMETHING AND THIS IS HIS TIME
[ct=13.118] IN THE SUN.
[ct=21.919] STEVEN SIMS RUNS IT BACK, SEAN
[ct=22.660] IS TONIGHT'S REFEREE.
[ct=28.829] >> RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE.
[ct=33.823] >> HOLDING BY THE RECEIVING
[ct=35.210] TEAM, 10 YARD PENALTY.
[ct=36.760] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=43.535] >> C.J. STROUD PLAYED COLLEGE
[ct=45.681] FOOTBALL AT OHIO STATE, NUMBER
[ct=48.699] TWO OVERALL PICK BEHIND BRYCE
[ct=51.219] YOUNG, YOUNG WENT TO THE
[ct=53.157] PANTHERS AND STROUD HAD A
[ct=57.658] TREMENDOUS SEASON, OFFENSE OF
[ct=62.117] ROOKIE OF THE YEAR, HIS RATIO
[ct=64.759] WAS GREAT LAST YEAR, THIS YEAR,
[ct=64.962] GOOD.
[ct=66.171] HE STARTS FROM THE 16 YARD LINE.
[ct=73.032] JUST BRING PRESSURE, THE PASS IS
[ct=73.239] BROKEN UP.
[ct=79.635] THE BACKUP TIGHT END D.J. REED
[ct=82.954] BREAKING IT UP, SECOND DOWN AND
[ct=82.954] 10.
[ct=88.351] >> WE WILL SEE HOW BOBBY SLOAN
[ct=89.032] ATTACKS AGAINST THE JETS.
[ct=95.256] WE TALKED ABOUT TOP RECEIVERS,
[ct=96.350] NICO COLLINS HOPEFULLY BACK IN
[ct=96.911] ANOTHER WEEK.
[ct=103.498] AS A DUO THEY LEAD THE NFL FOR
[ct=105.936] THOUSANDS OF YARDS RECEIVING SO
[ct=107.212] HOW WILL THEY OVERCOME LOSSES?
[ct=113.063] >> ROBERT WOODS, A LITTLE
[ct=115.351] HESITATION IN THE HANDOFF IN THE
[ct=115.351] BACKFIELD.
[ct=119.362] ANOTHER FLAG ON THE PLAY, TO
[ct=121.932] PENALTIES IN THE FIRST NINE
[ct=122.244] SECONDS.
[ct=127.243] >> WILLIAMS TRYING TO GET A
[ct=127.243] QUICK JUMP ON THE SNAP COUNT.
[ct=132.220] YEAH, THE JETS ARE THE MOST
[ct=136.573] PENALIZED TEAM, PART OF THE
[ct=136.573] REASON THEY HAVE BEEN SO
[ct=136.981] INCONSISTENT.
[ct=141.881] >> OFFSIDES BY THE DEFENSIVE
[ct=144.710] TACKLE, THE NUMBER WAS 95.
[ct=150.438] >> THERE IT IS, IT IS WILLIAMS
[ct=152.649] AND SECOND DOWN AND FIVE, SO
[ct=155.489] JEFF TOOK OVER THREE GAMES AGO.
[ct=161.317] 0-3 AFTER ROBERT SALA WAS 2-3
[ct=161.879] AND FIRED AFTER A TRIP TO
[ct=162.331] LONDON.
[ct=168.885] HOLBROOK IS CALLING DEFENSIVE
[ct=171.562] SIGNALS SO DOING DOUBLE DUTY IS
[ct=171.922] STROUD.
[ct=175.214] THAT IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=178.236] ROBERT WOODS WAS THE INTENDED
[ct=178.516] RECEIVER.
[ct=182.594] THIRD AND FIVE FOR THE TEXANS.
[ct=187.333] >> THIS DEFENSE IS BEING
[ct=192.286] CHALLENGED, HUSTLING, TACKLING,
[ct=195.392] HERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO
[ct=195.392] GET STROUD OFF THE FIELD.
[ct=200.874] WITHOUT COLLINS YOU'VE GOT THE
[ct=205.298] TIGHT ENDS, SEE IF SOMEBODY CAN
[ct=205.837] SEPARATE FROM THIS COVERAGE.
[ct=209.175] GIVEN AN OPTION.
[ct=215.364] >> RECEIVER IS SET, FINDS THE
[ct=220.555] OPEN MAN, TANK DELL MAKING THE
[ct=221.319] CATCH.
[ct=224.819] HE WAS NICKNAMED BY HIS MOTHER,
[ct=226.341] HE WAS A TANK WHEN HE WAS
[ct=226.553] THROWING.
[ct=228.561] 16 YARDS.
[ct=236.427] >> C.J. STROUD, GREAT JOB, NOT
[ct=240.718] FOOLED AT ALL, HE WAS TELLING ME
[ct=242.554] BEFORE THE GAME HE HATES TO LOSE
[ct=248.660] BUT HAS CONFIDENCE IN TANK DELL,
[ct=249.990] XAVIER HUTCHINSON STEPPING.
[ct=253.791] THE VETERAN WILL GET AN
[ct=253.791] OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=264.117] >> OFF THE FAKE, RUNNING AROUND,
[ct=266.159] FIRES.
[ct=268.335] SECOND DOWN AND 10.
[ct=274.815] NICO COLLINS HAS BEEN GREAT, HE
[ct=275.909] WAS LEADING THE LEAGUE WHEN HE
[ct=276.974] WENT OUT WITH AN INJURY BUT HE
[ct=277.191] IS BACK.
[ct=282.988] >> GREAT TO SEE HIM GET BACK AND
[ct=284.308] IF YOU HAVE NOT FOLLOWED THE
[ct=287.358] TEXANS, ONE THING THAT IS MOST
[ct=290.177] CONCERNING IS C.J. STROUD
[ct=291.487] PRESSURED AS MUCH AS ANY
[ct=291.703] CORNERBACK.
[ct=299.436] KENYON GREEN HAS HAD HIS ISSUES
[ct=299.745] SO IF YOU WILL HAVE TO GET THE
[ct=300.064] RUNNING GAME GOING.
[ct=309.980] >> PASS IS CAUGHT, DALTON
[ct=309.998] SCHULTZ TACKLED BY QUINCY
[ct=310.738] WILLIAMS.
[ct=312.929] THEY STARTED WITH FIVE
[ct=317.346] CONSECUTIVE PASSES, THIRD-FOUR.
[ct=322.809] EVENTUALLY WE WILL SEE A LOT OF
[ct=328.993] JOE MIXON TONIGHT, HE HAS DONE
[ct=329.452] THE JOB AS AARON RODGERS WAITS
[ct=329.996] ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=333.260] JOE MIXON CAME FROM CINCINNATI
[ct=336.423] AND HAS BEEN GREAT.
[ct=337.171] DAVANTE ADAMS CAME OVER TWO
[ct=341.562] WEEKS AGO, READY FOR THE FIRST
[ct=345.793] OPPORTUNITY, KEEP IT GOING ON A
[ct=346.969] THIRD DOWN AND FOUR.
[ct=353.247] SIXTH IN A ROW, AVOIDS THE SACK,
[ct=353.802] THROWS UNDER PRESSURE.
[ct=358.959] HAASON REDDICK HELD OUT, GOT HIM
[ct=362.141] IT A TRADE BUT HE SAID HE WANTED
[ct=363.144] A NEW CONTRACT, HERE HE IS.
[ct=368.000] >> HE RUNS HIMSELF INTO PRESSURE
[ct=371.469] WITH REDDICK, DOES ENOUGH TO
[ct=371.710] AFFECT STROUD.
[ct=375.405] MCDONALD HELPING TO CLEAN THAT
[ct=378.664] UP, JUST NOWHERE TO GO WITH THAT
[ct=378.887] FOOTBALL.
[ct=384.008] >> THE PUNTER IS TOMMY TOWNSEND.
[ct=390.670] XAVIER IS BACK, TOWNSEND CAME
[ct=392.306] FROM KANSAS CITY, WINNING SUPER
[ct=392.470] BOWLS WITH THE CHIEFS.
[ct=398.283] HIGH FLOATING CAKE, CAUGHT AT
[ct=399.100] THE 11TH YARD LINE AND THAT IS
[ct=403.414] WHERE AARON RODGERS AND THE JETS
[ct=409.818] 5:00 P.M. EASTERN TIME.
[ct=416.404] YOUR GO THE JETS, ROGERS OUT OF
[ct=417.925] THE PISTOL, STRAIGHT DROPBACK,
[ct=420.400] THROWS DOWN THE SIDELINE, OUT OF
[ct=424.401] BOUNDS, RECOVERED BY DEREK
[ct=428.399] STINGLEY, SECOND AND 10.
[ct=430.499] AARON RODGERS HAS HAD BETTER
[ct=432.072] YEARS, MANY BETTER.
[ct=436.341] 12 TOUCHDOWNS, SEVEN
[ct=436.521] INTERCEPTIONS, NOT BAD.
[ct=441.628] 60 2%, 237 YARDS PER GAME.
[ct=449.435] >> THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST
[ct=449.695] TIMES WE'VE SEEN DAVANTE ADAMS
[ct=453.960] GET DOWNFIELD AND HE WAS OPEN,
[ct=454.474] ROGERS MISSES IT.
[ct=458.239] >> DATA IS DROPPED AT THE 15
[ct=460.414] YARD LINE, TRIES TO GET IT TO
[ct=462.102] BREECE HALL WHO IS A GOOD
[ct=462.338] CATCHER.
[ct=464.598] OUTSTANDING RUNNER.
[ct=467.600] QUICKLY 3-10.
[ct=470.779] -- THIRD-10.
[ct=474.280] >> APPEARS TO PLAYS.
[ct=476.417] A MISSED GO BALL AND A DROP FOR
[ct=478.942] FIVE YARDS BY BREECE HALL.
[ct=482.015] THIRD AND 10.
[ct=490.681] >> DATE PLAYS, 64 HOUSTON, NO
[ct=490.681] RUNS, ALL PASSES.
[ct=501.258] PASS NUMBER NINE, LOOK OUT,
[ct=501.927] SACKED AT THE 1-YARD LINE.
[ct=506.542] THAT WAS NICO COMING IN FOR THE
[ct=506.542] SACK.
[ct=508.417] ANOTHER GUY THEY PICKED UP.
[ct=514.843] A FREE AGENT FROM TENNESSEE LAST
[ct=515.197] YEAR.
[ct=517.937] GETS THE SACK HERE.
[ct=524.671] >> THIRD AND LONG WITH ANDERSON
[ct=527.218] AND HUNTER, THEY ARE SO QUICK
[ct=528.048] THAT IT FREES UP THE MIDDLE,
[ct=531.288] THEY END UP BRINGING SIX AND HOW
[ct=534.614] GREAT IS IT TO SEE THEM SHOWING
[ct=538.144] WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH 11 AND A
[ct=538.828] HALF SACKS WITH TENNESSEE, FIRST
[ct=539.129] WITH THE TEXANS.
[ct=543.534] >> THOMAS MORSTEAD RIGHT AT THE
[ct=547.336] END OF THE END ZONE, LITTLE ROOM
[ct=550.000] TO GET IT AWAY BUT HE DOES AND
[ct=550.902] IT IS OUT OF BOUNDS MIDFIELD.
[ct=555.035] TEXANS WILL TAKE OVER AT THAT
[ct=556.342] SPOT WITH 11 MINUTES 44 SECONDS
[ct=557.611] REMAINING IN THE OPENING
[ct=557.611] QUARTER.
[ct=562.787] >> LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR
[ct=563.242] NEXGEN STATS.
[ct=566.538] LOOK AT THE INTERIOR OFFENSE OF
[ct=567.841] LINE IN THE FIRST EIGHT WEEKS OF
[ct=568.222] THE SEASON.
[ct=571.551] THE MOST SACKS IN THE ENTIRE
[ct=575.079] NFL, YOU SEE THAT PRESSURE AND
[ct=578.532] YOU GOT THE JETS CREATING RUSHER
[ct=579.304] MUCH LIKE THE HOUSTON DEFENSE.
[ct=584.434] YOU SAID IT, A LOT OF PASSES.
[ct=586.086] WE WILL SEE IF THEY CREATE MORE
[ct=586.289] BALANCE.
[ct=594.943] >> RUNNING BACK IN THE SACK AND
[ct=597.297] BEFORE JOE MIXON CAN GET IT
[ct=597.297] ANOTHER FLAG.
[ct=602.578] >> FALSE START, OFFENSE, FIVE
[ct=602.839] YARD PENALTY.
[ct=606.134] >> HE LEADS THE LEAGUE IN
[ct=606.341] PENALTIES.
[ct=611.104] >> 13TH ACCEPTED PENALTY THIS
[ct=614.054] YEAR, THE MOST, A LOT OF
[ct=617.283] NEGATIVITY TONIGHT, THE MOST IN
[ct=617.283] THE NFL.
[ct=621.449] INTERIOR MOST PRESSURE, LEFT
[ct=623.726] TACKLE, MOST PENALTIES BUT IT
[ct=624.487] WILL GET BETTER.
[ct=631.764] AL: THE JETS IN A MOMENT OF
[ct=634.555] DARKNESS CHOSE TO WORE BLACK
[ct=634.812] TONIGHT.
[ct=643.045] -- CHOSE TO WEAR BLACK FINALLY A
[ct=645.967] RUN BUT ONLY A COUPLE.
[ct=651.403] YOU BEGIN TO THINK HE WILL LOSE
[ct=652.524] A LITTLE BIT, NOT THIS GUY THIS
[ct=656.067] KIRK: I AM WITH YOU.
[ct=658.432] WATCHING HIM, GOING BACK TO
[ct=661.698] OKLAHOMA AND THE BENGALS, A LOT
[ct=663.929] OF PEOPLE THOUGHT HIS BEST YEARS
[ct=664.673] WERE BEHIND HIM.
[ct=667.161] I THINK HE ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A
[ct=668.128] ROOKIE.
[ct=669.630] HE LOOKS MORE EXPLOSIVE,
[ct=672.145] AVERAGING ALMOST 5 YARDS PER
[ct=672.685] CARRY.
[ct=675.913] I THINK A CHANGE OF SCENERY
[ct=676.101] HELPED HIM OUT.
[ct=679.862] AL: THAT WAS A GAIN OF TWO,
[ct=683.244] SECOND AND 13.
[ct=685.014] LOOK OUT FROM BEHIND, SACKED.
[ct=688.242] THAT TIME IT IS D.J. REED.
[ct=690.570] TRACK HIM DOWN FROM BEHIND.
[ct=695.257] KIRK: YOU HAVE D.J. REED LINED
[ct=696.166] UP ON DALTON SCHULTZ, THE TIGHT
[ct=699.696] END, THEY WILL BRING THE CORNER
[ct=699.696] PRESSURE.
[ct=708.331] ONE TOO MANHY ON THE LEFT SIDE,
[ct=712.231] REED IS UNDERSIZED BUT PLAYS
[ct=712.971] WITH AN ATTITUDE.
[ct=715.488] AL: DOES NOT BLITZ A OFTEN.
[ct=719.898] IT IS HIS FIRST SACK IN SIX
[ct=720.230] YEARS.
[ct=722.754] THIRD AND 21 NOW.
[ct=725.389] STROUD, STEPPING UP.
[ct=731.406] IT IS ALMOST INTERCEPTED AT THE
[ct=732.050] 42 YARD LINE.
[ct=737.873] JALEN MILLS DIVING AT A PASS
[ct=738.136] INTENDED FOR TANK DELL.
[ct=740.454] RODGERS GETTING READY TO GO BACK
[ct=741.114] TO WORK.
[ct=743.277] KIRK: YOU GET A LITTLE PRESSURE
[ct=743.549] FROM REDDICK.
[ct=746.553] HE HAS SUCH GOOD GET OFF.
[ct=750.444] C.J. STROUD STEPS UP AND FLICKS
[ct=751.943] THE WRIST.
[ct=756.717] CLARK ALMOST STEPS IN FRONT FOR
[ct=757.395] A HUGE INTERCEPTION.
[ct=765.988] REFEREE: PLEASE RESET THE GAME
[ct=770.017] THANK YOU.
[ct=773.887] AL: WE HAVE PLAYED 4:45.
[ct=779.138] THREE PENALTIES, THREE SACKS.
[ct=786.960] AND TOWNSEND'S SECOND PUNT, AND
[ct=787.600] HERE IS A FLAG AGAIN.
[ct=789.853] HE GOT KNOCKED DOWN.
[ct=793.493] IS IT RUNNING INTO OR ROUGHING?
[ct=795.615] HE IS ON THE GROUND.
[ct=798.758] TOMMY TOWNSEND GETS RUN INTO.
[ct=802.158] THE TEXANS RIGHT NOW --
[ct=808.542] REFEREE: PERSONAL FOUL, ROUGHING
[ct=809.515] THE KICKER.
[ct=811.038] 15 YARD PENALTY, AUTOMATIC FIRST
[ct=811.118] DOWN.
[ct=815.194] AL: HOW MANY TIMES THIS YEAR
[ct=816.403] HAVE WITHIN THE PLACE KICKER OR
[ct=816.718] THE PUNTER GET RUN INTO.
[ct=820.898] KIRK: TERRY MACAULEY SAYING HE
[ct=821.166] HIT THE PLANT LEG.
[ct=823.512] THAT IS ROUGHING.
[ct=831.153] THE JETS DEFENSE DOES ITS JOB, A
[ct=832.224] CHANCE TO GET THE FOOTBALL BACK.
[ct=834.974] ANOTHER MICROCOSM OF THEIR
[ct=835.669] SEASON.
[ct=841.109] AL: THAT WAS A FOURTH AND 21.
[ct=846.281] A FIRST DOWN AND THE BALL IS ON
[ct=846.959] THE 49 OF THE JETS.
[ct=854.490] STROUD HAS STARTED 2-7 FOR 22
[ct=854.756] YARDS.
[ct=855.357] MIXON.
[ct=860.594] PICKS UP ABOUT THREE.
[ct=862.920] SECOND DOWN AND 7.
[ct=870.485] KIRK: TAKING A LOOK AT THE
[ct=870.800] PUNTER.
[ct=874.176] HE WAS RUN INTO ON THE PLANT
[ct=874.515] FOOT.
[ct=876.950] HOPEFULLY HE IS OK.
[ct=880.908] DEMECO RYANS TRYING TO GET THIS
[ct=881.143] OFFENSE GOING.
[ct=886.419] SUCH POTENTIAL, EVEN WITH DIGGS
[ct=886.676] AND COLLINS DOWN.
[ct=889.717] THEY ARE TRYING TO SET UP THE
[ct=890.111] PLAY-ACTION GAME.
[ct=892.222] AL: TRYING AGAIN.
[ct=896.929] BIG ENOUGH HOLE.
[ct=900.045] CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=901.493] IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND SHORT.
[ct=906.994] KIRK: KENYON GREEN TAKES A SO
[ct=908.688] MUCH, THE FANS GET FRUSTRATED
[ct=908.991] WITH HIM AT LEFT GUARD.
[ct=912.498] WATCH THIS A BLOCK.
[ct=915.178] GET INTO HIM, ENGAGE AND THEN
[ct=915.178] BURY HIM.
[ct=917.094] LOOK AT THE WHOLE OPEN UP FOR
[ct=921.556] AL: SOLOMON THOMAS GETS HURT ON
[ct=921.556] THE PLAY.
[ct=926.925] HE HAS BEEN HAVGOES TO THE SIDEL
[ct=928.145] WILL CHECK THEM OUT IN THE BLUE
[ct=928.451] TENTS.
[ct=931.686] KIRK: ONE OF HIS OWN PLAYERS.
[ct=934.389] GETS BLOCKED INTO HIS LOWER
[ct=934.699] BODY.
[ct=939.358] GOOD TO SEE HIM WALKING THAT
[ct=939.358] OFF.
[ct=942.838] TEXANS NOT ABLE TO PICK UP THE
[ct=943.479] FIRST DOWN ON THE RUN BY MIXON.
[ct=945.859] THIRD AND SHORT.
[ct=949.562] AL: THIRD AND INCHES, JUST
[ct=949.873] INSIDE THE 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=952.789] STILL EARLY IN THE FIRST
[ct=954.743] TO THE OUTSIDE HE GOES.
[ct=957.983] MIXON, BOUNCING OFF TACKLES!
[ct=962.244] RUNNING THROUGH TACKLES, ALL THE
[ct=963.132] WAY TO THE 11 YARD LINE!
[ct=968.906] WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MIXON IN
[ct=969.471] HIS EIGHTH SEASON, HOW MUCH
[ct=970.819] JUICE DOES HE HAVE LEFT?
[ct=973.101] THAT SHOWS IT.
[ct=976.740] KIRK: CLEMENS IS ABLE TO WORK
[ct=976.740] AROUND GREEN.
[ct=979.331] THE CUT AND PICKS UP THE FIRST
[ct=981.164] HE THROWS THE SHOULDER.
[ct=983.541] THIS IS A DIFFERENT JOE MIXON.
[ct=987.021] PHYSICALITY, RUNNING THROUGH
[ct=987.301] WOULD BE TACKLES.
[ct=989.423] CHUCK CLARK COMING UP.
[ct=991.175] WHAT AGAIN.
[ct=994.173] AL: 29 YARD PICKUP FOR MIXON.
[ct=1003.109] OGUNBOWALE IS IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=1007.153] DARE HAS IT, GOES NOWHERE,
[ct=1010.478] STUFFED BY QUINNEN WILLIAMS.
[ct=1012.614] SECOND DOWN AND 11.
[ct=1015.678] KIRK: A GOOD JOB ON THE BACKSIDE
[ct=1019.113] OF THE JETS DEFENSE OF FLOWING
[ct=1020.473] TO THE FOOTBALL, NOT TAKING A
[ct=1020.715] PLAY OFF.
[ct=1024.076] HE WANTED TO CUT THAT BACK BUT
[ct=1026.055] THERE WAS NO ROOM BECAUSE OF THE
[ct=1026.318] EFFORT ON THE BACKSIDE.
[ct=1029.593] THIS IS WHERE YOU MISSED COLLINS
[ct=1032.652] AND DIGGS, DOWN IN THESE AREAS
[ct=1034.345] WHERE YOU HAVE TO MAKE QUICK
[ct=1034.851] DECISIONS AS A QUARTERBACK.
[ct=1037.785] THIS IS WHERE TANK DELL IN THE
[ct=1040.676] SLOT TO THE LEFT HAS TO GET A
[ct=1041.194] CHANCE TO GET INTO AN OPEN HOLE.
[ct=1044.586] AL: STROUD PRESSURED, LOSES THE
[ct=1044.815] BALL!
[ct=1049.395] THE JETS COME UP WITH THE
[ct=1049.680] FOOTBALL INSIDE THE 20 YARD
[ct=1050.245] LINE.
[ct=1053.102] WILL MCDONALD IS THE MAN WHO
[ct=1053.466] RECOVERED IT.
[ct=1055.895] QUINNEN WILLIAMS FORCE THE
[ct=1055.895] ISSUE.
[ct=1057.555] KIRK: THERE IT IS.
[ct=1059.163] THE INTERIOR.
[ct=1062.000] KENYON GREEN, THE LEFT GUARD.
[ct=1064.679] HE HAS TO BE ABLE TO MATCHUP.
[ct=1065.855] TOUGH TASK.
[ct=1069.616] QUINNEN WILLIAMS HAS BEEN COMING
[ct=1069.845] ON IN RECENT WEEKS.
[ct=1072.676] KNOTT'S THE BALL AWAY FROM C.J.
[ct=1077.894] NOW IT IS ON THE BALL AND WILL
[ct=1078.453] MCDONALD JUMPS ON TOP OF IT.
[ct=1082.734] THE JETS DEFENSE HAS COME UP
[ct=1082.948] WITH SOME BIG STOPS.
[ct=1088.296] AL: STROUD PLAYED THE WORST GAME
[ct=1089.446] OF HIS CAREER IN THIS BALLPARK
[ct=1089.872] LAST YEAR, LOSING TO THE JETS
[ct=1092.185] AND SUFFERING A CONCUSSION.
[ct=1094.837] OFF TO A RAGGED START TONIGHT.
[ct=1097.800] ON THE GROUND AND HE RECOVERS
[ct=1097.800] IT.
[ct=1102.066] HALL OFF TO A GOOD START ON THAT
[ct=1105.367] RUN WAS A LOT OF ROOM, GETS A
[ct=1108.374] LITTLE EXCITED, LOSES THE
[ct=1108.937] FOOTBALL AND COMES UP WITH IT.
[ct=1113.131] NOW YOU HAVE WILL ANDERSON DOWN
[ct=1113.419] FOR THE TEXANS.
[ct=1120.541] KIRK: JETS VERY FORTUNATE TO GET
[ct=1120.679] THAT FOOTBALL BACK.
[ct=1131.192] IT LOOKED LIKE HEWITT KNOCKED
[ct=1131.729] IT OUT.
[ct=1135.543] WILL ANDERSON IS ONE OF THE BEST
[ct=1135.774] PLAYERS IN THE NFL.
[ct=1138.864] ANOTHER LOWER BODY.
[ct=1143.886] AL: HE WAS JUST NAMED THE OF 7.5
[ct=1148.781] SACKS, HAVING A GREAT SEASON,
[ct=1149.328] NEEDS ASSISTANCE INTO THE BLUE
[ct=1150.208] TENT.
[ct=1157.802] THE JETS AFTER THE FUMBLE BY
[ct=1160.587] BREECE HALL, HE RECOVERS IT
[ct=1160.933] HIMSELF.
[ct=1163.608] NEVILLE HEWITT WILL COME IN.
[ct=1166.685] ANDERSON, AT LEAST OUT FOR THE
[ct=1166.685] MOMENT.
[ct=1169.771] UP THEY STILL HAVE FATUKASI.
[ct=1173.605] THEY HAVE THE DEAL HUNTER ON THE
[ct=1173.866] OTHER SIDE.
[ct=1178.469] KIRK: AUTRY HAS THE ABILITY TO
[ct=1179.029] PLAY INSIDE AND OUTSIDE.
[ct=1181.066] AL: SECOND AND 9.
[ct=1184.892] DAVANTE ADAMS.
[ct=1190.265] THAT IS PRETTY ODD AFTER ALL
[ct=1192.514] BAY.
[ct=1195.419] KIRK: HE IS BLOCKING STINGLEY
[ct=1196.093] DOWNFIELD.
[ct=1198.240] EVEN THOUGH HE HAS BEEN HERE A
[ct=1200.733] FEW WEEKS, IT IS STILL A WORK IN
[ct=1201.773] PROGRESS WITH DAVANTE ADAMS.
[ct=1207.256] JUST BECAUSE HE HAS THAT
[ct=1207.472] EXPERIENCE WITH AARON ROGERS
[ct=1209.089] DOES NOT MEAN HE HAS PICKED UP
[ct=1209.248] THE OFFENSE.
[ct=1212.352] HE DOES NOT THINK HE IS INVOLVED
[ct=1212.581] IN THE PLAY.
[ct=1216.622] AARON IMPROVISES SO OFTEN ON THE
[ct=1216.856] PLAY.
[ct=1221.415] HE IS LOOKING AT ADAMS, LIKE "WE
[ct=1222.880] HAVE TO GET THIS GOING."
[ct=1225.732] AL: THIRD AND 9.
[ct=1225.937] RODGERS.
[ct=1228.773] A LITTLE TOO FAR.
[ct=1232.164] THAT IS INCOMPLETE, INTENDED FOR
[ct=1234.599] MIKE WILLIAMS, WHO COULD VERY
[ct=1235.486] MUCH BE ON THE TRADING BLOCK.
[ct=1239.621] THE BOOS RAIN DOWN ON THE JETS.
[ct=1242.733] FOURTH AND 9.
[ct=1245.372] KIRK: LOOK AT ALL THE BODIES.
[ct=1248.228] SEVEN GUYS, ONE DROPS.
[ct=1250.929] THEY STILL BRING THE NICKEL,
[ct=1252.839] PITRE.
[ct=1256.823] BECAUSE OF THAT PRESSURE, AARON
[ct=1257.390] ROGERS NOT SETTLED, NOT
[ct=1257.747] COMFORTABLE.
[ct=1259.643] AL: THOMAS MORSTEAD.
[ct=1262.136] DRAFTED IN 2009.
[ct=1266.601] HE AND MATTHEW STAFFORD ARE THE
[ct=1267.187] ONLY PLAYERS REMAINING FROM THAT
[ct=1267.187] DRAFT.
[ct=1269.169] STAFFORD WITH NUMBER 1.
[ct=1273.032] THAT IS OUT OF BOUNDS AROUND THE
[ct=1273.256] 11.
[ct=1277.636] , OF COURSE, ON THE TRADING
[ct=1277.909] BLOCK.
[ct=1281.107] TALKING ABOUT BEING MOVED FOR
[ct=1281.562] ABOUT A YEAR NOW.
[ct=1284.630] FINALLY THEY MAKE THE MOVE ANY
[ct=1286.321] WINDS APPEAR WITH HIS OLD BUDDY.
[ct=1290.033] KIRK: EVERYONE EXPECTED IT WOULD
[ct=1292.050] WORK OUT IN THE BLINK OF AN
[ct=1292.539] EYE.
[ct=1295.589] THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND A
[ct=1295.589] RHYTHM.
[ct=1298.774] AL: THIS DRIVE STARTS AT THE 13
[ct=1299.014] YARD LINE.
[ct=1303.558] FINDING A CREASE, MIXON TACKLED
[ct=1306.590] BY NUMBER 52.
[ct=1308.773] IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN.
[ct=1313.721] KIRK: THIS IS A DEFENSE, AS
[ct=1317.203] ATHLETIC AS THEY ARE, AS MUCH AS
[ct=1318.347] THEY CAN PRESSURE THE
[ct=1320.354] QUARTERBACK -- YOU HAVE YOUR TWO
[ct=1322.230] STARTING SAFETIES DOWN, YOU'RE
[ct=1325.307] STARTING MIDDLE LINEBACKER, C.J.
[ct=1325.609] MOSLEY, DOWN.
[ct=1328.895] YOU THINK IF YOU COULD ATTACK IT
[ct=1329.432] WOULD BE IN THE INTERIOR.
[ct=1333.974] AL: SECOND AND 3.
[ct=1336.586] OFF HE GOES AGAIN.
[ct=1340.748] MAINTAINS HIS BALANCE AND PICKED
[ct=1342.607] UP A NICE GAIN BUT A FLAG IS
[ct=1346.830] THE TEXANS ARE ALREADY STARTING
[ct=1347.089] BACK.
[ct=1350.584] REFEREE: HOLDING BY THE OFFENSE,
[ct=1350.584] NUMBER 87.
[ct=1354.027] 10 YARD PENALTY, REPEAT SECOND
[ct=1358.289] IT WAS A 17 YARD GAIN, IN
[ct=1362.315] INSTEAD IT IS STOVER WITH THE
[ct=1362.608] PENALTY.
[ct=1365.125] KIRK: HE IS JUST TRYING TO HELP.
[ct=1368.995] HE IS TRYING TO PUSH ALL OF HER
[ct=1368.995] OUT.
[ct=1373.289] HE IS ABLE TO GET AWAY SO HE HAS
[ct=1373.588] TO GRAB ONTO THE JERSEY.
[ct=1377.198] THAT PLAY HAD A CHANCE TO BE A
[ct=1377.434] BIG ONE.
[ct=1380.582] AL: MEANWHILE, YOU HAVE D.J.
[ct=1383.808] REED GETTING ASSISTANCE AS HE
[ct=1384.645] MOVES OVER TO THE SIDELINE.
[ct=1389.990] COMING OUT AT LEAST FOR ONE PLAY
[ct=1391.170] AS HE TROTS TO THE SIDELINE.
[ct=1396.143] AFTER THE PENALTY, IT WILL BE
[ct=1407.929] 5:30 LEFT IN THE FIRST QUARTER,
[ct=1413.351] SECOND AND 11.
[ct=1414.827] FROM THE 12.
[ct=1420.076] FOUR-MAN RUSH, ENOUGH TO GET
[ct=1420.076] HIM.
[ct=1423.591] BACK ON THE GROUND AT THE 7-YARD
[ct=1428.134] KIRK: IT IS NOT THAT WE ARE
[ct=1428.462] PICKING ON KENYON GREEN BUT HE
[ct=1428.752] HAS BEEN A ROUGH YEAR.
[ct=1432.755] HE GOT BENCHED LAST WEEKEND
[ct=1433.701] JARRETT PATTERSON CAME IN BUT HE
[ct=1434.007] GOT HURT.
[ct=1437.060] RIGHT NOW HE IS GETTING
[ct=1437.288] OVERPOWERED.
[ct=1440.244] QUINNEN WILLIAMS GOES RIGHT
[ct=1440.244] THROUGH HIM.
[ct=1442.896] WE HAVE SEEN HIM GET AROUND WITH
[ct=1443.136] QUICK THIS.
[ct=1446.912] THAT TIME HE USES POWER TO GO
[ct=1447.053] RIGHT THROUGH HIM.
[ct=1450.841] IT IS A COMBINATION OF GREEN
[ct=1454.396] STRUGGLING AND QUINNEN WILLIAMS
[ct=1455.648] PLAYING UP TO HIS LEVEL THE LAST
[ct=1456.988] THREE OR FOUR WEEKS.
[ct=1464.953] AL: MEANWHILE, THE PASS OUT TO
[ct=1466.024] THE 18 YARD LINE GOES TANK DELL.
[ct=1468.495] IT IS FOURTH DOWN AND 6.
[ct=1470.809] HERE COMES THE PUNT GROUP.
[ct=1474.266] KAYLEE: AFTER TOMMY TOWNSEND GOT
[ct=1476.920] RUN INTO ON HIS LAST PUNCH HE
[ct=1478.984] CAME TO THE SIDELINES, TOOK A
[ct=1482.437] COUPLE PRACTICE PUNTS INTO THE
[ct=1482.665] NET, GAVE A THUMBS UP.
[ct=1486.461] HE USED A MASSAGE GUN ON HIS
[ct=1488.480] RIGHT CALF AND EVEN PRACTICED
[ct=1488.480] HOLDING.
[ct=1490.179] AL: THERE HE IS.
[ct=1491.782] HE IS BACK.
[ct=1495.988] XAVIER GIPSON IS SET UP INSIDE
[ct=1496.943] HIS 30.
[ct=1500.490] TOWNSEND WILL PUT IT IN THE AIR
[ct=1503.805] FOR THE SECOND OFFICIAL TIME THE
[ct=1507.291] HE WENT INTO THE TENT.
[ct=1510.732] THE JETS BEGINNING THERE DRIVE
[ct=1512.583] FROM THE 31-YARD LINE.
[ct=1514.847] A GAIN OF EIGHT.
[ct=1517.671] RODGERS TONIGHT IS 0-4.
[ct=1524.042] IN HIS ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER,
[ct=1527.053] NOW IN HIS 20TH SEASON, HE HAS
[ct=1529.846] NEVER GONE 0-5 TO START A GAME.
[ct=1534.465] KIRK: IT IS AN OFFENSE THAT HAS
[ct=1534.465] POTENTIAL BASED ON THE PIECES
[ct=1534.695] THEY HAVE.
[ct=1537.941] IT HAS BEEN VERY INCONSISTENT.
[ct=1542.960] THAT IS THE THING THAT HAS BEEN
[ct=1543.440] DRIVING AARON ROGERS AND
[ct=1544.144] EVERYBODY CRAZY.
[ct=1546.582] AL: THEY PUT BRAELON ALLEN IN A
[ct=1548.769] TWO-BACK SET.
[ct=1552.718] OFF TO THE RACES GOES BREECE
[ct=1552.718] HALL.
[ct=1556.073] GIVES THE CROWD SOMETHING TO
[ct=1556.717] CHEER ABOUT.
[ct=1557.243] A GAIN OF 16.
[ct=1560.576] KIRK: THE TIGHT END IS ABLE TO
[ct=1561.870] STEAL IT AND THE TACKLE ON THE
[ct=1565.642] LEFT SIDE, SMITH, IS ABLE TO GET
[ct=1565.939] AROUND.
[ct=1568.682] 17, ADAMS, ABLE TO HELP OUT.
[ct=1573.214] IF YOU GET BREECE HALL OUT THERE
[ct=1574.176] , HE CAN DO SOME DAMAGE.
[ct=1576.762] HE IS A GREAT RECEIVER OUT OF
[ct=1577.309] THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=1580.608] WHEN HE SQUARES THOSE SHOULDERS
[ct=1581.642] UP, HE IS A TALENTED BACK.
[ct=1587.731] AL: TODD DOWNING TOOK OVER AS
[ct=1588.406] THE PLAY CALLER FROM NATHANIEL
[ct=1588.716] HACKETT.
[ct=1591.772] 'S FIRST COMPLETION IS FOR A
[ct=1592.327] LOSS.
[ct=1597.161] AARON FINALLY GETS A COMPLETION
[ct=1599.769] BUT BREECE HALL LOSES TWO.
[ct=1601.135] SECOND AND 12.
[ct=1604.827] KIRK: TO'OTO’O, WHO MISSED LAST
[ct=1606.131] WEEK, JUST EYED
[ct=1608.862] TIME.
[ct=1610.132] THEY TRIED TO SELL IT.
[ct=1613.051] THE OFFENSE OF LINE MIGHT HAVE
[ct=1613.376] TIPPED THEIR HAND EARLY.
[ct=1616.050] WATCH 39.
[ct=1617.705] HE IS OUT THERE TO BEAT BREECE
[ct=1622.571] NO CHANCE THAT PLAY HAD BECAUSE
[ct=1623.805] OF THE INSTINCTS BY 39.
[ct=1629.335] AL: ADAMS MOVING.
[ct=1631.796] RODGERS GOES TO HIM.
[ct=1635.784] HE IS COVERED IMMEDIATELY AND
[ct=1642.250] TAKEN DOWN BY KAMARI LASSITER.
[ct=1645.351] KAYLEE: WHEN WILL ANDERSON CAME
[ct=1647.038] OFF THE FIELD YOU SAW HIM
[ct=1650.580] PUTTING VERY LITTLE WEIGHT ON
[ct=1650.793] THE LEFT LEG.
[ct=1651.959] HE SPENT EIGHT MINUTES IN THE
[ct=1653.735] BLUE MEDICAL TENT.
[ct=1657.082] HE CAME OUT AND DID SOME DRILLS
[ct=1657.798] TO TEST IT OUT.
[ct=1660.636] HE LOOKS TO HAVE A VERY HEAVY
[ct=1662.602] TAPE JOB ON HIS LEFT ANKLE.
[ct=1665.776] AL: HE IS BACK IN THE GAME ON
[ct=1666.483] THIRD DOWN AND 7.
[ct=1668.757] BRAELON ALLEN IS IN THE
[ct=1677.496] PASS IS BEHIND WILSON BUT HE IS
[ct=1680.035] ABLE TO REACH BACK, MAKE THE
[ct=1680.575] CATCH AND PICK UP THE FIRST
[ct=1687.125] GARRETT WILSON, REACHING BACK
[ct=1688.200] AND SAVING IT, PICKS UP THE
[ct=1688.200] FIRST.
[ct=1690.929] KIRK: THAT IS A GREAT JOB BY
[ct=1691.177] AARON ROGERS.
[ct=1693.727] LOOK AT STINGLEY LOSING GROUND.
[ct=1695.410] HE KNEW RIGHT AWAY.
[ct=1699.015] EVEN THOUGH THE BALL WAS BEHIND
[ct=1700.183] WILSON A LITTLE BIT, IT IS HIS
[ct=1704.234] RECOGNITION OF WHERE THE SOFT
[ct=1704.607] SPOT WAS VERSUS THAT PRESSURE.
[ct=1706.477] WILSON MAKES A GREAT PLAY ON THE
[ct=1711.921] AL: HIS 52ND RECEPTION, LEADS
[ct=1711.921] THE TEAM.
[ct=1715.432] HALL, NOWHERE TO ROAM.
[ct=1720.403] SECOND DOWN.
[ct=1720.747] THAT MIGHT TAKE US TO THE END OF
[ct=1721.109] THE QUARTER.
[ct=1723.547] YOU NEVER KNOW WITH AARON.
[ct=1726.355] KIRK: THIS IS AN OFFENSE THAT
[ct=1726.737] HAS BEEN ONE DIMENSIONAL.
[ct=1731.500] A LATE FLAG JUST CAME IN.
[ct=1739.130] AL: SHAWN HOCHULI -- THE CROWD
[ct=1739.797] WANTS A FACEMASK AFTER LOOKING
[ct=1740.368] AT THE REPLAY.
[ct=1744.047] REFEREE: PERSONAL FOUL, FACE
[ct=1744.348] MASK, NUMBER 91.
[ct=1761.962] KIRK: WHERE WAS THAT LAST WEEK
[ct=1763.025] WITH OUR GAME BETWEEN MINNESOTA
[ct=1763.025] AND L.A.?
[ct=1765.222] THAT WAS A LATE FLAG.
[ct=1768.307] I DO NOT KNOW IF REPLAY HELP
[ct=1768.703] WITH THAT.
[ct=1771.480] THE PLAY WAS OVER AND THEN THE
[ct=1772.330] FLAG CAME IN.
[ct=1775.581] THE RIGHT CALL -- YOU LOVE TO
[ct=1776.018] SEE THE RIGHT CALL BEING MADE.
[ct=1779.169] AL: THE CROWD SAW AND IN THE
[ct=1779.572] FLAG CAME OUT.
[ct=1781.693] NOT THAT THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE.
[ct=1783.919] THE OFFICIALS WERE TALKING ABOUT
[ct=1791.671] IT IS SORT OF MUTED TONIGHT.
[ct=1792.870] KIRK: YEAH.
[ct=1795.253] VERY DIFFERENT FROM BEFORE.
[ct=1797.362] AL: ABSOLUTELY.
[ct=1799.999] DO THAT.
[ct=1805.931] AL: A LITTLE TOSS, PLENTY OF
[ct=1806.259] ROOM, ALL THE WAY TO THE END
[ct=1806.259] ZONE!
[ct=1810.891] MALACHI CORLEY, A ROOKIE OUT OF
[ct=1811.393] WESTERN KENTUCKY.
[ct=1815.490] 19 YARDS.
[ct=1819.453] INTO THE END ZONE HE GOES.
[ct=1822.896] KIRK: THE QUESTION IS, DID HE
[ct=1824.828] DROP THE FOOTBALL BEFORE HE
[ct=1826.002] CROSSES THE PLANE.
[ct=1828.235] IT WILL BE VERY, VERY CLOSE.
[ct=1831.535] AL: THAT IS WHAT DEMECO RYANS IS
[ct=1831.973] LOOKING AT.
[ct=1835.514] HE DOES NOT HAVE TO BECAUSE ALL
[ct=1836.137] SCORING PLAYS GET REVIEWED.
[ct=1838.296] KIRK: THE EXECUTION IS GREAT.
[ct=1842.184] OH, BOY, HE DROP THAT BALL.
[ct=1844.994] DEFINITELY GOING TO TAKE A PEEK
[ct=1844.994] AT THAT.
[ct=1849.900] REFEREE: THE RULING ON THE FIELD
[ct=1850.270] OF A TOUCHDOWN IS UNDER FURTHER
[ct=1850.879] REVIEW.
[ct=1854.070] AL: TERRY MACAULEY, WHAT DO YOU
[ct=1854.474] SAY?
[ct=1858.087] TERRY: HE CLEARLY DROPS THE
[ct=1858.662] FOOTBALL BEFORE IT BREAKS THE
[ct=1858.878] PLANE.
[ct=1863.919] WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO
[ct=1864.692] THE FOOTBALL AFTER THAT.
[ct=1867.147] IF THE JETS RECOVER, IT IS A
[ct=1867.438] TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=1871.936] IF THE TEXANS RECOVER, IT IS A
[ct=1872.476] TOUCHBACK.
[ct=1875.302] IF IT GOES OUT OF BOUNDS, IT IS
[ct=1875.670] A TOUCH BACK.
[ct=1878.336] IF IT JUST SITS THERE, IT GOES
[ct=1880.169] BACK TO THE JETS AT THE SPOT OF
[ct=1880.725] THE FUMBLE.
[ct=1886.165] REFEREE: THE RUNNER DROPPED THE
[ct=1888.643] BALL BEFORE CROSSING THE GOAL
[ct=1891.557] THE BALL THEN SUBSEQUENTLY
[ct=1893.647] ROLLED TO THE BACK OF THE END
[ct=1895.359] ZONE AND OUT OF THE END ZONE.
[ct=1897.391] IT IS A TOUCH BACK.
[ct=1899.808] IT IS A FIRST DOWN FOR THE
[ct=1899.870] DEFENSE.
[ct=1903.767] KIRK: THERE IT GOES ROLLING
[ct=1904.097] TOWARD THE BACK LINE.
[ct=1907.865] ONCE THE BALL HITS THE WHITE, IT
[ct=1910.482] IS THE TEXANS' BALL FOR A
[ct=1916.871] THE ROOKIE CORLEY, WHAT IN THE
[ct=1917.433] HECK IS HE THINKING?
[ct=1920.642] EVEN IF IT IS CLOSED, FINISH THE
[ct=1924.634] KIRK: DID IN THE END ZONE.
[ct=1927.383] AL: YOU SEE IT TIME AND TIME
[ct=1927.383] AGAIN.
[ct=1931.113] THE FIRST RUSH OF HIS CAREER, HE
[ct=1931.679] WILL REMEMBER FOREVER.
[ct=1933.883] MIXON LOOKING FOR ROOM.
[ct=1936.754] IN THAT SITUATION, HAD THE JETS
[ct=1940.582] RECOVER IN THE END ZONE, IT
[ct=1940.868] WOULD HAVE BEEN A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=1945.106] KIRK: KEEP IN MIND, YOU ARE
[ct=1945.696] TALKING ABOUT A TEAM THAT IS
[ct=1946.010] STRUGGLING.
[ct=1948.283] THEY HAVE LOST FIVE IN A ROW.
[ct=1952.049] THEIR INTERIM HEAD COACH HAS
[ct=1953.127] BEEN THE HEAD COACH FOR THREE
[ct=1953.467] GAMES.
[ct=1956.568] THEY ARE 2-6, THEY ARE DESPERATE
[ct=1957.192] TO GET A WIN.
[ct=1960.557] DESPERATE TO DO THE LITTLE
[ct=1961.898] THINGS RIGHT AND WE HAVE SEEN
[ct=1961.898] THE SAME ERRORS.
[ct=1965.091] THEY COULD BE UP SEVEN AND
[ct=1965.764] FEELING GOOD ABOUT WHERE THEY
[ct=1965.764] ARE.
[ct=1968.245] AL: SECOND AND 8.
[ct=1974.424] THE COVERAGE IS GOOD AND HE GETS
[ct=1974.424] TAKEN DOWN AT THE 25 YARD LINE
[ct=1976.940] BY QUINCY WILLIAMS.
[ct=1981.147] KIRK: THIS JETS DEFENSE IS DOING
[ct=1983.168] EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO BAIL OUT
[ct=1983.926] THEIR OWN OFFENSE.
[ct=1990.224] WHETHER THE OFFENSE HAS GIVEN
[ct=1991.995] THE TEXANS GOOD FIELD POSITION,
[ct=1994.575] WHETHER IT WAS LIKE THIS, A
[ct=1994.781] MISTAKE THAT WAS MADE.
[ct=1998.011] THEY ARE ONCE AGAIN TRYING TO
[ct=2000.844] HELP THEIR OWN OFFENSE OUT, GET
[ct=2002.717] GOOD FIELD POSITION BACK TO
[ct=2007.125] AL: THE WAY THEY HAVE LOST THESE
[ct=2008.281] FIVE GAMES, IT HAS BEEN IN EVERY
[ct=2008.686] MANNER.
[ct=2010.231] AND NOW YOU HAVE THIS.
[ct=2012.027] THAT IS SOMETHING NEW.
[ct=2015.242] IT COMES BACK TO HAUNT THEM ON
[ct=2015.698] HALLOWEEN NIGHT.
[ct=2021.742] OVER THE MIDDLE, TOO HIGH,
[ct=2023.596] INTENDED FOR JOHN METCHIE.
[ct=2025.492] IT IS FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=2027.617] KIRK: ANOTHER PRESSURE.
[ct=2031.317] THIS TIME IT IS QUINNEN WILLIAMS
[ct=2032.083] AGAIN ON THE LEFT SIDE.
[ct=2034.692] GREEN, HE IS ACTUALLY DOWN.
[ct=2036.736] WILLIAMS WENT THROUGH HIM.
[ct=2038.591] HE WILL WORK IN.
[ct=2042.263] THE LEFT GUARD SPOT AGAIN FOR
[ct=2042.557] THE TEXANS.
[ct=2045.040] THE WRIT MOVE.
[ct=2050.039] IT IS NOT -- THE RIP MOVE.
[ct=2051.101] IT IS NOT ALWAYS ABOUT THE SACK.
[ct=2055.795] JOHN METCHIE DOES A GOOD JOB
[ct=2057.894] TRYING TO GET SEPARATION, WHICH
[ct=2058.935] HE GAINS.
[ct=2060.152] BUT BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE, IT
[ct=2062.178] GETS STROUD IN A LITTLE BIT OF A
[ct=2062.534] HURRY.
[ct=2065.892] AS HE THREW THE FOOTBALL, HE WAS
[ct=2066.449] HIT BY QUINNEN WILLIAMS.
[ct=2070.571] AL: GREEN WAS PICKED IN THE
[ct=2072.197] FIRST ROUND BACK IN 2022, CAME
[ct=2077.092] OUT OF LAST WEEK'S GAME, JARRETT
[ct=2077.092] PATTERSON CAME IN, HE GOT HURT.
[ct=2081.361] PATTERSON AN ACTIVE THIS WEEK
[ct=2082.635] AND NOW GREEN IS ON THE TURF AT
[ct=2082.793] METLIFE.
[ct=2093.938] EARLY IN THE SECOND QUARTER.
[ct=2097.569] IN A GAME BEING PLAYED IN
[ct=2097.902] QUICKSAND.
[ct=2108.959] KIRK: ZERO FLOW TWO THIS
[ct=2109.663] FOOTBALL GAME SO FAR.
[ct=2110.354] [LAUGHTER]
[ct=2113.874] AL: LESS THAN.
[ct=2116.209] KIRK: HOW ABOUT WE START OVER?
[ct=2118.282] AL: GOOD IDEA.
[ct=2121.015] WE WERE TALKING TO AARON ROGERS.
[ct=2126.328] HE WAS CONVINCING TELLING US HE
[ct=2127.791] KNEW A PATH.
[ct=2129.298] KIRK: VERY THOROUGH.
[ct=2131.897] AL: HE WENT THROUGH THE ENTIRE
[ct=2132.491] SCHEDULE.
[ct=2142.407] MORE STEAD -- TOMMY TOWNSEND.
[ct=2145.644] A FAIR CATCH.
[ct=2146.540] THEY WILL START FROM THERE.
[ct=2150.610] AARON, HE CAN SELL YOU A FEW
[ct=2150.907] THINGS.
[ct=2155.460] I WAS GOING TO BUY THE BROOKLYN
[ct=2157.350] BRIDGE AFTER THAT CONVERSATION.
[ct=2160.064] HE WENT THROUGH EVERY GAME AND
[ct=2163.486] SAID TWO WEST COAST TEAMS
[ct=2164.080] PLAYING 10:00 IN THE MORNING.
[ct=2166.185] MIAMI COULD BE ANYTHING.
[ct=2169.237] KIRK: HE ALSO COMPARED SOME OF
[ct=2171.253] HIS GREEN BAY TEAMS THAT GOT UP
[ct=2173.039] TO A SLOW START.
[ct=2174.333] HE TALKED ABOUT THIS TEAM AND
[ct=2174.678] THIS TEAM AND SAID THIS JETS
[ct=2178.104] TEAM IS BETTER THAN A LOT OF
[ct=2178.486] THOSE TEAMS IF YOU LOOK AT THE
[ct=2178.898] PERSONNEL.
[ct=2182.492] THE REST OF THEIR SCHEDULE, IF
[ct=2184.234] THEY CAN GET A WIN TONIGHT.
[ct=2187.970] AL: A SHORT GAME TO DAVANTE
[ct=2187.970] ADAMS.
[ct=2190.971] TACKLED BY MURRAY.
[ct=2193.079] A GAIN OF THREE.
[ct=2198.378] KIRK: HE HAS HAD SOME OPEN
[ct=2198.378] RECEIVERS.
[ct=2203.809] NOT ABLE TO GET ON TRACK AND BE
[ct=2203.809] ABLE TO FIND THEM.
[ct=2206.987] WHETHER IT IS HIM OTHER
[ct=2208.224] RECEIVERS, THEY ARE JUST NOT ON
[ct=2208.363] THE SAME PAGE.
[ct=2212.327] AL: TRYING TO PICK UP THE PACE
[ct=2212.327] IN THE NO-HUDDLE.
[ct=2214.531] THE PLAY CLOCK ALL THE WAY DOWN
[ct=2216.397] TO 12.
[ct=2220.377] KIRK: FOR A TEAM THAT HAS
[ct=2221.074] STRUGGLED WITH HER OPERATION AT
[ct=2223.008] TIMES -- LAST WEEK THEY
[ct=2227.185] HAD TO CALL A TIMEOUT.
[ct=2230.280] AL: THEY HAD TO USE ALL THREE IN
[ct=2230.843] THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=2233.844] THEY HAD A DELAY OF GAME ON A
[ct=2234.409] TWO-POINT CONVERSION.
[ct=2236.797] BREECE HALL FOR A MINIMUM GAIN.
[ct=2238.434] THIRD DOWN AND 6.
[ct=2244.053] KIRK: THIS DEFENSIVE LINE FOR
[ct=2244.262] HOUSTON HAS STRENGTHENED QUICK
[ct=2244.853] THIS ON THE INSIDE.
[ct=2247.686] THE ROTATE A LOT OF BODIES.
[ct=2251.031] AL: TOO EARLY FOR THAT.
[ct=2254.118] THAT IS A SHOT YOU NORMALLY SEE
[ct=2254.729] LATE IN THE FOURTH.
[ct=2256.194] THIRD AND 6.
[ct=2258.773] LOOK OUT.
[ct=2261.366] RODGERS SPINS AWAY, THROWS, COT.
[ct=2263.029] THE BALL IS OUT.
[ct=2265.524] DID HE HAVE CONTROL?
[ct=2267.669] THIS IS NEVILLE HEWITT.
[ct=2270.804] HE WILL TAKE THE BALL ALL THE
[ct=2271.380] WAY IN FOR A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=2274.278] KIRK: THEY CALL THAT A CATCH AND
[ct=2274.728] A FUMBLE ON THE FIELD.
[ct=2276.921] AL: TYLER CONKLIN.
[ct=2280.095] KIRK: GREAT JOB.
[ct=2283.165] I AM SURE THEY WILL TAKE A PEEK
[ct=2284.510] AT THIS TO SEE IF HE HAS
[ct=2285.332] POSSESSION.
[ct=2288.125] THAT IS AN INCOMPLETION.
[ct=2289.879] THAT BALL WAS BOBBLED.
[ct=2291.802] AL: TOTALLY.
[ct=2296.168] KIRK: THE JETS THIS TIME CATCH A
[ct=2296.787] BREAK.
[ct=2305.149] AL: IT WILL BE OVERTURNED.
[ct=2308.518] SO WE HAD A NEAR-TOUCHDOWN FROM
[ct=2309.048] THE JETS.
[ct=2312.837] WE HAVE A SORT OF NEAR-TOUCHDOWN
[ct=2313.195] FOR THESE GUYS.
[ct=2317.820] KIRK: RODGERS HAS NOT BEEN ABLE
[ct=2318.543] TO MOVE AROUND MUCH IN THE
[ct=2318.804] POCKET LATELY.
[ct=2321.012] THAT WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS.
[ct=2329.422] KNOCKED AWAY BY PITRE, CAUSING
[ct=2329.422] THE INCOMPLETION.
[ct=2331.453] THERE IS CONKLIN.
[ct=2335.004] THE RECIPIENT OF THE PASS.
[ct=2340.966] MEANWHILE, YOU HAVE THOMAS
[ct=2341.470] MORSTEAD BACK TO PUNT.
[ct=2343.547] HIS THIRD OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=2346.780] TOMMY TOWNSEND HAS ALREADY
[ct=2347.294] PUNTED THREE TIMES.
[ct=2350.502] STEVEN SIMS IS BACK FOR THE JETS
[ct=2354.544] , INSIDE THE 30-YARD LINE.
[ct=2364.605] SIMS, BACKING UP.
[ct=2364.605] BEAUTIFUL KICK.
[ct=2366.366] LOOK AT THIS BABY.
[ct=2368.356] WHOA!
[ct=2370.697] 2-YARD LINE.
[ct=2373.298] KIRK: THAT IS THE PLAY OF THE
[ct=2373.298] GAME.
[ct=2376.574] AL: BY FAR!
[ct=2379.443] THOMAS MORSTEAD.
[ct=2382.757] THAT IS 75 YARDS OF PERFECTION.
[ct=2384.089] ABSOLUTELY.
[ct=2391.697] NOT ONLY ANGLED DEEP, SIMS HAD
[ct=2393.689] TO GO OVER, AND THEN
[ct=2395.301] STAYS IN BOUNDS AND IS DOWNED AT
[ct=2397.100] THE 2-YARD LINE.
[ct=2400.847] KIRK: GREAT JOB BY
[ct=2401.899] BERNARD-CONVERSE NOT JUMPING.
[ct=2404.446] SOMETIMES THEY GET NERVOUS.
[ct=2406.801] HE LET THAT ROLLED ALL THE WAY
[ct=2408.983] DOWN TO THE 2-YARD LINE.
[ct=2412.179] AL: THOMAS MORSTEAD HAS PUNTED
[ct=2416.309] 935 TIMES, THAT IS HIS LONGEST
[ct=2416.856] AVERAGE.
[ct=2421.201] MEANWHILE, YOU HAVE MIXON GIVING
[ct=2421.862] THEM SOME ROOM, TAKING IT OUT TO
[ct=2425.075] THE 7-YARD LINE.
[ct=2426.684] YOU ARE RIGHT, THAT IS THE PLAY
[ct=2427.019] OF THE GAME.
[ct=2432.153] KIRK: THIS IS THE THIRD LEFT
[ct=2432.153] GUARD.
[ct=2436.320] PATTERSON IS DOWN THIS WEEK.
[ct=2441.772] KENDRICK GREEN GETS HIS
[ct=2447.480] THAT IS 95, QUINNEN WILLIAMS,
[ct=2448.109] ACROSS FROM YOU.
[ct=2448.445] GOOD LUCK.
[ct=2450.086] AL: GODSPEED.
[ct=2452.372] SECOND AND 5.
[ct=2456.041] NICE MOVE AGAIN.
[ct=2463.098] KAYLEE: AN INJURY REPORT FOR
[ct=2463.098] YOU.
[ct=2468.952] WITH KENDRICK GREEN IN THE GAME,
[ct=2471.020] THAT IS BECAUSE KENYON GREEN IS
[ct=2471.265] IN THE X-RAY ROOM.
[ct=2475.540] WE ARE TOLD HE IS QUESTIONABLE
[ct=2475.883] TO RETURN BECAUSE OF A SHOULDER
[ct=2476.174] INJURY.
[ct=2480.608] WE SAW C.J. STROUD FALL ON IT
[ct=2480.949] WHEN HE CAME UP HURTING.
[ct=2486.307] FOR THE JETS DEFENSE, CORNERBACK
[ct=2488.761] D.J. REED IS QUESTIONABLE TO
[ct=2488.975] RETURN.
[ct=2491.722] HE IS BEING EVALUATED FOR A
[ct=2491.985] CONCUSSION.
[ct=2495.277] SOLOMON THOMAS IS QUESTIONABLE
[ct=2496.685] BECAUSE OF A KNEE.
[ct=2499.098] AL: BRANDIN ECHOLS COMES IN.
[ct=2501.692] 10 MINUTES TO PLAY IN THE HALF.
[ct=2505.495] STILL NO SCORE.
[ct=2509.772] KIRK: ECHOLS IN COLLEGE PLAY
[ct=2510.032] CORNER.
[ct=2512.848] IN THE NFL HE HAS BEEN PLAYING
[ct=2513.227] NICKEL.
[ct=2519.156] ECHOLS HAS THE ONLY TWO
[ct=2521.440] INTERCEPTIONS THIS ENTIRE YEAR.
[ct=2527.261] THIS JETS DEFENSE HAS ONLY TWO
[ct=2528.500] PICKS THIS YEAR.
[ct=2534.351] AL: NO PICKS FOR GARDNER OR REED
[ct=2536.929] EIGHT GAMES INTO THE SEASON.
[ct=2539.172] HUGE HOLE.
[ct=2542.104] MIXON HAS DONE ALL THE WORK ON
[ct=2542.393] THIS DRIVE.
[ct=2546.369] HE HAS TAKEN THEM FROM THE 2-
[ct=2549.207] YARD LINE TO THE 26TH.
[ct=2552.115] KIRK: THE DEFENSE SHOWS PRESSURE
[ct=2552.729] AND THEN THEY BAIL.
[ct=2555.984] IT MAKES IT EASIER FOR THE GUARD
[ct=2556.499] IN THE CENTER TO GET UP TO THE
[ct=2558.029] BACKERS.
[ct=2560.622] THAT PLAY JUST OPENED UP.
[ct=2563.327] THE INTERIOR IS WHERE THE TEXANS
[ct=2565.419] WANT TO WORK WITH C.J. MOSLEY
[ct=2571.175] AL: MIXON GETS A REST.
[ct=2573.429] OFF THE PLAY FAKE.
[ct=2575.209] THE CATCH IS MADE.
[ct=2578.865] TRYING TO STAY IN BOUNDS, THAT
[ct=2579.123] IS DALTON SCHULTZ.
[ct=2582.499] NICE MOVE, TURNS NOTHING INTO
[ct=2582.844] SOMETHING.
[ct=2586.142] BREAKING AWAY AND MAKING A GAIN
[ct=2586.511] OF SEVEN.
[ct=2588.971] KIRK: SAUCE GARDNER IS SUCH A
[ct=2592.435] GREAT PLAYER BUT AN AREA THAT HE
[ct=2593.006] HAS TO GET BETTER IS TACKLING.
[ct=2595.016] BOOM!
[ct=2598.276] RIGHT THERE, WRAPPED HIM UP.
[ct=2601.427] DALTON SCHULTZ IS A GOOD PLAYER
[ct=2602.837] BUT YOU HAVE QUINCY WILLIAMS AND
[ct=2605.821] SAUCE GARDNER AND POOR TACKLING.
[ct=2608.225] THAT LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD BE A
[ct=2611.160] LOSS OF THREE OR FOUR, BUT
[ct=2612.064] INSTEAD HE PICKS UP SEVEN YARDS.
[ct=2615.634] AL: THAT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE.
[ct=2617.560] IT HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF PUB.
[ct=2619.141] MIXON IS BACK.
[ct=2621.374] IS HE EVER.
[ct=2623.332] WHAT A NIGHT HE IS HAVING.
[ct=2625.534] A FLAG IS DOWN.
[ct=2629.811] REFEREE: HOLDING, BY THE
[ct=2630.116] OFFENSE, NUMBER 2.
[ct=2633.440] 10 YARD PENALTY, REPLAY SECOND
[ct=2637.404] KIRK: ROBERT WOODS, THE VETERAN,
[ct=2637.951] AGAINST JALEN MILLS.
[ct=2641.421] I APOLOGIZE EARLIER I WAS
[ct=2643.184] TALKING ABOUT CHUCK CLARK, HE IS
[ct=2645.098] ON THE I.R..
[ct=2649.401] MILLS HAD TO STEP UP.
[ct=2653.479] WOODS, THAT IS WHAT HE IS KNOWN
[ct=2653.479] FOR.
[ct=2657.208] A GUY WHO IS A GREAT RECEIVER
[ct=2658.896] BUT PEOPLE APPRECIATE HOW
[ct=2659.405] PHYSICAL HE CAN BE.
[ct=2662.373] HE WRAPS UP AROUND THE SHOULDERS
[ct=2665.153] OF MILLS AND MAKES IT AN EASY
[ct=2665.776] CALL FOR THE OFFICIALS.
[ct=2669.468] AL: FIVE PENALTIES NOW ON THE
[ct=2669.672] TEXANS.
[ct=2672.664] THAT NEGATES WHAT WOULD HAVE
[ct=2674.496] BEEN A 15-YARD GAIN.
[ct=2679.605] STROUD IS UNDER PRESSURE AGAIN,
[ct=2680.695] FLUSHED OUT, FIRES DEEP DOWN
[ct=2681.000] FIELD.
[ct=2682.815] IT IS THE CATCH MADE?
[ct=2688.264] IT IS, AT THE 45-YARD LINE BY
[ct=2688.563] ROBERT WOODS.
[ct=2690.705] A GAIN OF 32.
[ct=2693.112] STROUD EXTENDS THE PLAY.
[ct=2696.564] WOODS, DOES HE STAY IN BOUNDS?
[ct=2699.234] KIRK: THE TEXANS WILL GO HURRY
[ct=2700.926] UP TO SEE IF THEY CAN GET THE
[ct=2703.428] BALL SNAPPED BEFORE THE RED FLAG
[ct=2703.789] COMES OUT.
[ct=2707.876] AL: STROUD, ON THE MOVE AGAIN.
[ct=2713.389] KIRK: ROBERT WOODS ADJUSTING
[ct=2716.525] THIS IS A DRILL THEY WORK ON
[ct=2720.573] BECAUSE OF STROUD'S ABILITY TO
[ct=2720.840] PLAYOFF SCHEDULE.
[ct=2724.290] THE LEFT FOOT IS DOWN FOR SURE,
[ct=2725.252] DOES THE OTHER FOOT DID DOWN?
[ct=2728.489] IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS.
[ct=2729.123] ONE OF PLAY BY THE VETERAN.
[ct=2732.804] HE MAKES UP FOR THE HOLDING CALL
[ct=2735.543] TO THE GATE THE 15-YARD GAIN.
[ct=2738.106] HE IS RUNNING A ROUTE AND SEES
[ct=2738.804] HIS QUARTERBACK IS IN TROUBLE.
[ct=2740.515] HE COMES BACK AND GIVES STROUD
[ct=2742.037] AN OPTION.
[ct=2745.530] AL: YOU SEE THE PEBBLES COME UP.
[ct=2747.941] THAT IS ALWAYS THE TELLTALE
[ct=2748.260] SIGN.
[ct=2752.044] SAUCE GARDNER MISS IS A TACKLE
[ct=2752.743] AND GETS BEAT ON THAT PLAY.
[ct=2755.611] STROUD ROLLING UNDER PRESSURE,
[ct=2757.188] THROWING AND THAT PASS IS
[ct=2757.744] INCOMPLETE.
[ct=2761.601] ANOTHER FLAG DOWN AS YOU HAD
[ct=2761.935] LEONARD TAYLOR COMING IN.
[ct=2765.008] MEANWHILE, SAUCE GARDNER IS
[ct=2767.631] WE WILL HEAR FROM SHAWN HOCHULI
[ct=2767.852] IN A SECOND.
[ct=2772.015] REFEREE: BEFORE THE PASS WAS
[ct=2772.651] THROWN, HOLDING, DEFENSE NUMBER
[ct=2772.995] 1.
[ct=2776.533] IT IS A FIVE YARD PENALTY AND AN
[ct=2777.102] AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2779.850] AL: THAT IS A BAD TRIFECTA.
[ct=2783.143] YOU HAVE A MISSED TACKLE, YOU
[ct=2785.387] GET BEATEN, YOU HAVE A PENALTY
[ct=2786.170] AND NOW YOU ARE HURT.
[ct=2789.288] KIRK: SAUCE GARDNER WAS VIEWED
[ct=2790.712] COMING INTO THIS YEAR -- THERE
[ct=2794.449] IS THE GRAB -- AS ONE OF THE TOP
[ct=2794.449] CORNERS IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=2796.987] THIS YEAR, LIKE A LOT OF THE
[ct=2800.037] JETS PLAYERS, THINGS HAVE NOT
[ct=2800.370] BEEN THE SAME.
[ct=2802.627] TEAMS HAVE NOT AVOIDED HIM.
[ct=2805.326] THEY HAVE ACTUALLY GONE AFTER
[ct=2809.254] AL: HE HAD FIVE PENALTIES ALL OF
[ct=2811.442] LAST YEAR, HE HAS FIVE ALREADY
[ct=2811.660] THIS SEASON.
[ct=2815.435] DEFENSIVE ROOKIE OF THE YEAR IN
[ct=2816.920] '22.
[ct=2822.208] KIRK: TEXANS TRYING TO COME UP
[ct=2822.752] WITH ANSWERS BECAUSE OF THE LEFT
[ct=2823.326] GUARD POSITION.
[ct=2825.795] A LOT OF THE ANSWERS ARE MOVE
[ct=2829.333] STROUD AROUND, RUN THE FOOTBALL
[ct=2830.797] AND GET HIM AWAY FROM THE
[ct=2831.418] PRESSURE IN THE INTERIOR.
[ct=2840.587] AL: KENDALL SHEFFIELD COMES IN
[ct=2840.790] FOR SAUCE GARDNER.
[ct=2843.102] THERE GOES MIXON AGAIN.
[ct=2847.794] AN 11-YARD GAIN FOR JOE MIXON.
[ct=2850.231] WE HAVE ANOTHER INJURY.
[ct=2854.939] THAT IS 12 CARRIES FOR 86 YARDS.
[ct=2858.915] YOU HAVE WILL MCDONALD, WHO IS
[ct=2859.502] THE INJURED JETS
[ct=2859.831] THE INJURED JET.
[ct=2863.494] KIRK: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE
[ct=2863.494] LEFT GUARD.
[ct=2867.397] HOW WILL HE DO?
[ct=2867.397] HE HELPS CLEAN UP.
[ct=2870.146] HE GOT AWAY WITH A HOLD WITH HIS
[ct=2870.491] LEFT ARM.
[ct=2874.710] THEY ARE REALLY HAVING SUCCESS
[ct=2875.062] THROUGH THE INTERIOR.
[ct=2881.673] 99, MCDONALD, STILL DOWN ON THE
[ct=2886.106] AL: HE LEADS THE TEAM IN SACKS,
[ct=2887.549] HE HAS EIGHT.
[ct=2892.391] CLOCK TO 6:41.
[ct=2895.580] AL: STILL DOWN.
[ct=2898.581] YOU HAD ANDERSON GOING OUT FOR A
[ct=2901.461] WHILE FOR THE TEXANS.
[ct=2903.407] HE IS THEIR LEADING SACKER.
[ct=2906.317] NOW YOU HAVE MCDONALD DOWN.
[ct=2913.698] ADAMS AND RODGERS GOING, "I
[ct=2915.332] DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING
[ct=2915.332] ABOUT.
[ct=2918.332] WE HAVE TO GET SOMETHING GOING."
[ct=2923.537] THIS DRIVE STARTED BACK AT THE 2
[ct=2926.617] AFTER THAT 75-YARD PUNT.
[ct=2931.411] HERE IS THE MCDONALD PLAY AGAIN.
[ct=2933.804] KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE HE AVOIDS
[ct=2934.411] CONTACT.
[ct=2938.325] IN THE EFFORT TO AVOID IT, HE
[ct=2938.831] MUST HAVE TWEAKED SOMETHING.
[ct=2941.891] AL: A NONCONTACT INJURY.
[ct=2949.240] ACL LAST WEEK, GONE FOR THE
[ct=2952.694] SAUCE GARDNER ON THE SIDELINE
[ct=2953.092] FOR A MOMENT.
[ct=2959.257] KIRK: JOE MIXON IS DOING A NICE
[ct=2959.257] JOB.
[ct=2963.107] HE IS THE BENEFICIARY OF THE WAY
[ct=2963.791] THEY HAVE BEEN BLOCKING ON THE
[ct=2966.973] INTERIOR, AVERAGING OVER SEVEN
[ct=2967.248] YARDS PER CARRY.
[ct=2969.831] THEY HAVE MIXED UP THEIR
[ct=2970.499] PERSONNEL, KEEPING THIS JETS
[ct=2973.326] DEFENSE OFF BALANCE.
[ct=2976.866] AL: WE HAVE SEEN MIXON FOR
[ct=2979.416] HE IS LOOKING AS GOOD AS WE HAVE
[ct=2979.701] EVER SEEN HIM.
[ct=2983.137] KIRK: IT IS THE BEST HE HAS
[ct=2983.921] LOOKED IN SIX OR SEVEN YEARS.
[ct=2986.926] AL: ANOTHER BAD SIGN FOR THE
[ct=2988.235] NYJ.
[ct=2995.659] KIRK: A BIG PART OF THIS
[ct=2997.659] DEFENSIVE FRONT IS THE DEPTH
[ct=2999.582] THEY HAVE TYPICALLY HAD OVER THE
[ct=3001.873] YEARS AND ROTATING.
[ct=3003.873] THEY ARE SO VIOLENT, SO
[ct=3004.137] AGGRESSIVE.
[ct=3007.106] THEY MIGHT NEED HIM TO GET SOME
[ct=3010.406] DEPTH ON THE DEFENSIVE FRONT.
[ct=3013.441] THEY PLAY SO HARD THAT THEY
[ct=3013.764] ROTATE EIGHT OR NINE GUYS.
[ct=3016.272] AL: GOD FOR BID.
[ct=3017.076] KIRK: [LAUGHTER]
[ct=3020.255] AL: FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3025.611] HE FINALLY GIVES STUFFED BEFORE
[ct=3026.732] HE CAN TURN THE CORNER.
[ct=3031.144] KIRK: THE CORNERS IN THIS STYLE
[ct=3032.423] OF DEFENSE, A LOT OF TIMES THEY
[ct=3035.200] WILL SET THE TONE WITH A
[ct=3035.519] WILLINGNESS TO TACKLE.
[ct=3039.550] ECHOLS, HE HAS TO BE ABLE TO
[ct=3042.413] STEP UP AND MAKE A PLAY FOR
[ct=3043.812] REED.
[ct=3046.416] IT LOOKS LIKE ROBERT WOODS WAS
[ct=3048.899] MIXED UP FOR WHO TO BLOCK BUT AT
[ct=3050.214] LEAST THERE WAS A WILLINGNESS
[ct=3051.395] FROM THE CORNER TO COME UP AND
[ct=3052.170] MAKE A PLAY.
[ct=3056.287] AL: THE JETS FINALLY GET THERE
[ct=3058.870] TWO STARTING CORNERS BACK.
[ct=3064.216] FINALLY A LOT OF TIME FOR STROUD
[ct=3067.171] BUT THE SECONDARY DOES ITS WORK.
[ct=3070.815] HE WILL TAKE OFF AND HE WILL GET
[ct=3074.971] THE FIRST DOWN AT THE 14-YARD
[ct=3078.601] ON SECOND AND
[ct=3079.928] FOR THE FIRST.
[ct=3083.550] KIRK: AGAIN, LET'S WATCH THE
[ct=3087.584] HE WILL PULL AND LEAD AND TRY TO
[ct=3087.905] HELP OUT.
[ct=3089.790] TAKES ON REDDICK.
[ct=3093.256] NOW YOU HAVE C.J. STROUD.
[ct=3095.854] THIS IS AN AREA C.J. STROUD
[ct=3097.966] REALLY GREW DURING HIS TIME AT
[ct=3098.599] OHIO STATE.
[ct=3104.289] IN THE SEMI FINAL GAME AGAINST
[ct=3105.968] GEORGIA, HE SHOWED WHAT
[ct=3107.027] DO OUTSIDE THE POCKET.
[ct=3110.716] AL: INSIDE FIVE MINUTES IN THE
[ct=3111.015] HALF.
[ct=3113.955] MIXON GETS STUFFED IN THE
[ct=3117.078] BACKFIELD AND SLOWED DOWN BY
[ct=3117.579] LEONARD TAYLOR.
[ct=3121.063] THE JETS RIGHT NOW WERE ALREADY
[ct=3124.440] MINUS ADAMS, DAVIS, C.J. MOSLEY.
[ct=3129.000] TONIGHT, D.J. REED AND SAUCE
[ct=3129.604] GARDNER BOTH GOT HURT BUT THEY
[ct=3129.912] ARE BACK IN.
[ct=3135.560] KIRK: BOBBY SLOWIK, THE OFFENSE
[ct=3135.560] OF COORDINATOR, HAS TRIED TO
[ct=3138.331] MATCH WITS WITH JEFF ULBRICH.
[ct=3140.418] HE HAS BEEN CHANGING LOOKS.
[ct=3143.890] SOMETIMES HE HAS ONE TIGHT END,
[ct=3145.177] SOMETIMES TWO.
[ct=3147.731] 11 PERSONNEL, SOMETIMES 12.
[ct=3152.228] TWO TIGHT ENDS IS WHAT HE HAS
[ct=3152.487] RIGHT NOW.
[ct=3157.237] AL: THERE HE WAS OUT OF THE
[ct=3157.237] SLOT.
[ct=3163.905] HE HAS TO FLING IT AWAY AS HE
[ct=3164.230] WAS UNDER PRESSURE.
[ct=3167.566] JAVON KINLAW CHASED HIM OUT.
[ct=3175.646] 4:04 TO GO, IT IS THIRD AND 12.
[ct=3175.646] THE GAME REMAINS FOR THIS.
[ct=3179.926] KIRK: THAT TIME, GREAT EFFORT.
[ct=3182.985] WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY LIKE TO
[ct=3184.770] ROTATE AND STAY FRESH BECAUSE OF
[ct=3185.345] HOW HARD THEY PLAY.
[ct=3188.636] IT IS A PENETRATING FRONT THAT
[ct=3189.765] LIKES TO GET INTO THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=3192.436] THEY GET WORN OUT UP FRONT.
[ct=3196.417] TEXANS, THIRD AND 10-PLUS, THEY
[ct=3198.526] ARE THE BEST IN THE LEAGUE IN
[ct=3199.102] CONVERTING THESE THIRD AND
[ct=3199.331] LONGS.
[ct=3202.443] AL: THIRD AND 12.
[ct=3211.156] ON THE MOVE, THROWS, AND THAT IS
[ct=3213.299] CALLED IN, TANK DELL, FOR A
[ct=3217.345] NEEDED 12, PICKED UP 14.
[ct=3220.597] FIRST AND GOAL ON A DRIVE THAT
[ct=3222.842] STARTED BACK ON THEIR OWN 2-YARD
[ct=3226.674] KIRK: A LITTLE STUNT THAT
[ct=3227.176] AFFECTS COMMUNICATION.
[ct=3229.513] HOW ABOUT STROUD?
[ct=3233.743] WHAT WE LOVE ABOUT C.J. STROUD
[ct=3234.936] IS HIS EYES ARE DOWNFIELD WHILE
[ct=3238.227] HE IS RUNNING TO TRY TO BUY TIME
[ct=3239.745] AND THEN THE ACCURACY OF THAT
[ct=3241.200] THROW ON THIRD AND LONG.
[ct=3242.210] ONCE AGAIN, THEY CONVERT.
[ct=3248.382] AL: 14TH PLAY OUT THE DRIVES.
[ct=3250.926] THEY GIVE IT TO MIXON, GOES IN
[ct=3251.524] FOR THE TOUCHDOWN!
[ct=3257.399] IF ANYBODY EVER DESERVED A
[ct=3259.067] TOUCHDOWN AFTER A DRIVE LIKE
[ct=3259.409] THAT, IT IS THAT GUY.
[ct=3264.132] 15 CARRIES TONIGHT, 85 YARDS.
[ct=3268.247] THOMAS MORSTEAD PINS THEN AT THE
[ct=3273.319] 2, AND THEY GO 98 IN 14 PLAYS.
[ct=3278.000] KIRK: QUINCY WILLIAMS SHOT IN,
[ct=3278.943] TRY TO SEE IF HE COULD BLOW THAT
[ct=3279.242] PLAY UP.
[ct=3281.564] MIXON WITH THE JUMP CUT.
[ct=3284.691] ONCE HE GOT AROUND QUINCY
[ct=3285.855] WILLIAMS, THERE WAS NO ONE
[ct=3285.855] THERE.
[ct=3289.209] 98-YARD DRIVE.
[ct=3294.063] AL: TOOK 8:23 OFF THE CLOCK.
[ct=3297.942] KA'IMI FAIRBAIRN TO KICK THE
[ct=3298.294] EXTRA POINT.
[ct=3303.511] 3:21 TO GO IN THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=3308.634] THE HOUSTON TEXANS 7-0 ON
[ct=3309.223] THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL.
[ct=3311.037] REQUEST, HIS BARBER
[ct=3312.320] MOVED FROM COLUMBUS TO HOUSTON
[ct=3313.759] TO KEEP THE ROUTINE GOING.
[ct=3317.137] AND MAGGIE'S CLIENTS CAN BOOK
[ct=3318.410] THE CJ SPECIAL IF THEY LIKE HIS
[ct=3318.612] LOOK.
[ct=3322.006] AL: THE NEXT TIME WE ARE DOWN IN
[ct=3322.634] HOUSTON, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
[ct=3324.845] KIRK: SIGN ME UP.
[ct=3328.554] AL: WE DON'T LOOK GOOD, RIGHT?
[ct=3330.075] KIRK: THAT'S RIGHT.
[ct=3331.483] AL: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
[ct=3334.767] KIRK: WE ALWAYS HAVE A TIGHT CUT
[ct=3335.264] WHEN WE COME IN ON THURSDAY.
[ct=3338.494] AL: THE HAIR ON MY CHEST.
[ct=3340.859] IN OTHER NEWS.
[ct=3347.590] 30 YARD LINE, THE JETS AND
[ct=3347.865] RODGERS GOES BACK TO WORK.
[ct=3352.538] KIRK: HERE WE GO, 3:21, LET'S
[ct=3352.847] SEE IF THE JETS CAN GET ON TH
[ct=3353.188] BOARD.
[ct=3357.150] AL: ROGERS 4-9 FOR 14 YARDS.
[ct=3364.778] BOTH BACKS IN THE BACK.
[ct=3365.074] HALL AND ALLEN.
[ct=3368.462] ALLEN, NUMBER ZERO.
[ct=3373.371] BOTH GOING TO THE PATTERN.
[ct=3374.710] PASS IS CAUGHT.
[ct=3376.079] BREAKING AWAY, PICKING UP THE
[ct=3378.868] SPINNING AWAY THAT TIME IS
[ct=3379.108] DAVANTE ADAMS TO PICK UP
[ct=3383.314] KIRK: GREAT JOB WHERE YOU HAVE A
[ct=3384.512] CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING AFTER THE
[ct=3387.381] PRETTY TIGHT IN THE INTERIOR.
[ct=3388.484] INSIDE LINEBACKER IS LOOKING
[ct=3390.215] RIGHT THERE, BUT HE'S ABLE TO
[ct=3391.116] SHAKE THREE FROM HIM.
[ct=3393.359] HE STILL HAS THAT ABILITY.
[ct=3394.800] YOU ALWAYS THINK ABOUT HIS
[ct=3396.254] RELEASE AT THE LINE OF
[ct=3397.224] SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=3398.092] MAKING PLAYS DOWNFIELD.
[ct=3399.074] THAT TIME DOING IT AFTER THE
[ct=3403.350] AL: THE GROUND, AND NOTHING
[ct=3409.994] TOTO, STOPPING REESE FALLEN HIS
[ct=3410.246] TRACKS.
[ct=3410.854] RUNNING 240.
[ct=3413.026] KIRK: THE GUY WE HAVE NOT SEEN
[ct=3415.115] YET, NOT GETTING THE OPPORTUNITY
[ct=3417.480] IS GARRETT WILSON.
[ct=3418.505] LAST WEEK HE EXPLODED FIVE
[ct=3421.379] CATCHES, 113 YARDS IN THE LOSS
[ct=3422.063] TO NEW ENGLAND.
[ct=3423.805] I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE FELT
[ct=3424.465] WITH THE ATTENTION THAT ADAMS
[ct=3427.373] CAN CREATE, WILSON WILL GET MORE
[ct=3428.715] CLASS -- MORE CHANCES.
[ct=3430.084] IN THE FIRST HALF, JUST THE ONE
[ct=3432.666] TARGET, DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF
[ct=3432.666] YOUR SCREEN.
[ct=3436.366] AL: THE JETS HAD THE BALL FOR A
[ct=3437.213] LITTLE OVER EIGHT MINUTES.
[ct=3440.481] THE PASS OUT HERE, SPEAKING OF
[ct=3444.053] HE GETS INTO THE PLAY, BUT
[ct=3444.793] NOTHING THERE.
[ct=3447.340] LASSITER MAKES THE TACKLE AND
[ct=3448.261] THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE
[ct=3449.409] TWO-MINUTE WARNING. NO, TOO MANY
[ct=3452.304] KIRK: SHE'S NOT LOVING IT.
[ct=3455.015] AL: HALLOWEEN NIGHT.
[ct=3456.834] THE PERFECT NIGHT FOR CANDY
[ct=3457.382] CORN.
[ct=3459.653] COMING BACK WITH A THIRD AND 10
[ct=3462.311] WITH THE JETS FROM THEIR OWN 42
[ct=3467.535] EXTRA PRESSURE.
[ct=3467.535] AND ROGERS IS GOING TO GET
[ct=3469.854] SACKED.
[ct=3471.647] PUT THE HEAT ON AND DOWN HE
[ct=3471.851] GOES.
[ct=3475.122] IT LOOKED LIKE HUNTER WAS THE
[ct=3475.706] FIRST GUIDE TO GET THERE.
[ct=3481.753] 32ND TIMEOUT IS TAKEN HERE BY
[ct=3481.753] NEW YORK.
[ct=3485.305] KIRK: WHAT AN ADDITION DANIEL
[ct=3485.854] HUNTER HAS BEEN.
[ct=3487.025] BOTH OF THESE GUYS.
[ct=3488.326] NOW THAT HE'S BACK.
[ct=3490.694] LOOK AT THAT WIDE STANCE BY
[ct=3490.703] HUNTER.
[ct=3492.212] USUALLY ANDERSON IS ON THE OTHER
[ct=3492.847] SIDE BUT HE GETS ABLE TO GET
[ct=3497.499] AROUND TYRON SMITH AND IT MAKES
[ct=3497.660] HIM STEP UP.
[ct=3499.872] THAT'S WHAT WE’VE SEEN MORE FROM
[ct=3501.330] AARON RODGERS IN RECENT WEEKS.
[ct=3504.705] THE PRESSURE GETS TO HIM AND HE
[ct=3505.398] DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRY
[ct=3508.001] TO FIGHT TO GET OUT OF THERE.
[ct=3509.299] THIS DEFENSIVE LINE REALLY
[ct=3510.911] DIALING UP THAT PRESSURE AND
[ct=3511.459] WINNING THE BATTLE UP FRONT.
[ct=3513.651] AUTRY, TWO SACKS TONIGHT.
[ct=3518.657] AL: TIMEOUT TAKEN BY HOUSTON.
[ct=3519.717] SO THEY HAVE A TON OF TIME.
[ct=3526.538] THEY STILL HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS.
[ct=3527.985] JETS ARE GOING TO GET THE BALL
[ct=3529.155] TO START THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=3535.108] HERE'S MORE SAID, WHOSE LAST
[ct=3536.239] PUNT WAS 75 YARDS.
[ct=3537.074] PINNED HIM INTO TWO BUT THE
[ct=3540.506] TEXAS TOOK IT 98.
[ct=3540.859] THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IN THE
[ct=3541.147] GAME RIGHT NOW.
[ct=3550.416] SHORT, FLOATING KICK.
[ct=3554.342] 29 YARD LINE BY STEVEN SIMS.
[ct=3568.038] AL: SHROUD SIX OUT OF 13 FOR 84
[ct=3568.744] NIXON'S BEEN THE BIG MAN
[ct=3569.832] YOU'VE GOT BLAKE FISHER IN
[ct=3570.797] THEIR.
[ct=3575.056] ROOKIE OUT OF NOTRE DAME UP
[ct=3576.590] FRONT.
[ct=3580.949] PUTTING IT UP FROM THE 32 YARD
[ct=3581.272] LINE SECOND DOWN.
[ct=3585.096] KIRK: HARD RUN GOES RIGHT
[ct=3588.302] THROUGH ISAIAH OLIVER.
[ct=3589.432] NEAR THE END OF THIS RUN.
[ct=3593.342] WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT HIM.
[ct=3594.052] THAT RIGHT SHOULDER WENT RIGHT
[ct=3594.385] TO HIS FACEMASK.
[ct=3600.739] STEFON DIGGS DOWN, YOU WONDER
[ct=3601.973] WHO NOT JUST TONIGHT, MINUTE 20
[ct=3605.118] TO GO, CAN STROUD FIND
[ct=3606.676] TIMING WITH THESE OTHER
[ct=3614.555] AL: MIX AND AGAIN.
[ct=3615.432] DESPITE THAT ANKLE INJURY
[ct=3618.970] CROSSING HIM THREE GAMES PUSH
[ct=3622.184] PART OF ANOTHER, HE'S ON PART OF
[ct=3624.292] A PACE TO RUN FOR OVER 1400 CART
[ct=3624.970] -- 1400 YARDS THIS SEASON.
[ct=3628.096] KIRK: INTERESTING DECISION.
[ct=3629.422] IT'S LIKE NOW HE’S GOING A
[ct=3630.144] LITTLE BIT FASTER.
[ct=3633.742] AL: SAVING THE TWO TIMEOUTS PART
[ct=3634.792] OF THE 50.
[ct=3640.515] DOWN THE SIDELINE, OUT OF BOUNDS
[ct=3643.368] STOPPING THE CLOCK WITH 43
[ct=3643.368] SECONDS, SO HE GETS FREE.
[ct=3647.538] MIXON THREW A NICE BLOCK TO 34
[ct=3652.798] KIRK: WITH HIM COMING FROM THE
[ct=3654.390] LEFT SIDE, HE GETS CAUGHT IN THE
[ct=3654.672] TRAFFIC.
[ct=3655.763] NO ONE HERE TO PICK HIM UP AND
[ct=3656.156] MAN COVERAGE.
[ct=3658.747] THERE'S THE SPEED HE SHOWED LAST
[ct=3660.177] YEAR AS A ROOKIE AFTER THE
[ct=3662.054] REMEMBER HE BROKE HIS LEG AND
[ct=3663.598] WEEK 13 ONE YEAR AGO, HASN'T
[ct=3666.184] QUITE BEEN THE SAME GUY BUT NOW
[ct=3666.844] WITH MORE OPPORTUNITIES.
[ct=3668.158] EVERYONE IS STILL VERY HOPEFUL
[ct=3669.228] HE COULD BECOME THE RECEIVER
[ct=3670.935] THAT HE HAD LAST YEAR WHEN HE
[ct=3671.777] WAS MAKING PLAYS DOWNFIELD.
[ct=3674.661] AL: MIXON PUSHING THE DEFENDER
[ct=3677.017] OUT OF THE WAY,
[ct=3678.645] FOR HIM.
[ct=3686.101] HE'S GOING TO THE END ZONE.
[ct=3688.779] ANOTHER CONTACT.
[ct=3689.699] FIRST TIME HE IS BEEN TARGETED
[ct=3695.215] SECOND AND 10.
[ct=3699.331] KIRK: MUCH BETTER COVERAGE
[ct=3700.076] STAYED ON TOP.
[ct=3702.088] PUTS 95 IN THE MIDDLE.
[ct=3704.710] DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB.
[ct=3705.994] HE'S PLAYING WITH SUCH DIFFERENT
[ct=3709.442] EFFORT AND NOT GETTING TOO LOW
[ct=3710.648] THEY PROTECT THE QUARTERBACK
[ct=3710.906] AFTER THE THROW.
[ct=3731.631] AL: SHROUD, INCOMPLETE.
[ct=3736.115] THE INTENDED RECEIVER, 33 TICKS,
[ct=3741.618] KIRK: JETS WOULD MAN COVERAGE AS
[ct=3741.844] WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THE
[ct=3742.355] DRIVER GOT STARTED.
[ct=3745.037] WHO CAN WIN AGAINST THAT MAN
[ct=3746.913] COVERAGE.
[ct=3749.179] WE SAW HIM ON THAT ROUTE WHERE
[ct=3750.404] HE WAS ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THAT
[ct=3754.061] TRAFFIC TO SPRING FREE, BUT
[ct=3756.279] THESE LAST FEW PLAYS, GOOD
[ct=3756.908] COVERAGE BY THE JETS AGAINST
[ct=3757.123] THESE RECEIVERS.
[ct=3763.037] AL: LONG TIME ASSISTANT COACH,
[ct=3763.686] MIKE SHANAHAN FOR A NUMBER OF
[ct=3770.845] THIRD DOWN AND 10.
[ct=3772.197] HANGING IN THE POCKET.
[ct=3777.459] DOWN HE GOES, A BIG SACK, TAKING
[ct=3778.221] DEEPER INTO THE FIELD GOAL
[ct=3778.221] TERRITORY.
[ct=3784.165] MEANWHILE, NOW YOU'VE GOT
[ct=3790.654] STROUD'S DOWN WITH 26 SECONDS OH
[ct=3791.943] BABY.
[ct=3797.777] KIRK: WITH THE EDGE PRESSURE
[ct=3800.201] WITH REDDICK AND MCDONNELL, IT
[ct=3801.098] MAKES THEIR QUARTERBACK WANT TO
[ct=3801.284] STEP UP.
[ct=3802.618] IF YOU GET A PUSH IN THE MIDDLE
[ct=3805.611] FROM THOMAS, THAT'S HOW YOU GET
[ct=3806.431] SACKS IN THE INTERIOR WITH THAT
[ct=3812.787] >> THIS OCCURRED BEFORE THE
[ct=3813.781] TIMEOUT.
[ct=3815.180] PLEASE RESET THE GAME CLOCK TO
[ct=3815.583] 37 SECONDS.
[ct=3821.970] AL: THE CLOCK GOES TO 27.
[ct=3823.088] THE BACKUP QUARTERBACK WOULD BE
[ct=3824.831] DAVIS MILLS.
[ct=3830.784] KIRK: I TALKED TO CJ ON THE
[ct=3832.511] FIELD, HOW YOU FEELING, SHORT
[ct=3832.687] WEEK.
[ct=3836.444] KIND OF BANGED UP RIGHT NOW AND
[ct=3837.081] HE'S FIGHTING LIKE A LOT OF
[ct=3837.258] GUYS.
[ct=3843.003] THEY CAPABLE BACK UP WITH A
[ct=3845.428] STARTER A COUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE
[ct=3846.195] CJ WAS DRAFTED.
[ct=3847.849] JUST GOOD TO SEE HIM UP AND
[ct=3848.304] WALKING OFF.
[ct=3855.789] AL: TAKING THE HALFTIME BREAK TO
[ct=3856.465] GET WHATEVER TREATMENT IS THERE.
[ct=3868.378] MEANWHILE, FAIRBAIRN IS GOING
[ct=3869.746] INTO THE GAME.
[ct=3874.540] THAT'S A 15 YARD PENALTY IF THEY
[ct=3876.780] WOULD'VE CAUGHT THAT.
[ct=3878.979] BUT THEY DIDN'T, SO INSTEAD NOW
[ct=3879.127] YOU’
[ct=3880.618] YOU'VE GOT A 56 YARD FIELD GOAL
[ct=3888.643] ATTEMPT FOR FAIRBAIRN NINE FOR
[ct=3893.560] 10 THIS SEASON.
[ct=3894.342] IN HIS RANGE.
[ct=3896.714] THE DISTANCE BUT NOT THE
[ct=3898.008] ACCURACY.
[ct=3902.601] JETS WILL TAKE WHATEVER BREAK
[ct=3903.722] THEY CAN GET.
[ct=3912.611] KIRK: THE OPERATION IS CLEAN,
[ct=3912.840] GOOD SNAP.
[ct=3916.020] HE JUST PUSHES IT HOW YOU SAID,
[ct=3916.484] HE HAD THE DISTANCE.
[ct=3919.915] AARON RODGERS AND HIS ENTIRE
[ct=3921.492] CAREER, THE FEWEST YARDS IN THE
[ct=3923.918] FIRST HALF.
[ct=3924.087] WHERE HE’
[ct=3924.781] WHERE HE'S ATTEMPTED AT LEAST 10
[ct=3925.542] PASSES.
[ct=3926.585] 27 YARDS PASSING.
[ct=3930.590] PREVIOUS LOW WAS 37.
[ct=3933.939] AL: 12 OF THEM ON ONE PASS TO
[ct=3940.473] SO NOW THE JETS, ROGERS, HE'S
[ct=3942.760] CAPABLE, OBVIOUSLY THE KING OF
[ct=3943.658] THE HAIL MARY, WHAT'S HE GOING
[ct=3945.405] TO DO HERE, TRIES TO GET A
[ct=3947.791] LITTLE CLOSER, HE WILL STOP THE
[ct=3948.789] CLOCK AND IT GETS ADAMS THERE.
[ct=3951.252] EVERYTHING HAS BEEN PRETTY SHORT
[ct=3956.480] KIRK: THEY HAD FIELD GOAL
[ct=3958.482] KICKING ISSUES, OBVIOUSLY WHAT'S
[ct=3959.222] WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN RECENT
[ct=3959.448] WEEKS.
[ct=3963.005] AL: THEY CERTAINLY DO.
[ct=3965.086] NOW YOU HAVE PATTERSON WHO WAS
[ct=3965.491] JUST SIGNED.
[ct=3966.957] HE'S BEEN AROUND.
[ct=3968.333] JOURNEYMAN TICKER.
[ct=3976.711] HE'S HURT AND PATTERSON, FOURTH
[ct=3977.862] YEAR IN THE LEAGUE, TRADE A
[ct=3978.199] COUPLE OF TIMES.
[ct=3981.974] JACKSONVILLE, CLEVELAND.
[ct=3983.026] SEE IF HE GETS A SHOT.
[ct=3986.323] THAT IS GOING TO NOT HOLD IN.
[ct=3990.359] ADAMS WAS THERE, HAD TO REACH
[ct=3991.224] DOWN FOR IT.
[ct=3991.670] COVERING ON THE PLAY.
[ct=3994.738] ROGERS LOOKS AT THE HEAVENS
[ct=3994.956] DURING THE BY.
[ct=4001.235] KIRK: WHAT A MATCH UP WITH
[ct=4005.004] BALLS THERE, JUST UNABLE TO HOLD
[ct=4005.004] ONTO IT.
[ct=4006.940] GETS BOTH HANDS ON IT.
[ct=4008.932] IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S A SHORT
[ct=4010.271] CATCH FOR A GUY LIKE DAVANTE
[ct=4013.090] PUT THEM IN GREAT FIELD GOAL
[ct=4015.514] RANGE AT THE VERY LEAST.
[ct=4015.514] BUT, IN INCOMPLETION.
[ct=4022.086] AL: HE'S PROBABLY THINKING I’VE
[ct=4023.250] GOT TO GET BACK TO PERU.
[ct=4024.302] THIRD AND FIVE.
[ct=4030.155] IN THAT'S BROKEN UP.
[ct=4034.397] IT ADAMS, THE INTENDED RECEIVER
[ct=4036.218] AGAIN, BROKEN UP HERE, 12
[ct=4040.101] KIRK: IT SHOWS YOU THE
[ct=4041.797] CONFIDENCE DEMECO RYANS HAS WITH
[ct=4042.480] THE CORNERS.
[ct=4043.496] HE PUTS THEM OUT THERE ON
[ct=4043.496] IOWANS.
[ct=4046.700] BELIEVE HE CAN WIN THAT ONE ON
[ct=4046.984] ONE MATCH UP.
[ct=4048.501] ADAMS WON THE LAST ONE.
[ct=4048.957] WATCH THAT.
[ct=4052.440] GREAT RECOGNITION, BALLS OUT IN
[ct=4054.255] THAT RIGHT ARM COMES DOWN TO
[ct=4054.557] KNOCK THAT BALL AWAY.
[ct=4063.663] AL: JETS CAN'T TAKE A CHANCE ON
[ct=4065.066] GOING FOR IT BECAUSE ON FOURTH
[ct=4068.290] DOWN THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT, ONE
[ct=4069.029] PASS IN TEXAS MIGHT BE IN FIELD
[ct=4069.428] SHAPE AGAIN.
[ct=4075.412] SO MOORE SAID COMES INTO NT.
[ct=4076.192] PUNT NUMBER FIVE FOR HIM.
[ct=4078.006] WE'VE GOT A FLAG.
[ct=4083.208] NO BIG DEAL HERE WITH THE BALL
[ct=4083.473] TO MIDFIELD.
[ct=4089.339] THE INTERIM COACH, AGAIN, IT'S
[ct=4091.977] INTERESTING BECAUSE HE WAS THE
[ct=4094.327] DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR AND
[ct=4096.680] INSTEAD OF HANDING OFF THAT
[ct=4097.766] ROLE, HE'S TRYING TO DO TWO
[ct=4100.032] THINGS AT ONCE, HIS FIRST HEAD
[ct=4100.416] COACHING OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=4103.365] MIDDLE OF THE SEASON IS TOUGH.
[ct=4105.599] SO FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=4114.677] ONE IN TO THE END ZONE WITH FIVE
[ct=4116.488] SECONDS LEFT.
[ct=4121.655] A NONPARTISAN INITIATIVE THAT
[ct=4124.176] SUPPORTS CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AMONG
[ct=4124.363] NFL FAMILIES.
[ct=4127.516] FOR MORE INFORMATION, MAKE YOUR
[ct=4129.074] GAME PLAN FOR THE UPCOMING
[ct=4131.151] ELECTION, PLEASE VISIT
[ct=4133.975] INTEL.COM/VOTES.

[ct=4136.863] GAME, THERE HE IS, JOE MIXON.
[ct=4142.236] MEANWHILE, SHROUD IS BACK.
[ct=4142.971] THAT'S REALLY GOOD NEWS.
[ct=4146.376] HE WILL TAKE JUST A KNEE.
[ct=4152.174] A VERY FAMILIAR SOUND IN THE
[ct=4153.504] MEADOWLANDS BOTH FOR THE JETS
[ct=4153.819] AND THE GIANTS.
[ct=4156.459] KAYLEE, TO YOU.
[ct=4157.902] >>ES,
[ct=4159.225] 100 OR MORE RUSHING YARDS IN THE
[ct=4162.588] FIRST HALF, THANK YOU JOE MIXON.
[ct=4165.390] AND FOR AARON RODGERS, SEVEN OUT
[ct=4168.436] OF 14 32 YARDS.
[ct=4172.879] NO TRUTH TO THE RUMORS THAT IN
[ct=4174.272] THE JETS LOCKER ROOM AT HALFTIME
[ct=4175.397] THEY WERE PLAYING HELLO DARKNESS
[ct=4175.624] MY OLD FRIEND.
[ct=4178.854] FAKE NEWS.
[ct=4183.551] KIRK: THAT WAS A TOUGH HALF.
[ct=4185.093] AL: VERY.
[ct=4188.327] KIRK: IT'S GOING TO GET A LOT
[ct=4189.398] BETTER HERE.
[ct=4189.835] A BETTER EXECUTION.
[ct=4192.351] AL: PROMISE?
[ct=4197.837] AL: JETS START AT THE 30 AND WE
[ct=4198.151] GO TO KAYLEE.
[ct=4201.654] >> YOUR OFFENSE IF STRUGGLES
[ct=4202.386] CONTINUE, WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO
[ct=4204.316] GET IT ON THE BOARD?
[ct=4208.322] >> WEATHER PENALTIES,
[ct=4209.184] EXECUTIONS, YOU HAVE TO CLEAN IT
[ct=4210.193] UP AND WE WILL GET AFTER THESE
[ct=4214.195] KAYLEE: A MENTAL MISTAKE BY
[ct=4215.323] MALACHI ON THE COLTS -- GOAL
[ct=4216.535] LINE, HOW IS THAT A AT HALFTIME?
[ct=4219.721] >> HE WILL LEARN FROM THAT AND
[ct=4220.765] GROW FROM THAT AND I HAVE A
[ct=4221.444] FEELING HE WILL MAKE UP FOR A.
[ct=4227.243] AL: THANK YOU, KAYLEE.
[ct=4228.502] HE DROPPED IT BEFORE HE WENT
[ct=4228.915] INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=4238.791] START WITH REESE, UP TO THE 35.
[ct=4240.407] SECOND DOWN AND FIVE.
[ct=4246.075] KIRK: HIS ANSWER GIVES YOU AN
[ct=4247.164] IDEA OF WHY AARON RODGERS ON
[ct=4249.781] THESE JETS PLAYERS ARE IN AN
[ct=4251.114] AWKWARD, WEIRD SITUATION WHEN
[ct=4252.400] YOU LOSE YOUR HEAD COACH EARLY
[ct=4256.054] IN THE YEAR, THEY SAID HE HAS
[ct=4256.417] BEEN A ROCK.
[ct=4256.619] WE LIKE HIM.
[ct=4263.160] HE HAS DONE THE BEST THAT HE CAN
[ct=4265.370] UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT
[ct=4267.175] EVEN THAT ANSWER, HE WILL MAKE
[ct=4268.355] UP FOR IT IN THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=4272.076] TRYING TO FIND POSITIVITY, WHICH
[ct=4272.242] IS TOUGH TO DO.
[ct=4277.370] AL: COMING UP CLOSE TO A FIRST
[ct=4277.725] DOWN HERE.
[ct=4280.921] IN A MARKET JUST SHY THIRD DOWN.
[ct=4285.548] KIRK: IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO
[ct=4288.473] SEE WHAT THE OFFENSE OF STAFF
[ct=4290.572] DOES TRYING TO GET THIS UP AND
[ct=4292.124] GOING, RODGERS BEING ABLE TO RUN
[ct=4293.554] THE BALL IN THE YOU HAVE TO BE
[ct=4294.187] ABLE TO WIN DOWNFIELD.
[ct=4315.377] AL: ALLEN, UP TO THE 43.
[ct=4323.140] SELDOMLY USED IN THE LAST COUPLE
[ct=4323.346] OF GAMES.
[ct=4328.739] KIRK: REALLY A GOOD EFFORT, IT
[ct=4329.714] LOOK LIKE IT'S NOT GOING
[ct=4329.983] ANYWHERE.
[ct=4333.373] FAST FLOWING DEFENSE TO GO OUT
[ct=4336.855] ON THE EDGE AND SOLVE IT, THEY
[ct=4339.365] WERE ABLE TO CUT IT BACK AND GET
[ct=4342.052] POSITIVE YARDS.
[ct=4342.683] THEY WERE ON THE GROUND TO START
[ct=4344.714] THINGS OFF.
[ct=4346.657] THEY GO TO THE BOTTOM.
[ct=4356.603] AL: ALLEN, A NICE AND A ONE-TWO
[ct=4359.947] PUNCH, BUT IT'S BEEN TAKING OVER
[ct=4361.528] MOST OF THE DUTIES OF LATE.
[ct=4364.279] KIRK: KIRK: HE HAS A HANDFUL --
[ct=4367.218] KIRK: HE IS A HANDFUL.
[ct=4368.673] WE TALKED ABOUT IT WEEK THREE, I
[ct=4370.597] WATCHED THEM PLAY QUITE A BIT
[ct=4375.005] JUST QUITE A BIT -- QUITE A BIT.
[ct=4380.048] AS YOU SAY, NICE TANDEM, VERY
[ct=4382.227] DIFFERENT STYLE WITH HIM AT
[ct=4382.227] HOME.
[ct=4386.154] AL: 20 YEARS OLD, YOUNGEST
[ct=4387.480] PLAYER IN THE NFL RIGHT NOW.
[ct=4391.300] SECOND DOWN AND 5.
[ct=4392.499] QUICK TOSS HERE.
[ct=4394.386] THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=4396.869] HE SWINGS THEM OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=4401.582] NO FLAG ON THE PLAY AFTER THAT.
[ct=4405.059] KIRK: THEY RUN IT FOUR STRAIGHT
[ct=4405.318] TIMES.
[ct=4406.062] THIS IS ANOTHER RUN.
[ct=4409.725] HE'S GOT A QUICK THROW OUT
[ct=4411.580] YOU GOT THE BLOCK AROUND IN
[ct=4412.224] FRONT, YOU TAKE IT.
[ct=4416.650] AN EASY JOB TO BE ABLE TO PICK
[ct=4417.608] UP FIRST DOWN YARDAGE.
[ct=4418.679] HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU SEEN
[ct=4421.872] THEM DO THAT WITH THE CORNER.
[ct=4423.645] HAS THAT TAG ON THE RUN, BEEN
[ct=4425.224] ABLE TO FLIP IT OUT THERE.
[ct=4429.587] AL: BACK TO BACK, THEY HAVE ONLY
[ct=4430.365] SEVEN IN THE GAME.
[ct=4433.312] EXTRA MAN COMES, ROGERS MOVING.
[ct=4433.925] ROGERS HIT PRETTY HIGH.
[ct=4440.866] AARON PASSED SECOND DOWN AND 10.
[ct=4446.123] KIRK: AARON RODGERS EARLY IN THE
[ct=4447.852] AIR WAS MOVING AROUND PRETTY
[ct=4448.473] WELL COMING OFF THAT ACHILLES.
[ct=4452.350] HE HAS NOT MOVED AROUND AS MUCH.
[ct=4452.350] THAT’
[ct=4453.679] THAT'S SCARY ANY TIME LET ALONE
[ct=4456.507] YOUR COMING OFF AN ACHILLES
[ct=4457.493] INJURY THAT HE HAD ONE YEAR AGO.
[ct=4465.384] AL: BRACE HIMSELF.
[ct=4469.668] THE 45.
[ct=4479.251] PLAY FAKE, ADAMS, AND ADAMS GOES
[ct=4479.680] THIS WAY FOR A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4483.778] BACK TO BACK TO BACK FIRST DOWN
[ct=4484.791] FOR THE JETS TO START THE SECOND
[ct=4489.113] KIRK: A GREAT JOB BY AARON
[ct=4489.660] RODGERS, SENSING AND FEELING.
[ct=4490.804] HE’
[ct=4492.276] HE'S GOT A RUN PLAY HERE.
[ct=4494.463] BUT SEE THAT PLAY, FLIPS IT OUT
[ct=4496.378] THERE BECAUSE THE SAFETY IS SO
[ct=4500.964] DEEP SO THE ROOKIE WAS BACK,
[ct=4502.179] SEES HIS BLITZ AND SAYS, WE ARE
[ct=4502.701] NOT GOING TO RUN THIS.
[ct=4505.660] FLIPPING OUT TO ADAMS.
[ct=4507.056] SECOND TIME HE HAS DONE THAT.
[ct=4510.421] REALLY GOOD COMBINATION, RUNNING
[ct=4513.111] THE FOOTBALL, BEING PATIENT AND
[ct=4513.897] ROGERS RECOGNIZES THE PASS.
[ct=4519.797] AL: CLOSES IN A HURRY, 25 YARD
[ct=4520.523] WE GO TO KAYLEE.
[ct=4525.268] KAYLEE: THE JETS START MAKING
[ct=4525.753] HEADWAY ON OFFENSE WITHOUT
[ct=4528.218] DEFENSIVE END WEILL ANDERSON.
[ct=4529.830] RESOLVE TO THE FIRST HALF TRYING
[ct=4530.886] TO FIGHT THROUGH AN ANKLE INJURY
[ct=4533.810] BUT HE HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED TO
[ct=4533.810] QUESTIONABLE.
[ct=4535.102] WHEN THE TEXANS OFFENSE GETS
[ct=4536.004] BACK ON THE FIELD, THEY WILL NOT
[ct=4539.260] HAVE LEFT GUARD, HE HAS BEEN
[ct=4539.596] RULED OUT.
[ct=4543.457] AL: ANDERSON HAS BEEN IN AND OUT
[ct=4544.683] SINCE HE WENT INTO THE BLUE
[ct=4547.277] OUT RIGHT NOW, SECOND DOWN AND
[ct=4547.277] THREE.
[ct=4553.077] ROGERS THROWS, IT IN THE TRAFFIC
[ct=4553.077] CAUGHT.
[ct=4553.697] THAT'S A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4557.079] MIKE WILLIAMS HAS HAD A LOT OF
[ct=4558.432] GOOD YEARS WITH THE CHARGERS,
[ct=4559.392] COMES OVER AND HASN'T DONE MUCH
[ct=4561.410] PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4568.286] KIRK: THAT WAS A TIGHT WINDOW
[ct=4569.453] AND HE MAKES AN ACCURATE THROW
[ct=4571.295] TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE WITH THE
[ct=4571.549] LINEBACKERS.
[ct=4573.782] IT’
[ct=4576.265] IT'S THE 10TH PLAY THIS DRIVE.
[ct=4577.118] GRAPE PATIENT SO FAR BY ROGERS
[ct=4577.493] AND THE JETS.
[ct=4582.140] AL: FIVE RUNS, FOUR PASSES.
[ct=4594.736] GOOD TACKLE RIGHT IN THE BACK.
[ct=4598.163] RESOLVE TAKING DOWN TIM, COMES
[ct=4599.560] DIVING INTO STOP HIM.
[ct=4602.635] SECOND DOWN AND 12 AFTER A LOSS
[ct=4602.958] OF TWO YARDS.
[ct=4607.368] KIRK: WHAT A YEAR HE HAS HAD
[ct=4609.052] COMING FROM BUFFALO, NOT ONLY
[ct=4609.475] THE ABILITY TO BUY INTO THE
[ct=4609.978] SYSTEM AND SACKS.
[ct=4613.544] GOT FOUR INTO TONIGHT PUT A LOT
[ct=4615.101] OF ABILITY TO MAKE PLAYS LIKE
[ct=4615.702] THAT.
[ct=4616.325] GETTING THAT DEFENSE IS
[ct=4616.634] PREDICATED UPON.
[ct=4620.310] THAT DEFENSE OF LINE IS GETTING
[ct=4621.464] UPFIELD, BEING DISRUPTIVE.
[ct=4622.912] YOU SEE 96 AUTRY WHO COULD PLAY
[ct=4626.359] INSIDE BUT WITH THE INTEREST --
[ct=4627.462] INJURY, ANDERSON IS PUSHED
[ct=4627.462] OUTSIDE.
[ct=4632.132] AL: SECOND AND 12, WHAT --
[ct=4635.487] ROGERS UNDER PRESSURE,
[ct=4636.875] ONE-HANDED CAUGHT.
[ct=4637.181] WILSON, TOUCHDOWN!
[ct=4638.136] NOBODY THERE.
[ct=4638.316] GOOD BALL PLACEMENT.
[ct=4642.806] AL: RILEY PASSES FIRST KICK AS A
[ct=4643.041] JET.
[ct=4651.204] AL: FROM THE TWO YARD LINE,
[ct=4652.239] STEVEN SIMS.
[ct=4658.866] 29 AND A PENALTY.
[ct=4677.498] >> DURING THE RETURN, PERSONAL
[ct=4678.907] FOUL, FACEMASK BY THE KICKING
[ct=4679.739] TEAM NUMBER 88.
[ct=4680.580] IT'S FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4685.796] AL: WE TALKED ABOUT THE JETS
[ct=4685.796] PLENTY TONIGHT.
[ct=4690.943] THEY FINALLY GOT IT RIGHT, HE
[ct=4691.616] WAS THERE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS
[ct=4692.994] AND THEN HE TOOK OVER THE MIDDLE
[ct=4693.739] OF THE SEASON.
[ct=4697.271] THEY HAD LOVIE SMITH.
[ct=4697.761] I THINK THEY REALLY GOT IT
[ct=4698.705] RIGHT.
[ct=4703.586] KIRK: I THINK HE RELATES TO THE
[ct=4705.656] PLAYERS IN A WAY THAT VERY FEW
[ct=4706.138] GUYS CAN.
[ct=4708.599] LOOK AT WHAT HE DID AS A PLAYER.
[ct=4710.011] HE HAS RESPECT THERE.
[ct=4711.612] HE PAID HIS DUES AND BECAME A
[ct=4712.021] COORDINATOR.
[ct=4715.070] HE HAS AN INFECTIOUS ATTITUDE
[ct=4715.715] AND ENERGY ABOUT HIM.
[ct=4718.933] AL: SHROUD.
[ct=4719.536] LET'S TAKE IT UP AT THE END OF
[ct=4727.360] WITH RYAN'S, HE WAS WITH THE
[ct=4727.360] TEXANS, SO HE KNOWS THE
[ct=4729.183] ORGANIZATION.
[ct=4729.836] HE GOES TO PHILADELPHIA AND
[ct=4733.097] SAYS, HIS FIRST YEAR IN PHILLY
[ct=4734.838] WAS AND HE READS.
[ct=4736.124] TOOK A LOT OF WIN FOR ANDY REID
[ct=4736.905] WHILE HE'S AROUND THE FOOTBALL
[ct=4737.222] TEAM.
[ct=4741.178] KIRK: AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO GO
[ct=4742.439] OUT OBVIOUSLY WITH SAN FRANCISCO
[ct=4742.875] AND WATCH AND LEARN FROM SOME OF
[ct=4746.375] THE BEST AND THEN HE GETS HIS
[ct=4748.579] I THINK WHEN HE HAS DONE A
[ct=4749.272] THAT'S WHAT HE HAS DONE A NICE
[ct=4751.058] JOB OF IT AS HE HAS TAKEN ALL OF
[ct=4753.313] THAT AND HE HAS BEEN TRUE TO
[ct=4753.520] HIMSELF AND WHO HE IS.
[ct=4755.347] THE FIRST YEAR HE CHANGE THAT
[ct=4757.851] CULTURE IN HOUSTON AND GOT SOME
[ct=4758.510] YOUNG PLAYERS.
[ct=4759.873] THEY ARE A TEAM ON THE GO RIGHT
[ct=4759.873] NOW.
[ct=4766.590] AL: CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN GOES
[ct=4766.590] JOE MIXON.
[ct=4767.035] BACK OVER THE KAYLEE.
[ct=4771.945] KAYLEE: YOU WON'T FIND ANYBODY
[ct=4772.176] DOZING OFF IN A D'AMICO RYAN
[ct=4774.581] LEAD MEETING.
[ct=4776.613] HE TOLD ME HE'S SO ENERGETIC
[ct=4777.648] HE'S GOT A PARTY SCREAMING ALL
[ct=4777.951] NIGHT.
[ct=4781.562] AL: YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT IF YOU
[ct=4784.430] TALK TO HIM AWAY FROM THAT
[ct=4784.430] ENVIRONMENT.
[ct=4785.036] SHROUD RUNS FOR A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4790.667] KIRK: MAN-TO-MAN COVERAGE, NOT
[ct=4791.602] EXPECTING C.J. STROUD TO HOLD
[ct=4793.014] ONTO THAT BALL AND SHORT
[ct=4793.639] YARDAGE.
[ct=4795.714] GOOD CALL TO GET HIM OUT ON THE
[ct=4795.714] EDGE.
[ct=4796.508] NOBODY ACCOUNTS FOR HIM.
[ct=4802.700] TODD TOWNIE -- TODD DOWNING
[ct=4804.506] THEY ARE EXPECTING JOE MIXON TO
[ct=4805.764] RUN INTO THE MIDDLE.
[ct=4807.468] THAT'S FOR ALL THE DEFENDERS
[ct=4807.833] WERE.
[ct=4808.418] YOU COULD SEE SHERWOOD HAS HIS
[ct=4809.014] BACK TURNED.
[ct=4812.154] NOBODY HAS EXPECTED SHROUD TO
[ct=4812.597] RUN.
[ct=4813.631] GOOD CALL UTILIZING HIS LEGS.
[ct=4817.329] AL: JJ IS NOW A RUNNING BACK.
[ct=4819.984] FOR A COUPLE OF PLACE TONIGHT.
[ct=4823.580] YOU CALL THIS NUMBER AND THEN HE
[ct=4824.504] TRIPS AND FALLS.
[ct=4826.228] MIGHT'VE PICKED UP A FEW MORE,
[ct=4829.538] MIGHT'VE HAD A FEW, HE GOES
[ct=4830.227] THANKS TO THE TURP.
[ct=4835.417] KIRK: THE JOB THAT KENDRICK
[ct=4836.875] GREEN HAS DONE, WHO HAS REALLY
[ct=4840.656] STRUGGLED IN THE FIRST HALF, 53
[ct=4841.857] HOLDING HIS OWN.
[ct=4844.386] DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB.
[ct=4844.386] WHETHER IT’
[ct=4845.681] WHETHER IT'S BEEN RUN OR PASS,
[ct=4846.583] MOVING THEM AROUND QUITE A BIT
[ct=4849.695] AS WELL, BUT THAT OFFENSE OF
[ct=4850.879] LINE AND THAT FIRST HALF, THEY
[ct=4855.280] WERE VERY -- DEALING WITH A LOT
[ct=4857.029] OF AGGRESSIVE APPROACH BY THE
[ct=4857.029] JETS.
[ct=4857.996] THE JETS WERE VERY DISRUPTIVE
[ct=4860.507] BUT THEY DID SLOW DOWN A BIT
[ct=4861.464] WITH 53 DOWN ON THE LEFT SIDE.
[ct=4868.891] AL: SECOND AND 1.
[ct=4870.622] GIVE IT TO TAYLOR AGAIN.
[ct=4871.920] HE PICKS UP A FIRST DOWN ON THE
[ct=4872.253] 24 YARD LINE.
[ct=4876.211] GOOD OPENING DRIVES.
[ct=4877.146] NOTHING MAJOR.
[ct=4877.931] GOOD OPENING DRIVES FOR BOTH
[ct=4878.264] TEAMS.
[ct=4884.410] KIRK: RIGHT ON CUE 53 GREEN WITH
[ct=4884.717] THE BLOCK.
[ct=4888.859] LOOKING FOR A LITTLE EXTRA
[ct=4888.859] EFFORT 10 YARDS DOWNFIELD.
[ct=4895.514] PRETTY GOOD ANSWER BY HOUSTON
[ct=4896.154] AFTER THAT IMPRESSIVE OPENING
[ct=4897.724] DRIVE BY THE JETS.
[ct=4899.045] COMING RIGHT BACK DOWN DEEP INTO
[ct=4899.643] THE JETS TERRITORY.
[ct=4906.995] AL: ON THIS THEY HAVE ALL BEEN
[ct=4906.995] RUNS.
[ct=4907.865] MIX IN APPROACHING 100 YARDS.
[ct=4915.202] PLAY-ACTION, PASS, NOT HOLDING.
[ct=4916.926] HE COULD NOT HAUL IT IN.
[ct=4921.247] MAKES IT SECOND DOWN AND 10.
[ct=4922.543] SHROUD IS SEVEN FOR 17 AND 15
[ct=4926.483] KIRK: HE'S REALLY FRUSTRATED
[ct=4927.896] BECAUSE THAT WAS A FIRST AND 10
[ct=4928.229] REACTION.
[ct=4929.822] THEY BOOTED HIM BACK TO THE
[ct=4931.985] HE ACTUALLY HAD AN OPEN
[ct=4934.285] HE DID A NICE JOB OF MAKING A
[ct=4934.987] QUICK READ.
[ct=4937.471] GETS IT OUT OF HIS HAND.
[ct=4939.839] THAT'S A BALL ACTIVITY SHROUD
[ct=4940.500] HAS SHOWN CONSISTENTLY TO BE
[ct=4941.686] ABLE TO MAKE THAT
[ct=4943.404] THROW.
[ct=4945.963] THAT'S BIG YARDS ON FIRST AND 10
[ct=4948.865] , IF THEY HAD THAT ONE.
[ct=4957.544] AL: STUFFED IN THE BACKFIELD, NO
[ct=4957.833] GAIN.
[ct=4963.033] JAVON KINLAW ON, SEVERAL SEASONS
[ct=4965.787] WITH THE --
[ct=4969.112] KIRK: HE'S PLAYING A LOT BETTER
[ct=4970.473] THAN HE HAS RECENTLY WHERE HE
[ct=4971.751] HAS HAD SOME STRUGGLES WHERE HE
[ct=4975.355] GETS UP HIGH AGAINST THE RUN AND
[ct=4976.083] HE GETS PUSHED OFF THE LINE OF
[ct=4979.066] TONIGHT, HE MUST LIKE THE
[ct=4982.174] MATCHUP BECAUSE HE IS MOVING
[ct=4982.715] AROUND MUCH BETTER.
[ct=4983.720] HE SHOOTING THE GAPS AGAINST HIS
[ct=4987.517] OFFENSIVE LINE AND GETTING INTO
[ct=4988.815] THAT BACKFIELD, WHETHER IT'S
[ct=4989.392] BEEN A PASS RUSHER A PASS RUSHER
[ct=4989.557] GETS THE RUN.
[ct=4995.886] AL: WHEN HE'S IN THE BACKFIELD
[ct=4996.628] UP THIRD AND 11.
[ct=5000.031] HE STAYS IN THE BLOCK.
[ct=5001.726] THERE HE GOES.
[ct=5005.970] YOU HAD MCDONNELL COMING IN
[ct=5008.169] FIRST AND THEN SHERWOOD FINISHES
[ct=5010.582] HIM OFF.
[ct=5013.243] THAT'S A SACK OF 11 YARDS FROM
[ct=5016.644] MCDONALD WHO'S HAD SUCH A BIG
[ct=5017.734] YEAR COMING IN A SACKS ON THE
[ct=5021.938] YEAR, HE WORKS AROUND TONSIL
[ct=5022.560] WITH QUICKNESS.
[ct=5023.930] I THOUGHT HE WOULD PULL HIM DOWN
[ct=5026.037] WITH ONE ARM, BUT INSTEAD HE
[ct=5027.522] FORCED HIM TO STEP UP.
[ct=5028.667] THERE SHERWOOD THAT JUST CLEANED
[ct=5029.119] SET UP AT THE END.
[ct=5032.152] AL: YOU WILL COME IN.
[ct=5035.945] HE MISSED A 56 YARDER EARLIER,
[ct=5037.218] HAD THE DISTANCE, BUT IT WAS
[ct=5037.218] WIDE.
[ct=5041.888] THIS WAS 54 OUT.
[ct=5044.649] ON ITS WAY, AND THROUGH.
[ct=5049.693] AL: NO QUESTION.
[ct=5052.229] THE GIANTS AND FOR HOME GAMES
[ct=5052.954] THIS YEAR, WHEN TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=5059.288] KIRK: IT WAS A TOUGH FIRST HALF
[ct=5060.713] OF THE JETS OFFENSE.
[ct=5063.365] THEY RESPONDED PERFECTLY WITH
[ct=5063.365] THE ADJUSTMENTS.
[ct=5065.178] THINGS LOOKED A LOT BETTER BUT
[ct=5065.883] IT CANNOT HAVE GONE ANY WORSE.
[ct=5067.704] EVEN WHEN THEY PLAY WELL, THE
[ct=5069.312] DEFENSE WITH THE CHANCE TO STOP
[ct=5072.549] ON A PUNT, THERE'S THE POMMEL
[ct=5073.923] FOR T END ZONE WITH A TOUCH
[ct=5076.678] DROP PASSES.
[ct=5077.400] JUST OUT OF SYNC.
[ct=5078.918] WHEN THEY HAD OVER RECEIVERS
[ct=5081.372] DROP ALSO, A LITTLE BIT OF
[ct=5081.705] EVERYTHING.
[ct=5082.848] MUCH OF WHAT YOU SEEN THE FIRST
[ct=5085.702] EIGHT WEEKS OF THE SEASON, BUT
[ct=5087.610] THE OUTSTANDING START TO THE
[ct=5088.662] SECOND HALF OF THE PATIENT
[ct=5091.519] APPROACH, AARON RODGERS RUN GAME
[ct=5092.547] MIXED IN WITH SOME QUICK THROWS.
[ct=5098.237] AL: THIS ONE, PLAY-ACTION,
[ct=5098.538] ROLLING, THROWING.
[ct=5100.613] INTENDED.
[ct=5101.146] THIS HAS BEEN A HOUSE OF
[ct=5101.539] HORRORS.
[ct=5105.102] DON'T FORGET, HOPE -- GHOSTS
[ct=5105.822] HAVE APPEARED HERE.
[ct=5111.490] SAM ARNOLD SAW SOME IN THAT PACE
[ct=5111.490] AGAINST THE PATRIOTS.
[ct=5122.906] KIRK: I'VE BEEN IN A BOOTH ON
[ct=5123.234] HALLOWEEN.
[ct=5123.634] I'M LOOKING AROUND.
[ct=5126.245] AL: YOU NEVER KNOW.
[ct=5130.057] YOU DON'T USE, THESE ARE JEWS.
[ct=5138.400] A TACKLE, AND ANOTHER.
[ct=5138.400] IN PICKS UP A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5140.979] AND HE THINKS HE WAS NOT BROUGHT
[ct=5145.145] THE ROLE ON TOP OF A DEFENDER
[ct=5146.607] AND KEEPS ON GOING.
[ct=5147.170] THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
[ct=5153.114] KIRK: EARLIER, HE DID THIS EXACT
[ct=5155.283] SAME THING WHERE HE HAS HIS EYES
[ct=5156.066] ON HALL.
[ct=5157.191] HE KNOWS HE'S A DANGEROUS
[ct=5160.085] HE'S THERE TO MAKE THE PLAY.
[ct=5160.711] HE BOUNCES OFF OF RESOLVE.
[ct=5168.379] AL: THE REPLAY ASSIST SAID HE
[ct=5170.717] WAS DOWN.
[ct=5171.951] ORIGINALLY THEY WERE GOING TO
[ct=5172.787] PUT THEM UP AT THE 49.
[ct=5175.251] THERE HE WAS.
[ct=5180.896] KIRK: THINK OF BRAELON ALLEN
[ct=5182.898] BEING THE FISCAL BACK BUT
[ct=5185.781] RESOLVE BEING A 200 17 POUNDS,
[ct=5188.397] HE JUST BOUNCED OFF TO ATTILA.
[ct=5194.910] AL: 13 YARD GAIN, TO THE
[ct=5197.041] TAKEN DOWN AT THE 48.
[ct=5199.041] WITH THE LINEBACKER MAKING THE
[ct=5201.347] TACKLE.
[ct=5203.157] IT ONLY DOWN TO THREE MINUTES
[ct=5203.588] REMAINING IN THE THIRD QUARTER.
[ct=5207.272] THE -- KIRK: THE JETS HAVE HAD
[ct=5208.871] SOME INJURIES ON THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=5210.092] YOU HAD FOUR TACKLES IN THE GAME
[ct=5214.196] MAX MITCHELL IS IN RIGHT NOW
[ct=5214.540] PLAYING IT.
[ct=5215.693] HE'S A RIGHT TACKLE PLAYING LEFT
[ct=5218.378] GUARD IN THE ROOKIE IS PLAYING
[ct=5220.551] ALSO UP THERE IN THE RIGHT GUARD
[ct=5221.244] SPOT.
[ct=5224.301] ROTATING AND PLAYING WITH FOUR
[ct=5226.871] TACKLES OUT OF THE FIVE SPOTS.
[ct=5232.770] AL: TO THE 50, SETTING UP A
[ct=5233.134] THIRD DOWN.
[ct=5236.894] BRAELON ALLEN, THIRD AND THREE.
[ct=5238.781] TWO AND A HALF LEFT IN THE
[ct=5240.589] HOUSTON UP BY THREE.
[ct=5244.044] KIRK: WHEN YOU MAKE A MOVE LIKE
[ct=5245.399] THAT IT'S GREAT TO HAVE PLAYERS
[ct=5246.566] THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO MOVE
[ct=5250.361] FROM OUTSIDE TO INSIDE, BUT THAT
[ct=5252.780] CHALLENGES YOU WANT TO SHORT WE,
[ct=5253.132] THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE
[ct=5255.331] DEFENSE THAT CAN MOVE AROUND,
[ct=5255.972] IT'S TRYING TO PENETRATE.
[ct=5257.091] THE CALL IS UP FRONT.
[ct=5259.046] BEING ON THE SAME PAGE, THE
[ct=5259.740] CONTINUITY WILL BE TESTED FOR
[ct=5261.049] THE JETS ON THE LINE.
[ct=5271.751] AL: MOMENTARY STOPPAGE, THEY
[ct=5273.003] WILL ROLL THE CLOCK.
[ct=5277.359] 10 ON THE PLAY CLOCK.
[ct=5280.689] SNAP IT AT ONE.
[ct=5285.244] THAT'S A NICE GROUT THAT TIME,
[ct=5286.629] WILSON ABLE TO REACH FOR IT.
[ct=5288.445] HE STOPPED SHY FOR THE FIRST
[ct=5288.835] TIME BY PETRIE.
[ct=5291.490] FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=5292.989] THE CROWD WANTS HIM TO GO FOR
[ct=5294.236] ROGERS WILL WANT THEM TO GO FOR
[ct=5300.185] KIRK: EVERYONE IS EXCITED.
[ct=5301.328] IF YOU GET STOPPED, YOU GET
[ct=5302.992] BOOED OFF THE FIELD AND TEXANS
[ct=5303.669] GET GREAT FIELD POSITION.
[ct=5306.145] AL: OF COURSE, THAT’
[ct=5306.465] AL: OF COURSE, THAT'S HOW IT
[ct=5306.815] WORKS.
[ct=5309.223] ALAN IS IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=5315.106] TRYING TO GET A FREE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5321.306] THAT TEXAN LINE TRYING TO HOLD
[ct=5321.934] ITS GROUND, AND THEY DO.
[ct=5327.330] ROGERS WILL THROW IN OPENS.
[ct=5328.621] FIRST DOWN AND A LOT MORE AS
[ct=5330.369] DAVANTE ADAMS GETS FREE.
[ct=5331.619] NOW HE IS DOWN.
[ct=5335.181] KIRK:CTATIONS AND TAKES HIS SHAR
[ct=5335.348] OF THE HEAT.
[ct=5338.109] A TEAM THAT HAS NOT BEEN TO THE
[ct=5338.756] PLAYOFFS AND 13 YEARS.
[ct=5342.602] FINAL MINUTE OF THE QUARTER.
[ct=5347.541] RODGERS THROWS.
[ct=5350.142] BUSTED UP AT THE LINES.
[ct=5355.201] KIRK: WE DO NOT KNOW IF THAT WAS
[ct=5356.640] GOING TO BE FOURTH DOWN AND
[ct=5358.447] SHORT, IF HE WAS GOING TO GO FOR
[ct=5359.512] IT OR NOT.
[ct=5361.474] SIGNALING TO ADAMS WITH A THUMBS
[ct=5366.064] RODGERS SO OFTEN GIVES THOSE
[ct=5367.775] HAND SIGNALS, ESPECIALLY TO A
[ct=5368.088] VETERAN RECEIVER.
[ct=5370.077] WHAT A MOVE BY DAVANTE ADAMS.
[ct=5374.074] IT IS A PRIME MOVE HE MAKES
[ct=5374.838] AGAINST THAT YOUNG CORNER.
[ct=5379.552] AND THAT IS WHAT I THINK WHAT
[ct=5380.697] JETS FANS ARE EXPECTING TO SEE A
[ct=5383.055] LOT OF, WHEN DAVANTE ADAMS CAME
[ct=5407.468] OVER FROM THE RAIDERS.
[ct=5411.413] AL: 699 ON 10 TARGETS.
[ct=5411.413] TO THE NEAR SIDE.
[ct=5411.867] STOPPING AND MAKING THE GRAB
[ct=5412.472] THERE WAS WILSON.
[ct=5413.215] HE HAD TO SLOW DOWN AND MAKE THE
[ct=5413.954] BACK TO KAYLEE WE GO.
[ct=5414.082] >> DAVANTE ADAMS' EXTREMITIES
[ct=5414.743] SEEM TO BE FINE.
[ct=5415.320] WHEN HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN
[ct=5416.016] THE SIDELINE, A STAFFER ASKED
[ct=5416.547] FOR HIS HELMET, AND HE'S WITH
[ct=5417.118] THEM AND ECOLOGIST AS A TOOK A
[ct=5417.737] LOOK AT THE MONITORS.
[ct=5422.579] AL: THIRD AND 1.
[ct=5423.907] BREAKS A TACKLE ON THE BACKFIELD
[ct=5425.794] AND THEN GETS STOPPED SHORT OF
[ct=5427.257] THE LINE AND THAT IS GOING TO
[ct=5430.080] TAKE US TO THE FOURTH AND
[ct=5436.245] AL: FOURTH QUARTER, AL MICHAELS,
[ct=5438.148] KIRK, AND KAYLEE WITH YOU.
[ct=5442.654] VERY INTERESTING DECISION HERE.
[ct=5444.075] MEANWHILE, THERE IS ADAMS, WHO
[ct=5447.227] IS IN THE BLUE TECH.
[ct=5450.407] THERE IS ANDERSON.
[ct=5452.238] HE HAS BEEN IN AND OUT, BUT
[ct=5452.584] MAINLY OUT.
[ct=5455.223] YOU CAN TIE THE GAME WITH A 40
[ct=5456.652] YARD FIELD GOAL OR GO FOR IT AT
[ct=5458.219] FOURTH DOWN AND 1.
[ct=5460.796] BRAELON ALLEN IS THE BACK.
[ct=5464.676] RODGERS COMES UP IN THE PISTOL.
[ct=5471.924] RETREATS, SURVEYS, UNDER
[ct=5472.632] PRESSURE, NEARLY GET SACKED.
[ct=5476.028] PUSHING PAST, IT COULD HAVE BEEN
[ct=5476.840] INTERCEPTED BUT WAS NOT.
[ct=5479.670] THE FLAG IS THROWN.
[ct=5486.341] THERE IS A FLAG DOWN AT THE 15
[ct=5496.941] SHAWN HOCHULI GETTING HIS CUE
[ct=5500.648] FROM THE OTHER OFFICIALS.
[ct=5503.763] RODGERS WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT
[ct=5504.127] IS GOING ON.
[ct=5506.887] OBVIOUSLY.
[ct=5510.174] >> QUARTERBACK LEFT THE POCKET.
[ct=5512.257] ILLEGAL CONTACT.
[ct=5519.487] AL: WOW, SO INSTEAD OF TURNING
[ct=5523.593] IT OVER ON DOWNS, THEY CALL
[ct=5524.872] SINGLY.
[ct=5528.668] KIRK: HE'S UP AGAINST WILLIAMS,
[ct=5531.030] THE VETERAN PRESS MAN COVERAGE,
[ct=5532.001] HANDS, HANDS, HANDS, JUST
[ct=5532.748] GRABBING.
[ct=5535.740] AL: YOU HEARD HIM SAY BEFORE HE
[ct=5536.456] LEFT THE POCKET.
[ct=5543.327] WELL, WE HAVE SEEN WORSE,
[ct=5543.666] HEAVENLY?
[ct=5545.737] KIRK: YES.
[ct=5547.092] FROM THE 17 YARD LINE.
[ct=5549.800] ON FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5554.839] THROWING, THROWING, AND CAUGHT
[ct=5557.510] AT THE THIRD YARD LINE IS JEREMY
[ct=5557.832] RUCKER.
[ct=5562.446] MEANWHILE, A DEVANTE UPDATE.
[ct=5565.100] KAYLEE: THE JETS CONFIRMED THAT
[ct=5568.581] DAVANTE ADAMS IS BEING EVALUATED
[ct=5568.804] FOR A CONCUSSION IN THE LOCKER
[ct=5568.804] ROOM.
[ct=5571.137] AL: WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE
[ct=5571.557] BEEN THE SHOULDER.
[ct=5572.914] DOWN HE WENT.
[ct=5576.572] MEANTIME, HERE COMES THE 11TH
[ct=5577.212] PLAY OF THIS DRIVE.
[ct=5580.816] THE LAST DRIVE WENT 11 PLAYS AND
[ct=5581.296] RESULTED IN A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=5585.998] SO SECOND DOWN AND SIX.
[ct=5592.983] WILSON TO THE LEFT.
[ct=5595.687] THEY GO THAT WAY, AND THE TACKLE
[ct=5595.845] IS MADE THAT WAY.
[ct=5600.227] BEAUTIFULLY RED, TAKEN DOWN, AND
[ct=5602.251] CONKLIN IS TAKEN DOWN.
[ct=5604.704] AND NOW YOU HAVE GOT ANOTHER
[ct=5605.939] INJURED TEXAN HERE.
[ct=5611.347] >> TIMEOUT FOR INJURY.
[ct=5621.023] AL: AND APPEARS TO BE PETRI IN
[ct=5622.809] ON THE PLAY.
[ct=5623.270] THERE HE IS.
[ct=5627.997] KIRK: MIKE WILLIAMS HERE, YOU
[ct=5629.264] HAVE TWO GUYS GOING OUT TO BLOCK
[ct=5629.264] ONE.
[ct=5630.455] NOBODY PICKS UP PETRI, AND THE
[ct=5631.505] RESULT IS A LOSS.
[ct=5635.397] AL: AND A LITTLE BIT OF FRIENDLY
[ct=5635.915] FIRE AT THE END.
[ct=5642.830] HERE COMES --
[ct=5646.384] KIRK: TAKE A PEEK ONE MORE TIME,
[ct=5647.490] IT IS SUCH A BIG CALL.
[ct=5651.957] YOU HAVE FIVE YARDS, FOURTH AND1
[ct=5653.342] , WHERE SINGLY CAN WORK HIM.
[ct=5656.973] AND AT THIS POINT, HE CAN TOUCH
[ct=5660.302] HIM, BUT THAT IS JUST A GRAY
[ct=5660.597] AREA.
[ct=5662.639] THAT CALL AND GO ONE WAY OR THE
[ct=5665.914] OTHER, BUT IT GOES IN FAVOR OF
[ct=5667.956] I THOUGHT HE LET GO AFTER THAT
[ct=5668.555] FIVE YARD MARK.
[ct=5672.454] AL: THEY SAW IT THE OTHER WAY,
[ct=5675.148] AND NOW YOU HAVE AFTER THE
[ct=5679.329] INJURY TIMEOUT AT THIRD AND 9, A
[ct=5680.670] LITTLE OVER ONE MINUTE INTO THE
[ct=5681.683] FOURTH QUARTER.
[ct=5685.389] TEXANS ARE UP BY THREE.
[ct=5687.864] KIRK: ADAMS IS IN THE LOCKER
[ct=5689.294] ROOM, BEING LOOKED AT.
[ct=5693.595] AL: SO THEY SENT EVERYBODY OUT
[ct=5693.922] HERE.
[ct=5695.029] FIVE WIDE.
[ct=5697.739] KIRK: THERE IS GARRETT WILSON.
[ct=5701.586] AL: RODGERS LOOKED THAT WAY.
[ct=5705.298] OVER THE MIDDLE, AND NOW HE'S
[ct=5706.756] GOING TO TAKE OFF, AND HE'S
[ct=5707.076] GOING TO GET THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5710.034] FLAG DOWN.
[ct=5711.338] HE IS AT THE THREE.
[ct=5714.564] THERE IS A FLAG DOWN BACK AT THE
[ct=5714.564] 23.
[ct=5719.443] KIRK: YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF
[ct=5719.715] BACKUP OFFENSIVE TACKLES THAT
[ct=5720.133] ARE PLAYING GUARD.
[ct=5723.254] THAT IS WHO THEY GOT.
[ct=5728.339] AL: ROOKIE OUT OF PENN STATE.
[ct=5731.764] KIRK: HE IS IN PRETTY GOOD
[ct=5734.929] DECISION -- POSITION.
[ct=5736.767] A TOUGH TASK HERE.
[ct=5739.443] HE IS OK, BUT WHEN AARON ROGERS
[ct=5740.428] TAKES OFF, THAT IS WHERE HE
[ct=5740.739] GRABS ONTO HIM.
[ct=5746.201] YOU JUST HOLD YOUR BREATH, AND
[ct=5747.712] THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD JOB
[ct=5749.922] WORKING THROUGH THAT, NAVIGATING
[ct=5752.170] TO PICK UP HIS YARDS, BUT
[ct=5752.458] OBVIOUSLY, IT IS GOING TO COME
[ct=5753.613] BACK WITH A HOLD.
[ct=5758.693] AL: SO IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A
[ct=5760.121] FIRST AND GOAL AND BECOMES A
[ct=5761.672] THIRD AND 19.
[ct=5770.453] FOUR MAN RUSH.
[ct=5774.732] RODGERS TO THE END ZONE.
[ct=5776.088] AND WILSON.
[ct=5778.601] HE STAYS IN BOUNDS.
[ct=5780.038] THEY SAY HE WAS OUT.
[ct=5785.432] LASSITER HOVERING ON THAT PLAY.
[ct=5788.517] ALMOST A CATCH FOR THE AGES.
[ct=5791.036] KIRK: THE ONLY CHANCE WOULD BE
[ct=5792.807] THE KNEE IF IT CAME DOWN.
[ct=5794.446] WHAT A CATCH.
[ct=5798.207] WAITING FOR THAT OTHER FOOT,
[ct=5798.690] JUST DOES NOT GET DOWN AT THE
[ct=5799.028] KNEES.
[ct=5802.655] THAT IS WITH THE CROWD IS
[ct=5803.059] REACTING TO.
[ct=5809.998] A RIDICULOUS CATCH.
[ct=5814.013] MAYBE THE SHIN GETS DOWN.
[ct=5824.700] TERRY, WHAT ARE THEY LOOKINGT
[ct=5825.924] AFTER THAT INITIAL FOOT GOT DOWN
[ct=5826.796] WHEN IT CAME RIGHT THERE AT THE
[ct=5830.695] BACK L THE LEFT SHIN HIT THE GRO
[ct=5830.986] INBOUND.
[ct=5832.431] IT IS A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=5838.867] AL: WELL, 10 YEARS AGO IN THIS
[ct=5841.025] BALLPARK, ON THE OTHER SIDE OF
[ct=5844.148] THE FIELD, ODELL BECKHAM MADE
[ct=5846.644] ONE OF THE GREAT ONE HANDED
[ct=5848.008] GRABS OF ALL TIME.
[ct=5851.397] AND TONIGHT, IT IS NOT GET KIRK:
[ct=5851.722] ANY BETTER THAN THIS.
[ct=5854.681] KIRK:THAT IS AS GOOD A CATCH IS
[ct=5857.351] YOU WILL SEE, THE LEFT FOOT,
[ct=5859.495] AND, TERRY, THEY FELT THAT SHIN
[ct=5859.869] GOT DOWN BEFORE THE KNEE WENT
[ct=5863.503] >> THIS IS A GREAT SHOT.
[ct=5865.794] THAT SHIN TOUCHES IN BOUNDS
[ct=5868.050] BEFORE THE KNEE GOES OUT OF
[ct=5868.050] BOUNDS.
[ct=5873.722] THAT PUTS THEM IN BOUNDS FOR A
[ct=5874.106] CONTROLLED TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=5877.779] KIRK: UNBELIEVABLE BY WILSON.
[ct=5878.775] HOW ABOUT THAT THROW BY ROGERS?
[ct=5882.567] AL: AND THAT EXTRA POINT IS
[ct=5885.706] COUPLE OF MINUTES INTO THE
[ct=5888.894] FOURTH QUARTER ON A CATCH FOR
[ct=5891.795] THE AGES, ON A NIGHT ON THE JETS
[ct=5893.285] NEED EVERY BREAK
[ct=5894.585] POSSIBLY GET PERFECT.
[ct=5898.187] KIRK: WATCH LASSITER, THE
[ct=5899.234] DECISION TO MAKE THIS THERE WAS
[ct=5901.309] AARON ROGERS SAYING MY GUYS
[ct=5901.309] BETTER THAN YOURS.
[ct=5903.352] LOOK AT THAT COVERAGE.
[ct=5905.759] HE WILL STILL THROW THIS BALL,
[ct=5907.866] COUNTING ON THIRD AND LONG,
[ct=5909.513] GARRETT WILSON TO ADJUST BACK
[ct=5910.635] AND MAKE THE CATCH.
[ct=5912.729] I DON'T KNOW IF HE KNEW IT WOULD
[ct=5913.232] BE THIS GOOD.
[ct=5916.046] THIS IS AS GOOD A CATCH IS AS
[ct=5916.430] GOOD A CATCH AS YOU WILL EVER
[ct=5916.730] SEE.
[ct=5919.042] THE BODY CONTROL, THAT STRENGTH
[ct=5923.995] OF HIS, GOING BACK TO HIS ENTIRE
[ct=5925.486] CAREER AT OHIO STATE.
[ct=5928.395] THE JETS HAVE BEEN WAITING WITH
[ct=5929.876] THEIR BEST PLAYERS TO MAKE THE
[ct=5934.652] PLAYS IN CRITICAL MOMENTS, AND
[ct=5934.938] AARON ROGERS AND GARRETT WILSON
[ct=5935.890] JUST DID THAT HERE IN THE FOURTH
[ct=5940.291] AL: WILSON HAS ALL TOUCHDOWNS
[ct=5943.260] ADAMS BEING EVALUATED FOR A
[ct=5945.655] CONCUSSION, WATCHING THAT IN THE
[ct=5945.972] LOCKER ROOM.
[ct=5949.744] A PENNY FOR HIS THOUGHTS.
[ct=5957.586] SPEAKING OF THE 1-YARD LINE,
[ct=5960.369] HERE COMES SIMS.
[ct=5960.649] HE GETS WHACKED.
[ct=5965.062] TAKES IT TO THE FAR CENTER.
[ct=5970.559] MEANWHILE, THIS WAS THE CATCH 10
[ct=5971.086] YEARS AGO.
[ct=5976.236] ODELL BECKHAM MADE THAT GRAB.
[ct=5987.046] THE FLAG WAS THROWN.
[ct=5987.563] GIVEN TO DEFENSE.
[ct=5988.863] KIRK: WHAT MADE THAT IMPRESSIVE,
[ct=5989.590] IT WAS WAY BACK THERE AND THAT
[ct=5990.033] STARTED A TREND ALL OVER
[ct=5991.487] FOOTBALL, WHERE EVERYBODY,
[ct=5992.263] CATCHES AND PRACTICE WITH ONE
[ct=5992.626] HAND.
[ct=5997.239] THAT WAS THE FORERUNNER TO
[ct=5997.896] EVERYONE TRYING TO MAKE THAT
[ct=6000.327] AND WE HAVE SEEN A FEW THROUGH
[ct=6000.691] THE YEARS.
[ct=6003.810] STROUD ROLLING IT.
[ct=6004.785] HE IS THROWING DEEP.
[ct=6008.155] AND HE HITS HIM AT THE 20 YARD
[ct=6013.257] SO THE TEXANS COME RIGHT BACK
[ct=6015.357] WITH A BIG-TIME ANSWER, 50
[ct=6019.036] KIRK: THEY SHOW YOU TWO TITANS
[ct=6020.798] ON FIRST AND 10, AND THEY HAVE
[ct=6022.114] DONE IT ALL NIGHT.
[ct=6025.285] PLAY-ACTION, GET STROUD AWAY
[ct=6027.232] FROM THE PRESSURE, DO NOT WAIT
[ct=6029.349] UNTIL THIRD DOWN, WERE OFFENSIVE
[ct=6031.157] LINE CAN TURN THE PRESSURE ON
[ct=6034.477] GET HIM OUTSIDE, AND HE WAS
[ct=6036.154] GOING TO BE THE GUY TO STEP UP
[ct=6040.340] WITH INJURIES TO NICO COLLINS?
[ct=6041.649] AND TODAY, IT IS HIM.
[ct=6044.534] AL: 120 CV YARDS.
[ct=6047.044] TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=6048.493] BREAKING A TACKLE.
[ct=6056.626] AND IT IS NOW CARRY 20 TIMES FOR
[ct=6056.953] 98 YARDS.
[ct=6059.576] KIRK: KEEP THIS IN MIND AS WE
[ct=6061.060] GET DOWN TO CRUNCH TIME AND THE
[ct=6063.339] FOURTH QUARTER, THE JETS HAVE
[ct=6064.480] STRUGGLED ALL YEAR AND ONE
[ct=6064.789] POSITION GAMES.
[ct=6068.563] THERE 1-4 IN ONE POSITION GAMES,
[ct=6072.095] AND THE TEXANS, THEY ARE 5-1 IN
[ct=6074.079] THESE ONE POSITION GAMES, AND IF
[ct=6074.767] YOU GO BACK THE LAST COUPLE OF
[ct=6077.179] YEARS, THE TEXANS KNOW HOW TO
[ct=6077.843] WIN THESE CLOSE GAMES.
[ct=6079.568] AL: THEY HAVE.
[ct=6082.540] THROUGH THE MIDDLE GOES J.J.
[ct=6082.540] TAYLOR.
[ct=6085.842] AND THAT WILL MAKE IT THIRD DOWN
[ct=6086.810] AND TWO.
[ct=6095.329] AL: ANOTHER TIMEOUT FOR INJURY.
[ct=6099.394] ISAIAH OLIVER.
[ct=6103.109] HE WILL COME OUT FOR AT LEAST
[ct=6103.109] ONE PLAY.
[ct=6106.614] KIRK: THEY JUST PICKED UP J.J.
[ct=6108.540] TAYLOR AND BROUGHT HIM IN
[ct=6112.645] YOU NEED THAT COMPLEMENT TO WHEN
[ct=6116.415] HE'S HEALTHY, AND TAYLOR 26 IS
[ct=6118.542] DONE A HECKUVA JOB RUNNING HARD
[ct=6127.728] AL: TAYLOR DO NOT PLAY AT ALL IN
[ct=6127.728] 2003.
[ct=6131.892] FREE AGENT THIS YEAR.
[ct=6134.613] DOING AN NICE JOB TONIGHT.
[ct=6142.759] MIXON IS BACK, THIRD AND ONE.
[ct=6145.001] ROLLING.
[ct=6148.388] AND GOING TO GET THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=6150.606] HE REACHES.
[ct=6152.193] THEY WILL SEE WHERE THEY SPOT
[ct=6154.891] KIRK: WHAT A PLAY AND A GUTSY
[ct=6157.756] CALL BY BOBBY'S FLUID.
[ct=6161.785] DID NOT GET THE BALL AND THAT
[ct=6163.359] RIGHT HAND TO BE ABLE TO EXTEND
[ct=6169.299] HE MOVES AT THE LAST SECOND, AND
[ct=6169.960] STROUD SHOWING, HE TRIED TO BAIT
[ct=6171.431] THE DEFENSE, GOOD JOB OF THE
[ct=6171.715] JETS COVERING IT.
[ct=6174.945] AT THE LAST SECOND, HE PUTS IT
[ct=6175.505] IN THE LEFT-HAND TO PROTECT IT.
[ct=6180.590] THAT IS WHAT KEPT IT FIRST DOWN.
[ct=6184.564] >> MEDICAL TIMEOUT.
[ct=6188.882] AL: AND NOW YOU HAVE ANOTHER
[ct=6189.516] MEDICAL TIMEOUT.
[ct=6198.521] WHEN THEY SEE THAT WITH NOBODY
[ct=6200.293] DOWN ON THE FIELD, THAT MEANS
[ct=6201.007] THE OFFICIAL IS TAKING A PLAYER
[ct=6204.033] THAT IS ALL, WHO WAS OUT, CAME
[ct=6206.324] BACK IN, NOW THEY HAVE TAKEN
[ct=6206.780] THEM OUT AGAIN.
[ct=6215.663] SO 10.5 LEFT IN THE FOURTH.
[ct=6224.721] STROUD WILL GO UNDER CENTER.
[ct=6227.456] MIXON IS THE BACK.
[ct=6231.615] GETS IT, HEAD DOWN.
[ct=6234.610] TO THE 12.
[ct=6238.054] KIRK: YOU GET BEHIND THAT RIGHT
[ct=6242.592] SIDE OF THE OFFENSIVE LINE, LOOK
[ct=6242.976] AT THE OPENING THERE.
[ct=6245.933] THEY ARE EXPECTING THE
[ct=6249.348] QUARTERBACK, AND THEY GOT AWAY
[ct=6250.108] FROM THAT INTERIOR AND GOT THE
[ct=6250.789] BALL TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=6254.644] JUST TESTING HIM WITH THAT JUMP
[ct=6256.483] CUT AND THE WAY HE HAS BEEN
[ct=6256.483] RUNNING ALL YEAR.
[ct=6261.381] AL: MIXON, 100 YARDS NOW, 21
[ct=6261.381] CARRIES.
[ct=6267.605] HE IS THE BACK AGAIN, HAS THE
[ct=6271.654] BALL AGAIN, TAKEN OUT OF THE 11
[ct=6277.364] KIRK: HE ALMOST WAS ABLE TO PULL
[ct=6278.943] OUT OF THEIR AND GET BACK TO THE
[ct=6280.580] BACKSIDE, BUT SHERWOOD WILL GET
[ct=6283.303] IN FOR C.J. MOSLEY.
[ct=6287.661] HE WAS A MENTOR FOR HIM IN THE
[ct=6292.388] MIDDLE OF THAT DEFENSE AND SAYS
[ct=6293.100] HE PRACTICES ALL THE TIME.
[ct=6294.905] MAKING SURE HE IS DOING HIS JOB,
[ct=6295.664] AND MADE A GREAT PLAY ON THAT
[ct=6296.064] CUTBACK RUN.
[ct=6299.359] AL: SECOND AND 7.
[ct=6305.818] NOW THEY ARE GOING TO SNAP IT.
[ct=6308.346] STROUD COMES OUT TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=6311.286] AND HE'S GOING TO SNAP
[ct=6315.539] HE WILL THROW IT, AND
[ct=6316.047] OVERTHROWS.
[ct=6318.020] STROUD IS LOOKING FOR A FLAG.
[ct=6322.294] SO THEY GO TO THE BACK OF THE
[ct=6326.354] PLAYBOOK WHERE MIXON THREW A
[ct=6328.107] TOUCHDOWN PASS AND THE SUPER
[ct=6328.509] BOWL AGAINST THE RAMS.
[ct=6334.642] KIRK: STROUD CAME UP BECAUSE SEE
[ct=6336.049] GRABBED ONTO HIS ARM.
[ct=6339.416] OF COURSE, A THREAT TO RUN THE
[ct=6342.073] WHOLE DEFENSE, COMES UP TO STOP
[ct=6344.208] THEM EXCEPT FOR REED, WHO IS
[ct=6344.383] ONE-ON-ONE.
[ct=6348.428] AND STROUD NOW HAS A DIFFERENT
[ct=6349.450] PERSPECTIVE.
[ct=6352.380] NOW HE FELT IT HIMSELF.
[ct=6356.926] AL: THIRD AND 7.
[ct=6359.391] STROUD, TAKING IT ALL THE WAY
[ct=6362.568] BACK TO THE 27 BY MICHEAL
[ct=6362.808] CLEMONS.
[ct=6373.113] KIRK: I'VE BEEN BRAGGING ABOUT
[ct=6373.632] KENDRICK GREEN AND THE JOB HE
[ct=6376.740] HAS DONE STEPPING UP, AND THIS
[ct=6377.866] TIME, HE GETS OVERMATCHED BY
[ct=6380.685] CLEMENS, USED TO SEEING WILLIAMS
[ct=6382.510] MAKE THAT PLAY, BUT IT IS
[ct=6382.767] MICHEAL CLEMONS’
[ct=6384.741] MICHEAL CLEMONS' TIME WHO USED A
[ct=6386.632] GREAT MOVE AT THE LINE OF
[ct=6387.316] SCRIMMAGE FOR QUICKNESS AND
[ct=6389.518] POWER AND THEN FINISHES IT OFF
[ct=6391.125] AS STROUD TRIED TO ESCAPE.
[ct=6396.103] AL: 15 YARD SACK AND THAT TURNS
[ct=6397.260] THIS INTO A 43 YARD FIELD GOAL
[ct=6398.665] INSTEAD OF A CHIP SHOT.
[ct=6401.701] TO MAKE IT A ONE-POINT GAME.
[ct=6406.555] FEEDS IT THROUGH.
[ct=6412.003] SO WITH 8:19 WITH ANOTHER FLAG.
[ct=6414.649] KIRK: ANOTHER ONE CAME IN.
[ct=6415.144] YEAH.
[ct=6425.442] AL: SHAWN HOCHULI GETTING THE
[ct=6425.442] INFO.
[ct=6426.786] ANSWER IS --
[ct=6428.849] >> PERSONAL FOUL.
[ct=6431.737] UNNECESSARY CONTACT OF A SNAPPER
[ct=6432.083] BY THE DEFENSE.
[ct=6440.447] AL: OH, BABY.
[ct=6448.931] KIRK: ERIC WATTS, OUT 58, ROOKIE
[ct=6450.306] OUT OF YUKON.
[ct=6450.871] HE IS LINED UP RIGHT HERE.
[ct=6459.579] AL: UP IN THE AIR.
[ct=6463.925] KIRK: HE DRIVES HIS LEG RIGHT
[ct=6466.493] INTO THE SNAPPER'S HEAD, AND
[ct=6468.973] THAT IS WHY THEY MADE THE CALL,
[ct=6468.973] WHICH IS THE RIGHT CALL.
[ct=6473.852] AL: SO THE FLAG COMES UP
[ct=6474.487] IMMEDIATELY.
[ct=6477.283] PUTS THEM AT THE 12 YARD LINE.
[ct=6482.613] AND A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=6491.460] STAYS ON HIS FEET.
[ct=6495.046] GETS TO THE 10.
[ct=6499.726] KIRK: LET'S SEE IF THE TEXANS
[ct=6500.317] CAN CAPITALIZE ON THIS
[ct=6504.810] ANOTHER MISCUE FOR THE JETS ON
[ct=6505.252] SPECIAL TEAMS.
[ct=6512.078] AND NOW, ROUGHING THE SNAPPER,
[ct=6513.861] WHICH YOU DON'T SEE OFTEN, AND
[ct=6516.447] GIVES C.J. STROUD SECOND LIFE
[ct=6519.431] YEAR, A CHANCE TO FINISH THE
[ct=6521.116] DRIVE OFF, DOWN FOUR.
[ct=6525.290] AL: STUFFED AGAIN.
[ct=6529.416] MIXON TAKEN DOWN THAT TIME.
[ct=6534.928] SO YOU HAVE A THIRD DOWN AND 7.
[ct=6540.115] KIRK: GREAT SHOT, JALEN MILLS
[ct=6540.115] HELPING OUT.
[ct=6545.399] I CAN IMAGINE HOW THEY FELT
[ct=6546.924] RUNNING OFF THE FIELD, AND THEN
[ct=6549.580] THEY HAVE TO COME BACK OUT, AND
[ct=6550.877] THEY HAVE STEPPED UP THESE FIRST
[ct=6551.078] TWO PLAYS.
[ct=6555.580] AL: SOME CRAZY STUFF ON
[ct=6558.964] THIRD AND SEVEN.
[ct=6568.992] STROUD FIRES, NO GOOD.
[ct=6575.061] COVERAGE WAS VERY GOOD.
[ct=6578.394] STROUD COULD NOT CONNECT.
[ct=6582.092] STROUD IS NOW EIGHT OF 19.
[ct=6585.438] KIRK: STROUD WORKS FROM THE LEFT
[ct=6587.619] AND THEN CAME BACK, GIVING HIM
[ct=6587.619] ENOUGH TIME.
[ct=6590.814] MACHI SEASON BACK THERE, AND
[ct=6592.260] THEN HE COMES BACK AND WORKS
[ct=6595.286] BACK UNDERNEATH WHERE HE IS
[ct=6595.661] OPEN.
[ct=6597.098] HE ACTUALLY PULLED AWAY FROM THE
[ct=6599.118] DEFENDER AND HAD A CHANCE HERE,
[ct=6600.157] AND HE IS IN THE END ZONE.
[ct=6600.645] THAT IS A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=6608.156] AL: 27 YARD ATTEMPT, TOWNSEND
[ct=6610.278] PUTS IT DOWN, AND HE SNAPPED
[ct=6616.492] AMAZING.
[ct=6619.444] THINGS GO ONE WAY, THEN THE
[ct=6623.410] THIS IS LIKE EVERY NIGHT IN NEW
[ct=6623.656] ORLEANS.
[ct=6628.441] THE JETS NOW.
[ct=6631.231] TOSSED BACK HERE.
[ct=6636.843] SOME SPACE, TACKLED IN BOUNDS AT
[ct=6636.843] THE 22 YARD LINE.
[ct=6641.314] KIRK: 6:40 TO GO IN THE GAME, UP
[ct=6644.267] FOUR, LOST FIVE IN A ROW, YOUR
[ct=6646.998] QUARTERBACK AARON RODGERS THEY
[ct=6649.237] CAN GET A WIN TONIGHT, STARTING
[ct=6650.743] TO LOOK AT THAT SCHEDULE,
[ct=6651.775] STARTING TO GET POSITIVE, AND
[ct=6652.851] THE BALL IS IN YOUR COURT.
[ct=6655.417] AARON AND THE JETS HAVE THE
[ct=6655.849] LEAD.
[ct=6657.775] THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TURN
[ct=6660.413] THIS SEASON AROUND BY TRYING TO
[ct=6660.774] FINISH THIS GAME OFF.
[ct=6664.531] AL: NOTHING YOU LOVE BETTER THAN
[ct=6665.892] A EATING DRIVE AT THIS POINT.
[ct=6671.965] FROM THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=6677.941] BREECE HALL.
[ct=6685.854] SO 14 TIMES, 70 YARDS, FIVE
[ct=6689.938] KIRK: WE JUST TALKED ABOUT, HOW
[ct=6690.412] BAD DO YOU WANT THIS.
[ct=6693.910] GOOD JOB, A LITTLE PENETRATION.
[ct=6697.150] HE BOUNCES OFF A TACKLER, WHICH
[ct=6697.369] WOULD HAVE BEEN HEWITT.
[ct=6701.210] AARON ROGERS KNOWS HOW BIG THAT
[ct=6701.210] ONE WAS.
[ct=6703.704] AL: STAYS IN BOUNDS.
[ct=6706.526] NOBODY WORKS THAT CLOCK BETTER
[ct=6707.964] THAN NUMBER EIGHT.
[ct=6710.400] TAKING UP PLAY CLOCK DOWN,
[ct=6711.906] INSIDE FIVE.
[ct=6715.903] AND 5.5.
[ct=6719.822] WILSON IS TRYING TO STAY IN, AND
[ct=6720.369] HE DOES.
[ct=6722.371] LASSITER MAKES THAT TACKLE.
[ct=6725.252] KIRK: KEEP IN MIND, YOU HAVE MAX
[ct=6728.683] MITCHELL IN PLAIN GUARD, YOU
[ct=6731.215] HAVE DAVANTE ADAMS IN THE LOCKER
[ct=6733.995] ROOM AFTER HE WENT DOWN WITH AN
[ct=6737.195] INJURY, SO LAZARD IS NOT PLAYING
[ct=6739.966] TONIGHT, SO THIS TEAM HAS GOTTEN
[ct=6740.982] BACKED UP INTO A CORNER ON A
[ct=6742.774] SHORT WEEK, AND THEY HAVE A FOUR
[ct=6745.649] POINT LEAD, AND THEY ARE JUST
[ct=6746.280] TRYING TO FIND A COUPLE OF PLAYS
[ct=6748.664] HERE TO WIN THIS GAME.
[ct=6752.001] AL: THE TEXANS ARE SAYING WE
[ct=6752.556] DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM,
[ct=6752.908] WE HAVE OUR OWN.
[ct=6760.635] GOING TO BE A THIRD DOWN AND TWO
[ct=6764.211] 43.
[ct=6770.421] KIRK: HERE COMES ADAMS.
[ct=6780.975] AL: DEVONTA DAVIS -- DAVANTE
[ct=6782.731] PASSING THE CONCUSSION PROTOCOL
[ct=6783.139] AND BACK OUT THERE.
[ct=6786.819] KIRK: BIG BACK IN THERE.
[ct=6787.222] ALAN.
[ct=6790.883] AL: YOU CAN START TO MAKE
[ct=6791.402] HOUSTON USE ITS TIMEOUTS.
[ct=6795.606] THIRD AND 1.
[ct=6801.894] TRYING TO GET HIM TO JUMP, AND
[ct=6802.686] THEY TAKE A TIMEOUT.
[ct=6805.884] EXACTLY FOUR MINUTES TO PLAY IN
[ct=6807.224] REGULATION.
[ct=6810.274] >> 30 SECOND TIMEOUT.
[ct=6816.720] AGAIN, LET'S SEE WHAT THIS MEANS
[ct=6817.484] FOR HOUSTON.
[ct=6821.047] THEY HAVE A TWO GAME LEAD, PLUS
[ct=6823.627] THE ONLY TIEBREAK OVER
[ct=6826.520] INDIANAPOLIS, BUT FOR THE JETS,
[ct=6826.924] BUFFALO LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE TO
[ct=6829.237] WIN THE DIVISION, BUT, YOU KNOW,
[ct=6832.045] EVER SINCE THEY WENT SEVENTH IN
[ct=6832.643] THE CONFERENCE AND A WILD CARD,
[ct=6833.089] THEY ARE NOT DEAD YET.
[ct=6836.704] KIRK: NO, AND YOU LOOK AT WHO
[ct=6837.297] THEY HAVE LEFT, THEY HAVE ONE
[ct=6839.337] TEAM THAT HAS A WINNING RECORD.
[ct=6842.141] EVERYBODY ELSE’
[ct=6842.587] EVERYBODY ELSE'S 500 OR BELOW.
[ct=6846.590] THIS WAS THE PIVOTAL SWING GAME
[ct=6846.590] FOR THEM.
[ct=6849.040] THE SEASON WAS GOING TO GO ONE
[ct=6850.860] WAY OR THE OTHER, AND
[ct=6852.143] IS.
[ct=6852.338] IT IS HERE FOR THE TAKING.
[ct=6856.080] AL: AS YOU POINTED OUT, WE ONE
[ct=6859.554] TEAM REMAINING ON THE SCHEDULE
[ct=6860.301] IS OVER 500.
[ct=6862.956] WE GO TO ARIZONA, REPLAY
[ct=6863.634] INDIANAPOLIS.
[ct=6866.936] MEANWHILE, A VERY BIG THIRD AND
[ct=6874.153] RODGERS, THROWING, COMPLETING,
[ct=6875.656] GETS A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=6880.667] MAKES HIS FIRST TARGET, HIS
[ct=6881.637] FIRST CATCH OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=6885.693] AND THE ONLY THING IS, IT STOPS
[ct=6886.422] THE CLOCK AND NOTHING ELSE.
[ct=6889.942] NOW HOUSTON HAS TO THINK ABOUT
[ct=6892.798] TAKING TIMEOUTS, FIRST AND 10,
[ct=6892.798] 11 YARD GAME HERE.
[ct=6895.125] KIRK: HOW ABOUT THE CALL HERE?
[ct=6898.893] YOU THINK WITH THE BIG BACK, GO
[ct=6901.430] THE SAFEWAY, YOU TRY TO GET THE
[ct=6902.714] YARDS YOU NEED, INSTEAD, HE
[ct=6903.009] PULLS IT OUT.
[ct=6905.850] I THOUGHT HE MIGHT THROW IT
[ct=6909.042] FURTHER DOWNFIELD, BUT INSTEAD,
[ct=6910.118] TAKES THE SHORT THROW
[ct=6910.118] UNDERNEATH.
[ct=6915.907] AL: GETS A GOT INTO THE ACTION
[ct=6916.250] WHO HAD NOT SEEN ANY ACTION
[ct=6918.380] NOTHING HERE.
[ct=6923.606] THIS IS ALLEN TAKEN DOWN.
[ct=6927.378] KIRK: PETRI IN THE PHYSICAL
[ct=6929.592] NO MATTER WHAT YOUR FORMATION
[ct=6932.209] IS, DEMECO RYANS BELIEVES IN
[ct=6933.726] HIM, THEY MOVED FROM FROM
[ct=6936.416] SAFETY, CLOSER TO THE LINE OF
[ct=6937.786] SCRIMMAGE, AND NO MATTER WHAT
[ct=6939.459] YOU COME UP IN, HE IS A TRUE
[ct=6944.026] HYBRID, RUN SUPPORT GUY, REALLY
[ct=6945.799] A PHYSICAL PLAYER AT 200 POUNDS,
[ct=6946.729] AND THEY COVER THAT SLOT
[ct=6953.884] AL: SECOND AND 12.
[ct=6957.357] BALL IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=6959.222] ADAMS WIDE TO THE LEFT.
[ct=6963.309] WILSON COMES OUT OF THE SLOT.
[ct=6963.309] MAKES THE CATCH.
[ct=6968.357] WILSON STAYS IN BOUNDS, KEEPS
[ct=6968.690] THE CLOCK MOVING.
[ct=6973.824] PETRI MAKES THE STOP, THIRD AND
[ct=6976.922] AND A TIMEOUT TAKEN HERE BY THE
[ct=6979.557] THERE FIRST.
[ct=6983.710] TWOLOOK AT THIS DEFENSE, EIGHT
[ct=6986.649] DIFFERENT DEFENDERS HAVE
[ct=6986.649] PRESSURED FIVE WITH A SACK.
[ct=6992.572] 51.6 PRESSURE RATE, SECOND
[ct=6993.312] HIGHEST IN STROUD'S CAREER.
[ct=6995.199] LAST YEAR AND HE CAME INTO THE
[ct=6997.729] GAME, HE GOT PRESSURE AGAINST
[ct=6998.094] THIS SAME DEFENSE.
[ct=7003.201] AL: A BAD DAY, CONCUSSION, MIXED
[ct=7005.465] THE NEST -- NEXT TWO GAMES.
[ct=7016.184] SO THIRD AND 3.
[ct=7018.203] AGAIN, IN THAT SITUATION WHERE
[ct=7019.696] WE PICK UP A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=7023.559] COMPELLING THE TEXANS TO TAKE AT
[ct=7025.282] LEAST ONE TIMEOUT, GET A TWO
[ct=7027.492] MINUTE WARNING, STOP THE CLOCK
[ct=7031.359] THREE TIMES, BUT A BIG, BIG STOP
[ct=7032.271] FOR THE TEXANS COMING HERE.
[ct=7036.390] KIRK: YOU CAN SEE HIM TALKING,
[ct=7038.042] MIKE WILLIAMS, EXTRA
[ct=7038.042] INSTRUCTIONS.
[ct=7045.021] AL: EXTRA PRESSURE.
[ct=7048.698] AND ADAMS, TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=7070.069] DAVANTE ADAMS, OUT OF CONCUSSION
[ct=7071.066] PROTOCOL, AND INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=7076.194] KIRK: WE KNOW HE IS TELLING MIKE
[ct=7078.544] WILLIAMS, STAY UPTIGHT, MAKE
[ct=7078.782] SURE YOU GIVE DAVANTE ADAMS
[ct=7082.472] ENOUGH ROOM TO WORK ON THAT
[ct=7084.175] STRAIGHT UP COVERAGE AGAINST
[ct=7084.175] PETRI.
[ct=7093.494] AL: PATTERSON.
[ct=7098.400] GOOD, 21-10.
[ct=7102.961] FIRST TOUCHDOWN AS A JET, AT 68
[ct=7105.686] IN GREEN BAY WITH NUMBER EIGHT.
[ct=7109.006] KIRK: HE HIT HIM ON A FOURTH AND
[ct=7113.644] 1, THIS TIME AGAINST PETRI.
[ct=7116.981] HE LOSES HIS CHALLENGE, BUT I
[ct=7118.077] DON'T THINK HE WILL BE ABLE TO
[ct=7118.077] STAY WITH HIM.
[ct=7122.067] HE IS EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED,
[ct=7123.604] AND THERE IS THE RHYTHM.
[ct=7126.579] THERE THEY ARE, EIGHT TO 17 THE
[ct=7128.196] WAY THE JETS FANS HAD HOPED WHEN
[ct=7128.359] THEY CAUGHT HIM.
[ct=7133.602] AL: USED TO BE 12-17.
[ct=7139.305] HE CHANGED UP, ADAMS STAYS THE
[ct=7140.539] SAME.
[ct=7142.917] CHECKING HIM OUT FOR A
[ct=7146.682] DOWN, OUT OF BOUNDS EARLIER IN
[ct=7154.673] CATCHES THIS ONE, AND, TONIGHT,
[ct=7157.900] 91 YARDS FOR HIM, 90 FOR WILSON,
[ct=7165.007] ROGERS NOW AT -- RODGERS NOW AT
[ct=7165.007] 2-11.
[ct=7169.113] KIRK: THE SECOND HALF, YOU START
[ct=7170.475] TO VISUALIZE WITH THE JETS
[ct=7173.216] OFFENSE, INSTEAD OF THE
[ct=7174.105] POTENTIAL OF IT, YOU SEE THE
[ct=7177.192] REALITY OF WHAT IT CAN BE THESE
[ct=7178.087] NEXT EIGHT WEEKS.
[ct=7181.810] AL: THREE TOUCHDOWNS ON THREE
[ct=7182.177] DRIVES.
[ct=7182.550] HERE IS SIMS.
[ct=7186.982] AL: RIGHT.
[ct=7189.650] AND JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO.
[ct=7195.511] KIRK: NOT MUCH SWEETER THAN
[ct=7196.619] THIS, CONSIDERING THE
[ct=7197.447] CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS TEAM
[ct=7197.734] NEEDING A WIN.
[ct=7201.755] AL: DESPERATELY.
[ct=7203.020] OUT OF THE DARKNESS AND INTO THE
[ct=7205.323] LIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN
[ct=7205.887] THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=7208.454] STROUD HAVING A ROUGH NIGHT
[ct=7212.759] STROUD GOING DEEP.
[ct=7218.602] INCOMPLETE, COVERED BY JALEN
[ct=7219.926] MILLS, SECOND AND 10.
[ct=7223.191] KIRK: WE TALK A LOT ABOUT WITH
[ct=7224.237] DIGGS DOWN THE REST OF THE YEAR
[ct=7226.114] WITH THE A.C.L., YOU GET INTO
[ct=7227.823] THESE OBVIOUS PASSING
[ct=7230.923] SITUATIONS, IT IS SUCH A
[ct=7233.407] DIFFERENT CHALLENGE FOR STROUD,
[ct=7235.918] THE PROTECTION, NOT HAVING HIS
[ct=7237.941] TWO MAIN TARGETS.
[ct=7239.164] THIS IS WHAT THE JETS HOPED TO
[ct=7242.137] DO EARLY, JUMP UP ON HIM TO
[ct=7242.775] ALLOW THE DEFENSE TO GET AFTER
[ct=7245.734] HIM AND BE ABLE TO PUT PRESSURE
[ct=7247.492] ON THESE RECEIVERS WITH TIGHT
[ct=7259.553] AL: CHASED AGAIN.
[ct=7263.550] DEEP DOWNFIELD, AND INCOMPLETE
[ct=7264.853] AT THREE.
[ct=7270.003] KIRK: THE JETS DOING A GOOD JOB
[ct=7270.730] SITTING BACK WITH TWO SAFETIES.
[ct=7272.795] THEIR WHOLE GOAL IS TO KEEP
[ct=7274.028] EVERYTHING IN FRONT OF THEM.
[ct=7278.836] AND WILLING TO GIVE UP
[ct=7281.484] COMPLETIONS UNDERNEATH WITH 11
[ct=7283.263] POINT LEAD, 2:33 TO GO.
[ct=7285.649] DON’
[ct=7286.323] DON'T GIVE UP THE EASY SCORE.
[ct=7298.194] AL: 18 PRESSURES, SEVEN SACKS.
[ct=7302.051] UNDER DURESS ALL NIGHT.
[ct=7309.704] DELAY OF GAME.
[ct=7311.025] BETTER THAN A TIMEOUT.
[ct=7315.387] YOU HAVE TWO LEFT, A TWO MINUTE
[ct=7315.387] WARNING.
[ct=7320.439] OF COURSE, IT COST YOU FIVE
[ct=7321.735] YARDS AND MAKES IT THIRD AND 15.
[ct=7325.206] AGAIN, THE STANDINGS FOR THE
[ct=7326.094] TEXANS, TWO GAME LEAD PLUS THE
[ct=7326.562] TIEBREAKER.
[ct=7333.996] THE BILLS ON TOP, 3.5 GAMES OVER
[ct=7334.209] THE DOLPHINS.
[ct=7338.053] AND THE JETS TRYING TO SCRAMBLE
[ct=7338.228] BACK INTO THE RACE.
[ct=7343.836] THIRD AND 15.
[ct=7345.183] STROUD THROWS.
[ct=7348.945] IT IS CAUGHT, AND ON TOP OF IT
[ct=7352.597] TO BOOT, TAKEN DOWN, SO IT IS
[ct=7356.595] FOURTH AND NINE, RACING UP TO
[ct=7359.974] THE LINE, HAS TO GO FOR IT,
[ct=7362.169] TRYING TO GET IT IN BEFORE THE
[ct=7363.196] TWO MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=7370.934] LEADS NINE.
[ct=7372.435] GETS NONE.
[ct=7375.161] FLAG, HOWEVER.
[ct=7379.457] KIRK: IT IS ON ISAIAH OLIVER,
[ct=7380.880] SITTING BACK IN ZONE.
[ct=7384.924] AND HE JUST BLOWS PLAY UP.
[ct=7387.051] DO NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE A
[ct=7393.368] >> DEFENSE, NUMBER 23, FIRST
[ct=7400.604] AL: AND IN MANY BREAK HERE, DOWN
[ct=7402.529] BY 11, BUT HE WILL TAKE ANYTHING
[ct=7402.899] HE CAN GET.
[ct=7404.874] ONE SECOND BEFORE THE TWO-MINUTE
[ct=7408.594] YOU STILL HAVE THREE CLOCK
[ct=7413.051] STOPPAGES, KIND OF A TWO MINUTE
[ct=7415.879] SO FIRST DOWN AT THE 43 YARD
[ct=7426.822] STROUD DENIED NINE OF 22 AND HAS
[ct=7429.095] BEEN VERY ACCURATE THE PAST TWO
[ct=7429.095] SEASONS.
[ct=7429.924] NOT TONIGHT.
[ct=7431.838] TOO MUCH PRESSURE.
[ct=7438.179] GETS IT AWAY, DOWN THE SIDELINE.
[ct=7441.846] CAN HE MAKE CATCH IN BOUNDS,
[ct=7442.225] OFFICIALS LOOK AT EACH OTHER,
[ct=7444.245] AND THEY GO WHAT.
[ct=7447.405] THEY GO NO.
[ct=7451.306] THAT IN.
[ct=7453.193] AL: FORGET THE WORLD SERIES.
[ct=7458.901] MEANWHILE, A DOWN AND 10 WITH
[ct=7459.852] 1:55.
[ct=7464.044] FIRES, AND CANNOT HIT HIM.
[ct=7468.065] INCOMPLETE, THIRD AND 10.
[ct=7470.720] KIRK: A TYPE WINDOW.
[ct=7473.357] HE DOES A GOOD ENOUGH JOB TO
[ct=7473.810] GIVE HIM A CHANCE.
[ct=7477.302] A ROUTE THAT TOOK TIME TO WORK
[ct=7477.814] ACROSS.
[ct=7480.494] HE HAD HIM, BUT IT WOULD HAVE
[ct=7481.523] HAD TO BEEN A PERFECT EURO.
[ct=7487.947] JETS DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB, ON
[ct=7489.818] REDDICK, WILL MCDONNELL.
[ct=7498.864] AL: THIRD AND 10, 1:49.
[ct=7502.814] EXTRA PROTECTION IN THE
[ct=7505.297] THEY FLARE AROUND.
[ct=7512.112] FIRES, AND STOPS SHORT OF THE
[ct=7512.112] FIRST DOWN, DALTON
[ct=7517.558] KIRK: THAT IS REALLY WHAT THE
[ct=7518.268] JETS DEFENSE WOULD LIKE, REALLY
[ct=7521.865] TO GIVE UP A COMPLETION, NOW YOU
[ct=7521.865] HAVE A FOURTH DOWN PLAY.
[ct=7531.985] AL: NEED TWO, HAS IT, HAS A LOT
[ct=7533.332] MORE, INSIDE THE 30, STEP OUT OF
[ct=7539.323] AS WE GET DOWN TO IT, YOU KEEP
[ct=7539.941] THE FIELD GOAL FIRST, YOU ARE
[ct=7544.692] DOWN 11, AND YOU GET A TWO POINT
[ct=7545.130] CONVERSION.
[ct=7545.871] THAT'S THE CHOICE YOU HAVE.
[ct=7548.347] KIRK: IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS
[ct=7549.331] WERE MAYBE YOU TAKE A SHOT INTO
[ct=7551.870] THE END ZONE, MAYBE A TIME OR
[ct=7552.776] TWO WERE YOU DON'T WASTE TOO
[ct=7554.238] MUCH TIME, AND THEN YOU
[ct=7556.424] FIELD GOAL.
[ct=7558.902] I'M SURPRISED THE JETS HAVE NOT
[ct=7559.203] TRIED TO SPY HIM.
[ct=7562.084] THAT TIME,
[ct=7563.325] AGAINST MAN COVERAGE, AND THERE
[ct=7564.395] WAS JUST NOBODY OUT THERE.
[ct=7566.237] THAT WAS BIG YARDAGE.
[ct=7570.235] AL: PART OF THAN EVER TO GET THE
[ct=7571.797] 11 THESE DAYS, HAVING TO DECLARE
[ct=7573.152] THE ONSIDE KICK.
[ct=7574.557] STROUD FIRES.
[ct=7580.659] ABLE TO GET IN THERE TO BUSTED
[ct=7581.210] UP, SECOND DOWN AND 10.
[ct=7584.226] KIRK: THAT IS A FAVORABLE
[ct=7587.554] MATCHUP FOR THE JETS, THE ROOKIE
[ct=7589.844] WHO WAS A GOOD TIGHT END, BUT A
[ct=7591.478] LITTLE PUSH OFF THERE, BUT THEN
[ct=7593.728] THAT LINK THAT GARDNER HAS
[ct=7596.198] THERE, JUST KIND OF EASED IN
[ct=7598.967] COVERAGE, GOT HIS EYES TURNED,
[ct=7601.051] FOUND THE FOOTBALL, AND TURNS IT
[ct=7601.051] AWAY.
[ct=7604.166] TOUGH TO GET A SEPARATION FOR A
[ct=7605.667] TIGHT END AGAINST NUMBER ONE.
[ct=7616.523] AL: STRAIGHT SHOT.
[ct=7617.434] THROUGH THE END ZONE.
[ct=7619.132] NOTHING.
[ct=7628.743] THIRD DOWN AND 10, 1:11 ON THE
[ct=7628.743] CLOCK.
[ct=7632.940] KIRK: YOU EXPECT THEM TO DO THAT
[ct=7634.076] , HE HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE
[ct=7638.033] DOING A GOOD JOB IN COVERAGE, WE
[ct=7639.445] HAVE SEEN HIM UP IN RUN SUPPORT.
[ct=7645.956] DAVANTE ADAMS FINALLY GETS A
[ct=7647.454] TOUCHDOWN IN A CRITICAL MOMENT.
[ct=7651.371] AL: AND A GAME THAT MIGHT HAVE
[ct=7652.699] TAKEN HIM OUT OF THE GAME IF HE
[ct=7652.894] DID NOT PASS PROTOCOL.
[ct=7659.985] THAT IS CAUGHT.
[ct=7663.871] FIRST DOWN, TRYING TO GET OUT OF
[ct=7667.130] ROBIN WOODS, SO NOW YOU ARE DOWN
[ct=7668.519] TO 65 SECONDS.
[ct=7670.072] KIRK: YOU KEEP PLUGGING AWAY
[ct=7673.228] THE RECEIVERS ARE DOING A GOOD
[ct=7675.680] JOB WITH WORDS, GETTING OUT OF
[ct=7678.332] BOUNDS, SAVING THE CLOCK YOU ARE
[ct=7678.682] THIS CLOSE.
[ct=7679.490] YOU HAVE TO PUT THE BALL INTO
[ct=7679.887] THE END ZONE.
[ct=7682.554] AL: AGREED, TOTALLY.
[ct=7688.552] YOU GET INTO THE END ZONE, YOU
[ct=7691.714] NEED THE TWO POINT CONVERSION.
[ct=7691.714] OTHERWISE, LIGHTS OUT.
[ct=7697.174] FIRST DOWN, FROM THE 12.
[ct=7702.506] TO THE END ZONE.
[ct=7703.871] TOO HIGH AGAIN.
[ct=7710.812] XAVIER HUTCHINSON, SO EXACTLY 60
[ct=7713.494] SECONDS, SECOND DOWN AND 10
[ct=7713.652] UPCOMING.
[ct=7717.626] KIRK: DAVIS GIVING STROUD ENOUGH
[ct=7719.501] TIME TO STEP UP IN THE POCKET,
[ct=7723.698] BUT THESE LAST FOUR OR FIVE
[ct=7723.926] PLAYS, HE HAS THROWN TO
[ct=7727.710] HUTCHISON, SCHOLZ, ROBERT WOODS,
[ct=7729.253] HE'S TRYING TO FIND ANYBODY
[ct=7730.506] CAN FIND EITHER AN OPENING
[ct=7734.911] AGAINST ZONE FOUR PULL ACROSS ON
[ct=7737.120] THESE CROSSERS AGAINST MAN
[ct=7744.306] AL: ROLLING.
[ct=7745.717] BUYING TIME.
[ct=7747.802] OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=7748.706] STOP THE CLOCK AFTER EIGHT
[ct=7751.292] SECONDS HAD GONE BY.
[ct=7753.887] AND WHILE, YOU HAVE A DOG DOWN.
[ct=7757.054] IN GAME TESTING 140 YARDS OF
[ct=7761.806] PENALTIES, 60 AGAINST HOUSTON,
[ct=7761.806] 80 AGAINST NEW YORK.
[ct=7769.486] >> HOLDING, DEFENSE, NUMBER ONE.
[ct=7773.061] THE PENALTY IS HALF THE DISTANCE
[ct=7773.061] TO THE GOAL, ADDED TO THE PLAY,
[ct=7776.670] AL: GARDNER.
[ct=7781.187] KIRK: GARDNER AGAINST HUTCHINSON
[ct=7782.451] I THINK IT HAPPENS MAY INTO THE
[ct=7782.810] END ZONE.
[ct=7785.769] HUTCHINSON TRYING TO GET THEM
[ct=7786.659] OFF THAT RIGHT ARM.
[ct=7788.051] THAT IS WHERE THE FLAG CAME IN
[ct=7788.275] RIGHT THERE.
[ct=7794.664] WELL, THEY GOT IT DOWN TO ABOUT
[ct=7795.347] THE THREE YARD LINE HERE.
[ct=7797.278] AL: FIRST AND GOAL.
[ct=7800.000] 52 SECONDS.
[ct=7802.903] KIRK: BEEN ABLE TO PRESERVE THE
[ct=7803.149] TIMEOUTS, TOO.
[ct=7805.474] AL: STILL HAVE TWO.
[ct=7808.861] NEEDS TO GET THE TWO POINT
[ct=7810.680] CONVERSION TO AT LEAST MAKE IT
[ct=7812.450] SOMEWHAT DRAMATIC AT THE END.
[ct=7819.757] SURVEYING, LOOK OUT.
[ct=7826.940] SO THAT IS ANOTHER FIVE SECONDS
[ct=7829.384] OFF THE CLOCK, 47 TO GO.
[ct=7832.325] THERE IS GARDNER.
[ct=7839.496] HE WILL HAVE TO COME OUT FOR AT
[ct=7840.394] LEAST A PLAY.
[ct=7844.402] KIRK: HOW MANY --
[ct=7846.858] AL: HOW MANY END OF GAME
[ct=7847.314] INJURIES DO YOU SEE?
[ct=7850.280] >> NEW YORK IS CHARGED A
[ct=7857.050] KIRK: HE IS JUST TRYING TO STAY
[ct=7857.560] UP WITH STEVEN SIMS.
[ct=7860.781] WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THESE
[ct=7861.151] CROSSING ROUTES.
[ct=7862.700] THAT IS WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO
[ct=7862.700] DO.
[ct=7865.802] AND IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS ALREADY
[ct=7866.737] FEELING SOMETHING.
[ct=7874.601] THE CHANGE IN DIRECTION.
[ct=7881.156] AL: SO YOU HAVE THE 14TH PLAY OF
[ct=7882.146] A DRIVE COMING.
[ct=7885.463] TEXANS HAVE RUN 70 FOUR PLACE
[ct=7889.291] THE JETS HAVE -- 74 PLACE
[ct=7893.267] ECCLES COMES IN, HE'S BEEN IN
[ct=7893.654] AND OUT TONIGHT.
[ct=7896.129] THREE RECEIVERS OFF TO THE LEFT.
[ct=7898.226] TWO TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=7906.058] STROUD GETS TAKEN DOWN AT THE 15
[ct=7907.835] HAASON REDDICK COMING IN.
[ct=7912.087] WILLIAMS IS ALSO IN THE
[ct=7912.637] NEIGHBORHOOD.
[ct=7913.094] THAT IS EIGHT SACKS TONIGHT.
[ct=7914.965] AND HOUSTON TAKES A TIMEOUT.
[ct=7920.466] KIRK: THIS IS WHAT REDDICK
[ct=7921.877] SUPPOSED TO DO IN THESE
[ct=7922.590] SITUATIONS, WHERE YOU CAN GET
[ct=7924.882] HIM HOME WITHOUT HAVING TO
[ct=7925.425] NECESSARILY BLITZ.
[ct=7927.633] HE HAS THE ABILITY TO WIN
[ct=7930.780] AGAINST HOWARD, AND THIS FORCES
[ct=7930.780] THEM TO STEP UP.
[ct=7932.857] YOU MENTIONED WILLIAMS AND
[ct=7935.033] REDDICK BOTH ABLE TO COME UP,
[ct=7938.403] BUT JUST THE ABILITY TO MAKE A
[ct=7939.686] QUARTERBACK FEEL THAT PRESSURE,
[ct=7941.522] AND THEN YOU GET TO PUSH IN THE
[ct=7941.864] INTERIOR, NOWHERE TO GO.
[ct=7946.661] THAT WAS THE KEY3
[ct=7947.868] -- NOWHERE TO GO.
[ct=7949.330] THAT WAS THE KEY TONIGHT.
[ct=7952.813] AL: HE HAS MISSED TWO FIELD
[ct=7952.813] GOALS.
[ct=7955.241] THE THIRD TIME THAT HAS
[ct=7955.241] HAPPENED.
[ct=7958.478] TRYING TO MAKE IT AN EIGHT POINT
[ct=7961.170] ONSIDE KICK WOULD COME AFTER
[ct=7963.280] THAT IF HE MAKES IT, WHICH HE
[ct=7966.387] DOES, SO IT IS 21-13.
[ct=7971.685] NOW YOU TO CLEAR THE ONSIDE KICK
[ct=7972.450] AND SAY A SMALL PRAYER.
[ct=7982.336] AND WEGAME, OF COURSE AS USUAL,'
[ct=7983.405] OUR GANG.
[ct=7987.613] NOTHING LIKE IT EITHER.
[ct=7995.635] WE HAVE WILSON'S HEROICS.
[ct=7999.366] AND THE GANG IS ALL THERE.
[ct=8003.337] THEY WILL BE BACK AT THE HOTEL
[ct=8003.859] PROBABLY AROUND 3:00.
[ct=8007.443] KIRK: QUITE A NIGHT ON THE OTHER
[ct=8009.399] SIDE FOR AARON RODGERS
[ct=8010.123] CONSIDERING WE WERE TALKING
[ct=8012.660] ABOUT THE FIRST HALF INNING, ONE
[ct=8014.240] OF THE WORST HE HAS HAD AS FAR
[ct=8017.263] AS PRODUCTION IS CONCERNED HIS
[ct=8018.950] ENTIRE CAREER.
[ct=8022.235] THREE TOUCHDOWNS AND NO
[ct=8022.615] INTERCEPTIONS.
[ct=8027.249] AL: ONLY 9% OF THE ONSIDE
[ct=8030.438] KICK'S, ONE OUT OF 11 ARE
[ct=8031.809] RECOVERED BY THE TEAM.
[ct=8035.767] THEN YOU NEED TO RECOVER IT AND
[ct=8036.956] GET A TOUCHDOWN AND A TWO POINT
[ct=8041.407] THEY HAVE GARRETT WILSON.
[ct=8048.064] AND THE BOUNCING BALL WILL BE
[ct=8050.137] STOPPED BY ADAMS SO THERE IT IS.
[ct=8055.674] HOUSTON CAN STOP IT WITH ONE
[ct=8056.283] MORE TIME OUT AND THAT WILL TAKE
[ct=8059.412] THE JETS TO THE END OF A
[ct=8059.661] FIVE-GAME LOSING STREAK.
[ct=8065.950] SO THEY START OUT 2-1.
[ct=8068.746] ROGERS HAD A BIG NIGHT.
[ct=8072.725] LOOKING TO GET HIS FIRST VICTORY
[ct=8073.244] AS INTERIM HEAD COACH.
[ct=8076.771] >> HOW ABOUT AARON RODGERS
[ct=8079.629] TELLING US ON THE CALL THIS WEEK
[ct=8081.149] I CANNOT WAIT TO HAND HIM THAT
[ct=8082.765] GAME BALL ON HIS FIRST WIN?
[ct=8085.240] HE WILL GET THE CHANCE TONIGHT.
[ct=8090.140] AL: YOU HAVE INDIANA, SEATTLE,
[ct=8091.648] MIAMI, JACKSONVILLE.
[ct=8096.031] ROGERS WILL TAKE A KNEE.
