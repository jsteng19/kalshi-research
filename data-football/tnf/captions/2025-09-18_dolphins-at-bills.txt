HAD TWO RUSHING TOUCHDOWNS
TO GO WITH TWO PASSING
TOUCHDOWNS IN THAT CRAZY
OPENER AGAINST THE RAVENS.
SO BUFFALO WILL KICKOFF.
THEY WON THE TOSS.
THEY HAVE DEFERRED.
MATT PRATER TO KICKOFF.
WASHINGTON HAD A 74 YARD
PUNT RETURN TOUCHDOWN
AGAINST NEW ENGLAND FOUR
DAYS AGO.
PERFECT NIGHT.
TEMPERATURE IN THE UPPER
60S, A LIGHT BREEZE, AND
OFF WE GO.
ESKRIDGE WILL RUN IT BACK.
TO THE OUTSIDE HE GOES WITH
SOME ROOM.
AND THE DOLPHINS GET JUST
WHAT THEY NEED TO START
THINGS.
THEY RUN BACK ALL THE WAY TO
THE 50 YARD LINE.
STRONG RUNS HIM OUT.
SO TAGOVAILOA, IN HIS SIXTH
SEASON IN THE LEAGUE, TAKES
OVER AT THE 54 YARD LINE.
AGAINST THE BILLS, 1-8.
NINE TDS, 10 PICKS.
THEY HAVE HAD HIS NUMBER.
A CHALLENGE TONIGHT.
HE HAS FOUR NEW OFFENSIVE
LINEMAN.
THE CENTER THE REALLY --
REALLY THE ONLY
EXPERIENCED MAN.
AL: BLIND-SIDED.
THEY START WITH PLAY-ACTION.
THROWS.
THATS CAUGHT.
REACHING UPWARD, MAKING THE
GRAB.
JOHNSON RUNS HIM OUT OF
BOUNDS.
IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND
FIVE.
KIRK: MIAMI IS OBVIOUSLY
BUILT WITH SPEED.
BUFFALO WANTS TO DO
EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER AS
A UNIT TO KEEP THIS SPEED IN
FRONT OF THEM, NOT GET THESE
FLEET FOOTED RECEIVERS A LOT
OF SPACE.
THEYVE GOT TO LEVERAGE THE
FOOTBALL AND RALLY.
AL: TWO YEARS AGO, WHEN THEY
LED THE LEAGUE IN OFFENSE,
THEY WERE A TRACK TEAM.
SEVE -- 7-5.
A RUN ON THE INSIDE.
STUFFED.
ACHANE STOPPED AT THE LINE
OF SCRIMMAGE.
THIRD DOWN.
THE BILLS HAVE THEIR OWN
PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF
DEFENSIVE INJURIES.
OLIVER AND MATT MILANO ARE
BOTH OUT.
TWO KEY STARTERS.
KIRK: TWO KEY STARTERS.
IN THE MIDDLE, SANDERS, TAKE
ONE JONES.
HE LED THE BILLS DEFENSE
LAST YEAR IN TACKLES WITH
MILANO OUT SO HE HAS A LOT
OF EXPERIENCE.
AL: UNDER THE GUN.
THIRD DOWN AND FOUR.
TO THE OUTSIDE, TUA, AND THE
CATCH IS MADE RIGHT AT THE
MARKER.
TYREEK HILL COVERED BY
BINFORD.
ITS A FIRST DOWN.
KIRK: WHAT A BATTLE INTO THE
BOUNDARY.
HE IS GOING UP AGAINST THE
QUICKEST RECEIVER IN THE
NFL.
TYREEK HILL WITH A SLIPPERY
MOVE TO THE INSIDE, WORKS TO
THE OUTSIDE AND THEN THE
FINGERTIP CATCHING TWO FEET
DOWN.
GREAT LOOK.
THEY GET THE LONG RUN
BACK, PICK UP THE FIRST
DOWN.
ACHANE IN THE BACKFIELD.
TUA FAKES.
THE NEW GOES ACHANE AND HE
GOES DOWN -- THEN IT GOES
ACHANE AND HE GOES DOWN THE
SIDELINE.
JULIAN HILL, TIGHT END,
MAKES THE BLOCK.
KIRK: FLASHING TO THE
SCREEN.
WATCH TUAS REACTION.
NOW YOU GET THE DEFENSE TO
MOVE, HESITATE.
THAT IS ALL YOU WANT TO DO.
GET INTO HESITATE A BIT.
YOU HAVE THE ESCORT SCREEN
ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH
JULIAN HILL OUT IN FRONT.
AL: FROM THE 21.
GORDON NOW IN THE BACKFIELD.
GIVE IT TO HIM.
TO THE LEFT SIDE.
SO THE DOLPHINS HAVE BEEN
PLAYING FROM BEHIND.
GOT KILLED IN THE OPENER
AGAINST INDIANAPOLIS.
LAST WEEK, HAD TO FIGHT FROM
BEHIND.
THEY WERE DOWN 12-0 EARLY
AGAINST NEW ENGLAND.
KIRK: THAT IS SUCH A GREAT
POINT.
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT REALLY
BEEN ABLE TO RUN THE
FOOTBALL.
THIS IS A TEAM THAT PRIDES
ITSELF ON RUNNING THAT
OUTSIDE ZONE, RUNNING THE
FOOTBALL, TO SET UP A
RHYTHMIC PLAY-ACTION PASS
GAME.
THEY JUST HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE
TO DO THAT BUT OFF
TO A GREAT START TONIGHT.
AL: THE ROOKIE FROM OKLAHOMA
STATE STAYS IN AT
RUNNING BACK.
ITS CAUGHT.
LOOKING FOR SOME ROOM.
WASHINGTON GETS INSIDE THE
10 AND ANOTHER FIRST DOWN.
BUT THE FLAG IS DOWN.
COMING BACK.
INELIGIBLE PLAYER
DOWNFIELD, NUMBER 71.
FIVE YARD PENALTY.
REPLAY.
AL: THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE LINE,
KION SMITH.
KIRK: THAT IS PART OF THIS
OFFENSIVE LINE UP TO THIS
POINT.
THEY HAVE HAD PRETTY GOOD
SYMMETRY, PLAYING TOGETHER.
ITS A GREAT PLAN THE STAFF
HAS PUT TOGETHER.
GET A LOOK AT HIM RIGHT
HERE.
HE GETS DOWNFIELD.
HES FOUR OR FIVE YARDS
DOWNFIELD.
SO ITS THE FIRST SET BACK
IN THIS OPENING DRIVE.
AL: WOULD HAVE BEEN A FIRST
AND GOAL.
INSTEAD ITS A SECOND AND
12.
TO THE OUTSIDE.
ACHANE WITH SOME ROOM.
HES CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN.
SO SECOND AND 12.
THEY ARE GOING TO SPOT HIM
ABOUT A YARD SHY.
THIRD AND ONE COMING.
KIRK: THIS MIAMI OFFENSE, IT
IS NOT JUST TYREEK HILL IN
JAYLEN WADDLE -- AND JAYLEN
WADDLE.
ACHANE IS 511" AT 190
POUNDS BUT HE BRINGS SPEED
AND A GREAT INSTINCTIVE
BACK.
HES ABLE TO FEEL IT AND
THEN BOUNCE TO THE OUTSIDE
AND ACCELERATE UPFIELD AND
GET A SHOT AT ABOUT THIRD
AND FOUR.
AL: GORDON IS THE RUNNING
BACK.
SEVENTH PLAY OF THE OPENING
DRIVE.
THE ROOKIE TAKES IT.
GORDON TO THE FOUR YARD
LINE.
FIRST DOWN AND GOAL FOR
MIAMI.
KIRK: I WILL TELL YOU WHAT.
WE CAME INTO THIS GAME
WONDERING HOW THIS OFFENSIVE
LINE IN A SHORT WEEK IN A
HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT WITH
WATER NEW STARTERS WOULD
RESPOND.
LOOK AT THE MOVEMENT AT
THIRD AND SHORT.
MOVING PEOPLE AROUND WITHOUT
HAVING ED OLIVER IN THE
INTERIOR.
THEY ARE ABLE TO CONTROL THE
LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND GET
THE BIG FELLOW THE FOOTBALL.
THEY GOT SOME POSITIVE
YARDS.
AL: GORDON STAYING IN ON
FIRST AND GOAL.
TAKES IT AGAIN BUT SLIPS
BEFORE HE GETS TO THE LINE
OF SCRIMMAGE.
SECOND DOWN AND GOAL FIVE
MINUTES INTO THE GAME.
DOLPHINS ARE LOOKING LIKE A
TEAM THAT IS SICK ABOUT HOW
BAD THEY ARE.
AL: KIRK: KIRK: THAT IS WHAT
THEY SAID IN THE OPEN.
YOU SHOW UP WITH A CHIP IN
YOUR SHOULDER PATCH ON YOUR
SHOULDER AND COME OUT
SWINGING
-- WITH A CHIP ON YOUR
SHOULDER AND COME OUT
SWINGING.
MCDANIELS HAS THE RIGHT
MINDSET.
HE SAID WE HAVE TO WIN WITH
MARGIN.
WE CANNOT KICK FIELD GOALS.
WE HAVE TO GET TOUCHDOWNS IF
WE WANT TO BEAT JOSH ALLEN
IN THE BILLS HERE.
AL: A TIGHT FORMATION.
TUA BACKING, THROWING, TO
THE OUTSIDE, TRYING TO FIGHT
HIS WAY TO THE GOAL LINE IS
MALIKA WASHINGTON.
HE IS POPPED THAT TIME BY
TERREL BERNARD TO SAVE A
TOUCHDOWN AT THE 1-YARD
LINE, MAYBE JUST SHORT OF
THE ONE.
KIRK: HES LOOKING AT TYREEK
HILL TRYING TO WORK INTO THE
MIDDLE.
SO HE JUST CHECKS IT DOWN.
BUT AGAIN, THERE IS SOME
SPACE THERE.
CAME PRETTY CLOSE.
GOOD JOB BY THE SAFETY TO
KEEP THEM OUT OF THE END
ZONE.
AL: THIRD AND GOAL.
THIS IS THE 10TH PLAY OF
MIAMIS OPENING DRIVE.
KIRK: GORDON, THE ROOKIE,
THE BIG BACK, 225 BEHIND THE
QUARTERBACK.
AL: INTO RIGHT AT THE TWO.
AGAIN, GORDON, PUNCHING
FORWARD.
HES IN.
SO THE MIAMI DOLPHINS NOT
GIVING VERY MUCH -- NOT
GIVEN VERY MUCH OF A CHANCE
IN THIS GAME SAYING HOLD ON
JUST A SECOND.
KIRK: I THINK YOU AND I ARE
THINKING AND SAYING THE SAME
THING.
THIS IS A TEAM THAT SHOWED
UP IN A BAD MOOD AND THIS IS
REALLY WHAT THEY HAVE NOT
HAD, A POWER BACK.
THIS ROOKIE, ALI GORDON,
THEY CHALLENGED HIM TO LOSE
SOME WEIGHT, BE THERE SHORT,
AND HE DEFINITELY SHOWED UP
TONIGHT.
A COUPLE TIMES, HE GOT HIS
HANDS ON THE FOOTBALL.
TUA DOES A GREAT JOB LEADING
THIS TEAM.
THE BIG KICKOFF RETURN TO
SET THE TONE AND THEY TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF IT AND PUT
SEVEN POINTS ON THE BOARD.
AL: RILEY PATTERSON MOVES IT
THROUGH.
SO 95 TIMES MORE TO BUILD
THAT ONE.
KIRK: NO PRESSURE.
IT JUST BETTER BE
STATE-OF-THE-ART, FANTASTIC.
I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE WHAT
THAT WILL BE NEXT YEAR.
AL: MEANWHILE, RUNNING IT
BACK FROM THE GOAL LINE IS
BRANDON.
AND HERE COMES ALLEN FOR THE
FIRST TIME TONIGHT.
GREAT NIGHT ON OPENING
NIGHT.
67 TOUCHDOWNS.
AND OF COURSE WON THE M.V.P.
LAST YEAR.
KIRK: YOU WERE LOOKING AT
JOSH ALLEN.
THERE WAS A PLAY AFTER THE
WHISTLE, A PENALTY.
IT WILL BE ON THE BILLS.
THEY ARE ALREADY MOVING
BACK.
AFTER THE PLAY WAS OVER,
PERSONAL FOUL, UNNECESSARY
ROUGHNESS, NUMBER 85.
FIRST DOWN, BUFFALO.
AL: JACKSON HAWES.
KIRK: THAT IS UNLIKE WHAT
MIAMI DID WITH THE BIG
RETURN.
JOSH ALLEN WILL START AT HIS
BIG -- AT HIS OWN 15 YARD
LINE.
AL: TO SEAN MCDERMOTT.
HIS PEDIGREE IS DEFENSE.
OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR IS JOE
BRADY.
AND HERE WE GO WITH THE
BILLS FIRST PLAY.
A PUMP FAKE AND A PASS DOWN
THE SIDELINE.
INCOMPLETE.
ALMOST ONE-HANDED BY COLEMAN
BUT THERES A FLAG ON THIS
PLAY.
JACK JONES WITH THE
COVERAGE.
AND THE BILLS ARE MOVING UP
AHEAD.
KIRK: THIS IS A BIG PART OF
TONIGHTS GAME.
THE QUARTERBACK POSITION OF
THE DOLPHINS.
NUMBER 23, FOUL.
AUTOMATIC.
KIRK: WE HAVE FOUR CORNERS
OUT TONIGHT FOR MIAMI.
SO JACK JONES, WHO SIGNED
WITH THE DOLPHINS IN THE LIE
-- IN JULY, STARTING ON ONE
SIDE.
DOUGLAS JUST SIGNED A FEW
WEEKS AGO ON THE OTHER SIDE.
AL: 20 YARD PENALTY, FIRST
DOWN.
AND THE 35 YARD LINE.
ALLEN HANGS IN.
THE PAST IS CAUGHT.
THAT TIME IT IS JAMES COOK
OUT OF THE BACKFIELD.
ALREADY ESTABLISHED AS ONE
OF THE BEST RUNNING BACKS IN
THE NFL.
HAD A GREAT SUNDAY DOWN IT
MADE LIFE -- DOWN AT METLIFE
AGAINST THE JETS.
KIRK: I REALLY THINK HES
ONE OF THE MOST OVERSHADOWED
SUPERSTARS IN THE NFL AND I
THINK IT IS BECAUSE OF JOSH
ALLEN.
YOU KNOW, HE DOES SUCH A
GOOD JOB IN SOME A DIFFERENT
AREAS FOR THIS OFFENSE.
AL: THEY GO WITH THREE
TITANS.
ITS A FORMATION THEY HAVE
BEEN USING VERY OFTEN OF
LATE.
HERE IS COOK.
BREAKS IT INTO DOLPHIN
TERRITORY.
SECOND DOWN AT THE 44 YARD
LINE.
ITS OFF TO THE RACES AGAIN.
KIRK: YOU TALKED ABOUT THE
THREE TIGHT ENDS.
THEY KNOW THE VISION AND THE
PATIENTS OF JAMES COOK.
HE BOUNCES IT OFF AND THEN
BOUNCES TO THE BACKSIDE.
WITH HIS SPEED YOU BETTER
HOLD ONTO YOUR HAT.
COMING UP WITH THREE
AGAIN.
SEVEN MINUTES TO GO IN THE
QUARTER.
COOK AGAIN.
HE CAN EXPLOIT THE SMALLNESS
OF HOLES -- THE SMALLEST OF
HOLES.
THAT ONE FOR 11.
KIRK: THEY GET INTO THAT,
ITS PRETTY OBVIOUS, 12 OF
13 SNAPS, THEY RUN THE
FOOTBALL.
THEY LET YOU KNOW WE ARE
GOING TO RUN THE BALL AND
CAN YOU STAND UP TO THEM?
THIS IS WHAT WE SAW LAST
WEEK IN THEIR GAME WHERE
THEY DECIDED TO GET PHYSICAL
AND RUN THE FOOTBALL AGAINST
THE JETS.
JOSH ALLEN DIDNT HAVE TO DO
MUCH.
THEY JUST BEAT THEM UP UP
FRONT.
AL: 224 YARDS LAST SUNDAY.
CALLED HIS NUMBER AGAIN.
THIS TIME TO THE 30.
WE GO TO KAYLEE.
KAYLEE: YOU WILL SEE JOSH
ALLEN WEARING A VISOR ON HIS
HELMET TONIGHT.
IT IS FOR PROTECTION AFTER
HE GOT POPPED IN THE FACE
SUNDAY.
HIS NOSE WAS BLEEDING
PROFUSELY EVEN THOUGH HE
ONLY MISSED TWO PLAYS.
HE PRACTICED WITH IT ALL
THIS WEEK AND TOLD US HE
WORE A VISOR THROUGH COLLEGE
AND ADMITTED HE JUST DID IT
FOR SWAG BACK THEN AND WHEN
HE GOT TO THE LEAGUE DIDNT
WANT TO BE THE ROOKIE TRYING
TO LOOK COOL BUT TONIGHT HE
NEEDS IT.
AL: UNIVERSITY OF WYOMING,
FIRST ROUND PICK BACK IN
2018.
NOW RAY DAVIS IS IN
THE BACKFIELD.
SECOND DOWN AND SEVEN.
IN MOTION.
THE PASS IS CAUGHT.
THATS A FIRST DOWN AS ITS
TAKEN DOWN BY DALTON
KINCAID.
SO THEY HAVE THOSE THREE
TIGHT ENDS, KINKADE, KNOX
AND HAWES.
KIRK: GREAT JOB OF SHOWING
PATIENTS.
THEY ARE MIXING UP THEIR
GROUPINGS.
AND YOU SEE JOSH ALLEN NOT
TRYING TO FORCE THE BALL
DOWNFIELD.
JUST CHECK IT, TAKE WITH
THE DEFENSE IS GIVING HIM.
AL: NOW TY JOHNSON COMES IN
AT RUNNING BACK.
REGGIE GILLIAM COMES IN AT
FULLBACK.
PLAY CLOCK AT 2:00.
JOHNSON GETS TO THE 27.
NOT ONLY DID THEY HAVE THE
THREE TIGHT ENDS BUT THE
FULLBACK ON TOP OF IT.
KIRK: JOE BRADY, THE
OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, HE
MIXES UP A LOT OF LOOKS.
I REALLY FEEL THAT HE HAS A
CHANCE -- YOU KNOW HOW BEN
JOHNSON BECAME THE OFFENSIVE
COORDINATOR OF THE NFL.
IF THE BILLS STAY HEALTHY
AND JOSH ALLEN HAS ANOTHER
IN VP TYPE OF SEASON, A LOT
OF PEOPLE -- ANOTHER M.V.P.
TYPE OF SEASON, A LOT OF
PEOPLE WILL START TO LOOK AT
JOE BRADY.
HES THAT KIND OF GUY.
HE WILL DO EVERYTHING HE CAN
TONIGHT TO MIX UP THE LOOKS.
AL: THEY WENT FROM TIGHT TO
FIVE RECEIVERS IN THIS
PATTERN.
ALLEN THROWS TO THE
SIDELINE.
OPEN, REACHING FOR IT,
MAKING THE GRAB AND INTO THE
END ZONE.
DALTON KINCAID WITH A
TOUCHDOWN.
WELL, THAT DID NOT TAKE
LONG.
85 YARDS, SEVEN PLAYS.
KIRK: AND, AL, WATCH HOW HE
BRINGS KINKADE BACK.
HE THINK HES GOT TO KEEP
GOING UP FIELD.
INSTEAD, THE BALL
BRINGS HIM BACK.
HE DOES WELL OUT IN FRONT OF
HIM TO MAKE THE CATCH
SHORTHANDED.
IT MISSED HIM LAST YEAR WITH
THAT KNEE INJURY.
LOOKS LIKE HE IS BACK
FEELING BETTER TO GO ALONG
WITH KNOX AND HAWES.
AL: MATT PRATER KICKED THE
GAME-WINNING FIELD GOAL
PREVIOUSLY.
AT 41, HE BOOSTED THROUGH
FOR THE EXTRA-- A BILLS LOVE STORY.
SOME OF THE BILLS WILL HAVE
A CAMEO OR EVEN MORE IN THAT
ONE.
SO EACH TEAM SCORING ON ITS
FIRST DRIVE.
MALIKA WASHINGTON -- PASS TO
THE 33.
KIRK: AMAZING DRIVE BY THE
DOLPHINS.
THEY CAME OUT AND REALLY
LEANED ON THAT OFFENSIVE
LINE, WHICH WE HAVE SOME
QUESTIONS ABOUT BUT IT WAS A
GOOD MIX.
, SOME QUICK THROWS AND ABLE
TO RUN THE BALL.
FIRST DOWN, MIAMI.
THIS IS WHAT WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT.
THEY CAME IN ON A SHORT
WEEK.
HOW IS TUA GOING TO HANDLE
THIS?
ABLE TO GET THAT DOWN TO
ACHANE AND GET AN EXTRA OUT
IN FRONT.
WE HAVE NOT SEEN THIS IN
THESE FIRST TWO WEEKS.
THEY HAD SLOW STARTS AGAINST
THE COLTS AND PATRIOTS.
15 YARDS AGAINST THE COLTS.
THEY HAD 52 YARDS AND A
TOUCHDOWN IN THE FIRST
DRIVE.
LETS SEE IF THEY CAN FOLLOW
THAT GREAT DRIVE UP HERE,
BACKED UP AFTER A PENALTY.
AL: TUA IN THE PISTOL.
QUICK THROW, INCOMPLETE.
GOES
WASHINGTONS WAY AGAIN.
THEY ARE USING HIM QUITE A
LOT OUT -- LOT TONIGHT.
KIRK: EXPECTING THE BILLS TO
MIX SOME THINGS UP.
HE HAD PLENTY OF TIME BACK
THERE.
BACK TO THROW.
AL: CLOGGED UP THE MIDDLE,
MAKING THE THROW TO THE
OUTSIDE.
RUNNING TO THE TRACK.
GOING OUT FOR FIVE IS
ACHANE.
THIRD DOWN AND FIVE.
KIRK: THEY WILL COME DOWN TO
THE PROTECTION.
THE BILLS ARE GOING TO BRING
PRESSURE, RELY ON THEIR EDGE
TO GET THERE.
WE WILL SEE HOW THE DOLPHINS
HAVE ENOUGH TIME.
I THINK THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE
THEIR RECEIVERS CAN WIN.
AL: HE SEES JOEY BOSA.
THIRD AND FIVE.
THEY SCORED.
THEY CAN ONLY PICK UP A
COUPLE.
CAM LEWIS STOPS AND THEIR
EDITS FOURTH DOWN.
IT MAY HAVE AFFECTED HIM.
ARE THEY DROPPING?
ALSO TRYING TO GET A FEEL OF
WHETHER THAT PRESSURE IS
COMING.
IT AFFECTED HIM BEING ABLE
TO SECURE THE FOOTBALL.
CALLED EXACTLY.
HERE IS BAILEYS PICK.
GOOD ONE DOWN THEE 23
YARD LINE.
AND HE WILL BRING THAT BACK
TO THE 37 YARD SINCE
1973.
THE BILLS CAME INTO THE
AMERICAN FOOTBALL LEAGUE AS
AN ORIGINAL FRANCHISE BACK
IN 1960.
WE START THIS DRIVE.
A HANDOFF HERE.
ANOTHER NICE RUN FOR JAMES
COOK.
FOURTH YEAR OUT OF GEORGIA.
PICKS UP A TOTAL HERE OF
NINE YARDS.
SECOND AND 1.
KIRK: GOOD JOB OF GILLIAM,
THE FULLBACK, WHICH GETS
OVERLOOKED BECAUSE WE TALKED
SO MUCH ABOUT THE THREE
TIGHT ENDS, BUT WHEN YOU
HAVE THESE MANY PIECES AT
YOUR DISPOSAL AS AN
OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, WHEN
YOU HAVE A QUARTERBACK THAT
CAN HANDLE IT, IT PUTS SO
MUCH ON A DEFENSE TO DEAL
WITH, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU
HAVE A SHORT WEEK TO TRY TO
PREP.
AL: JOHNSON, THE RUNNING
BACK.
IN THIS TIME, AROUND -- AND
THIS TIME, AROUND, ELIJAH
MOORE PICKS UP THE FIRST
DOWN AND A FEW MORE.
THATS A GAIN OF 11 YARDS
WITH 1:30 IN THE QUARTER.
KIRK: HE SWEEPS TO GET HIM
OUT OF THE AD FROM LEFT TO
RIGHT.
WATCH HOW QUICKLY THEY ARE
ABLE TO GET OUTSIDE AND
OUTFLANK THIS DEFENSE.
AGAIN, YOU LOOK AT THE
TOTALITY OF THIS OFFENSE AND
HOW THE ATTACK.
ITS THE INTERIOR RUN WITH
JADEN COOK.
THE PLAY ACTION PASS GAME
AND ALL THE DIFFERENT LOOKS,
THE MOTIONS.
KIRK: COOK BACK IN.
FAKE TO HIM.
FIRED IN THE MIDDLE, INTO
TRAFFIC.
PERFECTLY TO KINKADE FOR A
FIRST DOWN.
WHEN YOU ARE A LINEBACKER,
YOUR EYES ARE IN THIS
BACKFIELD AND YOU WORRY
ABOUT RUNNING THE FOOTBALL
WITH JAMES COOK.
IF THEY ARE I HAVE TO GET
DOWNHILL AND MAKE A PLAY.
NOW IT IS PLAY ACTION.
SO NOW THE BILLS JUST ONE
STEP AHEAD OF THIS DOLPHINS
DEFENSE.
AL: FINAL MINUTE OF THE
QUARTER.
FIRST DOWN, FROM THE 31 YARD
LINE.
BACK TO JOHNSON.
PICKS UP ABOUT FOUR.
SECOND DOWN AND 6.
THE TACKLE THERE BY ASHTYN
DAVIS COULD BE THE FINAL
PLAY OF THE QUARTER.
KIRK: COULD BE TOUGH FOR
MIAMI IF ANTHONY WEAVER
WANTS THIS DEFENSE TO PLAY
IS 11.
THE FIRST TWO WEEKS, THEY
LOOK LIKE A TEAM THAT HAS
NOT PLAYED INSPIRED
FOOTBALL.
TONIGHT, THIS WHAT THEY ARE
TRYING TO DO.
AL: CAN THEY GET A PLAYOFF
IN THE WANING SECONDS?
THEY CANNOT.
IT IS THE END OF THE
QUARTER.
TO FIND MARK AFTER
THIS SEASON.
AL MICHAELS, KIRK
HERBSTREIT, KAYLEE
HARTUNG.
BUFFALO STARTING THE SECOND
QUARTER.
THIS TIME COOK KEEPS THOSE
LEGS DRIVING.
TURNS A 1-YARD GAIN INTO A
3-YARD GAIN.
KIRK: HES A TOUGH RUNNER.
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT JOSH
ALLEN AND HOW HE HAS CHANGED
HIS THROWING MECHANICS SINCE
HIS ROOKIE YEAR, NOW WORKING
WITH CHRIS HESS, WHO IS AN
EXPERT IN BIOMECHANICS.
IT IS ABOUT CREATING FORCE
AND POWER FROM THE GROUND
UP, SEQUENCE HE WITH THE
HIPS.
THE HAND AND THE ARM IS KIND
OF A GPS.
THAT IS WHY HIS CONSISTENCY
AND ACCURACY IS SO MUCH
BETTER THESE LAST THREE OR
FOUR YEARS.
IT CHANGED FOR HIM IN 2020.
THAT WAS THE GAME CHANGER
FOR HAVING HIM DO THAT.
AL: THIRD AND 2.
HERE IS COOK.
PICKS UP THE FIRST.
IT IS ALMOST SIMILAR TO A
DOWNSWING IN SOME WAYS.
AND ALLEN LOVES IT.
HES PRETTY GOOD.
KIRK: HE IS.
WE WERE TALKING TO HIM THIS
WEEK ABOUT HIS MECHANICS AND
HE IS ADDICTED TO IT AND HE
IS A BIG GOLFER APPEARED --
BIG GOLFER.
HE SAYS ANYTHING THAT IS
ROTATION, WHETHER YOU ARE A
PITCHER, A QUARTERBACK, A
GOLFER, EVERYONE FRAMES THAT
WAY.
AL: HES LOOKING FOR A
BETTER GAME.
THATS ABOUT ALL.
FROM THE 18 YARD LINE.
ALLEN TO THE END ZONE AND
DROPPED.
AND THAT TIME IT IS KINCAID.
COVERED BY ASHTYN DAVIS.
ALMOST HAD HIS SECOND
TOUCHDOWN OF THE NIGHT.
KIRK: IF THE MATCHUPS.
THEY WANT TO GET THESE TIGHT
ENDS MATCHED UP AGAINST A
SAFETY WHERE HE HAS
ADVANTAGE WITH THE SIZE.
KINCAID REALLY HAS WIDE
RECEIVER SKILLS.
GOOD JOB BY DAVIS NOT GIVING
UP THE PLAY, NOT GIVING IT
UP.
BUT HE GOT THAT LEFT HAND IN
THERE AT THE END TO BE ABLE
TO KNOCK THAT FOOTBALL AWAY.
GOOD EFFORT BY THE SAFETY.
AL: SECOND DOWN AND 10 NOW.
ALLENS FIRST AND
COMPLETION.
HES FOUR OUT OF FIVE.
HITS IT AWAY QUICKLY.
CAUGHT, TO THE 10, LOOKING
FOR THE FIRST DOWN, COMES UP
A LITTLE SHORT.
SHAKIR.
SETS UP A THIRD DOWN AND 2.
KIRK: THEY SAY EVERYBODY
EATS.
THAT HAS BEEN THE MOTTO OF
THIS OFFENSE.
STEPH DIGGS MOVED ON.
THEY REALLY DONT HAVE THAT
SUPERSTAR AT RECEIVER.
THEY WORK AS A GROUP.
THEY ARE NOT WORKING TO GIVE
ONE GUY THE BALL.
THEY LET THE OFFENSE AND
DEFENSE DICTATE WHO WILL BE
OPEN, FIND THE OPEN MAN AND
THAT IS WHO YOU WILL THROW
TO.
AL: SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW
WITH THE PACKERS LAST WEEK.
WHO WAS NUMBER ONE?
EIGHT OR NINE GUYS WHO CAN
CATCH IT.
QUICK PASS HERE.
CAUGHT.
THATS A FIRST DOWN.
IT IS KEON COLEMAN.
KIRK: THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT
TO SEE FROM HIM.
WE SAW THIS IN THE FOURTH
QUARTER AGAINST BALTIMORE.
THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT TO
SEE.
HES A BIG BODY AT 64", 214
POUNDS.
AND A GREAT JOB, USING THE
HANDS AND THE STRENGTH TO BE
ABLE TO SECURE THAT FOOTBALL
TO GIVE HIM THIS FIRST AND
GOAL.
AL: 10TH PLAY OF THIS DRIVE.
FIRST AND GOAL.
AND ALLEN DOES NOT LIKE WHAT
HE SEES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF
THIS AND WE WILL TAKE A
TIMEOUT.
YOU KNOW, SOME TEAMS ARE
GOOD, AND THEY ARE NOT
PARTICULARLY INTERESTING.
THE BUFFALO BILLS HAVE
REALLY BECOME A GREAT TEAM
TO WATCH.
KIRK: YEAH.
YOU BRING UP GREEN BAY AND
IT DOES KIND OF REMIND YOU,
AS FAR AS THE WAY THEY USE
DIFFERENT PIECES, YOU DONT
HAVE THAT ONE GUY.
WHAT A CHALLENGE TO GET
READY FOR THIS OFFENSE AND
ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS THEY
CAN ATTACK YOU, ALL THE
DIFFERENT LOOKS THAT THEY
GIVE YOU, AND YOU HAVE A
MIAMI DEFENSE THAT HAD A
SHORT WEEK.
THEY STRUGGLED IN THEIR
FIRST TWO GAMES AND NOW HAVE
TO GO AGAINST JOSH ALLEN,
WHERE IF THEY GET A STOP,
ITS A GOOD JOB.
JUST TRYING TO GET A STOP TO
SLOW DOWN THIS OFFENSE.
AL: ABSOLUTELY.
THATS ENTERTAINMENT.
YOU WATCH THE BUFFALO BILLS,
THEY ARE A DRAW.
AND OF COURSE EVERYBODY HERE
IS THINKING ABOUT ONE THING,
CAN?WE GET TO
FEBRUARY FIRST AND GOAL.
KIRK: ANDERSON.
THEY ARE GOING HEAVY TO THE
LEFT EAR.
AL: OFF THE FAKE, ROLLING.
HE CAN RUN IF HE HAS TO.
INSTEAD HE FLIPS IT FOR THE
TOUCHDOWN.
HE HITS JACKSON HAWES, THEIR
NUMBER THREE TIGHT END.
ROLLING AGAINST THE GRAIN.
COULD HE RUN?
SAW HE WAS BETTER OFF TRYING
TO FLIP IT, WHICH HE DOES
WITH A TOUCHDOWN.
KIRK: HE GETS OUTSIDE, YOU
KNOW WHAT HE CAN DO WITH HIS
FEET.
THERE IS HAWES, BY THE WAY,
IN MOTION.
HE WILL GO BACK AND WORK HIS
WAY BACK THE OTHER WAY.
IF 17 GETS OUT ON THE EDGE
YOU BETTER GET READY.
THEN A LITTLE FLICK THERE
AND A NICE TOUCHDOWN PASS.
IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF
COVERAGE, HE DEBATED THE
DEFENSE TO BE ABLE TO GET
THAT FLIP FOR THE TOUCHDOWN.
AL: WHO IS JACKSON HAWES?
Not checking the jumbotron,
not smart.
JUSTICES.
KIRK: THEY HAVE EVERYTHING
COVERED.
AL: MIAMI TO RECEIVE RIGHT
NOW.
MATT PRATER.
TYLER BASS GOT HURT.
BACK AT THE 5-YARD LINE BY
ESKRIDGE.
AFTER THAT KAYLEE REPORT, IN
THE BOOTH NOW, OHIO STATE,
ARIZONA STATE.
WE WERE TALKING TO MCDANIEL
THE OTHER DAY.
HES KIND OF QUIRKY AND
IDIOSYNCRATIC.
WE KNOW THAT.
I ASKED HIM ABOUT HIS
PLAYING CAREER AT YALE.
WHAT WAS THE HIGHLIGHT?
HE SAID ON THE SIDELINE,
INTERRUPTING.
PERFECT.
KIRK: COULD NOT HAVE
SCRIPTED THAT ANY BETTER.
AL: 185 POUND WIDE RECEIVER
FOR THE BULLDOGS.
NOW IN HIS FOURTH YEAR AS
THE HEAD COACH.
OLLIE GORDON IS THE
RUNNING BACK AS THEY START
THIS DRIVE.
TUA ROLLING.
LOOKING, THROWING ALONG THE
SIDELINE.
CHASED BY JOEY BOSA, WHO
AFTER NINE YEARS WITH THE
CHARGERS HAS THIS SEASON.
KIRK: THEY STARTED WELL AND
HAD SUCH GOOD RHYTHM WITH
THAT OPENING DRIVE.
YOU SEE HOW TUA AND THIS
OFFENSE CAN RESPOND.
TUA HIMSELF DID NOT HAVE A
GREAT SECOND DRIVE, DROPPED
THAT THIRD DOWN SNAP.
HE TOOK HIS EYES OFF THE
FOOTBALL.
THEY WILL HAVE A HARD TIME
STOPPING JOSH ALLEN.
EVERY POSSESSION COUNTS FOR
TUA IN THIS OFFENSE.
AL: QUICK FLIP.
ACHAN.
AND GETS WHACKED AFTER A
GAIN OF 1.
BERNARD IS THERE.
KIRK: A DIFFERENCE IN THE
OPENING DRIVE IN WHAT YOU
SEE HERE IN THE LAST
COUPLE IS THEY'RE
CRANKING UP THE PRESSURE
A LITTLE BIT MORE.
THEY'RE TRYING TO AFFECT
HIM.
NOT LET HIM HAVE TIME
LIKE HE DID ON THAT
OPENING DRIVE ESPECIALLY
WHEN THEY GET IT TO THIRD
DOWN.
THIS IS WHERE THEY'D LIKE
TO GET CREATIVE.
AL: THIRD AND 9.
TUA IN THE POCK.
FLUSHED.
THROWS TOWARDS THE
SIDELINE.
AND THAT IS INCOMPLETE.
ACHAN, THE INTENDED
RECEIVER.
KIRK: HE'S NOT AS
EFFECTIVE ON THE MOVE.
HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT
X-FACTOR LIKE JOSH ALLEN
AND SOME OF THE OTHERS.
NOT HIS STRENGTH.
THIS TIME HE GIVES THE
RECEIVER THE SHOT.
GOOD TIGHT COVERAGE
DOWNFIELD.
AL: BAILEY'S SECOND
PUNT.
IT'S ALMOST BLOCKED.
AL: TOTALLY.
TOTALLY.
ALLEN AT THE 27-YARD LINE
TO START THIS DRIVE.
HE IS 7-8 FOR 64 YARDS.
OFFOFF THE FEINT.
AND HE IS SLUNG DOWN.
KIRK, BACK IN THE 1970'S
WHEN MIAMI HAD THE GREAT
TEAMS, THE UNDEFEATED
TEAM WON TWO SUPER
BOWLS.
THEY WERE FOR THE DECADE
20-0 AGAINST BUFFALO.
KIRK: WOW!
AL: THREW A BAGEL AT
THEM.
KIRK: IT'S CALL PAYBACK
WITH JOSH ALLEN.
MADE THE ADJUSTMENTS
THROUGH THE DEFENSIVE
STAFF.
TALKING ABOUT PRESSURING
AND -- RATHER THE
OFFENSIVE STAFF TRYING TO
HELP TUA AND GIVE HIM
SOME TIME.
YOU DON'T SEE A TON OF
THIS THROUGHOUT THE
LEAGUE.
11TH SNAP UNDER CENTER
ALREADY.
AL: SECOND AND 4.
VERY BALANCED OFFENSE.
THERE HE GOES.
BREAKS A TACKLE.
INSIDE THE 45-YARD LINE.
SEVEN CARRIES FOR 74
YARDS FOR NUMBER 4 --
FOUR.
KIRK: THIS IS GIVING
MIAMI SOME OF THEIR OWN
MEDICINE.
OFFENSE IS LEFT.
OUTSIDE ZONE PLAY.
GOOD JOB BY SAVERS, THE
RECEIVER THAT COMES IN TO
BLOCK.
DAWKINS, 73.
AND A GREAT FEEL BY JAMES
COOK JUST KIND OF BEING
PATIENT, SETTING IT UP
AND THEN ACCELERATING
ONCE HE HITS THAT
CREASE.
AL: NOW RAY DAVIS IN AT
RUNNING BACK.
HAS TIME.
LOSE THAT FLIP AGAIN.
HE'S IN LOVE WITH THAT
FOR THE MOMENT.
INTENDED THERE FOR
DAVIS.
IT'S INCOMPLETE.
DODSON COVERING.
SECOND DOWN.
KIRK: AGAIN, THAT'S JUST
A QUARTERBACK THAT FEELS
AND CEASE IT.
STEPPED OUT OF THE
POCKET.
WITH HIS VISION, YOU JUST
NEVER KNOW.
YOU KNOW, AS A DEFENDER,
YOU BETTER STAY PLASTERED
ON EVERY SINGLE RECEIVER
THAT'S DOWNFIELD.
THIS TIME IT'S DAVIS TO
BACK.
YOU MIGHT GET ANOTHER
FLIP LIKE THAT.
HECK OF A PLAY BY DODSON
FROM GETTING TO DAVIS.
AL: KICK PASS HERE.
COLEMAN.
ABOUT A YARD SHY OF THE
FIRST DOWN.
ALLEN HAS STARTED 9-11
FOR 79 YARDS, TWO
TOUCHDOWNS.
THIRD AND 1.
KIRK: WE TALKED THIS
ENTIRE FIRST HALF OF JOE
BRADY AND THE MIXING OF
DIFFERENT GROUPS AND
GETTING DIFFERENT
PERSONNEL GROUPINGS.
THE REASON I BRING IN
UNDER CENTER IS THAT'S
ANOTHER PIECE TO WHAT HE
LIKES TO.
DO YOU GET JAMES COOK
DOTTING AN I AND WORKING
DOWNHILL.
MIRRORING THAT LOOK WITH
PLAY ACTION WITH JOSH
ALLEN.
AL: OFF THE FAKE.
PASS IS CAUGHT ON THE
OUTSIDE.
THAT'S THE FIRST DOWN.
SHAVERS MAKE HIS FIRST
CATCH OF THE NIGHT.
BRADY HAS GOT TO HAVE FUN
WITH ALL THESE TOYS, A
TIGHT END AND THREE
RUNNING BACKS AND OF
COURSE, JOSH ALLEN.
KIRK: THEY USE MOTION AS
AN INDICATOR.
HE KNOWS THAT SHAVERS IS
GOING TO BE FREE.
HE DOESN'T FINISH HIS
DROP.
HE'S ALREADY TRYING TO
GET THE BALL OUT THERE TO
GET THE BALL TO SHAVERS
BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE'S
GOING TO OUTFLANK THE
DEFENSE.
YOU SAW THE RESPONSE AND
HOW THE ROOKIE MARSHALL
GOES WITH HIM AND IT'S
LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF A
SCREAMER, A LITTLE BIT OF
A PICK TO GET HIM OUT IN
SPACE OUT THERE TO THE
FLAP.
BUT JUST THE AWARENESS,
THE VIRK THE EIGHT YEARS
OF EXPERIENCE, HE KNEW
BEFORE HE GOT THE BALL ON
HIS HANDS WHERE IT'S
GOING TO GO AND DID IT
QUICKLY.
NOW YOU HAVE JASON
MARSHAM GOING FOR HIS
HAMSTRING.
KIRK: THIS IS A NEW
SECONDARY.
IF YOU GO BACK TO WHERE
THEY WERE A YEAR AGO,
EVEN IF THEY HAD
EVERYBODY IN THE LINEUP
THEY WOULD STILL BE
BRINGING IN A NEW GROUP.
AL: ALLEN TO THE OUTSIDE.
KIRK MAKES THAT CATCH.
TAKEN DOWN THERE BY
ASHTON DAVIS AFTER A
SHORT GAIN OF TWO.
SECOND AND 8.
KIRK: ANOTHER CALL FOR A
PLAYER DOWN.
IT'S ANOTHER CORNER JACK
JONES.
AL: SO JONES WHO THEY
PICKED UP FROM VEGAS
AFTER LAST SEASON, HERE'S
WHAT HAPPENED.
UNFRIENDLY FIRE.
KIRK: KINKAID ON A MESH
ROUTE.
LEFT SHOULDER GOT HIM
RIGHT IN THE CHEST.
AL: THAT MEANS ETHAN
BONNER, FREE AGENT OUT OF
STANFORD.
ERIKA:
KIRK: AND HE'S BEEN
DEALING WITH A HAMMY
HIMSELF.
AL: A GAIN OF THREE.
KIRK: YOU'RE GOING
AGAINST JOSH ALLEN, THESE
WEAPONS WITH THESE
CORNERS.
AL: BREAKS THAT.
GOT AWAY FROM JAELAN
PHILLIPS.
WE'RE HALFWAY THROUGH THE
QUARTER.
THIRD DOWN AND 8 AS
MARSHALL GOES BACK TO THE
LOCKER ROOM.
KIRK: THE STRENGTH OF
THIS DEFENSE IS PHILLIPS
WHO IS GREAT TO SEE HIM
BACK AFTER THE ACHILLES
IN 24 LAST YEAR WITH THE
KNEE.
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE
BRADLEY CHUB WHO HAS
DEALT WITH SOME INJURYIES.
WHEN THEY'RE HEALTHY,
THEY GOT TO WIN ON THE
OUTSIDE FOR THIS DEFENSE
ESPECIALLY RIGHT HERE.
AL: DECENT NEWS AS JACK
JONES WAS ONLY FOR ONLY
ONE PLAY.
ALLEN THE PRESSURE.
ALLEN IS GOING TO GO DOWN
TO THE 25-YARD LINE.
BRADLEY CHUBB IS THERE.
KIRK: ON CUE.
IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE
ABLE TO SLOW DOWN JOSH
ALLEN, YOU'VE GOT TO BE
ABLE TO WIN HERE AND
HERE.
AND THE FACT THAT THEY'RE
GETTING HEALTHIER, THESE
GUYS AS A TANDEM WHEN
THEY RUSH THEM BOTH IT'S
ONE WAY YOU SLIDE HERE.
YOU HAVE DAWKINS ON AN
ISLAND.
TWO VERY TALENTED TACKLES
BUT CHUBB ABLE TO GET
HOME.
AL: HE HAS A SACK IN
EVERY GAME.
THREE FOR THE SEASON.
PRATER WITH A 39-YARD
FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT.
AND THAT KICK IS NO
GOOD.
SO THE BIG HERO ON
OPENING NIGHT MISS THIS
IS ONE.
MIAMI HOLDS 14-7 IS THE
SCORE.
WE'RE BACK IN 30
AL: HOW ABOUT TAYLOR
ROOKS AND SHERMAN?
HE WAS NOTHING BUT A PRO
IN THIS ONE.
KIRK: AND THE HOLD.
AND YOU AND I NEVER
GOLFED TOGETHER.
I TELL YOU I'M TERRIBLE.
I MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD
ABOUT YOUR GAMES.
YOU NEED TO PLAY WITH ME
TO GET YOUR CONFIDENCE
UP.
BUT THAT WAS JUST A
MISS.
THE OPERATION WAS PERFECT.
SNAP, HOLD.
HE HAD THE BIG KICK
AGAINST BALTIMORE.
GREAT CAREER.
BUT HE GIVES THE DOLPHINS
LIFE HERE
AL: EXACT APPLY WHAT
MIAMI NEEDED.
TUA GOES BACK.
NOTHING HAPPENING
DOWNFIELD.
ACHANE WILL GET WRESTLED
DOWN OR STOPPED ANYWAY
AFTER A GAIN OF ABOUT
THREE.
KIRK: THE DOLPHINS TOOK
THE BALL IN THEIR OPENING
TRIBE AND BOY, THEY WERE
IN SINK.
THEY GAVE TUA SOME TIME
THEY WERE ABLE TO CONTROL
THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE
DESPITE THE INEXPERIENCE
UP FRONT.
THEY MOVED THE BALL AFTER
A BIG KICKOFF RETURN.
JUMPED OUT THE 57-0
LEAD.
AND SINCE THEN, THE BILLS
ADJUSTED AND BROUGHT MORE
PRESSURE AND THE DOLPHINS
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO
RESPOND BACK.
AL: FIGHTING.
TACKLED THERE BY
TRE'DAVIOUS WHITE.
GOOD TO SEE HIM BACK.
LONG TIME BILL.
HAD AN ACHILLES.
HAD SURGERY.
PLAYED WITH THE RAMS LAST
YEAR.
BACK HERE.
KIRK: DAWKINS, JOSH
ALLEN, A LOT OF THE BILLS
EXCITED TO HAVE HIM
BACK.
BIG PLAY HERE FOR THIS
DOLPHINS OFFENSE.
AL: THIRD DOWN AND 1.
INSIDE.
TO THE 43.
BACK TO GORDON WHO WAS
THE BIG GUY ON THAT FIRST
DRIVE.
SCORED THE TOUCHDOWN.
HE PICKS UP THE FIRST.
KIRK: THAT'S ROOKIE
AGAINST ROOKIE THERE.
HE WAS MET RIGHT AT THE
LINE OF SCRIMMAGE BY
WALKER.
THE ROOKIE OUT OF
KENTUCKY.
AND HE'S ABLE TO SHAKE
THROUGH THAT ARM TACKLE
AND PICK UP JUST ENOUGH
OF THAT FIRST DOWN.
WHAT A GREAT ADDITION.
ALL THE SPEED THEY HAVE
ALL OVER THIS OFFENSE TO
BRING IN A BIG THUMPER
LIKE THAT.
AL: 6'2", 225.
HAD A GREAT PRESEASON.
TUA TO THIS POINT HAS
ONLY THROWN NINE TIMES.
AVERAGING ONLY THREE
YARDS PER PASS.
KIRK: THIS IS AN
OFFENSE.
WE ALL KNOW ABOUT MIKE
MCDANIEL, HIS TIME AT SAN
FRANCISCO WITH KYLE
SHANAHAN.
THEY HAVE TO BE READY TO
RUN THE FOOTBALL.
THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE IN
A SITUATION WHERE TUA
LIKE THE FIRST TWO WEEKS
IS CONSTANTLY THROWING.
THAT'S WHY EVEN THOUGH
THEY'RE DOWN SEVEN, THEY
HAVE TO STICK TO YOUR
GAME PLAN AND YOUR GUNS,
AND YOUR IDENTITY.
RUN THE BALL AND SET UP
THAT PLAY ACTION.
AL: FAKE TOSS.
INTO THE OUTSIDE.
LOOK OUT.
HE'S BEEN DOING THAT SORT
OF STUFF FOR 11 YEARS.
THIRD DOWN.
KIRK: THOMPSON NEW THAT
INGOLD IS THE ESCORT.
ONE-ON-ONE HERE.
IT'S A FOOT RATES.
HE'S GOT TO BE ABLE TO
GET OUT, TO THE OUTSIDE
AND ABLE TO FINISH THE
PLAY OFF BUT IT WAS
BECAUSE HE HAD THAT
PERIPHERAL VISION OR THAT
BLOCK ALLOWED HIM TO GET
OUTSIDE OR HAVE LEVERAGE
TO FIN UNOFF THAT PLAY.
AL: EVERY TIME TUA LOOKS
DOWN THE MIDDLE, NOBODY'S
OPEN.
FLUSHED OUT AGAIN.
TOWARD THE SIDELINE AND
IT'S CAUGHT.
TYREEK HILL MAKE THE
CATCH.
KEEPS THE DRIVE ALIVE
WITH 2:30 IN THE HALF.
KIRK: THAT'S A HECK OF A
JOB BY TYREEK HILL.
HELPING OUT HIS
QUARTERBACK.
WE KNOW ABOUT HIS ABILITY
TO MAKE PLAYS.
HE SAYS I'M IN YOUR
VISION.
HE GOES WAY UP TO CLIMB
THE LADDER TO MAKE THAT
PLAY.
HOW ABOUT TUA AGAINST
THAT CORNER BLITZ AND
KEPT HIS EYES DOWNFIELD
AND EVENTUALLY LOOKED
BACK SIDE AND FINDS
TYREKE HILL -- TYREEK
HILL.
AL: WE HAVE REACHED IT
BEFORE THE SNAP.
SO FIRST AND 10.
TWO MINUTES REMAINING.
IN THE FIRST HALF WITH
THE BILLS ON TOP OF THE
DOLPHINS. IN
GREEN BAY LAST WEEK.
I KNOW, SHERM AND READY
TO GO.
KIRK: I MISSED THAT.
LOOKS LIKE YOU HAD A HELL
OF A TIME.
AL: THAT PASS IS BROKEN
UP BY WHITE.
ACHANE ANDORRA DAVES YOU
AND TRE'DAVIOUS WHITE
COMES BACK HOME HERE.
KIRK: YOU SEE ACHANE TO
THE OUTSIDE GIVES YOU AN
IDEA OF WHAT KIND OF
SKILL SET HE HAS A
RUNNING BACK TO LINEUP AS
A RECEIVER.
THEY WANT TO MOVE HIM
AROUND.
HECK OF A JOB OF GETTING
HIS ARM -- THAT LEFT ARM
ON THE BACK OR ON THE
BODY.
WORK THE RIGHT ARM AROUND
HIM AND KNOCK THAT BALL
AWAY BY THE VETERAN
WHITE.
AL: SECOND AND 10.
TUA TRYING TO GET IT
DOWNFIELD.
NOBODY HOME.
THROWS IT AWAY.
THIRD AND 10 WITH 1:48
LEFT.
KIRK: IS ITS BACK IN THE
ZONE.
ALL THE EYES ON THAT BACK
SEVEN ON TUA.
SO THE PRESSURE THERE
ABLE TO EFFECT TUA.
MADE HIM VERY, VERY
UNCOMFORTABLE.
YOU CAN SEE HIM -- HE
DIDN'T KNOW TO TURN LEFT
OR TO TURN RIGHT.
EVENTUALLY JUST GETS RID
OF THE BALL.
GOT TO BE CAREFUL HERE
WITH 1:48.
JOSH ALLEN AS GOOD AS ANY
QUARTERBACK IN THE NFL IN
TWO-MINUTE OFFENSE.
AL: CROWD PUMPED UP FOR
THIS THIRD DOWN.
TAGOVAILOA OVER THE MID.
CAUGHT.
HILL SPINS AROUND.
GETS IT.
SO ON A THIRD AND 10,
TYREEK HILL COMES TO THE
RESCUE.
KIRK: TWO PLACE ON THIS
DRIVE WHERE TYREEK HILL
JUST DOES THINGS YOU
DON'T SEE VERY MANY
PLAYERS BE ABLE TO MAKE.
THE THIRD DOWN CONVERSION
WHERE HE HELPS OUT.
FINDS A SOFT SPOT IN THE
ZONE.
THE QUARTERBACK IS
RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE.
AND THEN HERE THE YARDS
AFTER THE CATCH WHERE
THEY HAD HIM COMPLETELY
-- THEY HAD LEVERAGE ON
HIM.
THE OUTSIDE ON BOTH
SIDES.
AND HE'S ABLE TO STILL
STOP AND GO AND OUTRUN
THAT DEFENSE TO GET THOSE
FIRST DOWN YARDS.
AL: SPIN-A-RAMA, MOVING
THE STICKS.
SECOND DOWN TO A MINUTE.
KIRK: WORK THAT CLOCK IF
YOU'RE TUA.
AL: IN THE BACKFIELD.
THEY GIVE IT TO HIM.
GORDON PICKS UP ABOUT
FIVE.
CLOCK IS STILL RUNNING.
MIAMI HAS ALL OF ITS
TIME-OUTS AS DOES BUFFALO
AND THE BILLS DECIDED TO
USE ONE HERE.
KIRK: BUFFALO IS THINKING
ABOUT TRYING TO GET THE
BALL BACK TO JOSH ALLEN.
AL: SO 55 SECONDS.
LAST TWO DRIVES TWO QUICK
THREE AND OUTS.
THIS TIME 10TH PLACE, 48
YARDS AND CONSUMED 28
MINUTES.
KIRK: IF YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT POINTS, MAKE THE
BILLS BURN ALL THEIR
TIME-OUTS.
YOU WANT TO GET POINTS
WITH UNDER 20 SECONDS TO
GO.
SO JOSH ALLEN DOESN'T
HAVE ANY TIME.
AL: BUFFALO HAS ONE
TIME-OUT REMAINING.
TUA TO THE OUTSIDE.
ACHANE.
NOTHING HAPPENING THERE.
HE WANTS TO STAY INBOUNDS
AND HE DOES TO MAKE THE
BILLS USE THAT LAST
TIME-OUT.
THIRD DOWN.
REFEREE: THIRD AND FINAL
TIME-OUT.
BUFFALO.
KIRK: THERE MAY BE SOME
PEOPLE THINKING WHY ISN'T
MIAMI USING THEIR
TIME-OUTS?
THEY'RE SMART.
THEY KNOW WHO THEY'RE
GOING UP AGAINST TONIGHT
IN JOSH ALLEN.
AL: RIGHT.
KIRK: THAT'S WHY SEAN
MCDERMOTT IS SAYING WE
WANT TO GET OUR GUY -- IF
WE GET HIM ON THE FIELD
HERE, WE'RE GOING TO BE
ABLE TO GIVE HIM MAYBE
35, 40 SECONDS TO WORK
WITH.
BILLS GET THE BALL AGAIN
TO START THIS SECOND
HALF.
THEY DEFER.
AL: EXACTLY.
YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE
THEM TWO FOR ONE.
SO 47 SECONDS.
A RUNNING PLAY.
TAKE THE TIME-OUT AND AT
LEAST GET THE FIELD
GOAL.
SEE WHAT THEY HAVE?
STORE HERE.
TUA STEPPING UP.
AVOIDS THE SAC.
HE'S GOING TO RUN.
SLIDES TO A STOP AT THE
18-YARD LINE.
NOW WE'VE GOT A FIRST
DOWN.
NOW YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR
OWN TIME-OUT HERE.
BUT THEY'RE LETTING THE
CLOCK OUT --
KIRK: NOW THEY GET IT.
AND AL, HOW ABOUT TUA
THERE?
NOT THE MOST COMFORTABLE
WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING
OUT OF PRESSURE AND
CREATING.
BE HE'S OUT HERE
COMPETING.
AND HE REALIZES WHEN THIS
THING OPENS UP AND HE'S
GOT EVERYBODY COVERED
DOWNFIELD, THEY'RE
PLAYING ZONE.
THEY'VE GOT EYES ON HIM.
HE STILL WAS ABLE TO FIND
ENOUGH ROOM THERE AND
SHOW THAT HE'S GOT ENOUGH
SPEED TO BE ABLE TO GET
THE FIRST DOWN.
GOOD FEEL.
DIDN'T FORCE IT.
DIDN'T TRY TO FORCE IT
INTO ONE OF HIS RECEIVERS
A COUPLE OF TIMES
ESPECIALLY INDY WEEK
ONE.
AND THEN HE SLIDES TO
AVOID THAT BIG COLLISION
AND HE GETS THE FIRST
DOWN.
GREAT JOB.
AL: HE GETS SACKED.
THEY'RE STILL IN FIELD
GOAL RANGE BUT A LOT
LONGER FIELD GOAL.
BUT NOW IT'S A DIFFERENT
STORY.
HALF A MINUTE.
THEY HAVE TWO TIME-OUTS.
AT THE 17.
ACHANE, THE RUNNING BACK.
TUA PICKED FROM BEHIND.
10-YARD LINE IS
INCOMPLETE.
BOUNCES INTO KINER'S
HAND.
BOSA PUT THE HEAT ON.
SECOND AND 10.
KIRK: HE GOT HIS ARMS
UNDERNEATH THE FOOTBALL.
HE GOT HIS ARMS UNDER THE
BALL BUT IT MUST HAVE
GONE THROUGH HIM RIGHT
THERE.
IF HE KEEPS HIS ELBOWS
TOGETHER, THAT'S A
CATCH.
BUT INSTEAD, IT SLID
RIGHT THROUGH CARRYING IN
OUR PICTURE HERE UP HERE
IN OUR BOOTH WAVING
INCOMPLETE.
WENT RIGHT THROUGH HIS
ARMS.
AL: THIS IS THE 14TH PLAY
OF THIS DRIVE.
SECOND AND 10.
ACHANE.
ABOUT THE 10-YARD LINE.
TAKE A TIME-OUT HERE.
DORIAN WILLIAMS MAKES
THAT TACKLE.
STILL HAVE ONE REMAINING
AND 17 17TICKS.
KIRK: I DON'T KNOW IF
THEY'RE GOING TO SCORE A
TOUCHDOWN BUT AS FAR AS
MANAGING THIS DRIVE,
THEY'VE CONVERTED ON A
FEW DOWNS.
THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK
THE CLOCK DOWN.
WHEN YOU GO BACK TO HOW
IT START AND HOW IT'S
PLAYED OUT, THIS IS ABOUT
AS PERFECT OF A DRIVE AS
YOU COULD HOPE FOR IF
YOU'RE MIKE MCDANIEL.
NOW IT'S A MATTER OF WHAT
THEY TOLD US IN OUR ZOOM,
WE GET DOWN HERE, WE'VE
GOT TO SCORE TOUCHDOWNS
BECAUSE THEY KNOW 17 BLUE
IS ON THE OTHER SIDE AND
HOW TOUGH HE IS TO STOP
FOR THIS MIAMI DEFENSE.
AL: THERE'S THE OWNER OF
THE TEAM, MR. ROSS.
4-4 ON THIRD DOWN.
THIRD AND 3.
HILL IS IN THE BACKFIELD
THIS TIME.
TUA WILL THROW IT TO
HIM.
TYREEK HILL, OUT OF
BOUNDS WITH 11 SECONDS.
THEY CAN SERVE THAT LAST
TIME-OUT.
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT
FIRST AND GOAL.
KIRK: GOOD CALL, AL.
AS YOU MENTIONED OUT OF
THE BACKFIELD.
AND BECAUSE HE'S SO
SUDDEN, EVEN THOUGH THE
BILLS ARE TRYING TO FORCE
HIM BACK TO USE THAT LAST
TIME-OUT, HE'S ABLE TO
NOT ONLY PICK UP THAT
FIRST DOWN BUT WITH THE
SPEED AND AWARENESS ABLE
TO GET OUT OF BOUNDS TO
THE THREE-YARD LINE.
AL: FIVE RUNS, 10 PASSES
ON THIS 15-YARD DRIVE.
KIRK: WITH THAT TIME-OUT,
YOU CAN STILL RUN THE
BALL.
AL: THAT'S GOING TO BE
CAUGHT FOR A TOUCHDOWN BY
JAYLEN WADDLE!
HIS FIRST CATCH OF THE
NIGHT.
AND THE DOLPHINS WHO ARE
IN DIRE STRAITS NOT LONG
AGO LOOKING LIKE BUFFALO
WAS ON THEIR WAY TO A
TOUCHDOWN OR A
TWO-POSSESSION LEAD ABLE
TO GET THE STOP AND DOWN
THE FIELD THEY GO.
71 YARDS.
KIRK: YEAH, AND THAT
MISSED FIELD GOAL I THINK
GAVE THEM SOME LIFE BUT
IT WAS STILL UP TO THE
OFFENSE TO PUT A
PRODUCTIVE DRIVE TOGETHER
HERE KNOWING THAT THEY
HAD TO PUT POINTS UP ON
THE BOARD AND HAD TO
CONVERT.
THEY WERE ABLE TO EXECUTE
, LOOK AT EIGHT SECONDS
LEFT.
IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN AS
WE SAID ANY BETTER FOR
MIKE MCDANIEL.
WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME,
I MENTIONED THEY COULD
STILL RUN THE BALL, I
THINK TUA SAW THE LOOK
THAT HE WANT.
BECAUSE LOOK AT THIS
MATCHUP RIGHT HERE.
AND LOOK AT THE CUSHION.
TRE'DAVIOUS WHITE ENDS UP
GIVING WADDLE AT THE LINE
OF SCRIMMAGE.
IT'S SURPRISING.
MAKES IT EASY FOR TUA
JUST TO FLIP IT OUT THERE
WITH THAT SOFT COVERAGE.
WADDLE IS ABLE TO GET
DOWN THE PLAY FOR A
TOUCHDOWN.
THEY BLITZ THE CORNER.
THIS KEPT THE DRIVE ALIVE
FOR A SCRAMBLE WHICH
ISN'T HIS GAME.
LOOK BACKSIDE AND FINDS
TYREEK HILL IN THE SOFT
SPOT, THE ZONE.
AND HERE'S HILL AGAIN.
YARDS AFTER THE CATCH.
THEY HAD HIM LEVERAGE AND
HE OUTRAN THE DEFENSE.
SO WHAT A DRIVE.
A TEAM THAT'S 0-2.
OWN FANS DOUBTING HIM.
SIGNS OVER THEIR OWN
STADIUM ABOUT FIRING THE
HEAD COACH.
AND IN A SHORT WEEK AND A
TOUGH ENVIRONMENT AND A
DIVISIONAL MATCHUP, EVERY
REASON TO GIVE UP, AND
INSTEAD THEY FIGHT BACK
TO GET IT TO 14-14.
AL: TO TIE THE GAME WITH
EIGHT SECONDS.
WADDLE WHO WAS ON THE
INJURY LIST THIS WEEK
WITH A SHOULDER INJURY.
HE AND HILL THE KEY
DRIVERS.
THE KICKOFF.
TO THE END ZONE.
THEY'RE GOING TO RUN IT
OUT.
AND NOW PAST THE 25 TO
THE 30 GOES CODRINGTON.
CLOCK STOPS AT TWO
SECONDS.
WINNING PLAY FOR MOVIE
NIGHT, PRIME VIDEO, WATCH
"HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON."
"SUPERMAN" AVAILABLE TO
RENT OR BUY ON PRIME
VIDEO.
BUFFALO, GREAT NIGHT, 66
DEGREES.
KIRK: THAT WASN'T OUR
HOTEL, WAS IT?
AL: NO, SIR, WE WERE IN
THE SUBURBS.
I CAN SPOT A HOTEL MILES
AWAY AS YOU WELL KNOW.
MEANWHILE, KNEEL DOWN
HERE.
TIED AT 14-14.
BILLS GET THE SECOND HALF
PICKOFF.
GO TO KAYLEE.
KAYLEE: JOHN, DESCRIBE
THE CHALLENGES THAT THE
MIAMI OFFENSE IS GIVING
YOU. AT HIGH MARK --
HIGHMARK STADIUM.
WE'LL SEND IT DOWN TO
CODRINGTON AND TY JOHNSON
SET UP AT THE GOAL LINE.
ON THIS 66 DEGREE NIGHT.
COMING UP, AT THE 9 YARDS
LINE.
CODRINGTON.
TO THE 40.
TO KAYLEE MOMENTS AGO.
KAYLEE: MIKE, YOU TOLD US
THAT TONIGHT WOULD
REQUIRE YOUR TEAM'S BEST
FOOTBALL.
HOW DO YOU CHARACTERIZE
WHAT THEY'VE DONE THROUGH
ONE HALF?
SO FAR, SO GOOD.
BUT IT'S MEANINGLESS
WITHOUT ANOTHER HALF.
WE HAVE A LOT OF FOOTBALL
TO PLAY AND A LOT OF
EXECUTION.
KAYLEE: WHAT IS PRIORITY
FOR YOUR DEFENSE?
YOU'RE PLAYING ONE OF
THE BEST PLAYERS IN THE
LEAGUE.
YOU HAVE TO BE
DISCIPLINED.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM
EARN EVERY YARD.
IF IT GIVES YOU AN OP,
YOU HAVE TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF IT.
KAYLEE: THANKS, MIKE.
THANK YOU.
KAYLEE: THEY STOPPED THEM
ON THE ERRANT FIELD
GOAL.
JAMES COOK STARTS THIS
DRIVE HERE.
AND COOK HAS CARRIED NINE
TIMES FOR 74 YARDS THIS
EVENING.
KIRK: I LIKE TO SEE THIS
JUST TO START THE SECOND
HALF.
FIRST PLAY.
JUST KIND OF GETTING
THINGS GOING HERE, BANG.
JUST SENDING A MESSAGE
-- BUTLER.T
MATTHEW BUTLER.
HE'S FLASHED AGAINST THE
RUN AND PLAYS LIKE THAT,
GETTING LEVERAGE AS
KINKAID WAS IN MOTION.
HE JUST THREW HIM BACK.
AL: ALLEN FIRES.
STOPPED AT THE 46 YARDS
LINE.
KEON COLEMAN.
THIRD DOWN AND 2 FOR
BUFFALO.
KIRK: JOSH ALLEN HAS HAD
A PRETTY GOOD POCKET MOST
OF THE NIGHT.
ONLY BEEN PRESSURED ONE
TIME.
CHUBB CAME UP WITH THAT
THIRD DOWN SACK THAT THEY
EVENTUALLY MUSSED.
BUT FOR THE MOST PART
HE'S ABLE TO SURVEY THIS
DOLPHIN SECONDARY
SECONDARY.
AL: THIRD DOWN ABOUT A
YARD AND A HALF.
TY JOHNSON IN THE
BACKFIELD.
PROTECTED WELL.
THROW, CAUGHT.
FIRST DOWN.
A LOT MORE.
OUT OF THE BACKFIELD WITH
A FLAG.
ALAN EK IS THE REFEREE.
AND THE CALL IS
REFEREE: ILLEGAL
CONTACT.
THE PENALTY IS DECLINEED.
FIRST DOWN.
AL: FITZPATRICK.
KIRK: HE'S CHECKING FOR
THE POTENTIAL BLITZ OF 20
THERE, BROOKS.
HE TAKES ON MAN
COVERAGE.
AND IT'S PROBABLY THE
AREA -- ONE OF THE AREA
HE'S GROWN THE MOST.
TAKEN IT OFF THE TOUCH
BALL, ROUTINE THROW
INSTEAD OF PUTTING HEAT
ON IT.
EASY COMPLETION.
AL: FIRST DOWN OVER THE
MIDDLE.
GAIN OF 15 HERE FOR
SHAKIR.
TAKING IT TO THE 29-YARD
LINE.
KIRK: JOSH ALLEN SEES
EVERYTHING.
BUT HE SEES HIS PRESSURE
RIGHT HERE.
HE SAYS, OK.
NO PROBLEM.
LET'S -- LET'S GET THE
BALL OUT RIGHT WHERE THAT
BLITZ CAME FROM FROM.
BIG SPACE.
AL: GOING NO-HUDDLE
HERE.
ALLEN FLUSHED OUT.
PUMP-FAKES.
THROWS.
KNOCKED DOWN.
BROOKS IS THERE.
JORDAN BROOKS.
ANOTHER FLAG HERE.
KIRK: LEFT TACKLE.
CHUBB WORKING TO GO BY
HIM THE WAY HE DID WITH
THAT SACK.
ALL DAWKINS COULD DO IS
GRAB ON TO IT.
.
REFEREE: HOLDING NUMBER
73 OFFENSE.
10-YARD PENALTIES.
FIRST DOWN.
AL: TO GET A JOB AS A
REFEREE, YOU HAVE TO HAVE
GREAT BICEPS.
KIRK: HE'S ALWAYS IN THE
GYM PUMPING HIGH RON.
-- PUMPING IRON.
YOU HAVE TO GO WITH A
TIGHT SHIRT.
KAYLEE: NO --
AL: NO MATTER WHAT THE
TELL-- TEMPERATURE IS.
FIRST AND 30.
ALLEN STEPS UP.
ALLEN IS GOING TO TAKE
OFF.
INSIDE THE 30.
SLIDES, STOPS SHY OF A
FIRST DOWN.
SQUIRMISH BREAKING OUT.
PLENTY OF ACTION AFTER
THE ACTION.
KIRK: THEY PLAY MAN
COVERAGE HERE BUT THEY
SPY WITH TYREL DODSON.
HE FALLS FOR THAT KIND OF
A BALL FAKE THERE.
WE SEE HIM FLIP IT A
COUPLE OF TIMES.
AL: KINKAID AND RASUL
DOUGLAS IN THAT
SQUIRMISH.
KIRK: YOU SEE JOSH ALLEN
UPSET THERE AT THE END OF
THIS PLAY.
DODSON CATCHES UP ON HIM.
AND DODSON FINISHES.
KINKAID DIDN'T LIKE THAT
AT ALL.
AL: DODSON AND KINKAID.
NOW SECOND DOWN AND 1
FROM THE 20.
CAUGHT, FIRST DOWN.
A LOT OF ROOM TO ROAM.
KINKAID, SCORED THEIR
FIRST TOUCHDOWN OF THE
NIGHT.
GAIN OF 19.
KIRK: REALLY GOOD JOB OUT
IN FRONT OF THIS PLAY.
BUT TWO OF THE RECEIVERS,
SHAKIR DOES A GOOD JOB.
YOU SEE ELIJAH MOORE.
10-18.
HOW ABOUT THAT ARM
ANGLE?
FLIP THERE BY JOSH ALLEN.
KINKAID THE SPEED ALMOST
TAKES IT TO THE END
ZONE.
BUT TWO GREAT PLOTS OUT
THERE TO SPRING HIM
LOOSE.
AL: MINKAH FITZPATRICK
CAME BACK TO BUFFALO IN
THE DEAL WITH
PITTSBURGH.
FIRST DOWN AND GOAL NOW.
BACK TO MIAMI.
ALLEN.
FAKES.
TAKEN DOWN.
FOR A LOSS OF TWO.
AND A FLAG COMES IN AT
THE END.
AGAIN, YOU'VE GOT SPENCER
BROWN THE RIGHT TACKLE
THAT TIME.
KIRK: JORDAN BROOKS --
DOLPHINS MAKE A GOOD PLAY
AND THEN THEY MAKE A
MENTAL ERROR.
HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF
THIS DEFENSE.
BUT HE TAKES IT TOO FAR.
IT'S THE SECOND TIME IN
THIS SERIES.
REFEREE: AFTER THE PLAY
WAS OVER OVER,
UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS.
NUMBER 20.
AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
KIRK: THE PLAY IS OVER.
AND THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG.
YOU WANT TO SEE A DEFENSE
BE AGGRESSIVE.
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE
EARTH SMART.
YOU COME UP WITH A HECK
OF A STOP.
THE PLAY IS OVER.
THE PLAY IS OVER.
AND YOU TAKE HEM DOWN
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE
OFFICIAL.
AL: FIRST AND GOAL NOW.
THE BALL AT THE 2 YARDS
LINE.
ALLEN UNDER CENTER.
INTO THE END ZONE.
MADE IT LOOK EASY.
TOUCHDOWN, BUFFALO.
KIRK: SPENCER BROWN AT
RIGHT TACK.
TACKLE.
HOW MUCH FUN IS HE TO
WATCH?
YOU KNOW, HAS A
REPRESENTATION AS A GREAT
BLOCKER.
AS YOU SAID, AL, MADE IT
LOOK VERY, VERY EASY ON
THAT RIGHT SIDE TO OPEN
IT UP.
AND COOK JUST WALKS IN
FOR THE TOUCHDOWN.
AL: COOK, 10 CARRIES.
76 YARDS.
MATT PRATER FOR THE EXTRA
POINT.
BANGS THAT ONE THROUGH.
SO THAT DRIVE OPENS UP
THE SECOND HALF.
1:37 INTO IT.
AND BUFFALO BACK UP ON
TOP 21-14.
S BUT THESE WERE TWO
OF THEM AND HE WAS A
SENSATION IN BOTH TOWNS.
YOU WEREN'T QUITE JIM
KELLY HERE BUT THEY LOVE
YOU.
RYAN: THANK YOU.
THEY ENJOY THE DAD BODS
HERE, I'LL TELL YOU THAT.
AL: TAKEN FROM THE 3-YARD
LINE.
MALIK WASHINGTON.
GETS AWAY FROM THE INITIAL
TACKLE TO THE 25-YARD
LINE.
MEANWHILE, WE COME IN, WE
THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET A
ROUT BUT THAT WAS QUITE A
DRIVE BY THE DOLPHINS AT
THE END OF THE FIRST
HALF.
RYAN: IT WAS AND IT WAS
THE MISSED FIELD GOAL
BEFORE THAT THAT WAS THE
BIG DEAL.
I WAS SITTING DOWN THERE
WITH SHERM.
HE SAID THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN.
THEY HAVE TO MISS A FIELD
GOAL, WE HAVE TO GET
TOUCHDOWN BECAUSE THEY'RE
DEFLATED ON DEFENSE.
KIRK: IF MIAMI CAN HANG
AROUND, THAT'S DEFINITELY
A PLAY TO REMEMBER.
AL: FROM THE 29-YARD
LINE.
FROM THE OUTSIDE, THIS
PASS AGAINST WADDLE WHO
GETS SMOTHERED RIGHT AWAY
BY WHITE.
MIAMI COMES IN, BIG
UNDERDOG, A LOT OF STUFF
GOING ON, THE COACH IS ON
THE HOT SEAT.
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO
THINK ABOUT AS A
COLLECTIVE UNIT AT THIS
POINT?
YOU HAVE TO STAY
TOGETHER.
WHEN HE GOT THAT TOUCHDOWN
LAST WEEK, THERE WAS NO
CELEBRATION.
AL: SECOND DOWN 13, KEEP
IT ON THE GROUND.
REQUIRE ITRYAN: IT BECOMES
A LOT ABOUT VIBES WITH
THESE GUYS.
EVERYTHING FALLS ON YOU
AND YOUR URGENCY IN THIS
SITUATION.
AL: HE HAD FOUR THIRD DOWN
CONVERSIONS ON TOUCHDOWN
DRIVE.
THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP
THE TOUCHDOWN TO START THE
SECOND HALF THEN GO THREE
AND OUT QUICKLY.
FACING THAT POSSIBLY
DILEMMA HERE, THIRD AND
11.
HAS TIME.
GOING DEEP DOWNFIELD AND
INCOMPLETE.
INTENDED THERE FOR TYREEK
HILL.
COVERAGE WAS GOOD, FOURTH
DOWN.
KIRK: LOOKS LIKE TAYLOR
POSSIBLY MADE A PLAY ON
THE BOARD.
IT WAS THEIR CORNER
BENFORD.
NORMAL RULES DON'T APPLY
WHEN TYREEK HILL IS
RUNNING THE POST.
YOU'RE BETTING ON HIM TO
GO HIGH POINT THE BALL AND
MAKE A PLAY ON IT.
THIRD DOWN, THEY JUST PUT
IT UP IN THE AIR, INTO THE
DOUBLE-COVERAGE LOOK AND
HOPED THAT HAD 10 GOT HIS
HANDS ON IT.
DIDN'T COME DOWN WITH THAT FOOTBALL."
KIRK: GOOD TRAVEL FOR
MICHAELS AND COMPANY
LIVING OUT WEST.
AL: YOU, ON THE OTHER
HAND, DOING 87 GAMES.
HERE'S THE PUNT.
A GOOD ONE.
FIELDED AT THE 17 AND
DROPPED THERE BUT
RECOVERED BY CODRINGTON.
ALMOST A DISASTER FOR THE
BILLS.
KIRK: THAT'S WHAT MIAMI IS
LOOKING FOR.
OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF A MISTAKE.
BONNER IS RIGHT THERE AND
HECK OF A JOB OF GETTING
THAT FOOTBALL BACK THERE.
VERY, VERY CLOSE.
CODRINGTON ABLE TO JUST
GET IT BACK.
AL: 55-YARD PUNT.
UPSET WITH HIMSELF.
WALKING IT OFF ON THE
SIDELINE.
ALAN IS 15-17 FOR 147.
NICE TACKLE THERE, COMING
UP.
JACK JONES MAKING THE STOP
ACROSS THE LINE OF
SCRIMMAGE.
KIRK: HOW ABOUT THAT?
JACK JONES, KNOWN FOR HIS
ABILITY TO COVER BUT THIS
TIME ON THAT BLITZ DOES A
GOOD JOB OF GETTING
UNDERNEATH AND SHOWING
SOME TOUGHNESS THERE ON
FIRST AND 10.
DOLPHINS ROLL THE DICE AND
IT PAYS OFF BACKSIDE
THERE.
GREAT EFFORT BY JACK
JONES.
AL: SECOND DOWN 10.
RAY DAVIS IS NOW THE BACK.
FAKES THE HAND OFF AND THE
PASS IS CAUGHT BUT THAT'S
COVERED WELL AS WELL.
ALEIJA MOORE HAD A BIG
PLAY EARLIER.
JACK JONES AGAIN WITH THE
COVERAGE.
THIRD DOWN AND 9 FOR THE
BILLS.
KIRK: BACK-TO-BACK PLAYS.
THE DOLPHINS' DEFENSIVE
COORDINATOR DIALING IT UP.
DAVIS, THE SAFETY BUT
MOSTLY BEING TO PUSH THE
RECEIVER OUT OF BOUNDS
THERE AFTER A VERY SHORT
GAIN.
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY.
AL: HALFWAY MARK OF THE
THIRD QUARTER.
BILLS UP BY SEVEN.
THIRD AND 9.
TIGHT FORMATION HERE.
PASS TAUGHT.
BUT STOPPED WELL SHY OF
THE FIRST DOWN.
DALTON KINCAID SO MIAMI
CREATES A THREE AND OUT,
GETS THE BALL BACK.
KIRK: THEY DID THEIR JOB.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY
NEEDED.
HAD A NICE PUNT, ABLE TO
FLIP THE FIELD.
INSTEAD OF GIVING UP JOSH
ALLEN SOME FIRST DOWN AND
IS MOVING THE FOOTBALL.
THEY GET A THREE AND OUT
TO GIVE THE BAWL BACK TO
TUA.
STILL WITHIN A POSSESSION
HERE.
AL: SO CAMERON JOHNSTON
COMES IN TO PUNT.
IT'S BUFFALO'S FIRST PUNT
OF THE NIGHT.
UNDERNEATH, 25-YARD LINE,
MALIK WASHINGTON.
NICE RUNBACK HERE.
12-YARD RETURN AND MIAMI
TO TAKE OVER WITH 6:30 TO
GO IN THE STATS POWERED
BY AWS.
A NIGHT WHERE TOURA HASN'T
THROWN FOR A TON OF YARDS
BUT NEGATIVE YARDS.
TIME TO THROW, OVER THREE
SECONDS, THE SLOWEST OF
HIS CAREER BUT EIGHT OF
HIS 13 PASS PASSES BEHIND
THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
SO THAT'S WHY THAT AVERAGE
IS SO TIGHT.
DID TAKE A SHOT LAST TIME
OUT TO TYREEK HILL.
ENDED UP BEING AN
INCOMPLETION.
AL: 20 ATTEMPTS, 63 TOTAL
YARDS.
FLIPBACK AND A NICE RUN.
A GAIN OF CLOSE TO SIX BY
ACHANE.
KIRK, YOU BEGIN TO BONDER
WHEN THE OFFENSIVE LINE
ISSUES FOR MIAMI -- WOULD
MCDANIEL CALL A MORE
CONSERVATIVE GAME
TONIGHT?
WHAT DO YOU SEE?
KIRK: IF YOU LOOK AT THE
DIFFERENT WAYS TO ATTACK
AS AN OFFENSE, THEY
TYPICALLY USE A LOT OF
MOTIONS AND A LOT OF
DIFFERENT THINGS.
A SHORT WEEK ON THE ROAD,
FOUR NEW STARTERS UP
FRONT.
YEAH, I THINK THEY HAVE
HAD TO SIMPLIFY IT
TONIGHT.
AL: SECOND DOWN AND 5.
TUA STEPPING UP.
DEEP DOWN THE SIDELINE BUT
THE RECEIVER FALLING
DOWN.
THAT'S HILL.
TYREEK HILL TO THE GROUND
AND SLOWLY COMING BACK.
BEFORE A THIRD AND 5.
KIRK: IMPORTANT THING HERE
AGAINST BENFORD, HE BEATS
HIM OFF THE LINE, LITTLE
HOLE THERE BUT THEN LOSES
HIS FOOTING.
HE KEEPS HIS FEET.
BECAUSE HE WON AT THE LINE
OF SCRIMMAGE THEY HAD A
SHOT THERE FOR FIRST
DOWN.
AL: THE CROWD AGAIN RISING
AS ONE, AS THEY OFTEN DO.
WHEN THE DEFENSE FACES A
THIRD DOWN.
FROM THE 41.
FALSE START HERE.
KIRK: LEFT TACKLE.
REFEREE: FIRST CHARGED
TIME-OUT, BUFFALO.
30-SECOND TIME-OUT.
AL: THEY GOT A TIME-OUT
BEFORE THAT.
TUA COMES TO THE
SIDELINE.
IT'S TIME FOR THE CROWNING
PERFORMANCE PRESENTED BY
DRAFTKINGS PICK SIX.
TUA, 63 PASSING YARDS WITH
THAT ONE T.D.
ALLEN, 153.
17-19, ONLY TWO
INCOMPLETIONS FOR JOSH.
KIRK: AND JUST TO ANSWER
YOUR QUESTION A LITTLE BIT
MORE THERE, I THINK MIKE
MCDANIELS CALLING THIS
GAME, 63 YARDS.
IFICS BEFORE THE GAME HOW
HE'S GOING TO HAVE 63
YARDS THROUGH THE AIR WITH
5:47 TO GO IN THE THIRD,
YOU'D THINK GAME'S OVER
BUT HE'S CALLING THE GAME
AND MANAGING THE GAME
PLAYING COMPLEMENTARY
FOOTBALL.
HE'S TRYING TO PLAY SMART
FOOTBALL.
AL: THAT WAS A PERFECTLY
MANAGED DRIVE, THAT
16-PLAY DRIVE WITH THE
USAGE OF THE TIME-OUTS AND
PLAY CALLING.
GOT THEM BACK INTO THE
GAME.
THIRD AND 5.
TAGOVAILOA AVOIDS THE
SACK, CHASED BY THREE
BILLS AND THROWS IT
BASICALLY AWAY DOWN THE
LEFT SIDELINE.
SO FOURTH AND 5.
KIRK: HE HAD EXACTLY WHAT
HE WANTED.
HE WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT
MALIK WASHINGTON, WHO WAS
STACKED.
IF YOU LOOK AT WADDLE IN
FRONT, SIX BEHIND IN
WASHINGTON AND LOOK AT THE
EYES OF TUA.
LOOK AT THE PROTECTION.
THAT BALL IS OUT RIGHT
THERE, THAT'S A FIRST
DOWN.
INSTEAD, HIS EYES ARE
THERE, HIS FEET ARE NOT
AND HE COMES OFF HIM.
AL: JAKE BAILEY TO PUNT
NOW FOR THE FOURTH TIME.
AVERAGING 52 YARDS PER
BOOT.
SKY-HIGH KICK., I'M HUNGRY.
HAVE YOU HAD ANY WINGS?
KIRK: I HAVE NOT.
AL: WE HAVE SOME IN THE
WING, COME ON UP.
KAYLEE: OF COURSE YOU DO.
AL: CALVE
AL: FIRST AND 10.
ALLEN TAKES OFF.
JOSH COMES FROM A TINY
TOWN.
FIREBALL, CALIFORNIA,
POPULATION SOMEWHERE
BETWEEN 6,000 AND 8,000.
IT IS THE CANTALOUPE
CAPITAL OF WHATEVER.
THEY HAVE THE CANTALOUPE
FESTIVAL EVERY SUMMER.
HE, OF COURSE, HAS BEEN
THE GRAND MARSHAL.
KIRK: VERY PROUD OF THAT.
AL: HE WASSIST THRILLED TO
GET DRAFTED BY BUFFALO.
GOING TO BE MUCH MORE
COMFORTABLE IN A SMALLER
TOWN.
SECOND DOWN AND 6.
COOK.
AND THE OTHER THING, TOO,
IS, HE'S NOT THE HIGHEST
PAID GUY IN THE LEAGUE BUT
IT'S ALMOST LIKE TOM BRADY
IN A WAY AT NEW ENGLAND.
YOU LEAVE SOME MONEY ON
THE TABLE SO YOU CAN TAKE
CARE OF THE BACK END OF
THE ROSTER.
KIRK: AND AS FAR AS
SUPERSTARS GO, WHAT A
GREAT TEAMMATE.
EVEN THOUGH HE'S THE
M.V.P. OF THE LEAGUE,
INCREDIBLY HUMBLE AND
RECEPTIVE.
HE TALKED ABOUT, WE'RE IN
BUFFALO, WE'RE HANGING OUT
PLAYING VIDEO GAMES
TOGETHER, GOING OUT TO EAT
TOGETHER.
AL: IT'S A GREAT LOVE
AFFAIR.
HE WITH THE TOWN, THE TOWN
WITH HIM.
TY JOHNSON.
THIRD AND 2.
DANCING, THROWING, CAUGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF A LOT OF
TRAFFIC.
THEY CONVERT AND SHAVERS
MAKES THAT GRAB, FIRST
DOWN.
KIRK: WHEN THEY'VE PLAYED
DONE ZONE TONIGHT HE'S NOW
12-1 FOR A TOUCHDOWN AND
HERE ON A THIRD AND SHORT,
THEY SIT BACK, TRY TO KEEP
SOME EYES ON HIM AND DROP
THE DEFENSIVE LINEMAN
SIELER BUT HE'S STILL ABLE
TO FIND A HOLE.
SHAVERS DOES A GOOD JOB OF
SITTING DOWN IN IT AND
THERE'S THE FIRST DOWN.
AL: 18-20.
ON A ROLL.
HAS TIME.
LOOKING, LOOKING, LOOKING
AND THEN THROWING IT OUT
OF BOUNDS.
SECOND DIANA.
KIRK: HE'S A UNICORN.
6'5", 237 POUNDS.
CHANGE OF THE ARM ANGLE.
FLIP THERE, A LA BRETT
FAVRE AND THERE'S THE
ACCURACY.
TO HIS TIGHT END, A CHANCE
TO GET INTO THE END ZONE.
BECAUSE HE FLIPS IT ON THE
RUN SO MUCH, MAKES THE
LINEBACKERS AWARE OF THAT
AND CONCERNED WHEN HE
TAKES OFF THAT HE MIGHT DO
THAT.
ABLE TO USE THAT BALL FAKE
LIKE A BIG POWER GUARD ON
THE BREAKAWAY.
AL: SECOND AND 10.
PLAY CLOCK DOWN TO THREE.
GETS IT AWAY.
PASS IS INCOMPLETE.
INTENDED FOR COLEMAN
DOUGLAS BUT GOOD COVERAGE
ON THE PLAY.
LOOKING AT THE OFFICIAL
SAYING I DIDN'T TOUCH HIM,
I'M GOOD.
KIRK: IF YOU'RE THE BILLS,
THIS IS YOUR GUY.
KEION COLEMAN, WHETHER
IT'S GETTING PHYSICAL OVER
THERE OR NOT, KEION
COLEMAN HAS TO BECOME THAT
GUY INTO THE BOUNDARY THAT
MAKES THAT PLAY
CONSISTENTLY.
BALL IS THROWN, HE'S
COMING BACK TO HIM, IN
POSSESSION.
YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR HANDS
AND MAKE THAT CATCH,
ESPECIALLY IN A
ONE-POSSESSION GAME.
AL: SECOND-ROUND PICK OUT
OF FLORIDA STATE LAST
YEAR.
THIRD AND 10.
DEEP DROP.
THROWS UNDERNEATH.
DROPPED.
TY JOHNSON CAN'T HANDLE
THAT SO THE MIAMI DEFENSE
STIFFENS AGAIN.
PLAYING SO MUCH BETTER
TONIGHT THAN IN THE LAST
TWO GAMES.
KIRK: YOU'RE SO RIGHT.
IT'S LIKE WATCHING A
DIFFERENT TEAM.
WE TALKED IN THE OPEN
ABOUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE FINAL SCORE IS GOING
TO BE BUT THE WAY THEY
LOOKED DEFENSIVELY THE
FIRST COUPLE OF GAMES,
JUST COME OUT AND PLAY AS
A GROUP AND FIGHT.
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'RE MADE
OF.
CONSIDERING WHEN THEY'RE
FACING TONIGHT, THEY'VE
PLAYED VERY WELL.
AL: THEY GAVE UP POINTS ON
THE FIRST 10 DRIVES THEY
FACED THIS SEASON BEFORE
THEY STIFFENED U LIKE GREEN
BAY WAS UP BY SO MUCH AND
EVENTUALLY THAT WOULD GO
ON TO WIN BUT WE EXCEPT
KEPT LOOKING AT THE
SCOREBOARD AND THINKING
IT'S A ONE-POSSESSION GAME
AND HERE WE WERE A WEEK
LATER IN BUFFALO AND IT
FEELS LIKE BUFFALO IS VERY
MUCH IN COMMAND BUT YET
WITH 2:58 TO GO IN THE
THIRD.
HERE'S MIAMI, DOWN SEVEN.
AL: FROM THE 33-YARD LINE
THEY BEGIN IN DRIVE.
TUA.
UNDER PRESSURE.
FLIPS IT UP.
NICE MOVE THERE.
ACHANE.
SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH FOR THE
FIRST DOWN.
SEE WHERE THEY SPOT IT.
BROKE AWAY THAT TIME FROM
TARON JOHNSON.
KIRK: ABOUT A YARD SHORT
AND TARON JOHNSON, TO ME
ONE OF THE TOP NICKEL
CORNERS.
WHAT A PLAY BY ACHANE TO
BE ABLE TO CATCH THE BALL
AND MAKE JOHNSON MISS, TO
BE ABLE TO PICK UP THOSE
YARDS AFTER THE CATCH.
IT'S ALL ABOUT TAKEO
SPIKESLING IN SPACE WHEN
YOU DEFEND THE SPEED OF
THE MIAMI DOLPHINS.
YOU MIGHT BE THERE BUT YOU
HAVE TO COME UP WITH A
TACKLE.
AL: SECOND AND 1.
BREAKING A TACKLE.
GORDON.
AND GORDON TO THE 42-YARD
LINE.
THE ROOKIE LOOKING VERY
GOOD TONIGHT.
KIRK: I CAN'T REMEMBER THE
LAST TIME THEY HAD A BACK
LIKE THIS.
WITH ALL THIS SPEED, A GUY
THAT CAN RUN BETWEEN THE
TACKLES AND DO THIS.
BE ABLE TO SHAKE OFF OF A
WOULD-BE TACKLER AND BE
ABLE TO PICK UP BIG YARDS
AFTER THAT.
KEEPS HIS BALANCE AND HE'S
GOT THE SPEED.
I GUESS MAYBE RONNIE
BROWN?
I DON'T REMEMBER THE LAST
BACK THEY HAD THAT COULD
DO THAT KIND OF THING WITH
POWER.
AL: RICKY WILLIAMS?
KIRK: OH, THAT'S GOING WAY
BACK.
AL: THAT'S ME.
WAY BACK MACHINE HERE.
AND WAY BACK THIS TIME AS
BERNARD TAKES CARE OF
GORDON IN THE BACKFIELD.
KIRK: THE LINEBACKERS THAT
TIME AND BERNARD IS
OVERLOOKED I THINK AS ONE
OF THE TOP LINEBACKERS.
WHAT HE DOES FOR HIS
DEFENSE.
EIGHT RIGHT IN THE
MIDDLE.
WATCH HIM GET DOWNHILL,
NOT ALLOWING BREWER TO
CLIMB UP TO THAT SECOND
LEVEL.
GREAT JOB.
HIS INSTINCTS ARE WHAT
SEPARATES HIM.
HE'S NOT A BIG
LINEBACKER.
6'1", 2258 IN THE MIDDLE
BUT GREAT JOB, GREAT
FOOTBALL I.Q.
AL: SECOND AND 12.
TUA FLIPS IT, OPEN.
CONNER, A FLAG IS DOWN.
JULY RANNIAN HILL.
-- JULIAN HILL.
KIRK: THEY HAVE A LINEMAN
DOWNHILL.
I THINK IT'S THE ROOKIE,
THE LEFT GUARD.
REFEREE: INELIGIBLE PLAYER
DOWNFIELD, NUMBER 72
OFFENSE.
FIVE-YARD PENALTY FROM THE
PREVIOUS SPOT, REPLAY
SECOND DOWN.
KIRK: THAT WAS A BIG, BIG
MISTAKE AT LEFT GUARD.
72, RIGHT HERE.
SEE HIM WORKING
DOWNFIELD.
MEANWHILE, THE BILLS'
DEFENSE IS GOING DOWNHILL
WITH THEIR SPEED.
THEY FINALLY GET THE BALL
TO THEIR TIGHT END JULIAN
HILL.
THAT'S A FIRST DOWN AND
MORE AND INSTEAD PUSH THEM
WAY BACK CLOSE TO MIDFIELD
AND SECOND AND 17.
AL: SECOND DOWN AND 17.
CAN'T GET OUT OF A TACKLE
OF BEN BENFORD.
ACHANE STOPPED THERE.
THIRD AND A MILE.
KIRK: I'VE GOT TO PET A
LITTLE ASTERISK BY THAT
SECOND DOWN PLAY.
THAT'S ONE TO
TONIGHT'S AERIAL COVERAGE
PRESENTED BY ROYAL
CARIBBEAN.
THAT'S THE TOP OF THE
LIBERTY BUILDING.
HERE IN WILF.
AL MICHAELS, KIRK
HERBSTREIT, KAYLEE
HARTUNG.
THIRD AND 13.
A LATERAL HERE, DANGEROUS
PLAY BUT WORKS FOR ABOUT
10 YARDS.
MALIK WASHINGTON AND
ACHANE INVOLVED AND NEEDED
14 AND --
KIRK: IT FELT LIKE THEY
WERE CALLING THAT PLAY.
A LITTLE BIT OF A RISK
THERE, TO SET UP THIS
PLAY.
MIKE MCDANIEL ALREADY
KNOWS PROBABLY IF THEY
WERE ABLE TO EXECUTE
THERE, PROBABLY IN A
FOURTH AND 4, FOURTH AND 5
AND HERE THEY ARE.
AL: RIGHT, 36-YARD LINE,
FOURTH DOWN AND 4.
HILL MOVES TO THE
OUTSIDE.
TUA LOOKS THAT WAY.
COMPLETES IT TO WADDLE.
SO WADDLE, TWO BIG CATCHES
TONIGHT.
ONE, OF COURSE, WENT FOR
THE TOUCHDOWN.
THAT GOES FOR 15 ON A
FOURTH DOWN.
KIRK: ONE OF YOUR FASTEST
RECEIVERS AGAINST WHITE
WHO HAS SOME AIM, COMING
OFF SOME INJURIES.
A FOOTRACE.
YOU HAVE TO OUTRUN HIM,
WHICH HE'S ABLE TO DO.
TUA IN RHYTHM.
GREAT PROTECTION, HE'S
ABLE TO STEP UP, MAKE THE
ACCURATE THROW AND ABLE TO
OVERCOME THE ILLEGAL MAN
DOWNFIELD TO KEEP THIS
DRIVE ALIVE.
NEW SET OF DOWNS.
AL: TUA TIMELY GET TO 100
YARDS ON HIS 26TH PASS OF
THE NIGHT.
BIG HOLE THROUGH THE
MIDDLE.
FIRST AND GOAL, DE'VON
ACHANE.
ACHANE THE WORKHORSE
TONIGHT.
CARRIED NINE TIMES, 56
YARDS.
A GAIN OF 14 YEAR.
KIRK: HOW ABOUT THE
BILLS?
A HECK OF A JOB BY THE BIG
OFFENSIVE LINE PUSHING AND
OPENING UP THAT PLAY UP
FROM THE BACK.
GREAT VISION AS WELL.
AL: GREAT BOBBING BY BOROM.
ACHANE AGAIN.
SECOND AND GOAL.
KIRK: BRUNSKILL HAS COME
INTO THE GAME AFTER KEION
SMITH.
DOING A HECK OF A JOB, AS
YOU MENTIONED.
HE'S A GUY THAT CAN PLAY
CENTER OR GUARD AND RIGHT
NOW HE'S IN THERE.
THEY'RE USING EVERYBODY
THIS WEEK ON THIS
OFFENSIVE LINE WITH THE
INJURIES AND YET HERE THEY
ARE SHOWING A LOT OF PRIDE
FIGHTING THEIR TAILS OFF.
AL: SECOND AND GOAL.
TUA TOTE END ZONE FOR A
TOUCHDOWN!
TYREEK HILL.
A COUPLE OF FLIPS AND A
POINT AWAY FROM TYING THE
GAME.
KIRK: WHAT A ROUTE BY
TYREEK HILL AND GOOD
PATIENCE OFF THAT
PLAY-ACTION BY TUA TO LET
HIM BE ABLE TO SET UP BEN
FORD ON THIS ROUTE.
SELLS HIM TO THE INSIDE
AND WORKS BACK TO THE
OUTSIDE.
TUA GETS SOME PRESSURE,
THROWS IT OFF THE BACK
FOOT PERFECTLY.
WHAT A DRIVE.
AL: RILEY PATTERSON TO TIE
THE GAME AND HE DOES.
12:18 LEFT IN REGULATION.
21-21.
UNDERSTANDS WITH TYREEK
HILL.
PERFECTLY EXECUTED.
WHEN TUA HAS HAD HIS
OPPORTUNITIES TO DELIVER,
HE'S STEPPED UP AND NUMBER
10 OFTEN TONIGHT HAS BEEN
ON THE OTHER END.
AL: AND HILL WHO ENDED
LAST SEASON BY SAYING I
WANT OUT AND WALKED THAT
BACK.
HE'S HAD A BIG NIGHT.
FIVE CATCHES, 49 YARDS AND
WITH THE NEW TOUCHBACK
RULE THIS COMES OUT TO THE
35-YARD LINE FOR ALLEN AND
COMPANY.
KIRK: HERE WE GO.
I DON'T KNOW IF THE BILLS
AND THEIR FANS THOUGHT IT
WOULD BE 21-21 WITH 12:18
TO GO IN THE BALLGAME BUT
THIS IS GOING TO BE
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW
JOSH ALLEN, AS GOOD AS
ANYBODY IN THIS LEAGUE
RESPONDS, AFTER TUA JUST
TIED THIS GAME UP.
AL: MIAMI D DOING IT JOB
AGAIN TONIGHT.
SHREDDED AT INDY LAST
WEEK.
GAVE UP SCORES ON THE
FIRST THREE DRIVERS BEFORE
THEY FINALLY SETTLED DOWN
EVEN THOUGH THEY LOST THE
GAME AND TONIGHT, SOME
BIG, BIG STOPS.
START WITH THE RUN.
TRIPPED UP.
BOROM.
SEE WHERE THEY STOP IT.
ENOUGH FOR A FIRST DOWN.
KIRK: SPENCER BROWN.
THE ROOKIE JACKSON FALLS
AND OPENS THAT UP.
IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH AT
ALL.
BECAUSE OF THE VISION AND
ACCELERATION OF JAMES
COOK, HE FINDS THAT CREASE
AND HE IS GONE.
AL: 13 CARRIES, 92 YARDS
FOR COOK.
14TH CARRY, NOTHING.
KIRK: COOK, 1 TOTAL YARDS
AFTER CONTACT.
ENTERING IN DRIVER, ALMOST
SIX YARDS AFTER CONTACT
PER CARRY.
THIS GUY IS UNDERSIZED BUT
RUNS WITH GREAT HEART AND
DETERMINATION TO BECOME A
COMPLETE BACK OVER THE
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.
AL: ALLEN THROWS.
HAULED IN, 48-YARD LINE.
DODSON HANDLES COOK AT
THAT POINT, THIRD DOWN.
KIRK: MIAMI HAS MADE SOME
ADJUSTMENTS IN THIS SECOND
HALF AND THE LAST TWO
DRIVES THAT THE BILLS HAVE
HAD THE BALL, THIS DEFENSE
HAS FORCED THEM TO PUNT
THE FOOTBALL AND THEY GOT
THEM ON THIRD DOWN AGAIN.
JAELAN PHILLIPS MOVED
INSIDE HERE.
AL: ELIJAH MOORE ON LEFT
SIDE, WIDE LEFT.
ALLEN LOOKING THAT WAY,
THROWING THAT WAY AND
THAT'S INCOMPLETE.
TRYING TO GET IT TO
MOORE.
JACK JONES WITH THE
COVERAGE.
FOURTH DOWN.
KIRK: JACK JONES, WE'VE
SEEN HIM MAKE SOME PLAYS
TONIGHT AGAINST THE RUN.
WATCH HIS EYES.
SITS BACK, NOW SEE IT IS
BALL ABOUT TO BE THROWN,
THAT'S WHEN HE REACTS.
HIS BODY GETS THE RIGHT
ARM OUT IN FRONT OF THE
RECEIVER.
ANTICIPATEING THAT THROW
AND JOSH ALLEN SAYS, COME
ON, WHERE'S THE FLAG?
HE'S ON HIS BACK.
AL: THIRD STRAIGHT PUNT
FOR THE BILLS.
JOHNSTON CAME OVER FROM
PITTSBURGH.
ROBBINS GOT RELEASED.
HE TAKES OVER.
THE FLAG IS DOWN AND THE
PUNT IS GOING TO BE DOWNED
AT THE 2-YARD LINE BUT YOU
HAVE ZACH SIELER MAKING
CONTACT.
KIRK: THAT'S EXACTLY
RIGHT.
HE ROUGHED HIM.
HE BLEW HIM UP.
REFEREE: ROUGHING KICKER,
NUMBER 92.
FIRST DOWN.
PERSONAL FOUL.
92, DEFENSE.
15-YARD PENALTY, AUTOMATIC
FIRST DOWN.
KIRK: SIELER IS AN
EIGHT-YEAR VETERAN, ONE OF
THE BEST PLAYERS ON THIS
DEFENSE.
BLOWS UP THE LONG SNAPPER
AND TRIES TO MAKE A PLAY
AND BECAUSE OF THAT EFFORT
IT COSTS HIM.
CLEARLY ROUGH IT IS PUNTER
AND THE BILLS CATCH A
BREAK.
AL: GARY, YOU'RE IN
COMPLIANCE WITH THAT
CALL?
ABSOLUTELY.
AUTOMATIC 15.
KIRK: AGAIN, THE THIRD
STRAIGHT SERIES THEY WOULD
HAVE HAD JOSH ALLEN AND
THIS OFFENSE OFF THE FIELD
AND NOW YOU GIVE HIM THE
FOOTBALL AT THE 36-YARD
LINE IN A TIE GAME.
AL: MIAMI WOULD HAVE HAD
IT AT ITS OWN 2.
THAT WAS A HECK OF A PUNT
TO BEGIN WITH.
COOK.
HE TAKES IT TO THE 30-YARD
LINE.
10 MINUTES LEFT IN
REGULATION.
KIRK: YOU HAVE THIS
OFFENSE SOMEWHAT BOTTLED
UP AND YOU FEEL LIKE AT
ANY MOMENT, ESPECIALLY
AFTER A BREAK LIKE THAT,
AT ANY MOMENT THEY'RE
CAPABLE OF, WHETHER IT'S
COOK THAT HITS A CREASE
AND GOES 30 OR CATCH WITH
YOU YOUR EYES IN THE
BACKFIELD AND HIT A
PLAY-ACTION, HIT A TIGHT
END.
YOU FEEL LIKE HOW LONG CAN
YOU KEEP BOTTLING UP THIS
OFFENSE UNTIL SOMETHING IS
GOING TO GIVE?
AL: COOK AGAIN.
CUTS IT BACK BUT TRIPPED
UP.
LET'S SAY AT LEAST FOR THE
MOMENT A FIRST DOWN.
THAT'S MINKAH FITZPATRICK.
STARTED HIS CAREER WITH
THE DOLPHINS THEN COMES
BACK IN A TRADE.
JONNU RAMSEY THE OTHER --
RAPTSY THE OTHER WAY AND
JONNU SMITH AS WELL.
THIRD DOWN AND 1.
EVERY THIRD DOWN NOW BIG.
UNDER 9:00 TO PLAY.
JOHNSON, THE THIRD DOWN
BACK.
HAND IT TO HIM.
FIRST DOWN.
TY JOHNSON.
WRESTLED BACK.
GETS TO THE 20-YARD LINE.
FIRST AND 10.
KIRK: THE DOLPHINS WERE SO
CONCERNED ABOUT JOSH ALLEN
GETTING UPFIELD.
THE LEFT SIDE REALLY
DIDN'T HAVE ANYBODY TO
BLOCK.
HE WAS COMING UNDERNEATH
BECAUSE DEFENSE WAS COMING
UPFIELD SO THEY CONVERT
AND NOW DOWN TO THIS RED
ZONE AREA, THINGS GET
TIGHTER.
JOSH ALLEN, TYPICALLY THE
BALL COMES OUT QUICKER.
ALWAYS HAVE TO FACTOR IN
HIS LEGS DOWN HERE.
ESPECIALLY IN THE FOURTH
QUARTER QUARTER.
AL: ALLEN FIRES.
CAUGHT BY PALMER.
COMES OVER FROM THE
CHARGERS AFTER FOUR YEARS
THERE.
GAIN OF FIVE.
SECOND AND 5.
KIRK: HE SAW SOFT COVERAGE
ON HIS INSIDE RECEIVER.
SAID INSTEAD OF MAKING
THIS ELABORATE, LET'S JUST
TAKE THE EASY YARDS HERE,
POSITIVE YARDS.
AL: NINE DIFFERENT
RECEIVERS TONIGHT.
THEY HAD NINE IN THE
OPENER AGAINST BALTIMORE,
EIGHT LAST WEEK.
SPREADING THE WEALTH.
SECOND AND 5.
OUTSIDE TO SHAKIR.
INSIDE THE 10.
SHAKIR ALL THE WAY IN!
TOUCHDOWN, BUFFALO.
KIRK: GOOD INDICATOR THAT
THEY'VE GOT MAN-TO-MAN
COVERAGE.
BUFFALO MOTIONS, SEE HOW
THE DEFENSE RESPONDS.
NOW GET IT TO HIM QUICKLY,
A COUPLE OF BLOCKS.
KINCAID RIGHT THERE WAS
ABLE TO SEAL THE EDGE AND
THE SPEED AND QUICKNESS OF
SHAKIR TO GET UP THE FIELD
AFTER THAT RECEPTION.
EASY TOUCHDOWN FOR THE
BILLS.
AL: ALLEN NOW, 200 REGULAR
SEASON TOUCHDOWN PASSES
AND THE EXTRA POINT BY
PRATER IS GOOD.
SO THE ROUGHING THE KICKER
IS THE KILLER ON THIS
DRIVE.
28-21, BILLS.
2015 HE PLED GUILTY TO
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHARGES
STEMMING FROM HIS TIME AT
OKLAHOMA STATE.
AL: THANK YOU.
HIS CAREER.
REASON HE GOT TRADED TO
MIAMI IN THE FIRST PLACE.
THE LEAGUE INVESTIGATION.
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
THE KICK TO THE 9-YARD
LINE, ESKRIDGE UP THE
MIDDLE, TO THE 38.
KIRK: PEOPLE WONDERED WHAT
KIND OF HEART AND ATTITUDE
THEY SHOW UP WITH TONIGHT
FOR MIAMI.
HOW ABOUT OLLIE GORDON?
ALMOST 18 YARDS AFTER
CONTACT.
FOURTH AND 4.
HIT A CROSSER TO JALEN
WADDLE AND HERE THE TIMING
OFF THE PLAY-ACTION BITO
YOUA TO FIND TYREEK HILL
FOR THE TOUCHDOWN TO TIE
IT UP.
MIKE MCCADAM HAS CALLED A
HECK OF A GAME TO GIVE HIS
TEAM A CHANCE TONIGHT.
AL: FROM THE 37 ON FIRST
DOWN.
INTO A MOB.
GAIN OF A COUPLE.
SECOND DOWN AND 8.
KIRK: TUA IS NOT GOING TO
HAVE A GAME WHERE YOU LOOK
UP AND SAY OH, HE'S THROWN
FOR 350.
ONLY 105 BUT TWO
TOUCHDOWNS, MOST
IMPORTANTLY, NO TURNOVERS,
MAKING GOOD DECISIONS, NOT
FORCING BALL.
AL: TUA SPINS AROUND.
GOES DOWNFIELD AND HILL
CAN'T HOLD ON.
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN
OUT OF BOUNDS ANYWAY.
JUST OVER THE CHALK SO NOW
THIRD AND 8.
KIRK: THAT'S ONE OF THOSE
THROWS WHERE YOU'RE
THINKING WHAT HAPPENED?
HE'S LATE.
BUT THE REASON HE'S LATE
IS WATCH THE PRESSURE.
THIS IS SOMETHING YOU
MISS.
BOSA'S EFFORT MAKES HIM
HAVE TO RESET AND THAT
LITTLE RESET MAKES THE
BALL LATE AND OUT OF
BOUNDS TO A WIDE-OPEN
TYREEK HILL.
SO A PLAY YOU MIGHT NOT
REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO
BUT JOEY BOSA JUST MADE AN
IMPACT ON THAT SECOND DOWN
AND LONG.
AL: ONCE AGAIN ON THIRD
DOWN, THE CROWD RISES AS
ONE.
THIRD AND 8.
TO THE OUTSIDE.
CAUGHT.
ANOTHER BIG CATCH BY
WADDLE.
CAUGHT A TOUCHDOWN PASS,
CAUGHT A FOURTH DOWN
PASS.
KEEPS THIS DRIVE GOING.
KIRK: THERE'S THE TIMING
AGAIN WITH TUA.
THE BALL IS OUT AND
NOTHING THAT WHITE CAN DO
TO DEFEND IT.
WHEN TUA IS IN RHYTHM AND
HE GETS BACK, WITH HIS
ACCURACY AND YOU'RE
PLAYING SOFT LIKE THAT,
THAT'S PITCH AND CATCH
WERE TUA WITH HIS
RECEIVERS.
AL: BALL AT THE 50.
SIX MINUTES.
LEFT IN THE FOURTH.
TO THE OUTSIDE.
ACHANE.
GAIN OF TWO.
48-YARD LINE.
SECOND AND 8.
KIRK: I TALKED WITH FRANK
SMITH, THE OFFENSIVE
COORDINATOR FROM MIAMI
THIS WEEK AND HE MADE AN
INTERESTING POINT.
HE SAID WE WANT THE BILLS
TO FEEL OUR SPEED, MEANING
OUR GETOFF AT THE LINE OF
SCRIMMAGE AND I WAS
THINKING, OF COURSE, THE
RECEIVERS.
HE SAID YEAH, THE
RECEIVERS BUT EVEN THE
OFFENSIVE LINE.
WE WANT THEM TO PEOPLE ON
THOSE FIRST TWO OR THREE
STEPS AND HOW IT CAN SLOW
DOWN A DEFENSE AND IMPACT
AND KIND OF INTIMIDATE
THEM.
THEY'VE DONE A PRETTY GOOD
JOB OF THAT OVERALL
TONIGHT.
AL: THEY HAVE THE SPEED.
SECOND AND 8.
TUA.
THROWS.
CAUGHT.
TO THE 44.
JULIAN HILL, TACKLED THERE
FOR ANOTHER BIG THIRD
DOWN.
THIRD AND 4.
KIRK: REMEMBER, LAST TIME
THEY HAD THE BALL IN A
SIMILAR AREA IN THE
FIELD.
IT WAS A MUCH LONGER THIRD
DOWN AND THEY CALLED A
PLAY TO GET THEM TO A
FOURTH AND 3, FOURTH AND 4
SO AT THIS POINT IN THE
GAME THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
FOUR-DOWN TERRITORY.
SEE WHAT THEY COME UP WITH
HERE.
LOUDEST THIS STADIUM HAS
BEEN ALL NIGHT.
AL: A THIRD DOWN.
1-1 ON FOURTH DOWN.
TIME-OUT IS TAKEN HERE.
REFEREE: FIRST CHARGED
TIME-OUT, MIAMI.
30-SECOND TIME-OUT.
AL: WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE
THOUGHT MIAMI WAS DEAD.
A DEAD ANIMAL COMING INTO
THIS GAME BUT -- SHORT
WEEK, ALL KINDS OF STUFF
GOING ON DOWN THERE.
PLAYERS-ONLY MEETING.
FLAGS FLYING, BANNERS AND
ALL THAT.
HAD TO MAKE THE TRIP UP TO
BUFFALO.
AT LEAST THE GOOD THING
WAS, EARLY IN THE SEASON.
WHEN MIAMI COMES TO
BUFFALO, YOU WANT TO COME
IN SEPTEMBER.
KIRK: EXACTLY.
BUT, AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW
HOW THIS GAME IS GOING TO
END BUT THIS TEAM HAS
SHOWN A LOT TONIGHT
CONSIDERING EVERYTHING
THAT THEY'RE FACING.
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS
HERE IN THESE FINAL 4:40.
AL: FROM THE OUTSIDE,
ANOTHER CONVERSION AND
IT'S WADDLE AGAIN.
BIG CATCH AFTER BIG CATCH
FOR HIM TONIGHT.
KIRK: TYREEK HILL IS IN
FRONT OF HIM FORCING
BENFORD TO HAVE TO RESPECT
10
WE KNOW WHAT 10 IS CAPABLE
OF.
JUST TRAILS HIM.
ANOTHER WELL-DESPITED PLAY
BY MCDANIEL.
GOOD JOB OF GETTING BALL
OUT TO ANOTHER PLAYMAKER
AND NICE JOB BY TUA WHO
FEELS LIKE HE'S IN COMMAND
TONIGHT IN IN HOSTILE
ENVIRONMENT.
AL: FIVE CATCHES FOR
WADDLE.
ALL OF THEM IMPORTANT.
EITHER A THIRD DOWN, A
FOURTH DOWN OR A
TOUCHDOWN.
NOW OVER THE LEFT SIDE
GOES OLLIE GORDON.
GIVING UP THREE OR FOUR.
4:30 TO GO IN REGULATION.
KIRK: WE TALK ABOUT MIKE
MCDANIEL, TUA, TYREEK
HILL.
THIS IS AN OFFENSIVE LINE
THAT REALLY THE ONLY ONE
YOU KNEW WHAT YOU HAD WAS
AARON BREWER AT CENTER.
EVERYBODY ELSE IS EITHER A
FIRST-TIME STARTER OR VERY
INSPIRESSED PLAYER.
LET'S TIP OUR CAP TO THE
WAY THESE GUYS HAVE PLAYED
TONIGHT
AL: SECOND AND 6.
FAKE AND COMING AROUND,
WASHINGTON.
WASHINGTON TRYING TO GET
THAT FIRST DOWN AND DIVES
FOR IT.
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GOING
TO MARK IT JUST A LITTLE
BIT SHORT.
AND THEY DO.
KIRK: TARON JOHNSON MAKES
THAT PLAY, EVEN WITH TWO
BIG LINEMEN OUT IN FRONT.
GOOD JOB OF GETTING AROUND
HIM KEEPING HIM SHORT OF
THIS FIRST DOWN.
TUA TYPICALLY IN THE GUN.
REFEREE: FIRST DOWN.
AL: BREAK FOR MIAMI.
THEY SPOT IT NOW AT THE
22-YARD LINE AND FIRST
DOWN.
THAT'S WHAT REPLAY ASSISTS
LOOKED AT RIGHT THERE.
KIRK: GREAT JOB OF PICKING
THAT UP AS QUICKLY AS THEY
DID AND HOW ABOUT MALIK
WASHINGTON?
YOU THINK OF ANOTHER
SPEEDSTER IN THIS OFFENSE
BUT THERE HE GOT HIT, KEPT
HIS BALANCE AND THEN DOVE
FOR THAT FIRST DOWN.
AL: TUA THROWS AND IT'S
INTERCEPTED!
IT'S PICKED OFF AT ABOUT
THE 20-YARD LINE.
BERNARD WITH THE HUGE
INTERCEPTION.
KIRK: WATCH THE EYES OF
TUA.
AND WATCH HOW IT BRINGS
THE LINEBACKER OVER TO BE
ABLE TO MAKE THIS PLAY.
HIS EYES ARE LOOKING FAR
RIGHT.
THE LINEBACKER BERNARD IS
ABLE TO FEEL THAT AND
SENSE THAT AND BE ABLE TO
STEP RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE
INTENDED TARGET.
AL: AND WALKER IN HIS FACE
RAZZ HE THREW IT
KIRK: SO HERE'S THE ROUTE
WITH JAYLEN WADDLE.
HERE'S ACHANE GOING OUT IN
THE FLAT.
HERE'S THE LINEBACKER.
HE LOOKS OFF TOO HIS RIGHT
AND IN DOING SO, HE'S
TRYING TO MOVE IN DEFENDER
RIGHT HERE OUTSIDE.
HE DIDN'T EVEN TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION BERNARD.
WHEN HE LOOKED TO THE
OUTSIDE FLAT WITH ACHANE
TO MOVE THE OTHER
LINEBACKER, IT WAS A BLIND
SPOT.
HE DID NOT SEE BERNARD AS
HE TRIED TO COME BACK TO
THE INSIDE AND BERNARD
READ THE EYES, TOOK HIM
RIGHT TO THE THROWING LANE
AND MADE AN EASY
INTERCEPTION FOR HIM
BECAUSE OF THE EYES OF
TUA.
AL: SECOND BIG PLAY OF THE
SEASON FOR BERNARD TO
RECOVER DERRICK HENRY'S
FUMBLE IN THE OPENER.
BACK TO THE INSIDE GOES
ELIJAH MOORE.
FLAG IS THROWN.
AND BUFFALO IS BACKING UP.
REFEREE: HOLDING, NUMBER
86, OFFENSE.
10-YARD PENALTY FROM THE
SPOT OF THE FOUL.
FREE PLAY, FIRST DOWN.
AL: KINCAID.
KIRK: THERE HE IS RIGHT
HERE.
THIS DEFENSE HAS STEPPED
UP TIME AND TIME AGAIN.
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.
I KNOW THEY'VE GIVEN UP 28
BUT WHAT THEY WERE FACING
WITH THE INJURIES, DONE A
PRETTY GOOD JOB OF MAKING
SOME BIG PLAYS, ESPECIALLY
IN THIS SECOND HALF.
CAN THEY DO IT ONE MORE
TIME TO GET THIS MIAMI
OFFENSE A SHOT?
AL: FIRST AND 20.
ON THE GROUND.
HIT FROM BEHIND.
JAMES COOK.
IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN.
REFEREE: TIME-OUT, MIAMI.
30-SECOND TIME-OUT.
AL: 2:49.
YOU HAVE ONE MORE TIME-OUT
AND ALSO THE TWO-MINUTE
WARNING.
IF SOMEHOW MIAMI COULD
PULL IT OUT, THE UPCOMING
SCHEDULE, AT HOME, AT THE
PANTHERS.
CHARGERS, THAT'S A TOUGH
ONE AND AT CLEVELAND.
NOT MURDER REFER'S ROW.
KIRK: NOT AT ALL.
LOOK AT WHAT BUFFALO HAS
STILL COMING OFF THE BACK
END OF THIS MIAMI GAME.
AL: AND NEW ORLEANS COMES
IN HERE FOR AN AFTERNOON
GAME.
ANYWAY PLAYING SO MANY
GAMES AT NIGHT, I WAS
BEING TOLD THE TICKET
SITUATION FOR THAT GAME IS
UNLIKE ANYTHING THEY'VE
SEEN FOR A WHILE HERE.
THE CROWD IS SO USED TO
HAVING TO COME HERE AT
NIGHT, THEY CAN'T WAIT TO
COME HERE IN THE DAYTIME.
KIRK: MIAMI HAS TO GET A
STOP HERE ON THESE NEXT
TWO PLAYS.
AL: SECOND AND 16.
ALLEN STEPPING UP, FIRES,
CAUGHT.
AND OFF TO THE RACES,
INSIDE THE 40 TO THE 35
GOES ELIJAH MOORE.
HAD A TOUCHDOWN LAST
WEEK.
THAT'S A 30-YARD GAIN AND
NOW THAT PUT THEM BETWEEN
A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE
BECAUSE THEY CAN TAKE IT
DOWN TO THE TWO-MINUTE
WARNING AND THEY ONLY HAVE
ONE TIME-OUT.
KIRK: TWO DEFENDERS HERE
AND WATCH THE CORNER.
HE CLEARS OUT.
THEY HAVE THREE DEFENDERS
DEEP AND THERE'S NO ONE
LEFT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A
TACKLE ON AN EURODOLLAR
NEITHER THROW.
GOOD VISION.
GOOD JOB BY JOSH ALLEN OF
LOCATING MOORE A MUSIC]
AL: PARTY TIME IN BUFFALO.
EVERYTHING IN THEIR FAVOR
RIGHT NOW.
THE DOLPHINS SHOWED PLENTY
OF GRIT TONIGHT.
KIRK: THEY SHOWED A LOT.
I HEARD PLENTY OF NOISE.
THEY CAME OUT AND COMPETED.
IT IS A TEAM THAT AT LEAST
SHOWED THAT THEY HAVE A LOT
OF HEAD OF THEM.
IF THEY KEEP PLAYING THE WAY
THEY DID TONIGHT.
AL: HOCKEY IS ON THE
HORIZON.
SECOND AND 7.
COOK, SO MANY OF THESE GAMES
COME DOWN TO A HUGE MISTAKE.
IN THIS CASE IT WAS TO THE
ROUGHING THE PUNTER PENALTY.
KIRK: YOU HATE TO PUT IT ALL
ON THAT BUT HE WAS TRYING TO
MAKE A PLAY.
THAT IS A BIG MAN ELEVATING.
IT IS TOUGH TO HAVE BODY
CONTROL WHEN YOU ARE THAT
BIG.
HE THOUGHT HE HAD A SHOT
WITH THE LEFT HAND.
THAT GAVE JOSH ALLEN ANOTHER
OPPORTUNITY.
AND THEY ENDED UP TAKING THE
LEAD.
AL: AND THEN THE
INTERCEPTION SEALED IT.
FOURTH DOWN.
THEY DO NOT HAVE TO RUN A
PLAY UNTIL THERE IS ABOUT 25
SECONDS REMAINING.
KIRK: NEXT WEEK WITH SEATTLE
AND ARIZONA WILL BE A GOOD
ONE.
AL: ARIZONA GOING INTO SAN
FRANCISCO THIS WEEK.
SEATTLE GOT A WIN IN
PITTSBURGH.
THEY WILL RUN IT ALL AWAY
DOWN AND TAKE THE DELAY.
IF YOU GO BACKIN TAMPA.
THEY ARE GOING TO TRY THE 48
YARD FIELD GOAL HERE.
TO COMPLETELY WRAP IT UP.
PRATER, THE KICK IS GOOD.
NOT WIDE RIGHT.
THAT WAS THE FIRST.
THE CLOSEST THEY CAME.
THEY LOST FOUR IN A ROW.
THE GREAT MARV LEVY WAS THE
COACH.
KIRK: I REMEMBER THAT, I
REMEMBER THAT MOMENT, I
REMEMBER WHITNEY HOUSTON
SINGING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.
AL: THE COUNTRY WAS ONE
BECAUSE OF DESERT STORM
GOING ON.
THE FIRST TIME I WENT TO A
GAME WHERE THERE WERE
CONCRETE BARRIERS OUTSIDE
THE STADIUM.
IN TAMPA.
WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO FLY
THE BLIMP OR THE HELICOPTER.
AL: WHO WERE YOUR PARTNERS?
AL: FRANK GIFFORD AND DAN
DIERDORF.
WE DID A COUPLE OF THEM.
SEAHAWKS AND CARDINALS NEXT
WEEK.
THE RAMS AND 49ERS THE WEEK
AFTER.
MIAMI GOES BACK HOME.
IF THEY HAVE AN EXTRA THREE
DAYS TO PREPARE FOR THEIR
NEXT GAME.
BUFFALO.
WHEN YOU HAVE A GAME LIKE
THIS.
THEY DID NOT PLAY THEIR BEST
FOOTBALL.
THEY TOOK ON A TEAM THAT WAS
FIGHTING.
YOU PUT UP 31 POINTS AND
WHEN BY 10 AND YET YOU CAN
GO BACK TO THE FILM ROOM AND
THE COACH CAN LOOK AT THIS
AND SAY I HAVE A TEAM THAT
IS HUNGRY THAT WANTS TO KEEP
GETTING BETTER.
YOU CAN SHOW THEM THAT THIS
HAPPENED AND THIS HAPPENS.
IT IS GREAT EARLY IN THE
YEAR WITH YOU CAN HAVE A WIN
LIKE THIS AND YOU CAN
ADVANCE WITH A 3-0 RECORD
AND STILL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES
FOR THAT.
AL: TUA 21-32 TONIGHT.
133.
HE PUTS UP SOME MORE NUMBERS
HERE DOWN THE SIDELINE.
16 TICKS LEFT.
KIRK: JUST LIKE MIAMI HAS
SHOWN ALL NIGHT, YOU MIGHT
THINK THEY WOULD GET OUT OF
HERE, THE GAME IS OVER, BUT
THEY WILL FIGHT ALL THE WAY
TO THE END EVEN THOUGH THEY
ARE DOWN 10.
AL: PLENTY OF SMILES ON THAT
BENCH EVEN THOUGH THEY GOT A
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THEY
MIGHTVE HANDLED TONIGHT.
TRYING TO PAD THE STATUTE.
ALMOST IN INTERCEPTION.
INTENDED FOR HILL.
WHAT IS YOUR COLLEGE GAME
THIS WEEK?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
KIRK: I AM ACTUALLY GOING TO
MIAMI TONIGHT.
WE HAVE A MEETING AT 9:00
A.M.
THE HURRICANES ARE OFF TO A
PRETTY GOOD START.
THEY PLAY THE FLORIDA GATORS
DOWN IN MIAMI.
THAT SHOULD BE A FUN ONE.
AL: GOOD.
THAT IS YOUR ALZHEIMER.
SECOND AND 10.
CATCH MADE BY WASHINGTON.
THAT TAKES US TO THE END OF
THE GAME.
JOSH ALLEN WITH THREE
TOUCHDOWN PASSES.
200 IN THE REGULAR SEASON IN
HIS CAREER.
THEY DO IT AGAIN.
COMPLETELY DOMINATED THE
MIAMI DOLPHINS OVER THE LAST
SEVERAL SEASONS.
