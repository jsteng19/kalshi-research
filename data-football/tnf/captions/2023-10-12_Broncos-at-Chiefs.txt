[ct=3.672] 21-POINT DEFICIT AT SOLDIER
[ct=3.672] FIELD.
[ct=7.285] SEAN PAYTON AND ANDY REID READY
[ct=9.191] TO MATCH WITS TONIGHT.
[ct=13.276] HARRISON BUTKER TO KICKOFF,
[ct=17.185] MARVIN MIMS JR., THE VERY SPEEDY
[ct=18.505] ROOKIE WILL LET IT BOUNCE INTO
[ct=20.378] END ZONE AND THE BRONCOS
[ct=21.372] BEGIN PLAY AT THE 25 YARD LINE.
[ct=24.309] RUSSELL WILSON.
[ct=29.623] 10 YEARS IN SEATTLE, TWO SUPER
[ct=29.623] BOWL APPEARANCES, A SUPER BOWL
[ct=29.854] VICTORY.
[ct=31.128] MUCH BETTER THIS YEAR.
[ct=34.888] 5-1 TOUCHDOWN TO INTERCEPTION
[ct=37.852] RATIO AND HE HAS RUN FOR 191
[ct=40.214] YARDS.
[ct=42.610] KIRK: HE IS DOWN 15 POUNDS.
[ct=45.502] HE SAID HE FEELS LIKE HE IS IN
[ct=48.296] THE BEST SHAPE OF HIS CAREER AND
[ct=49.654] HE WILL NEED IS NIGHT.
[ct=50.193] HE WILL HAVE TO USE HIS
[ct=52.239] AVOID PRESSURE.
[ct=54.816] AL: HANDED OFF TO THE ROOKIE
[ct=57.033] MCLAUGHLIN AND WHAT A STORY HE
[ct=57.348] HAS BECOME.
[ct=60.779] A NINE YARD GAIN FOR THE GUY WHO
[ct=61.849] WAS THE ALL-TIME LEADING RUSHER
[ct=62.084] IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL.
[ct=66.287] HE PLAYED AT NOTRE DAME -- NOT
[ct=68.967] THAT NOTRE DAME -- IN OHIO AND
[ct=70.775] THEN ENDED UP AT YOUNGSTOWN
[ct=71.552] STATE AND HE HAS BEEN GREAT.
[ct=74.428] KIRK: THIS IS WHAT MAKES THE NFL
[ct=74.428] WHAT IT IS.
[ct=78.402] ALL THE SUDDEN A GUY SHOWS UP
[ct=79.430] THAT NOBODY EXPECTED ANYTHING
[ct=82.096] FROM AND HE BECOMES ONE OF THE
[ct=82.870] GREAT STORIES IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=86.835] AL: JAVONTE WILLIAMS MISSED LAST
[ct=88.207] WEEK'S GAME.
[ct=92.189] MICHAEL BURTON THE FULLBACK WILL
[ct=92.883] TAKE IT AND PICK UP THE FIRST
[ct=93.334] DOWN ON SECOND AND 1.
[ct=97.808] KIRK: SEAN PAYTON PLANS ON
[ct=100.422] TAKING SOME SHOTS DOWNFIELD.
[ct=100.645] THAT IS WHAT RUSSELL WILSON DOES
[ct=100.976] SO WELL.
[ct=102.712] YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT COACH
[ct=104.426] PAYTON IS LOOKING AT THE ABILITY
[ct=108.433] TO RUN THE FOOTBALL AGAINST
[ct=109.056] KANSAS CITY AND KEEPING NUMBER
[ct=111.374] 15 IN RED ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=115.653] AL: NOW HE HAS SAMAJE PERINE IN
[ct=116.393] THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=118.723] WE HAVE SEEN ALL THREE RUNNING
[ct=119.811] BACKS IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=123.290] THE PASS IS CAUGHT AND THAT IS
[ct=123.290] COURTLAND SUTTON.
[ct=126.780] THEY SPOT IT A LITTLE BIT SHORT
[ct=127.301] OF A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=130.125] TRENT MCDUFFIE MAKING THE TACKLE
[ct=130.346] ON THE PLAY.
[ct=133.463] KIRK: BEYOND THE NUMBERS, JUST
[ct=135.929] WATCHING HIM PLAY, EVEN BEFORE
[ct=137.027] WE STARTED TO PREP BEFORE THIS
[ct=140.236] WEEK, IT JUST LOOKS LIKE IT IS
[ct=140.464] MORE RHYTHMIC.
[ct=143.505] THE BALL IS COMING OUT FASTER
[ct=146.160] THAN WHAT WE SAW LAST YEAR, WHEN
[ct=147.910] IT TIMES HE WAS HOLDING THE BALL
[ct=148.405] HESITANT, UNSURE.
[ct=151.625] SO FAR HE AND SEAN, GREAT
[ct=153.912] COLLABORATION TO COME UP WITH A
[ct=154.397] PLAN TO MAKE HIM BETTER.
[ct=158.851] AL: PERFECTLY SNIFFED OUT, JERRY
[ct=165.507] JEUDY MAKES THE CATCH BUT
[ct=168.144] CHAMARRI CONNER IS RIGHT THERE
[ct=168.144] TO STOP HIM.
[ct=170.708] KIRK: THERE WAS A DISCUSSION
[ct=172.633] ABOUT THE WRISTBAND AND
[ct=174.771] NATHANIEL HACKETT TALKING TO
[ct=175.472] RUSSELL WILSON ABOUT USING THE
[ct=177.021] WRISTBAND, HE DECLINED.
[ct=182.562] THIS YEAR WITH SEAN PAYTON, THAT
[ct=182.989] WAS NOT NECESSARILY A DEBATE.
[ct=187.007] IT IS, "THIS IS WHAT WE ARE
[ct=189.169] GOING TO DO" BECAUSE THERE IS A
[ct=191.837] LOT OF VERBIAGE WITH THIS
[ct=193.216] OFFENSE AND IT HELPS HIM WITH
[ct=193.216] THE PLAN.
[ct=197.156] AL: PLAY CLOCK GOT RESET.
[ct=200.093] 25.
[ct=205.130] KIRK: ANOTHER TACKLE ON THE
[ct=205.689] LEFT-HAND SIDE.
[ct=207.769] THERE HE IS IN MOTION.
[ct=209.117] AL: RUNNING BACK IS JAVONTE
[ct=210.708] WILLIAMS.
[ct=214.448] HE LOVES FOR ROOM AND HE IS ABLE
[ct=218.431] TO PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN AND
[ct=218.865] GET INTO KANSAS CITY TERRITORY!
[ct=223.719] NICK BOLTON STOPPED HIM, HE HAS
[ct=225.044] MISSED THE LAST THREE GAMES, BUT
[ct=226.649] HE SCRAMBLES FREE AND PICKS UP
[ct=226.913] THE FIRST.
[ct=229.088] KIRK: YOU SEE THE EXTRA TIGHT
[ct=230.898] END IS REALLY ANOTHER TACKLE.
[ct=234.646] IT IS MAN ON MAN AND THEY
[ct=235.190] ACTUALLY GET OFF THE BLOCKS.
[ct=239.988] BOLTON, THEIR BEST TACKLER, IT
[ct=239.988] IS GREAT TO SEE HIM BACK.
[ct=241.313] IF THE TACKLE IS
[ct=243.965] SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=247.046] JAVONTE IS A PHYSICAL RUNNER AS
[ct=247.821] YOU SEE HIM BREAKING THROUGH.
[ct=253.427] AL: KEEP IT ON THE GROUND.
[ct=256.314] WILLIAMS AGAIN.
[ct=258.934] HE MISSED LAST WEEK WITH A QUAD
[ct=258.934] INJURY.
[ct=260.518] OUT OF NORTH CAROLINA.
[ct=263.401] SECOND ROUND PICK IN 2021.
[ct=266.039] KIRK: SOMETHING SEAN PAYTON IS
[ct=268.747] KNOWN FOR, NOT ONLY THE GREAT
[ct=271.028] OFFENSES WITH DREW BREES, BUT A
[ct=272.880] LOT OF PERSONNEL CHANGES,
[ct=273.082] DIFFERENT FORMATIONS.
[ct=276.846] HE HAS HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS
[ct=277.985] FOLLOWING THAT 12 TO 15 PLAY
[ct=279.791] SCRIPT AND MIXING UP A LOT OF
[ct=282.758] DIFFERENT LOOKS, TRYING TO
[ct=283.304] AFFECT THE DEFENSE AND THEIR
[ct=284.924] COMMUNICATION.
[ct=286.216] AL: MCLAUGHLIN BACK.
[ct=288.980] THE BRONCOS HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD
[ct=290.075] ON THEIR OPENING DRIVES THIS
[ct=290.292] SEASON.
[ct=292.330] SO FAR, SO GOOD.
[ct=296.331] THIS TIME, STUCK AT THE LINE OF
[ct=296.579] SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=300.274] WILLIE GAY MAKING THE TACKLE.
[ct=302.907] IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 7 AS
[ct=304.824] YOU LOOK AT STEVE SPAGNUOLO'S
[ct=305.056] DEFENSE.
[ct=306.907] KIRK: HE WILL BE PROUD OF THIS.
[ct=309.825] CHRIS JONES IN THE MIDDLE DOES A
[ct=312.240] GOOD JOB OF FIGHTING OFF A BLOCK
[ct=313.173] AND WILLIE GAY IS ABLE TO CLEAN
[ct=313.443] IT UP.
[ct=316.362] THIS DEFENSE IS PLAYING GREAT
[ct=316.362] FOOTBALL.
[ct=317.751] VERY PHYSICAL.
[ct=320.364] A LOT OF THESE GUYS IN THEIR
[ct=324.887] SECOND YEAR IN SPAG'S SYSTEM.
[ct=325.338] IDENTIFYING THINGS QUICKER AND
[ct=325.855] FLYING AROUND.
[ct=328.721] AL: THREE SUPER BOWL RINGS IN
[ct=330.038] HIS SAFE DEPOSIT BOX.
[ct=331.604] THIRD DOWN AND 7.
[ct=332.993] LOOK OUT.
[ct=336.065] WILSON GETS AWAY!
[ct=339.836] THROWS, CAUGHT INSIDE THE 40.
[ct=343.166] ADAM TRAUTMAN, THE TIGHT END.
[ct=347.652] AVOIDS DISASTER THAT TIME,
[ct=351.390] CHASED AND WILSON AVOIDS WHAT
[ct=351.859] WOULD HAVE BEEN THE 498TH
[ct=354.017] OF HIS CAREER.
[ct=355.554] KIRK: NOTHING TRICKY.
[ct=359.714] MAN ON MAN, HE GETS IN AND HAS
[ct=360.245] TO BRING HIM DOWN.
[ct=362.930] GREAT EFFORT BY RUSSELL WILSON
[ct=363.988] TO GET THAT PLAY ALIVE.
[ct=365.908] AL: FOURTH AND 3.
[ct=368.346] BALL ON THE 38.
[ct=373.456] YOU HAVE LOST 15 STRAIGHT TO
[ct=375.757] THIS TEAM, YOU ARE IN LAST
[ct=377.077] PLACE, HE IS GOING FOR IT.
[ct=378.453] MAYBE.
[ct=379.816] TIMEOUT.
[ct=382.945] AT LEAST HE WAS LINING UP TO GO
[ct=383.272] FOR IT.
[ct=387.260] REFEREE: TIMEOUT, DENVER.
[ct=388.591] THE FIRST OF THE HALF.
[ct=393.317] AL: SEAN PAYTON, 15 SEASONS IN
[ct=395.401] NEW ORLEANS, WON A SUPER BOWL IN
[ct=395.708] 2009.
[ct=399.266] HE AND DREW BREES, A MATCH MADE
[ct=399.291] IN HEAVEN.
[ct=402.211] HE WAS IN THE FOX STUDIO LAST
[ct=403.026] YEAR.
[ct=407.776] DENVER OPENED UP THE CHECKBOOK
[ct=408.614] AND HERE HE IS.
[ct=411.957] KIRK: I THINK ALL ALONG WHEN HE
[ct=414.562] STEPPED AWAY AND GOT INTO TV, AT
[ct=418.562] HIS AGE, HE STILL FEELS LIKE HE
[ct=419.983] IS IN HIS PRIME AND HAS A LOT TO
[ct=420.727] OFFER ANY ORGANIZATION.
[ct=424.179] DENVER WAS IN NEED OF A COACH
[ct=424.179] WITH A TRACK RECORD.
[ct=425.802] HE WILL DO IT HIS WAY.
[ct=428.687] HE FEELS HIS WAY IS THE RIGHT
[ct=428.964] WAY.
[ct=432.123] IT WILL BE A PROCESS AND IT WILL
[ct=432.396] TAKE TIME.
[ct=436.402] YOU HAVE TO EXPERIENCE IT TO
[ct=437.464] REALLY GROW AND THAT IS WHAT
[ct=439.024] THIS TEAM IS GOING THROUGH THESE
[ct=439.361] FIRST FIVE WEEKS.
[ct=441.486] AL: THIS WILL BE THE NINTH PLAY
[ct=441.724] OF THE DRIVE.
[ct=444.622] MICHAEL BURTON LINES UP NEXT TO
[ct=444.622] WILSON.
[ct=451.531] PRESSURE.
[ct=455.258] WILSON, SCRAMBLES AWAY AGAIN.
[ct=459.267] HE CANNOT RUN FOR THE FIRST DOWN
[ct=459.267] AND THEY TURNED THE BALL OVER.
[ct=461.921] RUN OUT BY JUSTIN REID.
[ct=468.579] GEORGE KARLAFTIS ALSO CHASING
[ct=468.814] HIM.
[ct=472.524] STYMIED WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A
[ct=475.166] DRIVE EXTENDING FIRST
[ct=480.486] HERE GO THE CHIEFS.
[ct=483.461] THEIR FIRST PLAY IS A RUN.
[ct=486.285] PACHECO, GAIN OF ABOUT 2.
[ct=488.489] ZACH ALLEN MAKES THE TACKLE.
[ct=493.302] PATRICK MAHOMES, A COUPLE OF
[ct=495.354] M.V.P. AWARDS, TWO SUPER BOWL
[ct=495.672] RINGS.
[ct=501.787] AGAINST DENVER, 11-0, 18
[ct=502.319] TOUCHDOWNS, EIGHT INTERCEPTIONS.
[ct=504.431] 15 CONSECUTIVE WINS.
[ct=507.135] SOME OF THOSE GO BACK TO ALEX
[ct=508.405] SMITH.
[ct=515.055] PACHECO AGAIN.
[ct=519.042] HE HAD A BIG DAY IN THE SUPER
[ct=519.042] BOWL.
[ct=522.374] GOOD, TOUGH RUNNING BEHIND JOE
[ct=527.082] THUNEY'S BLOCK, THE LEFT GUARD,
[ct=527.616] AND A FIRST DOWN FOR KC.
[ct=530.206] KIRK: THAT IS WHAT WILL BE
[ct=532.641] DIFFERENT FOR DEFENSES TRYING TO
[ct=532.641] DEFEND KANSAS CITY.
[ct=534.420] THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND
[ct=536.578] THEMSELVES IN THE CHEMISTRY WITH
[ct=536.886] THE RECEIVERS.
[ct=540.609] PACHECO IN HIS SECOND YEAR, HE
[ct=541.302] EXPLODED ONTO THE SCENE LAST
[ct=542.418] YEAR AS A SEVENTH ROUNDER.
[ct=545.018] NOW YOU KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM
[ct=547.104] HE GIVES A BALANCED ATTACK.
[ct=550.903] IN THE PAST, DEFENSES WERE MORE
[ct=552.315] WORRIED ABOUT MAHOMES AND THE
[ct=552.647] PASS GAME.
[ct=556.102] AL: OPEN AND THEN A LITTLE FLIP
[ct=561.387] BACK FOR KELCE AS HE SENDS IT TO
[ct=561.387] NOAH GRAY.
[ct=563.549] ONE TIGHT END TO ANOTHER.
[ct=565.170] ANOTHER FIRST DOWN.
[ct=570.659] KIRK: MATT MOORE AND TONY NATHAN
[ct=571.212] GOING WAY BACK TO THE DOLPHINS
[ct=571.548] AGAINST THE CHARGERS.
[ct=576.062] HOW CALM IS KELCE?
[ct=578.718] HE JUST WAITS FOR HIS GUY.
[ct=582.758] HE IS JUST OUT THERE IN PRACTICE
[ct=583.022] HAVING FUN.
[ct=585.027] HE USED TO BE A QUARTERBACK.
[ct=588.723] PERFECT PITCH TO NOAH GRAY AND A
[ct=589.368] FIRST DOWN FOR THE CHIEFS.
[ct=592.641] AL: HOOK AND LADDER, HOOK AND
[ct=594.299] TRAILER, TAKE YOUR PICK.
[ct=596.577] FIRST DOWN FROM THE 36 YARD
[ct=596.577] LINE.
[ct=598.034] ROLLING.
[ct=599.890] LOOKS ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE
[ct=600.956] FIELD, NOTHING THERE.
[ct=604.995] THEN HE THROWS AND IT IS CAUGHT
[ct=605.304] INSIDE THE 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=608.035] THERE IS HIS MAIN MAN AGAIN,
[ct=608.348] KELCE.
[ct=610.885] HE CAME OUT WITH A SPRAINED
[ct=612.785] ANKLE LAST WEEK, HE WAS SO
[ct=613.056] FRUSTRATED.
[ct=616.823] THREW HIS HELMET DOWN, IT LOOKED
[ct=617.724] LIKE HE WOULD BE DOWN A WHILE.
[ct=618.103] NO.
[ct=622.158] KIRK: HE KIND OF FEELS IT AND
[ct=624.599] SEES THE LEVERAGE IS TAKEN AWAY
[ct=627.814] TO THE INSIDE SO HE CALMLY WORKS
[ct=627.814] BACK TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=630.940] THE WAY MAHOMES AND HE ARE
[ct=631.221] ALWAYS IN SYNC.
[ct=634.446] AL: ALREADY TWO CATCHES FOR HIM.
[ct=636.386] LOOKING FOR SPACE, PACHECO.
[ct=639.723] HE WILL PICK UP A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=648.322] THE MAN WHO TOOK OVER FOR CLYDE
[ct=650.143] EDWARDS-HELAIRE ABOUT HALFWAY
[ct=650.540] THROUGH LAST SEASON.
[ct=653.804] VANCE JOSEPH AND THE DEFENSE IS
[ct=654.905] NEAR THE BOTTOM IN EVERY
[ct=654.905] CATEGORY.
[ct=658.079] HE HAS TAKEN A TON OF HEAT IN
[ct=658.353] DENVER.
[ct=660.246] TRYING TO GET SOMETHING GOING.
[ct=663.485] KIRK: THE CHALLENGE HE HAS,
[ct=665.083] GIVING UP EXPLOSIVES, DEALING
[ct=665.653] WITH MAHOMES.
[ct=669.170] AL: KNOCK DOWN AND INCOMPLETE.
[ct=673.519] JA QUAN MCMILLAN, SECOND YEAR
[ct=673.812] MAN OUT OF EAST
[ct=676.781] IT WILL BE SECOND AND 10.
[ct=678.624] KIRK: PEOPLE WHO DEFEND MAHOMES
[ct=683.747] SIT BACK WITH TWO SAFETIES DEEP.
[ct=686.020] THE PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU ARE
[ct=688.267] STRUGGLING TO STOP THE RUN --
[ct=690.271] DEAD LAST IN THE LEAGUE STOPPING
[ct=693.035] THE RUN -- YOU NEED TO SAFETIES
[ct=693.379] TO COME DOWN AND HELP WITH THE
[ct=693.748] RUN.
[ct=697.118] THAT IS THE CAT AND MOUSE GAME
[ct=697.493] FOR VANCE JOSEPH.
[ct=700.564] AL: GIVING UP 36 POINTS PER
[ct=702.704] GAME.
[ct=702.704] OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=707.874] TAKEN DOWN AT THE 18 YARD LINE,
[ct=711.419] RASHEE RICE, ROOKIE OUT OF SMU,
[ct=712.783] SECOND ROUNDER.
[ct=715.141] MAHOMES LOVES TO SPREAD IT
[ct=715.141] AROUND.
[ct=719.461] FOUR OUT OF THE FIVE GAMES, HE
[ct=719.769] HAS HIT 10 OR MORE RECEIVERS.
[ct=722.625] KIRK: AS THE SEASON GOES ON,
[ct=724.490] RASHEE RICE WILL BECOME A GO TO
[ct=724.490] GUY.
[ct=727.130] STILL A ROOKIE, FEELING THINGS
[ct=727.130] OUT.
[ct=730.782] OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE, HE
[ct=733.063] STARTS TO PEEK.
[ct=734.815] HE CAME BACK AND MADE A PERFECT
[ct=735.173] THROW.
[ct=737.071] AL: THIRD AND 3.
[ct=742.512] THAT IS BATTED AT THE LINE OF
[ct=744.837] THAT SETS UP A FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=748.709] MIKE PURCELL BATTING IT DOWN,
[ct=749.413] NUMBER 98.
[ct=752.694] HARRISON BUTKER WILL COME INTO
[ct=755.068] TRY TO MAKE IT A 3-0 GAME.
[ct=757.672] KIRK: HE IS A BIG FELLA.
[ct=759.946] TRYING TO GET IT OUT TO THE
[ct=761.785] RIGHT TO KADARIUS TONEY.
[ct=763.932] THAT WOULD BE A FIRST DOWN HE
[ct=768.653] GOT IT OVER PURCELL BUT PURCEELL
[ct=769.267] MAKES A NICE PLAY.
[ct=772.134] AL:AL: HERE IS HARRISON BUTKER.
[ct=775.348] HE HAS MISSED ONLY ONE, FROM 51
[ct=777.507] THE WIND IS SWIRLING.
[ct=781.969] THAT KICK IS GOOD.
[ct=783.697] FLUTTERING THROUGH.
[ct=786.617] IT WILL BE THAT KIND OF NIGHT
[ct=787.033] WITH EVERY KICK TONIGHT.
[ct=795.635] THIS IS GAME NUMBER 419, REGULAR
[ct=797.877] SEASON AND POSTSEASON, IN THE
[ct=799.076] HISTORY OF THIS BUILDING.
[ct=803.349] OPENING UP IN 1972.
[ct=805.292] RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO WHERE THE
[ct=808.566] ROYALS HAVE PLAYED SINCE ABOUT
[ct=809.025] THAT SAME TIME.
[ct=812.442] KIRK: YOU THINK YOU HAVE CALLED
[ct=814.012] MORE GAMES HERE?
[ct=815.313] AL: A LOT.
[ct=817.664] KIRK: A LOT OF PLAYOFF GAMES.
[ct=820.944] AL: PRESEASON GAMES.
[ct=823.672] TOUCHBACK HERE.
[ct=827.647] I EVEN CALLED AGAIN HERE,
[ct=827.960] BELIEVE IT OR NOT, WITH HANK
[ct=830.755] STRAM, THE YEAR AFTER HE GOT
[ct=832.219] FIRED AS THE KANSAS CITY COACH.
[ct=835.219] THE TOWN WAS GOING CRAZY AT THAT
[ct=835.572] POINT.
[ct=842.476] HANK WANTED TO KNOW IF SOMETHING
[ct=844.105] HAD BEEN MOVED IN HIS OFFICE.
[ct=845.962] KIRK: WHAT WAS THE ANSWER?
[ct=848.645] AL: I SAID YES, HE DID.
[ct=850.871] HE WAS NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT.
[ct=853.133] KIRK: THIS IS A PASSIONATE FAN
[ct=853.468] BASE.
[ct=855.120] AL: VERY.
[ct=858.164] RUNNING BACK IS JAVONTE
[ct=864.342] THERE HE GOES, BIG HOLE.
[ct=867.928] EXPLOITS THAT BABY.
[ct=870.525] TOUGH RUNNING FOR A GAIN OF 18
[ct=873.780] MICHAEL BURTON, THE FULLBACK,
[ct=874.144] LED THE WAY.
[ct=877.258] KIRK: A NICE JOB ON THE RIGHT
[ct=877.621] SIDE, AS WELL.
[ct=879.583] WATCH THIS DOUBLE-TEAMED.
[ct=881.603] OPENS UP A BLOCK FOR THE
[ct=885.592] FULLBACK BURTON, WHICH YOU
[ct=888.227] MENTIONED.
[ct=888.227] I DO NOT THINK THE NFL HAS SEEN
[ct=890.229] WHAT JAVONTE WILLIAMS CAN DO
[ct=890.568] WHEN HE IS HEALTHY.
[ct=894.510] 220 POUNDS AND BRINGS A LOT OF
[ct=894.866] PHYSICALITY.
[ct=900.700] AL: HE TORE HIS ACL IN THE
[ct=902.331] FOURTH WEEK LAST SEASON AND WAS
[ct=902.331] DONE FOR THE SEASON.
[ct=903.661] PLAY-ACTION.
[ct=904.958] GOOD POCKET.
[ct=907.060] INTERCEPTED AT THE 42 YARD LINE.
[ct=910.103] NICK BOLTON, RIGHT THERE.
[ct=911.987] INTENDED FOR JERRY JEUDY.
[ct=915.960] DOWN INTO THE END ZONE THEY GO,
[ct=916.571] THE DEFENSE, TO CELEBRATE.
[ct=918.986] WILSON THREW IT RIGHT TO HIM AND
[ct=921.147] KC GETS IT.
[ct=922.438] 3-0, CHIEFS.
[ct=933.346] KIRK: DENVER GOES WITH A PLAY TO
[ct=934.313] TRY TO GO HERE.
[ct=936.617] THEY ARE TRYING TO AFFECT THE
[ct=936.983] BACKER.
[ct=939.996] WATCH OUT NICK BOLTON PLAYS
[ct=939.996] THIS.
[ct=942.658] KEEP IN MIND HE HAS BEEN OUT FOR
[ct=944.004] THREE WEEKS.
[ct=946.136] HE SEES THE BACK GOING HERE AND
[ct=947.273] RIGHT AWAY HE GETS HIS HEAD ON A
[ct=947.596] SWIVEL.
[ct=950.013] HE IS ABLE TO LOOK BACK AND
[ct=951.574] RECOGNIZE, HERE IS THE ROUTE.
[ct=955.937] HE READS THE EYES OF RUSSELL
[ct=956.573] WILSON AND I RUSSELL WILSON
[ct=958.910] MIGHT HAVE PREDETERMINED WHERE
[ct=959.203] TO GO WITH THAT FOOTBALL.
[ct=965.545] AL: WIDE OPEN, KELCE.
[ct=968.183] STIFF-ARMING DOWN THE SIDELINE.
[ct=969.821] A LONG GAIN.
[ct=971.835] RUN OUT BY JUSTIN SIMMONS.
[ct=976.182] IT IS JUST ASTONISHING HOW OPEN
[ct=977.902] THIS GUY GETS WHEN EVERYONE
[ct=980.128] KNOWS HE WILL GET THE PASS.
[ct=982.130] NOW YOU HAVE A FLAG AT THE END
[ct=982.471] OF THE PLAY.
[ct=986.686] REFEREE: BEFORE THE PASS WAS
[ct=989.453] THROWN, HOLDING, DEFENSE, NUMBER
[ct=989.453] 27.
[ct=992.290] THIS PENALTY IS DECLINED IN THE
[ct=992.937] PLAY RESULTS IN THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=994.526] KIRK: THEY CLEAR OUT.
[ct=997.487] HE JUST KIND OF WORKS HIMSELF
[ct=997.911] ACROSS THE FIELD.
[ct=999.942] WITH MAN-TO-MAN ON THE RIGHT
[ct=1002.635] WITH MATHIS, THERE IS NOBODY
[ct=1003.078] OVER THERE.
[ct=1007.603] DOES IT EVER SURPRISE EVEN YOU
[ct=1011.501] GUYS THAT 87 ON YOUR BALLCLUB
[ct=1012.518] ALWAYS SEEMS TO GET OPEN?
[ct=1014.121] AL: IT IS CRAZY.
[ct=1018.118] HE IS OPEN BY 10 YARDS ON SO
[ct=1018.118] MANY CATCHES.
[ct=1020.743] AT THE 17 YARD LINE.
[ct=1025.829] KIRK: GET HIM BACK OVER THERE.
[ct=1027.577] AL: BRING HIM BACK.
[ct=1033.810] TONEY, THAT GOES NOWHERE.
[ct=1037.837] MCMILLAN MAKES THE TACKLE.
[ct=1041.381] LOSS ON THE PLAY OF THREE,
[ct=1041.751] SECOND AND 13.
[ct=1044.362] KIRK: THE EDGE OF THE DEFENSE
[ct=1044.744] HAS BEEN A PROBLEM.
[ct=1048.161] IT IS SOMETHING VANCE JOSEPH HAS
[ct=1048.541] EMPHASIZED.
[ct=1051.427] THIS WEEK COMING AGAINST THIS
[ct=1052.581] QUICK HITTING OFFENSE, THEY LIKE
[ct=1053.353] TO GET THE BALL TO THE
[ct=1053.764] PERIMETER.
[ct=1056.848] RUSS HOPING THIS DEFENSE HOLDS
[ct=1058.809] UP AGAIN AND FORCES A FIELD
[ct=1059.145] GOAL.
[ct=1066.515] AL: GOOD POCKET.
[ct=1067.899] PASS CAUGHT.
[ct=1071.620] 15 YARD LINE AND WRESTLED DOWN.
[ct=1075.030] PACHECO WRESTLED DOWN BY JOSEY
[ct=1076.078] JEWELL AND ALEX SINGLETON.
[ct=1079.084] IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 8
[ct=1079.864] AFTER A GAIN OF 5.
[ct=1083.021] KIRK: THIS IS A TEAM THAT HAS
[ct=1085.047] STRUGGLED WITH MISSED TACKLES,
[ct=1085.359] MOST IN THE NFL.
[ct=1089.017] RIGHT NOW ON A SHORT WEEK, A
[ct=1091.803] COUPLE SERIES IN, EVERYONE
[ct=1093.066] GETTING THEIR FEET UNDER THEM
[ct=1093.767] AND GETTING THE FEEL FOR WHAT IS
[ct=1095.703] COMING AT THEM AND THEY ARE
[ct=1096.148] HOLDING UP PRETTY WELL.
[ct=1096.848] LET’
[ct=1097.521] LET'S SEE IF THEY GET PRESSURE
[ct=1098.891] ON MAHOMES ON THIRD DOWN.
[ct=1101.608] AL: JERICK MCKINNON IN THE
[ct=1101.978] BACKFIELD.
[ct=1105.563] THREE RECEIVER SET TO THE RIGHT
[ct=1105.947] SIDE.
[ct=1111.499] MAHOMES, PRESSURE, LOOK OUT.
[ct=1115.521] HE GETS IT AWAY AND SLINGS IT
[ct=1116.459] AND IT IS PICKED OFF AT THE GOAL
[ct=1116.712] LINE!
[ct=1118.843] JUSTIN SIMMONS.
[ct=1122.787] SO, DENVER IS ABLE TO HOLD THEM.
[ct=1127.139] YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO DOWN 10-0
[ct=1127.139] ON THE ROAD.
[ct=1130.159] THEY KEEP IT AT 3-0 AND THEY GET
[ct=1130.546] THE BALL BACK.
[ct=1133.763] HE WAS UNDER PRESSURE, I THOUGHT
[ct=1134.572] HE WAS TRYING TO THROW IT AWAY.
[ct=1138.169] SIMMONS COMES UP WITH THE PICK.
[ct=1142.213] WITH 2:55 TO GO IN THE QUARTER,
[ct=1142.599] DENVER WITH THE BALL.
[ct=1151.589] KIRK: USUALLY THIS LOOK WITHAL,
[ct=1156.776] TWO SAFETIES HIGH, THIS BACK
[ct=1156.776] WILL RUN WITH HIM.
[ct=1157.708] HE DOES NOT.
[ct=1159.273] MAHOMES LOCKED IN.
[ct=1162.129] HE WANTED TO GET INTO KELCE BUT
[ct=1162.825] THEY SQUEEZED HIM.
[ct=1165.206] HE ACTUALLY GOT HIT WHILE HE
[ct=1165.691] RELEASED IT.
[ct=1168.640] THE BALL GOES UP
[ct=1170.013] INTERCEPTION BY THE DENVER
[ct=1174.380] IF HE IS IN TACKLE, HE MIGHT
[ct=1175.091] HAVE TAKEN THAT BACK.
[ct=1177.429] AL: FROM THE SEVEN YARD LINE.
[ct=1182.693] 4-YARD GAIN.
[ct=1185.653] KAYLEE: NO ONE HAS INTERCEPTED
[ct=1187.327] PATRICK MAHOMES MORE THAN JUSTIN
[ct=1187.327] SIMMONS.
[ct=1189.703] THAT MAKES FOUR.
[ct=1193.036] SIMMONS TOLD ME THE KEY IS BEING
[ct=1194.415] IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT
[ct=1195.685] TIME AND BEING DISCIPLINED EVEN
[ct=1197.301] WHEN MAHOMES BREAKS THE POCKET.
[ct=1199.891] LAST YEAR AFTER HE GRABBED HIS
[ct=1202.543] THIRD PICK, HE SAID MAHOMES JOKE
[ct=1203.892] WITH HIM THAT I LOVE THROWING
[ct=1203.892] YOU THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=1206.006] HE SAID I WILL NOT COMPLAIN.
[ct=1208.595] AL: THAT IS HIS FIRST PICK THIS
[ct=1211.898] SIMMONS HAS BEEN WITH THE
[ct=1213.294] BRONCOS FOR EIGHT YEARS.
[ct=1216.024] HE SAID HE IS SICK OF LOSING.
[ct=1220.760] A GOOD LITTLE CUTBACK AND THE
[ct=1221.008] BALL IS OUT!
[ct=1223.565] IS IT OUT AFTER THE PLAY WAS
[ct=1225.845] OVER, IS THE QUESTION?
[ct=1227.719] KANSAS CITY THINK THAT WAS.
[ct=1229.915] THE OFFICIALS COME IN AND SAY,
[ct=1233.845] THEY DO SAY IT IS A FUMBLE.
[ct=1237.478] CHECK THAT BABY OUT.
[ct=1239.461] DRUE TRANQUILL.
[ct=1241.773] THEY WILL REVIEW THIS.
[ct=1246.317] REFEREE: AFTER DISCUSSION, THE
[ct=1247.104] RUNNER WAS DOWN BY CONTACT.
[ct=1250.345] IT IS DENVER'S BALL.
[ct=1253.498] KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAD
[ct=1254.175] POSSESSION OF THAT FOOTBALL.
[ct=1257.991] REFEREE: IT IS THIRD DOWN AND
[ct=1258.326] SHORT.
[ct=1261.802] AL: HE GOT THE WORD FROM ABOVE.
[ct=1264.319] IT WAS NOT A FUMBLE.
[ct=1266.852] THEY GET AWAY WITH IT HERE WITH
[ct=1269.581] 2 MINUTES TO GO IN THE QUARTER.
[ct=1272.540] HE IS A LITTLE SHORT OF THE
[ct=1272.956] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1274.879] IT IS THIRD DOWN AND 1.
[ct=1279.845] KIRK: GREAT JOB BY THE OFFICIALS
[ct=1281.042] COMING TOGETHER AND MAKING THE
[ct=1281.042] RIGHT CALL.
[ct=1284.975] AL: WHY REVIEW IT WHEN YOU GET
[ct=1286.184] THE WORD FROM UPSTAIRS?
[ct=1288.208] IT IS SIMPLER.
[ct=1291.175] MIKE THE PITCH CLOCK IN
[ct=1291.634] BASEBALL, IT MAKES IT MUCH
[ct=1292.180] EASIER.
[ct=1293.750] THIRD DOWN AND 1.
[ct=1296.698] JAVONTE WILLIAMS IS THE RUNNING
[ct=1296.986] BACK.
[ct=1301.018] AND WILSON WILL SNEAK AHEAD OVER
[ct=1302.819] THE RIGHT GUARD TO PICK UP A
[ct=1309.430] WHAT DO YOU THINK -- WE LOOKED
[ct=1312.337] AT RUSSELL WILSON PLAYING --
[ct=1313.484] WHAT DID YOU THINK WAS THE
[ct=1316.244] DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT HE WAS
[ct=1317.372] IN SEATTLE AND WHAT THEY TRY TO
[ct=1318.010] DO WITH HIM LAST YEAR?
[ct=1320.060] KIRK: I THINK HE WAS SITTING IN
[ct=1322.194] THE POCKET AND STRUGGLING TO SEE
[ct=1322.671] COVERAGE.
[ct=1324.554] I THINK THIS YEAR THEY HAVE GONE
[ct=1325.670] BACK TO WHAT WORKS.
[ct=1328.215] THEY WILL MOVE HIM ON THE LAUNCH
[ct=1331.585] THE BALL IS EITHER OUT QUICKLY
[ct=1333.758] WITH THE QUICK GAME, GET HIM OUT
[ct=1336.226] ON THE EDGES, AND TAKING SHOTS
[ct=1336.591] DOWNFIELD.
[ct=1340.349] AL: JERRY JEUDY TO THE 20.
[ct=1344.810] JEUDY BEING TALKED ABOUT AS A
[ct=1347.540] GUY IF THEY ARE GOING TO TRADE
[ct=1350.662] AND PICK UP DRAFT CHOICES -- THE
[ct=1351.449] TRADE DEADLINE IS AT THE END OF
[ct=1353.675] THE MONTH -- HE IS ONE OF THE
[ct=1354.400] GUY THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.
[ct=1357.288] KIRK: HE HAS HAD MOMENTS THAT
[ct=1358.116] WERE GOOD BUT HE HAS NOT BEEN
[ct=1358.438] CONSISTENT.
[ct=1359.794] THEY NEED HIM TONIGHT.
[ct=1362.107] YOU LOOK AT THE RECEIVERS.
[ct=1366.140] SUTTON, MIMS.
[ct=1368.679] AT SOME POINT YOU WILL TAKE SOME
[ct=1370.714] VERTICAL SHOTS AND
[ct=1372.027] RECEIVERS WILL HAVE TO MAKE SOME
[ct=1372.027] BIG PLAYS.
[ct=1373.677] AL: SECOND AND 8.
[ct=1376.763] GOOD, TOUGH RUNNING.
[ct=1379.391] MCLAUGHLIN CAME INTO THE GAME
[ct=1380.720] AVERAGING OVER 7 YARDS PER
[ct=1382.662] CARRY.
[ct=1384.253] THE LEAGUE AVERAGE IS 4.2.
[ct=1387.719] YOUNGSTOWN STATE, UNDRAFTED FREE
[ct=1387.719] AGENT.
[ct=1392.526] LIGHTED IT UP IN TRAINING CAMP
[ct=1392.969] AND EVERYONE FELL IN LOVE W
[ct=1395.076] KIRK: HE IS ABOUT A HUNDRED 85
[ct=1395.076] POUNDS.
[ct=1398.592] HE HAS BEEN DETERMINED SINCE HE
[ct=1399.051] SHOWED UP AT DAY 1.
[ct=1401.036] HE GOT THERE AT 6:00 IN THE
[ct=1403.094] MORNING AND WANTED TO SEE THE
[ct=1403.446] SCRIPT.
[ct=1405.165] THIS WAS WHEN HE DID NOT SEE ANY
[ct=1406.093] REPS.
[ct=1409.437] HE JUST KEPT HANGING AROUNDA FEW
[ct=1411.260] ARROWHEAD.
[ct=1414.013] START THE SECOND QUARTER WITH A
[ct=1416.032] THIRD DOWN AND 1 FOR DENVER AND
[ct=1418.233] THEY GIVE IT TO THE UPBACK AND
[ct=1418.551] HE WILL NOT GET IT.
[ct=1421.692] THEY GIVE IT TO BURTON, CANNOT
[ct=1422.080] GET IT.
[ct=1424.587] FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=1427.916] KIRK: WHAT A TREMENDOUS EFFORT,
[ct=1428.624] SHORT YARDAGE.
[ct=1431.345] WATCH THIS MOVE RIGHT HERE BY
[ct=1431.345] 94.
[ct=1434.113] YOU DO NOT HEAR ABOUT HIM AS
[ct=1436.142] MUCH BUT THE QUICKNESS OFF THE
[ct=1438.397] BALL, SHOOTS THAT GAP AND JUST
[ct=1441.342] EXPLODES.
[ct=1441.780] THE TIGHT END NEEDS TO COME DOWN
[ct=1441.780] AND HELP.
[ct=1443.743] BURTON NEVER HAD A CHANCE.
[ct=1446.753] AL: RILEY DIXON IS THE DENVER
[ct=1447.029] PUNTER.
[ct=1449.061] LINE DRIVE KICK.
[ct=1455.258] FIELDED AT HIS KNEECAPS BY
[ct=1457.687] MONTRELL I WOULD SAY THAT IS CLU
[ct=1458.245] ELITE.
[ct=1461.229] KIRK: HIS FIRST FIVE YEARS AS A
[ct=1461.229] STARTER.
[ct=1463.327] HE HAD THE ONE START AS A
[ct=1463.764] ROOKIE.
[ct=1467.168] FIVE YEARS, FIVE AFC
[ct=1468.395] CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES.
[ct=1473.005] AL: HERE IS ISIAH PACHECO OUT TO
[ct=1473.363] THE 49 YARD LINE.
[ct=1476.169] KIRK: MAHOMES HAS TALKED ABOUT
[ct=1477.269] BEING PATIENT AND NOT TAKING
[ct=1480.118] CHANCES, NOT TRYING TO MAKE
[ct=1480.517] SOMETHING HAPPEN.
[ct=1483.500] OF COURSE, HE DID THAT ON THE
[ct=1483.828] SECOND POSSESSION.
[ct=1486.938] HIS DEFENSE HAS PUT HIM IN A
[ct=1488.887] GOOD SPOT.
[ct=1489.629] THEY ARE STARTING AT THEIR OWN
[ct=1492.639] 41, 43 AND 43 UNDER THIRD
[ct=1494.645] POSSESSION BUT ONLY 3 POINT SO
[ct=1494.645] FAR.
[ct=1496.357] AL: SECOND AND 5.
[ct=1500.412] PACHECO AGAIN, COMING IN FROM
[ct=1503.427] THE CORNER WAS PATRICK SURTAIN,
[ct=1504.097] ONE OF THE BEST IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=1504.807] THIRD YEAR.
[ct=1508.685] NUMBER 1 PICK FROM ALABAMA.
[ct=1510.310] IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 5.
[ct=1515.122] KIRK: SURTAIN GETS A LOT OF
[ct=1518.115] RECOGNITION BECAUSE HE IS SUCH A
[ct=1519.115] GIFTED COVER CORNER BUT FOLKS
[ct=1521.596] AROUND THE LEAGUE LOVE HIS
[ct=1527.936] ABILITIES AT 6'2", 202 BECAUSE
[ct=1529.505] OF PLAYS LIKE THAT, A GREAT JOB
[ct=1529.947] IN RUN SUPPORT.
[ct=1531.650] AL: COMING ACROSS THE LINE.
[ct=1534.768] WHO WENT FIRST IS THE QUESTION.
[ct=1537.247] PERKINS RIGHT OVER DONOVAN
[ct=1543.482] REFEREE: NEUTRAL ZONE
[ct=1545.871] INFRACTION, DEFENSE, NUMBER 51.
[ct=1548.857] THIS FIVE YARD PENALTY RESULTS
[ct=1549.321] IN A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1552.300] AL: IT IS PERKINS ON WHAT WOULD
[ct=1553.185] HAVE BEEN A THIRD AND 5.
[ct=1555.672] KIRK: I THINK THIS IS ALL
[ct=1557.074] BECAUSE OF MAHOMES KNOWING THE
[ct=1559.832] SITUATION, REALIZING THE HARD
[ct=1562.610] COUNT COULD POTENTIALLY DRAW
[ct=1562.616] SOMEBODY OFF.
[ct=1564.113] RIGHT THERE.
[ct=1566.936] RONNIE PERKINS NOT PLAYING A
[ct=1567.321] LOT.
[ct=1569.898] WHEN HE GETS IN, HE IS EAGER.
[ct=1575.523] AL: CHIEFS’
[ct=1578.161] AL: CHIEFS' FIFTH FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1583.658] THE FAKE, PASS, KADARIUS TONEY.
[ct=1585.675] CAME OVER FROM THE GIANTS.
[ct=1588.190] SURTAIN IS COVERING ON THE PLAY.
[ct=1590.314] THAT WILL MAKE IT SECOND DOWN
[ct=1590.661] AND 5.
[ct=1593.859] KIRK: VANCE JOSEPH TELLING US
[ct=1596.889] THIS WEEK, WE HAVE TO MAKE GAME
[ct=1599.233] CHANGING PLAYS.
[ct=1599.545] THAT IS WHAT THEY DID ON THE
[ct=1599.943] LAST POSSESSION.
[ct=1601.784] HE HAS BEEN AS FRUSTRATED AS
[ct=1602.122] ANYONE.
[ct=1604.985] THE MEDIA GETS UPSET, FANS GET
[ct=1607.810] UPSET, I DO NOT KNOW IF ANYONE
[ct=1608.584] HAS BEEN MORE UPSET THE WAY
[ct=1609.885] THINGS HAVE GONE THAN VANCE
[ct=1610.973] JOSEPH.
[ct=1613.412] DETERMINED TO GET IT RIGHT.
[ct=1613.726] OFF TO A GOOD START TONIGHT.
[ct=1617.094] AL: MAHOMES CHASED OUT, FLAG
[ct=1617.094] THROWN.
[ct=1621.105] GOES DEEP AND THROWS THAT AWAY.
[ct=1622.290] NOBODY IS HOME.
[ct=1629.471] FLAG IN THE OFFENSIVE BACKFIELD.
[ct=1634.318] REFEREE: HOLDING, OFFENSE,
[ct=1634.672] NUMBER 74.
[ct=1638.429] 10 YARD PENALTY, REPLAY SECOND
[ct=1638.875] DOWN.
[ct=1642.968] AL: THE DENVER DEFENSE, AT LEAST
[ct=1645.119] TO THIS POINT, KEEPING THEM VERY
[ct=1645.482] MUCH IN THE GAME.
[ct=1647.118] KIRK: ALL THREE OF THESE
[ct=1651.612] POSSESSIONS CLOSE TO MIDFIELD.
[ct=1652.225] UP TO THIS POINT, THEY HAVE PUT
[ct=1652.550] A PLAN TOGETHER.
[ct=1653.466] YOU LOOK AT THESE TWO TEAMS ON
[ct=1657.159] PAPER, DENVER WILL HAVE THEIR
[ct=1657.479] HANDS FULL AGAINST MAHOMES.
[ct=1660.693] BUT THEY SHOW UP ON A SHORT WEEK
[ct=1661.158] WITH A GOOD PLAN.
[ct=1663.826] THEY ARE PLAYING A LOT FASTER.
[ct=1666.206] AL: NOT EASY, EITHER.
[ct=1669.688] YOU LOSE A GAME ON SUNDAY, YOU
[ct=1672.074] HAVE MONDAY AND TUESDAY AT HOME,
[ct=1673.552] YOU FLY ON WEDNESDAY AND YOU ARE
[ct=1674.495] PLAYING THE WORLD CHAMPS ON
[ct=1674.898] THURSDAY.
[ct=1678.852] A NICE HOLE, THAT IS CLYDE
[ct=1678.864] EDWARDS-HELAIRE.
[ct=1681.539] A COUPLE YEARS AGO HE LOOKED
[ct=1683.479] LIKE HE WOULD BE THEIR ACE
[ct=1684.649] RUNNING BACK A LONG TIME.
[ct=1686.829] IT LASTED AS LONG AS IT TOOK FOR
[ct=1688.779] ISIAH PACHECO TO GET IN THE
[ct=1691.984] KIRK: GOING INTO LAST YEAR, A
[ct=1692.710] LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT HE WAS THE
[ct=1695.005] GUY BUT ONCE PACHECO SHOWED WHEN
[ct=1695.682] HE COULD DO -- WHAT DID MAHOMES
[ct=1697.276] TELL US?
[ct=1700.538] HE RUNS LIKE HE IS ANGRY AT THE
[ct=1700.993] GROUND.
[ct=1703.521] THAT IS HOW PHYSICAL AND HOW
[ct=1703.872] TOUGH HE RUNS.
[ct=1706.951] I HAVE HEARD RUNNING ANGRY BUT
[ct=1708.666] NOT RUNNING ANGRY AT THE GROUND.
[ct=1710.774] AL: THAT IS A GREAT DESCRIPTION.
[ct=1713.997] THIRD AND 8.
[ct=1716.955] MAHOMES STEPPING UP, LOOK OUT
[ct=1717.391] FROM BEHIND.
[ct=1718.886] HIT AS HE THROWS.
[ct=1721.784] KOK, FIRST DOWN WHO ELSE?
[ct=1725.474] 87, KELCE.
[ct=1728.575] MAHOMES IS CHASED FROM BEHIND ON
[ct=1731.316] THE NEXT AGAIN NO, THEY ARE ON
[ct=1731.607] THE MARCH AGAIN.
[ct=1735.364] KIRK: THESE GUYS ARE AS GOOD AS
[ct=1737.853] THERE IS AT RUNNING ROUTES AND
[ct=1739.929] ONCE THE ROUTE IS TAKEN AWAY,
[ct=1741.322] ESPECIALLY ON THIRD DOWN --
[ct=1742.892] WATCH THE RECOGNITION HIS
[ct=1745.040] QUARTERBACK IS IN TROUBLE AND HE
[ct=1746.554] FINDS A SOFT SPOT.
[ct=1748.443] HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE SEEN IT?
[ct=1750.953] IT IS ONE THING TO DRAW THE PLAY
[ct=1754.433] UP BUT MAHOMES AND KELCE DESERVE
[ct=1755.601] SO MUCH CREDIT FOR THOSE OFF
[ct=1755.708] SCHEDULE PLAYS.
[ct=1757.871] AL: PACHECO.
[ct=1763.817] FINALLY WRESTLED DOWN.
[ct=1770.210] -- THAT TURNS WHAT WOULD'VE BEEN

[ct=1782.397] THERE IS NO PANIC.
[ct=1785.023] THERE IS NO WHERE AM I LOOKING.
[ct=1788.445] IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE HE IS JUST
[ct=1790.092] OUT OF THE PRACTICE FIELD AND
[ct=1791.475] HIM AND MY HOMES ARE OUT THERE
[ct=1792.819] MID JULY WORKING ON ROUTES.

[ct=1887.603] KIRK: THEY ARE MOVING HIM MORE
[ct=1887.986] THIS YEAR THAN ANY YEAR IN THE
[ct=1888.370] PAST.
[ct=1890.100] THEY MOVED HIM IN THE PAST BUT
[ct=1891.076] THEY ARE MOVING HIM AROUND A
[ct=1891.392] LITTLE MORE.
[ct=1895.137] TO TRY TO CREATE SOME MATCHUPS.
[ct=1896.253] THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY A
[ct=1898.579] DESIGNED ROUTE LIKE ON A ROUTE

[ct=2019.193] DOING WITH THE SNAKE.
[ct=2020.687] DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN THEY

[ct=2234.689] KIRK: THE BIGGEST CONCERN VANCE
[ct=2237.509] JOSEPH HAS HAD TONIGHT IS HIS
[ct=2239.274] LINEBACKERS ARE GOOD AGAINST A
[ct=2240.621] RUN BUT THERE IS A LOT OF SPACE
[ct=2242.774] AND AN AREA YOU KNOW ANDY REID
[ct=2246.212] AND PATRICK MAHOMES WANT TO
[ct=2248.640] ATTACK IS IN FRONT OF THE
[ct=2249.512] SAFETIES AND BETWEEN THE
[ct=2249.512] LINEBACKERS.
[ct=2251.760] FINDING THE SOFT SPOT.

[ct=2286.430] IT MOTIVATED THEM TO A SUPER
[ct=2286.913] BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP.
[ct=2290.550] MAHOMES IS CONFIDENT HIS GROUP
[ct=2290.933] WILL GET IT.
[ct=2293.487] AL: A LITTLE FLIP HERE, PACHECO.
[ct=2296.130] HE TAKES IT INSIDE THE 30 YARD

[ct=2318.694] AS YOU CAN.
[ct=2320.804] PACHECO HAS ROOM TO WORK AND
[ct=2321.986] GETS DOWNHILL.
[ct=2326.976] VERY GIFTED AND TOUGH TO

[ct=2352.336] THAT IS HOW YOU STOP IT.

[ct=2359.901] THEY SAID LET'S PUT 21 87.
[ct=2361.601] BETTER COVERAGE BUT A GOOD JOB
[ct=2363.314] OF RUNNING AWAY FROM IT.

[ct=2390.832] QUICKLY.
[ct=2394.682] LAST TIME THEY WERE DOWN IN THIS

[ct=2399.590] ZONE AND JUST THE THREE POINTS,

[ct=2408.350] TRAVIS KELCE TO THE RIGHT.
[ct=2412.438] AL: SECOND DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=2420.419] FINDING SOME ROOM.
[ct=2425.334] PACHECO ANGRY AT THE GROUND.

[ct=3331.528] KIRK: SEE MAHOMES TALKING TO THE
[ct=3332.289] SECONDARY FROM DENVER.
[ct=3333.239] I DON'T THINK HE APPRECIATED

[ct=3363.092] DIRECTION.

[ct=3775.064] THE RED ZONE.
[ct=3778.336] NOT GIVING UP A TON OF POINTS TO
[ct=3778.848] ONE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=3781.304] CAME UP WITH A PICK AND FORCED A
[ct=3781.694] FIELD GOAL.
[ct=3783.879] ONE OF FOUR SO FAR FOR KANSAS

[ct=3811.835] KIRK: ALL ONE MOTION.
[ct=3814.455] LOOKED LIKE IT WAS IN BOUNDS
[ct=3816.894] WHEN HE INITIALLY HAD CONTACT I
[ct=3817.737] THINK IT WAS A FOLLOW-THROUGH
[ct=3818.217] THROUGH THE AIR.
[ct=3820.743] THAT IS AN EXTENSION OF THE RUN
[ct=3824.750] GAME, PUTTING PACHECO OUT, THREE
[ct=3825.234] RECEIVERS IN FRONT OF HIM.
[ct=3827.939] AL: LOOKED A BIT LIKE THE WWE.

[ct=3897.884] KIRK: AND I REALLY THINK AS MUCH
[ct=3900.229] AS MAHOMES AND KELCE GET THE
[ct=3902.091] ATTENTION, I THINK THE
[ct=3903.947] DIFFERENCE AS THIS SEASON GOES
[ct=3905.836] ON WILL POTENTIALLY BE THIS
[ct=3906.638] KANSAS CITY DEFENSE.
[ct=3908.990] WE CAN TALK ALL WE WANT ABOUT

[ct=3916.638] ENVIRONMENT AGAINST A DEFENSE
[ct=3917.051] FEELING GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES.
[ct=3919.486] MANY OF THESE GUYS IN THEIR
[ct=3920.015] SECOND YEAR.
[ct=3922.596] WE KNOW ALL ABOUT WHAT CHRIS
[ct=3924.104] JONES CAN DO, BEEN AROUND EIGHT
[ct=3925.706] YEARS.
[ct=3929.497] THEY HAVE A GROUP THAT IS FAST,
[ct=3932.207] DIALED IN AND PLAYING WITH

[ct=3943.762] AL: RUSSELL WILSON HANDS THE
[ct=3944.643] BALL OFF HERE.
[ct=3950.393] UNDRAFTED ROOKIE MCLAUGHLIN.
[ct=3953.382] KIRK: IT FEELS LIKE A LOT MORE
[ct=3955.732] BUT IT IS STILL A TWO POSSESSION
[ct=3956.186] GAME TECHNICALLY.
[ct=3957.564] YOU CAN SEE THE HALFTIME
[ct=3959.470] ADJUSTMENTS TO GET THINGS GOING
[ct=3959.835] IN THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=3962.037] A PROBLEM SPOT FOR THEM HAS BEEN
[ct=3962.876] THE THIRD QUARTER.
[ct=3965.466] HE TOLD US THIS WEEK, I HAVE
[ct=3966.503] BEEN STRIPPED OUT OF A FEW PLAYS
[ct=3967.896] TO START THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=3969.508] I WOULD GO BACK TO THE RUNNING
[ct=3971.948] THE SCREEN WORKED FOR HIM AT THE
[ct=3972.473] END OF THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=3974.749] THEY AVERAGED OVER SIX YARDS A

[ct=3985.082] AL: DOWN THE LEFT SIDELINE.
[ct=3988.405] FLIGHT IS THROWN.
[ct=3990.127] WATSON MAKING CONTACT WITH
[ct=3993.511] THAT WILL TAKE THE BALL TO
[ct=3993.511] MIDFIELD.
[ct=3996.327] KIRK: LOOKED LIKE HE GRABBED
[ct=3996.871] ONTO THAT ARM.
[ct=4001.544] REFEREE: PASS
[ct=4001.986] INTERFERENCE.
[ct=4004.372] AUTOMATIC FIRST.
[ct=4007.567] KIRK: YOU LOSE THE FOOTBALL IN
[ct=4009.106] THE AIR AND THE RECEIVER WILL
[ct=4009.521] WORK HIS WAY BACK TO THE
[ct=4011.860] FOOTBALL AND YOU ARE IN NO MAN'S
[ct=4011.860] LAND.

[ct=4019.165] INTERFERENCE, MOVE THE BALL TO
[ct=4019.334] THE 46 YARD LINE.

[ct=4042.629] SECOND AND NINE.
[ct=4045.755] KIRK: ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I
[ct=4046.817] THINK THIS FRONT DOES IS THEIR
[ct=4049.252] ABILITY TO GET OFF THE BLOCKS
[ct=4051.235] AGAINST THE RUN.
[ct=4057.491] TALKING ABOUT JONES, HOW ABOUT
[ct=4058.525] THE IMPROVEMENT?
[ct=4060.559] HE SAID MAKE SURE YOU TALK ABOUT
[ct=4062.969] 51, THIS GUY HAS BEEN THE UNSUNG
[ct=4064.742] HERO ON THIS DEFENSIVE FRONT.

[ct=4086.674] WORK WITH.
[ct=4089.672] HAS SOME POWER, SURPRISING POWER

[ct=4134.717] THEY HAVE BEEN THROWING THE
[ct=4137.074] FOOTBALL ON, NO ONE HAS BEEN
[ct=4138.849] OPEN ON THESE THIRD AND SHORTS.
[ct=4142.588] GOOD TIGHT COVERAGE.

[ct=4143.227] OFFENSIVE LINE.

[ct=4340.486] THEY HAVE BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB
[ct=4342.451] WITH SAFETIES BACK, TAKING AWAY
[ct=4342.811] THINGS FOR THE MOST PART.
[ct=4345.366] HE'S GOT THE UNDERNEATH THROW TO
[ct=4346.808] HIS RIGHT BUT INSTEAD OF
[ct=4349.243] THROWING TO MCKINNON, USES HIM

[ct=4465.198] HE WANTED TO KEEP IT SO BADLY
[ct=4466.886] THAT HE FORGOT TO READ IT
[ct=4466.886] PROPERLY.

[ct=4758.960] ALL EIGHT RECEPTIONS AGAINST
[ct=4761.291] WE TALK ABOUT THOSE TRAVIS
[ct=4763.758] ROUTES, WHEN HE FEELS LEVERAGED,
[ct=4767.416] SOFT SPOT, HE AND PATRICK
[ct=4767.936] MAHOMES HAVE SUCH GREAT
[ct=4768.305] CHEMISTRY.
[ct=4769.915] THAT HAS BEEN ON DISPLAY
[ct=4775.504] AL: SO SECOND DOWN AND 10.
[ct=4779.519] SCOREBOARD TELLING EVERYBODY TO
[ct=4779.581] GET LOUDER.
[ct=4782.413] AND THEY COMPLY.
[ct=4793.208] KIRK: YOU SEE BOLTON WALKED UP
[ct=4795.737] THAT IS WHY HE'S ADJUSTING
[ct=4796.255] THINGS.
[ct=4798.802] LOOKS LIKE BOLTON BACKING OUT.
[ct=4801.334] TRANQUILL COMING.
[ct=4804.204] AL: KNOCKED DOWN AGAIN.
[ct=4804.204] THEY DO IT AGAIN.
[ct=4806.364] ANOTHER BATTED PASS.
[ct=4808.804] TALKED ABOUT IT A COUPLE TIMES
[ct=4810.008] THAT IS FOUR.
[ct=4814.605] KIRK: THEY ARE MOVING, SHOOT
[ct=4817.185] THIS WAY WITH JONES, WAS SO
[ct=4819.174] QUICK OFF THE BALL.
[ct=4821.515] THAT EMPHASIS AGAINST A SHORTER
[ct=4823.713] RUSSELL WILSON IS KNOCK THOSE
[ct=4825.649] BALL DOWN -- THOSE BALLS DOWN,
[ct=4827.867] THOSE QUICK THROWS.
[ct=4831.278] GOING DEEP AND OFF THE
[ct=4833.850] FINGERTIPS THAT TIME OF BRANDON
[ct=4833.850] JOHNSON.
[ct=4840.464] FIRST TIME THEY THROUGH
[ct=4843.719] JOHNSON'S WAY TONIGHT, A GUY WHO
[ct=4844.643] HAS THREE TOUCHDOWN RECEPTIONS
[ct=4845.281] THIS SEASON.
[ct=4847.176] KIRK: TRYING TO GET A LITTLE
[ct=4848.458] SEPARATION AT THE LINE OF
[ct=4850.227] TIGHT COVERAGE BY WATSON.
[ct=4853.491] THE BEST THING HE DOES IS READ
[ct=4855.790] THE EYES AND ANTICIPATES THE
[ct=4857.771] BALL AND NOT GET AWAY.
[ct=4861.283] -- AND KNOCKS IT AWAY.
[ct=4863.104] AL: RILEY DIXON.
[ct=4863.874] 22.
[ct=4866.982] WASHINGTON HAULS IT IN.
[ct=4872.631] THERE IS ROOM.
[ct=4874.083] GOOD RUN BACK.
[ct=4876.017] EVERYTHING IS IMPENDING THE
[ct=4876.367] INFRACTION.
[ct=4889.823] THAT WAS A 51 YARD TO 21 YARD
[ct=4890.297] RUN BACK.
[ct=4893.242] REFEREE: HOLDING BY THE KICKING
[ct=4895.090] TEAM, NUMBER 44.
[ct=4897.200] THIS 10 YARD PENALTY WILL BE
[ct=4901.708] ADMEANWHILE, WHILE YOU WERE GONE
[ct=4903.507] I SAID HOW UNUSUAL IT WAS TO
[ct=4905.381] HAVE THE RECEIVING TEAM CALLED
[ct=4905.760] FOR THE PENALTY.
[ct=4910.943] IT WAS THE RECEIVING TEAM, NOT
[ct=4911.515] THE KICKING TEAM.
[ct=4913.613] SO INSTEAD OF THE BALL BEING AT
[ct=4915.027] MIDFIELD, WHEN WE LEFT YOU FOR
[ct=4916.555] THE BREAK AT THE END OF THE LEFT
[ct=4918.822] SEGMENT, THE BALL IS MOVED BACK.
[ct=4920.435] YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
[ct=4921.644] KIRK: WE GOT YOU.
[ct=4922.898] I WAS WITH YOU.
[ct=4925.560] I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT CALL VERY
[ct=4926.009] OFTEN.
[ct=4929.655] AL: I GOT MY PROMO CARDS FLYING
[ct=4930.419] AROUND IN THE WIND, BUT APART
[ct=4930.860] FROM THAT.
[ct=4932.177] HERE WE GO.
[ct=4934.847] SECOND AND SEVEN.
[ct=4940.283] SCREEN.
[ct=4946.467] NICE TACKLE MADE BY SINGLETON.
[ct=4948.307] WE CAN TELL YOU AMAZON MUSIC
[ct=4951.844] LIVE, BACK MIDNIGHT EASTERN TIME
[ct=4954.727] WITH METRO BOOMING AND OUR MAN
[ct=4958.302] HOSTING 2CHAINZ.
[ct=4961.490] WHEN THE GAME ENDS, LIVE MUSIC
[ct=4961.490] BEGINS.
[ct=4964.391] METRO BOOMING, LADIES AND
[ct=4964.770] GENTLEMEN.
[ct=4969.911] AL: I FLY OUT.
[ct=4971.752] YOU STICK AROUND FOR THAT SHOW.
[ct=4975.384] KIRK: DAMN RIGHT.
[ct=4977.575] AL: BALL IS AT THE 24.
[ct=4981.962] AVOIDS THE FIRST DOWN BUT NOT
[ct=4982.478] THE SECOND.
[ct=4985.304] PERKINS WAS THERE TO SLOW HIM
[ct=4988.623] TACKLE MADE, BACK OF THE LINE.
[ct=4990.289] SECOND DOWN AND 11.
[ct=4992.724] KIRK: IT HAS BEEN A LONG NIGHT
[ct=4995.307] FOR RUSS WILSON AND SEAN PAYTON,
[ct=4996.388] BUT THIS DEFENSE ARE PLAYING THE
[ct=4997.056] DEFENDING SUPER BOWL CHAMPS, YOU
[ct=4999.593] HELD 1-5 IN THE RED ZONE,
[ct=5001.823] CREATED THE TURNOVER, YOU HAVE
[ct=5002.522] DONE JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU
[ct=5005.307] CAN TO KEEP YOUR TEAM IN THIS
[ct=5005.931] GAME TO GIVE THEM A SHOT.
[ct=5007.827] IT HAS NOT BEEN A GREAT YEAR FOR
[ct=5008.140] THIS DEFENSE.
[ct=5010.697] TONIGHT THEY HAVE STEPPED UP.
[ct=5012.752] SOMEONE WILL HAVE TO MAKE A PLAY
[ct=5015.363] ONE MORE TIME ON THIS SIDE OF
[ct=5016.652] THE BALL.
[ct=5019.720] AL: SECOND AND 11.
[ct=5020.893] GOING DEEP.
[ct=5024.639] OFF THE FINGERTIPS THAT TIME OF
[ct=5025.708] JUSTIN WATSON.
[ct=5030.608] OUT IN FRONT OF MATHIS, COULD
[ct=5031.739] NOT HOLD.
[ct=5032.247] AND HE IS HURT.
[ct=5034.090] REFEREE: TIMEOUT FOR INJURY.
[ct=5038.136] KIRK: RUNS A GREAT ROUTE.
[ct=5041.224] A LITTLE OUT AND UP AGAINST
[ct=5044.663] MATHIS, WHO THEY HAVE BEEN
[ct=5045.450] TRYING TO GO AFTER.
[ct=5046.807] HE DOES A GOOD JOB OF OLAN AWAY
[ct=5047.241] FROM HIM.
[ct=5050.731] THE BALL IS PERFECTLY THROWN AND
[ct=5051.091] HE'S UNABLE TO COME DOWN WITH
[ct=5054.262] THAT IS A HUGE GAIN.
[ct=5056.580] ALL OF HIS WEIGHT COMES DOWN ON
[ct=5057.681] IT LOOKS LIKE THAT RIGHT ARM.
[ct=5060.481] THIRD AND 11.
[ct=5063.065] WATSON WAS ABLE TO WALK OFF
[ct=5065.711] UNDER HIS OWN POWER AFTER THAT
[ct=5065.711] INJURY TIMEOUT.
[ct=5067.414] HERE IS MCKINNON.
[ct=5070.754] MCKINNON ABLE TO SLIDE THROUGH,
[ct=5071.391] PICKED UP FOR FIRST.
[ct=5073.083] LEG IS STRONG.
[ct=5079.437] AND MCKINNON FOR THE MOMENT WILL
[ct=5079.437] TAKE IT TO THE 10 YARD LINE.
[ct=5082.736] THERE IS A FLAG ALL THE WAY
[ct=5087.644] KIRK: THIS IS GOING TO COME ALL
[ct=5089.536] THE WAY BACK AROUND THE 32 YARD
[ct=5095.651] AL: FORGET ABOUT ALL THAT, IT
[ct=5098.621] WAS THIRD AND 11.
[ct=5104.513] KIRK: THEY HAVE BEEN HITTING
[ct=5105.265] SOME SCREENS.
[ct=5108.406] THAT ONE HIT BIG, BUT IT WILL
[ct=5108.406] HAVE TO COME BACK.
[ct=5110.331] HERE IS THE PUSH IN THE BACK.
[ct=5114.077] MCMILLAN TRYING TO GET TO THE
[ct=5117.056] THERE IS THE BLOCK RIGHT THERE.
[ct=5124.797] REFEREE: RULING ON THE FIELD IS
[ct=5125.169] THAT THE RUNNER STEPPED OUT OF
[ct=5126.874] BOUNDS AT THE 35 YARD LINE.
[ct=5130.055] DURING THE PLAY, PERSONAL FOUL,
[ct=5131.521] BLIND SIDE BLOCK, OFFENSE NUMBER
[ct=5132.225] 29.
[ct=5135.789] THE PENALTY WILL BE HALF THE
[ct=5136.812] DISTANCE FROM THE GOAL.
[ct=5140.735] CORRECTION, IT IS A 15 YARD
[ct=5140.735] PENALTY.
[ct=5143.534] AL: AFTER ALL THAT HE STEPS OUT
[ct=5144.505] OF BOUNDS ON TOP OF IT.
[ct=5147.507] REFEREE: CORRECTION, BLIND SIDE
[ct=5147.858] BLOCK WAS NUMBER 11.
[ct=5149.375] IT IS THIRD DOWN.
[ct=5152.055] AL: WE HAVE HAD A FEW
[ct=5152.463] CORRECTIONS ALREADY.
[ct=5155.137] THAT WAS THE BLIND SIDE BLOCK WE
[ct=5155.137] TALKED ABOUT.
[ct=5157.037] ON TOP OF THAT HE STEPS OUT OF
[ct=5157.435] BOUNDS.
[ct=5161.491] THE REST OF IT ALL FOR NAUGHT.
[ct=5163.349] YOU GET A BUNCH OF NOTHING AND
[ct=5164.382] NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU HAVE
[ct=5164.821] THIRD AND 26.
[ct=5178.440] I LOVE IT WHEN THE CROWD BOOS,
[ct=5179.199] YOU CAN SEE IT ON THE BIG SCREEN
[ct=5189.542] CAN DO NO WRONG.
[ct=5193.368] THIRD AND SEVEN.
[ct=5195.605] THIRD AND 17.
[ct=5198.117] NOT 26.
[ct=5202.874] YOU HAVE A LITTLE PASS LOW,
[ct=5203.247] SCOOPED UP.
[ct=5206.691] A LITTLE SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN
[ct=5210.151] WAS RICE, THE ROOKIE WHO SCORED
[ct=5210.533] BEFORE.
[ct=5216.279] GOT IT TO THE END ZONE.
[ct=5219.954] CROWD STILL BOOIN
[ct=5224.190] KIRK: YOU GET A GLIMPSE OF WHAT
[ct=5225.364] RICE CAN DO AFTER THE CATCH.
[ct=5227.802] THE EXHILARATION, I THOUGHT
[ct=5231.389] MAYBE -- THE ACCELERATION, I
[ct=5232.192] THOUGHT MAYBE PACHECO WAS UP
[ct=5233.181] THERE.
[ct=5236.391] GIVING CHIEFS FANS A GLIMPSE OF
[ct=5236.800] WHAT IS TO COME LATER IN THE
[ct=5237.966] YEAR FOR THIS ROOKIE.
[ct=5239.482] AL: TOMMY TOWNSEND.
[ct=5244.789] WOBBLY KICK, SHORT.
[ct=5252.119] TAKES IT TO THE 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=5254.375] KIRK: EVERYONE WILL LOOK AT
[ct=5256.173] RUSSELL WILSON AND TALK ABOUT
[ct=5258.118] WHAT IS GOING ON, PUTTING UP BIG
[ct=5258.925] YARDS THROUGH THE AIR.
[ct=5261.372] YOU WATCH THE FILM, YOU WILL SEE
[ct=5262.747] IT HAS BEEN TIGHT COVERAGE WITH
[ct=5264.568] SNEED AND COMPANY DOWNFIELD.
[ct=5266.701] TRENT MCDUFFIE DOING A GOOD JOB.
[ct=5268.797] SPAGS PUTS THESE GUYS ON ISLAND.
[ct=5272.287] JOSHUA WILLIAMS IS HELD UP WHEN
[ct=5273.966] HE'S HAD HIS CHANCES IN HIS
[ct=5275.434] JAYLEN WATSON.
[ct=5277.136] GREAT JOB ON THE BACK END.
[ct=5280.014] I THINK THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
[ct=5280.377] IN THIS DEFENSE.
[ct=5283.328] WILLIAMS IN HIS SECOND YEAR,
[ct=5285.454] WATSON IN HIS SECOND, COOK SIX,
[ct=5288.313] REID COMING OVER FROM HOUSTON
[ct=5290.617] LAST YEAR, MCDUFFIE IN HIS
[ct=5291.978] SECOND YEAR, FIRST ROUND HER OUT
[ct=5292.814] OF WASHINGTON.
[ct=5296.453] ALL OF THESE GUYS LOCKED IN AND
[ct=5297.431] NOT THINKING ABOUT SCHEME
[ct=5297.867] ANYMORE.
[ct=5300.832] AL: WILSON HAS BEEN LIMITED TO
[ct=5303.422] 57 YARDS ON 17 ATTEMPTS TONIGHT.
[ct=5307.254] GOING DEEP, FINALLY IS ABLE TO
[ct=5310.364] CONNECT ON A DEEP THROW TO
[ct=5315.021] WE HAD 57 YARDS BEFORE THAT AND
[ct=5315.984] PICKS UP 23 THERE.
[ct=5320.039] KIRK: YOU HAD TWO DEFENDERS IN
[ct=5320.039] THE LEFT FLAT.
[ct=5323.067] YOU HAVE WILLIAMS, ALSO A
[ct=5324.899] LINEBACKER, GAY, TWO GUYS IN THE
[ct=5327.003] BACKGROUND UP ON TIGHT
[ct=5329.825] UNDERNEATH COVERAGE, ONE OF THE
[ct=5330.218] FEW MISTAKES WE HAVE SEEN FROM
[ct=5330.714] KANSAS CITY.
[ct=5332.920] IT OPENED UP AN EASY THROWING
[ct=5334.528] WINDOW ON TOP OF THAT COVERAGE
[ct=5334.545] TO SUDDEN.
[ct=5336.753] -- TO SUTTON.
[ct=5341.192] AL: WILLIAMS FOR SIX.
[ct=5349.298] 8:40 LEFT IN THE FOURTH.
[ct=5352.423] KIRK: IT IS NICE TO SEE RUSSELL
[ct=5355.077] WILSON STRETCH THIS DEFENSE AND
[ct=5355.258] FINALLY HAVE AN OPEN RECEIVER.
[ct=5358.612] I REALLY THOUGHT COMING INTO THE
[ct=5361.313] NIGHT, THE WAY RUSSELL WILSON
[ct=5361.761] HAS BEEN PLAYING THIS SEAN
[ct=5364.574] PAYTON OFFENSE, HIS GREATEST
[ct=5365.123] STRENGTH IS THAT VERTICAL SHOT,
[ct=5367.306] THOSE GO BALLS OUTSIDE THE
[ct=5367.306] NUMBERS.
[ct=5370.773] KANSAS CITY IS COMPLETELY TAKING
[ct=5371.113] THAT AWAY TONIGHT.
[ct=5374.775] AL: SECOND DOWN FIVE.
[ct=5376.365] CHASED BY JONES.
[ct=5379.200] OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=5382.679] TAKES A SHOT AT THE VERY END
[ct=5383.464] FROM JUSTIN REID.
[ct=5387.127] BUT LEGAL.
[ct=5389.940] KIRK: GREAT JOB AGAIN.
[ct=5391.726] HE LOOKS LIKE HE HAS A CHANCE.
[ct=5394.643] CHRIS JONES IS GOING TO GET
[ct=5395.139] RIGHT INTO HIS FACE.
[ct=5397.183] HE'S ABLE TO SHAKE HIM.
[ct=5398.417] EYES DOWNFIELD.
[ct=5401.700] CHANEL FOLLOWS THE RUNNING BACK.
[ct=5404.129] THIS IS WHAT HE HAS DONE A LOT
[ct=5404.842] OF THIS YEAR.
[ct=5408.466] THAT BEING A LATE HIT COME OUT
[ct=5411.627] OF BOUNDS BY REID BUT A NO CALL.
[ct=5419.594] AL: WILLIAMS THE RUNNING BACK.
[ct=5423.904] WILLIAMS GOES INTO THE WAITING
[ct=5426.086] ARMS OF ONE CHRIS JONES.
[ct=5430.169] KIRK: BIG FELLA, HANDS, HAS
[ct=5430.770] GREAT LENGTH.
[ct=5433.459] WE ALWAYS GET EXCITED TO WATCH.
[ct=5434.610] WHERE IS HE GOING TO BOUNCE
[ct=5435.899] AROUND?
[ct=5437.786] HE IS A PASS RUSHER.
[ct=5439.047] HOW QUICK IS HE?
[ct=5442.930] HE IS A DEFENSIVE TACKLE AT 6'6"
[ct=5447.198] AND HE'S ABLE TO OLE GUARDS.
[ct=5449.680] IT IS NOT JUST THAT BURST OFF
[ct=5450.047] THE LINE.
[ct=5452.769] I LOVE LISTENING TO HIM AS A
[ct=5453.349] VETERAN TALKING ABOUT HAND
[ct=5455.877] PLACEMENT, READING GUARDS, AND
[ct=5456.772] HOW MUCH PRESSURE THEY HAVE ON
[ct=5457.411] THEIR HANDS.
[ct=5460.076] AL: WILSON ON THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=5464.222] TO THE 22 YARD LINE GOES
[ct=5465.484] MCGLOCKLIN -- GOES MCLAUGHLIN.
[ct=5467.928] JONES IS A BIT OF A GOURMET.
[ct=5469.965] WE MET A FEW YEARS AGO.
[ct=5472.855] A GOURMET MEAL AT HIM WAS LIKE
[ct=5476.307] MOTHER CLUCKERS.
[ct=5479.373] KIRK: FIRST THING YOU WANTED TO
[ct=5480.132] KNOW IS WHERE IS THE BEST
[ct=5480.507] STEAKHOUSE?
[ct=5482.517] HE HAS A HIGH BAR.
[ct=5483.614] AL: YES HE DOES.
[ct=5486.838] KIRK: THAT PLACE IS OK.
[ct=5490.941] VERY ARTICULATE.
[ct=5491.966] AL: NICE GUY.
[ct=5494.616] THIRD DOWN AND FIVE.
[ct=5498.390] EVERYBODY COMING.
[ct=5499.854] JAILBREAK.
[ct=5500.984] PASS THROWN.
[ct=5502.831] A LITTLE UNDERTHROWN.
[ct=5504.514] JEUDY IS THERE.
[ct=5506.550] COVERING ON THE PLAY IS
[ct=5506.885] MCDUFFIE.
[ct=5508.651] FLAG IS DOWN.
[ct=5510.919] MIKE EDWARDS CAME IN FROM THE
[ct=5511.667] SAFETY SPOT TO PUT THE HEAT ON.
[ct=5513.720] THEY SENT EVERYBODY ON THAT ONE.
[ct=5516.717] REFEREE: ROUGHING THE PASSER,
[ct=5517.451] DEFENSE NUMBER 21.
[ct=5521.737] IT IS FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5524.214] AL: IT WAS EDWARDS.
[ct=5526.599] KIRK: THEY BROUGHT BOLTON.
[ct=5528.515] THEY GET PRETTY EXOTIC.
[ct=5530.018] HE'S ABLE TO SHOOT THROUGH THE
[ct=5530.018] GAP.
[ct=5535.166] IT IS NOT TO HIT, BUT IS IT TO
[ct=5536.117] FOLLOW THROUGH?
[ct=5537.742] IS THAT THE CALL?
[ct=5541.955] TERRY: LOOKS LIKE AT THE END HE
[ct=5542.352] MIGHT LAND WITH ALL HIS BODY
[ct=5543.741] WEIGHT QUARTERBACK.
[ct=5545.018] IT'S RIGHT ON THE EDGE.
[ct=5547.287] THEY ARE GENERALLY GOING TO CALL
[ct=5547.287] THAT.
[ct=5549.953] HE NEEDS TO BRACE HIMSELF OR GET
[ct=5550.554] TO THE SIDE.
[ct=5553.730] AL: YOU SAW ANDY, RIGHT ON THE
[ct=5554.995] EDGE.
[ct=5556.604] THAT WAS THE RIGHT RESPONSE
[ct=5560.990] PERINE IS THE BACK.
[ct=5566.071] CAN'T GET A FIRST DOWN WITHOUT A
[ct=5568.283] FROM THE 11.
[ct=5572.724] IN THE CORNER OF THE END ZONE.
[ct=5575.909] COURTLAND SUTTON LOOKING AROUND,
[ct=5577.985] SAYING, HEY, WAIT A SECOND.
[ct=5585.703] TERRY: IT WAS GOING TO COME DOWN
[ct=5586.060] TO THE NEAR FOOT.
[ct=5587.973] WATCH HIS RIGHT FOOT AND SEE IF
[ct=5588.445] HE HAS POSSESSION.
[ct=5589.860] HE STILL HAS POSSESSION.
[ct=5591.342] LEFT FOOT DOWN.
[ct=5593.021] DOES HE BOBBLE THE BALL?
[ct=5594.843] LOOKED LIKE HE POSSESSED THAT.
[ct=5597.018] THAT LOOKS LIKE A TOUCHDOWN TO
[ct=5597.018] ME.
[ct=5598.887] TERRY: IT IS.
[ct=5601.018] IT IS THE KNEE THAT COMES DOWN.
[ct=5603.322] HE GETS CONTROL THERE, THEN THE
[ct=5606.547] KNEE COMES DOWN IN BOUNDS AND HE
[ct=5606.547] MAINS CONTROL.
[ct=5608.253] THIS IS A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=5610.368] AL: YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CHALLENGE
[ct=5611.468] OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE TH
[ct=5614.346] REFEREE: DENVER IS CHALLENGING
[ct=5615.632] THE RULE ON THE FIELD OF AN
[ct=5616.250] INCOMPLETE PASS.
[ct=5617.544] AL: SOME PLAY.
[ct=5619.879] WELL, WELL, WELL.
[ct=5623.135] SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE COME
[ct=5626.490] A TWO POITHEY HAVE USED ONE CHAL
[ct=5629.666] AL: THE TOUCHDOWN ESSENTIALLY
[ct=5630.728] THE WAY WE SAW IT IS CALLED.
[ct=5633.752] WE CAN TELL YOU BEFORE WE WENT
[ct=5634.990] TO BREAK IT WAS A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=5641.137] KIRK: THE BIG THING IS THE BALL
[ct=5641.931] WAS NOT JUGGLING THE FOOTBALL,
[ct=5644.772] HE HAD CLEAR POSSESSION OF IT
[ct=5645.258] WHEN HIS KNEE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=5648.150] AL: A TWO POINT TRY TO MAKE IT
[ct=5649.405] AN EIGHT POINT GAME.
[ct=5653.492] FROM THE TWO.
[ct=5658.477] AND HE GOES FOR THE CONVERSION.
[ct=5667.158] SO AT 6:07, KANSAS CITY SO MANY
[ct=5668.617] OPPORTUNITIES, BUT THE DENVER
[ct=5670.302] DEFENSE ABLE TO HOLD THEM EXCEPT
[ct=5670.841] ONE TIME.
[ct=5674.799] KIRK: THEY GOT A CHANCE.
[ct=5677.348] GREAT BLOCK WORKING DOWN THIS
[ct=5677.348] DOUBLE-TEAMED.
[ct=5679.608] YOU GET A BLOCK HERE, OPENS UP
[ct=5679.858] VERY NICELY.
[ct=5682.673] GOOD JOB BY THE CENTER.
[ct=5684.821] THEY ARE ABLE TO CLIMB BACK TO
[ct=5686.475] THE BACKER WILLIE GAY.
[ct=5688.803] YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF
[ct=5691.601] PASS PLAY YOU COME UP WITH, BUT
[ct=5692.690] THE WAY THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
[ct=5694.117] CONTROL THINGS FOR THE MOST PART
[ct=5696.832] UPFRONT, THIS RUN GAME HAS BEEN
[ct=5697.244] SOMETHING THEY CAN RELY ON.
[ct=5700.371] THAT TIME WITH A LOT ON THE LINE
[ct=5701.372] TO MAKE IT A ONE POSSESSION
[ct=5702.541] GAME, THEY ARE ABLE TO GET A
[ct=5703.237] GOOD PUSH.
[ct=5706.403] AL: THEY RUN THE BALL 23 TIMES,
[ct=5709.435] THAT IS FIVE YARDS PER CARRY.
[ct=5711.355] HERE IS THE ROUGHING THE PASSER.
[ct=5713.420] KIRK: THAT IS THE BIG CALL.
[ct=5717.567] ALWAYS -- ALL HIS WEIGHT COMING
[ct=5718.711] DOWN ON THE QUARTERBACK, ENDED
[ct=5722.008] UP GIVING DENVER MORE OF AN
[ct=5722.008] OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=5725.190] SUTTON WITH THAT GREAT CATCH TO
[ct=5725.719] GET ON THE BOARD.
[ct=5727.345] AL: PENALTY ON EDWARDS.
[ct=5729.519] MAHOMES GOES TO WORK FROM THE

[ct=5734.916] DOCUMENTARY OF ALL TIME IN THE
[ct=5736.588] U.S., KELCE, NOW STREAMING ON

[ct=5743.573] EPIC YEAR OF THEIR LIVES
[ct=5744.656] CULMINATING IN A SUPER BOWL
[ct=5744.656] SHOWDOWN FOR THE AGES.
[ct=5748.218] GREAT GAME WON BY KANSAS CITY
[ct=5748.761] OVER PHILADELPHIA.
[ct=5753.649] AND OF COURSE LOOKING ON IS HIS
[ct=5758.635] -- WELL, AT THE MOMENT, HIS GOOD
[ct=5761.131] BUDDY AND GIRLFRIEND.
[ct=5763.325] TAYLOR SWIFT.
[ct=5764.868] HE MAKES A CATCH.
[ct=5766.411] GAIN OF THREE.
[ct=5772.443] KELCE NOW IS STILL DOWN AND
[ct=5772.897] WILL HOBBLE BACK TO THE
[ct=5776.213] THAT ANKLE WAS INJURED.
[ct=5780.439] IT'S NOT A HIGH ANKLE.
[ct=5781.199] THEY CALL IT A REGULAR LOW ANKLE
[ct=5781.655] SPRAIN.
[ct=5783.569] KIRK: THAT IS THE THING WITH
[ct=5785.414] ANGLES, YOU ARE TRYING TO PUSH
[ct=5786.180] OFF.
[ct=5788.200] SINGLETON TO WRAP UP AROUND THAT
[ct=5788.896] ANKLE.
[ct=5791.600] IT IS PLAYS LIKE THIS WITH THE
[ct=5793.591] SCAR TISSUE THAT IT SETS YOU
[ct=5795.363] BACK, ALWAYS LINGERING.
[ct=5797.660] AL: SECOND AND SEVEN.
[ct=5805.329] BLITZ.
[ct=5808.162] GETS AWAY, AS HE NORMALLY DOES.
[ct=5810.068] MAKES A THROW.
[ct=5812.159] IS BUMPED OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=5814.493] JONATHON COOPER ON THE HELMET.
[ct=5816.382] THIRD AND TWO.
[ct=5820.401] KIRK: THE QUARTERBACK 40 YARDS
[ct=5822.365] DOWNFIELD DOES THE PUMP FAKE.
[ct=5824.414] DEFENSE WILL FALL FOR IT.
[ct=5826.697] KELCE WILL COME BACK OUT ON THE
[ct=5829.353] GOOD TO SEE THAT HE'S FEELING
[ct=5829.353] ALL RIGHT.
[ct=5832.341] GOOD FOR KANSAS CITY CONSIDERING
[ct=5834.995] NINE TIMES OUT OF 10 YOU ARE
[ct=5835.798] LOOKING TO GET HIM THE BALL.
[ct=5840.107] AL: MAHOMES HAS THROWN NINE
[ct=5841.952] TIMES, COMPLETED EVERY ONE OF
[ct=5842.309] THEM.
[ct=5847.405] THROWS.
[ct=5852.277] RICE TO THE 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=5858.402] JACKSON IS THERE SAVING THE TD.
[ct=5859.588] 28 YARDS.
[ct=5862.280] KIRK: WATCH HIM AFFECT
[ct=5864.310] SINGLETON, USING HIS EYES TO
[ct=5865.596] MOVE HIM TOWARDS KELCE.
[ct=5868.002] THEY ARE GOING TO KELCE A LOT
[ct=5871.854] AND HE MOVES 49 AND IT OPENS UP
[ct=5873.546] A NICE PASSING LANE TO GET THE
[ct=5874.288] BALL BACK TO RICE.
[ct=5879.645] AL: GOT THE EYES GOING, THE
[ct=5880.985] TONGUE GOING, THE WHOLE THING.
[ct=5883.612] LOVE THE WAY HE SURVEYS.

[ct=5895.929] THREADS HIS WAY TO THE 35 YARD
[ct=5901.020] SECOND AND SIX, CHEWING UP A BIT
[ct=5901.020] OF TIME AS WELL.
[ct=5907.847] EACH TEAM HAS USED ALL OF ITS
[ct=5908.418] TIMEOUTS.
[ct=5916.193] PACHECO OUT.
[ct=5919.599] KIRK: HE CAN'T GET HIS HELMET
[ct=5920.186] SITUATED.
[ct=5924.379] AL: EDWARDS-HELAIRE COMES IN.
[ct=5926.315] STILL PLENTY OF TIME.
[ct=5929.712] PLAY CLOCK AT --
[ct=5935.291] 24 YARD LINE.
[ct=5939.921] TACKLE MADE, MOORE MAKING THE
[ct=5939.921] GRAB.
[ct=5942.009] MATHIS MAKES THE STOP.
[ct=5944.512] KIRK: LOOK AT OUR NEXT GEN STATS
[ct=5947.032] POWERED BY AWS WITH MY HOLMES
[ct=5948.377] THROWING THE FOOTBALL -- WITH
[ct=5950.458] MAHOMES THROWING THE FOOTBALL 10
[ct=5953.014] 87 YARDS UNDER 10.
[ct=5956.020] A LOT OF THEM TONIGHT AGAINST
[ct=5958.423] HE'S HAD TO GO UNDERNEATH.
[ct=5959.874] THAT HAS BEEN A THEME FOR HIM.
[ct=5962.160] NEED TO BE PATIENT.
[ct=5965.340] THIS DENVER DEFENSE HAS PROVEN
[ct=5967.569] TO BE A HANDFUL FOR KANSAS CITY,
[ct=5968.620] ESPECIALLY FINISHING OFF DRIVES.
[ct=5970.045] THEY JUST CAN'T PUT IT IN THE
[ct=5970.432] END ZONE.
[ct=5972.638] AL: DENVER TAKES A TIMEOUT TO
[ct=5974.533] STOP THAT CLOCK, 3:04.
[ct=5977.516] THEY HAVE TWO PLUS THE
[ct=5977.516] TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=5980.215] KANSAS CITY CLEARLY IN FIELD
[ct=5980.815] GOAL RANGE RIGHT NOW.
[ct=5985.184] MAHOMES HAS NOW THROWN FOR 305
[ct=5987.245] WE STARTED TO SAY BEFORE, WITH
[ct=5990.045] MAHOMES, UNLESS HE HAS A PERFECT
[ct=5991.589] PASSER RATING, HE IS OK.
[ct=5993.902] ANYTHING BUT PERFECT TONIGHT.
[ct=5996.015] KIRK: HAD TO BATTLE TONIGHT.
[ct=5999.547] AL: 29-35.
[ct=6001.153] 305.
[ct=6005.232] RUNS THE BALL FOR 33 YARDS
[ct=6005.683] AS WELL.
[ct=6012.624] NICE TACKLE COMING UP, SIMMONS.
[ct=6015.100] TIMEOUT TAKEN BY DENVER.
[ct=6016.400] 2:58.
[ct=6019.111] KIRK: GREAT TO SEE JUSTIN
[ct=6019.715] SIMMONS BACK IN THIS LINEUP.
[ct=6021.490] WAS BACK LAST WEEK.
[ct=6023.359] THIS IS WHAT HE'S REALLY KNOWN
[ct=6025.222] FOR, HIS RANGE IN THE PAST GAME.
[ct=6029.026] WITH THE EXPERIENCE HE HAS, HOW
[ct=6030.116] QUICKLY HE'S BEEN ABLE TO
[ct=6030.641] RECOGNIZE THINGS AND GET
[ct=6032.557] INVOLVED IN RUN SUPPORT, EAT
[ct=6033.816] YOUR OUT OF BOSTON COLLEGE.
[ct=6035.431] TAKES AWAY THAT SPACE.
[ct=6038.269] -- EIGHT YEAR OUT OF BOSTON
[ct=6038.906] COLLEGE.
[ct=6042.315] NO CHANCE TO GET THAT STARTED.
[ct=6043.982] AL: SECOND DOWN AND 11.
[ct=6047.228] KIRK: KANSAS CITY, ALL THEY NEED
[ct=6047.228] IS A FIELD GOAL.
[ct=6049.505] THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT EATING
[ct=6050.884] UP CLOCK AND TRYING TO MAKE THIS
[ct=6052.861] A TWO POSSESSION GAME.
[ct=6067.663] AL: A LITTLE FLIP HERE.
[ct=6074.534] TONEY, HE GETS DUMPED AT THE 24.
[ct=6079.345] THEY HAVE THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING
[ct=6079.345] AND ONE TIMEOUT.
[ct=6082.261] THEY ARE GOING TO SAVE THAT.
[ct=6084.720] RIGHT HERE.
[ct=6086.101] AND OF COURSE, KANSAS CITY WILL
[ct=6089.886] LET THE CLOCK RUN DOWN AS CLOSE
[ct=6094.736] AS THEY CAN TO ABOUT 2:15. THERE
[ct=6095.348] IS BUTKER.
[ct=6099.787] HE HAS ALREADY KICKED A 60
[ct=6102.075] YARDER TONIGHT.
[ct=6115.283] AL: MAHOMES IS SACKED BACK AT
[ct=6116.993] THE 36 YARD LINE.
[ct=6120.790] ZACH ALLEN CAME CRASHING
[ct=6121.256] THROUGH.
[ct=6128.437] THE FOURTH DOWN MAKES IT A -- AN
[ct=6133.482] EASY FIELD GOAL MORE
[ct=6133.827] PROBLEMATIC.
[ct=6137.330] RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE A 50 YARD
[ct=6138.098] FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT AND IF HE
[ct=6140.442] MAKES IT IT WOULD BA.2
[ct=6140.930] POSSESSION GAME.
[ct=6145.626] -- IT WOULD BE A TWO POSSESSION
[ct=6151.218] BUTKER BANGS THAT ONE DEAD DOWN
[ct=6152.823] THE MIDDLE@
[ct=6155.791] THE MIDDLLE!
[ct=6158.523] KIRK: WHAT A WEAPON.
[ct=6162.583] ONE POSSESSION, LATE IN THE GAME
[ct=6162.991] AND YOU NEED POINTS.
[ct=6166.337] MAHOMES WITH A RARE MISTAKE
[ct=6166.951] TAKING THAT SACK.
[ct=6171.080] MR. AUTOMATIC PUTS IT RIGHT
[ct=6171.445] THROUGH THE MIDDLE.
[ct=6175.117] AL: FOUR FIELD GOALS TONIGHT.
[ct=6179.803] 52 YARDS.
[ct=6182.891] YOU KNOW, THE DENVER DEFENSE, NO
[ct=6184.411] ONE HAS TAKEN MORE HEAT THAN
[ct=6187.094] FRIENDS JOSEPH.
[ct=6188.429] TO COME IN HERE AND ALLOW ONE
[ct=6190.302] TOUCHDOWN AND MAKE FOUR FIELD
[ct=6193.064] GOALS MAKING A SIGNIFICANT
[ct=6194.841] DIFFERENCE.
[ct=6198.618] KIRK: THE RED ZONE ALONE IS
[ct=6200.539] WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO KEEP
[ct=6200.539] THEM IN THE GAME.
[ct=6202.932] ONE TOUCHDOWN OUT OF FIVE
[ct=6203.272] ATTEMPTS.
[ct=6205.877] THEY GAVE UP SOME YARDS BUT
[ct=6209.738] SQUEEZED THEM WHEN THEY HAD TO.
[ct=6210.522] I UNDERSTAND THAT DENVER IS
[ct=6213.996] WHEN YOU ARE BUILDING THIS THING
[ct=6216.007] FROM THE GROUND UP, IT HAS BEEN
[ct=6217.603] A LONG TIME ALL THE WAY BACK TO
[ct=6222.044] 2016 SINCE THEY HAVE HAD A
[ct=6222.066] WINNING SEASON.
[ct=6225.436] I THINK IT SHOWS YOU WHAT JOSEPH
[ct=6227.127] AND THIS DEFENSE IS CAPABLE OF
[ct=6231.429] AL: THEY HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN TO
[ct=6231.861] THE PLAYOFFS SINCE THEN.
[ct=6235.127] KIRK: THIS IS HOW THEY ENDED UP
[ct=6235.525] GETTING THE PRESSURE.
[ct=6241.442] THEY WALK SO MANY DEFENDERS UP.
[ct=6242.280] SEVEN GUYS ARE UP CLOSE.
[ct=6246.550] THEY MUG AND THEN DROP AND
[ct=6249.222] CONFUSE THE OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=6253.711] ZACH ALLEN PLAYED IN ARIZONA
[ct=6256.454] WITH J.J. WATT.
[ct=6257.702] HE KIND OF LOOKS LIKE HIM THERE
[ct=6259.382] IN HIS UNI.
[ct=6264.417] AL: DENVER HAS ONE TIMEOUT.
[ct=6265.562] FROM THE 25.
[ct=6271.072] WILSON OVER THE MIDDLE AND IT IS
[ct=6273.298] BROKEN UP AT THE VERY LAST
[ct=6273.298] MINUTE.
[ct=6275.745] RIGHT AT MIDFIELD.
[ct=6278.708] MIKE EDWARDS WAS THERE.
[ct=6284.309] KIRK: SPECS CAME OUT AND TALKED
[ct=6284.976] WITH THE MEDIA ABOUT HOW HE HAS
[ct=6288.912] APPRECIATED THIS GUY COMING OVER
[ct=6289.598] FROM TAMPA AND HE HAS
[ct=6291.928] VERSATILITY.
[ct=6293.273] THE BALL IS WELL THROWN.
[ct=6295.702] HE DOES NOT SEE THE BALL BUT NOW
[ct=6297.535] HE DOES ANY FIGHTS THROUGH HIS
[ct=6299.633] ARMS TO DISLODGE THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=6300.919] GREAT PLAY.
[ct=6306.512] THREE-MAN RUSH.
[ct=6306.980] A FLOATER IS CAUGHT.
[ct=6310.939] THE BALL IS OUT! AND KANSAS CITY
[ct=6315.175] HAS IT! TRENT MCDUFFIE KNOCKED
[ct=6315.175] IT OUT.
[ct=6319.070] GAY TAKES IT INTO THE END ZONE
[ct=6319.956] FOR THE CELEBRATION.
[ct=6331.280] ENDING DENVER'S VERY FAIN
[ct=6331.928] HOPES.
[ct=6335.668] KIRK: THIS DEFENSE WILL BE DOING
[ct=6336.494] THIS TO A LOT OF TEAMS THIS
[ct=6340.119] THIS BACKEND IS FLYING TO THE
[ct=6342.718] IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT COVERAGE.
[ct=6347.368] MCDUFFIE IS A SECOND-YEAR PLAYER
[ct=6348.132] OUT OF WASHINGTON.
[ct=6350.114] GREAT PLAY OUT IN SPACE.
[ct=6353.835] HE BRINGS BAD INTENTIONS WITH
[ct=6356.725] AL: THEY CAN RUN IT OUT RIGHT
[ct=6357.188] NOW.
[ct=6363.437] AN 11 POINT DIFFERENCE, A VERY
[ct=6366.140] SIGNIFICANT NUMBER TWO A FEW OF
[ct=6369.231] OUR FRIENDS SINCE GAMES DON'T
[ct=6374.104] END WITH 10.5 IF YOU KNOW WHAT
[ct=6376.038] I'M TALKING ABOUT.
[ct=6377.754] HERE WE ARE NEXT WEEK, JAGUARS
[ct=6378.145] AND SAINTS.
[ct=6381.567] SOME OF OUR FRIENDS ARE
[ct=6381.978] WONDERING WHAT WE ARE TALKING
[ct=6382.306] ABOUT.
[ct=6386.829] BOTH TEAMS COMING HAVE WINNING
[ct=6386.829] RECORDS.
[ct=6392.658] KIRK: A LITTLE FOOD FOR THOUGHT.
[ct=6396.526] CHIEFS NEXT WEEK.
[ct=6397.023] CHARGERS AT DENVER.
[ct=6399.151] MIAMI.
[ct=6401.811] THINK ABOUT THIS, HOW BIG THIS
[ct=6402.420] IS.
[ct=6406.289] THE BILLS COMING UP WITH
[ct=6407.431] HOME-FIELD ADVANTAGE FOR KANSAS
[ct=6409.670] CITY WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE
[ct=6410.532] BIG DIFFERENCE.
[ct=6413.737] WHETHER IT IS BUFFALO OR PLAYING
[ct=6414.333] HERE IN ARROWHEAD.
[ct=6418.687] AL: WORD HAS JUST COME DOWN THAT
[ct=6422.514] TAYLOR SWIFT HAS WRITTEN A FEW
[ct=6423.412] SONGS FOR US INCLUDING PIGSKIN
[ct=6424.686] LOVE STORY.
[ct=6430.391] WE COVER THE WORLD HERE.
[ct=6436.671] KANSAS CITY WINNING ITS LAST 16
[ct=6437.764] REGULAR-SEASON GAMES AGAINST THE
[ct=6438.118] DENVER BRONCOS.
[ct=6442.987] DATING BACK TO THE ROCKIES.
[ct=6445.582] THEY GAVE IT A BATTLE.
[ct=6448.306] THE DEFENSE ALLOWED ONLY ONE TD
[ct=6449.704] OUT OF KANSAS CITY AND THAT DOES
[ct=6450.201] NOT HAPPEN OFTEN.
[ct=6453.169] SEAN PAYTON STILL HAS NOT BEEN
