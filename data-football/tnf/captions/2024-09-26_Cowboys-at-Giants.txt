[ct=7.035] THE GIANTS.
[ct=13.355] MEANWHILE, THE GIANTS WON THE
[ct=13.582] TOSS, THEY WILL DEFER.
[ct=18.490] GREG JOSEPH TO KICK OFF.
[ct=32.085] #9 IS A TOP-NOTCH RECEIVER WHO
[ct=32.660] WILL NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
[ct=33.390] HERE AS IT BOUNCES THROUGH THE
[ct=33.660] END ZONE.
[ct=39.091] DAK PRESCOTT, THE HIGHEST-PAID
[ct=41.479] PLAYER IN THE LEAGUE AT $60
[ct=41.732] MILLION.
[ct=46.471] HE HAS WON HIS LAST 12 STARTS
[ct=46.976] AGAINST THE GIANTS.
[ct=53.329] 26 TD'S, SIX PICKS.
[ct=55.785] THE COWBOYS HAVE TO GET OFF TO A
[ct=56.336] FASTER START.
[ct=66.286] WE WILL SEE ZEKE ELLIOTT, THEY
[ct=70.739] GIVE IT TO DOWDEN WHO TURNS IT
[ct=71.189] INTO A 7 YARD GAME.
[ct=78.680] KIRK: DAK, IN HIS NINTH YEAR
[ct=79.858] CONTROLLING THIS OFFENSE, HAD A
[ct=80.747] CAREER YEAR LAST YEAR.
[ct=83.556] HE WOULD BE THE FIRST WANT TO
[ct=86.954] TELL YOU, HE TALKED ABOUT IT
[ct=88.057] LAST WEEK HOW THEY ARE ANXIOUS
[ct=90.699] TO GET BACK ON THE FIELD.
[ct=92.534] THIS SHORT WEEK CAME AT THE
[ct=92.736] RIGHT TIME.
[ct=98.642] AL: SECOND AND FOUR, BUT GOING
[ct=98.905] NOWHERE, SMOTHERED.
[ct=101.374] NICK MCCLOUD COMES UP FROM THE
[ct=102.635] SECONDARY.
[ct=107.103] IT WILL BE THIRD AND 5, AFTER A
[ct=108.818] LOSS OF ONE.
[ct=111.102] KIRK: THE NEW DEFENSIVE
[ct=113.555] COORDINATOR REALLY SURPRISED A
[ct=115.244] LOT OF PEOPLE LAST WEEK, DIALING
[ct=115.747] UP MORE PRESSURE.
[ct=121.445] BACK HOME ON A SHORT WEEK,
[ct=122.984] GETTING HIS DEFENSE DIALED IN
[ct=122.984] AGAINST THIS RUNNING GAME.
[ct=132.247] AL: FLANKING BACK, PRESCOTT ON
[ct=133.585] THE MOVE THROWS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=137.792] THE CROWD ALREADY ROARING AS
[ct=139.430] ISAIAH SIMMONS PUT THE PRESSURE
[ct=139.681] ON.
[ct=145.423] IT IS VERY FAST, 1:07 THIRD AND
[ct=148.257] OUT.
[ct=152.516] KIRK: NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE
[ct=156.220] BANKS, BUT WORKING OUT TO THE
[ct=158.987] FLAT TO TRY TO HELP IN CASE OF
[ct=160.225] THE INSIDE ROUTE FROM CEEDEE
[ct=160.225] LAMB.
[ct=165.543] THEY ARE TRYING TO ILLUMINATE --
[ct=165.543] ELIMINATE HIM BEING A FACTOR.
[ct=176.064] AL: THE FAIR CATCH IS MADE AT
[ct=176.777] THE 15 YARD LINE.
[ct=183.154] BIG BLUE STARTS FROM THERE.
[ct=186.201] HERE COMES DANIEL JONES, NUMBER
[ct=189.754] SIX OVERALL PICK IN 2019.
[ct=192.459] THE LAST TWO GAMES, VERY GOOD,
[ct=195.530] FOUR TDS AND NO PICKS.
[ct=200.413] KIRK: HE HAS ATHLETIC ABILITY,
[ct=200.620] THE ABILITY TO RUN.
[ct=204.898] LAST WEEK, THE FILM WOULD SHOW,
[ct=207.262] LAMAR JACKSON IS 1-1 BUT I WOULD
[ct=208.591] NOT BE SURPRISED WITH THE
[ct=210.718] ATHLETIC ABILITY TO MIX IT IN
[ct=213.833] EARLY AND GET HIS FEET SETTLED.
[ct=215.155] GET HIS CONFIDENCE GOING.
[ct=220.474] AL: NABERS TOP OF THE SCREEN.
[ct=222.968] A 5 YARD GAME UP TO THE 20 YARD
[ct=224.711] LINE FOR SINGLE TERRY.
[ct=238.229] KIRK: DABOLL COMES OUT WITH I
[ct=240.418] FORMATION WITH JOHNSON LINED UP.
[ct=243.065] THEY WILL TRY TO TEST THAT
[ct=243.266] DALLAS DEFENSIVE
[ct=245.710] HAD A HARD TIME DEFENDING THE
[ct=245.710] RUN.
[ct=253.020] AL: THE RUNNING BACK IS TYRONE
[ct=256.369] TRY SEE ON A SECOND DOWN AND
[ct=256.369] FIVE.
[ct=258.801] EXTRA PROTECTION IN THE
[ct=259.031] BACKFIELD.
[ct=262.155] TRACY GOING NOWHERE.
[ct=265.359] BUNCHED UP AT THE LINE OF
[ct=265.616] SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=269.172] THE GIANTS ARE FACED WITH A
[ct=270.297] THIRD DOWN AND 5.
[ct=275.609] KIRK: YOU CAN SEE THE LINEBACKER
[ct=276.077] GETTING DOWNHILL.
[ct=279.837] IF YOU ARE WONDERING WHAT MIKE
[ct=281.389] ZIMMER MENTIONED EARLIER, HERE
[ct=282.167] IS THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR,
[ct=283.059] THE BIG THINK HE WOULD TALK TO
[ct=286.196] YOU ABOUT IS THE INTERIOR
[ct=286.383] GETTING OFF OF BLOCKS IS
[ct=286.888] IMPORTANT.
[ct=291.466] THE LINEBACKER HAS TO GET
[ct=292.851] DOWNHILL TO HELP OUT WITH THE
[ct=293.079] OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=305.456] AL: JONES BACK TO THROW, WIDE
[ct=307.430] OPEN IS NABERS.
[ct=310.090] WIDE OPEN.
[ct=312.737] 10 YARDS.
[ct=315.009] HE STARTS HIS CAREER THAT WAY
[ct=317.350] AND YOU LET HIM RUN FREE DOWN
[ct=317.568] THE LEFT SIDE LINE.
[ct=322.382] KIRK: CARSON IS OUT SO BOOTH IS
[ct=322.924] IN FOR HIM, GIVES HIM A DOUBLE
[ct=323.147] MOVE.
[ct=327.426] YOU TALK ABOUT DABOL
[ct=330.136] AGGRESSIVE, THAT HIS THIRD DOWN,
[ct=332.979] HE GOES AFTER THE INEXPERIENCED
[ct=333.496] CORNER AND TEST SAME WITH YOUR
[ct=335.671] BEST WEAPON.
[ct=340.955] AL: BOOTH GOT FAKED OUT TOTALLY,
[ct=341.235] 39 YARD GAME.
[ct=344.343] GIANTS TO THE 40 OF DALLAS.
[ct=351.257] TO THE LEFT SIDE ON THE GROUND.
[ct=354.256] GOING NEXT TO NOWHERE IS
[ct=355.586] SINGLETARY.
[ct=358.416] BOOTH MAKING THE TACKLE.
[ct=362.421] DABOLL WAS THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=364.837] COORDINATOR IN BUFFALO.
[ct=370.376] KIRK: THEY LIKE TYRONE CS WELL.
[ct=374.785] SINGLETARY FITS IN PERFECTLY.
[ct=379.061] YOU CAN GET IN FRONT OF THAT NEW
[ct=379.798] OFFENSIVE LINE AND GIVE YOU BIG
[ct=382.441] YARDS IN SHORT YARDAGE
[ct=382.677] SITUATIONS.
[ct=386.489] AL: CARSON IS ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=389.158] SECOND AND 7.
[ct=391.022] JONES WILL KEEP IT, A GOOD
[ct=391.281] RUNNER.
[ct=395.785] ABOUT TWO YARDS SHY OF THE FIRST
[ct=398.478] DOWN, AND WE HAVE A FLAG, THE
[ct=398.975] FIRST OF THE GAME.
[ct=410.395] THE REFEREE IS CLAY MARTIN.
[ct=414.640] ONE OFFICIAL INDICATING A
[ct=415.175] FACEMASK.
[ct=419.919] SOMETIMES IT CAN BE OVERRULED BY
[ct=420.454] SOMEBODY ELSE.
[ct=425.515] >> DURING THE RUN, PERSONAL
[ct=430.368] FOUL, FACEMASK, #82, OFFENSE.
[ct=431.657] 15 YARD PENALTY.
[ct=436.138] AL: THAT IS THE GIANTS TIGHT
[ct=437.369] END, DANIEL BELANGER.
[ct=439.849] IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THIRD AND 2,
[ct=442.481] COMES BACK 15.
[ct=444.644] KIRK: WE TALKED ABOUT THE ZONE
[ct=446.897] READ, HITTING HIM ON THE EDGE.
[ct=449.528] YOU SEE THE FACEMASK.
[ct=453.526] ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU WOULD HAVE
[ct=454.625] SEEN BELANGER.
[ct=457.421] THAT DRIVE WAS GOING WELL.
[ct=461.444] IT WAS GOING WELL CONTROLLING
[ct=462.770] THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, NOW
[ct=464.063] BEHIND THE STICKS.
[ct=468.555] AL: THIRD AND 2 BECOMES SECOND
[ct=469.876] AND 18.
[ct=472.265] FIVE WIDE HERE.
[ct=474.673] QUICKLY LEFT SIDE.
[ct=478.945] ROBINSON MAKES THAT CATCH AT THE
[ct=479.155] 41 YARD LINE.
[ct=486.454] IT WILL BE THIRD AND 11 FOR THE
[ct=487.105] GIANTS.
[ct=491.602] KIRK: YOU HAVE TREVON DIGGS BACK
[ct=492.907] ON THE ACL A YEAR AGO, ONE OF
[ct=494.004] THE TOP CORNERS IN THE LEAGUE,
[ct=496.941] AND YOU HAVE BOOTH, WHO HAS NOT
[ct=499.627] PLAYED A TON WHO IS IN AND
[ct=502.758] DABOLL GOING AFTER HIM.
[ct=505.355] WHAT WILL THEY DO WITH SAFETY
[ct=506.072] SUPPORT OVER THE TOP.
[ct=510.313] THEY WILL CLEARLY CHALLENGE #25
[ct=510.537] TONIGHT.
[ct=513.411] AL: THREE RECEIVERS TO THE RIGHT
[ct=513.906] SIDE.
[ct=518.634] THE BLITZ COMES AND JONES IS
[ct=522.290] FORCED TO THROW QUICKLY, THE
[ct=522.799] CATCH IS MADE SHORT OF THE
[ct=523.060] FIRST.
[ct=526.985] THE BALL NOW AT THE 33 YARD
[ct=527.937] LINE.
[ct=532.915] THAT WILL SET UP A FOURTH AND 4.
[ct=536.931] KIRK: JONES DID A GOOD JOB TO
[ct=538.241] KEEP THE PLAY ALIVE.
[ct=541.385] THEY BROUGHT WILSON UP THE
[ct=542.258] MIDDLE AND HE GOT THROUGH CLEAN
[ct=544.926] BUT ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND
[ct=546.215] GET THE BALL OUT.
[ct=549.420] AL: GREG JOSEPH HAS BEEN AROUND.
[ct=554.209] HE MISSED HIS ONLY FIELD GOAL
[ct=558.173] ATTEMPT LAST WEEK, THIS IS GOOD.
[ct=563.554] THE GIANTS GET ON THE BOARD
[ct=567.576] 3-0ACROSS THE EAST RIVER INTO
[ct=572.815] MANHATTAN, WE ARE 8 MILES FROM
[ct=574.414] MANHATTAN, ACROSS THE HUDSON
[ct=576.066] RIVER IN THE MEADOWLANDS.
[ct=581.584] THE GIANTS ON TOP, AND ANOTHER
[ct=584.248] KICKOFF INTO THE END ZONE, AND A
[ct=584.744] FLAG IS DOWN.
[ct=588.541] SPEAKING OF FLAGS, WE WILL SHOW
[ct=591.420] YOU SOMETHING IN A SECOND ABOUT
[ct=592.089] THE LAST CALL ON THE FACEMASK.
[ct=599.806] MAYBE SOMEBODY MOVED AT THE 30
[ct=600.041] YARD LINE.
[ct=614.720] >> ILLEGAL FORMATION, #1 OF THE
[ct=614.970] RECEIVING TEAM.
[ct=621.092] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=625.053] KIRK: WE WERE TRYING TO FIND A
[ct=627.702] PENALTY AND IF BELANGER GOT INTO
[ct=630.595] THE FACEMASK OF THE LINEBACKER,
[ct=632.107] OVERSHOWN.
[ct=635.665] HE NEVER TOUCHES HIS FACEMASK.
[ct=639.645] #13 DOES GRAB THE FACEMASK.
[ct=643.886] THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FIRST AND
[ct=644.420] 10 THAT THE 17 YARD LINE.
[ct=647.909] AL: THEY DID NOT PUT UP MUCH OF
[ct=648.435] A STINK.
[ct=650.817] PASS OVER THE MIDDLE IS CAUGHT
[ct=654.388] FOR A FOUR YARD GAME.
[ct=661.083] CEEDEE LAMB.
[ct=662.920] A GIANT IS DOWN ON HIS KNEE.
[ct=667.640] LAMB UNHAPPY WITH HIS LACK OF
[ct=673.423] -- UNHAPPY.
[ct=674.273] HE WAS DEMONSTRATIVE ON THE
[ct=674.563] BENCH.
[ct=677.154] HE BASICALLY SAID DURING THE
[ct=681.140] WEEK, "MY FAULT.
[ct=683.795] I NEED TO CONTROL MY EMOTIONS
[ct=685.153] BETTER."
[ct=689.141] KIRK: PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED TO
[ct=689.141] SEE HIM LOSE IT LIKE THAT.
[ct=691.101] I THOUGHT IT WAS STAND UP.
[ct=694.386] GREAT TO SEE HIM COME OUT IN THE
[ct=695.744] MIDDLE OF THE WEEK AND OWN IT.
[ct=701.432] AL:THEY WERE GETTING BLOWN OUT F
[ct=701.954] THE SECOND WEEK IN A ROW.
[ct=705.063] A LOT OF FRUSTRATION ON BOTH
[ct=705.274] SIDES OF THE BALL.
[ct=709.043] HE SAID THAT IS NOT THE PLAYER I
[ct=709.900] AM OR THE TEAMMATE I AM.
[ct=713.469] I WILL BE BETTER IN THE FUTURE.
[ct=719.644] YOU SEE THAT IN COLLEGE AND YOU
[ct=721.045] RARELY SEE THAT SINCE HE HAS
[ct=721.045] BEEN IN THE PROS.
[ct=724.987] KIRK: AS GOOD AS HE IS, HE AND
[ct=728.290] DAK -- STILL FINDING THAT
[ct=728.517] RHYTHM.
[ct=731.609] THEY ARE JUST OFF A BEAT.
[ct=734.981] AT ANY MOMENT THEY COULD GET ON
[ct=735.710] THE SAME PAGE AND THEY CAN PUT
[ct=735.935] UP BIG NUMBERS.
[ct=738.299] AL: SECOND AND 5.
[ct=741.016] DOWDLE STAYS IN.
[ct=743.335] THAT IS CAUGHT BY CEEDEE LAMB.
[ct=746.783] KAYLEE: CEEDEE TOLD ME HE WAS
[ct=750.406] BEING SELFISH AND SUNDAY AND THE
[ct=750.933] WAY HE LET HIS SECOND-QUARTER
[ct=755.768] FUMBLE IRAQ HIS EMOTIONS --
[ct=758.244] ERUPT HIS EMOTIONS.
[ct=761.167] HE SAID HE HAS DEVELOPED A NEW
[ct=764.220] CHARACTER AND HOW TO APPROACH A
[ct=764.734] HEATED SITUATION.
[ct=767.841] HE SAID I WAS PART OF THE
[ct=768.831] PROBLEM AND I WILL BE PART OF
[ct=769.117] THE SOLUTION.
[ct=770.900] AL: HE GETS A BREATHER.
[ct=774.680] THEY HAVE DEUCE VAUGHN IN THE
[ct=777.406] GAME AS THE RUNNING BACK.
[ct=777.667] HE WILL MAKE THE CATCH IN THE
[ct=779.338] FLAT AND OUT TO THE 45 YARD
[ct=783.207] A FLAG IS DOWN.
[ct=789.480] CLAY MARTIN OFF TO A BUSY START
[ct=806.601] IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FOUR-YARD
[ct=806.601] GAIN.
[ct=811.496] REFEREE: THE PASS WAS A FORWARD
[ct=811.496] PASS.
[ct=814.532] PASS INT
[ct=815.984] NUMBER 1.
[ct=819.852] AL: THAT IS ALREADY TWO
[ct=821.191] PENALTIES ON TOLBERT.
[ct=822.518] HE HAD ONE ON THE KICKOFF.
[ct=826.377] KIRK: THIS GIANTS SECONDARY IS
[ct=827.801] UNDERMANNED TONIGHT.
[ct=830.341] IT IS A BIG QUESTION HOW THEY
[ct=831.832] WILL MATCH UP.
[ct=834.369] THE RIGHT CALL ON TOLL BIRDS ON
[ct=837.301] THE PASS INTERFERENCE -- THE
[ct=841.077] RIGHT CALL ON TOLL --
[ct=845.235] TOLBERT ON THE PASS DOWNFIELD.
[ct=847.749] AL: TIGHT FORMATION.
[ct=849.200] A CONVOY.
[ct=851.797] NICE GAIN.
[ct=854.421] GETS OUT TO THE 41 YARD
[ct=856.990] TACKLED BY JASON PENNOCK.
[ct=861.117] KIRK: THAT IS A GOOD WAY TO GET
[ct=861.117] HIM THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=864.871] YOU HAVE A FULLBACK OUT IN
[ct=864.871] FRONT.
[ct=870.482] BEING A NATURAL BALLCARRIER.
[ct=873.052] YOU KNOW WHAT
[ct=874.429] THE CATCH.
[ct=878.442] AL: THE COWBOYS HAVE RUN SIX
[ct=879.816] PLAYS AND HALF OF THEM TO LAMB.
[ct=883.694] TWO CATCHES, ONE RUN.
[ct=885.100] DOWDLE BACK IN.
[ct=888.915] DAK DANCING, THROWS, CAUGHT.
[ct=892.924] FALLING DOWN IS THE TIGHT END
[ct=892.924] JAKE FERGUSON.
[ct=895.616] THAT WILL MAKE IT THIRD DOWN
[ct=897.062] 3.
[ct=900.906] KIRK: HE DID A REALLY NICE JOB
[ct=900.906] OF SADDLING ON HIS ROUTE.
[ct=904.921] IT LOOKED LIKE HE MIGHT CONTINUE
[ct=906.322] THINKING IT WAS MAN-TO-MAN.
[ct=908.978] INSTEAD HE COMES OFF OF IT AND
[ct=908.978] SETTLES.
[ct=910.354] HE RECOGNIZED
[ct=912.900] OUT OF THE WAY.
[ct=917.124] HIM AND DAK ON THE SAME PAGE AND
[ct=918.390] NOW THEY HAVE A SHOT ON THIRD
[ct=919.612] DOWN AND SHORT.
[ct=926.441] AL: FOUR-MAN RUSH.
[ct=931.667] DAK ESCAPES, FIRES INTO TRAFFIC
[ct=933.114] AND THAT IS CAUGHT BY HUNTER
[ct=933.114] LUEPKE.
[ct=934.459] NUMBER 40.
[ct=939.717] FULLBACK/TIGHT END/H BACK,
[ct=941.106] WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL HIM.
[ct=945.105] KIRK: HE CAUGHT A CORNER ROUTE
[ct=947.893] WHEN DAK MADE A GREAT THROW AND
[ct=949.242] HERE IS ANOTHER SCRAMBLE.
[ct=951.998] HE IS STARTING TO LOOK FOR 40
[ct=953.265] WHEN HE GETS INTO TROUBLE.
[ct=957.235] HE IS KNOWN AS A POUNDER BUT HAS
[ct=958.605] ATHLETIC ABILITY.
[ct=962.577] AL: THE NEW MOOSE?
[ct=965.093] 41-YARD LINE.
[ct=967.639] TRYING TO CUT BACK IS RICO
[ct=967.639] DOWDLE.
[ct=970.472] A GAIN OF 1.
[ct=974.350] RAKEEM NUNEZ-ROCHES, WHO NEEDED
[ct=975.749] SOME ASSISTANCE COMING OFF THE
[ct=977.082] FIELD A FEW PLAYS A
[ct=978.273] STOP.
[ct=980.857] KIRK: THEY HAVE SOME SIZE IN THE
[ct=980.857] MIDDLE.
[ct=983.644] DEXTER LAWRENCE IS A CONCERN.
[ct=987.652] THERE IS A LOOK AT ZEKE ELLIOTT,
[ct=991.427] WHO IS BACK IN DALLAS, WEARING
[ct=991.427] NUMBER 15, HIS NUMBER IN
[ct=993.117] COLLEGE.
[ct=998.208] AL: QUICK THROW.
[ct=1003.417] NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT
[ct=1007.459] TO THE 30 YARD LINE HE GOES AND
[ct=1010.290] A FIRST DOWN, TACKLED BY BANKS.
[ct=1013.031] KIRK: DOES A NICE JOB OF GETTING
[ct=1014.461] INTO THE FACE OF DAK PRESCOTT.
[ct=1015.875] THIS IS THE DAK PRESCOTT OF
[ct=1017.225] 2023.
[ct=1019.790] NOT MUCH SEPARATION.
[ct=1022.350] MAYBE INTERFERENCE WITH THE
[ct=1022.350] RIGHT HAND.
[ct=1025.108] LOOK AT WHERE HE P
[ct=1030.429] AL: EIGHTS PLAY OF THE DRIVE.
[ct=1038.247] FIRED, CAUGHT, LAMB TO THE 32.
[ct=1042.274] CEEDEE, WHO HAS MADE A FOUR-
[ct=1047.725] CATCH GAME HIS HOMEWORK, FOUR
[ct=1047.725] ALREADY TONIGHT.
[ct=1050.462] HE HAS ALSO RUN FOR 10 YARDS.
[ct=1054.626] KIRK: IS IT ANY SURPRISE AFTER
[ct=1054.626] THE WEEK LAST WEEK?
[ct=1057.206] THE FRUSTRATIONS WITH DAK ON THE
[ct=1058.596] SIDELINE.
[ct=1061.312] TONIGHT THEY ARE GETTING THE
[ct=1061.312] FOOTBALL INTO
[ct=1062.534] AND OFTEN.
[ct=1063.909] AL: SECOND AND 6.
[ct=1065.360] QUICK THROW.
[ct=1069.336] TACKLED IS TOLBERT INSIDE THE 30
[ct=1078.420] KIRK: A LOT OF US ARE ANXIOUS TO
[ct=1082.255] SEE OUTSIDE OF CEEDEE LAMB, WE
[ct=1085.122] KNOW ABOUT JAKE FERGUSON, THE
[ct=1085.122] POTENTIAL OF BRANDIN COOKS AND
[ct=1087.776] OTHER WEAPONS IN THIS OFFENSE
[ct=1087.776] THAT CAN EMERGE.
[ct=1092.939] PEOPLE HOPING TOLBERT AND OTHERS
[ct=1092.939] CAN DO THAT.
[ct=1101.106] AL: EVEN TURBINE -- EVEN
[ct=1103.804] TURPIN COULD SEE MORE ACTION.
[ct=1107.666] PRESCOTT FIRES, CAUGHT!
[ct=1109.035] COOKS.
[ct=1110.454] FIRST AND GOAL.
[ct=1114.309] TYLER NUBIN, THE ROOKIE OUT OF
[ct=1116.968] MINNESOTA, SAVE THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=1120.938] KIRK: WATCH HOW HE USES JAKE
[ct=1120.938] FERGUSON AS A SHIELD.
[ct=1123.597] HE GETS BEHIND HIM AND MAKES IT
[ct=1127.646] VERY TOUGH FOR HIM TO COME OFF.
[ct=1130.272] ALMOST A SCREEN SET BY THE BIG
[ct=1130.272] TIGHT END.
[ct=1133.118] LOOK AT DAK PRESCOTT.
[ct=1136.763] AL: HE IS 8-8 ON THIS DRIVE.
[ct=1141.036] GIVE IT TO DOWDLE.
[ct=1143.644] HE GETS INTO THE 5.
[ct=1148.710] DEXTER LAWRENCE, BIG NUMBER 97
[ct=1150.174] WITH THE STOP.
[ct=1151.539] SECOND DOWN AND GOAL FROM THE
[ct=1152.744] GIANTS 5-YARD LINE.
[ct=1162.381] COOPER BEEBE MOVED TO CENTER,
[ct=1163.731] MATCHED UP AGAINST THE BEST NOSE
[ct=1163.731] GUARD IN THE NFL.
[ct=1165.114] EXTENDS WITH HIS ARMS.
[ct=1167.663] MAKES THE PLAY.
[ct=1171.725] AL: DAK COMES UP IN THE PISTOL.
[ct=1172.647] SECOND AND GOAL.
[ct=1176.915] SURVEYS, FIRES, TIPPED,
[ct=1178.446] INCOMPLETE.
[ct=1182.528] OKEREKE BREAKING IT UP AT THE
[ct=1182.528] GOAL LINE.
[ct=1183.771] FLAG.
[ct=1186.460] KIRK: WE HAVE A HOLD BY THE
[ct=1186.460] ROOKIE LEFT TACKLE.
[ct=1191.607] REFEREE: HOLDING, OFFENSE,
[ct=1191.607] NUMBER 60.
[ct=1195.425] DOWN.
[ct=1200.185] KIRK: TYPICALLY ON THE OTHER
[ct=1200.185] SIDE OF BRIAN BURNS.
[ct=1202.472] HE COMES AROUND WITH SOME SPEED.
[ct=1205.080] IF YOU ARE CONCERNED WITH
[ct=1207.566] LAWRENCE ON THE INSIDE, YOU WILL
[ct=1210.533] LEAVE A ROOKIE ON THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=1218.595] AL: SECOND DOWN AND GOAL FROM
[ct=1219.982] THE 15-YARD LINE.
[ct=1225.072] THIBODEAUX ON ONE SIDE, BRIAN
[ct=1227.655] BURNS, WHO THEY GOT FROM
[ct=1230.435] CAROLINA, NUMBER 0, ON THE
[ct=1230.435] OTHER.
[ct=1232.969] SECOND DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=1236.830] ANOTHER FLAG IS DOWN.
[ct=1241.417] FLAG DOWN AT THE 10 YARD LINE.
[ct=1245.084] KIRK: I THINK IT WILL BE ANOTHER
[ct=1246.488] HOLD THAT WILL BRING THIS ONE
[ct=1246.488] BACK.
[ct=1251.531] GOOD, TOUGH RUNNING AFTER THE
[ct=1254.246] CATCH BY DOWDLE, RUNNING THROUGH
[ct=1256.944] THE ARM TACKLE OF MCFADDEN INTO
[ct=1258.360] THE END ZONE BUT I THINK IT WILL
[ct=1258.360] COME BACK.
[ct=1263.512] AL: COWBOYS ALREADY BACK AND
[ct=1266.380] RE-HUDDLING.
[ct=1272.806] REFEREE: THERE IS NO FOUL ON THE
[ct=1274.290] PLAY, THE RESULT OF THE PLAY IS
[ct=1274.290] A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=1275.679] AL: WOW.
[ct=1279.590] THE COWBOYS WERE READY TO
[ct=1280.973] HUDDLE, FIGURING IT WAS ON THEM.
[ct=1284.101] BRIAN DABOLL IS SAYING, "WHAT
[ct=1285.982] THE HELL IS GOING ON?"
[ct=1290.711] KIRK: BABY HE GETS HOLD OF THE
[ct=1292.482] JERSEY -- MAYBE HE GETS HOLD OF
[ct=1292.758] THE JERSEY.
[ct=1297.128] THEY PICK IT UP AFTER TALKING IT
[ct=1297.618] OVER AND DALLAS GETS THE
[ct=1298.095] TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=1305.528] AL: REPLAY ASSIST HELPING TO
[ct=1306.013] MAKE THE CALL.
[ct=1314.795] BRANDON AUBREY WITH THE EXTRA
[ct=1315.070] POINT, WHICH IS AUTOMATIC.
[ct=1320.657] WITH 2:06 TO GO IN THE FIRST
[ct=1320.915] QUARTER, BRIAN DABOLL IS
[ct=1321.181] SERIOUS.
[ct=1322.581] NIGHT?
[ct=1327.178] AL: MY MEMORY OF THAT NIGHT WAS
[ct=1327.961] MY HEART WAS POUNDING LIKE
[ct=1328.419] CRAZY.
[ct=1333.104] I SAID TO FRANK IT HAS ALREADY
[ct=1333.618] BEEN A LONG YEAR.
[ct=1336.853] WE WILL GET A RUN BACK.
[ct=1341.900] INSIDE THE 5-YARD LINE BY TYRONE
[ct=1341.900] FOR CP.
[ct=1345.399] OUT TO THE 22 YARD LINE.
[ct=1353.904] KIRK: I THOUGHT 1986 GIANTS,
[ct=1353.904] THAT WAS IN THEIR HEYDAY.
[ct=1357.858] AL: PHILL SIMMS.
[ct=1362.342] BILL PARCELLS ON ONE SIDE, TOM
[ct=1362.860] LANDRY ON THE OTHER.
[ct=1369.825] PHILL SIMMS HAD A PHENOMENAL DAY
[ct=1372.459] IN PASADENA, GOING 22-25.
[ct=1376.429] OPRAH MADE HER SYNDICATED DEBUT
[ct=1376.932] THE SAME DAY.
[ct=1379.582] FIRST AND 10 FROM THE 23 YARD
[ct=1383.144] SINGLE TERRY IS THE RUNNING
[ct=1385.988] FROM THE I-FORMATION.
[ct=1388.993] SINGLE TERRY WILL TAKE THE BALL
[ct=1391.098] OUT TO THE 27 YARD LINE.
[ct=1391.300] A GAIN OF FOUR.
[ct=1393.073] SECOND DOWN AND 6.
[ct=1397.729] KIRK: LAST SERIES THEY HAVE A
[ct=1398.279] TOUGH PENALTY THAT WHEN AGAINST
[ct=1398.561] THEM.
[ct=1405.722] DANIEL JONES WAS 3-3 FOR 53
[ct=1405.722] YARDS.
[ct=1411.342] A BIG EMPHASIS ON THE SHORT WEEK
[ct=1413.194] OF STOPPING THE RUN, BEING MORE
[ct=1413.194] SINGLE.
[ct=1416.852] CHALLENGING.
[ct=1419.079] AL: SINGLETARY AGAIN.
[ct=1423.514] STUFFED AT THE 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=1425.096] ERIC KENDRICKS.
[ct=1428.813] THEY PICKED HIM UP IN HIS 10TH
[ct=1429.566] SEASON IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=1431.145] THIRD AND 3.
[ct=1435.608] KIRK: HE IS ALMOST LIKE A COACH
[ct=1436.127] WITH MIKE ZIMMER COMING OVER.
[ct=1438.473] HE SPENT SO MUCH TIME WITH HIM
[ct=1439.028] IN MINNESOTA.
[ct=1442.255] IT IS HELPING THIS DEFENSE TO
[ct=1442.473] LISTEN TO NUMBER 50.
[ct=1446.228] HE MAKES ADJUSTMENTS ON THE FLY.
[ct=1449.797] BE VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS
[ct=1450.025] DEFENSE.
[ct=1452.291] AL: JONES TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=1457.137] A GREAT STEP BY ROBINSON TO PICK
[ct=1457.656] UP THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1460.931] HE HAD HIM INITIALLY, JOURDAN
[ct=1462.259] LEWIS WAS THERE.
[ct=1463.570] A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1465.667] KIRK: LOOK AT THE MOTION.
[ct=1468.916] HE TRIES TO COMMUNICATE.
[ct=1472.036] YOU SEE THE ADJUSTMENT BY THE
[ct=1472.279] DALLAS DEFENSE.
[ct=1475.240] THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO REACT
[ct=1475.682] QUICKLY ENOUGH.
[ct=1479.636] THAT IS WHAT WAN'DALE ROBINSON
[ct=1479.636] BRINGS TO THE TABLE.
[ct=1485.054] AL: 20 SECONDS UNTIL THE END OF
[ct=1485.290] THE QUARTER.
[ct=1486.400] NABERS.
[ct=1489.749] LOOKED LIKE HE WAS READY TO
[ct=1494.357] THROW BUT PACKS IT IN AND THEY
[ct=1494.357] CHASE HIM OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=1498.363] IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND 13.
[ct=1501.214] CLOCK WILL ROLL AND THAT WILL
[ct=1502.336] TAKE US TO THE END OF THE FIRST
[ct=1502.560] QUARTER.
[ct=1506.751] AL: BRIAN DABOLL IN HIS THIRD
[ct=1506.751] SEASON.
[ct=1510.737] COACH OF THE YEAR TWO YEARS AGO.
[ct=1514.141] 7-12 SINCE.
[ct=1518.732] AL MICHAELS, KIRK, KAYLEE
[ct=1521.191] HARTUNG AS WE START THE SECOND
[ct=1525.585] DANIEL JONES IS 4 FOR HIS FIRST
[ct=1529.383] 4, FOR 57 YARDS.
[ct=1532.587] ROBINSON HAS CAUGHT THREE.
[ct=1535.151] GOING EMPTY.
[ct=1538.623] NABERS IN THE SLOT TO THE LEFT.
[ct=1543.990] JONES LOOKS THAT WAY, FIRES THAT
[ct=1545.035] WAY TO THE 35.
[ct=1546.825] NABERS MAKES THE GRAB.
[ct=1550.348] HE DROPPED IT.
[ct=1553.503] IT REMAINS THIRD DOWN AND 14.
[ct=1556.836] KIRK: MIKE ZIMMER IS DOING A
[ct=1557.932] REALLY GOOD JOB OF ROTATING
[ct=1558.514] EARLY IN THIS GAME.
[ct=1562.181] YOU SEE DIFFERENT DEFENSIVE
[ct=1567.027] LINEMEN RUNNING ON IT OFF THE
[ct=1567.271] FIELD.
[ct=1570.698] THEY LOST SO MANY FAMILIAR FACES
[ct=1570.698] FROM LAST YEAR.
[ct=1579.972] AL: THIRD DOWN AND 14.
[ct=1582.823] JUMPING ACROSS.
[ct=1584.639] A FREE PLAY COMING.
[ct=1586.617] FLAG DOWN.
[ct=1590.597] DOWN THE FIELD, IT IS PICKED OFF
[ct=1590.823] BUT WE KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN.
[ct=1594.822] THAT IS DIGGS FOR THE MOMENT BUT
[ct=1595.642] THE COWBOYS KNOW WHAT THE STORY
[ct=1595.893] WILL BE.
[ct=1599.388] CARL LAWSON TIM ACROSS EARLY.
[ct=1605.384] REFEREE: OFFSIDES, DEFENSE,
[ct=1606.697] NUMBER 55.
[ct=1608.025] REPLAY THIRD DOWN.
[ct=1612.014] KIRK: GOOD HARD COUNT ENDS UP
[ct=1614.652] PULLING LAWSON OVER.
[ct=1617.334] HE KNEW HE HAD A FREE PLAY.
[ct=1619.970] HE WAS BEHIND DIGGS.
[ct=1623.311] DIGGS PLAYS IT WELL LIKE A
[ct=1626.039] RECEIVER BUT IF HE PUTS IT OUT
[ct=1627.334] IN FRONT DOWNFIELD, THAT
[ct=1629.251] POTENTIALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A
[ct=1629.555] HUGE PLAY.
[ct=1631.095] AL: LAWSON
[ct=1633.726] TODAY.
[ct=1635.766] KIRK: STILL THIRD AND 10.
[ct=1639.043] AL: THIRD DOWN AND 9.
[ct=1644.330] NABERS AND DIGGS MATCHED UP, TOP
[ct=1644.330] OF THE SCREEN.
[ct=1648.311] JONES LOOKS THE OTHER WAY.
[ct=1651.486] THAT IS CAUGHT BY ROBINSON.
[ct=1653.648] GREAT MOVE!
[ct=1656.505] NEEDED NINE, GOT 11.
[ct=1659.445] BROKE AWAY FROM ERIC KENDRICKS.
[ct=1662.930] ROBINSON ALREADY WITH FOUR
[ct=1665.071] TARGETS AND FOUR CATCHES.
[ct=1667.442] KIRK: HE HAS A REAL CHANCE TO
[ct=1671.339] COMPLEMENT WHAT NABERS CAN DO.
[ct=1674.930] HE CAN MAKE ERIC KENDRICKS MISS.
[ct=1678.370] HE STILL HAS ANOTHER SEVEN YARDS
[ct=1679.331] TO GO TO PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=1688.333] AL: PLAY-ACTION.
[ct=1690.419] HANGS IN THE POCKET.
[ct=1692.305] FIRES!
[ct=1697.650] CAUGHT, SPINNING, SLATON.
[ct=1700.292] JUGGLES, OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=1705.632] KIRK: THIS IS A GREAT JOB OF
[ct=1705.845] PICKING THE BLITZ UP IN THE
[ct=1706.691] BACKFIELD BY SINGLETARY.
[ct=1710.905] HE WILL PICK UP THIS NICKEL
[ct=1712.232] BLITZED BY LEWIS AND THAT ALLOWS
[ct=1713.933] DANIEL JONES TO GET HIS FEET
[ct=1714.277] SET.
[ct=1716.708] RIGHT OVER THE LINEBACKER
[ct=1716.945] KENDRICKS.
[ct=1724.547] YOU LOVE TO SEE ANOTHER GIANTS
[ct=1725.095] RECEIVER MAKING A CATCH.
[ct=1728.199] DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO KEEP
[ct=1728.974] NUMBER 11 OUT OF THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=1730.957] AL: 28 YARD GAIN.
[ct=1734.910] GOING FIVE WIDE HERE.
[ct=1736.212] RUSH FOUR.
[ct=1738.955] JONES DEEP.
[ct=1745.522] PULLED IN AT THE 2-YARD LINE.
[ct=1746.288] WE HAVE ANOTHER FLAG, THOUGH.
[ct=1749.035] KIRK: I DO NOT THINK THE GIANTS
[ct=1749.334] WERE SET.
[ct=1754.320] THEY HAD MOVEMENT BY THE
[ct=1754.606] ROOKIE TIGHT ENDS.
[ct=1759.049] AL: THE TEAMS ARE WALKING BACK
[ct=1759.509] UP THE FIELD.
[ct=1764.331] REFEREE: ILLEGAL SHIFT, OFFENSE.
[ct=1768.326] THERE WERE TWO PLAYERS MOVING AT
[ct=1769.105] THE SAME TIME AND NUMBER 29 DID
[ct=1771.032] NOT RESET PRIOR TO THE SNAP.
[ct=1773.050] AL: THAT WAS TRACY.
[ct=1776.875] KIRK: YOU HAD THE ROOKIE TRACY
[ct=1778.088] AND THE ROOKIE JOHNSON.
[ct=1780.596] MAKING SURE THEY UNDERSTOOD THEY
[ct=1780.596] WERE ON THE RIGHT PAGE.
[ct=1786.265] ONCE HE COMES OUT, IT WAS A
[ct=1787.658] RUNNING BACK THE PLAYED RECEIVER
[ct=1788.915] EARLY AT IOWA.
[ct=1791.702] LOOK AT THEM COMMUNICATING.
[ct=1794.311] BY THE TIME THEY FIGURED OUT
[ct=1795.340] WHAT WAS GOING ON, THE BALL IS
[ct=1796.909] SNAPPED AND THEY ARE NOT SET.
[ct=1802.425] AL: FIRST AND 15.
[ct=1805.018] ON THE GROUND.
[ct=1808.846] A GAIN OF A YARD.
[ct=1810.838] ERIC GRAY.
[ct=1816.169] THEY GO WITH THREE BACKS WHO CAN
[ct=1819.998] CARRY THE BALL -- SINGLETARY,
[ct=1821.462] TRACY AND GRAY.
[ct=1823.015] AND THEN YOU HAVE NABERS.
[ct=1825.656] KIRK: GREAT JOB BY DALLAS.
[ct=1829.824] THE HUGE STORY HAS BEEN WHAT IS
[ct=1831.172] GOING ON WITH THE INTERIOR OF
[ct=1831.172] THE COWBOYS DEFENSE.
[ct=1835.485] THAT IS THEIR JOB -- EAT UP THE
[ct=1840.601] FREE.
[ct=1842.994] AL: SECOND AND 14.
[ct=1844.390] JONES FLUSHED.
[ct=1846.969] JONES FIRES ON THE RUN.
[ct=1849.794] 26 YARD LINE.
[ct=1853.889] WAN'DALE ROBINSON MAKING ANOTHER
[ct=1856.604] CATCH TO SET UP A THIRD DOWN AND
[ct=1856.604] 9.
[ct=1860.441] JONES HAS COMPLETED SEVEN PASSES
[ct=1864.440] TONIGHT IN EIGHT ATTEMPTS, FIVE
[ct=1864.440] OF THOSE TO ROBINSON.
[ct=1873.581] AND NOW THEY ARE GOING TO HELP
[ct=1876.346] PARSONS OFF TO THE SIDELINE.
[ct=1880.222] THE OFFICIALS SEE THAT HE TOOK A
[ct=1880.222] BLOW.
[ct=1884.681] THAT IS NORMALLY NOTED FROM
[ct=1885.717] OFF THE FIELD.
[ct=1888.553] KIRK: HE STAYED DOWN AFTER THE
[ct=1889.788] COLLISION.
[ct=1891.112] IT WAS NEAR THE END OF THE PLAY.
[ct=1895.120] IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FRIENDLY FIRE
[ct=1895.120] FROM ONE OF HIS OWN PLAYERS.
[ct=1900.673] AS HE COMES OVER AT THE END, YOU
[ct=1903.174] WILL SEE A COWBOYS PLAYER COME
[ct=1903.174] DOWN ON TOP OF HIM.
[ct=1905.868] HE STAYED DOWN FOR A MOMENT AND
[ct=1905.868] THAT IS WHY TH
[ct=1907.345] HIM OFF.
[ct=1912.710] JONES FIRES.
[ct=1916.776] A LITTLE BEHIND NABERS,
[ct=1918.245] REACHES BACK AND MAKES THE
[ct=1918.245] CATCH.
[ct=1920.915] THAT BRINGS UP A FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=1924.950] KIRK: HOW ABOUT THAT PLAY IN THE
[ct=1925.186] LINEBACKER, OVERSHOWN.
[ct=1927.814] YOU KNOW THE ARE GOING TO TRY TO
[ct=1928.595] GET IT TO NABERS.
[ct=1932.592] OVERSHOWN PLAYED SOME SAFETY AT
[ct=1932.856] TEXAS.
[ct=1935.919] THAT IS A TOUGH TACKLE TO MAKE
[ct=1936.196] AGAINST NABERS.
[ct=1939.395] HE IS PHYSICAL, HE IS QUICK.
[ct=1942.851] AL: GREG JOSEPH NOW TO TRY TO
[ct=1943.969] MAKE IT 7-6.
[ct=1947.731] 41-YARD ATTEMPT.
[ct=1950.400] SNAP A LITTLE HIGH.
[ct=1953.028] HE GETS IT DOWN.
[ct=1956.372] PLAY WITH
[ct=1958.871] PARSONS NEAR THE END, TRIES TO
[ct=1960.352] GET INVOLVED IN A TACKLE, MAZI
[ct=1962.875] SMITH TRYING TO FINISH IT OFF.
[ct=1965.002] A COLLISION AT THE END.
[ct=1967.409] HIS LOWER HALF MAYBE HIT THE
[ct=1968.848] HEAD OF PARSONS.
[ct=1971.564] PARSONS DID NOT AGREE BUT HE WAS
[ct=1972.995] TAKEN OFF THE FIELD.
[ct=1978.657] AL: HE IS IN THE BLUE TENT.
[ct=1979.931] WE WILL GET A REPORT AS SOON AS
[ct=1979.931] WE CAN.
[ct=1982.222] JOSEPH TO KICK OFF.
[ct=1986.832] COWBOYS ON TOP, 7-6.
[ct=1992.148] EACH TEAM COMING IN GAME THUS FA
[ct=1996.118] EZEKIEL ELLIOTT IS IN THE
[ct=1999.936] ZEKE CAME UP AS A ROOKIE END
[ct=2001.310] LEAD THE LEAGUE IN RUSHING.
[ct=2004.139] FOURTH OVERALL PICK.
[ct=2008.202] KAYLEE: MICAH PARSONS WAS HANDED
[ct=2008.202] HIS HELMET BACK.
[ct=2009.621] HE IS SITTING ON THE BENCH.
[ct=2013.347] WE DO NOT HAVE CONFIRMATION ON
[ct=2013.347] HIS STATUS.
[ct=2016.076] THEY BROUGHT EVERYONE IN THE
[ct=2017.164] BLUE TENT THEY COULD FIT,
[ct=2019.763] INCLUDING THE TRAUMA CONSULTANT.
[ct=2024.933] HE IS OUT OF THE TENT AND BACK
[ct=2024.933] ON THE SIDELINE.
[ct=2027.585] AL: AND WITH HIS HELMET.
[ct=2028.934] GOOD NEWS FOR THE COWBOYS.
[ct=2031.663] SECOND DOWN AND 5.
[ct=2034.423] TAKEN DOWN IN THE BACKFIELD IS
[ct=2037.127] PRESCOTT AFTER THE FAKE HANDOFF.
[ct=2040.858] DALLAS FACED WITH A THIRD DOWN
[ct=2042.180] AND 5.
[ct=2045.000] KIRK: I WONDER IF THIS IS A
[ct=2045.000] READ.
[ct=2047.636] IF IT IS A READ, HE MAKES THE
[ct=2049.046] WRONG READ.
[ct=2050.407] HE IS READING 51.
[ct=2055.784] IF HE STAYS WIDE, YOU HAVE TO
[ct=2055.784] HAND THE BALL TO ZEKE ELLIOTT.
[ct=2063.775] AL: PRESSURE.
[ct=2067.910] CAUGHT, CAN HE GET THE FIRST
[ct=2067.910] DOWN?
[ct=2070.614] LOSES THE BALL AS HE GOES OUT OF
[ct=2072.034] BOUNDS.
[ct=2074.841] OFFICIALS READY TO SPOT IT A
[ct=2076.321] LITTLE BIT SHORT.
[ct=2077.600] FERGUSON MAKING THE GRAB.
[ct=2081.469] TACKLE IS MADE BY NUBIN.
[ct=2086.714] THEY WILL MARKET JUST SHY OF THE
[ct=2086.714] 40 IN
[ct=2088.117] WITHOUT A HUDDLE.
[ct=2090.846] KIRK: UNDER CENTER.
[ct=2093.668] YOU EXPECT THEM TO SNEAK IT.
[ct=2097.137] AL: INSTEAD, STARTS THE HARD
[ct=2097.137] COUNT.
[ct=2100.141] WILL THEY REALLY GO?
[ct=2101.481] THEY WILL.
[ct=2102.886] THE FULLBACK.
[ct=2107.047] HERE GOES LUEPKE AGAIN!
[ct=2109.681] STARTED TO LOSE HIS BALANCE BUT
[ct=2112.391] KEPT AND GOT TO THE 45 YARD
[ct=2115.058] GOT THROUGH A WOULD BE TACKLED
[ct=2117.765] BY THIBODEAUX WHI
[ct=2119.188] CREATED A TURNOVER ON DOWNS.
[ct=2121.886] KIRK: IT OPENS UP THE EDGE.
[ct=2125.919] LUEPKE SHOWING OVER THE LAST FEW
[ct=2127.026] WEEKS, YOU ARE NOT USED TO
[ct=2129.985] SEEING A LOT OF FULLBACKS BEING
[ct=2131.389] ABLE TO SHOW WHAT THEY CAN DO
[ct=2131.389] WITH THE BALL IN HIS HANDS.
[ct=2134.096] HE HAS THAT ABILITY.
[ct=2136.803] AL: SECOND YEAR OUT OF NORTH
[ct=2136.803] DAKOTA STATE.
[ct=2139.342] HERE GOES LAMB.
[ct=2143.545] HE IS FREE ON THE INSIDE.
[ct=2144.554] CEEDEE LAMB, TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=2148.698] FOR A CHANGE, NO FLAG.
[ct=2152.693] HE GOT AWAY FROM BANKS.
[ct=2155.554] NOW THEY SAY THERE IS A FLAG AT
[ct=2155.554] THE END.
[ct=2158.021] WHERE IS IT?
[ct=2160.712] IT IS DOWN OF THE GOAL LINE.
[ct=2164.610] YOU NEVER WANT
[ct=2166.052] WITH THIS CREW.
[ct=2168.837] KIRK: RIGHT.
[ct=2170.104] AL: THEY HUDDLE.
[ct=2172.729] IS IT AFTER HE SCORED?
[ct=2176.627] REFEREE: THE RESULT OF THE PLAY
[ct=2176.627] IS A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=2182.150] AFTER THE PLAY, UNSPORTSMANLIKE
[ct=2184.955] CONDUCT, TAUNTING, NUMBER 88,
[ct=2184.955] DALLAS.

[ct=2188.618] DISQUALIFICATION.
[ct=2191.285] 15-YARD PENALTY W
[ct=2192.452] ON THE TRY.
[ct=2195.088] KIRK: LOOK AT THE SAFETIES
[ct=2196.567] PRE-SNAP.
[ct=2200.622] MIDDLEFIELD SAFETY, ONE ON ONE.
[ct=2203.293] REALLY WELL DONE BY DAK
[ct=2203.293] PRESCOTT.
[ct=2204.509] SAFETY COMES DOWN.
[ct=2205.982] BLITZ.
[ct=2208.632] ONE-ON-ONE ON ONE, YOU HAVE TO
[ct=2209.846] GO TO CEEDEE LAMB.
[ct=2212.554] TAKE IT EVERY TIME AGAINST BANKS
[ct=2213.990] AND HE WINS IT.
[ct=2220.667] AL: AND THEN, TAUNTING, I GUESS.
[ct=2226.185] THIS MAKES IT A 48-YARD EXTRA
[ct=2226.185] POINT.
[ct=2231.564] FOR AUBREY, THAT IS
[ct=2233.005] REMOTE ISSUE.
[ct=2235.325] THE COWBOYS GET THE TD.
[ct=2239.493] 9:16 TO GO IN THE FIRST HALF AND
[ct=2241.252] THEY LEAD 14-6 ON THURSDAY
[ct=2242.678] FOOTBALL.
[ct=2250.592] ♪AND BRANDON AUBREY KICKED A 65-
[ct=2251.731] YARD FIELD GOAL LAST SUNDAY.
[ct=2253.180] HE HITS A LINE DRIVE TO THE 5.
[ct=2265.229] KIRK: LET'S TAKE A PEEK AT
[ct=2265.229] PARSONS SO FAR.
[ct=2269.173] GIANTS ARE WELL AWARE OF HIM.
[ct=2270.638] THEY ID HIM.
[ct=2273.328] ZONE READ.
[ct=2275.867] ANOTHER ONE WHERE YOU ARE
[ct=2278.819] KEEPING HIM UNTOUCHED, MAKING
[ct=2278.819] HIM MAKE A DECISION.
[ct=2281.377] ZERO PRESSURES.
[ct=2283.912] HE HAS ONLY BEEN DOUBLE-TEAMED
[ct=2283.912] ONCE.
[ct=2286.662] HE STAYS HOME WELL, CHASES
[ct=2292.198] HE IS OFF, STILL, HOLDING HIS
[ct=2292.198] HELMET.
[ct=2296.239] AL: SINGLETARY.
[ct=2300.047] SLIPS TO THE OUTSIDE, BALL IS
[ct=2302.919] OUT BUT THEY WILL SAY HE WAS
[ct=2304.357] DOWN BY CONTACT.
[ct=2306.984] KENDRICKS RIGHT THERE.
[ct=2309.822] DOWN BY CONTACT, GAIN OF TWO.
[ct=2313.759] REFEREE: THE RULE ON THE FIELD
[ct=2313.759] IS A RUNNER WAS DOWN BY CONTACT.
[ct=2317.763] AL: SINGLETARY HAS FUMBLED IN
[ct=2320.333] EACH OF HIS LAST TWO GAMES AND
[ct=2320.333] HAS 16 IN HIS CAREER.
[ct=2322.992] KIRK: HE TALKED ABOUT IT THIS
[ct=2324.057] WEEK.
[ct=2326.800] THE BALL, IS IT STARTING TO COME
[ct=2328.224] OUT?
[ct=2329.543] NO.
[ct=2334.920] AL: THE KNEE IS DOWN.
[ct=2337.457] CHALLENGE THIS.
[ct=2340.203] AL: YOU SEE WHAT WE SEE.
[ct=2344.020] KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE IT STARTED
[ct=2345.410] TO MOVE BUT IT WAS NOT CLEAR.
[ct=2348.039] SURFACE.
[ct=2350.631] AL: MEANWHILE, SINGLETARY
[ct=2352.117] WORKED ON.
[ct=2356.091] REFEREE: DALLAS IS CHALLENGING
[ct=2358.906] THE RULING ON THE FIELD THAT THE
[ct=2358.906] RUNNER WAS DOWN BY CONTACT.
[ct=2360.244] TIMEOUT.
[ct=2363.161] AL: IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A TWO-
[ct=2365.994] YARD GAIN TO THE 30.
[ct=2367.372] THEY WILL CHECK IT OUT AND WE
[ct=2372.451] REFEREE: AFTER REVIEW, THE
[ct=2373.907] RULING ON THE FIELD DOES STAND
[ct=2376.674] AS CALLED, THE RUNNER IS DOWN BY
[ct=2376.674] CONTACT.
[ct=2379.119] THIS IS AN UNSUCCESSFUL
[ct=2380.671] CHALLENGE BY DALLAS.
[ct=2382.126] THEY WILL BE CHARGED THEIR FIRST
[ct=2384.892] AL: IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND
[ct=2384.892] 8.
[ct=2389.145] MEANWHILE, SINGLETARY WENT OVER
[ct=2390.373] TO THE SIDELINE TO GET CHECKED
[ct=2393.158] ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAVE MICAH
[ct=2394.531] PARSONS WHO WAS OUT AND IS BACK
[ct=2395.658] IN.
[ct=2399.710] KIRK: YOU HEARD HIM SAY THE KNEE
[ct=2402.311] WAS DOWN, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE
[ct=2402.311] FOCUSING ON THE ELBOW.
[ct=2404.991] TRACY.
[ct=2406.491] SECOND AND 8.
[ct=2411.848] JONES IS 8 OF HIS FIRST 9.
[ct=2413.309] PAST NUMBER 10.
[ct=2414.468] GOING DEEP.
[ct=2415.854] COVERAGE IS GREAT.
[ct=2419.976] BATTED AWAY.
[ct=2422.571] MALIK HOOKER GOT OVER THERE.
[ct=2425.461] YOU HAD A GREAT BATTLE GOING ON.
[ct=2428.235] NABERS AND DIGGS.
[ct=2431.876] HELP OVER THE TOP FROM HOOKER TO
[ct=2433.492] BAT IT AWAY.
[ct=2438.968] KIRK: WE KNOW NABERS IS CAPABLE
[ct=2438.968] OF MAKING HUGE PLAYS.
[ct=2439.612] YOU ARE GOING TO THROW
[ct=2442.849] YOU ROLL OUT AND THROW ALL THE
[ct=2444.272] WAY BACK.
[ct=2446.992] IT IS NOT JUST DIGGS, IT IS
[ct=2448.376] REALLY GOOD RANGE BY HOOKER,
[ct=2450.858] PLAYING CENTERFIELD.
[ct=2453.733] HE WENT 20 OR 30 YARDS TO GET
[ct=2453.733] OVER THERE.
[ct=2457.000] AL: ALABAMA COVERING LSU.
[ct=2458.837] THIRD DOWN AND 8.
[ct=2463.960] JONES SLIDES LEFT, FIRES, CAUGHT
[ct=2465.384] AT THE 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=2468.127] BROUGHT IN BY NABERS.
[ct=2470.830] THAT TIME, BOOTH WAS COVERING.
[ct=2473.353] KIRK: WHAT A JOB SELLING THIS
[ct=2474.514] ROUTE DOWNFIELD.
[ct=2477.200] HE GETS THE YOUNG AND
[ct=2478.536] INEXPERIENCED CORNER TO TURN.
[ct=2484.171] HE SELLS IT, GOES BY HIM.
[ct=2486.448] ONCE HE TURNS HIS SHOULDERS, IT
[ct=2490.607] IS OVER.
[ct=2490.607] EVEN THOUGH IT IS THIRD AND
[ct=2493.251] LONG, I AM SURPRISED HE TURNED,
[ct=2493.251] KNOWING THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE
[ct=2496.133] HE WOULD WORK BACK AND TRY TO
[ct=2496.133] GET TO THE FIRST DOWN MARKER.
[ct=2501.496] AL: WITH THE FULLBACK IN THERE.
[ct=2502.956] LOOK OUT.
[ct=2505.714] FLIPPED DOWN.
[ct=2509.900] MAZI SMITH TAKES CARE OF TYRONE
[ct=2509.900] TRACY FOR NO GAIN.
[ct=2513.767] SECOND DOWN AND 10, HALFWAY
[ct=2513.767] THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER.
[ct=2516.290] DALLAS UP, 14-6.
[ct=2520.083] KIRK: THERE WAS A BIG EMPHASIS
[ct=2522.753] FROM MIKE ZIMMER ABOUT GETTING
[ct=2524.198] OFF OF BLOCKS AND TACKLING.
[ct=2526.958] THEY CAME IN ALLOWING 5.4 YARDS
[ct=2531.045] PER CARRY, DEAD LAST.
[ct=2536.298] TONIGHT, 2 YARDS PER CARRY.
[ct=2538.964] AL: THIS WAS THE DEFENSE
[ct=2540.071] WAS FIFTH BEST IN THE LEAGUE
[ct=2541.495] LAST YEAR.
[ct=2543.019] SECOND AND 10.
[ct=2545.794] CATCH MADE AT THE 42, NABERS
[ct=2546.831] MAKING THE GRAB.
[ct=2549.445] KAYLEE: MICAH PARSONS EVALUATED
[ct=2552.102] FOR A NECK INJURY IN THE MEDICAL
[ct=2552.102] TENT.
[ct=2557.315] THE CONCERN WAS A STINGER, AN
[ct=2557.315] IRRITATION OF A NERVE.
[ct=2561.097] THAT EXPLAINS WHY THEY NEEDED
[ct=2562.538] IN THE TENT WITH HIM.
[ct=2566.297] AL: THANK YOU, DR. HARTUNG.
[ct=2569.076] KIRK: ANOTHER THIRD DOWN FOR THE

[ct=2575.911] AL: SINGLETARY BACK IN.
[ct=2577.497] THIRD AND 8.
[ct=2580.347] SLIDING LEFT AGAIN.
[ct=2584.429] CAUGHT AT THE 50-YARD LINE.
[ct=2589.511] ROBINSON, MAKING THE CATCH.
[ct=2594.967] THEY WILL MARK IT A LITTLE BIT
[ct=2600.321] SHY OF THE 50-YARD LINE, ABOUT A
[ct=2601.672] HALF YARD SHY OF A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2604.357] OF COURSE, THE CROWD WANTS THEM
[ct=2605.594] TO GO FOR IT.
[ct=2606.625] IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WILL.
[ct=2609.540] KIRK: DANIEL JONES WAS ABLE TO
[ct=2609.540] AVOID MICAH PARSONS.
[ct=2612.265] THEY HAVE A GREAT SHOT OF
[ct=2615.034] PICKING UP THIS FIRST DOWN AT
[ct=2615.034] MIDFIELD.
[ct=2616.505] HEAVY ON THE RIGHT.
[ct=2625.317] AL: SINGLETARY IN THE BACKFIELD,
[ct=2628.066] IN TROUBLE BUT GETS HIMSELF OUT
[ct=2629.488] OF TROUBLE AND PICKS UP THE
[ct=2633.530] GOT AWAY FROM DONOVAN WILSON,
[ct=2636.191] WHO HAD HIM IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=2636.191] COULD NOT SECURE THE TACKLE.
[ct=2638.867] FIRST DOWN, NEW YORK.
[ct=2641.759] KIRK: THEY WENT WITH THREE TIGHT
[ct=2644.406] ENDS.
[ct=2645.709] HERE IS WILSON ON THE SHORT EDGE
[ct=2647.014] OF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE OFFENSE.
[ct=2648.243] RIGHT THERE!
[ct=2651.140] WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY
[ct=2651.140] WERE TACKLING BETTER.
[ct=2653.887] THAT WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNI
[ct=2655.191] GET OFF THE FIELD.
[ct=2656.213] THERE IS WHAT SINGLETARY CAN
[ct=2657.528] BRING.
[ct=2660.272] 5'7", 203.
[ct=2662.933] REALLY GOOD CONTACT BALANCE.
[ct=2665.850] SPINS OUT AND PICKS UP THE FIRST
[ct=2668.354] WHAT A SEQUENCE OF PLAYS FOR THE
[ct=2672.466] AL: MEANWHILE, YOU HAVE
[ct=2676.702] OVERSHOWN AND HE IS SLOW IN
[ct=2676.702] GETTING UP.
[ct=2680.585] SECOND YEAR BACKER OUT OF TEXAS.
[ct=2686.018] THIRD-ROUND PICK IN LAST YEAR'S
[ct=2686.018] DRAFT.
[ct=2688.826] HE WILL COME OUT FOR AT LEAST
[ct=2689.989] ONE PLAY.
[ct=2692.679] KIRK: NUMBER 13 HAS BEEN ALL
[ct=2692.679] OVER THE FIELD.
[ct=2696.433] JUST TRYING TO STRIP AT THE
[ct=2700.600] ONCE YOU HAVE THE REPUTATION OF
[ct=2702.704] BEING A FUMBLE OR, THAT DEFENSE
[ct=2702.704] IS DOING ANYTHING THEY C
[ct=2708.158] AL: YEARS AGO TIKI BARBER HAD
[ct=2711.242] THAT ISSUE AND TOM COUGHLIN GOT
[ct=2711.242] HIM TO
[ct=2712.613] TIGHT.
[ct=2714.036] KIRK: THAT IS RIGHT.
[ct=2716.496] AL: THE FUMBLES WENT AWAY.
[ct=2717.824] KIRK: OLD SCHOOL.
[ct=2720.433] AL: VERY.
[ct=2723.351] FROM THE 48-YARD LINE.
[ct=2725.863] PLAY-ACTION.
[ct=2729.778] SINGLETARY HAS SOME ROOM TO
[ct=2731.158] ROAM.
[ct=2735.023] PICKS UP 14 AND A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2738.725] OSA ODIGHIZUWA MAKING THE
[ct=2740.237] TACKLE.
[ct=2744.473] KIRK: THE OFFENSE OF THE GIANTS,
[ct=2745.223] THERE IS SO MUCH TALK ABOUT THE
[ct=2748.345] SKILL WITH NABERS AND ROBINSON
[ct=2751.102] BUT IF I AM A GIANTS FAN, I
[ct=2751.858] REALLY LIKE THE THREE NEW PIECES
[ct=2751.858] THEY BROUGHT IN.
[ct=2756.352] JON RUNYAN GETTING DOWNFIELD,
[ct=2757.270] JOHN MICHAEL SCHMITZ, THE
[ct=2759.034] SECOND-YEAR CENTER.
[ct=2761.699] DANIEL JONES IS ABLE TO WORK IN
[ct=2764.274] THEY ARE ABLE TO
[ct=2765.736] FOOTBALL BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY
[ct=2768.308] HAVE UP FRONT.
[ct=2769.570] SO MUCH BETTER THAN THEY WERE A
[ct=2769.570] YEAR AGO.
[ct=2777.582] AL: STOPPED AFTER A GAIN OF TWO.
[ct=2781.760] TRACY, THE ROOKIE FROM PURDUE.
[ct=2783.234] PICKED HIM UP IN THE FOURTH
[ct=2783.234] ROUND.
[ct=2786.121] SECOND DOWN AND 8.
[ct=2790.138] KIRK: GOOD JOB OF CHANGING UP
[ct=2790.138] LOOKS BY BRIAN DABOLL.
[ct=2793.986] DIFFERENT FORMATIONS, DIFFERENT
[ct=2795.492] WAYS OF ATTACKING DALLAS.
[ct=2798.129] GIVING THEM DIFFERENT LOOKS,
[ct=2798.129] TRYING TO SLOW THEM DOWN WITH
[ct=2802.508] PRE-SNAP MOVEMENT, MOVING NABERS
[ct=2803.848] AROUND.
[ct=2805.973] AL: SECOND AND 9.
[ct=2809.142] AND A WHISTLE.
[ct=2815.744] CLAY MARTIN.
[ct=2823.616] REFEREE: 12 MEN IN FORMATION ON
[ct=2823.616] THE DEFENSE WITH THE SNAP
[ct=2825.045] IMMINENT.
[ct=2827.679] FIVE-YARD PENALTY, SECOND DOWN.
[ct=2831.508] KIRK: THEY HAVE BEEN ROTATING A
[ct=2831.508] LOT OF PLAYERS.
[ct=2834.258] THERE IS 11, THERE IS NUMBER 12.
[ct=2838.302] I JUST TALKED ABOUT HOW THE
[ct=2838.302] GIANTS ARE MOVING A LOT OF
[ct=2841.843] PLAYERS ON AND OFF THE FIELD AND
[ct=2843.427] OBVIOUSLY MIKE ZIMMER, WITH A
[ct=2844.941] NEW SCHEME, IS
[ct=2846.046] COMMUNICATE AND ADJUST BACK AND
[ct=2846.046] FORTH.
[ct=2850.239] THAT TIME, ONE GUY NOT ABLE TO
[ct=2852.996] THE FIELD.
[ct=2858.536] AL: SIX PENALTIES, 50 YARDS
[ct=2858.536] AGAINST DALLAS TO THIS POINT.
[ct=2862.610] 3:30 UNTIL THE HALF, SECOND DOWN
[ct=2862.610] AND 3.
[ct=2864.052] THE RIGHT SIDE.
[ct=2868.269] INTO TRAFFIC IS SINGLETARY.
[ct=2870.791] THIRD AND SHORT.
[ct=2877.083] KIRK: I THINK THIS DEFENSE HAS
[ct=2880.098] HEARD ENOUGH ABOUT HOW THEY ARE
[ct=2881.505] THE WEAKNESS OF THIS FOOTBALL
[ct=2883.625] TEAM, AT LEAST TONIGHT, THEY
[ct=2885.331] HAVE REALLY SHOWN UP UP FRONT
[ct=2888.195] AND DONE A MUCH BETTER JOB IN
[ct=2888.195] THE INTERIOR.
[ct=2890.453] THE BIGGEST THING YOU CAN SAY IS
[ct=2892.077] THEY ARE KEEPING THESE
[ct=2895.682] LINEBACKERS FREE, ESPECIALLY 50,
[ct=2897.351] ERIC KENDRICKS, THE VETERAN.
[ct=2898.785] AL: OVERSHOWN IS BACK IN.
[ct=2901.357] THIRD DOWN AND 3.
[ct=2904.233] JONES WILL KEEP, JONES WILL GET
[ct=2905.553] THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2907.674] DANIEL JONES TAKES IT TO THE
[ct=2909.606] 21-YARD LINE.
[ct=2910.941] STOP BY BOOTH.
[ct=2913.577] FIRST DOWN FOR THE GIANTS.
[ct=2916.371] THIS DRIVE HAS CONSUMED 6:30.
[ct=2920.121] THE NEXT PLAY WILL BE THE 12TH
[ct=2921.418] OF THE DRIVE.
[ct=2922.894] KIRK: GOOD JOB OF READING THAT.
[ct=2925.434] PICKS UP A BLOCK FROM THE ROOKIE
[ct=2926.844] THEO JOHNSON.
[ct=2929.678] DANIEL JONES, THEY WANT HIM TO
[ct=2932.348] BE EFFICIENT AND PLAY SMART.
[ct=2932.348] ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO SLOW DO
[ct=2933.820] PARSONS.
[ct=2936.617] THE ZONE READ LOOK MAKES HIM
[ct=2937.496] HESITANT.
[ct=2944.569] AL: OFF THE FAKE AGAIN TO THE
[ct=2946.036] OUTSIDE.
[ct=2947.489] DROPPING IT.
[ct=2950.040] FLAG IS THROWN.
[ct=2952.888] ROBINSON DROPPED IT.
[ct=2956.718] FOR THE MOMENT, TAKING IT ALL
[ct=2958.164] THE WAY DOWN THE FIELD WAS MALIK
[ct=2958.164] HOOKER.
[ct=2963.404] THE FLAG BACK AT THE 18-YARD
[ct=2966.087] EVERYONE WILL COME BACK IN THAT
[ct=2967.314] DIRECTION.
[ct=2970.104] THAT WILL ALSO TAKE US TO THE
[ct=2971.459] TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=2977.816] I AM AFRAID TO GET THE CALL.
[ct=2983.735] KIRK: WE HAVE A MAN DOWNFIELD
[ct=2985.039] FOR THE GIANTS.
[ct=2987.522] THAT IS WHAT THE FLAG WILL BE.
[ct=2990.313] THE QUESTION IS WILL IT BE
[ct=2990.313] INCOMPLETE?
[ct=2994.249] ASSISTANTS, THE PASS WAS
[ct=2999.722] HOWEVER, WE HAVE AN INELIGIBLE
[ct=3001.141] PLAYER DOWNFIELD, OFFENSE,
[ct=3002.272] NUMBER 72.
[ct=3006.247] AL: JERMAINE ELUEMUNOR.
[ct=3010.551] KIRK: I WAS JUST GOING TO BRAG
[ct=3010.551] ON WHAT A TIME TO CALL THAT.
[ct=3014.470] YOU BOOT AND GET IT OUT THERE
[ct=3015.182] AND DALLAS' EYES
[ct=3019.726] REFEREE: PLEASE RESET THE CLOCK
[ct=3020.751] TO 2:09.
[ct=3025.179] KIRK: HE HAD A LOT OF ROOM TO GO
[ct=3026.490] AROUND THE CORNER IF HE COULD
[ct=3026.490] SECURE IT.
[ct=3030.510] HERE IS THE MAN DOWNFIELD,
[ct=3032.939] HE IS WAY DOWN FIELD.
[ct=3036.989] AL: DID NOT TAKE THAT THIRD
[ct=3038.326] STEP, AS THE SAYING GOES.
[ct=3040.905] THEY PUT TIME BACK ON THE CLOCK.
[ct=3045.959] THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING HAS NOT
[ct=3045.959] OCCURRED.
[ct=3047.400] WE HAVE ANOTHER FLAG.
[ct=3052.701] IT LOOKS LIKE JUNE 14, OTHERWISE
[ct=3052.701] KNOWN AS FLAG DAY.
[ct=3057.976] CLAY MARTIN LOOKS LIKE A REFE
[ct=3059.455] OUT OF CENTRAL CASTING.
[ct=3060.700] KIRK: [LAUGHTER]
[ct=3063.557] HE LOOKS LIKE A YOUNG TERRY
[ct=3064.555] MCCAULEY OUT THERE.
[ct=3067.513] TERRY WAS ALWAYS TIGHT IN THE
[ct=3071.769] UNI, BACK IN HIS HEYDAY.
[ct=3075.575] AL: AFTER ALL THAT, PLAY CLOCK
[ct=3077.052] GETS RESET AT 25.
[ct=3079.640] GIANTS HAVE CONTROLLED THE
[ct=3082.159] QUARTER BUT STILL TRAIL BY
[ct=3082.159] EIGHT.
[ct=3085.021] FIRST AND 15 NOW.
[ct=3093.812] GOING TO BE SECOND AND 13 AND
[ct=3093.812] THAT WILL TAKE US
[ct=3108.624] AL: AL: THERE IS OUR GANG
[ct=3112.544] WORKING ON THE SHOW.
[ct=3115.261] WATER OUR SLEEP DEPOSIT.
[ct=3128.401] TACKLE MADE IMMEDIATELY COMING
[ct=3131.134] UP WILL BE THE 14TH PLAY
[ct=3140.449] FIVE OF EIGHT, DOING A GOOD JOB
[ct=3140.449] PROTECTING DANIEL JONES.
[ct=3151.650] TRYING TO MOVE AROUND, -- MOVE
[ct=3152.956] NABERS AROUND.
[ct=3157.979] AL: ROBINSON AND THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=3160.239] THERE IS A DEFENSIVE ALERT.
[ct=3164.292] AND TWO MORE SLIDES.
[ct=3168.573] KIRK: HE DID THREE HARD ACCOUNTS
[ct=3168.573] TO TRY TO PULL HIM OFF.
[ct=3172.596] THE THIRD WAS THE CHARM.
[ct=3181.691] >> NEUTRAL ZONE INFRACTION.
[ct=3182.873] DEFENSE, NUMBER 11.
[ct=3182.873] THIRD DOWN.
[ct=3187.138] AL: SOMEWHERE AARON RODGERS IS
[ct=3188.544] WATCHING THIS AND
[ct=3192.594] APPRECIATING THE THIRD DOWN FROM
[ct=3193.989] DANIEL JONES.
[ct=3205.597] YOU HAVE JUST ENOUGH HAND
[ct=3206.791] MOVEMENT ON TOP OF IT.
[ct=3209.481] KIRK: I THINK THAT MOTION, ALSO
[ct=3210.845] CAUGHT THEIR EYES A LITTLE BIT.
[ct=3214.084] AL: NOW WHAT?
[ct=3230.140] >> THE GIANTS HAVE ELECTED TO
[ct=3232.834] RUN THE CLOCK TO AVOID.
[ct=3234.189] THE COWBOYS WILL CALL A TIMEOUT.
[ct=3236.690] TIMEOUT ON THE FIELD.
[ct=3243.498] DANIEL JONES AND THE EFFICIENCY
[ct=3243.498] HE HAS PLAYED WITH TONIGHT.
[ct=3246.325] REALLY NICE THINGS.
[ct=3249.844] FINALLY OPEN RECEIVER, AND THAT
[ct=3251.687] IS GREAT OVER THE TOP OF
[ct=3255.480] HE HAS MOVED, HE HAS USED HIS
[ct=3258.184] HE IS MOVING THE BALL AROUND.
[ct=3260.669] IT IS NOT JUST NABERS.
[ct=3261.781] ROBINSON HAS HAD OPPORTUNITIES.
[ct=3263.264] HE'S INVOLVED IN THE RUN GAME.
[ct=3266.034] HE'S DOING A GOOD JOB OF MEANING
[ct=3267.009] IN COMMAND OF WHAT T
[ct=3268.669] TRYING TO EXECUTE.
[ct=3272.867] AL: IF YOU GET PICKED IN THE
[ct=3274.154] FIRST-ROUND, YOU ARE NUMBER
[ct=3275.417] YOU HAVE A FRANCHISE QUARTERBACK
[ct=3277.964] WHO RETIRES IN ELI MANNING, HAVE
[ct=3280.594] THE HISTORY OF GREAT CORNERBACKS
[ct=3280.594] HERE IN NEW YORK.
[ct=3284.655] IT IS LIKE THE SAGA CONTINUES.
[ct=3284.655] IS HE OR IS HE NOT OUR GUY?
[ct=3288.665] I TELL YOU WHAT, HE WILL ENJOY
[ct=3291.321] WATCHING HARD KNOCKS, TALKING
[ct=3292.768] ABOUT THE SAME THING, TALKING
[ct=3292.768] ABOUT TRADING UP.
[ct=3295.622] THIRD DOWN AND 4 AFTER THAT
[ct=3298.193] TIMEOUT TAKEN BY THE COWBOYS
[ct=3299.648] AVOID A RUNOFF.
[ct=3301.078] THEY WILL TRY TO GET THE BALL
[ct=3304.973] GETS SACKED, AND HE FLAGGED HIS
[ct=3306.425] THROW.
[ct=3311.416] A HOLD AGAINST THE GIANTS.
[ct=3315.333] >> OFFENSE, NUMBER 72, PENALTIE
[ct=3316.676] DECLINED.
[ct=3316.676] FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=3320.444] KIRK: KEEP WAITING FOR PARSONS
[ct=3320.444] ON THESE THIRD DOWNS.
[ct=3323.427] HE JUST WENT RIGHT THROUGH HIM.
[ct=3326.316] LOOK AT THIS, POWER, HE GETS
[ct=3328.904] DOWN, LOOK AT THAT PUSH, THE
[ct=3330.284] BAND, THE ATHLETIC ABILITY, THE
[ct=3330.284] POWER.
[ct=3333.895] PARSONS CAME UP RIGHT AWAY,
[ct=3333.895] LOOKING AT THE
[ct=3335.624] OUT HERE.
[ct=3336.944] THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE.
[ct=3340.675] AL: HE HAS BEEN ON THIS TEAM FOR
[ct=3340.675] DECADES, JOHN.
[ct=3343.496] HEAD OF THE GROUP RIGHT NOW.
[ct=3348.851] 38 YARD FIELD GOAL, AND THAT IS
[ct=3348.851] GOOD.
[ct=3351.376] AND THEY SHOULD
[ct=3352.819] RECORDING.
[ct=3354.210] THE FLAG IS DOWN.
[ct=3359.698] KIRK: OFFSIDES ON DALLAS.
[ct=3362.305] AL: WELL, IT WAS.
[ct=3364.879] FOURTH AND 8.
[ct=3367.620] >> OFFSIDE.
[ct=3370.169] DALLAS, NUMBER 30.
[ct=3371.704] PENALTIES DECLINED.
[ct=3376.719] THE COWBOYS ARE GOING TO GET
[ct=3376.719] THE BALL.
[ct=3380.457] AND THEY WILL HAVE TWO TIMEOUTS.
[ct=3382.743] MAKE IT ONE.
[ct=3383.883] ONE TIMEOUT AT THEIR DISPOSAL.
[ct=3388.585] AND THEY HAVE BRANDON AUBREY AS
[ct=3389.110] THEIR FIELD KICKER.
[ct=3392.996] KIRK: GET IT TO YOUR OWN 45.
[ct=3405.774] AL: HIS RANGE.
[ct=3407.412] AND THROUGH THE END ZONE.
[ct=3410.207] KIRK: WE HAVE TALKED A LOT ABOUT
[ct=3415.455] MICHAEL PARSONS, AND LAWRENCE
[ct=3416.814] HAS BEEN DOUBLE-TEAMED, SEVEN OF
[ct=3419.458] NINE HIS LAST RUSH ATTEMPTS, AND
[ct=3422.359] YOU GET FOUR HANDS ON IT, AND
[ct=3423.413] THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO
[ct=3424.936] AGAINST THE BEST NOSE GUARD IN
[ct=3425.145] NFL.
[ct=3427.571] HE MAKES PLAYS LIKE THIS AGAINST
[ct=3430.212] THE RUN, COMES DOWN A BIG STEP
[ct=3431.427] PLAY, AND IF HE ISN'T
[ct=3432.129] DOUBLE-TEAMED, THE BALL IS
[ct=3432.610] GETTING OUT IN A HURRY.
[ct=3436.379] THEY JUST -- THEY JUST KIND OF
[ct=3438.544] BAITED HIM TOWARDS DAX PRESCOTT
[ct=3439.304] -- DAK PRESCOTT.
[ct=3442.963] AL: FAST CAUGHT, OVER THE
[ct=3443.818] MIDDLE, LOOKING FOR THE
[ct=3446.493] CAN HE GET OUT OF BOUNDS?
[ct=3447.832] YES, HE CAN.
[ct=3454.450] PICKED UP NINE, SO PRESCOTT IS
[ct=3457.146] 12 OF 13, AND LAMB HAS
[ct=3458.448] SIX ON SIX TARGETS.
[ct=3462.702] KIRK: DAK PRESCOTT THINKING THE
[ct=3463.260] FIELD GOAL RANGE, ONE TIMEOUT.
[ct=3465.103] THE GIANTS TRY TO KEEP
[ct=3467.724] EVERYTHING IN FRONT OF THEM, TWO
[ct=3469.518] SAFETIES BACK, FOCUSED ON TRYING
[ct=3470.270] TO KEEP NUMBER 88 AWAY FROM
[ct=3470.759] MAKING A BIG PLAY.
[ct=3473.181] AL: IS ONLY
[ct=3477.136] HE'S COMPLETED 12 IN A ROW.
[ct=3478.650] MAKE THAT A LUCKY 13 AS JAKE
[ct=3479.962] FERGUSON MAKES THE CATCH FOR A
[ct=3480.463] VERY SHORT GAME.
[ct=3484.010] PRESCOTT RINGS HIM UP TO THE
[ct=3484.233] LINE QUICKLY.
[ct=3489.272] 40 SECONDS TO HALFTIME.
[ct=3491.917] KIRK: ALL KIDDING ASIDE, THEY
[ct=3494.048] ARE FIVE YARDS AWAY FROM HAVING
[ct=3494.511] A SHOT WITHIN HIS RANGE.
[ct=3496.868] AL: NOW THEY ARE A LOT FARTHER.
[ct=3504.457] THAT IS THIBODEAU -- THAT IS
[ct=3513.505] THIBODEAUX.
[ct=3516.170] TIMEOUT TAKEN, AND WE ARE BACK
[ct=3516.393] IN 30 SECONDS.
[ct=3554.669] AL: I ALWAYS THOUGHT SHERMAN WAS
[ct=3554.896] A CAVIAR GUY.
[ct=3559.966] SECOND AND 18.
[ct=3562.857] PRESCOTT TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=3565.318] THEY HAVE TO USE THE SIDELINE
[ct=3565.578] HERE.
[ct=3569.489] BECAUSE THEY ARE OUT OF
[ct=3569.799] TIMEOUTS.
[ct=3572.158] KIRK: LET'S GO BACK TO THE
[ct=3572.616] PREVIOUS PLAY.
[ct=3574.631] THIBODEAUX AGAINST THE ROOKIE
[ct=3575.379] RATE HE'S LINED UP TO THE
[ct=3577.745] OUTSIDE AND TO GO OUTSIDE.
[ct=3581.249] BUT, INSTEAD, THE POWER RUSHED
[ct=3583.918] TO THE INSIDE, AND HE GETS HOME.
[ct=3587.872] AL: THIRD AND 12.
[ct=3589.220] THIBODEAUX CAME ACROSS THE LINE.
[ct=3591.838] YOU HAVE A FREE PLAY, ANOTHER
[ct=3595.821] PLAY, TWO MORE FLAGS IN THE
[ct=3599.016] HOLBORN MAIDS THE CATCH, 29 YARD
[ct=3602.111] LINE, AND ANY NUMBER OF CALLS
[ct=3602.613] COMING YOUR WAY.
[ct=3606.580] KIRK: YOU HAVE OFFSIDES, FREE
[ct=3607.340] PLAY AND THEN A HOLD BY THE LEFT
[ct=3610.061] TACKLE, THE ROOKIE.
[ct=3611.837] HE TACKLED THIBODEAUX THAT TIME.
[ct=3613.907] >> FOULS BY BOTH TEAMS ON THE
[ct=3615.812] PLAY.
[ct=3617.174] DEFENSE, NUMBER FIVE.
[ct=3618.878] HOLDING.
[ct=3620.348] OFFENSE, NUMBER 60, THOSE
[ct=3621.973] PENALTIES OFFSET, PREVIOUS
[ct=3623.819] REPLAY THE DOWN.
[ct=3626.483] KIRK: THAT TAKES THEIR SHOT
[ct=3626.712] AWAIT OF A FIELD GOAL.
[ct=3628.441] HERE HE IS JUMPING OFFSIDES.
[ct=3632.058] HE IS A ROOKIE AND WILL BE FINE
[ct=3635.759] DOWN THE ROAD, BUT ONCE HE ENDS
[ct=3636.274] UP JUMPING OFFSIDES, HE KEEPS
[ct=3639.664] HUSTLING TO MAKE A PLAY, AND HE
[ct=3641.183] OBVIOUSLY HAS TO END UP TRIED TO
[ct=3641.382] KEEP THEM AWAY FROM THE
[ct=3641.886] CORNERBACK.
[ct=3644.071] AL: THIBODEAUX COMES OFF THE
[ct=3644.870] FIELD FOR THE MOMENT.
[ct=3650.941] FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH, THE GIANTS
[ct=3654.922] HAVE TWO THAT ARE PROBABLY MOOT
[ct=3655.471] AT THIS POINT.
[ct=3659.910] KIRK: TWO OFFICIALS TALKING, THE
[ct=3661.745] MICROCOSM STILL ON THE GROUND AT
[ct=3661.978] THE 35 YARD LINE.
[ct=3664.173] THERE IS A LOT OF CLEANUP.
[ct=3666.031] THOSE ARE A LOT OF FLAGS.
[ct=3669.463] >> FOULED I THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=3671.199] HOLDER, NO TIMEOUT IN REGARDS TO
[ct=3675.816] KIRK: KEEP THIS IN MIND, 20
[ct=3678.126] SECONDS, IF THEY GET TACKLED,
[ct=3679.390] OBVIOUSLY IN BOUNDS, THEY WILL
[ct=3681.267] HAVE TO SPREAD OUT TO HAVE A
[ct=3682.589] CHANCE AT A FIELD GOAL THIS
[ct=3685.231] THIRD DOWN UNLESS THEY ARE ABLE
[ct=3685.751] TO PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN AND
[ct=3686.013] SPOT THE BALL.
[ct=3687.890] AL: EXACTLY.
[ct=3692.099] SO THERE IS AUBREY, WHO IS
[ct=3692.604] LIVING IN ANOTHER WORLD RIGHT
[ct=3693.422] NOW.
[ct=3699.842] ALMOST NEVER MISSES, 65 YARD OR
[ct=3699.842] LAST WEEK.
[ct=3704.073] HE HAS A SHOT AND A LONG ONE
[ct=3704.351] NEXT.
[ct=3705.404] THIRD AND 12.
[ct=3710.766] FOUR MAN RUSH.
[ct=3715.748] TO THE OUTSIDE, THOUGH,
[ct=3718.658] BRANDON IS THE INTENDED
[ct=3720.257] RECEIVER, SO WITH 14 SECONDS
[ct=3721.087] NOW, FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=3725.253] IN COMES BRYAN ANGER TO PUNT.
[ct=3728.605] KIRK: A BIG STOP FOR THE GIANTS
[ct=3730.757] THEY CAUGHT A BREAK WITH THE
[ct=3732.732] HOLDING CALL BECAUSE DALLAS
[ct=3733.496] WOULD HAVE HAD A SHOT AT A FIELD
[ct=3735.904] GOAL BUT WITH THE GIANTS
[ct=3737.247] DEFERRING THE FIRST HALF, THEY
[ct=3739.623] GET THE FIELD GOAL, THE STOP,
[ct=3740.602] DOWN FIVE AND THEN THE BALL TO
[ct=3741.948] START THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=3747.271] AL: JONES WAS 13 OF 15 IN THE
[ct=3752.830] HALF, PRESCOTT 14 OF 16 AT 164.
[ct=3757.876] YOU ARE KIDDING.
[ct=3759.255] >> FALSE START.
[ct=3761.078] OFFENSE, NUMBER 30.
[ct=3762.401] FIVE YARD PENALTY.
[ct=3768.534] KIRK: IS THAT THE EIGHTH PENALTY
[ct=3768.534] NOW?
[ct=3771.136] AL: NO, THE 147TH.
[ct=3776.183] WHAT WAS THAT SHOT OF YOU AND
[ct=3779.539] FRANK GIFFORD, 1986, YOU CALLED
[ct=3780.909] A BUNCH OF MONDAY NIGHT,
[ct=3783.546] THURSDAY NIGHT, SUNDAY NIGHT, IS
[ct=3784.128] THIS A WORLD RECORD FOR YOU THE
[ct=3784.409] FIRST HALF?
[ct=3787.636] AL: ABSOLUTELY.
[ct=3788.175] WITHOUT QUESTION.
[ct=3793.424] GOING TO NEED SOME NEW FLAGS TO
[ct=3794.558] THROW IN THE SECOND HALF BECAUSE
[ct=3794.769] THESE ARE FILTHY.
[ct=3803.269] THE KICK BOUNCED INSIDE THE
[ct=3804.268] THERE IS ANOTHER FLAG.
[ct=3805.823] IN FACT, THERE ARE TWO.
[ct=3813.271] WE WOULD NOT LIE TO YOU.
[ct=3825.405] OH YEAH.
[ct=3830.207] WE ARE KIND OF FEELING THE SAME
[ct=3830.761] WAY RIGHT NOW.
[ct=3834.947] WITH THE SCORE.
[ct=3838.931] >> DALLAS, NUMBERN
[ct=3841.777] TO AMAZON TO ORDER NEW FLAGS.
[ct=3844.264] KIRK: IT IS A QUICK HALFTIME.
[ct=3846.853] AL: JEREMY JONES AND STEVEN
[ct=3848.419] JONES.
[ct=3851.087] THE TEAM IS AT LEAST IN THE GAME
[ct=3853.028] AS THEY HAVE NOT BEEN THE LAST
[ct=3853.944] TWO HALF TIMES, AND THAT TAKES
[ct=3854.471] US TO THE BREAK.
[ct=3855.515] THAT IS THE END OF THE FIRST
[ct=3855.846] HALF.
[ct=3859.249] WEEK, DALLAS LEADS NEW
[ct=3862.746] YORK 14-9 AT THE HALF, THANKS TO
[ct=3862.967] DAK PREER ONE
[ct=3864.415] HAS TURNED THE BALL OVER, I
[ct=3865.352] DON'T WANT TO JINX THEM, BUT
[ct=3867.731] THEY HAVE BEEN EFFICIENT, WHICH
[ct=3868.274] GUY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO PLAY
[ct=3870.498] THAT WAY, AND SOMEONE
[ct=3871.809] EVENTUALLY, ONE OF THESE
[ct=3873.190] DEFENSES WILL CREATE THAT
[ct=3874.469] TURNOVER AND WIN A FOOTBALL
[ct=3874.972] GAME.
[ct=3878.733] AL: DROPPED GREAT PICKED UP,
[ct=3883.732] THIS IS TRACY, AND HE GETS
[ct=3886.460] SMACKED, COMES OUT, AND THAT IS
[ct=3889.085] THE WAY THE THIRD QUARTER
[ct=3890.653] STARTS.
[ct=3894.655] KAYLEE: COACH, YOUR OFFENSE
[ct=3896.395] LOOKED SHARP, BUT WITH THOSE
[ct=3896.916] NINE ACCEPTED PENALTIES, HOW DO
[ct=3897.374] YOU FIX THAT?
[ct=3899.274] >> TOO MANY PENALTIES.
[ct=3900.711] WE HAVE TO CLEAN THAT UP.
[ct=3904.715] WE'VE HAD BIG PLAY OPPORTUNITIES
[ct=3905.260] SLIP THROUGH OUR FINGERS SO WE
[ct=3906.036] NEED TO JUMP ON THEM THE SECOND
[ct=3908.959] KAYLEE: YOUR RUN DEFENSE
[ct=3909.765] IMPROVED THE PAST TWO GAMES,
[ct=3910.172] WHAT CHANGED?
[ct=3913.042] >> WE ARE JUST FOCUSED ON THE
[ct=3915.467] NEXT GAME, SO OUR GUYS KNEW IT
[ct=3917.932] WAS GOING TO BE A DIVISION GAME,
[ct=3918.173] GREAT ENVIRONMENT SO WE HAVE TO
[ct=3918.450] KEEP PLAYING.
[ct=3923.119] AL: SO MIKE MCCARTHY, MEANWHILE,
[ct=3927.385] HE RECOVERED THE GIANTS, AND
[ct=3928.645] STARTING ON THE GROUND, AND THAT
[ct=3930.483] DEFENSE, WHICH HAS ALLOWED LESS
[ct=3932.014] THAN TWO YARDS PER CARRY DOES IT
[ct=3932.301] AGAIN HERE.
[ct=3937.134] SINGLETARY FOR A LOSS OF THREE.
[ct=3939.878] KIRK: LET'S LOOK AT THAT KICKOFF
[ct=3940.426] RETURN BECAUSE IT HAPPENED
[ct=3940.649] QUICKLY.
[ct=3945.365] ON THE RIGHT, HE HAS BEEN
[ct=3946.617] EVERYWHERE ON THIS FIELD, NOT
[ct=3948.450] ONLY PLAYING GREAT DEFENSE BUT
[ct=3949.252] JUST THROWING HIS BODY IN THERE
[ct=3952.330] TO GET THAT BALL OUT, AND THE
[ct=3954.132] GIANTS ARE VERY FORTUNATE THAT
[ct=3954.725] HE IS ABLE TO RECOVER THAT.
[ct=3958.603] AL: HE SAVED THE DAY, SECOND
[ct=3961.664] DOWN AND 13 NOW.
[ct=3969.658] SINGLETARY IN MOTION TO THE
[ct=3972.273] JONES ASKED THAT WAY AND THEN
[ct=3974.657] THE OTHER WAY, AND THAT PASS UP
[ct=3976.423] AT THE 34 YARD LINE TO DARIUS
[ct=3977.320] SLAYTON.
[ct=3978.564] HE HOLDS THAT BABY IN FOR THE
[ct=3981.934] KIRK: REALLY GOOD PATIENTS BY
[ct=3984.921] THIS OFFENSIVE LINE IS DOING A
[ct=3985.823] NICE JOB OF TAKING CARE OF HIM
[ct=3986.084] AGAIN.
[ct=3988.969] WATCH HIM WORK TO THE LEFT.
[ct=3990.259] I THOUGHT HE MIGHT GO HERE BUT
[ct=3992.722] INSTEAD HE WAITS FOR THE CROSSER
[ct=3994.042] AND HE ENDS UP GOING DOWNFIELD A
[ct=3994.806] LITTLE FURTHER TO BE ABLE TO
[ct=3995.336] PICK UP THAT FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3999.535] AL: EACH CORNERBACK IS 14 OF 16.
[ct=4004.045] JONES STEPS UP TO THE POCKET.
[ct=4006.804] TO THE OUTSIDE HE GOES, AND THAT
[ct=4007.308] WILL BE DARIUS SLAYTON RIGHT
[ct=4007.556] THERE.
[ct=4011.746] PICKING UP THE FIRST AGAIN.
[ct=4014.611] AND THE GIANTS ON THE MOVE.
[ct=4017.499] KIRK: DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE
[ct=4019.605] HEAD COACH TAKING OVER THOSE
[ct=4020.329] PLAYCALLING DUTIES THIS YEAR.
[ct=4023.813] THEY HAVE NOT BEEN AS AGGRESSIVE
[ct=4025.523] AS I THINK HE WOULD LIKE TO BE.
[ct=4027.812] I THINK A LOT OF THAT IS
[ct=4028.335] PREDICATED UPON HOW THE FLOW OF
[ct=4030.563] THE GAME IS GOING AND HOW YOUR
[ct=4030.992] OWN DEFENSE IS PLAYING.
[ct=4034.780] BUT HERE MAKING ADJUSTMENTS AND
[ct=4035.338] THEY HAVE COME OUT GIVING THE
[ct=4037.124] BALL TO DANIEL JONES.
[ct=4040.100] AL: NABERS IS THE MAN IN MOTION.
[ct=4044.062] THE PASS CAUGHT BY ROBINSON, BIG
[ct=4045.352] FIRST HALF, STARTS WITH AN EIGHT
[ct=4045.613] YARD PICKUP HERE.
[ct=4049.259] GETS THE BALL TO DALLAS
[ct=4051.019] TERRITORY FOR SECOND DOWN AND 2.
[ct=4053.686] KIRK: ONE OF THE ADJUSTMENTS HE
[ct=4054.661] MADE, ALL WEEK HE TALKED ABOUT
[ct=4054.885] HOW WE’
[ct=4055.435] HOW WE'VE BEEN WATCHING DALLAS.
[ct=4059.629] WORST IN THE NFL AFTER THREE
[ct=4059.869] WEEKS.
[ct=4060.395] WE HAVE TO WIN THE LINE OF
[ct=4062.739] WE HAVE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL WITH
[ct=4065.942] THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RUN
[ct=4066.733] THE FOOTBALL, SO NOW HE IS
[ct=4067.692] SAYING, THAT’
[ct=4068.261] SAYING, THAT'S GET THE BALL OUT
[ct=4071.502] QUICK AND TRY TO PROTECT THE
[ct=4071.502] QUARTERBACK AND
[ct=4072.865] ADVANTAGE OF THE WEAPONS WE HAVE
[ct=4073.085] ON THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=4079.367] AL: SECOND AND 2.
[ct=4082.424] SHOULD HAVE THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4085.137] THERE GOES DEVIN SINGLETARY.
[ct=4088.337] KIRK: ON THAT RIGHT SIDE, WE
[ct=4089.155] KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE LINE.
[ct=4092.475] THE RIGHT SIDE, BOTH FROM THE
[ct=4097.335] RAIDERS, THEY CAME OVER AND,
[ct=4100.004] IRONICALLY, YOU ALSO HAVE THE
[ct=4100.004] RAIDERS OFFENSIVE LINE COACH YOU
[ct=4100.241] CAME OVER.
[ct=4102.675] THERE IS SOME CONTINUITY ON THE
[ct=4103.949] RIGHT SIDE AND REALLY ON THE
[ct=4106.007] ENTIRE OFFENSIVE LINE, YOU WOULD
[ct=4109.081] THINK, WHEN YOU HAVE THREE NEW
[ct=4111.198] PIECES EARLY IN SEPTEMBER, YOU
[ct=4111.382] WILL HAVE TO WORK AND FIND A
[ct=4115.118] WITH THE LINE COACH COMING OVER
[ct=4116.962] FROM LAS VEGAS, THE RIGHT SIDE
[ct=4118.073] BOTH FROM VEGAS, THERE IS BUILT
[ct=4118.606] IN CONTINUITY.
[ct=4121.653] AL: THAT WAS A MAJOR PRIORITY IN
[ct=4123.437] THE OFF-SEASON, THAT OFFENSIVE
[ct=4123.655] LINE WAS A MESS LAST YEAR.
[ct=4130.079] TRACY TAKES THE PASS, AND HE
[ct=4130.079] PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN AND
[ct=4132.705] STAYS INBOUND.
[ct=4135.752] 25 YARD LINE HE GOES.
[ct=4144.180] ALREADY FOUR FIRST DOWNS FOR THE
[ct=4144.415] GIANTS ON THIS DRIVE.
[ct=4147.342] KIRK: AGAIN, GOOD FLOW, GOOD
[ct=4148.640] RHYTHM, GREAT EXECUTION.
[ct=4152.623] WE HAVE SEEN SINGLETARY, THAT
[ct=4153.986] FORMER WIDE RECEIVER IN COLLEGE,
[ct=4156.635] CAME OUT OF PERDUE, HE WAS IN
[ct=4158.162] IOWA AS A RECEIVER, VERY
[ct=4160.036] COMFORTABLE WITH THE BALL IN HIS
[ct=4160.562] HANDS GETTING OUT TO THE
[ct=4162.157] PERIMETER AND HOW ABOUT THOSE
[ct=4163.890] LINEMEN COMING OVER FROM LAS
[ct=4166.083] VEGAS, GETTING OUT IN FRONT AND
[ct=4166.083] OPENING THAT THING UP?
[ct=4174.047] AL: GOOD PROTECTION.
[ct=4174.993] GOOD PASS.
[ct=4176.724] TO THE 10.
[ct=4184.998] NABERS POOLS ONE AND AGAIN.
[ct=4185.492] SIX CATCHES TONIGHT ON EIGHT
[ct=4187.150] TARGETS FOR 74 YARDS.
[ct=4190.060] KIRK: ISN'T IT AMAZING WHAT
[ct=4191.655] DANIEL JONES CAN DO WHEN HE HAS
[ct=4193.972] TIME TO THROW THE FOOTBALL AND
[ct=4194.186] HAS SOME WEAPONS TO THROW TO?
[ct=4197.162] NABERS SLIPS THROUGH THAT GAP,
[ct=4200.476] AND I TELL YOU, WHAT A JOB OF
[ct=4202.259] BEING PATIENT, WAITING FOR THE
[ct=4203.579] LINEBACKER 50.
[ct=4206.215] YOU CAN SEE HIM COMING DOWN AND
[ct=4207.573] HE OPENED UP JUST ENOUGH ROOM
[ct=4208.947] FOR THE SQUEEZE BEFORE NABERS
[ct=4210.886] GETS HIT.
[ct=4211.121] GREAT PLAY.
[ct=4215.526] AL: SPEAKING OF, THIS DRIVE AS
[ct=4218.685] JONES AVOIDS THE SACK AND THE
[ct=4220.051] THROWS INCOMPLETE, OUT OF
[ct=4222.155] PRESSURE PUT ON.
[ct=4225.394] WONDERING IF MANNERS COULD
[ct=4227.646] RECOVER THAT FUMBLE, COULD
[ct=4228.976] BEEN A DISASTROUS BEGINNING TO
[ct=4229.186] THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=4232.165] KIRK: THIS DALLAS DEFENSE BEING
[ct=4236.160] TESTED, DEMARCUS LAWRENCE, 90,
[ct=4237.452] TRYING TO GET PRESSURE.
[ct=4244.155] JUST MRISSES -- MISSES.
[ct=4249.426] DANIEL JONES, SIX FOOT 5, 230,
[ct=4249.426] PULLING AWAY FROM LAWRENCE.
[ct=4252.357] OPENING THINGS UP TO START THE
[ct=4252.596] SECOND HALF.
[ct=4254.122] SIX THROWS AND TWO RUNS.
[ct=4257.043] AL: LAWRENCE TO THE SIDELINE.
[ct=4260.528] OVER THE LEFT SIDE, PICKING UP
[ct=4260.528] THREE.
[ct=4265.441] MAKE IT THIRD DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=4269.325] KIRK: WE KNOW WHO HAS BEEN HIS
[ct=4269.608] TARGET.
[ct=4272.402] NABERS LAST WEEK HAD A COUPLE OF
[ct=4275.375] BIG PLAYS DOWN IN THIS AREA, AND
[ct=4276.680] WE HAVE A MAN DOWN.
[ct=4279.530] LOOKS LIKE THE COWBOYS.
[ct=4283.327] AL: YOU SAW LAWRENCE ALREADY ON
[ct=4285.376] LAWRENCE, WALKING IN TO THE
[ct=4285.703] LOCKER ROOM.
[ct=4290.203] JUST TO REMIND FANS WHERE NABERS
[ct=4293.686] IS AND THE BIG SCORES THAT HE
[ct=4297.172] HAD LAST WEEK.
[ct=4300.078] AL: OFF TO THE LEFT.
[ct=4305.147] PASS IS CAUGHT AND TAKING DOWN
[ct=4309.335] AT THE FOUR YARD LINE, ROBINSON,
[ct=4310.336] SO IT MAKES IT FOURTH DOWN AND
[ct=4311.904] GOAL.
[ct=4315.069] KIRK: SO THEY USE NABERS AS A
[ct=4318.063] DECOY, TRYING TO BE AHEAD OF IT
[ct=4321.237] HERE IS NABERS, HE IS GOING TO
[ct=4322.593] OCCUPY A COUPLE DEFENDERS.
[ct=4327.329] DIGGS, ALSO 13, TRY TO CREATE
[ct=4328.112] SPACE TO SEE IF ROBINSON CAN
[ct=4331.411] MAKE SOMEONE MISS, BUT 13 ALL
[ct=4331.988] OVER THIS FIELD MAKES A GOOD
[ct=4333.764] PLAY GETTING HIM OUT OF BOUNDS
[ct=4334.233] BEFORE THE END ZONE.
[ct=4338.846] AL: HE OF COURSE DOES NOT LIKE
[ct=4341.456] THE FIELD GOAL, BUT AS A FAMOUS
[ct=4344.864] COACH SAID A LONG TIME AGO,
[ct=4345.568] PRETTY SOON YOU ARE SITTING WITH
[ct=4345.568] IT.
[ct=4350.998] FIELD GOAL IS GOOD FROM 22, SO
[ct=4352.446] FOUR FIELD GOALS OFF THE FOOT OF
[ct=4353.045] JOSEPH.
[ct=4362.847] AL: MIKE HAS IN AROUND A LONG
[ct=4369.424] TIME, WON A SUPER BOWL IN 2010.
[ct=4372.167] HE AND AARON RODGERS TOGETHER.
[ct=4374.986] STARTED AS A TOLLBOOTH OPERATOR
[ct=4375.780] ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE.
[ct=4379.345] HAS HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS AS A
[ct=4379.645] COACH THE LAST THREE YEARS.
[ct=4383.055] MIKE HAS GONE 12-5, BUT THE
[ct=4385.165] BUGABOO FOR THE COWBOYS IS
[ct=4386.937] JANUARY.
[ct=4389.255] KIRK: IT'S ALL ABOUT THE
[ct=4389.440] POSTSEASON.
[ct=4392.675] LAST YEAR, THEY BECAME A TRENDY
[ct=4394.194] PICK, NOT JUST AWAY PRESCOTT WAS
[ct=4395.811] PLAYING, BUT PULLING AWAY FROM
[ct=4396.153] PEOPLE.
[ct=4398.435] IQ SAID, YOU GET TO THE
[ct=4403.306] POSTSEASON, AND PEOPLE QUICKLY
[ct=4403.517] FORGET ABOUT THE REGULAR SEASON.
[ct=4419.765] AL: JOSEPH, WHOALEX SMITH ALSO I
[ct=4420.383] CATEGORY.
[ct=4424.068] TWO GUYS WITH CAREERS BUT NOT A
[ct=4424.625] LOT OF SUCCESS BOTH SEASONS.
[ct=4426.982] OUTSIDE GOES THE FIRST PASS.
[ct=4429.930] THEY'RE GOING TO WHISTLE IT OUT
[ct=4429.930] OF BOUNDS.
[ct=4431.289] FERGUSON WAS ABLE TO GET BY.
[ct=4432.559] SECOND DOWN.
[ct=4436.547] KIRK: DAK PRESCOTT HAS HAD
[ct=4439.242] A GREAT NIGHT DURING THE
[ct=4439.714] FOOTBALL, 15-17 ON THE NIGHT
[ct=4443.176] AREA SOME HAVE BEEN QUICK
[ct=4443.428] PASSES.
[ct=4444.744] HE'S BEEN VERY PATIENT, GETS A
[ct=4446.875] NICE BLOCK, WORKS FROM THE
[ct=4448.717] RIGHT, COMES BACK TO THE LEFT TO
[ct=4453.218] LOOKING FOR HIS GUY, AND
[ct=4453.977] INSTEAD, IT IS TAKEN AWAY, ABLE
[ct=4456.874] TO EVENTUALLY CHECK THAT DOWN
[ct=4458.180] THE SCREEN AND MAKE A BIG PLAY
[ct=4460.867] A LOT OF BIG RESULTS.
[ct=4466.163] AL: FERGUSON TAKES THIS ONE, AND
[ct=4467.484] HE WILL PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4471.494] BURNS CAME IN FROM ONE SIDE AND
[ct=4472.879] THIBODEAUX FROM THE OTHER.
[ct=4474.775] WHO DO YOU THINK IS THE COWBOYS
[ct=4475.344] LEADING RUSHER TONIGHT?
[ct=4476.445] DO NOT LOOK.
[ct=4480.946] AL: YEAH, 10 YARDS.
[ct=4486.245] FOUR CARRIES FROM 8, 51 FOR SIX,
[ct=4487.672] ELLIOTT, ONE FOR FIVE.
[ct=4491.856] KIRK: DAK IT'S HITS AFTER THAT
[ct=4492.388] THROW, FLEXING HIS HAND.
[ct=4496.538] AL: HALFWAY MARK OF THE QUARTER.
[ct=4501.041] AND A DECENT RUN HERE AS HE
[ct=4503.123] TAKES THAT TO THE 50 YARD LINE.
[ct=4508.987] KIRK: JONES MAKING ADJUSTMENTS
[ct=4512.975] LET'S SEE WHAT THEY MIGHT WANT
[ct=4512.975] TO CONTINUE TO DO.
[ct=4514.279] GREAT OPENING DRIVE.
[ct=4516.889] WE TALKED IN OUR MEETING THIS
[ct=4518.455] MORNING, YOU ARE USED TO A
[ct=4524.266] PROFILE, HERE IS A GUY HE WAS A
[ct=4526.454] JOURNEYMAN, 50 YEAR, A BACKUP,
[ct=4526.678] HAD TO WAIT HIS TURN.
[ct=4530.464] AL: NICE RUN HERE.
[ct=4531.769] YOU THINK OF THE COWBOYS AND THE
[ct=4535.728] HISTORY OF THEM, HERSCHEL,
[ct=4541.221] WALKER, EMMITT SMITH, AND NOW,
[ct=4541.221] WHO?
[ct=4549.746] KIRK: AND HE WAS A BACKUP, THIRD
[ct=4551.290] GUY, AND A LOT OF TIME JUST ON
[ct=4551.833] SPECIAL TEAMS.
[ct=4553.057] JUST BY STICKING AROUND,
[ct=4555.060] IMPROVING AND GETTING BETTER.
[ct=4556.450] ONE THING FOR SURE, HE RUNS
[ct=4559.823] HARD, RUNS WITH A CHIP ON HIS
[ct=4560.434] SHOULDER AND GETS HIS HANDS ON
[ct=4563.329] AL: INTO THE OFFSIDE.
[ct=4566.200] AND ELLIOTT MAKES THE CATCH.
[ct=4568.858] ELLIOTT WITH NEW ENGLAND LAST
[ct=4569.101] YEAR.
[ct=4573.038] HE LED THE PATRIOTS AND
[ct=4573.300] RECEIVING YARDS.
[ct=4579.391] KIRK: GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO
[ct=4579.875] HIS DAYS IN OHIO STATE.
[ct=4583.365] HE CAN BREAK TACKLES AND HAVE
[ct=4584.679] SPEED AT THE SECOND AND THIRD
[ct=4586.239] LEVEL, BUT HE DOES HAVE NATURAL,
[ct=4586.753] SOFT HANDS.
[ct=4589.130] HERE HE IS MOTIONING OUT.
[ct=4594.642] AL: SECOND AND FIVE.
[ct=4595.087] CEEDEE LAMB COMES OUT OF THE
[ct=4597.250] BACK FIELD.
[ct=4598.829] HE CATCHES, HE SPENDS AND CANNOT
[ct=4599.413] GET THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4601.243] KIRK: HOW ABOUT THAT AS A CHANGE
[ct=4604.441] OF FOR MIKE MCCARTHY, GETTING
[ct=4607.611] MOTION OUT, AND YOU KEEP 88 AND
[ct=4610.761] THE BACKFIELD, CEEDEE LAMB, JUST
[ct=4612.239] TO GIVE THE GIANTS DEFENSE A
[ct=4613.874] DIFFERENT LOOK, EFFECTIVE
[ct=4615.920] COMMUNICATION, MAKE THEM TRY TO
[ct=4618.735] KEEP GUESSING WHERE CEEDEE LAMB
[ct=4618.735] MIGHT BE.
[ct=4620.248] NOW HE'S ON THE SPOT OFF TO THE
[ct=4621.594] LEFT.
[ct=4624.547] AL: THIRD AND 1.
[ct=4629.996] THE FULLBACK IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=4634.821] AND OUT OF HIS REACH, THE FLAG
[ct=4637.029] IS DOWN.
[ct=4637.464] AMAZINGLY, THE FIRST OF THE
[ct=4642.830] KIRK: THEY MAY GET THAT LEFT
[ct=4643.071] TACKLE, THE ROOKIE AGAIN.
[ct=4648.135] >> HOLDING, OFTEN.
[ct=4650.770] 10 YARD PENALTY.
[ct=4652.187] AL: --
[ct=4655.571] KIRK: WHEN YOU DOUBLE INSIDE,
[ct=4655.854] THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.
[ct=4658.754] HE HAS TREMENDOUS LENGTH AT 6’
[ct=4658.949] HE HAS TREMENDOUS LENGTH AT 6'7"
[ct=4660.763] , BUT GOING UP AGAINST
[ct=4663.042] THIBODEAUX, AS AN INSIDE MOVE,
[ct=4663.592] THEY GOT HIM AGAIN.
[ct=4667.324] HE KEEPS WORKING THE LEVERAGE TO
[ct=4668.244] THE OUTSIDE, AND YOU HAVE TO
[ct=4669.799] GIVE KATIE CREDIT FOR WORKING
[ct=4671.357] OUTSIDE AND THEN USING THAT
[ct=4673.886] POWER MOVE TO GO BACK INSIDE TO
[ct=4675.147] BEAT HIM, AND THAT IS ANOTHER
[ct=4676.923] TIME HE GOT A HOLDING CALL TO
[ct=4677.210] GET THAT MOVE.
[ct=4682.173] AL: 42 YARD LINE, THIRD DOWN AND
[ct=4682.481] 11.
[ct=4689.841] AND, YES, THEY ARE IN HIS RANGE.
[ct=4691.138] 61 YARDS FROM HERE.
[ct=4696.468] BACKFIRES, AND THAT IS
[ct=4705.943] AND IN COMES WHICH UNIT?
[ct=4708.831] KIRK: THEY ARE GOING TO OPT FOR
[ct=4710.356] BRANDON AUBREY.
[ct=4712.798] WHO HAS BECOME A TREMENDOUS
[ct=4713.933] WEAPON.
[ct=4716.631] NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
[ct=4718.321] IT IS EXCITING TO SEE IF THE OLD
[ct=4718.908] SCHOOL KICKER COME OUT.
[ct=4722.155] WITH ALL THESE INJURIES, HE HAS
[ct=4723.302] HAD TO STEP UP.
[ct=4725.937] YOU HAVE DUKE SHELLEY OUT THERE,
[ct=4725.937] HE HELD UP PRETTY WELL ON THE
[ct=4726.161] BACKEND.
[ct=4728.982] AL: 60 YARDER.
[ct=4740.025] "TULSA KING" AND BACK WE COME,
[ct=4742.321] POST MALONE WEARING HIS COWBOY
[ct=4742.675] GEAR.
[ct=4744.514] GOOD BUDDY OF AUBREY.
[ct=4749.955] ON THE FIELD BEFORE THE GAME,
[ct=4750.489] SIGNING TONS OF AUTOGRAPHS.
[ct=4753.629] YOU CAN LOOK AT HIM ON THE BIG
[ct=4753.629] BOARD.
[ct=4757.310] KIRK: THEY ALSO SAW THE YANKEES
[ct=4757.893] DEFEATING THE ORIOLES AND
[ct=4758.126] CLINCHING.
[ct=4759.692] AL: YEP.
[ct=4762.302] CLINCH THE DIVISION TITLE.
[ct=4765.453] AS GRAY RUNS IT BACK.
[ct=4768.601] OUT TO THE 32 YARD LINE.
[ct=4771.839] PENALTY IS DOWN, AND WE WILL GO
[ct=4775.381] TO KAYLEE AND A SECOND.
[ct=4777.186] LONG TIME SINCE WE'VE HEARD FROM
[ct=4779.623] SO IT IS ABOUT TIME.
[ct=4784.940] LAWRENCE IS BACK OUT, GETTING
[ct=4786.731] TAPED.
[ct=4795.009] WE HOPE YOU CAN GET BACK INTO
[ct=4795.336] THE GAME.
[ct=4799.532] ALL RIGHT, PICK IT UP.
[ct=4802.436] KAYLEE: YOU SAW BRANDON AUBREY
[ct=4805.065] NAIL THAT 60 YARD THE OLD SCHOOL
[ct=4807.478] BUT HE DOES NOT SPEND TIME
[ct=4807.687] PRACTICING KICKS FARTHER THAN
[ct=4807.935] THAT.
[ct=4810.635] HE FEELS CHANGES NEEDED TO GET
[ct=4812.870] EXTRA POWER AND HE DOES NOT WANT
[ct=4814.317] TO DISRUPT HIS NORMAL KICKING
[ct=4814.860] FORM.
[ct=4815.736] HE TOLD ME PREGAME THAT HE
[ct=4818.930] NORMALLY CAPS WARM UP KICKS AT
[ct=4820.026] 58 YARDS AND BY SEEING WHERE THE
[ct=4820.733] BALL HITS THE NET, HE KNOWS HOW
[ct=4823.442] MUCH DISTANCE HE HAS.
[ct=4825.504] HE TELLS ME HE IS GOOD FOR 68
[ct=4826.876] YARDER IN THESE CONDITIONS.
[ct=4829.980] AL: I DON'T DOUBT THAT, YOU
[ct=4832.187] WONDER HOW FAR HE CAN KICK ONE.
[ct=4833.524] JONES AND OUTSIDE.
[ct=4834.825] NABERS MAKES THE CATCH.
[ct=4838.004] SECOND DOWN FOR MALIK NABERS
[ct=4842.822] KIRK: CONTINUING HERE, THE
[ct=4845.516] SECOND DRIVE TO START THE SECOND
[ct=4849.078] THE OFFENSIVE STAFF, THE
[ct=4850.018] ADJUSTMENTS ARE EARLY AND OFTEN,
[ct=4853.777] THROWING THIS FOOTBALL AND
[ct=4854.327] TRUSTING DANIEL JONES TO MAKE
[ct=4857.741] GOOD DECISIONS, 20 OF 23 TONIGHT
[ct=4858.734] , 222 YARDS.
[ct=4868.265] JONES KEEPS.
[ct=4869.893] HE IS GOING TO GET WRAPPED UP,
[ct=4870.965] AND HE WILL GET TAKEN DOWN TO
[ct=4872.854] THE 30 YARD LINE BY MARSHAWN
[ct=4873.582] KNEELAND.
[ct=4876.230] SO THEY SACK HIM.
[ct=4881.704] KIRK: THIS IS HIS OWN READ THAT
[ct=4882.510] HE MISREADS, ONE OF THE FEW
[ct=4882.829] MISTAKES HE HAS MADE.
[ct=4885.579] HE IS READING THIS GUY RIGHT
[ct=4886.334] HERE, AND IF HE COLLAPSES ON THE
[ct=4890.090] BACK, HE GIVES HIM THAT LOOK AND
[ct=4891.032] COMES OUT AT THE QUARTERBACK, SO
[ct=4893.745] THEY NEEDED TO STAY ON THAT RIDE
[ct=4895.021] A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO GET A
[ct=4895.810] GOOD INDICATOR.
[ct=4898.996] THAT TIME KNEELAND, THE ROOKIE,
[ct=4898.996] GOT THE BEST OF IT THERE.
[ct=4905.243] AL: NABERS SHIFTING OVER TO THE
[ct=4905.243] RIGHT SIDE.
[ct=4911.029] PRESS COVERAGE.
[ct=4913.145] JONES THE OTHER WAY.
[ct=4914.423] THE TACKLE IS MADE THEREBY
[ct=4916.869] JOURDAN LEWIS ON ROBINSON, SO IT
[ct=4917.449] IS FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=4919.832] THE COWBOY DEFENSE DOING A
[ct=4920.596] REALLY GOOD JOB ON NABERS.
[ct=4925.670] IT IS NOT THAT ONE PASS WHEN
[ct=4928.321] THEY LOST HIM, THE 39 YARDS, BUT
[ct=4929.683] THE OTHER SIX CATCHES ARE GOOD
[ct=4929.882] FOR 40 YARDS.
[ct=4932.217] KIRK: THEY ARE MIXING UP
[ct=4932.647] COVERAGE, ROLLING TO HIM.
[ct=4935.032] THAT TIME THEY LEFT DIGGS ON AN
[ct=4936.364] ISLAND BECAUSE THEY TRUST HIM
[ct=4939.438] AND THE PLATE ON THE INSIDE, ONE
[ct=4941.287] OF THE GREAT LEADERS, JOURDAN
[ct=4941.287] LEWIS.
[ct=4942.592] NOWHERE TO GO AFTER THE CATCH.
[ct=4947.120] AL: GIANTS' FIRST PUNT.
[ct=4949.248] THE SCOTTISH BORN JAMIE GILLAN,
[ct=4952.465] LEFT-FOOTED KICKER, BACKSPIN.
[ct=4956.442] MADE AT THE 18 YARD LINE BY
[ct=4956.951] TONIGHT'S JOURNEY,
[ct=4957.500] PRESENTED BY CHAIM DAY.
[ct=4962.715] A COUPLE OF TOUCHDOWN PASSES,
[ct=4962.931] JONES, AS WELL.
[ct=4967.252] ONLY THREE MISFIRES AND NABERS
[ct=4971.377] HAD THAT 139 YARD CATCH, SEVEN
[ct=4974.047] OVERALL, BUT THE DALLAS DEFENSE
[ct=4975.619] GOING A GOOD JOB TONIGHT.
[ct=4978.018] CEEDEE LAMB SEVEN 98 WITH A
[ct=4982.805] FIVE POINT GAME, 2:57 LEFT IN
[ct=4983.326] THE THIRD.
[ct=4994.174] A HOLD, AND THAT IS ELLIOTT WITH
[ct=4998.551] A FLAG AND A PAIR AND THE
[ct=4999.078] OFFENSIVE BACKFIELD.
[ct=5002.143] KIRK: I THINK WE HAVE HAD A LOT
[ct=5004.153] OF PEARS, NOT JUST ONE FLAG.
[ct=5006.112] A LOT OF AGREEMENT OUT THERE
[ct=5012.740] AL: KIND OF SORT OF.
[ct=5014.677] KIRK: MAYBE NOT.
[ct=5020.540] >> THERE ARE TWO VALVES ON THE
[ct=5026.065] OFFENSE, NUMBER 73.
[ct=5027.403] HOLDING, NUMBER 56, 10 YARD
[ct=5027.889] PENALTY.
[ct=5030.037] AL: TAKE YOUR PICK.
[ct=5034.027] KIRK: THAT IS NOT GOOD WHEN YOU
[ct=5035.815] HAVE THE CENTER AND THE LEFT
[ct=5037.216] CALL ON A HOLD.
[ct=5040.521] AL: AND THEN YOU SIGNIFY ONE GUY
[ct=5041.526] AND NOW THE OTHER GREG, IT WILL

[ct=6103.069] SAME ROUTE.
[ct=6104.523] THIS TIME TOLD BERT COMES DOWN
[ct=6104.523] WITH IT.
[ct=6112.831] AL: BOUNCING IS WEIGHED.
[ct=6112.831] TO THE 21 YARD LINE.
[ct=6114.629] EIGHT MINUTES TO GO IN
[ct=6114.629] REGULATION.
[ct=6119.129] KIRK: THIS IS A HUGE DRIVE FOR
[ct=6119.129] BOTH OF THESE TEAMS.
[ct=6122.082] THEY CAN SENSE THAT.
[ct=6122.477] UNDER EIGHT MINUTES TO GO.
[ct=6125.420] AN INJURED PLAYER, THIS TIME THE
[ct=6135.110] AL: WE'VE GOT DJ DAVIDSON.
[ct=6142.365] MAKES THE SHORT TRACK OVER TO
[ct=6142.365] THE GIANTS SIDELINE.
[ct=6148.347] KIRK: IF YOU ARE DALLAS, -- IF
[ct=6149.460] YOU ARE NEW YORK, YOU HOLD THEM
[ct=6150.496] TO A FIELD GOAL, YOU FEEL GOOD.
[ct=6155.103] YOU GIVE UP A TOUCHDOWN AND AN
[ct=6155.103] EXTRA POINT P GOOD GOES TO A TWO
[ct=6156.173] POSSESSION GAME.
[ct=6159.239] YOU GET DOWN TO THAT SEVEN
[ct=6159.239] MINUTE MARK.
[ct=6161.178] AL: I'M NOT SURE I FEEL THAT
[ct=6163.641] GOOD THE WAY THE GIANT OFFENSE
[ct=6165.509] IS GOING TONIGHT, YOU KNOW?
[ct=6166.988] YOU DON'T WANT TO GET DOWN BY
[ct=6168.017] MORE THAN A FIELD GOAL.
[ct=6181.126] HALFWAY THROUGH THE CORRIDOR
[ct=6185.707] COWBOYS.
[ct=6188.322] KIRK: YOU GIVE UP SOME YARDS.
[ct=6190.857] THAT'S EXPECTED AGAINST THIS I
[ct=6191.924] PRESCOTT OFFENSE.
[ct=6195.886] THAT'S WHERE YOU RELY ON BRIAN
[ct=6195.886] BRONX.
[ct=6198.336] WE JUST SHOWED YOU SOME
[ct=6199.847] HIGHLIGHTS TONIGHT.
[ct=6207.928] BURNS LINES UP ACROSS ON THE
[ct=6215.888] PRESCOTT, LOOK OUT.
[ct=6218.785] HE THROWS AND INCOMPLETE.
[ct=6221.589] THIBODEAU COMING AROUND THE
[ct=6222.951] CORNER TO BUSTED
[ct=6228.328] KIRK: I DON'T KNOW IF HE
[ct=6228.328] PHYSICALLY GOT TO THAT.
[ct=6232.297] YOU CAN SEE HIM FEEL THE
[ct=6232.297] PRESSURE OFF TO HIS RIGHT.
[ct=6235.080] I THINK IT AFFECTS HIS ACCURACY.
[ct=6238.119] HE JUST FALLS OFF THE THROW TO
[ct=6238.119] HIS LEFT.
[ct=6239.985] THAT IS WHAT BROUGHT THE BALL
[ct=6243.049] THIBODEAU HAVING AN IMPACT
[ct=6244.519] GIANTS FANS HAVE BEEN WAITING
[ct=6247.184] FOR HIM TO BE THAT GUY TO GET
[ct=6247.184] TONIGHT HE HAS BEEN.
[ct=6250.036] AL: AUBREY NOW.
[ct=6253.209] 40 YARDS.
[ct=6257.358] HEGIANTS STADIUM.
[ct=6261.453] EAST RUTHERFORD, NEW JERSEY.
[ct=6262.962] TEMPERATURE RIGHT NOW, ROOM
[ct=6264.265] 72 DEGREES.
[ct=6266.922] KIRK: GREAT TO SEE DIGS -- DIGGS
[ct=6269.751] BACK FROM THE
[ct=6270.884] HE HAD CRAMPING.
[ct=6273.792] AL: PARSONS HAS BEEN IN AND OUT
[ct=6276.457] SINCE HE GOT IT IS -- GOT HIS
[ct=6276.457] ATTENTION.
[ct=6281.806] AUBREY PUT THE GIANTS AT THE 30.
[ct=6284.659] KIRK: OUR NEXGEN STATS POWERED
[ct=6285.067] BY AWS.
[ct=6287.723] PARSONS AGAINST ANDREW THOMAS.
[ct=6290.705] 14 TIMES THEY'VE GONE UP AGAINST
[ct=6292.237] EACH OTHER.
[ct=6294.850] LOOK AT WHAT THE BIG FELLA
[ct=6296.320] DONE.
[ct=6296.320] JUST ONE PRESSURE OFF THE LEFT
[ct=6298.339] SIDE, THE BLIND SIDE OF DANIEL
[ct=6301.238] REALLY GOOD JOB EVEN WHEN HE'S
[ct=6302.930] BEEN ISOLATED.
[ct=6302.930] ABLE TO HOLD ON AGAINST THE PASS
[ct=6305.980] RUSH.
[ct=6306.367] THAT'S WHY PARSONS HAS MOVED
[ct=6309.282] MOVED TO THE OTHER SIDE.
[ct=6310.762] HE'S BACK IN THE LINEUP.
[ct=6316.135] AL: THE FULL COMPLEMENT IN RIGHT
[ct=6321.577] DIGGS IS TOP OF THE SCREEN.
[ct=6321.577] DAVIS CAME TO THE BOTTOM.
[ct=6324.465] JONES ROLLING AND LOOKING AND
[ct=6326.226] THROWING.
[ct=6327.690] HE THREW IT AWAY.
[ct=6330.724] KIRK: THE DEFENSE FROM THE
[ct=6333.527] GIANTS DID THEIR JOB.
[ct=6336.976] UNDER SEVENS TO GO -- SEVEN
[ct=6338.931] MINUTES TO GO.
[ct=6340.350] DANIEL JONES GETS A TON OF
[ct=6340.350] CRITICISM IN THIS TOWN.
[ct=6342.336] HE'S DEALT WITH A HARD KNOCK
[ct=6342.336] STUFF.
[ct=6345.528] A PROVE IT TYPE OF YEAR FOR
[ct=6348.165] NOW HE'S GOT A CHANCE TO
[ct=6349.202] POTENTIALLY LEAD THE OFFENSE.
[ct=6353.330] MAYBE A GAME-WINNING SCORE
[ct=6354.432] AGAINST THEIR BIG RIVAL HERE IN
[ct=6354.432] PRIME TIME.
[ct=6360.939] AL: DALLAS HAS 113-14 MEETINGS
[ct=6362.380] BETWEEN THESE TEAMS INCLUDING
[ct=6363.813] SIX IN A ROW.
[ct=6366.217] JONES THROWS AND IS CAUGHT AT
[ct=6366.217] THE 39 YARD LINE.
[ct=6369.331] YOU ARE RIGHT.
[ct=6370.779] NOBODY HAS BEEN IN THE
[ct=6372.148] CROSSHAIRS MORE THAN JONES.
[ct=6372.939] NUMBER ONE PICK.
[ct=6375.067] SIXTH YEAR.
[ct=6375.067] IT'S QUITE THE SAGA.
[ct=6376.846] WE TALKED ABOUT IT THE OTHER
[ct=6376.846] DAY.
[ct=6379.926] WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY?
[ct=6381.406] WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO
[ct=6382.878] THE NEXT GIANTS QUARTERBACK?
[ct=6384.751] MAKE IT ALL ABOUT FOOTBALL.
[ct=6386.947] FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING OUT --
[ct=6388.258] ELSE.
[ct=6389.590] HERE'S THE GENERAL MANAGER.
[ct=6391.451] THINK ONLY ABOUT FOOTBALL.
[ct=6391.451] THAT'S HARD TO DO IN THIS TOWN.
[ct=6395.002] HE?
[ct=6398.415] AL: THIRD DOWN AND 4.
[ct=6401.501] PRESSURE COMING.
[ct=6401.501] PASS IS CAUGHT.
[ct=6402.960] DOES HE PICK IT UP?
[ct=6410.571] ROBINSON IS TACKLED THERE TO GET
[ct=6411.906] THAT MAKES IT FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=6415.785] LOOKS AT THE SHEET.
[ct=6418.323] ABOUT A HALF A YARD TO GO.
[ct=6422.339] KIRK: AS A CORNERBACK, YOU WOULD
[ct=6423.860] LOVE TO SEE ROBINSON RUN IN
[ct=6426.429] ANOTHER YARD OR TWO FURTHER SO
[ct=6427.888] WHEN YOU GET HIT, YOU ARE BEYOND
[ct=6427.888] THE STICKS.
[ct=6440.651] AL: HE PUTS HIS HEAD DOWN.
[ct=6444.695] THE NAKED EYE LOOKS TO HAVE IT.
[ct=6447.512] AND HE WILL.
[ct=6453.296] KIRK: JUST ENOUGH OF A
[ct=6456.743] GREAT OVERHEAD VIEW OF THIS.
[ct=6458.699] SOME PENETRATION THERE INITIALLY
[ct=6461.572] TO GET DALLAS HAD SOME BIG
[ct=6462.027] BODIES IN THEIR BUT HE'S ABLE TO
[ct=6464.784] BOUNCE IT AWAY.
[ct=6469.086] WILSON TRYING TO GET IN THERE.
[ct=6470.592] GOOD SURGE.
[ct=6474.767] AL: INSIDE OF FIVE MINUTES.
[ct=6476.765] JONES UNDER PRESSURE.
[ct=6480.172] TO THE OUTSIDE NEIGHBORS.
[ct=6482.041] FORWARD PROGRESS IS STOPPED BY
[ct=6482.041] JORDAN
[ct=6486.161] KIRK: 12 CATCHES NOW FOR
[ct=6490.883] YOU HAVE TO THINK WITH WHAT HE'S
[ct=6492.263] DONE HERE EARLY IN HIS CAREER,
[ct=6492.881] THIS IS GO TIME FOR HIM.
[ct=6494.938] WE'VE SEEN HIM GET MORE
[ct=6496.376] OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SECOND
[ct=6498.311] GABLE WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT,
[ct=6499.693] WHERE CAN I GET HIM MATCHED UP?
[ct=6502.585] GOT TO MAKE THEM GO TO SOMEBODY
[ct=6513.708] IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=6516.468] PARSONS TAKES TRACY DOWN.
[ct=6518.492] HE TAKES THE HANDOFF.
[ct=6521.601] KIRK: WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THAT
[ct=6523.435] MATCH UP WITH IAN ANDREW THOMAS.
[ct=6524.918] GOOD JOB.
[ct=6526.835] LOOK AT THIS MOVE OUTSIDE AND
[ct=6526.835] BACK INSIDE.
[ct=6528.274] SET HIM UP AND GET INSIDE OF
[ct=6529.752] HIM.
[ct=6532.759] AGAINST A REALLY GOOD LEFT
[ct=6535.556] SUPERIOR PLAY RIGHT THERE BY
[ct=6536.994] MICAH PARSONS IN CRUNCH TIME.
[ct=6540.178] LATERAL QUICKNESS
[ct=6541.628] SO ELITES.
[ct=6544.650] AL: EVERY THIRD DOWN IN CRUNCH
[ct=6545.845] TIME IS VITAL.
[ct=6547.569] HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.
[ct=6552.525] KIRK: FOLLOWING ONE EVERYWHERE.
[ct=6559.809] AL: JONES OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=6559.809] THAT'S INCOMPLETE.
[ct=6563.919] ROBINSON LOOKING FOR A FLAG.
[ct=6569.886] INJURED COWBOY BACK AT THE 35
[ct=6577.955] KIRK: THE BALL GOT IN THEIR.
[ct=6579.821] ROBINSON, ANY TIME YOU GET BOTH
[ct=6582.625] HANDS ON A FOOTBALL, CHANCE TO
[ct=6584.094] BE ABLE TO CATCH THAT FOR A
[ct=6587.389] PARSONS, WE TALKED ABOUT HIM
[ct=6587.389] MOVING FROM THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=6591.586] THIS TIME RIGHT OVER TOP OF THE
[ct=6595.824] AL: IT HUNG UP WITH GREG VAN
[ct=6598.397] ROTEN.
[ct=6602.840] AND HE' BLUE
[ct=6604.277] 10.
[ct=6609.009] MARCUS LAWRENCE IS OUT.
[ct=6610.384] TWO KEY GUYS.
[ct=6614.248] MARSHAWN KNEELAND IS IN.
[ct=6615.761] CHAUNCEY GOLSTON IS IN.
[ct=6618.425] THE GIANTS RIGHT NOW HAVE A
[ct=6623.148] FOURTH AND 6 AT THE 45.
[ct=6625.508] THEY COULD LAND A 3-3.
[ct=6627.151] HAVE TO GET TO THE COWBOY 49
[ct=6643.051] THE SURVEYS.
[ct=6643.051] CHASED AWAY.
[ct=6646.204] CHASED FROM BEHIND.
[ct=6653.011] IT DOES NOT.
[ct=6657.389] THE OFFICIALS NOW
[ct=6658.896] WITH EACH OTHER.
[ct=6660.427] THREE ARE SAYING NO.
[ct=6667.013] KIRK: HE NEVER HAD POSSESSION OF
[ct=6667.013] THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=6671.541] GOOD JOB WITH THE OFFICIALS
[ct=6671.541] COMING TOGETHER.
[ct=6674.193] THE OFFICIAL BEHIND NEIG
[ct=6675.702] THOUGHT HE MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
[ct=6676.046] HOLD ON TO THE BALL FROM THIS
[ct=6677.529] PERSPECTIVE.
[ct=6681.829] YOU CAN SEE THAT THE BALL DOES
[ct=6681.829] COME OUT.
[ct=6688.507] CLEARLY IT IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=6691.308] THEY TURN THE BALL OVER AND THEY
[ct=6695.509] ARE FORCED TO HAVE TO USE THE
[ct=6699.431] THEY HAD TO SPEND ONE IN THE
[ct=6700.825] THIRD QUARTER WHEN JONES HAD A
[ct=6704.957] KIRK: HOW ABOUT THE EFFORT BY
[ct=6704.957] NEIGHBORS?
[ct=6707.842] IF HE HOLDS ONTO THE BALL, HIS
[ct=6708.316] FEET ARE DOWN.
[ct=6716.995] AL: COMING INTO THE GAME, WE
[ct=6718.395] HIGHLIGHTED THE SPECTACULAR
[ct=6718.395] DEBUT.
[ct=6724.206] WHEN OBJ BROKEN NUMBER OF YEARS
[ct=6725.600] AGO AND MADE GREAT CATCH AFTER
[ct=6727.005] GREAT CATCH.
[ct=6727.508] HE'S ABLE TO GET UP.
[ct=6729.038] MEANWHILE, PARSONS COMES OUT OF
[ct=6732.030] THE TENT BUT ONTO THE CART.
[ct=6733.138] THE COWBOYS AT LEAST HAVE THE
[ct=6740.286] MANY -- MINI BYE WEEK.
[ct=6743.098] IT WILL TAKE NEIGHBORS TO THE
[ct=6743.557] BLUE TENT AS WELL.
[ct=6745.139] SO THE COWBOYS DON'T HAVE TO
[ct=6746.603] PLAY ANOTHER GAME UNTIL THEY GO
[ct=6750.378] TO PITTSBURGH AND 10 DAYS -- IN
[ct=6752.150] PERSON GOES BACK TO THE LOCKER
[ct=6756.412] THE GIANTS WITH THEIR NEXT GAME
[ct=6757.378] IN SEATTLE.
[ct=6757.378] NO BARGAIN.
[ct=6763.648] NOW THE COWBOYS CAN PLAY A
[ct=6763.648] LITTLE CLOCK BALL HERE.
[ct=6767.855] TWO TIMEOUTS FOR THE GIANTS PLUS
[ct=6769.098] A TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
[ct=6777.149] START ON THE GROUND.
[ct=6784.425] NOT QUITE THE COMPLETE OLD ZEKE.
[ct=6790.155] KIRK: IT HELPS WHEN YOU HAVE AN
[ct=6791.566] OFFENSIVE LINE THAT'S OPENING UP
[ct=6791.951] A WHOLE AND LETTING HIM GET
[ct=6791.951] DOWNHILL.
[ct=6796.171] SECOND LEVEL DEFENSE.
[ct=6798.890] JUST WONDER FOR THE GIANTS, DOWN
[ct=6798.890] FIVE HERE.
[ct=6801.885] OBVIOUSLY DALLAS WILL WORK
[ct=6801.885] CLOCK.
[ct=6808.896] GABLE HOPING TO BE ABLE TO HOLD
[ct=6809.299] THEM TO A FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT.
[ct=6816.148] AL: THAT WOULD MAKE IT AN EIGHT
[ct=6816.148] POINT GAME.
[ct=6823.517] THEY HAVE ONE TIMEOUT.
[ct=6826.348] TOOK THEIR SECOND RIGHT THERE.
[ct=6829.862] DIGGS RECOVERING ON THE
[ct=6834.102] GOING BACK AND FORTH.
[ct=6838.612] ELLIOTT PUTS HIS SHOULDER DOWN.
[ct=6841.494] COMES UP A LITTLE BIT SHORT.
[ct=6843.081] THE GIANTS HAVE TO TAKE THEIR
[ct=6843.081] FINAL TIMEOUT.
[ct=6847.137] REFEREE: 30 SECONDS.
[ct=6850.454] AL: THIS GAME HAS NOT BEEN A
[ct=6853.382] BARNBURNER OR A
[ct=6853.873] THE COWBOYS HAVE TO DO SO MUCH
[ct=6857.942] JUST GETTING SHREDDED THE LAST
[ct=6857.942] TWO WEEKS BY NEW ORLEANS.
[ct=6866.040] MISSING LAWRENCE A LOT.
[ct=6867.580] PARSONS HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF
[ct=6869.129] HAVE TO BE PROUD O
[ct=6870.190] DONE TONIGHT.
[ct=6873.371] KIRK: THEY'VE DONE A HECK OF A
[ct=6873.813] JOB WITH THE MENTALITY OF THE
[ct=6877.950] IF I’
[ct=6882.259] IF I'M A COWBOYS FAN, THEY ARE
[ct=6883.477] EXCITED TO SEE THIS EFFORT.
[ct=6886.427] AL: THIRD-ONE.
[ct=6890.300] I YARD AND A HALF.
[ct=6890.300] THAT'S ENOUGH.
[ct=6893.681] LIPKE PICKS UP THE FIRST OUT.
[ct=6895.055] THE ONLY TIME THE CLOCK WILL
[ct=6896.661] STOP NOW IS AT THE TWO-MINUTE
[ct=6896.661] WARNING.
[ct=6900.808] THEY TAKE NEIGHBORS BACK TO THE
[ct=6906.277] 10 DAYS UNTIL THEY GO TO SEATTLE
[ct=6907.075] FOR THE NEXT ONE.
[ct=6910.585] KIRK: PHYSICAL GAME TONIGHT.
[ct=6910.585] SLOPPY GAME.
[ct=6912.312] I DON'T CARE.
[ct=6914.968] IF YOU ARE A DALLAS COWBOYS FAN,
[ct=6916.599] SIT THERE STARING.
[ct=6918.070] POTENTIALLY DROPPING TO 1-3.
[ct=6919.577] TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF HERE
[ct=6922.286] WITH A WIN TO GET SITTING THERE
[ct=6926.332] AT REFEREE: -- THAT'S OK.
[ct=6929.130] AL: THERE'S THE UPCOMING
[ct=6929.130] SCHEDULE.
[ct=6930.974] ELLIOTT IS TAKEN DOWN THE
[ct=6935.618] MCFADDEN MAKES THE TACKLE.
[ct=6942.580] FOR DANIEL JONES TONIGHT,
[ct=6942.990] NUMBERS WERE GOOD.
[ct=6945.795] 29-37.
[ct=6947.374] BUT THEY CAN’
[ct=6948.899] BUT THEY CAN'T FINISH THE DRIVE.
[ct=6951.672] FIVE FIELD GOALS.
[ct=6951.672] THAT WILL DO IT.
[ct=6956.340] KIRK: JONES PLAYED WELL.
[ct=6957.658] PLAYED HAPPY RIDE HOME.
[ct=6962.109] IF THEY HOLD ON HERE, THEY WILL
[ct=6962.109] GO TO [NO AUDIO]
[ct=6968.516] -- 2-0 AWAY.
[ct=6979.159] THAT GUY HAS TO BE REALLY HAPPY
[ct=6982.082] THERE HE IS.
[ct=6984.827] MIKE SIMMER.
[ct=6986.527] HE COMES IN.
[ct=6990.412] TAKES OVER.
[ct=6991.439] NUMBER FIVE DEFENSE LAST YEAR.
[ct=6993.137] TONIGHT, TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.
[ct=6996.100] GIVING UP 464 INTO GAMES.
[ct=7000.706] -- IN TWO GAMES.
[ct=7000.706] THE GIANTS ARE AVERAGING 1.1
[ct=7002.174] YARD PER RUSH.
[ct=7005.196] KIRK: THEY BIT ABOUT IT -- DI
[ct=7006.843] BETTER JOB ON THE DEFENSIVE
[ct=7010.956] TONIGHT, OVER SHOWN.
[ct=7012.479] NUMBER 13.
[ct=7013.945] I THINK THEY
[ct=7014.268] LINEBACKER NEXT TO HIM RIGHT
[ct=7017.244] HE PLAYED REALLY WELL.
[ct=7017.244] HE WAS ALL OVER THE FIELD.
[ct=7022.234] AL: TO THE 33 GOES DOWN.
[ct=7026.906] SO THEY WILL TAKE IT ALL THE WAY
[ct=7026.906] DOWN HERE.
[ct=7030.984] AUBREY STARTS OUT ONTO THE
[ct=7038.280] SO AS IT LOOKS RIGHT NOW, A LOT
[ct=7042.760] OF PEOPLE ARE VERY HAPPY THAT
[ct=7044.251] THERE WILL BE A FIELD GOAL
[ct=7044.251] ATTEMPT.
[ct=7045.411] OTHERS NOT SO HAPPY.
[ct=7047.928] YOU DO KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
[ct=7052.859] SO THIS WILL BE A 51 YARD
[ct=7064.156] OF ALL THINGS, NO GOOD.
[ct=7067.224] IT'S HIS FIRST EVER MISS FROM 50
[ct=7067.698] PLUS.
[ct=7073.440] SO THE PATIENT IS BREATHING.
[ct=7073.440] JUST BARELY THOUGH.
[ct=7077.751] KIRK: AND NOT JUST A MISS.
[ct=7079.146] LOOK FOR THE FIELD POSITION.
[ct=7083.404] THIS IS THE RISK THAT YOU TAKE
[ct=7083.404] WHEN YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE IN A
[ct=7085.268] KICKER THAT CAN MAKE THESE LONG
[ct=7085.268] KICKS.
[ct=7088.095] THE BALL WILL BE AT THE 41-YARD
[ct=7091.004] LINE FOR DANIEL JONES WHO IS OUT
[ct=7092.476] OF TIMEOUTS, AND EXPERIENCED
[ct=7093.581] GUY.
[ct=7096.621] HAS TO WORK THE SIDELINES AND BE
[ct=7096.621] SMART HERE.
[ct=7098.539] LET'S SEE IF THEY CAN GET INTO
[ct=7101.316] DEEP ENOUGH
[ct=7102.824] SHOT.
[ct=7105.257] AL: DON'T FORGET
[ct=7108.207] CRAZIER THINGS HAVE HAPPENED.
[ct=7109.522] NO TIMEOUTS.
[ct=7115.974] LOOKING FOR A JUMP.
[ct=7118.521] GET DOWN THE SIDELINE.
[ct=7118.521] BROKEN
[ct=7120.134] INTENDED FOR ROBINSON.
[ct=7122.927] KIRK: MALIKA GOES FOR THE
[ct=7124.024] INTERCEPTION.
[ct=7128.581] THE BALL GOES OVER HIS HEAD.
[ct=7130.423] ROBINSON GETS BEHIND HIM.
[ct=7132.653] I THINK HE LOST A FOOTBALL BUT
[ct=7134.581] WHAT A RISK THAT HOOKER TAKES
[ct=7135.965] TRYING TO LOCATE THE BALL, GO
