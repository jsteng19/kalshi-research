AS THE HEAD
COACH OF THE GREEN BAY
PACKERS.
THE COMMANDERS WILL KICKOFF
AS WASHINGTON WON THE TOSS
AND THEY HAVE DEFERRED.
OFF WE GO FROM LAMBEAU
FIELD.
WITH A RUN BACK.
THE NEW RULES OF THE KICKOFF
HAVE CREATED A LOT MORE
EXCITEMENT.
TO THE 29 YARD LINE GOES
WILLIAMS.
THE ROOKIE OUT OF TCU.
HE HAD 11 INTERCEPTIONS.
ALL OF THEM CAME EARLIER IN
THE YEAR.
WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT
OFFENSIVE LINE.
IT HAS BEEN RESTRUCTURED
BECAUSE OF INJURIES COMING
INTO THE GAME TONIGHT.
STARTING FROM THE 28 YARD
LINE.
THEY BEGIN WITH A RUN.
TO THE RIGHT SIDE.
JOSH JACOBS PICKS UP ABOUT
FOUR.
HERE IS THE RESTRUCTURED
OFFENSIVE LINE.
KIRK: THIS IS A BIG CONCERN
WITH THE INJURIES.
A ROOKIE MAKING HIS FIRST
CAREER START.
THE ROOKIE OUT OF NORTH
CAROLINA STATE.
HE IS GOING UP AGAINST THE
DEFENSIVE FRONT THAT HAD A
GREAT GAME LAST WEEK AGAINST
THE GIANTS.
COMMUNICATION WILL BE KEY ON
THE RIGHT SIDE.
ESPECIALLY WITH THE MOVEMENT
THAT THEY LIKE TO USE.
AL: SECOND AND 6.
CONTACT MADE AT THE LINE OF
SCRIMMAGE.
JACOBS WAS ABLE TO PICK UP A
COUPLE OF YARDS.
IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND4.
KIRK: JORDAN LOVE IN HIS
THIRD YEAR TAKING OVER.
HE SAID HE APPRECIATED AN
OPPORTUNITY TO SIT HIS FIRST
THREE YEARS BEHIND EVENTUAL
HALL OF FAMER AARON RODGERS.
HE LEARNED SO MUCH.
EVEN LAST WEEK, YOU SEE A
GUY HE WAS IN COMMAND.
THE PLAYERS AROUND HIM HAVE
GROWN UP WITH HIM.
WHEN THEY GET INTO THESE
THIRD DOWN STAIR IS REAL
TRUST IN HIM.
AL: THIRD DOWN AND A LONG 3.
THE FIRST PASS TO THE
OUTSIDE AND IT IS CAUGHT.
THE MAN IN MOTION.
TACKLED BY LATTIMORE.
YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF
PRE-SNAP MOVEMENT.
GOOD JOB OF MOVING.
NUMBER 13 ON THE LEFT.
MAN-TO-MAN.
LOOK AT THE DEPTHS HE WAS
ABLE TO GET BECAUSE OF THE
SOFT COVERAGE.
LATTIMORE HAD TO MOVE, HAD
TO STAY WITH WICKS.
HE GAVE HIM SOME CUSHION.
EASY PITCH AND CATCH FOR
JORDAN LOVE.
AL: HE SPREADS IT AROUND.
LAST WEEK, 10 DIFFERENT
RECEIVERS.
PLAY-ACTION.
WICKS AGAIN.
BACK TO BACK.
ANOTHER FIRST DOWN.
KIRK: AGAIN YOU SEE MOVEMENT
HERE.
THE COMMANDERS DO NOT RUN
WITH THE MOTION.
THEY WERE WAITING TO SIT
BACK AND PLAY A LITTLE SOFT
IN THEIR COVERAGE.
IT IS VERY EASY TO BE ABLE
TO HIT THESE THROWS.
TRYING TO FORCE THE
COMMANDERS EARLY.
HE IS IN RHYTHM.
NICE, EASY THROW.
FIRST DOWN.
AL: MOTION AGAIN.
THIS TIME THROUGH THE
MIDDLE.
JOSH JACOBS, HE CAME UP WITH
THE RAIDERS.
HE IS SECOND IN ONLY --
ALMOST EVERY IMPORTANT
RUSHING CATEGORY, ECLIPSED
ONLY BY DERRICK HENRY.
KIRK: HE IS THE PERFECT FIT
WITH MATT LAFLEUR AND WHAT
THEY LIKE TO DO.
THE PHYSICAL AND SET UP PLAY
ACTION THE FIELD.
YOU THINK ABOUT AS THE
WEATHER CHANGES, HE IS A
PERFECT FIT.
WE SAW THAT LAST YEAR AND IT
WILL CONTINUE THIS YEAR.
AL: 300 CARRIES LAST YEAR.
THE PLAY FAKE, THE PASS IS
INCOMPLETE OVER THE MIDDLE.
A FLAG IS THROWN.
DOBBS ONE OF THE BIG
RECEIVERS LAST WEEK.
LATTIMORE I THINK WELL GET
FLAGGED HERE.
KIRK: RIGHT AT THE TOP OF
THE ROUTE.
GOOD MOVEMENT INSIDE BY
DOBBS.
A LITTLE HANDS THE.
-- HANDSY.
THAT IS A GOOD CALL.
AL: LATTIMORE TONIGHT HAS
GIVEN UP A COUPLE OF THEM --
COMPLETIONS HAVE BEEN
FLAGGED FOR INTERFERENCE.
HE HAS HAD BETTER STARTS.
KIRK: YOU FEEL LIKE THIS IS
AN OFFENSE THAT WANTS TO GET
THE BALL DOWN THE FIELD.
THE COMMANDERS ARE SITTING
BACK A LITTLE BIT ON THIS
OPENING DRIVE.
EVENTUALLY THEY WILL GET THE
BALL DOWNFIELD.
FORCING THE COMMANDERS TO
COME UP.
AL: FROM THE 40 YARD LINE.
THE PACKERS ALREADY WITH
THREE FIRST DOWNS ON THIS
DRIVE.
YOU GET A WHISTLE BEFORE THE
SNAP.
REFEREE: FALSE START,
OFFENSE, NUMBER EIGHT.
FIVE YARD PENALTY, FIRST
DOWN.
AL: THAT WILL BE ON JACOBS.
KIRK: LAST WEEK THEY REALLY
EMPHASIZE, NEW SEASON,
AGAINST DETROIT, THEY WANTED
TO START FAST.
THEY ENDED UP CONVERTING
THREE THIRD DOWNS OF THE
OPENING DRIVE.
ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT, SHORT
WEEKS, THEY WANT TO BE THAT
TEAM, AGGRESSIVE.
LETS SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO.
AL: THEY TOOK THE LIONS OUT
OF THE GAME EARLY AND IT
NEVER GOT INTO IT.
GOING DEEP INTO TRAFFIC AND
INCOMPLETE.
A LITTLE BIT OUT OF THE
REACH OF WICKS.
SECOND DOWN AND 15.
KIRK: WE TALKED ABOUT HOW
EVENTUALLY THEY WILL GET THE
BALL DOWNFIELD.
ABLE TO GET BEHIND THE
SAFETY.
HE GOT BEHIND HIM.
HIS EYES WERE IN THE
BACKFIELD.
THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD WAS
OPEN.
HE IS BACK THERE.
HE DOESNT REALLY FIND THE
FOOTBALL UNTIL HE GETS
AROUND.
LOVE NOT ABLE TO CONNECT ON
THE DEEP SHOT.
AL: WICKS HAS BEEN TARGETED
ON ALL THREE OF THE PASSES.
SECOND AND 15.
HANGS IN THE POCKET.
TO THE OUTSIDE HE GOES.
MAKING THE CATCH.
THIRD A LONG.
KIRK: THESE ARE THOSE THIRD
DOWNS, THIS WILL BE A BIG
PART OF THE GAME TONIGHT.
CAN SEE MATT LAFLEUR IS
FILED A -- FIRED UP.
JACOBS COMES OFF THE FIELD.
AL: OPENING DRIVE OF THE
GAME.
A DEEP DROP.
UNDER PRESSURE, STEPS UP,
GOING DEEP AND IN THE CORNER
OF THE END ZONE FOR A
TOUCHDOWN AT LEAST FOR THE
MOMENT.
HE IS HURT.
THE PENALTY IS GOING TO
BRING IT BACK.
KIRK: THE ROOKIE RIGHT
TACKLE WHO WE TALKED ABOUT,
THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION ON
THIRD DOWN WITH THE
MOVEMENT.
VERY TOUGH FOR THE
COMMUNICATION.
AL: YOU HAVE A PENALTY, THE
TOUCHDOWN IS NEGATED ON A
GUY WHO HAS HAD A LEFT FOOT
FRACTURE AND PLAYED THROUGH
IT.
KIRK: THIS IS WHAT THE
COMMANDERS WANT TO DO.
FORCE THEM TO COMMUNICATE
WITH THE RIGHT GUARD.
A LITTLE BIT OF A STUNT.
BY THE TIME HE GOT IT, THE
RIGHT ARM WAS AROUND HIM.
THAT NEGATES THE TOUCHDOWN.
A HECK OF A CATCH.
AL: HE IS ABLE TO JOG OFF
THE FIELD.
THIRD DOWN AND 19.
KIRK: HE REALLY DID NOT HAVE
A CHANCE TO PROTECT HIMSELF.
ALREADY DEALING WITH A FOOT
INJURY.
AL: 55 CATCHES LAST YEAR.
THAT IS A LOW NUMBER FOR A
TEAM LEADER BUT THEY SPREAD
IT AROUND.
THIRD AND 19.
FOUR MAN RUSH.
BROOKS HAS ROOM.
HE WILL GET TO THE 32 YARD
LINE.
NOW WHAT?
DO YOU BRING IN THE FIELD
GOAL UNIT?
THEY ARE GOING TO GO UP TO
THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE
QUICKLY.
THEY LINE UP TO GO FOR IT.
DO THEY GO FOR IT?
THEY WILL.
DEEP DROP AGAIN, TO THE
OUTSIDE, IT IS BUSTED UP AT
THE END BY THE ROOKIE.
THE SECOND ROUND PICK OUT OF
MISSISSIPPI.
MATTHEW GOLDEN WAS THE
INTENDED RECEIVER.
THE DRIVE BOGS DOWN.
HE ONLY PLAYED SEVEN YEARS.
THE COMMANDERS HAVE THE BALL
AFTER THE FAILED FOURTH DOWN
ATTEMPT.
MICAH PARSONS IN THE GAME TO
START IT OUT.
HE PLAYED 29 SNAPS ON
SUNDAY.
THE PASS GOES TO THE
OUTSIDE.
TAKEN IN BY AUSTIN EKELER.
KIRK: THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT
OF CONFUSION WHEN GREEN BAY
WENT FAST.
YOU CAN SEE THE OFFICIAL
STANDING OVER THE BALL.
THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A
FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT.
SO A MISCOMMUNICATION.
HE RAN OUT ON THE FIELD
THINKING IT WAS A FIELD GOAL
AND THEN THEY PULLED HIM
BACK OFTEN THAT BECAUSE THE
OFFICIAL TO STAND OVER THE
BALL.
AL: HE IS PRETTY GOOD AT
CHEWING PEOPLE OUT.
SECOND DOWN AND 7.
JAYDEN DANIELS LOVES TO GO
TO HIS RIGHT.
HE TRIES TO TAKE OFF BUT
CANNOT.
TRIPPED UP AT THE LINE OF
SCRIMMAGE.
KIRK: LIKE MOST
QUARTERBACKS, A LOT OF GUYS
LIKE TO STEP UP AND THEY GO
TO THEIR RIGHT.
THE RIGHT.
THE RIGHT-HANDED
QUARTERBACKS.
GREEN BAY OBVIOUSLY KNOWS
THAT.
THEY ARE DETERMINED TO TRY
TO MAKE HIM WORK TO THE LEFT
AWAY FROM THE RIGHT SIDE.
IT IS KIND OF A CAT AND
MOUSE GAME BETWEEN THE GREEN
BAY DEFENSE AGAINST THIS
WASHINGTON OFFENSE.
AL: THIRD DOWN AND 8.
DANIELS IN TRAFFIC.
EKELER MAKES THE CATCH.
SHORT OF A FIRST DOWN.
A VERY RAPID THREE AND OUT
FOR WASHINGTON.
WILLIAMS AND ON THE STOP.
MICAH PARSONS, LAST WEEK
THEY WERE NOT EVEN SURE HE
WOULD PLAY.
HE PLAYED HALF THE SNAPS.
KIRK: HE WILL MOVE ALL OVER
THE PLACE.
HERE HE IS LINED IT UP ON
THE RIGHT SIDE.
A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF HOLDING
HIM OUT.
YOU SEE A QUICK SMILE.
YOU WILL SEE THAT A LOT FROM
JAYDEN DANIELS.
GOOD JOB OF CONFUSING HIM.
MAKING HIM HOLD THE BALL.
HE GOT CONFUSED ON THE THIRD
DOWN.
AL: HE TOOK A SHOT LAST WEEK
BUT HE IS OK.
MATTHEW GOLDEN, THE NUMBER
ONE DRAFT CHOICE, THE SPEEDY
ROOKIE BACKS UP.
HE GETS TAKEN DOWN.
A GREAT TACKLE AND GREAT
COVERAGE AND A LITTLE BIT
EXTRA AT THE END.
BUTLER WITH GREAT COVERAGE.
A FLAG THROWN.
BRAD ROGERS WILL SORT THIS
OUT.
THAT WAS A 55 YARD PUNT.
GOLDEN LOST ANOTHER TWO ON
THE RETURN.
CHECK OUT THE
EXTRACURRICULAR STUFF.
THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE
TALKING ABOUT.
REFEREE: THERE IS NO FOUL ON
THE PLAY.
AL: THEY GOT TANGLED UP.
CALLED INCIDENTAL.
8:08 IN THE QUARTER.
STILL NO AFTER THAT GREAT PUNT,
GREEN DAY IS BACKED UP.
FOR THEIR SECOND POSSESSION.
OFF THE FAKE.
ON THE SIDELINE.
THEY GO TO THE TIGHT END
COMING OFF A GREAT SEASON.
A TOUGH MAN TO TACKLE.
KAYLEE: EARLIER WE SO I
PACKERS RECEIVER COME DOWN
HARD ON HIS RIGHT SHOULDER.HE WILL PROBABLY HEAD BACK
TO THE LOCKER ROOM AND INTO
THE X-RAY ROOM.
AL: THEY WILL PROBABLY NOT
BE WITH HIM FOR THE REST OF
THE GAME.
JOSH JACOBS PICKS UP FIVE.
KIRK: YOU WILL SEE WILLIAMS,
THE ROOKIE OUT OF TCU,
PROBABLY GET SOME
OPPORTUNITIES.
WE SAW HIM IN SPECIAL TEAMS
EARLIER.
HE HAD ONE CAREER START LAST
YEAR.
AL: HE HAS STARTED EVERY
GAME.
SECONDHAND 6.
WIDE OPEN.
GETTING INTO WASHINGTON
TERRITORY.
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE 20
YARD LINE.
TUCKER KRAFT GETS A FIRST
DOWN AND THEN A HUGE PLAY
HERE.
57 YARDS.
KIRK: WATCH THE LINEBACKERS
REACT HERE.
A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION.
THE SAFETY GETS OCCUPIED.
THAT OPENS UP A GREAT SEEING
BEFORE THE QUARTERBACK TO
MAKE A GREAT THROW.
GOOD JOB OF RECOGNIZING
THAT.
THERE IS TUCKER KRAFT AGAIN.
VERY UNDERRATED AND POWERFUL
TIGHT END FOR THE PACKERS.
AL: HE STARTED AGAINST
DETROIT LAST WEEK.
MATT LAFLEUR KEEPS GETTING
ASKED, WHO IS YOUR NUMBER
ONE RECEIVER?
KIRK: YOU GET ALL THOSE GUYS
INVOLVED.
WATSON IS ON THE PUP LIST
FOR A FEW WEEKS.
HE IS HOPING TO COME BACK.
IN THE MEANTIME, MATTHEW
GOLDEN, THE ROOKIE OUT OF
TEXAS COMING TO BECOME LIKE
GOD.
HE IS A DIFFERENCE MAKER.
LETS SEE IF THEY GET HIM
ISOLATED TONIGHT.
HE HAS GREAT SPEED.
AL: ROLLING, UNDER PRESSURE,
A LITTLE FLOATING PASS.
IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 9.
KIRK: THEY WENT OUT EVEN
THOUGH THEY GOT TO THE NFC
CHAMPIONSHIP GAME AND
DEFENSIVELY RETOOLED.
THERE DEFENSE RANKED 30TH IN
THE NFL IN DEFENDING THE
RUN.
THEY ARE BETTER AT GETTING
AFTER THE QUARTERBACK.
AL: THE GENERAL MANAGER PUT
A MAJOR PREMIUM ON A
DEFENSIVE SIDE OF THE BALL.
THIRD DOWN AND 9 NOW.
CHASED OUT.
CAN YOU GET THE FIRST DOWN?
YES.
THE CROWD LOVES IT.
KIRK: WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
JAYDEN DANIELS YOU HAVE TO
LOOK FOR FOR THESE
SITUATIONS.
JORDAN LOVE HAS THE ABILITY
TO MAKE A DEFENSE PLAY.
WHAT I LOVE IS THE END OF
THIS.
INSTEAD OF GETTING DOWN, HE
LOWERS THE SHOULDER AND GOES
RIGHT OVER THE SAFETY
MARTIN.
THAT IS A WAY TO GET YOUR
OFFICE TO RESPOND.
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID DID
DOWN TO PROTECT YOURSELF.
BUT HE REALLY SPENT A
MESSAGE TO THE DEFENSE.
AL: NOW YOU HAVE THE TIGHT
END WHO IS DOWN.
HE NEEDS ATTENTION.
BUT SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO
HIM.
AL: HE IS FINE.
HE WALKS TO THE SIDELINE.
HAS THE HELMET ON.
JACOBS IS THE RUNNING BACK.
FIRST AND GOAL FROM THE FIVE
YARD LINE.
THE PASS CAUGHT, TOUCHDOWN,
GREEN BAY.
ROMEO DOBBS.
A DRIVE THAT STARTED AT
THEIR OWN FOUR YARD LINE
GOES 96 YARDS AND SEVEN
PLAYS.
LOOK AT THIS FORMATION TO
THE LEFT.
THEY JUST ASSUMING IT IS A
RUN.
THE LINEBACKER COMES UP.
YOU HAVE A ONE-ON-ONE
MATCHUP.
GREAT RELEASE OF THE LINE OF
SCRIMMAGE FROM DOBBS.
GIVE MATT LAFLEUR A LOT OF
CREDIT.
A GOOD CALL EARLY TO HIT THE
TOUCHDOWN.
AL: BRANDON MCMANUS WITH THE
EXTRA POINT.
4:30 TO
AL: NOT EVEN 11 MINUTES INTO
THE GAME, GREEN BAY HAS
GAINED 145 YARDS AND
WASHINGTON, SIX YARDS.
AL: THEY ARE AVERAGING NINE
YARDS PER PLAY.
THEY ARE KNOWN FOR THE BIG
PLAY ABILITY.
JORDAN LOVE IN HIS THIRD
YEAR AS A STARTER, THE
PIECES AROUND HIM, YOU CAN
SEE THE CONTINUITY AND
CONFIDENCE THAT THEY PLAY
WITH.
IT HAS BEEN ON DISPLAY IN
THIS FIRST QUARTER.
AL: MATT LAFLEUR HAS BEEN
THE PLAY CALLER ALL SEVEN
YEARS.
KIRK: AS GOOD AS ANYONE IN
THE LEAGUE AT ATTACKING
DEFENSES.
HE HAS A COMBINATION OF
BEING ABLE TO GET PHYSICAL
AND RUN DOWNHILL.
THE RECEIVERS ARE OFF TO A
GREAT START IN THIS GAME.
AL: MCMANUS WILL KICKOFF.
THIS WILL BE FIELDED IN THE
END ZONE.
THAT IS A TOUCHBACK WHICH IS
A RARE THING THESE DAYS.
WE TAKE A LOOK AT JAYDEN
DANIELS.
HEISMAN TROPHY WINNER AT LSU
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
OFFENSIVE ROOKIE OF THE YEAR
LAST YEAR.
HE GOT THEM INTO THE
PLAYOFFS.
A ROOKIE QUARTERBACK RECORD
FOR RUSHING.
HE IS OFF TO A GREAT START
THIS YEAR.
LAST YEAR -- LAST WEEK HE
HAD 67 YARDS.
KIRK: WE WILL SEE HOW THE
GAME GOES.
THEY ARE TRYING TO EMPHASIZE
HIM EVERY WEEK IN RUNNING.
TRY TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.
A LOT OF IT IS HIM CREATING
AND MAKING PLAYS.
AL: THE BALL COMES OUT TO
THE 35 YARD LINE AFTER THE
TOUCHBACK.
HANDED OFF.
THE TACKLE BY VANNESS.
KIRK: WE TALKED ABOUT HOW
THEY LIKE TO RUN HIM FROM
TIME TO TIME.
THIS IS AN OLD SCHOOL
COLLEGE FOOTBALL ZONE READ.
THE QUARTERBACK HAS TO
PULLED OUT AND GET AWAY.
THAT WAS A MISS READ BY
JAYDEN DANIELS.
AL: SECOND AND 11.
THE FORMER CHARGER.
HIS NINTH YEAR IN THE
LEAGUE.
THIRD AND 7 I KNOW IT IS
ONLY A WEEK AT A QUARTER BUT
WITH MICAH PARSONS COMING.
KIRK:?
IT IS AS MUCH ENERGY ON A
DEFENSE THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN
THE NFL IN THE FIRST WEEK.
HAD IT IS CONTINUING
TONIGHT.
AL: DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS.
THIRDHAND 7.
DEEP DROP.
THROWS UNDERNEATH.
DID HE GET THE FIRST DOWN?
HE IS A YARD SHIVE.
A FLAG IS DOWN.
THAT TIME IT WAS PARSONS
RUSHING.
KIRK: THIS WILL EITHER BE A
HOLDING CALL OR ROUGHING.
THEY TWISTED HIM.
AL: THEY CALL THAT AUTOMATIC
GREAT.
KIRK: THEY WILL STUNT HIM
AND WORK HIM AROUND.
HE IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
HE HAS LEVERAGE.
THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE.
THAT IS THE WAY THE IMPACTS
THE GAME.
THE MOVEMENT.
THE POWER AND THE SPEED.
HE PUSHES THEM BACK ON THIRD
DOWN.
AL: THIRDHAND 17.
NOTHING HAPPENING.
FOURTH DOWN.
KIRK: THE BEAUTY OF THIS
DEFENSE IS THEY LOVE TO PLAY
SHELL DEFENSE.
THAT MEANS A LOT OF ZONE.
YOU WANT TO KEEP THE BALL IN
FRONT OF YOU.
WHEN THEY HAVE THE FRONT
THAT THEY HAVE AND HOW
QUICKLY THEY COLLAPSE ON THE
QUARTERBACK, IT IS VERY EASY
TO KEEP HIS EYES ON THE
QUARTERBACK.
WITH THE DEFENSIVE FRONT
WORK.
AL: NIXON BACK TO RECEIVE.
THE LAST PUNT WAS A BEAUTY.
BUT THEN GREEN BAY WENT ALL
THE WAY DOWN THE FIELD.
ON
NOVEMBER 2.
JUST SAYING.
AL: WHAT WERE YOU DOING AT
27?
KIRK: I WAS NOT DOING THIS.
NOT CHASING A SUPER BOWL.
WHAT WERE YOU DOING AT 27?
AL: I WAS DOING THE
CINCINNATI REDS.
WE GOT TO THE WORLD SERIES.
ALL DOWNHILL FROM THERE.
KIRK: WHAT YEAR WAS THAT?
AL: 1972.
THEY LOST THE WORLD SERIES
TO OAKLAND.
I WENT TO THE GIANTS FOR THE
MONEY.
SECOND DOWN AND 4.
LOVE GOES DOWN AT THE 19
YARD LINE.
THE PRESSURE WAS ON.
HE WAS ONE OF THOSE FREE
AGENTS THAT WASHINGTON GOT
IN THE OFF-SEASON TO
SUPPLEMENT THE DEFENSIVE
FRONT.
KIRK: THERE IS VON MILLER.
KEEPING UP WITH WHERE HE HAS
BEEN.
HE WAS WITH BUFFALO LAST
YEAR.
GOOD TO SEE HIM OUT THERE.
STILL ONE OF THE GREAT PASS
RUSHERS THE NFL HAS EVER
HAD.
AL: THIRDHAND -- THIRD AND
14.
NOT ENOUGH TO PICK UP THE
FIRST DOWN.
FOURTH DOWN.
KIRK: VON MILLER COMING UP
WITH A BIG SACK ON SECOND
DOWN.
GETTING THEM BEHIND THE
STICKS HERE.
THE DEFENSE DOES THEIR JOB.
THEY HAVE TO GET THE OFFENSE
GOING FOR THE COMMANDERS.
AGAINST A TOUGH DEFENSE.
AL: THEY ARE WAITING FOR THE
CLOCK TO RUN OUT.
THIS WILL TAKE US TO THE END
OF THE FIRST QUARTER.
ON THIS THURSDAY NIGHT.
GREEN BAY LEADINGTHERE HE IS.
THAT DOMINATED ALL OF THE
FOOTBALL TALK FOR A GOOD
MONTH.
WOULD HE SIGN OR NOT SIGN
HER WITH A TRADE HIM?
THE SECOND QUARTER STARTS
WITH A PUNT.
A FLAG IS DOWN.
NICE RUN BACK.
BY THE ROOKIE OUT OF
VIRGINIA TECH.
KIRK: I THINK WE WILL GET A
FACEMASK HERE ON THE
PACKERS.
AL: DEFINITELY AGAINST THE
PACKERS.
THEY ARE BACKING UP.
BRAD ROGERS HAS HAD OF
FAIRLY BUSY FIRST QUARTER.
PERSONAL FOUL, FACEMASK.
REFEREE: PERSONAL FOUL,
FACEMASK, KICKING TEAM
NUMBER 59.
15 YARD PENALTY TACKED ONTO
THE END OF THE RUN.
KIRK: THE RIGHT HAND PARE
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE
PUNTER.
GOT HIS HAND UP AND PULLED
HIM DOWN.
LETS SEE IF JAYDEN DANIELS
CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
STARTING THIS DRIVE CLOSE TO
MIDFIELD.
IT HAS BEEN A SLOW START FOR
THE COMMANDERS.
LOOKING FOR SOME CONTINUITY.
AL: TO SAY THE LEAST.
SIX PLAYS FOR 11 YARDS.
KIRK: I WOULD NOT BE
SURPRISED TO SEE THEM TRY TO
GET SOME TEMPO GOING.
TRY TO GET THIS AGGRESSIVE
DEFENSE ON ITS HEELS.
AL: WE WILL TALK ABOUT HIM
IN A SECOND.
THE PASS IS TAUGHT BY DEEBO
SAMUEL.
WHO THEY PICKED UP FROM SAN
FRANCISCO.
IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND
10.
KIRK: HE DID A GREAT JOB OF
GETTING OUT THE BLOCKS.
WHAT STOOD OUT LAST WEEK IS
WHAT YOURE SEEING TONIGHT.
GOOD JOB OF GETTING OFF THE
BLOCKS.
LOOK AT ALL THE WHITE
JERSEYS.
THESE GUYS FLY AROUND THE
FOOTBALL.
SHOWING UP WITH BAD
INTENTIONS.
AL: JAYDEN DANIELS IS 4-4
BUT FOR NINE YARDS.
DEEBO SAMUEL GOES OUT OF
BOUNDS.
FOR THE OFFENSIVE
COORDINATOR THIS IS LIKE A
SHINY NEW TOY.
IF HE CAN GET BACK TO WHAT
HE WAS A FEW YEARS AGO IN
SAN FRANCISCO.
KIRK: HE LOOKED GREAT LAST
WEEK.
I DID A GOOD JOB OF MOVING
AROUND.
HE NEEDS SOME HELP.
IF JAYDEN DANIELS AND
MCLAURIN CONTINUE TO WORK
OTHER THE TIME AND, THEY
WILL BE NICE TO HAVE DEEBO
SAMUEL IN THERE.
AL: THIRD DOWN ANDFOUR MAN RUSH, THE PASS IS
FIRED AND IS IT CAUGHT ABOVE
THE GRASS?
IT IS, BY TERRY MCLAURIN.
KIRK: HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO
BE A ROOKIE RIGHT TACKLE,
NOW YOURE MATCHED UP ON THE
RIGHT SIDE AS I WRITE
TACKLE.
HE GOT LUCKY, GOT THE BALL
OUT QUICKLY BEFORE MICAH
PARSONS GOT IN THERE.
AL: GOOD SNAP HERE, DANIELS
IS GOING TO TAKE OFF.
GREAT CIRCLE ROUTE THAT
TIME.
SECOND AND NINE.
KIRK: CONNOR ON THAT RIGHT
SIDE IS A GREAT THING TO
KEEPING AN EYE ON IN ANY
GAME, LET ALONE KEEPING AN
EYE ON MICAH PARSONS.
THEY WILL HAVE TO CHIP TO
HELP THEM OUT.
WE SEEM PARSONS LINE UP ON
THE INSIDE, THAT LAST TIME
THAT LAST THIRD DOWN HE WAS
ON THE OUTSIDE AND WENT
RIGHT BY CONNERLY.
AL: FIRST ROUND PICK OUT OF
OREGON.
PLAY-ACTION.
THATS TIME, SEVENTH ROUND
DRAFT CHOICE, HAS HAD A
CRAZY COLLEGE CAREER AT
ALABAMA STATE.
HE GOES BY THE NAME OF BILL
BUT YOU CAN ALSO CALL HIM
JCF.
KIRK: ITS JUST STRAIGHT UP
BILL.
COLBY WOODEN HAD A GREAT
GAME LAST WEEK, HE NOT THAT
BALL DOWN.
WHAT A GREAT GAME HE HAD
LAST WEEK.
HERE WE GO, MICAH PARSONS.
AL: THIRD DOWN AND NINE.
COVERAGES GOOD AND THE PASS
IS ALSO GOOD, BUT DROPPED.
ALONG THE SIDELINES, NOAH
BROWN HAD IT, COULDNT HOLD
ON.
THIRD DOWN.
KIRK: I THINK THE PACKERS
MAY HAVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH A
HOLD ON THE ROUTE BY NIXON.
BROWN I THINK WAS ABLE TO
BEAT HIM.
NICE JOB OF WORKING HIM ON
THE OUTSIDE, CONTACT THEIR,
I THINK THE PACKERS CAUGHT A
BREAK.
THAT WAS A LOT OF CONTACT
THERE.
THEY TRY TO COME OUT OF IT.
THERE IS PARSONS, GOOD JOB
THAT TIME.
AL: ALREADY HIS THIRD PUNT
OF THE NIGHT.
AND IT WILL BE DOWN AT ABOUT
THE EIGHT YARD LINE.
HE WANTED A FLAG.
DOESNT GET IT.
12:24 REMAINING IN THE HALF.
LOVE AND COMPANY READY TO
START THIS DRIVE FROM THEIR
TERRITORY.
BACK AFTER THIS.
A BIG MATCHUP COMING INTO
THIS GAME, NOT JUST JORDAN
LOVE, BUT THE RECEIVERS WHO
HAVE GROWN UP AROUND HIM.
WE SEEN THE TIME HE HAS TO
BE ABLE TO THROW THE
FOOTBALL, OPENED UP A NICE
VERTICAL SCENE.
THERES A TOUCHDOWN PASS,
THE ONLY TOUCHDOWN OF THE
NIGHT TO DOBBS.
AL: MEANWHILE LOVE GOING
DEEP DOWNFIELD AND A LITTLE
TOO DEEP.
MATTHEW GOLDEN HAS OLYMPIC
SPRINTER SPEED, BUT COULDNT
CATCH UP TO THAT ONE.
KIRK: DOES HE EVER.
HE CAN GO BY ABOUT ANYBODY,
AND THE SAFETY WAS HANGING.
MARTIN DIDNT REALLY
ANTICIPATE THAT GOLDEN MIGHT
GO BY HIM, AND HE DID JUST
THAT.
THE CORNER THOUGHT HE MIGHT
HAVE SOME HELP AT
CENTERFIELD.
HE DID NOT BECAUSE OF THE
SPEED OF GOLDEN.
A LITTLE BIT MORE AIR.
AL: NOT THE LAST TIME IN HIS
CAREER THAT GOLDEN WOULD
DENY THE DEFENSE.
A NINE YARD GAIN HERE FOR
JACOBS, THIRD AND ONE.
KIRK: JORDAN LOVE, WHEN HE
HAS HAD TIME TONIGHT, ANY
QUARTERBACK IS GOOD WHEN HE
HAS TIME, BUT THAT IS
IMPRESSIVE, COMPARED TO THE
PRESSURE WITH ONE SACK AND
ONLY SIX YARDS.
COMMANDERS KNEW THEY HAD TO
DISRUPT THE TIMING BETWEEN
LOVE AND THESE RECEIVERS.
AL: THIRD AND ONE NOW FROM
THE 17.
JACOBS GETS THE FIRST.
TACKLED BY WILL HARRIS.
AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME,
THE GREEN BAY PACKERS HAVE A
TOTAL OF EIGHT FIRST DOWNS
AND A COMMANDERS HAVE ONE.
KIRK: ITS BEEN A PRETTY
DOMINATING PERFORMANCE HERE
IN THIS FIRST HALF.
A LOT OF IT HAS BEEN AT THE
LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, ON BOTH
TIMES OF THE BALL.
GOOD JOB OF PICKING UP THE
SLANT THERE BY THE DEFENSE,
ESPECIALLY THE TIGHT END.
TUCKER HAD THE KEY BLOCK TO
OPEN THAT UP FOR THE FIRST
DOWN.
AL: GOING DEEP AGAIN, DOWN
THE SIDELINE.
THE CATCH IS NOT MADE IN
BOUNDS.
PULLED IN BUT ON THE CHALK.
CAME IN AND PUT THE PRESSURE
ON FROM THE SECONDARY.
CAN HE STAY IN?
INTERESTING.
KIRK: THAT LEFT FOOT, THAT
MIGHT BE A CATCH.
THE RIGHT FOOT IS DOWN.
LOOK AT THE LEFT FOOT.
HES GOT POSSESSION.
THEY ARE GOING TO CHALLENGE
THIS.
THEY SHOULD.
AL: HE WILL THROW THE
CHALLENGE FLAG.
THE CROWD LOVES IT.
TREMENDOUS.
KIRK: THE SPECIAL TEAMS GUY
WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED, BUT
THAT TIME, THE AWARENESS ON
THAT LEFT SIDELINE TO COME
DOWN WITH IT.
AL: FIND OUT AT IS EXPEDITED
OR NOT.
THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR 40
YARDS ON THE PASS.
AFTER REVIEW COME THE
RULING ON THE FIELD IS THEY
COMPLETED CATCH.
FIRST DOWN.
AL: SO INSTEAD OF SECOND AND
10, THAT IS GOOD FOR 37
YARDS.
KIRK: NICE EXPEDITED REVIEW
THERE BY THE CREW.
HOW ABOUT HEATH, JAYDEN REED
GOES DOWN, SO YOURE
WONDERING WHO IS GOING TO
STEP UP?
HEATH TAKING ADVANTAGE OF AN
OPPORTUNITY.
GREAT PLAY.
THE TOUCHDOWN DRIVE WAS A 96
YARD DRIVE, HE COULDVE GONE
90 AGAIN HERE.
AL: IN MOTION, INSIDE
HANDOFF.
STILL FIGHTING HIS WAY TO
HIS SECOND DOWN.
KIRK: THIS IS A VETERAN TEAM
, THEY PICKED UP SOME NEW
PIECES, BUT THIS IS WHERE
YOUD LIKE TO SEE, THIS GAME
IS SO LOPSIDED, IT FEELS A
LOT WORSE.
ITS WHERE BOBBY WEGNER AND
SOME OF THE LEADERS IN THIS
TEAM REALLY HAVE TO START TO
RALLY THE TROOPS AND GET
THEM TO, WHETHER ITS A
TURNOVER, A STOP, SOMEBODY
HAS GOT TO MAKE A PLAY HERE
AND CHANGE THE COMPLEXION OF
THIS FOOTBALL GAME.
AL: IT FEELS LIKE 24-0 IN
THIS BALLGAME.
MOVEMENT OVER THE MIDDLE, TO
THE 25 YARD LINE GOES ROMEO.
HE WANTS TO HEAR IT, AND HE
DOES.
KIRK: MARCHE ANLAGE MOORE,
IN THE OPENING DRIVE, HES
GOT TO BE ABLE TO WORK
THROUGH TRAFFIC.
HE DROPS, INSTEAD OF GOING
WITH DOBBS.
DOBBS HAS A HEAD START ON
THAT LOW CROSSER.
NOT ONLY DOES HE GET A SLOW
START BUT THEN HE HAS TO
WORK THE TRAFFIC TO GET OVER
THERE.
GOOD JOB WITH THE EYES, AND
RECOGNIZING THAT ONCE AGAIN.
AL: HANDOFF HERE.
NOTHING DOING, OF THE LEFT
SIDE, STOP BY ANOTHER GUY
PICKED UP IN THE OFF-SEASON.
IF HES HEALTHY, HES
TERRIFIC.
KIRK: HE WAS DOMINANT LAST
WEEK AGAINST THE GIANTS.
IT MADE A START TO TALK THIS
WEEK ABOUT WHETHER THATS
THE KINLAW WEVE ALL
EXPECTED TO SEE.
THAT TIME HE WAS ABLE TO
SHED THAT BLOCK AND GET IN
THE BACKFIELD.
GREAT PLAY.
AL: BEFORE THAT WITH THE
49ERS.
SECOND DOWN AND 11, ON THE
WASHINGTON 24.
TO THE OUTSIDE, DOES IT
AGAIN.
WHAT NIGHT HE HAS HAD.
AGAIN OF 17, FIRST AND GOAL.
KIRK: MAN-TO-MAN COVERAGE,
AND WHEN YOU ARE ABLE TO
SHAKE A TACKLE AGAINST THE
SAFETY, YOU GOT A LOT OF
ROOM.
HE BLOCKS, THAT TIME HE GETS
OFF A THREE.
BECAUSE OF THE MAN-TO-MAN
COVERAGE, HE HAS A LOT OF
ROOM TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP
FOUR YARDS AFTER THIS
RECEPTION.
GREAT JOB AGAIN BY THE BIG
FELLA, 85.
AL: PICKED UP THIRD YEAR OUT
OF SOUTH DAKOTA STATE.
EIGHT MINUTES LEFT IN THE
HALF.
TO THE ONE.
JOSH JACOBS, FULL WORKLOAD
TONIGHT.
MAKE IT 10 TIMES FOR 32
YARDS.
KIRK: SUCH A BALANCED
OFFENSE.
AL: GIVE IT TO HIM AGAIN,
AND INTO THE END ZONE HE
GOES.
TOUCHDOWN, PACKERS.
SO THEYVE HAD A 96 YARD
DRIVE AND EIGHT 92 YARD
DRIVE.
THEY GO UP BY TWO SCORES.
PACKER FINANCE, MAKE MORE
RESIN -- FANS MAKE MORE
RESERVATIONS.
KIRK: WHAT HE DID IS, HE
JOINED A FRANCHISE THAT WAS
HEADING IN A GREAT DIRECTION
WITH JORDAN LOVE.
AFTER THE AARON RODGERS ERA,
THEYVE HAD TO GO THROUGH
SOME GROWING PAINS.
THIS IS THE YEAR THEY PROVE
THEY CAN PUT IT ALL
TOGETHER.
YOU ADD PARSONS INTO THAT
AND THIS IS A SPECIAL RECIPE
OF WHAT THEY CAN DO.
AL: EXTRA POINT BY MCMANUS
IS GOOD.
HERES THE BIG PLAY ON THE
DRIVE.
THEY
AL: ITS ALWAYS THE SADDEST
SIGHT IN THE FOOTBALL GAME
WHEN THE CART COMES OUT.
D CHURCH WISE, EIGHT YEARS
IN NEW ENGLAND, COMES OVER
TO NEW ENGLAND, GETS HIT
FROM BEHIND ON THE EXTRA
POINT.
HIS NINTH YEAR IN THE
LEAGUE.
A BIG FREE-AGENT PICKUP, HAS
A SUPER BOWL RING, AND
HERES WHAT TOOK PLACE.
KIRK: HES ABLE TO JUMP AND
GET PENETRATION ON THE RIGHT
SIDE OF THAT OFFENSE OF
LINE.
YOU SEE ALL THE WEIGHT CAME
DOWN ON IT.
AL: OF COURSE THE COMMANDERS
KNEW RIGHT AWAY.
EVERYBODY WAS TAKING A KNEE.
THERE IS THE ENTIRE TEAM
RIGHT THERE.
BOBBY WEGNER, THE HEART AND
SOUL OF THAT DEFENSE.
35 YEARS OLD, HE HAS SEEN IT
ALL.
AL: WISES IN HIS FIRST YEAR
WITH THIS TEAM BUT ALMOST
EVERYBODY IN THE CAME CAME
OUT TO HUG HIM, PAT HIM ON
THE HELMET OR THE SHOULDER
AS HE GETS CARTED OFF.
HES ALREADY MADE HIS MARK
WITH THIS TEAM, AND THEN A
SALUTE TO HIS FANS AND BACK
TO HIS TEAM AS WELL.
WE ONLY WISH HIM THE BEST AT
THIS POINT.
KIRK: EVERY SINGLE TEAMMATE
TOUCHED HIM, GAVE HIM THEIR
BEST WITCHES -- WISHES, AND
THE COACH.
AL: MCMANUS TO KICK OFF,
7:30 TO PLAY IN THE FIRST
HALF.
14-0 GREEN BAY IN A GAME
THAT TOTALLY DOMINATED, IF
YOU JUST TUNING IN, THE
PACKERS HAVE 243 TOTAL YARDS
IN THE COMMANDERS HAVE 23.
MCMANUS CENSUS ONE DOWN,
RETURNABLE, FROM THE FIVE
YARD LINE.
WE SAID EARLIER THEY MAKE
THOSE OUT OF CHEESE.
THIS TIME, IT IS OUT OF
WOULD.
-- OUT OF WOOD.
KIRK: HERE IS MICAH PARSONS
COMING IN ON FIRST AND 10.
AL: TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE
DEFENSE.
THE BALL HANDED OFF IN THE
SEVENTH ROUND PICK PICKS UP
ABOUT FIVE.
HE CAME ON IN TRAINING CAMP.
IN FACT HE WAS SO GOOD, IT
HELPED FACILITATE BRIAN
ROBINSON STRAIGHT TO SAN
FRANCISCO.
DANIELS ROLLING, THROWING,
JUGGLED, AND FINALLY CAUGHT,
THAT WAS DANGEROUS.
LOOK LIKE MAYBE AN
INTERCEPTION.
NIXON HIDDEN, FIRST DOWN.
KIRK: COMMANDERS FANS HAVE
BEEN WAITING TO SEE HOW LONG
IT WOULD TAKE FOR DANIELS,
OF COURSE LAST WEEK WE
DIDNT SEE MUCH.
GREAT EFFORT BY 17 TO BRING
THAT ONE IN.
AL: NOW YOU GOT BRANDON
COLEMAN, THE LEFT GUARD, WHO
GOT SHAKEN UP.
CERTAINLY OUT OF
WASHINGTONS OFFENSE WE
EXPECTED A HELLUVA LOT MORE.
KIRK: WE THOUGHT WE WOULD
SEE TWO OFFENSES AGAINST TWO
GREAT DEFENSES.
THE ONE THING ABOUT JAYDEN
DANIELS, IF THEY CAN PUT HER
DRIVE TOGETHER AND GET BACK
INTO IT, ITS IN ONE OF
THOSE OFFENSES THAT CAN
IGNITE AT ANY MOMENT, YOU
KIND OF LIKE TO TURN THAT
SWITCH, BUT NOTHING THEYVE
BEEN ABLE TO DO, IS BECAUSE
THEYRE LOSING THAT BATTLE.
AL: GOING INTO HALFTIME AT
14-7, THATS A VICTORY.
TIMEOUT HERE AS THEY STILL
WORK ON BRANDON COLEMAN.
HES ALREADY THROWN FOR 199
YARDS, AS COLEMAN GOES TO
THE SIDELINE.
CHRIS COLE, NOT OUT OF THE
IN BL -- IN THE NBA,
SPEAKING OF THE NBA, THEY
ARE ON PRIME VIDEO NEXT
MONTH.
KIRK: THEY APPRECIATE THAT.
AL: THEY CERTAINLY DO.
ITS A FIRST DOWN NOW, ONLY
THE SECOND COMMANDERS FIRST
DOWN OF THE GAME.
TO THE OUTSIDE HE GOES, AND
DIVING, UNABLE TO COME UP
WITH IT.
CARRINGTON VALENTINE, SECOND
AND 10.
KIRK: BATTLE THAT LEFT SIDE
OF THE OFFENSE, TUNSIL CAME
OVER FROM HOUSTON, ONE OF
THE BETTER LEFT TACKLES.
MICAH PARSONS, JUST HIS
PRESENCE MAKES DANIELS AWARE
OF IT.
THE PACKERS KNOW ITS HARD
TO GET THE BALL DOWNFIELD.
THEY EXPECT THE BALL TO COME
OUT QUICK.
AL: SECOND AND 10, IN THE
POCKET.
THAT IS CAUGHT, AND CAN HE
GET THE FIRST DOWN?
A LITTLE SHY.
NOAH BROWN WILL GO INTO
COMMANDOS -- COMMANDERS LORE
AS THE GUY INVOLVED IN THAT
INSANE PASS LAST YEAR.
KIRK: HERES THIS TEMPO
AGAIN.
AL: GOING TO THE HUDDLE, CAN
THEY PICK UP THE FIRST?
YES THEY CAN.
WE WILL CALL HIM JCM OR BILL
FROM NOW.
KIRK: THEY WANT TO PLAY A
LOT OF ZONE COVERAGE.
THEY WANT TO FORCE THE
COMMANDERS TO HAVE TO RUN
THE FOOTBALL OR THROW THE
FOOTBALL UNDERNEATH AND GET
THE YARDS AFTER THE CATCH.
SO FAR, UNABLE TO DO THAT.
AL: 3RD AND 8.
THE MEN WHO LED THIS TEAM IN
RUSHING LAST YEAR, COOPER
MAKES THE STOP.
KIRK: THE DEFENSIVE
COORDINATOR IS DOING A GREAT
JOB IN HIS SECOND YEAR.
YOU CAN SEE THE PLAYERS ARE
MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE AND
UNDERSTANDING THIS GAME.
HE UNDERSTANDS A PLAYERS
PAIR HE HAS AN ABILITY TO BE
VERY CREATIVE, THE SKIES
COVERAGES.
ALREADY A DEFENSE THAT HAS A
LOT OF PIECES TO BE ABLE TO
PUT TOGETHER ONE OF THE TOP
DEFENSES IN THIS LEAGUE.
AL: 2ND AND 5.
PLAY CLOCK AT 2.
YOU TELL ME THAT ANYBODY IN
AMERICA WAS HAPPIER THAN
JEFF APPELLEE WHEN THAT
TRADE WAS MADE.
KIRK: HE WAS ECSTATIC.
NIXON SITTING ON THE SHORT
ROUTES.
LOOK AT HIM, HES NOT LOSING
ANY GROUND, AND ALLOWS HIM
TO COME UP AND NOT THE BALL
AWAY.
NOT JUST PARSONS BUT THE
WHOLE GROUP, ITS VERY HARD
ON A QUARTERBACK TO SIT BACK
THERE COMFORTABLY AND WAIT
FOR THE DEEPER ROUTS.
AL: DANIELS IS EIGHT OUT OF
12 AFTER ONLY 43 YARDS.
ABOUT 3.5 YARDS PER PASS.
HANGS IN THE POCKET, DEEP
DOWNFIELD, AND INCOMPLETE.
COVERED THEREBY NATE HOBBS,
WHO HAS BEEN INJURED.
FOURTH DOWN.
KIRK: THEY RUSH FORWARD AND
THEN THEY PLAY MAN TO MAN.
ITS GREAT TO SEE NATE HOBBS
BACK IN THE LINEUP.
HES BEEN DEALING WITH SOME
INJURIES AT CAM, HAD A KNEE
INJURY.
ALLOWS HIM TO BE ABLE TO
PLAY MAN TO MAN ON THIRD
DOWN SITUATIONS.
AL: MATT GAY TO TRY TO PUT
THEM ON THE BOARD.
51 YARD KICK IN THE NFL
TODAY IS ALMOST A CHIP SHOT.
OF COURSE IT IS GOOD.
THEYTOUGH LAST WEEK AGAINST
THESE COMMANDERS.
AL: LOVES HIS NEW YORK AS
WELL.
GAY TO KICK RIGHT NOW.
4:27 TO GO.
JUST KICKED A 51 YARDER,
MATT GAY.
EMANUEL WILSON BACK TO
RECEIVE.
IT WILL BE COACHED
THESE TWO TEAMS, SO DID
CURLY LAMBEAU.
OF COURSE THE STADIUM NAMED
AFTER CURLY LAMBEAU.
WILLIAMS TO THE OUTSIDE.
SIX RUSHING TOUCHDOWNS, SIX
RECEIVING TOUCHDOWNS WITH
TCU.
KIRK: A LITTLE BIT OF
CONFUSION, MISDIRECTION.
HE HANDS IT 83 AND THANKS UP
THE MIDDLE, ENOUGH TO HOLD
THE DEFENSE.
GOOD LOCKS ON THE OUTSIDE.
A GREAT CATCH EARLIER AND
TUCKER KRAFT GETTING AROUND
WITH A NICE BLOCK AFTER ALL.
A BIG SERIES FOR THE
COMMANDERS DEFENSE.
DEFER, GET THE BALL TO START
THE SECOND HALF.
THE WAY THIS GAME HAS GONE,
THEY ARE PRETTY FORTUNATE.
AL: ABSOLUTELY.
SECOND DOWN AND TWO.
TO THE OUTSIDE, A NICE
LITTLE MOVE THERE.
FLAG IS THROWN.
HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER
86.
10 YARD PENALTY.
AL: JOHNS -- JOHN
FITZPATRICK, THAT MOVES THE
BALL BACK.
THE CURLY LAMBEAU THING WAS
SO INTERESTING, HOW MANY
PEOPLE KNEW THAT?
JOSH HARRIS CAME UP AND TALK
TO ME, THE OWNER OF THE
WASHINGTON COMMANDERS.
HE DIDNT KNOW THAT.
KIRK: I TOOK A WALK LAST
NIGHT AND I STOPPED BY THE
STATUES AND I SAW BOTH
STATUES AND READ UP ON THEM.
HE WAS BORN IN 1898, COACH
IN THE 1920S AND 1930S.
HOW ABOUT THE JOB JOSH
HARRIS AND PETERS HAVE DONE?
AL: THEY LOVED HIM RIGHT OFF
THE BAT.
SECOND DOWN AND 12.
IF LOADER THERE IS CAUGHT
AND TAKEN TO THE 25 YARD
LINE.
BOBBY WEGNER, OF COURSE HE
PLAYED IN SEATTLE, DAN QUINN
WAS HIS DEFENSIVE
COORDINATOR THE TWO SUPER
BOWLS THEY PLAY BACK TO
BACK.
THERES A MINUTE PLAYED
ALMOST EVERY SNAP LAST
SEASON AND SO FAR TONIGHT.
KIRK: WE ASKED ABOUT HIS
WORKOUT REGIMEN, YOU NAME
IT, HE IS DOING IT TO TRY TO
KEEP HIS BODY RIGHT.
VERY INTENTIONAL ABOUT
KEEPING HEALTHY AND BEING
ABLE TO PLAY AT THE LEVEL HE
PLAYS AT.
IN HIS 14TH YEAR, 35 YEARS
OF AGE.
AL: LOVE UNDER PRESSURE,
SIGNALS DOWNFIELD, GOING FOR
IT ALL, AND INCOMPLETE.
A LITTLE JOSTLING GOING ON
DOWNFIELD.
DOBBS AND LATTIMORE, FOURTH
AND 11.
KIRK: YOU GO BACK TO THAT
HOLDING BY JOHN FITZPATRICK.
IF HE DOESNT HAVE THAT
HOLDING CALL, PLENTY OF TIME
TO BE ABLE TO GET POINTS ON
THE BOARD.
THE COMMANDERS CATCH A BREAK
WITH THAT.
INSTEAD OF POTENTIALLY 17-3,
21-3, NOT ONLY DO THEY GET
THE STOP, NOW THEY GET THE
BALL DOWN WAS STILL 2:14 TO
GO AND STILL A CHANCE TO PUT
POINTS ON THE BOARD
THEMSELVES.
AL: SECOND PUNT OF THE
NIGHT, FIRST ONE FOR 54
YARDS.
BACKING UP, 19 YARD LINE.
DYLANTALKED ABOUT HOW DANIELS HAS
DEALT WITH THIS PASS
RUSHING, HES ONLY HAD TWO
ATTEMPTS OVER 10 YARDS IN
THE AIR.
AL: FINAL PLAY BEFORE THE
TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
DANIELS KEEPING IT, OUT OF
BOUNDS A LITTLE SHY OF THE
FIRST DOWN.
TAKES US TO THE TWO-MINUTE
WARNING WITH 1:55 TO GO IN
THE HALF.
AND THE PACKERS UP BY 11 AT
ALF, SHERM
WILL BE HONORED.
HIS NAME WILL GO UP ON THE
FACADE HERE.
MEANWHILE IT SECOND DOWN AND
TWO, THE COMMANDERS AT THE
49 YARD LINE.
ENOUGH FOR THE FIRST DOWN
HERE, AUSTIN EKELERS.
KIRK: WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY
HERE, GREAT EXAMPLE OF
WEATHERING THE STORM.
EVERYTHING THAT COULD HAVE
GONE WRONG, HAS.
AL: INSIDE HERE, ABOUT FIVE
YARDS.
EKELER, HIS SECOND DOWN.
KEEP THAT CLOCK RUNNING.
KIRK: SAM COSBY NOT STARTING
, PLAYING WITH TWO BACKUP
GUARDS.
AL: SECOND AND FIVE.
THE PERFECT SCENARIO FOR
THESE GUYS WOULD BE TO SCORE
AND LEAVE GREEN BAY WITH NO
TIME ON THE CLOCK.
KIRK: THATS RIGHT.
NOT TO CONTINUE TO BEAT THIS
TO DEATH, BUT ITS THE
LITTLE THINGS THAT IMPACT
THE GAME.
TUNSIL HAS THE CROWD NOISE,
AND LOOK AT WHO IS ACROSS
FROM HIM.
HE WANTS TO GET THE EARLY
START ON A PASS RUSH.
AL: TUNSIL IS NO STRANGER TO
THAT CALL.
KIRK: THATS A GRIZZLED
VETERAN, AND STILL, HE HAS
TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING THAT
HEAD START.
AL: MOST VETERANS ARE
GRIZZLED.
SECOND AND 10, UNDERNEATH,
SOME BLOCKING THEIR.
FOR SAMUEL, HE GETS INTO THE
ACTION HERE.
THIRD AND FOUR.
KIRK: 40 SECONDS, ALL THREE
TIMEOUT PERIODS -- ALL THREE
TIMEOUTS.
SEE IF DEEBO SAMUEL CAN MAKE
A PLAY HERE, TRY TO FIND
SOME SPACE.
AL: COMES BACK TO THE RIGHT,
NOW HES GOING TO GO DEEP
DOWN.
ITS BATTED DOWN ALONG THE
SIDELINE.
MATTS IT AWAY, FOURTH DOWN
-- BATS IT AWAY.
KIRK: MANY ATTRIBUTES THAT
PARSONS HAS.
THATS WHY GUYS LIKE TUNSIL
WANT TO GET THAT HEAD START
BEFORE HE IS ABLE TO GO BY
HIM.
THERE HE IS AGAIN, SMILING
OVER AT PARSONS, LIKE IM
GETTING CLOSE.
AL: THERE IS GAY, WHOS
GOING TO TRY A 58 YARD FIELD
GOAL.
LAST ONE WAS GOOD FOR 51.
THIS ONE IS NO GOOD.
THAT LEAVES 14 SECONDS ON
THE CLOCK AND GIVES GREEN
BAY A CHANCE TO TRY TO GET
INTO FIELD GOAL RANGE OR
BETTER.
KIRK: THE OPERATION THERE
LOOK PRETTY GOOD, GOOD SNAP,
GOOD HOLD.
THERES THE PACKER BENCH
GOING, NO GOOD.
YOUVE GOT ALL THREE
TIMEOUTS.
NOT LIKE YOU WILL GET TO USE
ALL THREE WITH 14 SECONDS.
ESPECIALLY WITH MCMANUS, WHO
HAS BEEN TERRIFIC IN FIELD
GOAL RANGE.
KIRK: THERES DEFINITELY AN
OPPORTUNITY HERE.
THEYVE HAD A TON OF YARDS,
LETS SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO
HERE.
AL: THROW, ON THE SIDELINES,
OUT OF BOUNDS GOES OCTAVIAN
WICKS.
THE CLOCK STOPPED, EIGHT
SECONDS NOW ON A 14 YARD
GAIN.
KIRK: COMFORTABLE RHYTHM
THERE BY JORDAN LOVE, MOVED
A BIT TO HIS RIGHT IN THE
POCKET, GOT HIS FEET UNDER
HIM.
RIGHT WHERE IT NEEDED TO BE
TO GET OUT OF BOUNDS.
AL: LOOKING FOR THAT 55 YARD
FIELD CALLED ATTEMPT IF THEY
DONT GAIN A YARD HERE.
AND HE DOES.
THEY WILL TAKE THE TIMEOUT
HERE.
JOSH JACOBS TAKING IT DOWN
TO THE 31 YARD LINE.
TIMEOUT TAKEN.
MCMANUS HAS HAD A REALLY
GOOD CAREER, MOST OF THE
TIME OF COURSE WITH DENVER.
KIRK: THIS GIVES YOU AN IDEA
ABOUT JOSH JACOBS.
JUST THE AWARENESS, TALK
ABOUT HIS LEADERSHIP,
ACCOUNTABILITY.
THERE HE IS, MAKING SURE THE
TIMEOUT IS MADE.
AL: MATT WILL SNAP IT.
ONLY TWO GUYS ON THIS ROSTER
OVER 30.
48 YARD ATTEMPTE IS NO GOOD.
COMMANDERS TO GET THE BALL.
MCMANUS SENDS IT DOWN TO THE
SEVEN.
THIS IS DEEBO SAMUEL.
SAMUEL BREAKS LOOSE.
PASS THE 40, INTO GREEN BAY
TERRITORY.
THATS EXACTLY WHAT
WASHINGTON WAS LOOKING FOR
TO START THE SECOND HALF.
MEANWHILE CALEB LEFLORE.
WHAT HAS BEEN THE KEY TO
THEIR EXECUTION?
EVERYBODYS DOING THEIR
JOB.
SO UNFORTUNATELY, WE SHOULD
HAVE MORE POINTS THAN WE DO
RIGHT NOW.
WEVE HAD A COUPLE OF
CRITICAL ERRORS, WEVE HAD
20 -- 20 PENALTIES, WE CANT
DO THAT TO OURSELVES.
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO TO
LIMIT ONE OF THE MOST
DYNAMIC QUARTERBACKS IN THE
LEAGUE?
WE HAVE TO TAKE IT ONE
PLAY AT A TIME.
IS GOING TO TAKE THAT
RELENTLESS ENERGY AND EFFORT
THROUGH THE SECOND HALF.
AL: WASHINGTON STARTS WITH A
50 YARD RUN BACK FROM SAMUEL
IN THE FIRST PLAY IS A FIVE
YARD GAIN FROM THE ROOKIES,
SECOND DOWN AND FIVE.
KIRK: THEY START IN PLUS
TERRITORY.
ITS BEEN A TOP FIRST HALF.
WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE JOB
THIS GREEN BAY DEFENSE HAS
DONE, THEY PLAYED A TON OF
ZONE AND WINNING UP FRONT AT
THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
AL: SECOND AND SIX.
INCOMPLETE.
THIRD AND 6.
KIRK: ITS BEEN INTERESTING
TO SEE MICAH PARSONS EMBRACE
LUKAS VAN NESS WHO ENDED UP
TAKING HIS JOB, LOOK AT THIS
KID COME OFF HEREBY 90.
THATS A RUNNING START.
COMING OUT OF IOWA, HIS
THIRD YEAR AS A FIRST
ROUNDER, STARTING TO KIND OF
TURN IT LOOSE.
THE GOOD THING ABOUT PARSONS
HERE, BOTH ON THE FIELD
TOGETHER, AND PASSING
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS RIGHT
HERE.
AL: PLAYED ABOUT HALF THE
SNAPS LAST WEEK, PROBABLY IN
THAT AREA TONIGHT.
THIRD DOWN AND SIX FROM THE
40 YARD LINE.
KIRK: A LOT OF ZONE, A LOT
OF JUST TRUSTING THE FRONT
TO GET THE PRESSURE AND
CORRAL DANIELS, JUST
SCRAMBLE THAT FIRST DOWN.
AL: STACKED ON THE LEFT
SIDE.
SHOWED BLITZ FOR A SECOND,
BACK OFF, THEY COME AGAIN,
DANIELS UNDER PRESSURE, AT
THE 31 YARD LINE, OVER THE
MIDDLE.
COMPLETES THE SACK TO ZACH
ERTZ, LONG TIME TIGHT END,
13 YEARS IN THE NATIONAL
FOOTBALL LEAGUE.
KIRK: YOU SAW HIM LOOK BACK
AND SAY WEVE GOT PRESSURE
HERE, GOOD JOB, THE DELAYED
BLITZ IN SUB NOT REALLY
IMPACTING JAYDEN DANIELS.
ENOUGH TIME THERE ON THIRD
DOWN TO GET THAT FIRST.
AL: TO THE 31 OF THE
PACKERS.
THATS HIS NICKNAME, HE
LOVES IT.
THAT.
WALKER MAKES THE STOP.
KIRK: ECKLER IS MORE OF A
THIRD DOWN BACK IN THIS
STAGE OF HIS CAREER.
THE ROOKIE OUT OF ARIZONA.
A GUY THAT CAN TAKE SOME OF
THE PRESSURE OFF HIS PASSING
GAME  STARTED AT ALABAMA
STATE.
THE PASS TO THE OUTSIDE IS
CAUGHT THEY ARE WEARING
THEIR WHITE JERSEYS.
ITS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE
DONE A NIGHT GAME.
PERFECT FOOTBALL WEATHER.
USUALLY IT IS 30 DEGREES.
PERFECT.
ABSOLUTELY.
THIRD AND THREE.
THE PLAY CLOCK AT ONE.
AND PARSONS GETS IN THERE.
CIRCLED THE MATCHUP
KNOWING THEY MAY TRY TO HELP
HIM BUT THEY LEFT HIM ON AN
ISLAND AGAINST MICAH
PARSONS.
TOUGH ON ANYBODY BUT
ESPECIALLY A ROOKIE.
GETS TOO FAR TO THE OUTSIDE
BECAUSE OF THE RESPECT HE
HAD FOR HIS SPEED HE THOUGHT
HE MIGHT BE JUMPING IN ALL
THE ROOKIE COULD DO WAS
GRAB.
STILL DID NOT REALLY MATTER.
THE PENALTY IS DECLINED.
TO MAKE IT FOURTH DOWN.
THEY HAVE CHOSEN THIS
OPTION.
AND GIVES WASHINGTON THE
CHANCE TO PICK A FIELD GOAL
SO MATT HAS ALREADY BANGED
AND ONE FROM 51.
NO GOOD.
MIAMI WILL TRY TO REBOUND AS
THEY TAKE ON NEW ENGLAND.
MIAMI AT BUFFALO.
PARSONS.
AND HE GOES BACK TO PASS AND
ITS CAUGHT AT THE 35 YARD
LINE.
SINCE THAT IN TO LUKE
MUSGRAVE.
HE GETS AN OPPORTUNITY
HERE.
WATCH HIM WORK ON THIS.
HE WILL IMPACT THE SAFETY
BEFORE HE WORKS TO THE
OUTSIDE A HESITATION MOVE.
ABLE TO GET GREAT SEPARATION
AND IN FACT TURN THE SAFETY
AROUND.
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME THE
COMMANDERS SIT BACK WITH A
SAFETY LOOK THEY DO THAT.
OVER 200 YARDS PASSING
AGAINST THAT LOOK  HE GETS
HIT AS HE THROWS.
THROWS IT OUT OF BOUNDS.
THAT TIME QUAN MARTIN TO
FORCE IT.
YOU FEEL JOE WHITT WILL
HAVE TO MIX IT UP USUALLY
BASED ON WHAT THEY DID LAST
WEEK THEY ARE CONFIDENT THEY
THINK THEY CAN GET HOME BUT
THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE
TONIGHT WITH THE INJURY.
YOU WILL SEE HIM TRY TO LOOK
FOR WAYS TO DISRUPT THIS
TIMING.
THEN HE IS ABLE TO PUT THE
BALL WHERE HE WANTS TO.
HIS FOCUS IS TRYING TO THROW
ON PLATFORM.
INSIDE.
SPLIT BY JACOBS.
JOHN BAPTISTE MAKING THE
TACKLE.
PUT IT ON THE LINE.
FIRST DOWN.
THAT IS A BALL THAT WAS
INTENDED TO BOUNCE.
HE HAS SUCH GOOD VISION AND
FEEL FOR THAT.
HE IS SO PATIENT.
THERE YOU GO.
ORIGINALLY IT IS CALLED A
FIRST DOWN.
THEY SAY HE IS SHORT.
WHICH MEANS INSTEAD OF FIRST
AND 10 THEY ARE GOING TO
MAKE IT THIRD AND ONE.
THEY INSIDE ABOUT A YARD.
GREAT VISION AS ALWAYS FROM
JACOBS.
SO TOUGH WITH HIS LEVERAGE.
PUMP FAKE.
WIDE OPEN TO THE OUTSIDE.
AND ONCE AGAIN IT GOES TO
MUSGRAVE.
MAKES THE TACKLE.
FIRST DOWN OF THE YARD LINE.
YOU WONDER IF THIS
DEFENSE IS FATIGUED.
THERES JUST A LATE REACTION
WITH THE TIGHT END THAT ENDS
UP GOING OVER IN MOTION.
MADE IT VERY EASY.
THIRD AND SHORT.
THE SECOND OR THIRD TIME WE
HAVE SEEN THE SECONDARY
REACT PRETTY SLOWLY.
ON THE GROUND AGAIN.
JACOBS THROWS.
FLAG DOWN AT THE 14 YARD
LINE.
BRAD ROGERS SIGNALS IT IS
AGAINST GREEN BAY.
HOLDING, OFFENSE, NUMBER
75.
PENALTY.
FIRST DOWN.
LEFLORE ACTUALLY COACHED
UNDER HIM FOR TWO YEARS.
AT ATLANTA.
HE SAID IT WAS
LIFE-CHANGING TO SEE.
COULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN MORE
HIGHLY ABOUT HIM.
HE TALKED ABOUT HAVING
FUN BUT AT THE SAME TIME
BEING FOCUSED AND BEING ABLE
TO FIND THE BALANCE.
IT CAN BE TRICKY.
FOR HIM TO SAY LIFE-CHANGING
SAYS IT ALL.
YEAH.
FIRST AND 20.
ANOTHER FLAG HERE.
HE REALLY MEANT
LIFE-CHANGING.
THE GREETING BETWEEN THE TWO
OF THEM BEFORE THE GAME.
THAT TELLS YOU EVERYTHING.
NO DOUBT.
OF COURSE, HE COACHED
RICHARD SHERMAN AND COMPANY.
AND LOST TO NEW ENGLAND IN
THE SUPER BOWL.
HE FIRES.
OPEN.
INSIDE THE 20.
SO IT WAS FIRST AND 25.
MAKES THE SECOND DOWN.
THIS IS LIKE A FORM OF A
TAMPA TWO.
A LINE DRIVE -- LINEBACKER
DROPS THROUGH THE MIDDLE AND
YOU OPEN OF A CREASE.
THAT VERTICAL THREAT AND A
GOOD JOB OF BEING PATIENT BY
JORDAN LOVE.
THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
ATTACK THESE VERTICALS.
MAKING HIS DEFENSE PAY FOR
IT.
A TIGHT FORMATION.
SECOND AND SIX.
THE BIG MAN.
JACOBS.
THAT IS GOING TO BE FIRST
DOWN.
THEY HAD A FIRST AND 25
THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO
OVERCOME AND GET THAT FIRST
DOWN.
REALLY TRYING TO WEAR DOWN
THIS DEFENSE.
ALREADY TRAILING 14-3.
NOW TRYING TO LEAN ON THEM.
AND ALSO RUNNING THE BALL
WITH JACOBS.
REMEMBER 8.5 YARDS PER
PLAY.
THIS IS PLAY NUMBER 41.
PRESSURE.
LOOKING DOWN FIELD.
THROWS IT AWAY TO MAKE IT
SECOND AND GOAL.
SO JORDAN LOVE, ITS
INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU SEE
SOMEBODY LIKE MCCARTHY THE
OTHER NIGHT OR DANIELS LAST
YEAR STARTING RIGHT AWAY AS
THEY START THEIR CAREERS.
PEOPLE LIKE AARON RODGERS
BEHIND BRETT FAVRE HAD TO
WAIT.
IN HE SAID IT WAS A GREAT
EXPERIENCE TO PLAY BEHIND
AARON RODGERS.
EVERY STORY IS DIFFERENT
BUT I LOVE THE FACT THAT HE
TURNED THAT INTO A POSITIVE
AND SAID WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY
TO LEARN FROM ONE OF THE
BEST TO EVER DO IT.
IT WAS MY TURN AND I WAS
READY TO GO.
SECOND AND GOAL.
JACOBS TO THE OUTSIDE.
THEY STOP HIM.
MARTIN IS THERE.
HE SAID HE LEARNED LITTLE
THINGS LIKE THE PREPARATION
AND INTENSITY AND REALLY
GREW.
AND HE WAS THEN AND HE WAS
THEN IN A GREAT SPOT.
JUST LIKE DANIELS.
SO EACH SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES
CAN BE DIFFERENT.
AND IT IS DEFINITELY PAYING
OFF FOR HIM.
A LOT OF GUYS WOULD NOT
HANDLE IT THAT WAY.
THATS RIGHT.
THIRD DOWN FOR BOTH
TEAMS.
THIRD AND GOAL.
AT THE FOUR.
DRIFTS TO THE LEFT.
HOOKS THAT WAY.
IN THIS ONE HE THROWS AWAY.
THEY NEEDED TO HOLD THEM TO
A FIELD GOAL AND THAT IS
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE YOUR
MATT LAFLEUR MUSTVE SEEN
SOMETHING HE DIDNT LIKE.
HE WAS TRYING TO GET THE
OFFICIALS ATTENTION.
BUT TO NO AVAIL.
IT WAS SNAPPED AFTER THAT.
GOOD VERTICAL JUMP.
NOT BAD AT ALL.
22 YARD FIELD GOAL.
PUTS IT DOWN AND THAT KICK
IS GOOD BY NOT MUCH.
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A CITY
LOSE TWO SUPERSTARS LIKE
THAT IN THEIR PRIME.
SAMUEL WILL RUN IT OUT.
WE WERE TALKING TO PARSONS.
HE SAID THEY GAVE ME A BIG
TRUCK AND I GOT AN AIR B&amp;B.
AND IM MEETING AT TEXAS
ROADHOUSE.
I SAID YOU WERE NOT GOING TO
GET THERE.
IF YOU ARE NOT AS IF YOU ARE
IF FAN AND YOU HAVE NEVER
BEEN HERE YOU NEED TO VISIT.
A GAIN OF ABOUT EIGHT.
LETS GO TO KAYLEE.
HE SEES THE SAME PARALLELS.
HE SAID THERE IS NOTHING
MORE MOTIVATING.
HE SAID THERES NOTHING MORE
MOTIVATING.
HE LOOKED PRETTY
MOTIVATED.
APPROACHING THE PRIME OF HIS
CAREER.
LIKE SECOND DOWN AND THREE.
THIRD DOWN.
WITH ALL THE TALK ABOUT
PARSONS, A LOT OF THE THINGS
THAT GET LOST OR THE OTHER
PIECES.
THESE LINEBACKERS ARE NO
LONGER HESITATING.
AND THEY PLAY WITH GREAT
LENGTH AND COMMUNICATION.
THIRD DOWN AND THREE.
INCOMPLETE.
WE JUST TALKED ABOUT HIM.
HE MAKES HIS PRESENCE FELT.
AND ITS NOT ALWAYS PARSONS.
IT IS YOU HOW DO YOU IMPACT
DANIELS.
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT THROUGH
THE ENTIRE FIRST HALF THE
BALL HAS TO COME OUT FAST.
IT MAKES IT TOUGHER THE
QUARTERBACK  THE TACKLES
-- THE PACKERS NOW IN 6.5
QUARTERS.
FOURTH PUNT OF THE NIGHT.
SMOTHER RIGHT AWAY.
OUT OF PLAY.
SO SAYS BRAD ROGERS.
HOLDING.
ALMOST 10 YARDS.
HES OVER 100 RECEIVING.
A GOOD JOB FOR A GUY THAT IS
260 POUNDS.
HE STARTS THIS DRIVE.
QUOTES JACOBS.
HIS 16TH CARRY FOR 61 YARDS.
THE TWO TIMES THEY HAVE
STARTED TO DRIVE INSIDE
THEIR OWN 10 YARD LINE, THE
RESULTS OF BOTH HAVE BEEN
TOUCHDOWNS.
ITS NOT A FULL MOON.
ONE OF OUR FAVORITE GUYS.
JACOBS PICKS UP A YARD.
I SAW THE MOVIE I THOUGHT
ABOUT THIS GAME.
IT WAS A FULL MOON.
CLOSE ENOUGH.
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?
I SAID PEOPLE LANDED ON THE
MOON?
WHAT A NIGHT AND DAY THAT
WAS.
FABULOUS SHOT.
HE GETS IT AWAY.
STILL DOING THE JOB.
THEY HAD A LOT OF BODIES
OF SCRIMMAGE.
MILLER ENDED UP COMING OUT
THE EDGE LATE WEGNER ABLE TO
COME FOR IT. AND THE DEFENSE
DOES THEIR JOB.
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT DAN
QUINN TOLD KAYLEE THEY ARE
KIND OF LIKE A BOXER.
THEY COULD GET WITHIN A
POSSESSION.
OFF THE ROPES.
39 YARD LINE.
ANXIETY IT.
LAYING IN A ROOKIE OUT OF
VIRGINIA TECH 3.5 REMAINING
IN THE THIRD QUARTER.
17-3, GREENTREMENDOUS BALANCE.
THE BEND HAS A LOT TO DO
WITH THAT.
A GREAT DEMO.
DOWN THE SIDELINE AND
INCOMPLETE.
THEY WENT EMPTY TRYING TO
SPREAD THIS DEFENSE OUT.
SOMEBODY HAS TO MAKE A PLAY.
ITS BEEN TOUGH TO GET THE
BALL DOWNFIELD.
WE HAVE NOT SEEN MANY SHOTS.
BUT HE HAS A HARD TIME
LOCATING THE BALL.
THAT IS WHY BROWN HAD A
CHANCE BY JUMPING LIKE
SECOND AND 10.
FIRED OVER THE MIDDLE.
THAT IS COMPLETE.
TACKLED BY COOPER TWO YARDS
SHY.
13TH YEAR OUT OF
STANFORD.
ABOUT A YARD AND A HALF.
TRYING TO BURROW HIS WAY.
TACKLED BY WILLIAMS.
INITIALLY A LITTLE BIT
SHORT.
THERE IT IS.
SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN.
EVERYBODY WONDERED WHAT
WOULD THIS DEFENSE BE ABLE
TO DO.
THIS TIME HE AFFECTED THAT
PLAY.
FOURTH.
CAN THEY CONVERT?
IT WAS NOT EASY.
BUT HES ABLE TO PICK UP
THOSE INCHES.
THAT TOOK A SECOND, THIRD
AND FOURTH FOR FROM ECKLER
BECAUSE OF THE PUSH.
LOOK AT THAT JOB OF GETTING
BACK.
ECKLER CONTINUED TO BE A
DRIVE.
DANIELS GOING DOWN.
ROCHON DAIRY.
AND A GUY WHO IS HAVING A
BIG TIME SEASON ON THE
DEFENSIVE FRONT.
HE WILL GET MANY MORE
OPPORTUNITIES AND CHANCES.
THIS IS AGAINST THIS POOR
ROOKIE WHO HAS BEEN EDUCATED
IN THE NFL.
THEY GUY WHO PLAYED LEFT
TACKLE IN COLLEGE.
OVER THE MIDDLE.
NICE WEAPON.
TO GET SOME POSITIVE YARDS
AND A CHANCE.
YOU ARE DOWN 14.
THE AIR TO BE THINKING OF A
COUPLE PLACE TO GET THIS
DOWN.
A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF A
MINUTE TO GO IN THE THIRD.
SPREAD IT OUT.
PRESSURE.
EXTRA MAN COMING.
SHORT AND INCOMPLETE.
COOPER THAT TIME FORCING IT
UP THE MIDDLE.
DOING A GOOD JOB OF
MIXING UP.
MADE JAYDEN DANIELS HAVE TO
GET RID OF THE BALL QUOTES
DOWN BY 14.
22 REMAINING IN THE THIRD.
FOURTH AND SEVEN.
STRAIGHT DROP.
DANIELS THROWS.
RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THAT
ROUTE IS WHERE THE FLAG CAME
IN  COVERING ON THE PLAY.
HE WAS ON THE INJURED LIST.
COURTS THERE IS A HOLD.
TO BE ABLE TO COME OUT OF
THE BREAK, GOOD CALL BY THE
OFFICIALS.
SO THEY WILL PICK UP THE
DOWN.
AND THEY RUN THE CLOCK
THATS EIGHT PENALTIES ON
GREEN BAY TONIGHT.
AND THAT WWE START THE FOURTH QUARTER.
FROM THE GREEN BAY 32.
LOOK OUT.
PARSONS GOT HIM FROM BEHIND.
MICAH PARSONS AGAINST THE
ROOKIE.
YOU SEE 26 THERE.
LOOK AT HIM GET OUT.
LIKE HE WAS SEAN OUT OF A
GUN.
SO FAST AND POWERFUL.
AND A HEADS UP PLAY BY
DANIELS.
SO THIRD DOWN AND NINE.
AND NOW YOU HAVE GOT
TIMEOUT.
THIS PACKERS DEFENSE.
YOU LOOK ACROSS THE ENTIRE
NFL.
HES A DIFFERENCE MAKER.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE
PIECES THAT HAVE, THERE IS A
LOT TO LOVE ABOUT WHAT THEY
ARE DOING, THE WAY THEY ARE
ABLE TO PRESSURE THE
QUARTERBACK, TO PLAY ZONES.
THEY MIX IN SOME THINGS THAT
CREATE SOME CONFUSION.
DANIELS WITH FOUR SCRAMBLES.
15 YARDS AND NO FIRST DOWNS.
THEY DONT HAVE TO PLAY A
TON OF MAN.
THEY ARE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR
EYES ON IT.
THIRD AND NINE.
ALMOST TRIPLE-TEAMED HIM.
THE PASS IS CAUGHT.
THEY FOUND A SOFT SPOT IN
THE ZONE.
HE WAS ABLE TO GET THE BALL
OUT WITH THIRD DOWN AND
PARSONS ON HIS RIGHT.
HE KNOWS IT HAS TO GET OUT
IN A HURRY.
SAMUEL WIDENS THE CORNER,
GIVES THEM A SPOT.
SPINS AWAY PROTECTED
WELL.
CAUGHT.
FIRST DOWN.
MOORE TRYING TO GET TO THE
END ZONE.
AND HE DOES.
PACKERS TOUCHDOWN.
11 PLAYS, 50 YARDS TO MAKE
IT A ONE POSITION GAME.
WHAT A PLAY THE DESIGN
HERE.
WATCH WHERE HE COMES.
YOU WILL SEE HIM PATIENTLY
WAIT.
HE GOES DOWN THE LEFT SIDE
LINE AND SLIPS OUT, MAKES
THE GUY MISS.
WHAT A PLAY.
RAN BY WALKER.
BANGS IT THROUGH.
AND SO THE COMMANDERS
SOMEHOW ARE WITHIN SEVEN
POINTS.
OK.
17-10.
BACKING UP INTO THE END
ZONE.
SO TONIGHT IS THE WHITE
UNIFORMS.
THIS CROWD WILL ALL
FOLLOW THEIR INSTRUCTIONS.
EVERYBODY SHOWS UP IN THEIR
WHITE.
DEDICATED.
EVERYBODY.
IT IS ONE THING TO COME
HERE AND ITS FOUR DEGREES.
IT IS 64.
HES HAVING FUN.
I THINK HE IS.
HE IS HAVING A LOT OF FUN.
HE CERTAINLY IS.
THE PACKERS START THIS DRIVE
FROM THE 35 YARD LINE.
IN MOTION.
PASS TO THE OUTSIDE.
REACHING OUT AND BRINGING IT
IN.
IT IS LATTIMORE AGAIN.
FIRST DOWN.
YOU GO BACK TO THE FIRST
PLAY OF THE GAME AND IT WAS
MOTION FROM THE LEFT TO THE
RIGHT AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE
LATTIMORE MOVE.
GOOD WAY TO START THE DRIVE.
IN RHYTHM AGAIN.
FEET UNDERNEATH HIM.
STABLE BASE.
SIX YEARS IN THE LEAGUE
AND ONLY THIRD AS A STARTER.
LOOK OUT.
THE FLAG IS THROWN.
FIRST DOWN.
THAT WAS LATTIMORE.
CLEGGS FIVE YARD PENALTY.
AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
THAT IS THE FIRST PENALTY OF
THE HALF.
KIRK: THIS IS AGAINST THE
ROOKIE.
HES BEEN OUT A PHASE AND
HAD TO TRY TO USE HIS
AWARENESS TO CREATE A CHEAT
CODE TO HELP HIM OUT BUT
HES BEEN CAUGHT.
EIGHT TIMES.
DANCING.
MOVING TO HIS LEFT.
INCOMPLETE.
COVERAGE IS STICKY.
DOBBS THE INTENDED RECEIVER.
IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND
10.
WE HAVE SEEN LATTIMORE
TRY TO WORK ACROSS.
WATCH THE COMMUNICATION.
HE KIND OF PASSES IT OFF AND
MAKE SURE THEY ARE ON THE
SAME PAGE.
THAT FORCES JORDAN LOVE TO
GO BACK TO THE MIDDLE OF THE
FIELD SO GOOD JOB OF
ADJUSTMENT BY JOE WITT AND
THIS DEFENSE.
SECOND DOWN AND 10.
JACOBS TO THE OUTSIDE.
YOU KNOW IT IS INTERESTING
TO ME IS THAT LATTIMORE WAS
IN NEW ORLEANS A COUPLE
YEARS AGO.
YOU GO FROM A SHUTDOWN
CORNER TO A GUY YOU ARE
PICKING ON ALL NIGHT.
AND THE ONE THING ABOUT
HIM IS HE SAID AN ANKLE, AN
ABDOMEN, A HANDMADE.
YOU WONDER CLOSE -- HOW
CLOSE HE IS TO BEING ONE OF
THE ELITE CORNERS PLAYING
FOR THE SAINTS YEAR IN AND
YEAR OUT.
THESE LAST THREE YEARS HAVE
TAKEN A TOLL.
A LITTLE WEAR AND TEAR.
THIRD AND SIX.
EXTRA PRESSURE.
LOVE ESCAPES FOR THE MOMENT.
AND A FLAG IS THROWN ON THAT
ONE AS WELL.
ITS GOING TO BE ANOTHER
DEFENSIVE HOLD.
THAT WILL WIND UP AS A
FIRST AND 10.
THE PENALTY IS DECLINED.
GOOD JOB BY CRAFT PRETTY
LIGHT ON HIS FEET.
THE BALL IS IN THE AIR AND
THEN HE COMES BACK TO THE
FOOTBALL AND MAKES AN
INTERCEPTION.
JACOBS.
HE HAS NOW CARRIED THE BALL
19 TIMES.
68 YARDS.
SO IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN
AND EIGHT.
MOST RECEIVING YARDS BY A
PACKERS TIGHT END IN 10
YEARS YOU GO BACK TO ROGERS.
146.
THAT WAS IN THE GAME IN
WHICH RICHARD ROGERS RAN A
61 YARD HAIL MARY AS TIME
EXPIRED.
KIRK: DID YOU CALL THAT ONE?
AL: BELIEVE IT OR NOT I
DIDNT.
TO THE LEFT SIDE.
TAKING IT AROUND.
WILLIAMS.
HE HAD SIX RECEIVING
TOUCHDOWNS.
HE HAD SIX RUSHING
TOUCHDOWNS AND THREW A PASS
FOR A TOUCHDOWN.
HES A WILDCAT
QUARTERBACK.
THEY PUT JORDAN LOVE ALL THE
WAY OUT TO THE OUTSIDE.
AND END UP USING WILLIAMS.
EVERYONE IS THINKING THEY
WILL FLIP IT TO HIM.
INSTEAD HE FOLLOWS IT AROUND
THE EDGE AND WAS ABLE TO
FIND SOME SPACE TO WORK.
THERE YOU GO.
TAKING IT NOW IS MATTHEW
GOLDEN.
HE GOES TO THE 10 YARD LINE.
KIND OF HOLDING ONTO A
FEW THINGS.
JUST IN CASE THIS GAME GOT
INTERESTING, WHICH IT HAS.
WE HAVE SEEN A FEW WRINKLES
HERE THAT HAVE GIVEN HIM
SOME POSITIVE YARDS AND NOW
CLOSE TO THE 10 YARD LINE
10 TO PLAY.
JACOBS.
FIRST AND GOAL.
20TH CARRY OF THE NIGHT.
71 YARDS.
YOU TALK ABOUT TRYING TO
FIND WAYS TO FINISH GAMES AT
DEFENSE OR OFFENSE.
THE COMMANDERS GET WITHIN A
POSSESSION.
WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER?
WHAT KIND OF DRIVE WILL YOU
BE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER?
THE PACKERS ARE SHOWING WHAT
THEY ARE ALL ABOUT.
FROM THE EIGHT.
WIDE OPEN.
TOUCHDOWN.
TUCKER KRAFT.
AND ITS A TWO POSSESSION
GAME AGAIN.
HE HAS HAD A BIG NIGHT.
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT ALL
EVENING.
MATT LAFLEUR WITH A GOOD
DRIVE AS A PLAY CALLER.
GREAT EXECUTION.
GREAT TEAMS, CHAMPIONSHIP
TEAMS ANSWER WHEN THEY GET
CHALLENGED  MCMANUS WITH
THE EXTRA POINT.
THIRD OF THE NIGHT FOR HIM.
8:57 TO GO IN THE FOURTH.
AS THEY TAKE ON NEW ENGLAND
IN MIAMI.
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT HOW THEY HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO PLAY ZONE AND GET
ENOUGH OF A RUSH TO KEEP
THEIR EYES ON ON HIM AND
PREVENT THEM FROM MAKING
PLAYS.
YOU HAVE EYES ON THE
QUARTERBACK THEIR EYES
FOCUSED ON JAYDEN DANIELS.
AL: FROM THE 35 YARD LINE.
DECENT PRESSURE WITH DECENT
COVERAGE.
HE TAKES OFF HER A PICK UP
OF ABOUT THREE.
SECOND DOWN.
RIGHT ON CUE.
WE JUST SAW IT AGAIN.
THE DEFENSE ABLE TO TAKE
AWAY ALL HIS OPTIONS
DOWNFIELD.
JUST NOTHING THERE.
AND EVENTUALLY THEY ARE ABLE
TO GET TO HIM.
SECOND DOWN AND NINE.
TOUGH THREE YARDS.
EVERY THIRD DOWN NOW A BIG
ONE WITH EIGHT TO PLAY.
KIRK: LOOKING AT NOT JUST
TONIGHT BUT THE REST OF THE
SEASON YOU LOOK AT THE
WEAPONS HE HAS.
WHAT REALLY CAN STRIKE FEAR
IN A DEFENSE.
MCLAURIN COULD BE THAT GUY
COULD DEEBO SAMUEL STILL BE
THAT GUY?
I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND
ANYBODY TONIGHT.
AL: THATS BATTED.
THAT IS JAVON SAY WHY IT --
THAT IS WYATT.
FOURTH AND FOUR.
KIRK: YOU GET SO USED TO
SEEING THE FOUR THAT TIME
THEY ARE ABLE TO SLIP A
LINEBACKER OVER AND NOBODY
PICKS HIM UP.
PLAY OF THE GAME.
AL: WASHINGTON PUSHING ITS
CHIPS IN NOW.
TRYING TO KEEP THE DRIVE
ALIVE.
SAMUEL IN MOTION.
AGAIN, PRESSURE.
INCOMPLETE.
BATTED DOWN.
THEY WENT FOR KEYSHAWN
NIXON.
HAVING A NICE NIGHT BETTING
IT AWAY.
TURN IT OVER.
KIRK: THAT TIME THEY BROUGHT
THE BLITZ.
FOURTH AND SHORT, YOU KNOW
THEY WILL BE GOING TO
SOMETHING QUICK.
GOOD JOB BY NIXON.
GETS AROUND THE RECEIVER,
GETS THE LEFT-HAND OUT AND
KNOCKED THE BALL AWAY.
PACKERS DEFENSE DOE THE OLD FOX RIVER.
AL: THE OLD FOX RIVER.
YES, SIR.
THE SALMON.
BACK TO PASS.
GOING DEEP WITH A KILL SHOT
BUT INCOMPLETE.
SECOND DOWN AND 10.
KIRK: THIS IS A TEAM AND A
FRANCHISE THAT FEELS THAT
THEY CAN DO SOME SPECIAL
THINGS THIS YEAR.
AL: HE WAS A GREAT EXECUTIVE
IN SAN FRANCISCO.
TERRIFIC JOB IN GREEN BAY.
KIRK: YOU HAVE A HEAD COACH
YOU CAN WITH THE BEST OF
THEM.
YOU HAVE A LOT OF PLAYERS
AROUND HIM.
YOU HAVE A DEFENSE THAT
COULD BE THE BEST IN THE
NFL.
AL: RIGHT NOW THEY ARE ON
THE CUSP OF GOING 2-0.
FOUR OF THEIR NEXT FIVE
GAMES ARE ON THE ROAD.
AT CLEVELAND, AT DALLAS,
CINCINNATI COMES HERE, THEN
AT ARIZONA AND PITTSBURGH.
KIRK: IT IS OBVIOUS IT IS
EARLY.
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS TEAM AND
YOU LOOK AT THE SWAGGER AND
THE CONFIDENCE THEY ARE
PLAYING WITH, HOW GREAT WILL
THAT BE?
WHEN THIS TEAM GOES BACK TO
DALLAS.
IT FEELS LIKE THIS IS A TEAM
THAT HAS PLACES -- PIECES IN
THE RIGHT PLACES.
NOW YOU ADD MICAH PARSONS TO
THAT.
THEY WILL BE TOUGH TO DEAL
WITH.
WHAT A GREAT DIVISION.
YOU LOOK AT WHAT J.J.
MCCARTHY IS DOING WITH
MINNESOTA.
HERE IS FOURTH DOWN.
THEY WILL LINE UP FOR A 56
YARD FIELD GOAL.
THE CLOCK IS RUNNING ALL THE
WAY DOWN.
WHAT ELSE IS NEW?
HALF OF THE LEAGUE.
MIKE SHANAHAN WAS VERY
INSTRUMENTAL.
DAN QUINN.
56 YARD ATTEMPT FOR MCMANUS.
TRY TO MAKE THE LEAD 17
POINTS.
WE GET TO DO THAT NEXT
THURSDAY.
AT HALFTIME THEY HONORED
STERLING SHARPE.
MATT LAFLEUR WAS
CONGRATULATING HIM.
HE MADE THE MOST OF THOSE
YEARS.
WHAT A GREAT PLAYER.
THE COMMANDERS WILL START
FROM THE 35 YARD LINE.
SECOND AND SHORT.
FOR THE COMMANDERS, THERE
WAS ANYTHING BUT A
COMMANDING VICTORY BUT THEY
BEAT THE GIANTS.
THIS TIME IT IS TERRY
MCLAURIN.
KIRK: NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
JAYDEN DANIELS TOLD US THERE
WAS NOT A LOT OF TIME TO GET
SOME WORK IN.
THEY HAD TO WORK A LOT AFTER
PRACTICE TO TRY TO SHARPEN
UP THEIR TIMING.
AL: THAT IS FIRED AND BROKEN
UP.
NIXON, THE SEVENTH YEAR MAN
OF SOUTH CAROLINA, BREAKS IT
OUT.
KIRK: AS THIS DEFENSE GROWS,
HOBBES CAN PLAY TO THE
INSIDE.
YOU THROW IN AT SAFETY.
THEY HAVE SIX GUYS THAT THEY
REALLY FEEL GOOD ABOUT.
IT IS GREAT TO SEE HOBBS
BACK TO HELP THIS DEFENSE.
AL: ALL NIGHT LONG IN HIS
FACE.
HE HAS HAD A NICE NIGHT.
THIRD AND 10.
OVER THE MIDDLE.
SAMUEL IS ABLE TO GET A
FIRST DOWN TO THE 32.
KIRK: THEY USED HIM ON MICAH
PARSONS AT THE LINE OF
SCRIMMAGE IS THAT HE WAS
ABLE TO SHIP.
IT LOOKS LIKE AUSTIN EKELER
WAS DOWN.
I WAS AWAY FROM THE BALL.
AL: IN THAT SPOT.
KIRK: THERE WAS NOT ANY
CONTACT.
HE IS TRYING TO CUT.
WHEN HE MAKES IT CUT, THE
JUST DID SOMETHING.
AL: IT IS ALMOST WORSE THAN
A CONTACT INJURY IN SOME
CASES.
SOME REALLY GOOD YEARS WITH
THE CHARGERS.
A GOOD GUY.
OUT OF WESTERN STATE, A
SMALL SCHOOL.
HIS MOTHER PUT HIM ON
BUCKING BRONCOS A KID.
THAT IS WHY HE HAS SUCH
FANTASTIC BALANCE.
A TOUGH LOSS.
JEREMY MCNICHOLS WOULD BE
THE NEXT GUY.
KIRK: WE ALREADY SAW SOME
OTHER PEOPLE GO DOWN WITH A
TOUGH INJURY.
YOU CAN SEE FROM HIS FACIAL
EXPRESSIONS.
SUPER CONCERNED WITH WHAT
THAT MIGHT BE.
AL: HE IS OPEN INSIDE THE 20
YARD LINE.
DOWN BY THREE POSSESSIONS.
KIRK: GOOD JOB BY MCCAFFREY.
ABLE TO RECOGNIZE IT AND
MAKE THE THROW.
AL: HE HAS PRETTY GOOD
BLOODLINES.
WITH HIS BROTHER AND HIS
FATHER.
KIRK: HIS MOM IS PROBABLY
THE BEST ATHLETE IN THE
FAMILY.
AL: RIGHT.
HIS GRANDFATHER WAS AN
OLYMPIC SPRINTER.
KIRK: YOU CAN SEE JAYDEN
DANIELS WAVED HIM OFF.
HE GOES DOWN AND LANDS
AWKWARDLY.
HE DID NOT WANT TO COME OUT
OF THIS GAME.
AL: SECOND AND 9.
THIRD DOWN.
KIRK: THAT IS EVERYONES
FEAR.
ANYTIME A QUARTERBACK TAKES
OFF TO SCRAMBLE.
BEING BROUGHT DOWN FROM
BEHIND.
NICE THROW ON THE NEXT PLAY.
AL: HE WAS RUSHED SEVEN
TIMES.
TO THE END ZONE.
TOO HIGH.
A FLAG IS THROWN.
THERE IT IS ON THE FOUR YARD
LINE.
YOU CAN TELL BY HIS
EXPRESSION.
REFEREE: HOLDING COME OF,
NUMBER 29, HALF THE DISTANCE
TO THE GOAL.
AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
KIRK: THAT IS ON MCKINNEY.
HE IS GIVING UP SOME SIZE.
BUT HE HAS TREMENDOUS
ATHLETIC ABILITY.
HE IS JUST TRYING TO HOLD
ON.
A BIG GUY.
TRY TO USE HIS HEAD.
HE KIND OF FELL ONTO HIS
SHOULDER PADS.
AL: GREEN BAY MAKING SOME
SUBSTITUTIONS.
THAT IS WHY PLAY IS HELD UP.
THE PLAY CLOCK GOES DOWN TO
FIVE.
LETS BRING IN TERRY
MCCAULEY AND HAVE A
THREE-WAY HERE ON CAMERA.
HOW LONG CAN THE UMPIRE HOLD
OF THE PLAY IN THAT
SITUATION?
ONCE THE OFFENSE DECLARES
ITS PACKAGE, THE DEFENSE HAS
TO HAVE A REASONABLE AMOUNT
OF TIME TO MATCHUP.
THEY GET A FAIR AMOUNT OF
TIME.
THEY DID GET TO MATCHUP.
KIRK: WHAT IS THE REASON?
IT IS REALLY A FEEL THING
.
THEY HAVE TO GET IN THERE.
AL: FIRST AND GOAL.
EKELER IS BEING CARTED BACK
TO THE LOCKER ROOM.
WE JUST WANTED TO GET YOU IN
TO MAKE SURE YOU HAD
SOMETHING TO SAY.
KIRK: WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF
THESE DEFENSIVE LINEMAN.
YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM A LOT
OF CREDIT.
THEY PLAYED MOST OF THE
SNAPS IN THE INTERIOR.
HE CAUSED THAT PENALTY.
AL: DANIELS SURROUNDED.
BROOKS, THE FIRST TIME WE
HAVE MENTIONED HIS NAME
TONIGHT.
KIRK: ONCE AGAIN THE
COMBINATION OF COVERAGE WITH
SEVEN DEFENDERS.
IN A TIGHT SPACE.
AND RUSHING FOUR.
YOU TAKE AWAY THE RECEIVERS
AND EVENTUALLY THE PASS RUSH
IS ABLE TO GET THERE AND
SQUEEZE JAYDEN DANIELS.
AL: THREE MINUTES LEFT.
SECOND AND GOAL.
HERE THEY COME.
THE PASS IS CAUGHT.
DEEBO SAMUELS INTO THE END
ZONE.
THAT WILL MAKE IT A TWO
POSSESSION GAME.
KIRK: GOOD JOB OF GETTING
DEEBO SAMUEL THE FOOTBALL.
HE IS A GUY WHO HAS
TREMENDOUS TOUGHNESS.
WE THOUGHT HE MIGHT COME
OUT.
HE GOT DRILLED WHEN HE
THROUGH THIS FOOTBALL.
WE WILL SHOW YOU IN A
SECOND.
NICE JOB OF GETTING THAT
TOUCHDOWN.
AL: TWO POINTS TRY TO MAKE
IT A NINE POINT GAME.
YOU ARE ALREADY THINKING
AHEAD TO AN ONSIDE, WHICH
THESE DAYS HAS TO BE
DECLARED.
FLAG THROWN.
THE PASS WENT INTO THE END
ZONE.
MCCAFFREY MADE THE GRAB.
THE PENALTY WILL BE AGAINST
THE PACKERS.
THAT WILL COUNT.
REFEREE: OFFSIDES, DEFENSE,
NUMBER 90.
THAT PENALTY WILL BE
ENFORCED ON THE KICKOFF.
THE RESULT OF THE PLAY IS A
SUCCESSFUL TRY.
KIRK: WE TALK SO MUCH ABOUT
ZONE COVERAGE OF THE
PACKERS.
THERE IS MAN-TO-MAN, DEEBO
SAMUEL AGAINST EVAN
WILLIAMS.
THEY ARE RUSHING SIX.
THAT BALL HAS TO GET OUT IN
A HURRY.
THIS GIVES DEEBO SAMUEL A
CHANCE.
YOU KNOW WHAT HE CAN DO.
AS SOON AS HE THROWS THE
FOOTBALL COMMITTEE LEVERS --
LEVELS JAYDEN DANIELS.
THERE IS THE TWO-POINT
CONVERSION.
AL: DANIELS HOPING THEY CAN
RECOVER AN ONSIDE KICK,
WHICH HAS TO BE DECLARED.
5.4% LAST YEAR.
THE NEW RULES MAKE IT SO
HARD.
STRANGER THINGS HAVE
HAPPENED, MY FRIEND.
IT IS A WEIRD NIGHT.
WE COVER THE EARTH LIKE
SHERMAN WILLIAMS.
IT HAS TO GO 10 YARDS.
UNLESS IT IS TOUCHED BY THE
RECEIVING TEAM.
GAY COMES FORWARD.
THE BOUNCING BALL IS
HANDLED.
WICKS.
THEY PUT ALL THE GOOD HANDS
PEOPLE UP THERE IN THAT
SITUATION.
HE SECURES IT.
KIRK: THERE ARE A LOT OF
STORYLINES TO THIS ONE.
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU
WANT.
THE BIG JUMP.
THAT GIVES YOUR COVER TEAM A
CHANCE TO COME UP WITH IT.
WICKS TIMES THAT UP
PERFECTLY.
HE GOT DOWN IN A HURRY TO
SECURE THAT BALL.
AL: 2:52.
WASHINGTON HAS ONE TIMEOUT.
AND THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
THROUGH THE MIDDLE.
TO THE 50 YARD LINE.
KAYLEE: AS YOU WOULD EXPECT,
AUSTIN EKELER WAS CARTED OFF
THE FIELD.
HE HAD A NONCONTACT INJURY.
THE COMMANDER SAID HE IS
RULED OUT WITH AN ACHILLES
INJURY.
AL: THAT DID NOT LOOK GOOD.
KIRK: ANYTIME YOU SEE A PLAY
OR GO DOWN WHEN THERE IS NOT
ANY CONTACT, WHEN HE MAKES A
CUT LIKE THAT TO CHANGE
DIRECTION AND HE REACHES
DOWN, ALL OF US HOLD OUR
BREATH HOPING IT IS NOT THE
ACHILLES.
AL: CERTAINLY NOT A TEAR.
KIRK: WHAT A NIGHT FOR THIS
DEFENSE.
JAYDEN DANIELS LED ALL NFL
QUARTERBACKS LAST YEAR WITH
33 FIRST DOWNS ON SCRAMBLES.
TONIGHT SEVEN SCRAMBLES, 17
YARDS.
THAT IS IT.
THEY DID THEIR JOB
CONTAINING HIM.
AL: SECOND DOWN AND 8.
LOVE WILL GO DOWN.
THAT WILL AT LEAST KEEP THE
CLOCK RUNNING.
THEY WILL HAVE TO GET A
PLAYOFF BEFORE THE
TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
KIRK: IT IS WEEK TWOO.
YOURE GOING TO LOSE THIS
FOOTBALL GAME IF YOURE THE
COMMANDERS BUT THE GREATEST
THING YOU CAN SAY, AND I
THINK YOU SAID THIS, YOU
WANT TO SEE GUYS COMPETE,
PLAY HARD, TACKLE, RUN TO
THE FOOTBALL.
I THINK YOU WILL SEE SOME
THINGS THAT A DISAPPOINTING
BUT HE WILL SEE A
QUARTERBACK WHO HE LOOKS TO
AS THE LEADER, THE ALPHA OF
THE TEAM.
HE STAYS ON THE FIELD.
HE KEEPS FINISHING DRIVES.
THERE IS SOME STUFF HE WILL
BE HAPPY ABOUT THAT HE CAN
BUILD ON EARLY IN THE YEAR.
AL: JACOBS.
OUR PRODUCER SAYS LETS GO
DOWN MEMORY LANE.
âª GEORGE BUSH THROWING A
SLIDER.
KIRK: HE PAINTED IT.
AL: IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
KIRK: PERFECT.
AL: THE 24TH COMMEMORATION
OF THAT TERRIBLE DAY.
FOURTH DOWN.
THE PACKERS WILL SEND IT
SKYWARD.
AND INTO THE END ZONE.
THE PACKERS ON THE VERGE OF
GOING TO 2-0 AGAINST A
COUPLE OF QUALITY
COMPONENTS.
-- OPPONENTS.
THEY WILL GO ON THE ROAD FOR
FOUR OF THE NEXT FIVE.
DANIELS TO SAMUEL.
NICE MOVES.
KIRK: HES A MOTIVATED
PLAYER.
MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT HE MIGHT
SLOW DOWN IN SAN FRANCISCO.
HE STILL HAS PLENTY LEFT.
HE IS SHOWING THAT HERE.
AL: ZACH ERTZ HAS HAD A VERY
NICE NIGHT.
SIX CATCHES.
KIRK: THEY ARE PLAYING WITH
SUCH A URGENCY RIGHT NOW.
FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.
I THOUGHT WE MIGHT SEE A
LITTLE MORE OF THIS KIND OF
NASCAR TEMPO TO SLOW DOWN
THIS AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE.
WE GOT TO BE AT A POINT
WHERE THE GAME WAS OUT OF
REACH.
AL: THEY PLAYED A LOT THAT
LAST YEAR.
KIRK: IT IS SOMETHING THEY
ARE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH.
JAYDEN DANIELS COMING OUT OF
COLLEGE AT LSU.
AL: 58 SECONDS LEFT.
INCOMPLETE.
KIRK: HE IS DOING EVERYTHING
HE CAN TO COME UP WITH A
INTERCEPTION.
HE WAS TRYING TO GET
UNDERNEATH IT.
ALMOST PLAYING LIKE A
LINEBACKER.
NOT REALLY PASS RUSHING.
SHOWING HIS ATHLETIC
ABILITY.
HE CAME CLOSE.
VERY UNDERRATED INTERIOR
PLAYER FOR THIS DEFENSE.
AL: HE HAS HAD A REAL NICE
NIGHT.
THIRD DOWN AND 10.
THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE.
EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT
MICAH PARSONS.
A LOT OF THE GUYS UP FRONT
YOU DO NOT HEAR ABOUT.
HE SAID I AM MOTIVATED NOW.
WE CANNOT STOP THE RUN?
YES, WE CAN.
KIRK: HE WAS REALLY THE FACE
OF THAT DEFENSE.
IT OPENS UP OPPORTUNITIES
WITH HIM BEING IN DALLAS
NOW.
THEY ARE ALL TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF IT.
AL: FOURTH DOWN, LAST GASP
HERE.
THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE.
NOTHING HAPPENING UPFIELD.
WHO PUT THE PRESSURE ON?
NUMBERERO UNO.
KIRK: YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE
ONE MORE LOOK AT NUMBER ONE.
THE THING TO REMEMBER
TONIGHT IS NOT HIS IMPACT,
IT IS HOW HE IMPACTS THE
GAME.
WHAT A GREAT MOVE.
I DONT KNOW IF HE WILL PLAY
AGAINST BETTER TACKLES ALL
YEAR.
AND HE STILL MAKES HIS
PRESENCE FELT WHERE DANIELS
HAS TO GET RID OF THE
FOOTBALL OR HE IS GOING TO
GET SACKED.
AL: UNBELIEVABLE.
NO TRAINING CAMP, HAD A BACK
ISSUE, THEY ARE CHATTING
WITH EACH OTHER.
BOTH SMILING.
[LAUGHTER]
MICAH PARSONS IS SAYING YOU
ARE STILL ON THE ROOKIE
CONTRACT.
BUT YOURS IS COMING.
YOU WILL BE HERE SOON.
KIRK: THE POSTGAME SHOW,
MAYBE THEY CAN BREAK THIS
DOWN.
JORDAN LOVE, HE HAD NO
PRESSURE.
HE HAD FOUR INCOMPLETIONS
ALL SEASON WHEN TEAMS DO NOT
AFFECT HIM.
YOU BETTER AFFECT NUMBER 10
OR THEY ARE GOING TO PUT UP
A LOT OF POINTS ON YOU.
AL: NO QUESTION.
THE PACKERS GO TO 2-0.
THE COMMANDERS GO TO 1-1.
EACH TEAM WITH A MINI-BYE
RIGHT NOW.
THE QUARTERBACKS RIGHT
THERE.
BOTH TEAMS WILL BE IT IN
ACTION IN 10 DAYS.
FIREWORKS GOING OFF AT
LAMBEAU FIELD.
