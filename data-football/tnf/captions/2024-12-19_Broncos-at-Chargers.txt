[ct=6.379] INDIANAPOLIS COLTS AND
[ct=6.665] THE TEAMS WITH SIX
[ct=8.884] NS.
[ct=11.469] DENVER WON THE TOSS.
[ct=11.469] THEY DEFER.
[ct=14.062] THE KICKOFF WILL BE
[ct=15.457] INTO THE END ZONE AND
[ct=15.999] BACK WE’LL COME TO THE
[ct=17.563] 30 YARD LINE TO BEGIN
[ct=18.015] THINGS ON THIS
[ct=19.822] THURSDAY NIGHT.
[ct=21.093] OPENING GAME OF THE
[ct=22.813] 16th WEEK.
[ct=26.918] JUSTIN HERBERT, 16
[ct=28.218] TOUCHDOWNS, ONLY TWO
[ct=29.560] INTERCEPTIONS.
[ct=30.316] ONE OF THEM CAME IN
[ct=31.275] WEEK 2 AGAINST
[ct=32.463] CAROLINA.
[ct=33.431] THE OTHER CAME IN THE
[ct=35.879] GAME LAST WEEK AGAINST
[ct=36.104] THE TAMPA BAY
[ct=37.756] BUCCANEERS.
[ct=38.244] SO THE CHARGERS COMING
[ct=39.062] OFF WITHOUT QUESTION
[ct=39.529] THEIR WORST GAME OF
[ct=40.835] THE SEASON.
[ct=44.854] HOW WILL THEY REBOUND?
[ct=45.141] WAS LAST WEEK AN
[ct=46.347] ABERRATION OR A
[ct=47.501] HARBINGER?
[ct=47.885] WE’LL FIND OUT
[ct=48.837] TONIGHT.
[ct=49.960] FROM THE 30 YARD LINE
[ct=50.448] TO BEGIN.
[ct=51.514] ON THE GROUND.
[ct=54.213] WITH A GAIN OF ABOUT 4
[ct=56.670] YARDS, GUS EDWARDS,
[ct=56.897] THE FORMER BALTIMORE
[ct=57.763] RAVEN TAKES IT OUT
[ct=59.338] THERE.
[ct=60.833] HE’S MINUS HIS MATE,
[ct=61.858] J.K. DOBBINS WHO WILL
[ct=62.693] BE THEIR NUMBER ONE
[ct=63.359] BACK.
[ct=64.497] HE’S BEEN OUT FOR THE
[ct=65.845] LAST FOUR WEEKS.
[ct=67.104] THEY HOPE TO HAVE HIM
[ct=70.663] BACK NEXT WEEK AT NEW
[ct=70.929] ZEALAND.
[ct=72.793] DIFFERENT OFFENSE
[ct=73.261] WITHOUT HIM IN THERE.
[ct=74.002] WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT
[ct=74.877] THEY’VE DONE.
[ct=75.716] THEY MIXED THE JUICE,
[ct=77.459] THE QUICKNESS THAT HE
[ct=78.220] PROVIDED TO THAT
[ct=78.868] RUNNING GAME.
[ct=79.896] MUCH MORE PHYSICAL
[ct=80.843] DOWNHILL WITH EDWARDS
[ct=81.903] IN THERE.
[ct=83.128] >> Al: YEAH, DOBBINS
[ct=85.300] AVERAGING 4.8.
[ct=86.412] AND EDWARDS AVERAGING
[ct=87.381] 3.4.
[ct=88.028] TAKES THE SWING PASS
[ct=89.361] AND IS OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=90.459] IT’LL BE 3rd DOWN AND
[ct=92.437] RUN OUT THERE BY
[ct=94.529] BRANDON JONES.
[ct=95.269] >> Kirk: YEAH, YOU’LL
[ct=96.325] SEE THIS OFFENSE
[ct=98.150] GREG ROMAN IS THE
[ct=99.297] OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR.
[ct=100.578] HE AND JIM HARBAUGH
[ct=101.362] HAVE A LOT OF HISTORY
[ct=101.963] OVER THE YEARS
[ct=102.492] TOGETHER IN COLLEGE
[ct=103.274] AND IN PRO.
[ct=103.853] THERE HE IS.
[ct=104.969] OF COURSE WAS IN
[ct=105.757] BALTIMORE WITH HIS
[ct=106.573] BROTHER, JOHN, FOR A
[ct=107.697] NUMBER OF YEARS.
[ct=108.603] SO FAMILIAR WITH THE
[ct=109.896] CULTURE AND WHAT THEY
[ct=110.862] WANT TO DO, BUT
[ct=112.137] TONIGHT, YOU KNOW, A
[ct=112.983] BIT SHORT-HANDED
[ct=113.507] WITHOUT DOBBINS.
[ct=114.177] THE BATTLE IN THE
[ct=115.280] TRENCHES, ESPECIALLY
[ct=117.701] IN THE INTERIOR IS
[ct=119.527] KEY.
[ct=120.010] >> Al: THREE TIGHT
[ct=120.588] ENDS WILL COME THE
[ct=121.581] OTHER WAY AND GET
[ct=122.888] STOPPED AT THE 35, BUT
[ct=127.697] THERE IS A FLAG.
[ct=129.088] CODY BARTON MADE THE
[ct=130.326] TACKLE.
[ct=132.043] WE SAW HIM AGAINST NEW
[ct=132.429] ORLEANS THURSDAY NIGHT
[ct=133.142] EARLIER THIS YEAR.
[ct=136.338] HE WAS TREMENDOUS.
[ct=136.870] PENALTY WILL BE
[ct=138.907] DECLINED.
[ct=140.183] PENALTY IS ON RASHAWN
[ct=141.547] SLATER.
[ct=142.867] SO IT’S A VERY FAST
[ct=144.766] THREE AND OUT FOR THE
[ct=145.159] CHARGERS.
[ct=146.446] >> Kirk: THE HOLDING
[ct=147.069] CALL ON THE LEFT
[ct=148.762] TACKLE, SLATER YOU
[ct=149.889] MENTIONED, HE’S GOING
[ct=152.537] TO PULL AROUND, AND
[ct=154.873] ONCE HE GETS HERE, HE
[ct=155.064] GETS LOCKED UP.
[ct=155.510] LOOK AT THE JERSEYS
[ct=156.152] FLYING TO THE
[ct=156.707] FOOTBALL.
[ct=157.222] KNOWING THIS OFFENSE
[ct=157.962] IS TRYING TO FIND PLAY
[ct=159.235] MAKERS, AND A BIT,
[ct=160.597] AGAIN, A LITTLE BIT
[ct=161.245] PREDICTABLE WITH THAT
[ct=163.669] PLAY CALLING HERE,
[ct=165.876] JUST KIND OF FEELING
[ct=167.205] THINGS OUT.
[ct=172.469] >> Al: J.K. SENDING IT
[ct=173.831] DOWN.
[ct=173.969] AND MAKES A FAIR CATCH
[ct=176.709] AT THE 20 YARD LINE.
[ct=179.179] SO BO NIX, FIRST-ROUND
[ct=179.916] PICK, SIXTH
[ct=181.827] QUARTERBACK PICK.
[ct=183.209] BEEN A GEM SO FAR.
[ct=184.589] 20 TOUCHDOWNS, 11
[ct=186.107] COMING OFF A GAME IN
[ct=186.986] WHICH HE HAD THREE
[ct=187.983] TOUCHDOWNS AND THREE
[ct=190.877] INTERCEPTIONS, BUT
[ct=190.877] THEY FOUND A WAY TO
[ct=193.541] WIN LAST WEEK AGAINST
[ct=193.995] INDIANAPOLIS.
[ct=194.591] >> Kirk: YOU KNOW, I
[ct=196.499] THINK AS A ROOKIE A
[ct=196.937] LOT OF PEOPLE LOOKED
[ct=198.380] AT THAT AS THE WAY HE
[ct=199.207] RESPONDED TO
[ct=202.046] YEAH, HE MADE SOME BAD
[ct=202.240] DECISIONS, THREW THE
[ct=203.041] BALL INTO COVERAGE.
[ct=205.054] BUT IT’S HOW YOU
[ct=205.297] RESPOND.
[ct=205.685] THAT’S WHAT HIS
[ct=206.372] COACHES AND HIS
[ct=207.253] TEAMMATES WERE REALLY
[ct=212.791] HAPPY TO SEE.
[ct=213.424] >> Al: McLAUGHLIN IS
[ct=213.820] OUT TONIGHT, ONE OF
[ct=218.109] THEIR RUNNING BACKS.
[ct=219.410] START ON THE OUTSIDE,
[ct=223.744] NICE GAIN BY JAVONTE
[ct=225.156] WILLIAMS.
[ct=226.364] TAKEN DOWN BY HENLEY
[ct=228.243] WHO LEADS IN TACKLES.
[ct=229.461] >> Kirk: IF DENVER’S
[ct=230.797] SERIOUS ABOUT THAT,
[ct=232.088] THEY’RE GOING TO GET
[ct=233.356] BETTER.
[ct=235.911] AND SEAN PAYTON WILL
[ct=237.214] BE THE ONE TO TELL YOU
[ct=238.669] IT’S BEEN BIG IN
[ct=239.712] DENVER, THE LACK OF
[ct=241.376] THAT RUNNING GAME.
[ct=243.921] AND I THINK ESTIME IS
[ct=246.141] GOING TO GET AN
[ct=246.550] OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW
[ct=247.820] WHAT HE CAN DO, THE
[ct=249.439] ROOKIE OUT OF NOTRE
[ct=249.734] DAME.
[ct=250.422] >> Al: AGAIN ON THE
[ct=251.056] GROUND.
[ct=251.789] AND TRYING TO WORK HIS
[ct=253.555] WAY FOR A FIRST DOWN
[ct=254.677] IS JAVOPT A.I.
[ct=256.329] WILLIAMS, AND HE HE
[ct=257.245] HAS IT.
[ct=258.129] UTE AT THE 40 YARD
[ct=259.144] LINE.
[ct=259.475] >> Kirk: NICE HOLD
[ct=261.700] OPENS UP.
[ct=266.100] JAVONTE WILLIAMS THERE
[ct=266.658] WAS A LOT OF BIG
[ct=268.348] EXPECTATIONS WHAT HE
[ct=268.528] COULD DO.
[ct=269.275] OF COURSE HAD SOME
[ct=269.872] INJURIES.
[ct=270.569] WAITING FOR HIM TO
[ct=271.880] COME BACK AND BE THAT
[ct=274.413] TYPE OF BACK RIGHT
[ct=274.914] THERE WHERE HE FIGHTS
[ct=275.306] FOR THAT SECOND AND
[ct=276.264] THIRD EFFORT TO GET IT
[ct=279.461] HE DID IT THERE.
[ct=279.461] >> Al: MARVIN MIMS
[ct=281.767] LINES UP IN THE BACK
[ct=282.217] FIELD NOW.
[ct=284.999] THE WIDE RECEIVER.
[ct=285.874] THEY TOSS IT TO HIM,
[ct=287.097] LOT OF SPEED, GETS
[ct=289.459] AROUND A CORNER, BUT
[ct=290.163] THEN FORCED OUT OF
[ct=291.823] BOUNDS.
[ct=292.184] BOSA IS RIGHT THERE TO
[ct=294.151] FORCE HIM OUT AFTER A
[ct=295.480] SHORT GAIN OF 2.
[ct=298.415] 2nd DOWN AND 8.
[ct=301.060] HAS COME OUT AND SAID
[ct=302.028] RECENTLY ABOUT WE’VE
[ct=305.239] GOT TO FIND WAYS TO
[ct=305.409] GET 19 THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=306.299] WE SEE WHAT HE CAN DO
[ct=307.365] AS A RETURNER, AND
[ct=308.388] RIGHT AWAY LINING
[ct=310.758] UP IN THE BACK FIELD,
[ct=311.425] ANOTHER WAY TO TRY TO
[ct=311.957] GET HIS HANDS ON A
[ct=314.259] BALL AND TRY TO GET
[ct=316.181] HIM IN THE CORNER AND
[ct=317.488] PICK UP SOME POSITIVES
[ct=320.199] YARDS THERE ON A 1st
[ct=321.406] AND 10 PLAY.
[ct=321.790] >> Al: TRYING TO GET
[ct=328.743] HIM ON A DEBOE SAMUEL
[ct=330.322] ROLL.
[ct=330.794] FOUR-MAN RUSH, GREAT
[ct=331.100] PROTECTION.
[ct=331.607] FIRED OVER THE MIDDLE
[ct=331.969] AND A COUPLE OF YARDS
[ct=332.944] SHY OF THE FIRST DOWN
[ct=334.190] IS MICHAEL BURTON,
[ct=335.058] FULL BACK.
[ct=337.281] SO 3rd DOWN AND 2 FOR
[ct=338.583] DENVER.
[ct=338.583] >> Kirk: A NICE
[ct=338.990] DECISION, A SIMPLE
[ct=339.900] DECISION, YOU WOULD
[ct=340.828] THINK, BY THE ROOKIE
[ct=341.605] QUARTERBACK.
[ct=342.420] BUT HE’S A DIFFERENT
[ct=343.764] GUY THAN THIS CHARGERS
[ct=344.653] TEAM MET IN WEEK 6,
[ct=345.480] WHERE REALLY THIS
[ct=346.603] DENVER OFFENSE
[ct=347.909] STRUGGLED MIGHTILY IN
[ct=349.198] THAT -- IN THAT FIRST
[ct=350.119] MATCHUP.
[ct=351.094] AND HE’S A DIFFERENT
[ct=352.818] GUY THROUGH THIS
[ct=353.641] EXPERIENCE, THE UPS,
[ct=355.450] THE DOWNS, AND THAT
[ct=358.342] WAS AN EXAMPLE.
[ct=358.933] PUTS THEM IN A BETTER
[ct=359.182] POSITION HERE ON THAT
[ct=359.693] THIRD DOWN BY JUST
[ct=361.056] HITTING THAT CHECK
[ct=362.290] >> Al: WILLIAMS BACK
[ct=366.442] IN AS THE RUNNING
[ct=368.275] MIMS IN MOTION,
[ct=369.261] CIRCLING.
[ct=371.842] GIVE IT TO WILLIAMS.
[ct=372.690] WILLIAMS FOR A FIRST
[ct=373.808] AND ALL THE WAY DOWN
[ct=375.654] TO THE CHARGER 38 YARD
[ct=377.230] TACKLE THERE BY TONY
[ct=378.013] JEFFERSON.
[ct=378.935] GAIN OF 14.
[ct=380.202] >> Kirk: IT’S A REALLY
[ct=380.966] NICE JOB BY THE RIGHT
[ct=382.465] SIDE OF THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=385.772] WATCH THE RIGHT GUARD,
[ct=386.780] 77 HELPS AND THEN
[ct=387.943] CLIMBS UP TO THE
[ct=388.773] LINEBACKER THERE.
[ct=389.931] GETS HIS HANDS ON
[ct=391.418] DENZEL PERRYMAN.
[ct=393.010] AND I THOUGHT DENVER
[ct=393.230] COULDN’T RUN THE
[ct=394.905] WHAT’S GOING ON HERE
[ct=395.888] IN THIS OPENING DRIVE?
[ct=397.145] THEY’RE MOVING PEOPLE
[ct=397.457] OFF THE LINE OF
[ct=398.613] SCRIMMAGE, AND THESE
[ct=399.945] BACKS ARE RUNNING WITH
[ct=400.414] AUTHORITY.
[ct=401.429] LOOKS GOOD HERE ON
[ct=404.843] THIS OPENING DRIVE.
[ct=404.843] >> Al: NOW, BLAKE
[ct=406.068] WATSON, THEY JUST
[ct=406.875] BROUGHT HIM UP.
[ct=408.045] HE IS THE RUNNING
[ct=409.662] PLAYED AT MEMPHIS,
[ct=410.948] FREE AGENT PICKUP.
[ct=411.502] PLAY ACTION, UNDER
[ct=412.156] PRESSURE.
[ct=412.712] HE GETS IT AWAY.
[ct=415.259] HERE AND PICKUPED UP
[ct=416.606] AT THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=417.989] THEY GO TO NATE
[ct=418.592] ADKINS, ONE OF THEIR
[ct=419.567] TIGHT ENDS.
[ct=420.079] ADKINS WITH A
[ct=421.798] TOUCHDOWN LAST WEEK.
[ct=423.387] SO DERWIN JAMES BUT
[ct=424.981] THE PRESSURE UP, BUT
[ct=426.353] NIX RIGHT THERE TO GET
[ct=429.568] RID OF IT.
[ct=429.568] >> Kirk: WATCH THE
[ct=429.754] HEAD.
[ct=430.938] RIGHT AWAY TURNS IT.
[ct=431.777] SO THAT MEANS IN CASE
[ct=434.097] HE GETS PRESSURE, HE’S
[ct=434.253] GOT AN ANSWER.
[ct=434.822] THAT’S REALLY GOOD
[ct=435.386] JOB.
[ct=436.254] OFFENSE THAT HE RAN
[ct=440.883] SIMILAR TO WHAT HE DIZ
[ct=441.131] SIMILAR TO WHAT HE DID
[ct=442.162] IN COLLEGE.
[ct=442.886] HEAD TURNED, NOT
[ct=445.333] SURPRISED BY DERWIN
[ct=446.059] JAMES THERE GETTING IN
[ct=448.828] HIS FACE IN A HURRY.
[ct=450.647] >> Al: THE NEW RUNNING
[ct=453.145] BACK IS AUDRIC ESTIME.
[ct=455.516] GIVE IT TO HIM, LITTLE
[ct=458.840] HESITATION.
[ct=459.047] YOU’VE GOT WILLIAMS,
[ct=460.831] ESTIME, MIMS IN THE
[ct=462.031] THEY ALREADY HAVE FOUR
[ct=463.970] GUYS ON RUNNING BACK
[ct=464.986] >> Kirk: THEY’RE
[ct=472.448] SEARCHING.
[ct=472.841] JESSE MANIPULATOR HAS
[ct=474.149] HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS.
[ct=474.982] WE’LL SEE HOW THEY’RE
[ct=476.761] ABLE TO HOLD UP.
[ct=477.719] THEY’RE PROTECTING
[ct=479.039] THEIR CORNERS TONIGHT
[ct=479.918] HAVING TO KEEP
[ct=482.387] SAFETIES BACK.
[ct=482.659] AND RIGHT NOW THE
[ct=483.013] BRONCOS ARE MAKING
[ct=484.464] THEM PAY FOR THAT,
[ct=485.552] TRYING TO GET THEM OUT
[ct=488.020] OF THAT LOOK WHERE
[ct=489.075] THEY CAN THROW THE
[ct=489.591] FOOTBALL MORE.
[ct=490.224] >> Al: 2nd DOWN AND 7.
[ct=492.910] WATSON EXPLOITS THAT
[ct=492.910] HOLE.
[ct=494.475] THROWS TO A FIRST DOWN
[ct=495.905] HERE.
[ct=495.905] BRONCOS ON THE MOVE
[ct=496.723] AFTER THE CHARGERS
[ct=498.554] STARTED THE GAME WITH
[ct=502.162] A 3 AND OUT.
[ct=502.802] >> Kirk: WATCH THIS.
[ct=503.045] YOU KNOW, COACH
[ct=505.277] WARNED -- SEAN PAYTON
[ct=506.055] WARNED US ABOUT THIS
[ct=507.090] YOUNG BACK, AND WATCH
[ct=508.293] THIS CUT RIGHT WHEN HE
[ct=509.137] GETS THIS FOOTBALL.
[ct=509.767] THIS CUT BACK RIGHT
[ct=510.962] HERE, THAT’S GREAT
[ct=512.834] VISION.
[ct=513.339] THAT’S REALLY A
[ct=515.037] STRENGTH OF HIS IS TO
[ct=515.407] FEEL THE
[ct=517.997] DEFENSE.
[ct=518.269] THEY’RE OVERFLOWING,
[ct=518.860] PLAY’S DESIGNED TO GO
[ct=519.466] RIGHT.
[ct=520.458] FEELS THE BLOCK IN,
[ct=521.574] CUTS IT BACK, AND GETS
[ct=522.863] THOSE GREAT YARDS.
[ct=525.195] ALMOST 7 YARDS A CARRY
[ct=526.715] >> Al: YEAH, HE HAD
[ct=528.027] ALMOST 100 YARDS LAST
[ct=530.729] YEAR AT MEMPHIS.
[ct=532.102] JAVOPT A.I. WILLIAMS
[ct=533.283] BACK IN.
[ct=533.829] COME UP TO THE PISTOL
[ct=535.182] FOR THE FIRST TIME.
[ct=535.743] PLAY CLOCK GOES TO
[ct=537.714] ZERO, ACTION UP FRONT,
[ct=541.812] PLAY WHISTLE DEAD.
[ct=544.068] CLAY MARTIN TELLS US
[ct=544.616] ITS BEEN POWERS TO
[ct=546.745] MAKE IT A 1st AND 15.
[ct=547.365] CLAY MARTIN, IT’S THE
[ct=548.995] THIRD TIME IN OUR LAST
[ct=549.821] FOUR GAMES HE’S
[ct=551.649] TRAVELING WITH US.
[ct=552.194] >> Kirk: EVERY WEEK.
[ct=553.979] EVERY WEEK HE’S WITH
[ct=556.383] US.
[ct=559.584] >> Al: SEEMS TO BE.
[ct=560.263] PAYTON CALLING IN THIS
[ct=560.562] PLAY.
[ct=561.152] THIS WOULD BE THE
[ct=562.200] NINTH PLAY OF THE
[ct=562.991] DRIVE.
[ct=563.682] ONLY TWO PASSES SO
[ct=565.055] FAR, SIX RUNS.
[ct=566.658] >> Kirk: THESE GUYS
[ct=567.477] RAN FOR 49 YARDS FOR
[ct=569.306] THE ENTIRE GAME
[ct=569.672] AGAINST THE COLTS LAST
[ct=570.853] WEEK, RIGHT?
[ct=571.528] >> Al: AGAINST A
[ct=572.560] CHARGER DEFENSE THAT
[ct=574.886] WAS SHREDDED BY TAMPA
[ct=576.061] BAY.
[ct=576.985] OFF THE FAKE, GOING
[ct=579.034] CATCH IS MADE, GOOD
[ct=581.412] BLOCKING, DOWN THE
[ct=581.729] SIDELINE.
[ct=583.713] THAT’S BLAKE WATSON.
[ct=585.500] FLAG COMES IN AT THE
[ct=586.865] END.
[ct=590.608] SO THAT WAS A 1st AND
[ct=592.114] 15.
[ct=594.542] PICKED UP 13 YARDS.
[ct=595.864] WE’LL SEE ABOUT THE
[ct=598.590] CALL BY MARTIN AS HE
[ct=599.871] GATHERS THE OFFICIALS.
[ct=619.762] NEED A TEAM MOVING IN
[ct=619.762] OTHER DIRECTION RIGHT
[ct=620.011] NOW.
[ct=620.406] SO TONY JEFFERSON
[ct=620.894] GETTING THE START
[ct=622.643] TONIGHT BECAUSE ELIJAH
[ct=625.319] MOLDEN IS DOWN.
[ct=625.778] >> Kirk: AGAIN, THIS
[ct=626.693] OFFENSIVE LINE AND
[ct=628.498] THESE YOUNG BACKS LOOK
[ct=629.840] TO BRING TERRY IN.
[ct=630.936] AND TERRY, WHAT DO YOU
[ct=633.790] SEE THERE?
[ct=634.404] >> KIRK, IT JUST LOOKS
[ct=635.398] LIKE A NORMAL SHOULDER
[ct=636.277] TO SHOULDER HIT.
[ct=637.079] THERE’S SOME CONTACT
[ct=638.042] TO THE HELMET.
[ct=640.654] I DON’T SEE HIM LOWER
[ct=641.115] HIS HEAD OR INITIATE
[ct=641.811] OR MAKE FORCIBLE
[ct=642.195] CONTACT TO THE
[ct=643.585] OPPONENT.
[ct=643.841] I REALLY DON’T SEE A
[ct=645.084] FOUL THERE.
[ct=645.776] >> Al: IT’S ABOUT A
[ct=647.620] 3-YARD PENALTY AS IT
[ct=648.374] TURNS OUT, HALF THE
[ct=649.202] DISTANCE.
[ct=649.668] ESTIME IS THE RUNNING
[ct=650.919] THEY GIVE IT TO HIM,
[ct=652.043] AND HE GOES IN FOR A
[ct=658.851] TOUCHDOWN, IN BEHIND
[ct=660.960] VAN POWERS.
[ct=662.731] SO THAT DRIVE CONSUMES
[ct=663.119] ALMOST 6 MINUTES, AND
[ct=664.583] THE CHARGERS WHO WERE
[ct=665.775] BURNED FOR ALMOST 500
[ct=666.718] YARDS LAST SUNDAY BY
[ct=669.641] TAMPA BAY START THE
[ct=669.641] SAME WAY TONIGHT.
[ct=670.971] EXACTLY RIGHT.
[ct=672.107] ALL THEY TALKED ALL
[ct=672.529] WEEK ABOUT WAS HAVING
[ct=673.664] A CHANCE TO AVENGE
[ct=675.246] LAST WEEK’S GAME.
[ct=675.962] LOOK AT THAT JOB,
[ct=685.797] AGAIN, BY MINERS, THE
[ct=686.219] RIGHT GUARD.
[ct=688.557] A TEAM THAT’S HEARD
[ct=689.014] ALL YEAR WHAT’S WRONG
[ct=689.898] WITH YOUR RUNNING
[ct=690.338] GAME.
[ct=691.745] THEY OPEN IT UP ON
[ct=693.699] THIS OPENING DRIVE,
[ct=694.289] THAT’S A HECK OF A
[ct=697.099] >> Al: ESTIME WITH HIS
[ct=700.493] FIRST NFL AUDIBLE.
[ct=704.536] >> Al: COULD YOU
[ct=705.812] COULDN’T.
[ct=705.994] >> Kirk: WE SEARCHED
[ct=706.524] HIGH AND LOW.
[ct=706.968] >> Al: ONE OF THE
[ct=707.718] GREATS OF ALL-TIME.
[ct=710.600] FORMER PARTNER OF MINE
[ct=714.815] BACK IN 2000, 2001.
[ct=719.000] MR. DAN FOUTS.
[ct=720.237] SO WILL LUTZ TO KICK
[ct=722.036] OFF AFTER THE BRONCOS
[ct=722.295] GO 72 YARDS.
[ct=723.459] AND THE CHARGERS WHO
[ct=724.567] WERE 3 AND OUT
[ct=726.432] OPPORTUNITY TAKE OVER
[ct=727.679] AT THE 30.
[ct=728.855] >> Kirk: WELL, LET’S
[ct=730.013] SEE HOW THIS CHARGERS
[ct=731.456] OFFENSE ANSWERS.
[ct=732.346] THIS IS A GAME THEY DO
[ct=733.428] NOT WANT TO GET AWAY
[ct=734.096] FROM THEM.
[ct=736.695] REPEATEDLY HOW LAST
[ct=737.658] WEEK FINISHED, THAT
[ct=738.458] SECOND HALF AGAINST
[ct=739.149] TAMPA AND HOW BOTH
[ct=740.230] SIDES OF THE FOOTBALL,
[ct=742.238] THEY WERE FRUSTRATED.
[ct=743.572] BUT AS A FIRST-YEAR
[ct=744.604] HEAD COACH THEY TALKED
[ct=746.142] ABOUT, GUYS, WE’RE
[ct=747.651] GOING TO HAVE WEEKS
[ct=748.805] LIKE THIS.
[ct=749.770] WHAT ARE WE GOING TO
[ct=751.162] DO ABOUT IT, AND HOW
[ct=753.054] DO YOU RESPOND TO IT?
[ct=754.622] THEY’RE DOWN 7-0 AFTER
[ct=758.481] ONE POSSESSION.
[ct=758.481] >> Al: THE CHARGERS
[ct=759.784] AFTER LAST WEEK GIVEN
[ct=760.484] UP 37 POINTS WITHOUT
[ct=761.978] SCORING.
[ct=762.414] HERBERT PLAY ACTION,
[ct=763.927] SWINGS IT OUT.
[ct=764.362] LOOKING FOR ROOM,
[ct=766.577] FINDS SOME IN THE
[ct=766.780] INSIDE.
[ct=767.889] NICE MOVE TO THE 41
[ct=771.744] GOES SCOTT MATLOCK.
[ct=773.290] MUCH LIKE PATRICK
[ct=774.620] RASHAD IN BALTIMORE HE
[ct=775.488] PLAYS OFFENSE AND
[ct=776.424] DEFENSE, ALL OVER THE
[ct=777.767] PLACE.
[ct=779.599] >> Kirk: HOW MUCH FUN
[ct=781.002] IS IT TO WATCH A 300
[ct=784.940] POUNDER IN THE BACK
[ct=785.868] FIELD.
[ct=786.050] HOUPT
[ct=786.879] HOW ABOUT THE NIFTY
[ct=788.042] MOVES THERE BY THE 300
[ct=789.300] POUNDER?
[ct=790.261] BY THE WAY, THIS GUY’S
[ct=791.525] PLAYED DEFENSIVE MOVES
[ct=792.969] HIS ENTIRE LIFE AND
[ct=796.019] MOVED HIM SECOND
[ct=796.204] DEFENSIVE GAME TO FULL
[ct=798.000] HE’S GETTING A BETTER
[ct=800.333] FEEL EVERY SINGLE WEEK
[ct=802.729] AND ROMAN AND HARBAUGH
[ct=803.730] ALWAYS HAVE THAT KIND
[ct=804.786] OF GUY IN THEIR
[ct=806.635] OFFENSE.
[ct=806.635] >> Al: SIXTH ROUND
[ct=807.377] PICK OUT OF BOISE
[ct=808.270] STATE A COUPLE OF
[ct=809.428] YEARS AGO.
[ct=810.235] AND MEANWHILE THAT IS
[ct=811.725] GUS EDWARDS, SHORT
[ct=812.605] GAIN.
[ct=814.948] TO KAYLEE WE GO.
[ct=815.207] >> AS THE CHARGERS
[ct=816.336] OFFENSE TRIES TO
[ct=817.441] FIGURE THINGS OUT,
[ct=818.901] THEIR SECONDARY IS,
[ct=819.441] TOO.
[ct=822.278] NOW ANOTHER, MARCUS
[ct=823.117] MAYE WHO YOU SAW GO
[ct=824.145] DOWN ON THAT LAST
[ct=825.676] DRIVE, HE’S NOW IN THE
[ct=826.989] X-RAY ROOM.
[ct=826.989] WE’RE TOLD HE’S
[ct=828.494] QUESTIONABLE TO RETURN
[ct=830.715] WITH AN ANKLE INJURY.
[ct=832.355] >> Al: CAM HART, HE’S
[ct=835.513] OUT OF THE GAME.
[ct=837.867] >> Kirk: GILMAN IS
[ct=839.657] OUT.
[ct=840.348] >> Al: NEEDS 3, GETS A
[ct=841.392] LOT MORE THAN THAT.
[ct=843.348] OFF TO THE RACES.
[ct=843.725] TRIPPED UP INSIDE THE
[ct=847.326] 40 YARD LINE GOES THE
[ct=848.930] ROOKIE OUT OF TROY,
[ct=850.353] SIXTH ROUND DRAFT
[ct=851.419] PICK.
[ct=852.569] >> Kirk: WELL, WE SAW
[ct=853.532] MATLOCK HAS A NICE
[ct=853.998] CATCH.
[ct=854.971] NOW HE GOES BACK TO
[ct=856.225] DOING WHAT HE SHOULD
[ct=857.974] DO, AND THAT’S LEADING
[ct=857.974] THE WAY FOR THE
[ct=859.996] RUNNING BACK.
[ct=862.133] AND VIDAL GIVES YOU A
[ct=862.846] LITTLE BIT MORE JUICE.
[ct=864.005] HE’S GOT A LOW CENTER
[ct=865.856] OF GRAVITY.
[ct=868.497] HE CAN GET YOU UP
[ct=871.028] FIELD A LOT QUICKER
[ct=873.744] THAN EDWARDS.
[ct=874.928] THIS IS MATLOCK AGAIN.
[ct=879.043] OPENS UP THAT LEFT
[ct=882.544] SIDE.
[ct=885.376] >> Al: VIDAL, 5’8" AND
[ct=886.202] 215.
[ct=887.593] BRING EDWARDS BACK IN.
[ct=888.938] EDWARDS PICKS UP ABOUT
[ct=889.976] >> Kirk: WHAT THEY’RE
[ct=891.537] TRYING TO DO TO THIS
[ct=892.689] DENVER DEFENSE IS NOT
[ct=896.205] EASILY DONE.
[ct=898.418] VANCE JOSEPH REALLY
[ct=898.942] SWITCHED THINGS AROUND
[ct=901.131] AS A COORDINATOR WITH
[ct=901.747] HIS DEFENSE IN YEAR
[ct=901.994] TWO.
[ct=902.916] IN THE PAST NOT TO BE
[ct=904.541] TOO TECHNICAL.
[ct=905.241] MEANING THE DEFENSIVE
[ct=905.903] LINE WOULD GET THEIR
[ct=907.062] HANDS ON THE OFFENSIVE
[ct=907.846] LINE AND KIND OF LOOK
[ct=909.260] INTO THE BACKFIELD,
[ct=909.746] FREE UP THE LINE
[ct=910.836] BACKERS TO MAKE ALL
[ct=911.787] THE TACKLES.
[ct=912.633] NOW IT’S MORE PIN
[ct=913.563] THEIR EARS AND GET
[ct=914.341] UPFIELD.
[ct=915.816] AND WITH THE ADDITION
[ct=918.072] OF JOHN FRANKLIN-MYERS
[ct=919.441] AND MALCOLM ROACH,
[ct=921.241] IT’S A VERY, VERY
[ct=922.252] DIFFICULT DEFENSE TO
[ct=924.348] RUN ON.
[ct=926.632] >> Al: 2nd AND 8.
[ct=927.763] HERBERT, GOOD
[ct=928.896] PROTECTION, WIDE OPEN,
[ct=931.469] MAKING THE GRAB, BUT
[ct=932.008] TAKEN DOWN A COUPLE OF
[ct=933.037] YARDS SHY OF THE FIRST
[ct=935.717] DOWN IS QUENTIN
[ct=936.798] JOHNSON.
[ct=936.979] WE SHOULD POINT OUT
[ct=937.544] BOTH OF THESE TEAMS
[ct=938.475] AND ALONG WITH THE
[ct=939.745] PHILADELPHIA EAGLE,
[ct=940.888] LEAD THE LEAGUE IN
[ct=941.891] FEWEST POINTS ALLOWED
[ct=942.945] COMING INTO THIS GAME.
[ct=943.777] >> Kirk: YEAH, THEY
[ct=944.534] ARE DOING A GOOD JOB
[ct=945.299] NOT JUST AGAINST THE
[ct=946.309] RUN, BUT I THINK
[ct=946.644] THEY’RE PLAYING WITH A
[ct=948.011] LOT MORE CONFIDENCE IN
[ct=948.526] WHAT THEY’RE ABLE TO
[ct=950.553] DO IN THIS ATTACK.
[ct=951.581] YOU KNOW, VANCE
[ct=954.276] JOSEPH, BEEN AROUND
[ct=954.596] THE NFL FOR A LONG
[ct=955.229] TIME, AND I THINK THE
[ct=956.000] GUYS REALLY ARE
[ct=957.581] FEEDING OFF OF HIS
[ct=958.708] POSITIVITY AND HIS
[ct=959.179] ENERGY MUCH BETTER
[ct=961.140] THIS YEAR.
[ct=961.745] >> Al: QUICK PACE
[ct=964.782] DENVER ALMOST OFFSIDE.
[ct=964.782] MEANWHILE THE CATCH IS
[ct=966.058] MADE.
[ct=966.562] TO THE 3 YARD LINE
[ct=971.177] GOES JOSHUA PALMER.
[ct=973.413] FOURTH YEAR, STEADY.
[ct=973.894] MEANWHILE, THERE WAS A
[ct=975.872] FLAG FOR OFFSIDE.
[ct=977.016] THOUGHT DENVER WERE
[ct=978.500] OFFSIDE, AND THEY
[ct=979.126] WERE.
[ct=979.676] >> Kirk: YEAH, GOT A
[ct=981.484] FREE PLAY THERE WITH
[ct=983.070] BONITTO JUMPING.
[ct=983.978] >> Al: SO WITH 4:06 TO
[ct=985.729] PLAY IN THE QUARTER, A
[ct=991.030] GAIN OF 24 YARDS AND A
[ct=992.609] 1st AND GOAL FOR LOS
[ct=992.896] ANGELES.
[ct=993.749] DEFENSE, EYES IN THE
[ct=994.378] BACKFIELD OFF THIS
[ct=994.996] PLAY ACTION GAME, AND
[ct=995.321] BECAUSE OF THAT
[ct=995.746] THERE’S A NICE OPENING
[ct=996.761] BEHIND THE LINE
[ct=998.718] BACKERS AND THE SAFETY
[ct=1001.424] 6, P.J. LOCKE
[ct=1002.166] AND THIS IS A PLAY,
[ct=1003.389] JUSTIN HERBERT IS AS
[ct=1005.216] GOOD AS ANYBODY IN
[ct=1006.284] THAT THE TIMING AND
[ct=1006.454] THE RHYTHM.
[ct=1007.842] HE PUTS IT RIGHT ON
[ct=1009.732] THE MONEY.
[ct=1011.730] >> Al: HE’S 4 FOR 4
[ct=1012.881] OVER 43 YARDS.
[ct=1013.998] ON THE GROUND, TO THE
[ct=1017.365] MIDDLE, TO THE 1.
[ct=1019.141] GUS EDWARDS TO MAKE IT
[ct=1019.376] 2nd DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=1021.210] THIS IS THE EIGHTH
[ct=1021.883] PLAY OF THIS DRIVE
[ct=1023.085] UPCOMING.
[ct=1023.414] >> Kirk: THIS HAS BEEN
[ct=1024.355] A GREAT DRIVE AND A
[ct=1025.186] GREAT ANSWER.
[ct=1025.663] SEE IF THEY CAN FINISH
[ct=1026.672] THIS OFF.
[ct=1028.404] NOW, THIS DENVER
[ct=1030.680] DEFENSE SECOND IN THE
[ct=1031.862] ENTIRE LEAGUE IN
[ct=1032.822] DEFENDING TEAMS IN
[ct=1034.484] THIS RED ZONE AREA,
[ct=1035.118] PREVENTING THEM FROM
[ct=1036.188] PUTTING TOUCHDOWNS ON
[ct=1036.810] THE BOARD.
[ct=1037.828] BUT RIGHT NOW THIS
[ct=1038.482] CHARGERS OFFENSE HAS A
[ct=1041.756] LOT OF MOMENTUM.
[ct=1044.899] >> Al: ELWARDS THE
[ct=1047.894] RUNNING BACK, FIRST IN
[ct=1048.601] MOTION.
[ct=1050.040] GOT A LOT OF LEVERAGE
[ct=1050.689] COMING OUT OF THAT
[ct=1052.711] BACKFIELD.
[ct=1053.240] AND CAN HE LEAN INTO
[ct=1054.400] THE TOUCHDOWN?
[ct=1056.556] YES, HE CAN!
[ct=1058.375] GUS EDWARDS STOPPED
[ct=1059.744] JUST OUTSIDE THE GOAL
[ct=1061.287] LINE, THEN THAT LITTLE
[ct=1061.631] LEAN WITH THE
[ct=1063.263] SHOULDER, AND IN HE
[ct=1064.478] GOES.
[ct=1064.485] >> Kirk: I’LL TELL YOU
[ct=1065.528] WHAT, I WAS SHOCKED
[ct=1066.616] THAT HE WAS ABLE TO
[ct=1067.516] USE HIS POWER.
[ct=1068.449] JIM HARBAUGH’S GOT TO
[ct=1070.532] BE FIRED UP.
[ct=1071.928] CODY BARTON HITS HIM
[ct=1073.396] AT ABOUT THE 2 YARD
[ct=1075.236] THIS GIVES YOU AN IDEA
[ct=1076.324] OF THE STRENGTH OF
[ct=1077.602] EDWARDS.
[ct=1078.184] HE GETS HIT RIGHT
[ct=1079.583] THERE, 2 OR 3 YARD
[ct=1082.673] LINE, BUT KEEPS HIS
[ct=1084.471] BALANCE, KEEPS MOVING
[ct=1084.785] THOSE LEGS AND GETS
[ct=1085.210] ACROSS THE GOAL LINE
[ct=1088.619] FOR ITTHE TOUCH DOWN.
[ct=1091.931] WATCH 55 GOES DOWN,
[ct=1093.067] CLEAN, GOOD LEVERAGE.
[ct=1093.745] I THINK THEY’RE GOING
[ct=1095.251] TO CHECK TO MAKE SURE
[ct=1096.142] THE BALL BROKE THE
[ct=1097.855] PLANE, AND LOOKED LIKE
[ct=1099.231] IT DID.
[ct=1102.779] >> Al: IT’S CONFIRMED,
[ct=1103.013] MATLOCK WAS ALSO
[ct=1105.465] INVOLVED IN THAT
[ct=1106.548] ACTION.
[ct=1107.581] CAMERON DICKER FOR THE
[ct=1110.031] EXTRA POINT TO TIE IT
[ct=1110.502] UP.
[ct=1111.456] AND AFTER GIVING UP
[ct=1113.060] THE LAST 37 POINTS
[ct=1114.792] OVER TWO WEEKS, THE
[ct=1119.637] CHARGERS NEEDED THAT MR. BEAST
[ct=1119.831] HIMSELF, JIMMY
[ct=1121.068] DONALDSON FROM NORTH
[ct=1121.638] CAROLINA GEARING UP
[ct=1123.872] FOR THE TWO-EPISODE
[ct=1126.076] PREMIER FOLLOWING THE
[ct=1126.315] GAME TONIGHT.
[ct=1127.035] >> Kirk: WOW, TONIGHT.
[ct=1128.177] IS IT COOL?
[ct=1129.967] >> Al: IT’S VERY COOL.
[ct=1130.620] >> Kirk: THAT’S THE
[ct=1132.033] MOST EXCITED YOU’VE
[ct=1135.281] BEEN IN THREE YEARS.
[ct=1135.726] >> Al: KIRK, IT SAYS
[ct=1137.146] PROMOS COMING UP.
[ct=1137.911] >> Kirk: YOU’RE FIRED
[ct=1139.531] EVEN IN THE MEETING
[ct=1140.509] YOU’RE LIKE --
[ct=1142.502] >> Al: I KNOW THIS
[ct=1144.362] GUY.
[ct=1146.061] >> Kirk: ALL OVER THAT
[ct=1146.790] >> Al: HE’S BECOME A
[ct=1148.564] MAJOR ENTERPRISE.
[ct=1149.149] >> Kirk: I’M GOING TO
[ct=1152.207] DO A LITTLE RESEARCH.
[ct=1152.839] BY NEXT YEAR I’M GOING
[ct=1153.874] TO BE READY FOR
[ct=1156.484] CHICAGO.
[ct=1156.900] IF YOU’RE JUST TUNING
[ct=1157.993] IN WHAT A GREAT DRIVE
[ct=1160.837] BY THE DENVER BRONCOS.
[ct=1162.516] THIS IS A TEAM THAT’S
[ct=1162.891] BEEN CRITICIZED ABOUT
[ct=1163.590] THEIR INABILITY TO RUN
[ct=1165.181] THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=1165.875] SEAN PAYTON A LOT OF
[ct=1167.731] PERSONNEL.
[ct=1167.979] SOME SCREENS, BUT
[ct=1169.113] REALLY IT WAS THE
[ct=1170.327] CONTROLLING THE LINE
[ct=1170.925] OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=1171.863] THEY KNOW ABOUT JIM
[ct=1174.724] HARBAUGH’S REPUTATION.
[ct=1174.724] BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE
[ct=1175.374] THEY LIKE TO PRIDE
[ct=1177.344] THEMSELVES ON WINNING
[ct=1178.260] AND BEING PHYSICAL AS
[ct=1179.330] WELL, AND THEY SURE
[ct=1180.476] WERE ON THAT OPENING
[ct=1184.672] DRIVE TO KIND OF SET A
[ct=1187.348] TONE.
[ct=1188.873] >> Al: NIX, DEEP DROP.
[ct=1191.305] SWINGS IT OUT,
[ct=1193.944] TACKLE’S MADE JUST
[ct=1193.944] AFTER THE CATCH IS
[ct=1197.923] MADE BY WILLIAMS.
[ct=1202.300] KRISTIAN FULTON COMES
[ct=1202.703] UP THERE TO STOP HIM
[ct=1204.996] AFTER A GAIN OF 2.
[ct=1207.753] >> Kirk: SAMUEL IS
[ct=1208.832] OUT, CAM HART IS OUT
[ct=1209.820] TONIGHT PLAYING
[ct=1214.863] ROOKIE, AND TARHEEB
[ct=1217.607] HILL.
[ct=1218.947] HE LIKES TO PLAY
[ct=1220.658] MAN-TO-MAN BUT PLAYING
[ct=1221.035] MORE ZONE BECAUSE OF
[ct=1222.077] THE CORNERS AND GOT TO
[ct=1222.602] PROTECT HIM.
[ct=1223.330] THAT MEANS YOU’RE
[ct=1224.328] GOING TO SEE A LOT OF
[ct=1225.295] THE SAFETIES BACK OFF
[ct=1226.212] HIM.
[ct=1226.491] I THINK HOW
[ct=1228.052] WILL ATTACK BECAUSE OF
[ct=1229.653] THAT BECOMES
[ct=1229.910] INTERESTING.
[ct=1230.645] NOT TO MENTION THEY
[ct=1231.652] WANT TO DISGUISE AND
[ct=1233.242] CONFUSE BO NIX.
[ct=1234.294] >> Al: EXTRA PRESSURE.
[ct=1235.101] BLOCK IS MADE UP
[ct=1235.672] FRONT.
[ct=1236.974] THE PASS IS A LITTLE
[ct=1239.522] BIT LOW.
[ct=1239.522] INTENDED THERE FOR
[ct=1240.776] TROY FRANKLIN, NIX’S
[ct=1242.624] TEAMMATE AT OREGON AND
[ct=1243.766] INCOMPLETE.
[ct=1245.501] 3rd DOWN AND 9.
[ct=1246.409] >> Kirk: THE OTHER
[ct=1247.025] THING TO THINK ABOUT
[ct=1248.791] IS DERWIN JAMES
[ct=1249.738] THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER
[ct=1251.086] HE PLAYS NICKEL, HE
[ct=1254.504] PLAYS SAFETY, HE PLAYS
[ct=1254.504] LINEBACKER.
[ct=1255.713] HE IS EVERYWHERE.
[ct=1256.589] WITH JESSE MINTER,
[ct=1257.506] IT’S A LITTLE BIT MORE
[ct=1258.405] SPECIFIC.
[ct=1260.816] HE AND DERWIN JAMES
[ct=1262.725] MEET ALL WEEK.
[ct=1262.725] WHAT HIS ROLE IS
[ct=1263.348] VARIES ON THE
[ct=1266.061] TONIGHT HE’S PLAYING A
[ct=1267.019] LITTLE BIT MORE SAFETY
[ct=1267.414] BECAUSE OF THE

[ct=1271.524] DOWN, HE’LL DEFINITELY
[ct=1273.362] HAVE TO PLAY BACK MORE
[ct=1274.091] THAN HE WOULD NORMALLY
[ct=1276.260] PLAY UPTIGHT.
[ct=1276.260] >> Al: THERE HE IS, 8
[ct=1277.549] YARDS FROM THE LINE OF
[ct=1278.281] SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=1281.734] GOING TO KEEP IT AFTER

[ct=1283.148] AND PICKS UP THE FIRST
[ct=1284.443] DOWN WITH HIS LEGS
[ct=1286.000] AFTER AT THE 43 YARD
[ct=1288.247] >> Kirk: JUST TALKING

[ct=1290.136] AND YOU’RE RIGHT HE
[ct=1291.423] STARTED TO SNEAK DOWN
[ct=1293.152] AFTER THIS PLAY.
[ct=1294.222] WATCH THE PUMP FAKE BY
[ct=1295.941] THIS IS WHERE HE’S SO
[ct=1296.753] DANGEROUS.
[ct=1298.471] HE’S ELUSIVE.
[ct=1299.190] HE’S PAST THE LINE OF
[ct=1300.503] SCRIMMAGE, PUMP FAKE.
[ct=1304.746] AND THE VETERAN,
[ct=1304.899] AND THE VETERAN DERWIN
[ct=1306.336] JAMES FALLS FOR IT.
[ct=1307.504] JUST PLAYING THAT
[ct=1308.540] LITTLE BASKETBALL ON
[ct=1309.262] GRASS, RIGHT?
[ct=1310.952] HE GIVES HIM A LITTLE
[ct=1312.302] PUMP FAKE, HEAD FAKE
[ct=1313.553] AND ENOUGH TO GET THAT
[ct=1316.698] FIRST DOWN, NICE PLAY.
[ct=1320.101] >> Al: 1:40 IN THE
[ct=1320.728] QUARTER.
[ct=1321.629] NICE MOVE ZIGGING AND
[ct=1323.001] ZAGGING AND FINDING AN
[ct=1324.233] OPEN SPOT.
[ct=1324.917] ESTIME SCORED THE
[ct=1325.908] TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=1327.408] PICK UP THERE AT 9.
[ct=1328.171] >> Kirk: I THINK THIS
[ct=1329.342] GUY CAN BE A GREAT PRO
[ct=1331.091] IF YOU WATCHED HIM IN
[ct=1332.715] COLLEGE AT NOER DAME
[ct=1334.541] YOU KNOW HE’S GOT THE
[ct=1335.929] SIZE AND VISION.
[ct=1336.652] HE FEELS THAT, PUTS
[ct=1337.546] THE BRAKES ON THAT
[ct=1338.721] BLOCK, AND GOES UNDER
[ct=1339.757] THE BLOCK THAT’S ON
[ct=1341.246] KHALIL MACK.
[ct=1342.309] THAT’S GREAT PATIENCE,
[ct=1342.709] GREAT VISION.
[ct=1344.047] AND A LOT OF TIMES
[ct=1345.393] RUNNING BACKS, ROOKIES
[ct=1346.394] MAKE UP THEIR MIND AND
[ct=1347.293] THEY RUN.
[ct=1348.643] THAT’S AN EXAMPLE OF
[ct=1348.836] HIM BEING PATIENT,
[ct=1350.397] LETTING THE BLOCKS
[ct=1351.104] ESTABLISH THEMSELVES
[ct=1352.045] AND GETTING BEHIND TO
[ct=1353.347] THE LEVERAGE AT HIS
[ct=1354.633] ADVANTAGE.

[ct=1378.046] ACTUALLY FIVE GUYS
[ct=1379.290] HAVE CARRIED THE BALL
[ct=1379.836] ALREADY.
[ct=1380.668] >> Kirk: WE’VE SEEN
[ct=1381.939] MIMS IN THAT ROLE THE
[ct=1382.984] LAST THREE OR FOUR
[ct=1384.067] WEEKS WHERE HE’S HAD
[ct=1385.228] OPPORTUNITY TO GET IN
[ct=1386.580] THAT BACK FIELD.
[ct=1389.526] I’M WITH YOU, IT’S A
[ct=1391.209] REVOLVING DOOR RIGHT
[ct=1393.131] ONE THING THAT’S
[ct=1394.140] CONSTANT IS THAT
[ct=1395.129] OFFENSIVE LINE AT THE
[ct=1397.433] LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=1401.236] >> Al: I LIKE MIKE

[ct=1402.744] OF LABOR.
[ct=1404.343] WHERE THAT PASS IS,

[ct=1419.768] THE ATHLETIC ABILITY.
[ct=1421.071] AGAIN, TALKING TO
[ct=1422.992] JESSE MINTER, I FOUND
[ct=1423.466] IT REALLY COOL TO HEAR

[ct=1846.273] WAS READY BY OPENING
[ct=1846.433] DAY.
[ct=1848.505] 3rd AND 5.
[ct=1849.071] THEY GO NO HUDDLE
[ct=1850.465] >> Kirk: A LITTLE
[ct=1852.668] TEMPO, YEP.
[ct=1854.168] >> Al: FOUR-MAN RUSH.
[ct=1855.567] THROWS, CAUGHT.
[ct=1857.934] FIRST DOWN, AND THAT
[ct=1860.163] IS STONE SMART, TIGHT
[ct=1863.252] SO STONE SMART
[ct=1864.007] ASSUMING THE ROLE AS
[ct=1864.695] THE NUMBER ONE TIGHT
[ct=1866.192] AND HERBERT NOW HAS
[ct=1867.659] COMPLETED SIX PASSES
[ct=1868.413] TO SIX DIFFERENT
[ct=1870.181] RECEIVERS.
[ct=1871.455] >> Kirk: YEP.
[ct=1871.905] MESH CONCEPT.
[ct=1872.726] COUPLE OF RECEIVERS
[ct=1873.542] CROSSING.
[ct=1874.720] NOBODY PICKS HIM UP.
[ct=1876.976] THE REASON YOU SAW
[ct=1877.630] TEMPO, THAT’S TO
[ct=1878.727] PREVENT THE BRONCOS
[ct=1879.165] FROM GETTING THEIR
[ct=1880.277] NICKEL OR THEIR DIME
[ct=1881.675] PACKAGE IN.
[ct=1884.017] SO THEY HAD TO STICK
[ct=1884.371] WITH THEIR BASE
[ct=1884.937] THAT’S AN ADVANTAGE
[ct=1885.522] FOR THE CHARGERS AND A
[ct=1886.437] GOOD JOB THERE BY GREG
[ct=1887.402] ROMAN GOING WITH THAT
[ct=1889.248] TEMPO LOOK.
[ct=1889.452] >> Al: OUT OF THE
[ct=1890.585] PISTOL THIS TIME.
[ct=1892.390] EDWARDS IS THE RUNNING
[ct=1894.731] GIVE IT TO HIM.
[ct=1895.444] TRIES TO CUT IT BACK,
[ct=1902.500] TAKES IT TO THE 23.
[ct=1903.271] ELLIS, 52, AND LOOK AT
[ct=1904.276] GREG ROMAN.
[ct=1905.525] >> Kirk: GREG ROMAN
[ct=1906.533] WELL RESPECTED.
[ct=1907.120] DOES A GOOD JOB.
[ct=1909.345] LIKE I SAID HE GOES
[ct=1910.555] ALL THE WAY BACK TO
[ct=1911.046] JIM HARBAUGH.
[ct=1915.465] STANFORD DAYS WHEN
[ct=1916.605] LOCKE WAS A
[ct=1917.598] QUARTERBACK AND IN SAN
[ct=1918.144] FRANCISCO HAD GREAT
[ct=1918.689] YEARS THERE AND NOW
[ct=1921.859] BACK WITH HIM NOW THAT
[ct=1922.680] HARBAUGH IS BACK IN
[ct=1923.312] THE NFL LEADING THE
[ct=1923.852] UNIVERSITY OF
[ct=1925.535] MICHIGAN.
[ct=1927.276] >> Al: NOW YOU’VE GOT
[ct=1930.622] HASSAN HASKENS IN THE
[ct=1931.440] BACKFIELD FOR THE
[ct=1932.331] FIRST TIME.
[ct=1933.083] A LITTLE SIDE ARM
[ct=1933.786] THROW.
[ct=1935.125] SMART AGAIN TRYING TO
[ct=1935.976] WORK HIS WAY FOR A
[ct=1938.828] VERY CLOSE.
[ct=1939.669] >> Kirk: I DON’T KNOW
[ct=1940.046] THERE’S ANYBODY AS
[ct=1941.802] GOOD.
[ct=1942.454] I MEAN THERE ARE A LOT
[ct=1942.794] OF GREAT QUARTERBACKS
[ct=1943.353] OUT THERE, BUT THIS
[ct=1944.357] GUY ON PLAY ACTION AND
[ct=1946.557] THE SCREEN GAME, WATCH
[ct=1947.165] THE MECHANICS, AND
[ct=1947.973] WATCH HIM SELL THIS.
[ct=1949.019] LOOKING RIGHT, LOOKING
[ct=1950.390] RIGHT, AND THEN SLIPS
[ct=1952.695] LIKE YOU SAID KIND OF
[ct=1953.575] THAT -- CHANGES THE
[ct=1955.721] ARM ANGLE, SIDE ARM
[ct=1956.231] AROUND THE DEFENDER.
[ct=1958.523] KNOWS HE’S COMING THE
[ct=1958.738] WHOLE TIME.
[ct=1959.175] JUST FLIPS IT RIGHT
[ct=1959.847] AROUND HIM, AND
[ct=1961.140] THERE’S AGAIN SMART
[ct=1961.990] LOOKING FOR A CHANCE
[ct=1962.791] TO GET HIS HANDS ON
[ct=1967.088] >> Al: 9:30 LEFT IN
[ct=1968.454] THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=1969.430] THIRD DOWN AND INCHES.
[ct=1969.939] MATLOCK STEPS UP.
[ct=1971.233] IN THE SLOT, GOES
[ct=1972.926] HAND THE BALL TO
[ct=1974.660] EDWARDS, AND HE IS
[ct=1975.310] STOPPED IN THE
[ct=1977.071] SO THEY HAD LEVERAGE
[ct=1978.778] THERE, BUT ZACH ALLEN
[ct=1980.018] SAID YOU AIN’T GOING
[ct=1981.110] ANYWHERE.
[ct=1981.516] >> Kirk: WOW.
[ct=1984.094] THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE.
[ct=1985.319] I MEAN, THAT’S JUST
[ct=1987.046] ANTICIPATING THE SNAP
[ct=1987.772] COUNT.
[ct=1989.445] GOOD JOB OF DEALING
[ct=1989.797] WITH THAT JUMBO LOOK.
[ct=1991.039] LOOK AT THE SIZE.
[ct=1992.268] AND HERE’S ALLEN RIGHT
[ct=1993.966] HE JUST GOT OFF THE
[ct=1995.095] BALL A LOT QUICKER
[ct=1997.551] THAN ANYBODY ELSE,
[ct=1998.914] JUST WANTED THE LINE
[ct=2001.828] BUT GET OFF SALYER,
[ct=2002.412] COMPLETELY SURPRISED.
[ct=2003.436] AND SET THE EDGE ON
[ct=2004.426] THE OTHER SIDE,
[ct=2005.445] NOWHERE TO GO.
[ct=2006.169] REALLY GOOD DEFENSE
[ct=2008.958] >> Al: HAVE TO SETTLE
[ct=2009.523] FOR A 37 YARD FIELD
[ct=2010.754] GOAL ATTEMPT BY
[ct=2012.154] CAMERON DICKER.
[ct=2013.243] SO THEY WENT PICKS.
[ct=2014.684] HE AND SEAN PAYTON
[ct=2015.500] START TO REALIZE WHAT
[ct=2016.696] HE’S GOING TO DO WELL,
[ct=2017.460] WHAT HE’S SAYING.
[ct=2018.299] LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE
[ct=2019.664] IN HOW HE’S BEEN ABLE
[ct=2020.666] TO PLAY, AND EVEN
[ct=2021.469] TONIGHT, JUST THE
[ct=2022.283] COMMAND OF THIS
[ct=2023.143] OFFENSE, JUST THE
[ct=2023.859] CONFIDENCE THAT HE
[ct=2024.045] EXUDES.
[ct=2025.896] I MEAN, IT’S -- IT’S
[ct=2026.479] PRETTY SPECIAL WHEN
[ct=2028.177] YOU SEE A ROOKIE
[ct=2028.323] QUARTERBACK PLAY THE
[ct=2031.216] WAY THIS GUY IS.
[ct=2031.927] >> Al: PLAYED FIVE
[ct=2033.926] YEARS IN COLLEGE,
[ct=2035.291] THREE IN AUBURN, TWO
[ct=2037.654] AT OREGON AFTER THAT.
[ct=2038.267] WHAT, 61 GAMES HE
[ct=2040.482] PLAYED IN COLLEGE?
[ct=2041.507] >> Kirk: YEAH, I THINK
[ct=2042.113] THAT EXPERIENCE REALLY
[ct=2042.650] HELPS HIM.
[ct=2043.389] HE’S BEEN THROUGH A
[ct=2044.777] LOT OF ADVERSITY.
[ct=2045.560] HIS THREE YEARS AT
[ct=2046.634] AUBURN, IT WAS HIS
[ct=2047.215] DREAM SCHOOL.
[ct=2048.073] HE BASICALLY LEFT
[ct=2048.731] THERE AND SAID I’VE
[ct=2051.543] HAD ENOUGH OF THIS AND
[ct=2052.678] WENT OUT TO EUGENE,
[ct=2053.386] OREGON, AND CHANGED
[ct=2055.214] HIS ENTIRE CAREER WHEN
[ct=2055.820] HE WENT OUT TO PLAY
[ct=2056.881] FOR THE DUCKS AND GAVE
[ct=2057.594] HIM THIS OPPORTUNITY
[ct=2058.905] WHERE HE’S NOW A FIRST
[ct=2059.761] ROUND DRAFT PICK AND
[ct=2060.917] PLAYING FOR SEAN
[ct=2063.044] PAYTON IN DENVER.
[ct=2063.407] MAN, THIS GUY JUST
[ct=2064.654] GREW UP WITH THE GAME.
[ct=2065.482] IN THE LOCKER ROOM
[ct=2066.905] WITH HIS DAD SINCE
[ct=2067.812] PROBABLY HE WAS 5
[ct=2068.390] YEARS OLD.
[ct=2069.708] JUST A COACH’S SON,
[ct=2071.866] THE EPITOME OF THAT.
[ct=2072.711] >> Al: WILLIAMS IS THE
[ct=2073.901] RUNNING BACK, AS THEY
[ct=2078.612] BEGIN THIS DRIVE.
[ct=2078.884] BRONCOS TWO LONG
[ct=2080.335] TOUCHDOWN DRIVES START
[ct=2082.070] WILLIAMS LOOKING FOR A
[ct=2083.285] BLOCK, GETS IT.
[ct=2085.441] PICKS UP ABOUT 4.
[ct=2086.174] TART MAKING THE
[ct=2089.489] WE GO TO KAYLEE.
[ct=2090.261] >> GUYS, FROM THE DAY
[ct=2091.815] COURTLAND SUTTON MET
[ct=2093.731] BO NIX HE’S FELT HE’S
[ct=2096.814] MATURE FOR A ROOKIE.
[ct=2097.754] SUTTON TOLD ME IT’S
[ct=2099.643] IMPRESSED HIM TO WATCH
[ct=2100.753] KNICKS’S STYLE OF
[ct=2104.852] LEADERSHIP.
[ct=2105.298] KNICKS HAS STAYED TRUE
[ct=2107.359] TO WHO HE IS.
[ct=2107.553] HE’S CONFIDENT,
[ct=2108.342] COMPETITIVE, NOT
[ct=2109.148] AFRAID TO SPEAK HIS
[ct=2109.767] MIND AND THAT’S
[ct=2111.069] ALLOWED HIM TO TAKE
[ct=2112.027] CONTROL OF THIS LOCKER
[ct=2113.302] ROOM AND THAT SIDLINE
[ct=2114.356] AS YOU’VE SEEN ALL
[ct=2117.268] >> Al: YOU CAN SEE
[ct=2118.560] THAT VISUALLY.
[ct=2120.202] LET’S GO BACK TO DON’T
[ct=2121.735] FORGET RUSSELL WILSON
[ct=2123.030] CAME IN FOR TWO YEARS,
[ct=2124.566] OKAY?
[ct=2124.566] TREMENDOUS TRADE, THE
[ct=2125.653] WHOLE THING DID NOT
[ct=2126.345] WORK OUT.
[ct=2127.359] SO NOW THEY HAD TO GO
[ct=2128.846] TO THE DRAFT.
[ct=2133.435] MEANWHILE, YOU HAD
[ct=2133.830] JARRETT STIDHAM WHO
[ct=2136.163] BACKED UP IN NEW
[ct=2136.364] ENGLAND.
[ct=2137.175] YOU HAD ZACK WILSON
[ct=2138.691] WHO WAS A STARTER AND
[ct=2139.275] JETS CHOICE A FEW
[ct=2140.172] YEARS BACK, AND IT WAS
[ct=2141.704] A COMPETITION.
[ct=2143.067] BUT EARLY ON IN THE
[ct=2143.233] COMPETITION YOU COULD
[ct=2143.615] FEEL IT.
[ct=2144.911] AND SEAN PAYTON TOLD
[ct=2145.901] US I KIND OF KNEW
[ct=2148.612] I KIND OF KNEW IT, AND
[ct=2150.028] THEN I HAD TO WAIT
[ct=2150.028] LATER IN TRAINING
[ct=2151.306] CAMP, LATER IN FREE
[ct=2152.697] SEASON TO MAKE THE
[ct=2154.645] OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT.
[ct=2155.860] AND MEANWHILE, MIMS
[ct=2157.430] WAS THERE.
[ct=2158.045] POONA FORD HAVING A
[ct=2159.079] FINE SEASON, KNOCKING
[ct=2159.288] IT DOWN.
[ct=2161.362] GOING TO BE 3rd DOWN
[ct=2162.487] AND 11.
[ct=2163.746] >> Kirk: I THINK SEAN
[ct=2164.915] PAYTON SAW IT AND FELT
[ct=2165.970] IT, BUT I THINK MORE
[ct=2166.468] IMPORTANTLY THE
[ct=2167.468] VETERANS ON THE TEAM
[ct=2168.380] WERE TALKING TO SEAN
[ct=2169.927] PAYTON AND VANCE
[ct=2172.079] JOSEPH AND SAYING
[ct=2172.928] AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS
[ct=2175.951] OF OTA’S PRIVATELY,
[ct=2176.478] HEY, MAN, WE’VE GOT A
[ct=2178.400] AND SO LONG WAY TO GO,
[ct=2180.039] GREAT GAMES.
[ct=2182.293] 14-10, BUT HE’S AN
[ct=2183.586] IMPRESSIVE PLAYER.
[ct=2183.968] WE’LL SEE HOW THIS
[ct=2184.846] CHARGERS DEFENSE
[ct=2185.066] LOOKING FOR A BREAK,
[ct=2186.380] LOOKING TO GET OFF THE
[ct=2188.923] FIELD AND GET A STOP.
[ct=2195.652] >> Al: 3rd AND 11.
[ct=2195.831] DEEP DROP.
[ct=2200.711] CHECKS IT DOWN.
[ct=2202.353] AND FINAL THRUST HAS
[ct=2204.213] NETTED THE FIRST DOWN
[ct=2206.455] FOR JAVONTE WILLIAMS.
[ct=2207.044] STILL MAKING THE
[ct=2209.707] NEEDED 11, GOT IT.
[ct=2212.763] >> Kirk: BO NIX HADN’T
[ct=2213.616] BEEN TOUCHED TONIGHT.
[ct=2214.507] HE’S A GUY PRETTY
[ct=2215.721] DECISIVE, HAS GOOD
[ct=2216.303] FEET.
[ct=2217.349] THIS TIME MACK IS
[ct=2220.344] DOUBLE-TEAMED.
[ct=2221.537] ADKINS HELPING OUT.
[ct=2222.426] HE HAS TIME TO SELL IT
[ct=2223.734] DOWNFIELD, CHECKS IT
[ct=2224.393] DOWN, ANOTHER SMART
[ct=2225.655] AND WHAT A JOB THERE
[ct=2227.897] BY WILLIAMS OF GETTING
[ct=2229.472] NORTH AND SOUTH AFTER
[ct=2229.935] THAT CATCH AND KNOWING
[ct=2230.433] EXACTLY WHERE HE
[ct=2231.564] NEEDED TO GO FOR THAT
[ct=2233.550] >> Al: YOU’RE RIGHT,
[ct=2234.991] CHARGERS WITH NO RUSH
[ct=2236.861] LAST WEEK.
[ct=2237.381] AND BAKER MAYFIELD
[ct=2238.504] BARELY HAD A SHOWER
[ct=2240.814] AFTER THAT SECOND
[ct=2242.215] HALF.
[ct=2242.215] MEANWHILE, IT’S MIMES
[ct=2243.868] DOWN THE SIDELINE.
[ct=2245.054] MIMS STAYS INBOUNDS,
[ct=2245.718] BEING CHASED ALL THE
[ct=2247.958] WAY TO THE 3 YARD LINE
[ct=2250.551] BY DERWIN JAMES.
[ct=2254.446] FINALLY STOPS HIM.
[ct=2255.912] 55 -- 55 YARDS.
[ct=2257.076] >> Kirk: REALLY GOOD
[ct=2258.558] THERE’S MIMS AGAIN IN
[ct=2263.623] THE BACK FIELD, KIND
[ct=2265.505] OF THAT LOOK.
[ct=2266.940] THAT’S A GREAT ANGLE
[ct=2268.200] THAT ALLOWS MIMES TO
[ct=2269.009] GET OUTSIDE AND PICK
[ct=2270.337] UP ALL THOSE YARDS,
[ct=2272.488] AND EVENTUALLY DERWIN
[ct=2273.822] JAMES PICKS HIM UP,
[ct=2276.288] PLAYS DIFFERENT SPOTS.
[ct=2276.760] YOU SEE HOW HE CAME
[ct=2278.500] UNDERNEATH, MAYBE
[ct=2278.963] UNDERESTIMATED THE
[ct=2280.128] SPEED AND BURST THERE
[ct=2281.060] OF MIMS, BUT MIMS GOT
[ct=2283.667] TO THAT CORNER, AND HE
[ct=2284.063] WAS ABLE TO GET BIG
[ct=2284.314] YARDS DOWN THE
[ct=2286.304] >> Al: TACKLED BY THE
[ct=2289.376] PASS IS THROUGH THE
[ct=2291.989] HANDS.
[ct=2292.384] THAT TIME OF JAVOPT
[ct=2294.233] A.I. WILLIAMS.
[ct=2298.245] 2nd AND GOAL WITH 6:30
[ct=2300.933] MINUTES LEFT IN UNTIL
[ct=2302.625] THE HALF.
[ct=2303.588] >> Kirk: HE PUTS IT
[ct=2304.073] OUT THERE.
[ct=2305.308] ONE THING ABOUT BO
[ct=2307.190] NIX, HE’S GOT SO MUCH
[ct=2309.386] COMPETITIVE ENERGY.
[ct=2309.553] SOMETIMES IT EFFECTS
[ct=2310.381] HOW HE GOES THROUGH
[ct=2311.891] PROGRESSIONS,
[ct=2312.310] STOOSOMETIMES ON A
[ct=2313.139] THROW HE PUTS A LITTLE
[ct=2314.364] TOUCH ON IT.
[ct=2316.926] HE THROWS THAT 90 MILE
[ct=2317.935] AN HOUR FAST BALL, AND
[ct=2318.978] IT GOES THROUGH THE
[ct=2322.154] HANDS OF WILLIAMS.
[ct=2322.330] >> Al: ESTIME IN THE
[ct=2325.593] ALREADY HAS A
[ct=2326.195] TOUCHDOWN TONIGHT.
[ct=2326.576] 2nd AND GOAL.
[ct=2338.610] HE KEEPS, HE THROWS.
[ct=2342.303] VELE, AND THE FLAG IS
[ct=2344.327] >> Kirk: IT’S CHARGERS
[ct=2344.631] OFF SIDES.
[ct=2346.317] THAT’S WHAT IT LOOKED
[ct=2348.018] LIKE TO ME.
[ct=2348.965] THEY WALKED BACK A
[ct=2350.098] DEFENSIVE BACK.
[ct=2351.776] LOOKED LIKE HE WAS
[ct=2352.693] STARTING TO JUMP AT
[ct=2354.652] THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=2355.919] MAYBE A MAN DOWNFIELD.
[ct=2356.922] >> Al: SO THE OFFICIAL
[ct=2359.396] PUT A HAND THE TOP OF
[ct=2361.765] HIS HEAD, WHICH IS
[ct=2363.122] THAT INDICATION.
[ct=2365.752] OFFSETTING.
[ct=2365.752] >> Referee: THERE’S NO
[ct=2366.465] FOUL ON THE PLAY FOR
[ct=2368.385] AN INELIGIBLE MAN
[ct=2369.133] DOWNFIELD AS NUMBER 77
[ct=2370.443] WAS ENGAGED BLOCKING.
[ct=2371.215] RESULT OF THE PLAY IS
[ct=2374.023] A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=2374.023] >> Al: THEY SAY
[ct=2375.803] MEINERZ WAS ENGAGED IN
[ct=2376.720] BLOCKING.
[ct=2379.319] IT WAS MARTIN’S CALL.
[ct=2379.750] AFTER THE FLAG WAS
[ct=2380.928] THROWN.
[ct=2383.483] HE’S DOING TONIGHT ON
[ct=2385.573] MEINERZ RIGHT HERE,
[ct=2386.978] THAT’S A NEW RULE FOR
[ct=2387.221] ME.
[ct=2389.294] I DIDN’T REALIZE, I
[ct=2390.673] MEAN LOOK HOW FAR HE
[ct=2391.267] IS DOWN.
[ct=2393.070] I MEAN HE’S 4, 5 YARDS
[ct=2393.966] DOWNFIELD, BUT HE’S
[ct=2395.172] ENGAGED IN A BLOCK.
[ct=2395.741] TERRY, I’M NOT
[ct=2397.848] FAMILIAR WITH THAT
[ct=2400.210] CALL.
[ct=2401.549] >> Al: THREE DRIVES,
[ct=2402.984] THREE TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=2403.976] WIL LUTZ WITH THE
[ct=2405.792] EXTRA POINT.
[ct=2409.787] AND THE DENVER BRONCOS
[ct=2411.138] >> Al: ALL RIGHT, BACK
[ct=2412.427] TO THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=2414.662] TERRY, COME ON IN HERE
[ct=2415.198] AND TELL US EXACTLY
[ct=2415.516] WHAT YOU SAW IN THIS
[ct=2417.074] >> YEAH, AL.
[ct=2417.563] IT’S LEGAL FOR AN
[ct=2418.712] OFFENSIVE LINEMAN TO
[ct=2420.151] ENGAGE A DEFENSIVE
[ct=2422.320] LINEMAN ON HIS INITIAL
[ct=2422.480] CHARGE AND DRIVE HIM
[ct=2423.594] DOWNFIELD.
[ct=2424.977] BUT HERE 77 CHIPS AND
[ct=2425.698] THEN GOES DOWNFIELD ON
[ct=2427.015] HIS OWN, WELL BEYOND 1
[ct=2427.920] YARD.
[ct=2428.543] THEY SHOULD HAVE LEFT
[ct=2429.442] THE FLAG DOWN FOR AN
[ct=2430.347] INELIGIBLE DOWNFIELD.
[ct=2432.218] THIS IS A FOUL.
[ct=2432.594] >> Al: YEP.
[ct=2433.416] WELL, YOU SAW A
[ct=2435.199] PENALTY MARKER.
[ct=2436.556] YOU SAW THE OFFICIAL
[ct=2436.887] PUT HIS HAND ON THE
[ct=2437.949] TOP OF HIS HEAD, AND
[ct=2438.963] YOU CAN SEE WHERE JIM
[ct=2440.306] HARBAUGH IS THINKING
[ct=2441.445] ABOUT AS THEY GIVE HIM
[ct=2443.980] THE EXPLANATION.
[ct=2445.467] SO THEY GET AWAY WITH
[ct=2446.762] ONE.
[ct=2448.107] THEY HAVE AN 11-POINT
[ct=2450.154] LEAD TO THE BRONCOS.
[ct=2451.307] AND THE CHARGERS WILL
[ct=2453.621] GET IT WITH 6:22
[ct=2457.423] REMAINING IN THE FIRST
[ct=2459.922] WELL, THE CHARGERS --
[ct=2460.688] RIGHT NOW THE
[ct=2461.777] CHARGERS, PHILLY, AND
[ct=2462.894] DENVER GIVING UP THE
[ct=2463.778] FEWEST POINTS IN THE
[ct=2464.146] LEAGUE.
[ct=2466.114] BUT OVER THE LAST FOUR
[ct=2467.947] QUARTERS -- LAST TWO

[ct=2474.118] POINTS.
[ct=2475.487] >> Kirk: YEAH, AND YOU
[ct=2475.925] COULD -- YOU COULD
[ct=2476.572] LOOK AT A NUMBER OF
[ct=2478.562] DIFFERENT THINGS.
[ct=2482.532] ELIJAH MOULTON IS NOT
[ct=2483.879] PLAYING TONIGHT,
[ct=2485.548] GILMAN, CAM HART OUT,
[ct=2489.552] MARCUS MAYE OUT.
[ct=2491.823] KHALIL MACK, BOSA, YOU
[ct=2492.405] DON’T FEEL THEIR PREZ
[ct=2493.456] NSZ OUT ON THE FIELD
[ct=2494.487] AT ALL.
[ct=2495.014] PROBABLY PLAYING
[ct=2498.218] THROUGH INJURIES,
[ct=2501.115] ESPECIALLY BOSA.
[ct=2502.393] >> Al: TACKLE BY D.J.
[ct=2502.961] JONES.
[ct=2504.779] LITTLE EXTRA STUFF
[ct=2507.882] GOING ON WITH HURST
[ct=2508.045] AND ONE OF THE
[ct=2509.151] BRONCOS.
[ct=2511.353] >> Kirk: TRYING TO
[ct=2512.535] MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS.
[ct=2513.165] I THINK THE BIGGEST
[ct=2514.616] THING WE SEE FROM UP
[ct=2515.599] HERE WITH A LOT OF NEW
[ct=2517.534] FACES, JUST WANT TO
[ct=2519.700] SEE MORE ENERGY, MORE,
[ct=2522.347] YOU KNOW, GUYS FLYING
[ct=2522.740] TO THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=2523.653] THERE’S GUS EDWARDS.
[ct=2524.997] >> Al: THAT’S NOT A
[ct=2526.290] GOOD SIGN OBVIOUSLY
[ct=2527.848] WITH DOBBINS HURT.
[ct=2529.435] VIDAL IS GOING TO BE
[ct=2532.022] THE BACK RIGHT NOW.
[ct=2532.223] THEY SEND HIM
[ct=2534.516] HERBERT COMES TO THE
[ct=2535.798] RIGHT SIDE, AND IT’S
[ct=2538.748] CAUGHT BY JOSHUA
[ct=2539.441] PALMER FOR A VERY
[ct=2540.902] SHORT GAIN AND A THIRD
[ct=2542.771] DOWN COMING UP.
[ct=2544.723] >> Kirk: HELPS TO HAVE
[ct=2545.816] EXPERIENCE FOR JUSTIN
[ct=2546.720] HERBERT WHEN YOU GET
[ct=2547.233] INTO A GAME LIKE THIS
[ct=2547.896] AND THE DEFENSE IS
[ct=2549.196] SEARCHING, AND THEY
[ct=2550.911] HAVEN’T COME UP WITH
[ct=2552.013] STOPS AS A DEFENSE.
[ct=2554.183] IT PUTS A LITTLE
[ct=2554.381] PRESSURE ON THAT
[ct=2554.991] QUARTERBACK AND THAT
[ct=2555.697] OFFENSE TO TRY TO KEEP
[ct=2558.227] PACE WITH WHAT BO NIX
[ct=2560.183] AND DENVER IS DOING.
[ct=2560.600] THE TIME YOU CAN
[ct=2561.529] PRESS, YOU CAN FEEL
[ct=2562.138] THAT URGENCY TO HAVE
[ct=2563.059] TO MAKE A PLAY.
[ct=2563.908] HERBERT’S GOING TO
[ct=2565.864] HAVE TO AVOID THAT.
[ct=2569.491] >> Al: 3rd DOWN AND 3.
[ct=2572.034] HERBERT HANGING IN THE
[ct=2572.650] POCKET, FIRES, AND NOT
[ct=2574.396] CAUGHT THAT TIME.
[ct=2575.768] COVERAGE GOOD.
[ct=2576.140] PALMER PASSED A LITTLE
[ct=2578.622] BIT BEHIND HIM.
[ct=2579.015] BRANDON JONES COVERING
[ct=2581.291] ON THE PLAY, AND IT’S
[ct=2582.985] FOURTH DOWN, AND AN
[ct=2584.702] L.A. PUNT FORTHCOMING.
[ct=2585.099] >> Kirk: THAT IS A
[ct=2587.273] TIGHT WINDOW TO GO
[ct=2588.171] BETWEEN SURTAIN IN
[ct=2589.797] YOU’VE GOT TO THROW IT
[ct=2591.321] OVER TOP OF SURTAIN
[ct=2591.962] THIS TIME ZONE, AND
[ct=2593.199] GET IN THERE BEFORE
[ct=2594.775] JONES CAN COME IN AND
[ct=2595.363] SEPARATE PALMER FROM
[ct=2598.261] PUTS IT ON A LINE BUT
[ct=2600.099] JUST BEHIND HIM A BIT.
[ct=2600.610] TOUCH CATCH THERE FOR
[ct=2602.451] PALMER.
[ct=2602.848] >> Al: FIRST
[ct=2603.078] INCOMPLETION FOR
[ct=2607.348] HE’S NOW 8 OUT OF 9.
[ct=2611.360] SKY HIGH PUNT.
[ct=2616.691] FAIR CATCH MADE CALL.
[ct=2617.084] EXACTLY 5 MINUTES LEFT
[ct=2618.217] IN THE OPENING HALF.
[ct=2619.405] IN THE OPENING GAME
[ct=2620.338] LOOK DOWN HOLLYWOOD
[ct=2621.647] BOULEVARD ON THIS
[ct=2624.983] BRONCOS THREE
[ct=2627.801] POSSESSIONS, THREE
[ct=2629.090] TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=2629.698] THEY’VE ALREADY RUN 28
[ct=2633.057] PLAYS FOR 219 YARDS.
[ct=2635.745] RUNNING BACK IS THE
[ct=2636.848] ROOKIE BLAKE WATSON.
[ct=2638.103] JUST CALLED UP, ACTIVE
[ct=2639.756] DUTY.
[ct=2639.756] FAKE TOSS.
[ct=2641.608] NIX ON THE RUN, CHASED
[ct=2642.087] BY BOSA.
[ct=2643.716] PICKS UP THE FIRST
[ct=2645.450] DOWN AND A FEW MORE
[ct=2646.386] YARDS.
[ct=2647.719] SO FOR THE SECOND TIME
[ct=2648.868] TONIGHT NIX TAKES OFF.
[ct=2652.057] HE’S GAINED 15 AND 10
[ct=2655.879] ON THE TWO CARRIES.
[ct=2656.518] >> Kirk: THAT’S A
[ct=2657.496] GREAT CALL AGAIN BY
[ct=2658.748] SEAN PAYTON.
[ct=2660.361] YOU’VE GOT BOSA NOT
[ct=2661.370] 100%, GUTTING IT OUT
[ct=2662.596] SO YOU GO BOOT BACK
[ct=2663.222] THE OTHER WAY.
[ct=2664.202] WHAT A CHALLENGE, HE’S
[ct=2665.399] CHASING AND NOW THE
[ct=2666.372] OTHER DIRECTION.
[ct=2667.313] HE’S HAD A HIP INJURY
[ct=2667.727] MOST OF THE YEAR,
[ct=2668.731] TRYING TO GET THROUGH
[ct=2669.637] AND YOU’VE GOT TO
[ct=2670.687] CATCH UP TO THIS GUY
[ct=2671.772] WHO’S RUNNING AND HE
[ct=2672.197] CAN GO NOW AS A
[ct=2674.277] AND GOOD CALL THERE ON
[ct=2676.409] 1st AND 10.
[ct=2676.409] >> Al: YOU’RE SO
[ct=2677.060] RIGHT, THAT HIP
[ct=2677.490] INJURY.
[ct=2678.698] I MEAN HE DOESN’T LOOK
[ct=2683.475] LIKE HE HAS TOSSED IN
[ct=2684.576] THE PAST.
[ct=2686.093] 1st AND 20.
[ct=2687.416] NIX UNDER PRESSURE AND
[ct=2688.093] THEY FINALLY GET TO
[ct=2689.406] THE CHARGERS HAVE PUT
[ct=2690.750] NO PRESSURE ON
[ct=2691.564] MAYFIELD LAST WEEK FOR
[ct=2692.499] MOST OF THE GAME,
[ct=2693.830] FINALLY GET A SECK AND
[ct=2695.720] BOSA.
[ct=2696.104] >> Kirk: THERE’S BOSA.
[ct=2697.010] WE’RE TALKING ABOUT
[ct=2698.113] LOOKS LIKE HE’S
[ct=2699.098] GUTTING IT.
[ct=2699.703] THIS TIME RIGHT OFF
[ct=2700.088] THE BALL.
[ct=2701.053] LOOK AT THE HANDS.
[ct=2701.821] YOU KNOW, HE’S GOT THE
[ct=2703.109] SIZE AND THE POWER,
[ct=2705.630] BUT HE’S A TECHNICIAN.
[ct=2707.096] GOOD JOB WITH A HAND.
[ct=2707.999] HE GETS OFF A BLOCK
[ct=2708.628] AND JUST CLOSES IN ON
[ct=2709.799] THE POCKET.
[ct=2710.518] THEY HAD APPRECIATION
[ct=2712.082] FOR BO NIX’S ABILITY,
[ct=2713.093] SO THEY WANT TO
[ct=2713.703] SQUEEZE THE POCKET.
[ct=2715.567] YOU SEE THE BLITZ
[ct=2717.039] THERE BY DERWIN JAMES,
[ct=2718.224] SO THEY DIAL-UP THE
[ct=2723.882] GOOD CALL BY
[ct=2725.362] MANIPULATOR AND

[ct=2727.914] TO GET IN THERE.

[ct=2741.337] TALKED ABOUT KHALIL

[ct=2745.680] TONIGHT BUT FOR THIS
[ct=2746.616] TEAM TO MAKE A RUN,
[ct=2748.059] ALPHAS.
[ct=2748.998] THEY NEED THEIR GUYS
[ct=2750.909] TO BE AS EFFECTIVE AND
[ct=2752.684] AS DOMINANT AS THEY
[ct=2753.972] CAN BE AT CRUNCH TIME.
[ct=2754.935] AND YOU CAN SEE, I
[ct=2755.842] MEAN MACK IS A GUY
[ct=2758.094] THAT IN HIS 11th YEAR
[ct=2759.354] STILL HAS THE JUICE,
[ct=2762.065] STILL CAN MAKE PLAYS.
[ct=2763.262] BOSA, AS I INDICATED,
[ct=2763.925] HAS BEEN BATTLING

[ct=3116.704] ENTIRE FIRST HALF, AND
[ct=3119.124] THEY’VE BLITZED HERE A
[ct=3119.497] FEW TIMES WITH THOSE
[ct=3121.610] LINE BACKERS, AND IT’S
[ct=3121.993] OPENED UP THAT SECOND
[ct=3122.603] LEVEL.
[ct=3123.482] AND THEY FOUND
[ct=3124.241] McCONKEY A COUPLE
[ct=3125.805] TIMES.
[ct=3126.617] YEAH, HE LOOKS ABOUT A
[ct=3129.309] HALF YARD SHORT.
[ct=3129.513] >> Al: SO LET’S --
[ct=3130.241] GOING TO MOVE THE
[ct=3131.367] CHAINS BACK.
[ct=3131.977] THE CHAINS HAVE BEEN
[ct=3133.973] MOVED.
[ct=3134.363] SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
[ct=3135.533] A FIRST DOWN, AND NOW
[ct=3136.628] APPARENTLY WITH SOME
[ct=3138.163] REPLAY ASSIST UP TOP,
[ct=3139.493] NO CHALLENGES IN THE
[ct=3143.466] LAST 2 MINUTES.
[ct=3143.846] >> Referee: AFTER
[ct=3145.370] REVIEW, THE RUNNER WAS
[ct=3146.317] SHORT OF THE LINE TO
[ct=3148.507] IT’LL BE 3rd DOWN AT
[ct=3151.589] THAT SPOT.
[ct=3152.709] BY RULE THIS REVERSAL
[ct=3153.394] DOES REQUIRE A
[ct=3154.731] 10-SECOND RUNOFF.
[ct=3155.577] PLEASE SET THE GAME
[ct=3158.758] CLOCK TO 1:25, RUN 10
[ct=3161.108] SECONDS DOWN TO 1:15
[ct=3162.450] AND THE CLOCKS WILL
[ct=3163.823] START ON MY SIGNAL.
[ct=3165.103] 1:15 ON THE GAME CLOCK
[ct=3166.456] PLEASE.
[ct=3166.456] >> Al: ADVANCED
[ct=3169.298] IMPRESSIVE THING IS HE
[ct=3170.412] SAID THAT WITH SOME
[ct=3173.368] >> Al: NO QUESTION.
[ct=3175.913] >> Kirk: WELL, THEY
[ct=3178.419] GOT THE CLOCK RIGHT.
[ct=3178.419] WE’RE READY TO PLAY
[ct=3179.389] BALL HERE.
[ct=3181.179] >> Al: WE THINK.
[ct=3183.229] SO THAT MAKES IT 3rd
[ct=3186.668] DOWN AND INCHES.
[ct=3188.922] >> Kirk: GUS EDWARDS,
[ct=3189.697] BY THE WAY, LIMPED
[ct=3193.458] HE’S BEEN OUT THERE.
[ct=3195.073] >> Al: HERBERT’S GOING
[ct=3197.773] TO KEEP IT HIMSELF,
[ct=3198.803] AND THAT WILL BE A
[ct=3200.987] SO 26 YARD LINE.
[ct=3201.569] CLOCK CONTINUES TO
[ct=3202.834] RUN.
[ct=3203.959] TAKEN IT DOWN TO 60
[ct=3205.168] SECONDS, AND INSIDE A
[ct=3208.310] MINUTE.
[ct=3209.732] >> Kirk: SO IF DENVER
[ct=3210.363] KEEPS BLITZING OR IF
[ct=3211.030] THEY PULL BACK A
[ct=3212.689] LITTLE BIT, VERY GOOD
[ct=3215.157] RED ZONE DEFENSE.
[ct=3216.518] >> Al: 1st AND 10 FROM
[ct=3217.807] THE 26.
[ct=3218.048] HERBERT DANCES IN THE
[ct=3220.249] INTERCEPTED AT THE
[ct=3228.732] GOAL LINE!
[ct=3229.320] KRIS ABRAMS-DRAINE WHO
[ct=3231.873] HAD A GREAT GAME
[ct=3232.510] SUNDAY LAST WEEK OUT
[ct=3233.522] AT INDIANAPOLIS AND
[ct=3235.328] MISSOURI WITH A GIANT
[ct=3236.185] PLAY HERE.
[ct=3237.375] >> Kirk: HE’S PLAYING
[ct=3238.431] OFF COVERAGE AND HOW
[ct=3239.060] GREAT IS THAT?
[ct=3239.751] WE TALKED ABOUT THE
[ct=3241.217] ROOKIE ON THE OTHER
[ct=3242.592] SIDE FOR THE BRONCOS,
[ct=3242.592] BO NIX.
[ct=3243.678] BUT HOW GREAT IS IT TO
[ct=3244.309] BE ABLE TO SEE A
[ct=3245.973] ROOKIE WITH YOUR
[ct=3248.190] STARTING CORNER RILEY
[ct=3248.190] MOSS DOWN, YOU’VE GOT
[ct=3249.403] TO TURN TO A ROOKIE.
[ct=3251.121] AND WATCH HIS EYES
[ct=3252.612] PLAY IN ZONE THE WHOLE
[ct=3253.738] TIME, READING THE
[ct=3254.603] QUARTERBACK, AND
[ct=3255.368] THAT’S WHAT ALLOWS HIM
[ct=3256.501] TO GET A JUMP ON THAT
[ct=3259.519] HE HAD POSITIONED
[ct=3260.555] HIMSELF PERFECTLY, SEE
[ct=3262.604] THE FUMBLE, BUT HE HAS
[ct=3266.665] PLENTY OF TIME TO GET
[ct=3267.154] THE GRIP ON THE BALL.
[ct=3270.241] PUTS IT ON THE MONEY,
[ct=3270.775] BUT THAT’S ALL ON
[ct=3272.265] ABRAMS-DRAINE.
[ct=3272.623] READING THE
[ct=3273.042] QUARTERBACK, PUTTING
[ct=3275.739] HIS BODY IN
[ct=3278.356] COMES UP WITH A PICK.
[ct=3278.975] HE’S GETTING MORE AND
[ct=3279.875] MORE CONFIDENT EVERY
[ct=3280.753] SINGLE WEEK HE GETS A
[ct=3283.064] CHANCE TO BE OUT
[ct=3285.268] >> Al: MADE HIS FIRST
[ct=3285.632] START LAST WEEK.
[ct=3286.470] AND THAT’S A KILLER
[ct=3287.929] FOR THE CHARGERS RIGHT
[ct=3290.113] NOW BECAUSE IT’S GOING
[ct=3290.489] TO BE 11 POINTS OR
[ct=3292.616] MORE AT THE HALF IF
[ct=3293.886] DENVER CAN DO
[ct=3294.470] SOMETHING AND THE
[ct=3295.611] BRONCOS ARE GOING TO
[ct=3299.163] NIX THROWS UNDERNEATH,
[ct=3301.164] LOOKING FOR ROOM.
[ct=3302.288] THERE IS NONE.
[ct=3303.298] TACKLED TO THE 15 YARD
[ct=3305.235] CATCH MADE THERE BY
[ct=3307.897] JAVONTE WILLIAMS.
[ct=3308.992] >> Kirk: YEAH, BRAG ON
[ct=3309.836] HIM ABOUT HOW HE
[ct=3310.753] DOESN’T TURN THE BALL
[ct=3311.361] OVER.
[ct=3312.113] YOU MENTIONED IT EARLY
[ct=3314.236] IN THE BROADCAST.
[ct=3316.231] WHAT, IT WAS WEEK 2
[ct=3316.827] HIS FIRST PICK OF THE
[ct=3317.283] YEAR?
[ct=3318.319] AND THEN LAST WEEK HE
[ct=3319.740] THREW HIS SECOND, AND
[ct=3321.541] NOW TONIGHT A BIG ONE.
[ct=3322.226] >> Al: AND DENVER
[ct=3323.900] PRETTY CONTENT TO LET
[ct=3324.964] THAT CLOCK RUN ALL THE
[ct=3325.595] WAY DOWN.
[ct=3326.369] A COUPLE OF SHORT
[ct=3327.044] THROWS HERE.
[ct=3328.271] WILLIAMS THE INTENDED
[ct=3330.213] RECEIVER, 13 SECONDS.
[ct=3331.870] 3rd DOWN AND 13.
[ct=3355.018] SO NIX IN THE HALF.
[ct=3357.303] 15 OF 21.
[ct=3357.995] 155 YARDS THROWN FOR A
[ct=3359.378] COUPLE OF TOUCHDOWNS
[ct=3360.146] UNLESS SOMEONE TAKES A
[ct=3364.723] THAT’S GOING TO TAKE
[ct=3365.994] US TO --
[ct=3365.994] >> Kirk: JIM HARBAUGH
[ct=3368.705] IS GOING TO CALL A
[ct=3368.705] TIMEOUT BECAUSE OF
[ct=3369.523] THAT INCOMPLETION.
[ct=3373.011] HE MOVED DOWN JUST IN
[ct=3374.342] CASE THEY DID.
[ct=3375.136] LITTLE BIT SURPRISE.
[ct=3376.161] FELT DENVER WAS TRYING
[ct=3376.976] TO WORK THE CLOCK WITH
[ct=3379.814] A COUPLE EASY PASSES.
[ct=3381.180] FIGURED WHY NOT, MAYBE
[ct=3382.402] WE’LL BLOCK A KICK,
[ct=3383.196] MAYBE WE’LL GET A RUN
[ct=3384.549] >> Kirk: YEAH, HE’S
[ct=3385.399] RIGHT THERE READY TO
[ct=3386.441] GO.
[ct=3388.062] HE SEES THE RUN, ALL
[ct=3389.546] RIGHT, GIVE ME THAT
[ct=3391.584] >> Al: HEY, CRAZIER
[ct=3393.585] THINGS HAVE HAPPENED.
[ct=3395.013] >> Kirk: NO DOUBT.
[ct=3395.737] >> Al: SO YOU’VE GOT
[ct=3400.087] DIXON IN FOR THE PUNT.
[ct=3400.865] DERIUS DAVIS, WHO’S
[ct=3403.513] DANGEROUS, IS BACK.
[ct=3404.520] CHARGERS TRY TO SETUP
[ct=3406.259] A RETURN.
[ct=3406.259] FAIR CATCH IS CALLED
[ct=3407.710] FOR.
[ct=3409.221] HE GOES DOWN, BALL IS
[ct=3410.396] LOOSE.
[ct=3411.759] WHATEVER HAPPENS HERE
[ct=3413.644] WITH THE FLAG DOWN,
[ct=3414.774] THE CLOCK GOES TO
[ct=3415.628] TRIPLE ZEROS.
[ct=3426.403] AND THE BRONCOS
[ct=3427.738] THINK --
[ct=3427.907] >> Kirk: THEY SHOULD
[ct=3430.409] GET AN UNTIMED DOWN
[ct=3432.270] THE GUNNER RAN INTO
[ct=3434.389] THE RETURNER.
[ct=3439.727] >> Al: AND IF SO --
[ct=3440.836] WE’LL HEAR MARTIN’S
[ct=3443.006] CALL HERE IN A SECOND.
[ct=3445.147] GIVE IT TO DENVER AN
[ct=3446.694] UNTIMED DOWN, YOU GET
[ct=3448.978] A CHANCE AT A FIELD
[ct=3449.379] GOAL.
[ct=3450.361] >> Kirk: YEAH, I MEAN,
[ct=3451.809] 15 YARDS HERE.
[ct=3452.628] >> Al: TERRY, WHAT ARE
[ct=3453.545] YOU SEEING HERE?
[ct=3454.314] >> IT IS FAIR CATCH
[ct=3455.046] INTERFERENCE, AND IT’S
[ct=3457.083] A 15-YARD PENIMENT.
[ct=3457.877] WE’LL GET AN UNTIMED
[ct=3459.028] DOWN, AND L.A. WILL
[ct=3460.252] HAVE TWO OPTIONS.
[ct=3460.671] THEY CAN EITHER SNAP
[ct=3461.553] THE BALL OR THEY CAN
[ct=3463.914] DO A FREE KICK FOR A
[ct=3464.494] FIELD GOAL, WHICH WE
[ct=3467.920] HAVEN’T SEEN IN
[ct=3467.920] FOREVER.
[ct=3469.195] >> Kirk: WE JUST SAID
[ct=3470.550] CRAZY THINGS ARE GOING
[ct=3471.743] TO HAPPEN HERE.
[ct=3478.522] >> Al: AND YOU’RE
[ct=3480.034] RIGHT, WE HAVEN’T SEEN
[ct=3482.479] THAT FREE KICK IN
[ct=3482.479] YEARS.
[ct=3485.902] SO ARE THEY GOING TO
[ct=3488.132] MOVE THE BALL, THEY’RE
[ct=3488.563] ON THE MARCH RIGHT
[ct=3491.094] >> Kirk: HERBERT LOOKS
[ct=3493.098] LIKE HE’S GOING OUT
[ct=3497.103] >> Al: PENALTY WAS ON
[ct=3499.345] TRE’MON SMITH.
[ct=3499.816] THE BALL IS GOING TO
[ct=3502.640] BE SPOTTED AT THE 47.
[ct=3502.640] YOU’LL BE LOOKING AT
[ct=3504.003] IT, IF YOU WANTED TO
[ct=3505.702] KICK A FIELD GOAL, IT
[ct=3506.798] WOULD HAVE TO BE 65
[ct=3508.211] >> Kirk: YEAH.
[ct=3508.818] THE OFFENSE IS OUT
[ct=3509.742] THERE, AND YOU THINK
[ct=3516.114] OF YOUR --
[ct=3517.953] >> Referee: OUT BY THE
[ct=3522.705] 30 SECONDS.
[ct=3522.924] >> Al: SO, OF COURSE,
[ct=3524.110] YOU’VE GOT THE PICKET
[ct=3524.700] FENCE BACK THERE FOR
[ct=3525.631] DENVER AT THE GOAL
[ct=3527.248] SO YOUR OPTION IS HAIL
[ct=3530.139] MARY OR A FREE KICK.
[ct=3530.139] TERRY, WHAT ARE YOU
[ct=3532.733] >> YES.
[ct=3532.886] SO IF THEY DO A FAIR
[ct=3533.538] CATCH KICK, THEY’RE
[ct=3534.558] GOING TO KICK FROM
[ct=3535.287] WHERE THE BALL IS
[ct=3537.020] RIGHT NOW, FROM THE 47
[ct=3540.999] TO MAKE IT A 57-YARD
[ct=3543.250] KICK.
[ct=3546.289] AND THEY’LL LINE UP
[ct=3546.289] JUST AS THEY WOULD ON
[ct=3546.713] A FREE KICK.
[ct=3547.713] CAN’T BE BLOCKED, BUT
[ct=3548.603] THEY CAN CERTAINLY
[ct=3549.275] KICK FROM WHERE IT IS
[ct=3550.538] RIGHT NOW.
[ct=3551.921] >> Kirk: YOU THINK JIM
[ct=3553.628] HARBAUGH KNOWS THAT?
[ct=3554.524] SOMEBODY BETTER TAP
[ct=3555.898] HIM ON HIS SHOULDER.
[ct=3556.242] I THINK HE’S GETTING
[ct=3557.368] THAT EXPLANATION RIGHT
[ct=3559.064] YOU JUST DON’T SEE
[ct=3560.169] THIS HAPPEN, LIKE YOU
[ct=3561.649] SAID, VERY OFTEN.
[ct=3562.394] >> Al: NO.
[ct=3564.419] >> Kirk: I WAS WITH
[ct=3566.725] YOU, I’D ASSUME THE
[ct=3568.622] BALL RIGHT THERE.
[ct=3568.779] >> Al: I’VE OMSEEN ONE
[ct=3571.249] RIGHT THERE.
[ct=3571.403] >> Kirk: GOOD CALL,
[ct=3573.906] TERRY.
[ct=3575.228] >> Al: DICKER, THIS
[ct=3576.034] WITH WITHIN HIS
[ct=3577.538] HIS LONG IS 59.
[ct=3579.642] ESPECIALLY ON A FREE
[ct=3582.131] KICK SITUATION.
[ct=3583.436] >> Kirk: NOW, IT CAN
[ct=3583.865] BE RETURNED.
[ct=3585.091] AND IF THE BALL’S LIVE
[ct=3586.328] ONCE IT GOES UP IN THE
[ct=3587.830] AIR.
[ct=3589.120] >> Al: THE LAST TIME
[ct=3589.523] ONE OF THESE WAS
[ct=3594.465] SUCCESSFUL WAS 1976.
[ct=3595.235] >> Kirk: IT WAS YOUR
[ct=3596.272] FIRST YEAR ON MONDAY
[ct=3597.172] NIGHT FOOTBALL, WASN’T
[ct=3598.682] IT?
[ct=3601.170] >> Al: 1986.
[ct=3601.742] COME ON.
[ct=3602.615] YOU’RE MAKING ME OLDER
[ct=3603.204] THAN I AM.
[ct=3604.358] I SAW THE GAME ON
[ct=3604.992] TELEVISION.
[ct=3605.756] YOU DID, TOO, FROM
[ct=3608.840] YOUR BASSINET.
[ct=3610.829] BRONCOS HAVE NOW
[ct=3612.746] CALLED A TIMEOUT.
[ct=3615.403] >> Kirk: THIS IS COOL.
[ct=3615.794] LOOK AT THIS.
[ct=3618.067] YOU’RE RIGHT.
[ct=3629.995] >> Al: SO IN 1976 RAY
[ct=3629.995] WERSHING WAS KICKING
[ct=3631.495] FOR ALL OF TEAMS THE
[ct=3633.036] CHARGERS AND IT WAS
[ct=3635.320] AGAINST BUFFALO AND IT
[ct=3637.974] ENDED THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=3638.190] >> Kirk: HERE WE GO
[ct=3639.104] AGAIN.
[ct=3639.456] >> Al: RIGHT.
[ct=3640.925] EVERY HALF A CENTURY
[ct=3641.531] THIS COMES INTO PLAY.
[ct=3642.326] >> Kirk: I MEAN AS
[ct=3643.847] MUCH AS THESE COACHES
[ct=3645.831] DO PREP IN OTAs, IN
[ct=3647.984] CAMP, HOW MANY COACHES
[ct=3649.119] PRACTICE THIS?
[ct=3650.129] I MEAN HOW OFTEN DOES
[ct=3651.520] THIS EVEN COME UP IN
[ct=3653.440] CONVERSATION?
[ct=3653.996] >> Al: EVERY 50 YEARS
[ct=3654.623] YOU PRACTICE THIS
[ct=3655.278] THING.
[ct=3656.090] >> Kirk: WATCH HIM PUT
[ct=3658.738] THIS THROUGH.
[ct=3660.087] THIS WOULD BE A BIG --
[ct=3662.712] >> Al: HE’S 8 OF 9.
[ct=3663.444] >> Kirk: LET’S GO PUT
[ct=3665.425] IT THROUGH.
[ct=3666.713] >> Al: SO J.K. SCOTT’S
[ct=3666.914] GOING TO HOLD IT.
[ct=3668.050] AND THIS WOULD MAKE IT
[ct=3670.219] 21-13 AT THE HALF IF
[ct=3670.888] IT’S GOOD.
[ct=3673.370] >> Kirk: I MEAN, HE
[ct=3673.534] TAKES ALL THE TIME IN
[ct=3674.141] THE WORLD.
[ct=3678.688] THIS IS LIKE WARMUPS.
[ct=3679.988] >> Al: MEANWHILE,
[ct=3680.351] MARVIN MIMS IS ALL THE
[ct=3681.940] WAY BACK IN CASE IT’S
[ct=3683.670] SHORT AND HE WANTS TO
[ct=3684.335] RUN IT BACK.
[ct=3689.557] SO DICKER, THREE YEARS
[ct=3691.049] NOW SOLVING CHARGER
[ct=3695.238] KICKING WOES FOR SEVEN
[ct=3696.233] YEARS PRIOR TO THAT.
[ct=3697.499] CAN HE BANG IT
[ct=3697.677] THROUGH?
[ct=3699.775] ON ITS WAY.
[ct=3701.686] IT IS -- YEP!
[ct=3702.710] >> Kirk: MADE HISTORY
[ct=3705.605] >> Al: YES.
[ct=3708.626] >> Kirk: THERE YOU GO.
[ct=3708.780] >> Al: TERRY, GREAT
[ct=3715.232] PICK UP 3.
[ct=3715.836] SEAN PAYTON GOING WHAT
[ct=3719.216] DID I DO.
[ct=3723.191] AND IT’S 21-13.
[ct=3723.558] TRE’MON SMITH WAS THE
[ct=3724.418] GUY WITH THE FAIR
[ct=3725.918] CATCH INTERFERENCE
[ct=3729.712] SETTING THIS BABY UP.
[ct=3731.871] AND IT’S AN 8-POINT
[ct=3734.137] HALFTIME LEAD FOR THE
[ct=3736.724] KAYLEE?
[ct=3739.374] >> SEAN, WHAT WERE YOU
[ct=3740.871] THINKING AS THAT LAST
[ct=3741.305] PLAY UNFOLDED?
[ct=3743.355] >> WELL, IT’S A FAIR
[ct=3743.719] CATCH FREE KICK
[ct=3744.858] SITUATION.
[ct=3745.251] WE PRACTICE IT.
[ct=3747.195] HE’S GOT THE LEG, AND
[ct=3747.784] I THINK, LOOK, THE
[ct=3750.194] PENALTY PUT HIM IN
[ct=3750.329] RANGE.
[ct=3751.502] >> YOUR OFFENSE, HOW
[ct=3752.089] DO YOU EXPLAIN WHAT’S
[ct=3753.643] ALLOWED IT TO BE SO
[ct=3754.087] PRODUCT INTENSIVE.
[ct=3755.989] >> WELL, WE’VE HAD
[ct=3756.606] PRETTY GOOD BAL
[ct=3757.103] BALANCE.
[ct=3758.583] OUR THIRD DOWN NUMBERS
[ct=3758.583] ARE GOOD.
[ct=3760.022] WE STALLED ON THAT
[ct=3761.117] LAST DRIVE.
[ct=3762.804] I THINK IT’S IMPORTANT
[ct=3764.164] WE’RE READY TO RUN THE
[ct=3765.689] >> THANKS, COACH.
[ct=3768.109] WE CAN SEE IT ON YOUR
[ct=3768.109] PLAY SHEET.
[ct=3769.452] YOU’VE REMINDING
[ct=3769.620] YOURSELF.
[ct=3770.257] >> Kirk: THEY DO
[ct=3771.175] PRACTICE IT.
[ct=3776.864] >> Al: I GUESS.
[ct=3777.055] 21-13.
[ct=3778.912] COMING UP AFTER THE
[ct=3778.912] BREAK THE STATE FAR BO NIX IS
[ct=3780.228] THROWING THE BALL WELL
[ct=3780.825] ESPECIALLY ON THE
[ct=3781.242] MOVE.
[ct=3781.887] BUT I WOULD NOT BE
[ct=3783.319] SURPRISED IF THEY GO
[ct=3784.307] BACK IN A SECOND HALF
[ct=3786.166] TO RELYING ON THAT --
[ct=3787.107] THAT OFFENSIVE LINE
[ct=3788.339] AND THE ROTATION OF
[ct=3790.460] THE RUNNING BACKS
[ct=3791.199] WHERE THEY WERE REALLY
[ct=3792.744] DOMINATING THE LINE OF
[ct=3802.756] >> Al: TOUCH BACK.
[ct=3803.584] DENVER STARTS AT THE
[ct=3805.417] >> Kirk: LET’S TAKE A
[ct=3808.066] LOOK AT OUR STATS
[ct=3812.590] POWERED BY AWS.
[ct=3814.319] HE LEADS THE NFL IN
[ct=3815.616] COMPLETIONS IN YARDS
[ct=3816.709] THROWING ON THE RUN
[ct=3820.250] HE’S 5 OF 6 ON THE
[ct=3822.199] RUN, 6-7 ON THE TWO
[ct=3824.481] THE SMILE ON THE
[ct=3827.113] SAYS IT ALL.
[ct=3828.010] JUST FEELING GOOD,
[ct=3829.282] KIND OF IN THAT ZONE.
[ct=3830.445] LET’S SEE IF HE CAN
[ct=3831.851] KEEP THAT GOING HERE
[ct=3832.812] AGAINST THE CHARGERS
[ct=3835.005] ON THE OTHER HAND, THE
[ct=3836.389] CHARGERS ARE TRYING TO
[ct=3837.571] FIND A SPARK TO GET
[ct=3839.154] THEIR DAUBERS UP,
[ct=3840.490] START FLYING AROUND A
[ct=3842.680] BIT MORE.
[ct=3843.412] >> Al: START FLYING ON
[ct=3845.175] THE GROUND.
[ct=3845.562] ONE THINK ABOUT NIX
[ct=3846.672] WITH ESMAY PICKING UP
[ct=3848.193] 7, BODY LANGUAGE.
[ct=3849.020] SOMETIMES WE MAKE TOO
[ct=3850.838] MUCH OF IT, BUT YOU
[ct=3852.377] SEE NIX AND HE LOOKS
[ct=3855.053] LIKE A GUY IN HIS
[ct=3855.053] EIGHTH YEAR WHO’S BEEN
[ct=3856.637] TO THE SUPER BOWL ONCE
[ct=3857.299] OR TWICE.
[ct=3858.423] HE JUST HAS THAT LOOK
[ct=3859.836] ABOUT HIM.
[ct=3860.770] >> Kirk: I STILL GO
[ct=3862.258] BACK TO THAT POSITION
[ct=3863.924] AS MANY OF THESE
[ct=3864.879] COLLEGE QUARTERBACKS
[ct=3866.106] THE LAST 30 YEARS,
[ct=3866.571] THEY’RE ALL IN A
[ct=3869.268] SPRINT TO LEAVE
[ct=3870.780] COLLEGE AND GET TO THE
[ct=3871.092] NFL.
[ct=3871.941] AND YET HERE’S A GUY
[ct=3873.806] WHO PLAYED 61 -- HE
[ct=3874.799] HAD 61 STARTS IN FIVE
[ct=3876.089] AND I THINK THAT
[ct=3876.942] EXPERIENCE ALLOWS HIM
[ct=3878.126] TO PLAY THE WAY HE IS
[ct=3879.763] IN THE NFL.
[ct=3881.879] >> Al: STOPPED A YARD
[ct=3883.405] SHY.
[ct=3884.589] WELL, WITH NIL,
[ct=3884.589] THEY’RE NOT IN THAT
[ct=3886.043] MUCH OF A SPRINT
[ct=3888.806] ANYMORE.
[ct=3890.106] >> Kirk: A DISASTER.
[ct=3890.928] WHY DON’T WE JOIN THE
[ct=3891.965] STUDIO TEAM AND DO A
[ct=3892.609] POST GAME?
[ct=3893.403] WE CAN DO A COUPLE OF
[ct=3894.560] HOURS ON THAT.
[ct=3895.740] ALTHOUGH WE’VE GOT MR.
[ct=3897.040] BEAST AFTER.
[ct=3897.040] >> Al: THE WHOLE
[ct=3898.505] >> Kirk: YEAH, WE
[ct=3899.950] CAN’T DO THAT.
[ct=3900.601] WELL, OPPORTUNITY HERE
[ct=3902.583] FOR THE CHARGERS.
[ct=3904.014] BIG STOP THERE ON
[ct=3904.372] SECOND DOWN.
[ct=3905.439] THEY’VE GOT A SHOT
[ct=3908.683] HERE ON 3rd DOWN AND
[ct=3908.885] SHORT.
[ct=3910.990] >> Al: BALL UP AT THE
[ct=3912.278] 39 YARD LINE.
[ct=3914.322] 3rd AND A LONG YARD.
[ct=3915.468] MIMS IS IN THE
[ct=3921.797] NIX, CLEAN POCKET.
[ct=3922.397] THROWS A STRIKE AND
[ct=3925.780] ALL THE WAY TO THE 42
[ct=3927.564] YARD LINE GOES TROY
[ct=3931.102] FRANKLIN.
[ct=3932.441] SO THE OREGONIANS
[ct=3933.333] PLAYED WITH THE DUCKS.
[ct=3939.091] >> Kirk: TROYE, 85,
[ct=3940.169] CLEARS IT UP.
[ct=3942.223] AND NICE OPENING LINE
[ct=3947.392] THAT’S THE ROOKIE
[ct=3948.519] COLSON OUT
[ct=3951.141] NIX SURVEYING, TIMING
[ct=3952.521] AND RHYTHM, AGAIN ON
[ct=3952.954] POINT.
[ct=3955.312] AND THERE’S THAT SMILE
[ct=3957.287] >> Al: HE IS HAVING
[ct=3959.307] FUN.
[ct=3959.307] MIMS AGAIN IN THE
[ct=3962.183] TOSS, DROPS IT, PICKS
[ct=3962.810] IT UP.
[ct=3964.064] IT’S DRAKEN DOWN JUST
[ct=3964.830] ABOUT AT THE LINE OF
[ct=3966.994] IT’LL BE SECOND DOWN.
[ct=3969.154] JUST.
[ct=3969.581] EVEN THOUGH HE’S BEEN
[ct=3971.124] BACK THERE A HANDFUL
[ct=3972.608] OF TIMES THE LAST
[ct=3973.675] THREE OR FOUR WEEKS
[ct=3974.496] THAT’S JUST A GUY
[ct=3975.135] EXCITED TO MAKE A
[ct=3976.668] PLAY, TOOK HIS EYE OFF
[ct=3977.609] THE FOOTBALL, STARTED
[ct=3978.514] TO LOOK WHERE HE WAS
[ct=3979.323] GOING TO GO BEFORE
[ct=3980.303] HE -- BEFORE HE
[ct=3981.133] BROUGHT IT IN.
[ct=3982.327] THEY’VE BEEN PRETTY
[ct=3983.438] FLAWLESS FOR MOST OF
[ct=3984.384] THEIR EXECUTION.
[ct=3984.847] LOOK AT THE HEAD RIGHT
[ct=3986.684] HE JUST ASSUMED HE
[ct=3987.093] WOULD BE ABLE TO
[ct=3989.356] HANDLE THAT BALL.
[ct=3990.192] AND NORMALLY HE WAS.
[ct=3991.652] HE HAS GREAT HANDS,
[ct=3992.842] BUT JUST GOT AWAY FROM
[ct=4000.028] >> Al: ON 2nd AND 12.
[ct=4005.381] FLEAFLICKER, MIMS,
[ct=4006.358] BACK TO NIX.
[ct=4008.449] CAUGHT AT THE 41 YARD
[ct=4010.801] LINE IT’S TRAUTMAN.
[ct=4012.187] ADAM TRAUTMAN PLAYED
[ct=4015.038] WITH SEAN PAYTON FOR
[ct=4016.387] HIM AT NEW ORLEANS.
[ct=4017.472] SHORT GAIN THERE.
[ct=4019.178] >> Kirk: GOOD JOB BY
[ct=4019.681] TONY JEFFERSON AND
[ct=4021.722] DERWIN JAMES.
[ct=4022.188] REMEMBER, THESE GUYS,
[ct=4022.987] JAMES HAS PLAYED A LOT
[ct=4023.489] OF FOOTBALL.
[ct=4024.589] BUT THIS IS JUST
[ct=4026.287] TESTING THE DISCIPLINE
[ct=4027.574] OF THOSE SAFETIES.
[ct=4028.897] THEY TAKE AWAY A LOT
[ct=4030.326] OF SHOTS DOWNFIELD, SO
[ct=4031.386] NIX’S ONLY CHOICE IS
[ct=4033.552] TO CHECK IT COUNSEL.
[ct=4034.071] GOOD JOB AGAIN.
[ct=4034.962] TONY JEFFERSON WAS IN
[ct=4035.858] THE SCOUTING
[ct=4036.299] DEPARTMENT LAST YEAR,
[ct=4037.494] RETIRED FROM FOOTBALL.
[ct=4039.188] AND CAME BACK THIS
[ct=4040.233] YEAR AND WITH THE
[ct=4041.023] INJURIES HE’S OUT
[ct=4043.295] THERE PLAYING.
[ct=4044.641] >> Al: TENTH SEASON IN
[ct=4044.988] THE NFL.
[ct=4047.290] 3rd DOWN AND 7.
[ct=4047.922] EXTRA PRESSURE, PASS
[ct=4049.076] IS CAUGHT, BUT HE
[ct=4050.128] CANNOT PICK UP THE
[ct=4053.289] SO ADKINS MADE THAT
[ct=4054.760] GRAB.
[ct=4057.691] IT’S 4th DOWN.
[ct=4058.483] MAKING THE TACKLE
[ct=4060.812] IT’LL BE 4th AND 2.
[ct=4062.219] >> Kirk: SEE THE SEAN
[ct=4063.031] PAYTON DECIDES TO GET
[ct=4064.662] AGGRESSIVE, KIND OF IN
[ct=4065.608] THAT AREA WHERE A LOT
[ct=4066.631] OF TIMES YOU’LL SEE
[ct=4068.359] COACHES WITH THE
[ct=4071.277] ANALYTICS AT IT THAT
[ct=4072.544] 35, 40 YARD LINE.
[ct=4073.215] ESPECIALLY THE
[ct=4073.838] CONFIDENCE THEY HAVE
[ct=4074.444] RIGHT NOW IN THEIR
[ct=4075.307] SCHEME, HE IS GOING TO
[ct=4077.616] GO FOR IT.
[ct=4077.616] >> Al: AT LEAST LINE
[ct=4077.984] UP TO.
[ct=4081.603] IT WOULD BE A 53-YARD
[ct=4083.669] FIELD GOAL ATTEMPT.
[ct=4085.606] DO THEY GO?
[ct=4088.201] THREE RECEIVERS SET TO
[ct=4088.660] THE RIGHT.
[ct=4091.465] PLAY CLOCK AT 2.
[ct=4093.540] PASS IS CAUGHT, AND
[ct=4095.723] TO THE 30 YARD LINE
[ct=4099.362] GOES COURTLAND SUTTON.
[ct=4101.072] >> Kirk: HE KNEW
[ct=4102.592] WANTED TO GO WITH THAT
[ct=4104.956] HE MOTIONS 45, ADKINS,
[ct=4106.766] IN THERE TO GIVE HIM
[ct=4107.762] THAT EXTRA BLOCKER,
[ct=4108.555] AND THERE HE IS
[ct=4109.542] ALREADY IN POSITION.
[ct=4111.941] NOW YOU JUST GET
[ct=4111.941] BEHIND IT.
[ct=4112.686] I LOVE THAT HE DIDN’T
[ct=4113.590] HESITATE.
[ct=4114.237] HE GOT RID OF THAT
[ct=4115.305] FOOTBALL IN A HURRY,
[ct=4116.173] KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE
[ct=4116.907] WANTED.
[ct=4117.631] QUICKLY GOT THE BALL
[ct=4118.550] OUT THERE, AND PRETTY
[ct=4120.617] EASY FOR COURTLAND
[ct=4122.183] SUTTON WITH THE
[ct=4122.382] ADVANTAGE THEY HAD
[ct=4124.307] WITH THE BIG FULLBACK
[ct=4125.512] AND THE TIGHT END OUT
[ct=4126.716] IN FRONT.
[ct=4127.436] >> Al: GREAT DESIGN ON
[ct=4128.676] A 4th AND 2.
[ct=4131.303] BURTON THE FALL BACK,
[ct=4134.958] ESTIME BEHIND THE LINE
[ct=4141.637] THERE TART MAKES A
[ct=4144.293] TACKLE THERE.
[ct=4146.230] PICK UP AT 90.
[ct=4146.629] >> Kirk: THERE’S OUR
[ct=4148.422] DEFENSIVE ALERT.
[ct=4149.164] ANY TIME YOU SEE JAMES
[ct=4149.855] COME AROUND THE LINE
[ct=4150.886] OF SCRIMMAGE,
[ct=4152.965] THIS A GUY THAT COULD
[ct=4154.139] BE COMING.
[ct=4154.731] IN THIS CASE HE DID
[ct=4155.862] COME, AND LOOK AT THE
[ct=4157.451] ATHLETIC ABILITY OF
[ct=4160.295] HE IS SO GOOD.
[ct=4163.574] THAT’S WHERE HE MAKES
[ct=4165.461] AN IMPACT OCHBN THE GAME.
[ct=4166.299] THAT TIME THEY WALKED
[ct=4167.509] HIM UP AND ON FIRST
[ct=4171.874] DOWN HE MAKES A
[ct=4178.439] DIFFERENCE.
[ct=4178.608] >> Al: SUTTON ONE
[ct=4179.978] NIX DANCING, NIX
[ct=4180.689] THROWING, AND
[ct=4183.384] MIMS WAS DOWN THERE,
[ct=4186.254] BUT THE COVERAGE WAS
[ct=4190.544] TARHEEB STILL COVERING
[ct=4192.658] ON THE PLAY.
[ct=4195.114] STILL 3rd AND 11 NOW.
[ct=4196.370] >> Kirk: IF YOU
[ct=4197.011] HAVEN’T NOTICED END OF
[ct=4198.762] FIRST HALF AND NOW THE
[ct=4200.468] SECOND HALF THE ANSWER
[ct=4201.350] MIMS HAS COME UP WITH
[ct=4202.450] IS MORE PRESSURE.
[ct=4203.483] HE’S BEEN BLITZING
[ct=4210.284] THAT TIME JUST TAYLOR
[ct=4210.690] THAT CAME ON THE
[ct=4211.127] BLITZ.
[ct=4212.985] TRYING TO GET HIM OUT
[ct=4215.707] OF THIS RHYTHM HE’S
[ct=4215.889] IN.
[ct=4216.915] THERE’S JAMES WALKING
[ct=4217.083] UP AGAIN.
[ct=4218.787] HE’S UP HERE.
[ct=4219.715] >> Al: E. YG THE BACK
[ct=4222.295] FIELD, GOES FIVE WIDE.
[ct=4223.805] HERE’S MIMS, AND MIMS
[ct=4225.390] IS TAKEN DOWN AT THE
[ct=4226.157] 23 YARD LINE.
[ct=4228.353] SO IT’S TONY JEFFERSON
[ct=4228.853] AGAIN MAKING THAT
[ct=4229.953] YOU’VE GOT A 4th DOWN
[ct=4230.615] AND 3.
[ct=4232.349] GOING TO KICK IT THIS
[ct=4233.898] TIME.
[ct=4235.765] >> Al: IN COMES THE
[ct=4236.154] FIELD GOAL GROUP.
[ct=4237.695] >> Kirk: MAYBE GET THE
[ct=4239.507] POINTS BACK THAT THEY
[ct=4240.313] LOST THE END OF THE
[ct=4241.437] FIRST HALF.
[ct=4242.726] REALLY THEIR OWN PLAY
[ct=4243.591] CALLING OPENED UP THAT
[ct=4244.059] OPPORTUNITY FOR THE
[ct=4245.935] CHARGERS READY TO GO
[ct=4247.068] IN AT HALF.
[ct=4248.481] AND THEN WITH THAT
[ct=4249.851] INCOMPLETE PASS, STOP
[ct=4252.985] THE CLOCK AND USE A
[ct=4254.901] >> Al: HARBAUGH CALLED
[ct=4257.165] A TIMEOUT AND SAID WHY
[ct=4259.556] NOT, WHAT DO WE HAVE
[ct=4259.801] TO LOSE?
[ct=4261.164] BLOCK, A RUN BACK,
[ct=4262.497] MAYBE A FREE KICK
[ct=4263.788] EVERY 50 YEARS.
[ct=4264.765] THIS KICK BY LUTZ IS
[ct=4265.600] U DON’T MEET COACHES
[ct=4268.393] AS ENTHUSED ABOUT THE
[ct=4269.619] SPORT AS HARBAUGH
[ct=4272.384] >> Al: YEAH, HE’S USED
[ct=4273.769] TO THESE RECLAMATION
[ct=4275.087] PROJECTS.
[ct=4279.180] REMINDS ME A LOT OF
[ct=4280.660] LARRY BROWN IN
[ct=4281.103] BASKETBALL.
[ct=4281.832] EVERYWHERE LARRY WENT,
[ct=4282.358] HE TURNED IT AROUND.
[ct=4284.521] COLLEGE, PRO.
[ct=4286.396] >> Al: AND THIS ONE IS
[ct=4287.254] A TOUCH BACK.
[ct=4289.668] SO WHAT’S AT STAKE IN
[ct=4292.696] THIS GAME TONIGHT?
[ct=4294.375] IF DENVER WINS,
[ct=4294.779] THEY’RE IN THE
[ct=4296.713] PLAYOFFS.
[ct=4297.160] FIRST PLAYOFF THEY’VE
[ct=4298.369] WON SINCE THE SUPER
[ct=4301.268] BOWL BACK IN ’15 WITH
[ct=4302.182] PEYTON MANNING AND
[ct=4303.340] COMPANY.
[ct=4303.801] CHARGERS WIN THEY
[ct=4304.981] DON’T MATHEMATICALLY
[ct=4306.471] CLENCH BUT 97% CHANCE.
[ct=4307.779] EVEN WITH A LOSS WITH
[ct=4308.878] A TWO-GAME ADVANTAGE
[ct=4310.901] WITH THE TEAMS OUT OF
[ct=4310.901] THE WILD CARD PICTURE
[ct=4312.168] RIGHT NOW, STILL THREE
[ct=4313.700] QUARTERS OF A CHANCE,
[ct=4317.661] 74% TO GET TO
[ct=4320.581] POST-SEASON.
[ct=4321.714] HERBERT THROWS.
[ct=4325.694] SO HERE’S A STORY.
[ct=4328.351] DAN FOUSER’S WATCHING
[ct=4329.187] THE GAME.
[ct=4330.288] WE TALKED ABOUT DAN
[ct=4330.709] BEFORE.
[ct=4333.961] HE CALLS OUR
[ct=4335.310] INFORMATION GURE
[ct=4335.700] INFORMATION GURUIN THE
[ct=4336.940] TRUCK AND SAID THAT
[ct=4340.618] KICK IN ’76 HE HAD TO
[ct=4342.441] CONVINCE TOMMY, THE
[ct=4344.800] COACH IN ’76.
[ct=4346.100] IT WAS LEGAL.
[ct=4348.628] DAN FOUCH, WE ASSUME
[ct=4349.557] DAN IS NOT FIBBING TO
[ct=4351.467] GETS CREDIT FOR IT.
[ct=4353.520] THAT?
[ct=4353.887] WE KEEP TAKING THAT
[ct=4355.191] STORY -- TAKING IT
[ct=4357.853] FORWARD A LITTLE BIT.
[ct=4359.222] >> Al: JUST EMBELLISH
[ct=4360.318] IT LIKE CRAZY.
[ct=4363.209] THERE YOU GO, DAN.
[ct=4367.577] 2nd AND 4.
[ct=4368.685] FROM THE 36.
[ct=4369.977] OFF THE FAKE.
[ct=4370.644] HERBERT DANCING,
[ct=4373.831] LOOK AT HIM GO!
[ct=4377.802] TO THE 45 YARD LINE.
[ct=4378.961] BAD WHEEL AND ALL 20
[ct=4380.892] >> Kirk: BUT WE KNOW
[ct=4382.181] HOW ATHLETIC HE IS
[ct=4383.061] WHEN HE’S HEALTHY.
[ct=4383.394] THIS IS JUST
[ct=4384.518] DETERMINATION AND
[ct=4386.311] TOUGHNESS.
[ct=4386.646] THERE’S NOBODY --
[ct=4388.951] NOBODY OPEN DOWNFIELD.
[ct=4390.903] CHECK DOWN’S NOT
[ct=4391.104] THERE, SO HIS
[ct=4393.157] INSTINCTS TAKE OVER.
[ct=4394.928] CODY BARTON TRYING TO
[ct=4396.014] SWIPE AT THE FOOTBALL,
[ct=4396.789] BUT THIS GUY IS --
[ct=4398.120] HE’S A BIG MAN.
[ct=4399.291] WHEN HE TAKES OFF,
[ct=4401.524] HE’S 6’6", 235 POUNDS
[ct=4405.978] AND CAN GO.
[ct=4406.406] >> Al: CDIT HIM WITH
[ct=4409.415] AN 18-YARD SCAMPER.
[ct=4410.619] NO HOLD THERE FOR
[ct=4412.819] VIDAL AS HE’S TAKEN
[ct=4414.295] DOWN A COUPLE OF YARDS
[ct=4414.660] PAST THE LINE OF
[ct=4418.445] 2nd AND 8.
[ct=4419.502] IT’S ONE THING TO GET
[ct=4420.190] THROUGH THE WEEK OF
[ct=4420.898] PRACTICE AND THE
[ct=4423.168] ANKLE’S NOT FEELING
[ct=4425.397] GOOD, BUT YOU GET OUT
[ct=4426.004] HERE, YOU GET THE
[ct=4427.269] COMPETITIVE JUICES
[ct=4428.550] GOING.
[ct=4432.094] YOU’RE DOWN AT 11,
[ct=4432.664] CLOCK’S TICKING DOWN
[ct=4434.627] YOU’VE GOT TO MAKE A
[ct=4437.791] THIS IS WHY HIS TEAM
[ct=4437.963] RESPECTS HIM SO MUCH
[ct=4439.486] AND WHY JIM HARBAUGH
[ct=4441.865] TALKS SO GLOWLY ABOUT
[ct=4443.568] IT’S NOT JUST HIS
[ct=4447.139] PHYSICAL ABILITY.
[ct=4448.923] >> Al: RUNNING BACK.
[ct=4449.359] McCONKEY INSIDE.
[ct=4449.778] OFF THE FAKE, FIRES
[ct=4450.905] OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=4451.670] CAUGHT AND FINDING HIS
[ct=4452.599] WAY FOR THE FIRST
[ct=4455.086] DOWN, TUCKER FISK, ONE
[ct=4455.973] OF THE THREE TIGHT
[ct=4457.528] ENDS ACTIVE TONIGHT.
[ct=4458.375] SO HE MAKES HIS FIRST
[ct=4461.635] GRAB OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=4462.001] AND HERBERT IS REALLY
[ct=4463.387] SPRINTING AROUND.
[ct=4464.607] THAT’S NINE DIFFERENT
[ct=4465.543] RECEIVERS, NINE.
[ct=4468.583] LINE BACKERS AND THE
[ct=4469.455] SAFETIES.
[ct=4470.389] LOOK HOW THEY JUST
[ct=4470.858] SINK.
[ct=4471.776] THEY’RE TRYING TO TAKE
[ct=4472.940] ANY THREATS AWAY
[ct=4473.498] DOWNFIELD, KIND OF
[ct=4474.840] PUTTING A SHELL ON THE
[ct=4476.921] AND WE’VE SEEN BO NIX
[ct=4478.152] WITH A LOT OF THESE
[ct=4480.277] MOVES.
[ct=4480.484] ZACH ALLEN JUST MAKING
[ct=4481.038] SURE.
[ct=4482.202] JUST A LITTLE FRIENDLY
[ct=4483.118] TAP THERE ON THE
[ct=4483.871] FOLLOW THROUGH.
[ct=4486.950] BUT WE’VE SEEN BO NIX
[ct=4487.127] DO IT.
[ct=4487.456] AND NOW WE’VE SEEN
[ct=4489.098] HERBERT WITH CHECK
[ct=4490.331] DOWNS FOR FIRST DOWN
[ct=4491.866] YARDAGE.
[ct=4492.563] >> Al: VIDAL, HE’S
[ct=4493.666] GOING TO BE TAKEN DOWN
[ct=4499.584] FROM BEHIND
[ct=4501.158] FROM BE BEHIND.
[ct=4501.587] THAT’S ZAC ALLEN
[ct=4501.780] REACHING AROUND,
[ct=4502.394] STOPPING HIM IN HIS
[ct=4502.599] TRACKS.
[ct=4504.037] GUY IS ONE OF THE
[ct=4504.789] UNDERRATED PLAYERS IN
[ct=4507.294] THE ENTIRE NFL.
[ct=4507.513] WATCH THE GET OFF.
[ct=4508.505] WE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE
[ct=4509.954] PLAYED WITH J.J. ALLEN
[ct=4511.300] WHEN THEY WERE WITH
[ct=4511.973] THE CARDINALS
[ct=4512.629] TOGETHER.
[ct=4513.202] HE LEARNED A LOT
[ct=4514.321] I THINK THE ADDITION
[ct=4517.575] OF MALCOLM ROACH, JOHN
[ct=4518.521] FRANKLIN-MYERS HAS
[ct=4519.571] REALLY HELPED HIM WITH
[ct=4520.297] D.J. JONES.
[ct=4522.550] YOU LOOK AT THE YEAR
[ct=4523.227] HE’S HAD.
[ct=4523.883] HE’S SECOND ON
[ct=4525.026] DEFENSIVE TACK LDS
[ct=4527.017] WITH PASS RUSHING BUT
[ct=4527.353] HE’S JUST AS GOOD
[ct=4528.863] AGAINST THE RUN.
[ct=4530.140] >> Al: TAKING MORE
[ct=4532.104] SNAPS, 804, COMING
[ct=4535.504] INTO THE GAME THAN ANY
[ct=4536.991] OTHER IN THE NFL.
[ct=4538.379] TAKING IT TO THE 14.
[ct=4540.972] THEY GO TO STONE
[ct=4546.474] SMARTT, THE TIGHT END.
[ct=4548.265] UNDER 5 TO GO IN THE
[ct=4551.602] THIS AT 15.
[ct=4552.231] >> Kirk: THIS A GREAT
[ct=4553.629] JOB OF IMPROVISING BY
[ct=4556.277] ONCE HE ROLLS OUT, I
[ct=4557.727] THOUGHT HE MIGHT LOOK
[ct=4558.886] TO GET THE BALL TO
[ct=4560.244] McCONKEY.
[ct=4564.072] BUT McKAUPGY
[ct=4566.524] BUT McKACONKEY TAKES A
[ct=4567.309] COUPLE OF DEFENDERS
[ct=4567.983] WITH HIM AND OPENS IT
[ct=4570.961] UP TO SMARTT.
[ct=4572.488] >> Al: GOOD CHOICE OF
[ct=4573.991] WORDS FROM SMARTLY TO
[ct=4574.460] SMARTT.
[ct=4575.441] LOOK OUT, HERBERT,
[ct=4576.863] DOWN HE GOES.
[ct=4580.352] BIG SACK.
[ct=4585.669] TILLMAN RIGHT THERE.
[ct=4587.099] TILLMAN WITH A SACK.
[ct=4588.934] 2nd AND 20.
[ct=4592.041] IS WHAT HE LOVES ABOUT
[ct=4592.947] THE PRESSURE, THE
[ct=4594.187] DEPTH THAT HE HAS.
[ct=4595.356] THAT’S THE FOURTH SACK
[ct=4596.590] THIS YEAR BY BIG
[ct=4597.872] NUMBER 92.
[ct=4600.537] BONITTO AND COOPER AND
[ct=4602.200] ELLISS GET A LOT OF
[ct=4603.291] ATTENTION.
[ct=4604.712] BUT HE’S GOT FOUR GUYS
[ct=4605.946] WHO CAN PRESSURE THE
[ct=4606.367] QUARTERBACKS.
[ct=4608.042] >> Al: THEY LEAD THE
[ct=4609.233] LEAGUE IN SACKS.
[ct=4610.315] HERBERT THROWS,
[ct=4611.098] CAUGHT, SPINNING,
[ct=4614.298] AND YOU’VE GOT FIVE
[ct=4614.627] WHITE SHIRTS TAKING
[ct=4616.065] CARE OF McCONKEY AT
[ct=4617.347] THAT SPOT AT THE 19
[ct=4620.562] 3rd AND 14.
[ct=4621.245] >> Kirk: THERE’S VANCE
[ct=4622.206] JOSEPH, DEFENSIVE
[ct=4624.134] WE’VE TALKED ABOUT A
[ct=4625.153] BIT TONIGHT, ONE OF
[ct=4625.699] THE BEST IN THE
[ct=4627.309] EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT
[ct=4628.694] THAT GAME IN MIAMI.
[ct=4630.001] SINCE THAT MIAMI GAME,
[ct=4630.230] THIS DEFENSE HAS
[ct=4631.510] TURNED THE CORNER AND
[ct=4634.051] HAS PLAYED LIKE A
[ct=4635.365] DIFFERENT OUT FIELD,
[ct=4636.679] WITH CONFIDENCE
[ct=4639.361] ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR.
[ct=4641.962] STEPPING UP, AWAY FROM
[ct=4645.342] HERE HE GOES AGAIN.
[ct=4646.134] GETS HIT AT THE END OF
[ct=4648.015] THE PLAY, AND THERE’S
[ct=4650.149] THE FLAG.
[ct=4657.661] JUSTIN STRNAD CAME IN
[ct=4658.351] LATE.
[ct=4658.978] THETS FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4660.241] >> Kirk: IT’S NOT HOW
[ct=4661.163] PHYSICAL, HOW
[ct=4667.804] AGGRESSIVE IT IS.
[ct=4672.942] STRAND
[ct=4673.619] STRNAD HE GIVES
[ct=4674.325] HIMSELF UP.
[ct=4675.016] >> Al: THEY’RE GOING
[ct=4675.915] TO DISCUSS WHETHER
[ct=4676.857] THEY WANT TO PICK THE
[ct=4677.752] FLAG UP OR NOT.
[ct=4680.352] THEY DON’T.
[ct=4681.635] >> Kirk: I DON’T THINK
[ct=4682.496] ANY TIME -- THIS IS A
[ct=4683.500] BETTER LOOK AT IT
[ct=4684.288] RIGHT HERE.
[ct=4685.457] ANY TIME YOU SEE A
[ct=4686.162] QUARTERBACK, AGAIN,
[ct=4687.605] GIVE HIMSELF UP LIKE
[ct=4690.771] THAT, STRNAD, HE’S
[ct=4690.977] FRUSTRATED BECAUSE
[ct=4691.687] THEY DIDN’T FEEL LIKE
[ct=4692.286] THEY HIT HIM THAT
[ct=4693.803] HARD, BUT HE WAS DOWN,
[ct=4694.578] KNEE WAS DOWN.
[ct=4695.063] YOU FOLLOW THROUGH
[ct=4696.087] LIKE THAT, THAT’S A
[ct=4697.934] PENALTY.
[ct=4698.146] >> Al: TRYING NOT TO,
[ct=4698.733] YEAH.
[ct=4699.279] YOU’RE IN
[ct=4701.002] NO-MAN’S-LAND AT THAT
[ct=4701.802] >> Kirk: BY THE WAY,
[ct=4702.515] THAT WAS GOING TO BE
[ct=4703.622] FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=4706.656] INSTEAD 1st AND GOAL.
[ct=4709.654] EDWARDS IN IS IN
[ct=4712.153] EDWARDS FINDS SPACE.
[ct=4715.216] TOUCHDOWN, CHARGERS.
[ct=4725.558] 24-19, HARBAUGH SAYING
[ct=4726.857] LET’S GO FOR 2 TO MAKE
[ct=4728.222] IT A 3-POINT GAME.
[ct=4729.553] SO A HUGE PERSONAL
[ct=4730.945] FOUL CALLED, SETS HIM
[ct=4733.420] INSTEAD OF GOING FOR
[ct=4734.904] 3, THEY’RE GOING TO
[ct=4735.823] GET 7.
[ct=4739.156] GREAT BLOCK BY
[ct=4741.460] PIPKINS, FISK LEADING
[ct=4744.756] REALLY NICE JOB
[ct=4744.955] ADJUSTING BY THE
[ct=4746.485] BRONCOS DEFENSE.
[ct=4746.819] BOTH THOSE GUYS HAD
[ct=4749.082] GOOD BLOCKING ANGLES
[ct=4749.313] AND A GOOD
[ct=4751.876] READ BY EDWARDS TO GET
[ct=4753.570] IT INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=4754.989] >> Al: EDWARDS THE
[ct=4760.000] BACK, JAUNSSON TO THE
[ct=4760.452] LEFT, PALMER TO THE
[ct=4761.030] RIGHT, McCONKEY IN THE
[ct=4761.404] LEFT SLOT TO THE
[ct=4765.344] EDWARDS IN MOTION.
[ct=4767.954] KEEP IT.
[ct=4768.102] AND DOES HE GET TO THE
[ct=4769.369] GOAL LINE?
[ct=4770.074] HE DOES NOT!
[ct=4775.969] NIK BONITTO IS RIGHT
[ct=4777.318] THERE HAVING A
[ct=4778.642] TREMENDOUS SEASON AND
[ct=4779.967] MAKES A BIG, BIG PLAY.
[ct=4781.215] >> Kirk: YOU’RE RIGHT.
[ct=4781.943] BONITTO IS THE PASS
[ct=4783.192] RUSHER, RIGHT?
[ct=4784.243] THIS GUY GETS OFF OF A
[ct=4785.486] BLOCK BY ONE OF THESE
[ct=4788.505] BIG FULL BACKS, 42,
[ct=4792.890] FISK, AND GETS DOWN
[ct=4793.572] AND MAKES THE PLAY.
[ct=4795.346] STARTS NEXT OCTOBER.
[ct=4797.930] SoFi STADIUM OPENED IN
[ct=4799.067] 2000.
[ct=4801.008] DID THE FIRST GAME
[ct=4801.981] HERE WITH CHRIS
[ct=4804.090] COLLINSWORTH.
[ct=4805.133] NO FANS, COVID YEAR.
[ct=4806.037] RAMS AND THE DALLAS
[ct=4810.560] COWBOYS.
[ct=4811.061] $1.5 BILLION STADIUM.
[ct=4812.058] MEANWHILE, IF THE
[ct=4813.015] SEASON ENDED RIGHT
[ct=4814.127] NOW, AND IT WON’T JUST
[ct=4815.147] IN CASE YOU’RE
[ct=4817.119] WONDERING HERE’S HOW
[ct=4818.568] THE WILD CARD MATCH
[ct=4819.465] WOULD.
[ct=4819.727] BRONCOS GO TO
[ct=4824.099] PITTSBURGH TO PLAY
[ct=4825.437] STEELERS AND RAVE RNZ
[ct=4825.835] WOULD PLAY THE TEXANS
[ct=4826.797] IN THE MATCHUP.
[ct=4827.561] A LOT CAN HAPPEN
[ct=4828.443] BETWEEN NOW AND THEN,
[ct=4829.615] BUT THE BRONCOS CAN
[ct=4831.732] CLENCH A SPOT TONIGHT.
[ct=4832.886] YOU’VE GOT BALTIMORE
[ct=4834.342] AND PITTSBURGH GOING
[ct=4835.280] BACK AND FORTH, YOU
[ct=4838.233] KNOW, AND -- AND DOES
[ct=4839.457] KANSAS CITY KEEP THE
[ct=4840.503] NUMBER ONE SEED.
[ct=4842.682] >> Kirk: WHETS YOUR
[ct=4843.212] APPETITE AND GETS YOU
[ct=4844.205] EXCITED WHAT COULD BE
[ct=4846.605] HERE IN THE NEXT FEW
[ct=4846.779] WEEKS.
[ct=4847.170] >> Al: FROM THE 30
[ct=4848.718] START THIS DRIVE WITH
[ct=4850.424] A LOSS BEHIND THE LINE
[ct=4853.989] OF SCRIMMAGE AS BLAKE
[ct=4855.543] WATSON GOES NOWHERE.
[ct=4855.991] TO THE FIELD TO
[ct=4856.843] KAYLEE.
[ct=4858.207] >> GUYS, JUSTIN
[ct=4859.332] HERBERT WAS GETTING A
[ct=4860.911] CUT ON HIS RIGHT ELBOW
[ct=4863.565] TENDED TO.
[ct=4864.642] HE’S TREATING IT LIKE
[ct=4865.500] IT’S NOTHING MORE THAN
[ct=4866.153] A PAPER CUT, I WOULD
[ct=4866.708] SAY.
[ct=4867.974] THE BIGGER PROBLEM FOR
[ct=4869.174] THE CHARGERS DEFENSE,
[ct=4869.912] THOUGH, IS THAT
[ct=4871.157] LINEBACKER DENZEL
[ct=4871.869] PERRYMAN IS
[ct=4872.696] RETURN.
[ct=4873.571] WE HAVEN’T SEEN HIM
[ct=4874.675] SINCE HE WENT INTO THE
[ct=4876.043] LOCKER ROOM DURING
[ct=4876.788] HALF TIME.
[ct=4877.863] TONIGHT WAS HIS FIRST
[ct=4878.882] GAME BACK AFTER
[ct=4879.790] MISSING FOUR GAMES
[ct=4882.249] WITH A GROIN INJURY.
[ct=4885.074] IT’S ACTING UP AGAIN.
[ct=4891.192] >> Al: YEAH, HADN’T
[ct=4894.424] ONCE TONIGHT WHEN HE
[ct=4894.597] WAS OUT THERE.
[ct=4895.056] LITTLE SWING PASS,
[ct=4895.788] AND 3rd AND 8 COMING
[ct=4896.527] >> Kirk: NOW THEY LOOK
[ct=4897.164] LIKE THEY’RE FLYING
[ct=4897.783] AROUND A LITTLE BIT,
[ct=4899.418] PLAYING WITH A
[ct=4900.716] DIFFERENT ENERGY, BIG
[ct=4902.427] OPPORTUNITY.
[ct=4903.327] THE CROWD’S BACK INTO
[ct=4908.304] KIND OF 50-50 SPLIT OF
[ct=4909.025] THE CROWD, BY THE WAY.
[ct=4910.319] IT’S ALWAYS A BIG
[ct=4911.284] STORY ANY TIME THERE’S
[ct=4912.291] A HOME GAME FOR THE
[ct=4914.372] A LOT OF BRONCOS FANS
[ct=4914.934] HERE IN TOWN.
[ct=4915.745] BUT RIGHT NOW THESE
[ct=4916.644] CHARGERS FANS ARE
[ct=4918.897] MAKING A LOT OF NOISE
[ct=4920.750] ON THIS THIRD DOWN.
[ct=4925.326] AND RAMS ALL PRACTICE
[ct=4928.545] SILENT COUNTS FOR HOME
[ct=4928.733] GAMES.
[ct=4935.090] 3rd AND 8.
[ct=4936.210] NIX THROWING,
[ct=4937.263] CONTESTED, AND WHO’S
[ct=4937.649] GOT IT?
[ct=4939.427] A FIGHT FOR THE BALL.
[ct=4940.775] YOU’VE GOT JAMES,
[ct=4942.105] YOU’VE GOT WILLIAMS.
[ct=4943.167] CHARGERS THINK THEY
[ct=4943.802] HAVE IT.
[ct=4946.208] DERWIN JAMES CAME UP
[ct=4946.364] WITH THAT.
[ct=4947.276] AS THEY HIT THE
[ct=4948.224] GROUND, HE WAS TAKING
[ct=4948.780] THAT FOOTBALL
[ct=4951.720] >> Al: CLAY MARTIN IS
[ct=4952.596] WHAT’S HE GOING TO
[ct=4954.386] TELL US?
[ct=4959.842] WHO’S GOT IT?
[ct=4962.738] MARTIN, HE PATS JAMES.
[ct=4964.101] >> Kirk: BUT HE GAVE
[ct=4965.462] THAT TO THE BRONCOS.
[ct=4966.439] I’LL TELL YOU, WHEN
[ct=4967.874] THEY HIT THE GROUND,
[ct=4969.916] IT SURE LOOK LIKE LIVE
[ct=4972.361] THAT HE DID A GOOD JOB
[ct=4973.016] OF STEALING THAT
[ct=4974.464] FOOTBALL, FIGHTING FOR
[ct=4974.974] LET’S SEE.
[ct=4976.819] HERE’S A GOOD LOOK AT
[ct=4978.115] THAT.
[ct=4979.232] SEE THAT, WELL, MAYBE
[ct=4982.443] WILLIAMS STILL HAD IT.
[ct=4982.617] MAYBE HE USED HIS
[ct=4983.810] STRENGTH TO KEEP IT
[ct=4985.823] AWAY FROM HIM.
[ct=4986.633] >> Al: TIE GOES TO THE
[ct=4987.801] RUNNER.
[ct=4990.442] RILEY DIXON.
[ct=4991.806] PLOPS IT OUT OF BOUNDS
[ct=4992.469] JUST AROUND THE 20
[ct=4997.340] SO 45 SECONDS ARE LEFT
[ct=5005.944] IN THE PENULTIMATE
[ct=5007.079] QUARTER, OTHERWISE
[ct=5008.236] KNOWN AS NEXT TO LAST.
[ct=5011.302] AND IT’S 24-19. SEASON.
[ct=5014.989] TAKE A LOOK, AL, AT
[ct=5016.106] OUR NEXT GEN STATS
[ct=5020.068] JUSTIN HERBERT, HE’S
[ct=5021.094] SECOND IN THE ENTIRE
[ct=5021.598] LEAGUE WHEN IT COMES
[ct=5022.793] TO PLAY ACTION.
[ct=5024.995] YOU CAN SEE 10-10
[ct=5025.433] ENTERING THIS DRIVE
[ct=5026.365] UTILIZING PLAY ACTION
[ct=5027.043] AND GETTING INTO THAT
[ct=5028.264] RHYTHM THAT HE FINDS
[ct=5033.057] WITH THAT LOOK.
[ct=5034.359] >> Al: OFF THE FAKE,
[ct=5036.001] DANCING, THROWING,
[ct=5037.387] CAUGHT ON THE RUN.
[ct=5038.687] THAT’S JOSHUA PALMER.
[ct=5039.935] WE HAD A LOOK AT THAT
[ct=5044.145] ARM, THAT ELBOW.
[ct=5044.836] KAYLEE CALLED IT A
[ct=5045.970] BRUSH BURN.
[ct=5047.364] SO THE ANKLE SEEMS TO
[ct=5048.076] BE FINE AND THE ELBOW
[ct=5049.301] SEEMS TO BE FINE AT
[ct=5050.279] LEAST RIGHT NOW ON
[ct=5050.999] THIS FIRST PASS.
[ct=5051.929] >> Kirk: AND SO DOES
[ct=5052.911] THE PASS PROTECTION.
[ct=5053.682] HE WORKED THROUGH HIS
[ct=5054.901] PROGRESSTIONS.
[ct=5055.328] IT WAS ALMOST LIKE
[ct=5056.611] WATCHING A VIDEO GAME.
[ct=5057.366] YOU’RE WATCHING HIM
[ct=5058.068] SIT BACK THERE AND
[ct=5060.644] JUST THREW AN ABSOLUTE
[ct=5061.393] LASER RIGHT ON THE
[ct=5062.556] MONEY.
[ct=5065.874] NOW 11-11 OFF OF THAT
[ct=5068.362] PLAY ACTION LOOK.
[ct=5069.782] >> Al: AND 17 OF 20
[ct=5071.055] WHICH IS 89% ON THE
[ct=5078.242] NIGHT FOR 184 YARDS.
[ct=5080.343] SECONDS OF THE QUARTER
[ct=5082.069] AND TAKE THE BALL OUT
[ct=5083.152] TO THE 39 YARD LINE
[ct=5084.130] AND THAT’S WHERE WE’LL
[ct=5086.278] START THE FOURTH
[ct=5086.632] QUARTER ON THIS
[ct=5087.281] THURSDAY NIGHT WITH
[ct=5094.983] >> Al: NO MATTER THE
[ct=5097.000] OUTCOME OF THIS ONE
[ct=5097.483] THOSE THREE TEAMS AT
[ct=5098.919] THE TOP, RANGERS,
[ct=5101.699] BRONCOS, CHARGERS IN
[ct=5102.610] GREAT SHAPE TO GET TO
[ct=5113.155] MEANWHILE COLTS,
[ct=5113.591] DOLPHINS, AND BENGALS
[ct=5114.317] SITTING ON THE OUTSIDE
[ct=5114.708] NEEDING A LOT OF HELP.
[ct=5116.236] >> Kirk: KANSAS CITY
[ct=5118.008] YOU NEVER KNOW WITH
[ct=5119.567] MUHOLD IF THEY MIGHT
[ct=5121.121] REST HIM.
[ct=5123.151] STILL YOU RATHER TAKE
[ct=5123.491] CARE OF BUSINESS
[ct=5125.079] >> Al: SURE, AL
[ct=5125.553] MICHAELS, KIRK
[ct=5127.038] HERBSTREIT, KAYLEE
[ct=5127.778] HARTUNG.
[ct=5128.990] HERE WE GO ON A FOURTH
[ct=5130.453] QUARTER ON 2nd AND 6
[ct=5131.942] AS THE CHARGERS HAVE
[ct=5133.672] THE BALL ON THEIR 38
[ct=5140.925] ADKINS, THROWING,
[ct=5145.843] THERE’S A FLAG DOWN.
[ct=5148.526] JONATHAN COOPER CAME
[ct=5151.189] CLAY MARTIN WAS RIGHT
[ct=5154.233] >> Kirk: THEY GOT HIM
[ct=5156.443] WITH A HORSE COLLAR
[ct=5158.963] COOPER CHASING FROM
[ct=5159.409] BEHIND.
[ct=5161.760] >> Referee: PERSONAL
[ct=5163.117] FOUL HORSE COLLAR
[ct=5165.094] TACKLE, DEFENSE NUMBER
[ct=5168.534] 0.
[ct=5169.850] 15-YARD PENALTY.
[ct=5170.688] AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5172.121] >> Kirk: ANY TIME
[ct=5172.831] YOU’RE CHASING FROM
[ct=5174.229] BEHIND AND YOU REACH
[ct=5175.700] UP HIGH, YOU’RE DOING
[ct=5177.739] EVERYTHING YOU CAN NOT
[ct=5178.229] TO GRAB HOLD OF THAT
[ct=5179.274] JERSEY AND PULL THAT
[ct=5180.283] GUY DOWN, BUT THAT’S
[ct=5180.924] WHAT HE DID.
[ct=5182.450] THAT IS A BIG FIRST
[ct=5184.775] THEY’RE CROSS MIDNLD
[ct=5185.706] NOW AFTER THAT
[ct=5188.127] >> Al: BIG PENALTY AT
[ct=5190.433] THE END OF THE HALF TO
[ct=5190.888] SETUP THAT FREE KICK.
[ct=5192.367] NOW THIS ONE MOVES THE
[ct=5194.402] BALL TO THE DENVER
[ct=5194.846] SIDE OF THE 50-YARD
[ct=5200.278] THE 47 YARD LINE.
[ct=5201.539] FIVE PENALTIES AGAINST
[ct=5202.751] DENVER TONIGHT, ONLY
[ct=5204.369] ONE ACCEPTED AGAINST
[ct=5217.724] THE CHARGERS.
[ct=5221.943] FROM THE PISTOL.
[ct=5224.768] OFF THE FAKE, STEPPING
[ct=5226.926] UP, THROW’S
[ct=5229.559] UNDERNEATH.
[ct=5229.559] KNOCKED DOWN TO THE
[ct=5232.111] HERBERT HAS A LOT OF
[ct=5233.669] PASSES BATTED DOWN.
[ct=5234.519] >> Kirk: YEAH, YEAH.
[ct=5235.357] I WAS GOING TO SAY
[ct=5236.855] WE’VE TALKED SO MUCH
[ct=5238.361] ABOUT DENVER’S
[ct=5238.748] OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=5239.901] YOU KNOW, THE BRONCOS,
[ct=5240.980] YOU SAID EARLIER THEY
[ct=5242.311] LEAD THE NFL IN SACKS.
[ct=5244.172] ONLY ONE SACK TONIGHT.
[ct=5245.876] FOR THE MOST PART HE’S
[ct=5247.225] BEEN PRETTY CLEAN AND
[ct=5248.460] THAT’S BEEN SUCH AN
[ct=5248.848] EMPHASIS FROM GREG
[ct=5250.614] ROMAN.
[ct=5251.050] IT’S, LISTEN, WE HAVE
[ct=5251.861] ONE OF THE BEST
[ct=5252.666] QUARTERBACKS IN THE
[ct=5254.019] HE NEEDS TIME AND HE
[ct=5255.206] NEEDS SPACE, AND
[ct=5257.047] THEY’VE GIVEN IT TO
[ct=5260.903] HIM TONIGHT.
[ct=5269.560] AGAIN UNDER PRESSURE,
[ct=5269.963] GETS THE PASS AWAY.
[ct=5271.410] THERE’S A FLAG AS WE
[ct=5273.487] SEE ON THE FAR SIDE OF
[ct=5274.429] THE FIELD.
[ct=5275.400] VIDAL TACKLED THERE BY
[ct=5277.679] CODY BARTON.
[ct=5280.359] THAT WAS A 2nd AND 10
[ct=5283.026] CHARGERS ARE FOR THE
[ct=5285.846] MOMENT SEEMING TO BACK
[ct=5288.317] BUT, NO, IT’S GOING TO
[ct=5288.793] BE OFFSIDE.
[ct=5292.240] NOW HE WANTS TO
[ct=5292.240] KNOW --
[ct=5296.230] DEFENSE NUMBER 99.
[ct=5296.655] >> Kirk: ZACH ALLEN IS
[ct=5297.712] BEING CLOSE.
[ct=5298.981] SOMETIMES YOU SEE THIS
[ct=5300.064] OFFENSIVE TACKLES,
[ct=5304.045] THEY GET AWAY WITH IT.
[ct=5305.412] ZACH ALLEN HAS GOTTEN
[ct=5306.357] OFF WITH ONE OR TWO.
[ct=5308.111] HE HAD SUCH GOOD GET
[ct=5311.116] OFF, THAT TIME MAYBE A
[ct=5315.906] LITTLE BIT PREMATURE.
[ct=5317.923] >> Al: SO THAT’S GOING
[ct=5320.620] TO MAKE IT A 2nd AND 5
[ct=5321.944] WITH THE BALL AT THE
[ct=5330.504] 42 YARD LINE.
[ct=5335.482] VIDAL.
[ct=5338.683] RUNS INTO THE ZONE AND
[ct=5339.849] MATLOCK.
[ct=5340.180] DENVER WITH GOOD
[ct=5341.099] PRESSURE THAT TIME
[ct=5342.444] STOPPING HIM, GOOD
[ct=5343.425] RUN, STOPPAGE AT THE
[ct=5348.719] 5.
[ct=5350.952] >> Kirk: HE’S BEEN
[ct=5351.513] WHAT VANCE JOSEPH
[ct=5352.733] WOULD TELL YOU ONE OF
[ct=5353.678] THE BIG SURPRISES GREG
[ct=5355.505] ROMAN AND HIS OFFENSE
[ct=5357.161] HAS HAD TO DEAL WITH.
[ct=5358.295] VANCE JOSEPH SAYING,
[ct=5359.739] LISTEN, WHEN WE LOST
[ct=5361.028] SINGLETON WE WERE
[ct=5361.588] TERRIFIED.
[ct=5362.492] WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS
[ct=5363.447] DEFENSE AND HOW WE’VE
[ct=5364.751] IMPROVED, NUMBER 40
[ct=5365.678] HAS MADE A BIG
[ct=5366.434] DIFFERENCE FOR US.
[ct=5367.485] MADE A GREAT PLAY
[ct=5371.067] >> Al: HASKINS COMES
[ct=5373.941] IN AS THE THIRD DOWN
[ct=5375.418] BRONCOS LOOK LIKE
[ct=5376.918] THEY’RE COMING.
[ct=5378.265] EIGHT GUYS UP AT THE
[ct=5379.572] HERE THEY COME.
[ct=5381.666] PASS IS THROWN AND
[ct=5382.409] CAUGHT, AND A FLAG IS
[ct=5385.375] DOWN AT THE 43 YARD
[ct=5387.987] >> Kirk: I ALWAYS
[ct=5388.914] WONDER IF THEY LINED
[ct=5389.870] UP IN THE NEUTRAL ZONE
[ct=5391.036] AS A DEFENSE.
[ct=5391.575] THEY HAD EVERYBODY UP
[ct=5392.996] >> Al: THEY DID.
[ct=5393.720] CATCH MADE BY
[ct=5398.804] JOHNSTON.
[ct=5401.465] >> Referee: OFFSIDE,
[ct=5401.629] DEFENSE NUMBER 92
[ct=5402.786] LINING UP IN THE
[ct=5404.112] NEUTRAL ZONE.
[ct=5406.749] PENALTY IS DECLINED.
[ct=5406.749] >> Kirk: THINK
[ct=5409.430] THESE MISTAKES THAT
[ct=5409.430] ARE COSTING THIS
[ct=5410.920] BRONCOS TEAM.
[ct=5412.279] END OF THE FIRST HALF
[ct=5413.619] THEY GAVE THE 3
[ct=5414.944] POINTS, DECLINED THIS
[ct=5417.202] BUT STILL, YOU’D LIKE
[ct=5418.308] TO AVOID HELPING THE
[ct=5419.256] CHARGERS OUT.
[ct=5420.040] THEY GOT THE MOMENTUM
[ct=5422.221] >> Al: THAT ONE WAS
[ct=5424.037] CALLED ON TILLMAN.
[ct=5424.814] HE HAD THE PERSONAL
[ct=5425.553] FOUL EARLIER ON
[ct=5429.529] COOPER.
[ct=5431.010] 1:30 INTO THE FOURTH.
[ct=5437.715] CLEAN POCKET.
[ct=5443.295] THROW IS CAUGHT.
[ct=5446.786] McCONKEY, PUNTS IT
[ct=5448.318] BACK TO THE 23 YARD
[ct=5451.038] LADD McCONKEY WHAT A
[ct=5451.038] DIFFERENCE HE’S HAD
[ct=5454.301] THIS CAREER.
[ct=5456.369] TRADED KEENAN ALLEN.
[ct=5457.118] McCONKEY COMES IN AS
[ct=5458.387] THE NUMBER ONE GUY.
[ct=5459.521] >> Kirk: THEY LOSE THE
[ct=5461.874] MESH CONCEPT AND DELAY
[ct=5464.695] BY McCONKEY.
[ct=5466.097] GREG ROLLIN’ AND HIS
[ct=5466.834] OFFENSIVE STAFF THEY
[ct=5467.561] DON’T HAVE A TON OF
[ct=5468.391] WEAPONS ON THE
[ct=5470.660] OFFENSIVE SIDE, BUT
[ct=5471.344] THEY’RE COMING UP WITH
[ct=5471.946] CREATIVE WAYS TO MAKE
[ct=5472.880] SPACE TO GIVE HIM A
[ct=5473.984] CHANCE TO NOT ONLY
[ct=5476.513] MAKE CATCHES BUT TO
[ct=5476.987] HAVE A CHANCE TO RUN
[ct=5478.689] AFTER THE CATCH.
[ct=5480.014] >> Al: EIGHT STRAIGHT
[ct=5482.446] WITH 50 OR MORE
[ct=5485.114] RECEIVING YARDS.
[ct=5487.843] THROW’S, CAUGHT!
[ct=5491.780] TOUCHDOWN, DERIUS
[ct=5491.952] DAVIS.
[ct=5495.622] AND THE CHARGERS TAKE
[ct=5498.789] THE LEAD ON A 19-YARD
[ct=5499.983] TOUCHDOWN PASS.
[ct=5504.550] >> Kirk: AL, I JUST
[ct=5505.515] TALKED ABOUT GREG
[ct=5506.247] ROMAN COMING UP WITH
[ct=5507.791] WAYS TO FIND MATCHUPS.
[ct=5508.892] AND HERE’S THE MOTION
[ct=5510.930] WATCH THE DEFENSE
[ct=5512.779] REACT LATE.
[ct=5516.406] EVENTUALLY 6, P.J.
[ct=5517.813] LOCKE COMES DOWN, BUT
[ct=5520.571] THIS IS ALL JUSTIN
[ct=5523.250] WITH THAT GIMPY ANKLE
[ct=5523.828] I THINK HE WAS
[ct=5524.891] THINKING ABOUT FINDING
[ct=5525.912] THE BALL LAST MINUTE.
[ct=5526.871] HE LOCATES HIS OPEN
[ct=5528.159] RECEIVER AND MAKES THE
[ct=5532.630] THROW TO DERIUS DAVIS.
[ct=5533.912] WHAT A GUTTAE EFFORT
[ct=5534.129] AGAIN BY THE
[ct=5536.620] QUARTERBACK HERBERT.
[ct=5537.171] >> Al: DAVIS WITH HIS
[ct=5539.791] FIRST CAREER RECEIVING
[ct=5541.056] TOUCH DOWN HAD ONE ON
[ct=5543.599] A PUNT RETURN, SECOND
[ct=5544.916] YEAR OUT OF TCU.
[ct=5545.322] HASKINS IN THE
[ct=5547.985] FAKE TO HIM.
[ct=5548.903] HERBERT STEPS UP,
[ct=5552.143] THROWS, AND IS IT
[ct=5553.340] ONE-HANDED CAUGHT?
[ct=5554.635] YES, IT IS.
[ct=5555.219] JOSHUA PALMER WITH AN
[ct=5561.054] AMAZING CATCH.
[ct=5561.615] GO DANCE ALONG THE
[ct=5563.451] BACK LINE, REACH UP
[ct=5565.577] ONE HAND, HAULS IT IN.
[ct=5566.988] >> Kirk: HOW ABOUT HE
[ct=5567.159] BATS THE BALL UP TO
[ct=5568.013] HIMSELF.
[ct=5568.369] HE’S BEEN WAITING TO
[ct=5569.501] HAVE A CHANCE TO HAVE
[ct=5570.302] AN IMPACT AND MAKE A
[ct=5571.202] PLAY TO HELP THESE
[ct=5572.331] GUYS OUT.
[ct=5573.423] THERE’S JIM HARBAUGH
[ct=5580.987] GIVING HIM A HUG.
[ct=5582.327] LOOK, TAPS, LEANS,
[ct=5582.918] GETS HIS FEET DOWN.
[ct=5584.608] >> Al: AMAZING.
[ct=5585.216] 3-POINT L.A. LEAD.
[ct=5594.354] >> Al: HERE IT IS
[ct=5595.283] IT’S HERBERT.
[ct=5596.174] HE’S GOING TO GET IT
[ct=5599.867] TIPPED AT THE LINE OF
[ct=5601.202] SCRIMMAGE BARELY.
[ct=5601.767] >> Kirk: THAT’S GREAT
[ct=5602.507] EFFORT BUT THIS
[ct=5603.852] AMAZING CONCENTRATION.
[ct=5604.940] LOOK AT THIS BALL,
[ct=5610.773] TIPPED BY STRNAD.
[ct=5611.423] MAKES THAT MUCH MORE
[ct=5612.973] IMPRESSIVE AND THE
[ct=5614.233] CONCENTRATION AND
[ct=5617.460] 2-POINTER BY PALMER.
[ct=5618.249] >> Al: ALMOST EVERY
[ct=5618.779] WEEK AND EVERY GAME WE
[ct=5623.109] SEE AMAZING CATCHES.
[ct=5625.705] ODELL BECKHAM, HE
[ct=5626.812] BROKE THE SEAL ON ALL
[ct=5627.367] THIS STUFF BACK IN
[ct=5630.254] 2014.
[ct=5636.553] >>> BACK AT SoFi
[ct=5640.819] STADIUM.
[ct=5641.720] 12:23 LEFT IN THE
[ct=5643.324] FOURTH.
[ct=5646.452] CHARGERS ON TOP 27-24.
[ct=5647.173] DENVER TRYING TO
[ct=5650.152] CLENCH A PLAYOFF SPOT.
[ct=5650.152] CHARGERS TRYING TO
[ct=5654.126] MAKE IT A 97%
[ct=5654.496] PROBABILITY WITH A
[ct=5657.170] VICTORY.
[ct=5657.655] DRIVE STARTING FROM
[ct=5662.689] THE 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=5668.847] BACK IN THIS
[ct=5671.585] TO 5.
[ct=5671.819] ESTIME SECOND DOWN.
[ct=5672.362] >> Kirk: WE TALKED
[ct=5673.351] ABOUT THE DEFENSE AND
[ct=5675.003] WHERE’S THE ENERGY.
[ct=5675.910] IT’S TWO WEEKS IN A
[ct=5676.633] ROW THEY’VE BEEN A
[ct=5677.780] LITTLE SLUGGISH.
[ct=5678.524] BOY, THEY’VE TURNED
[ct=5679.891] THINGS AROUND THE
[ct=5680.037] SECOND HALF.
[ct=5681.595] THINK ABOUT THE FIRST
[ct=5682.679] HALF TO SECOND HALF.
[ct=5685.572] LOOK AT THE YARDS.
[ct=5685.572] THE DRIVE CHART.
[ct=5686.856] DENVER STARTED THIS
[ct=5687.219] GAME THEIR FIRST THREE
[ct=5688.591] POSSESSIONS TOUCHDOWN,
[ct=5691.042] TOUCHDOWN, TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=5692.357] SINCE THEN IT’S PUNT,
[ct=5693.719] PUNT, FIELD GOAL, AND
[ct=5694.295] PUNT.
[ct=5696.530] SO THE ADJUSTMENTS
[ct=5696.708] HAVE BEEN MADE.
[ct=5697.705] THE ENERGY IN THIS
[ct=5698.834] DEFENSE IS FLYING
[ct=5700.908] AROUND HERE THESE LAST
[ct=5707.505] FEW POSSESSIONS.
[ct=5710.238] >> Al: 2nd AND 5.
[ct=5711.418] AND DOWN HE GOES.
[ct=5714.404] HE GETS IT AWAY, THE
[ct=5723.000] PRESSURE PUT ON BY
[ct=5723.173] PRESSURE PUT ON .
[ct=5729.366] 3rd DOWN AND 5.
[ct=5731.823] >> Kirk: TELL YOU
[ct=5731.989] WHAT’S BEEN
[ct=5737.180] INTERESTING HERE IS BO
[ct=5737.769] NIX HAS NOT BEEN
[ct=5738.172] GETTING THE BALL
[ct=5738.700] DOWNFIELD AT ALL
[ct=5739.874] IN FACT, IF YOU LOOK
[ct=5740.966] AT THE AVERAGE
[ct=5742.266] DISTANCE TONIGHT, 2.6
[ct=5742.783] AIR YARDS.
[ct=5744.500] THAT’S THE SHORTEST BY
[ct=5744.851] ANY QUARTERBACK THE
[ct=5745.820] ENTIRE YEAR.
[ct=5756.397] >> Al: 3rd DOWN AND 5.
[ct=5761.735] ONLY A THREE-MAN RUSH.
[ct=5764.411] NIX DUMPS IT OFF,
[ct=5764.411] CAUGHT, AND TAKING IT
[ct=5765.861] OUT TO ALMOST MIDFIELD
[ct=5770.067] IS MICHAEL BURTON.
[ct=5772.901] SO THE SAFETY.
[ct=5775.333] MAKES THE PLAY, PICKS
[ct=5776.309] UP THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5777.711] >> Kirk: HENLEY
[ct=5778.281] ACTUALLY HAS BURTON
[ct=5779.743] OUT OF THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=5780.924] DELAY, DELAY.
[ct=5782.871] HE LETS HIM GO.
[ct=5783.714] JUST FREE RELEASE AND
[ct=5785.377] A GOOD JOB BY BO NIX,
[ct=5787.891] ALL THIS PRESSURE,
[ct=5788.510] LOUD AS THIS STADIUM
[ct=5788.838] HAS BEEN ALL NIGHT,
[ct=5789.411] AND HE FINDS THAT
[ct=5791.010] CHECK DOWN ONCE AGAIN
[ct=5792.593] WHO GETS AWAY FROM
[ct=5793.570] HENLEY WHO LOST HIS
[ct=5797.586] THAT TIME LOOKING FOR
[ct=5799.068] NIX AS A THREAT TO
[ct=5800.202] POTENTIALLY SCRAMBLE
[ct=5803.922] FOR THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5803.922] >> Al: ROOKIE WATSON
[ct=5806.599] IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=5807.710] PLAY FAKE.
[ct=5808.479] GOING DEEP!
[ct=5809.434] HAS A MAN, AND IT’S
[ct=5811.332] GOING TO BE BROKEN UP
[ct=5812.610] AT THE VERY END.
[ct=5815.400] INTENDED FOR MIMS.
[ct=5816.018] TARHEEB STILL WAS ABLE
[ct=5818.150] TO GET BACK THERE.
[ct=5819.524] HIGH FLOATER GAVE
[ct=5820.621] STILL ENOUGH TIME TO
[ct=5821.207] GET BACK AND MAKE THE
[ct=5823.149] >> Kirk: YEAH, JUST
[ct=5824.071] TALKED ABOUT HOW IT’S
[ct=5824.864] BEEN A LOT OF SHORT
[ct=5825.587] PROS.
[ct=5826.376] THEY’RE SAVING THESE
[ct=5827.523] DEEPER SHOTS FOR THE
[ct=5828.716] FOURTH QUARTER, OUT
[ct=5828.913] AND UP.
[ct=5829.979] AND THE ROOKIE FELL
[ct=5831.187] FOR IT.
[ct=5832.053] THE BALL IS LATE.
[ct=5833.149] IT WAS HIGH IN THE AIR
[ct=5834.260] BUT IT WAS LATE, AND
[ct=5836.538] THAT’S WHY THE BALL
[ct=5837.264] WAS UNDERTHROWN.
[ct=5839.750] THAT’S A TOUCHDOWN IF
[ct=5840.715] HE SEES IT AND GETS
[ct=5842.176] THE BALL OUT EARLY.
[ct=5843.141] BECAUSE IT’S LATE, IT
[ct=5844.119] GIVES STILL A CHANCE
[ct=5847.136] TO CATCH UP ON IT, AND
[ct=5848.834] SAYS THAT ONE’S ON ME.
[ct=5851.333] NEEDED TO GET IT OUT
[ct=5851.733] EARLIER.
[ct=5853.883] NEEDED ABOUT 3 OR 4
[ct=5855.078] MORE YARDS ON IT AS
[ct=5855.572] WELL.
[ct=5856.895] 2nd DOWN AND 10.
[ct=5857.968] LEFT SIDE, WILLIAMS
[ct=5859.130] STOPPED JUST SHY OF
[ct=5866.505] THE 50 YARD LINE BY
[ct=5869.348] TULI TUIPOLOTU.
[ct=5873.616] >> Kirk: TUIPOLOTU
[ct=5874.497] NICE JOB SETTING THAT
[ct=5875.113] EDGE.
[ct=5875.720] REMEMBER THESE GUYS
[ct=5876.987] WERE PUSHED AROUND IN
[ct=5877.738] THE RUN GAME IN THE
[ct=5879.571] IT’S AMAZING WHEN YOU
[ct=5880.626] PLAY THIS GAME WITH
[ct=5881.433] ENERGY ON THAT
[ct=5883.736] DEFENSIVE SIDE.
[ct=5893.907] >> Al: 3rd AND 8.
[ct=5898.475] RUSH FIVE.
[ct=5899.723] TAKES HIM OUT, THROWS
[ct=5909.475] WATSON AND THE
[ct=5910.389] WILL GET THE BALL BACK
[ct=5911.830] AFTER A 4th AND 8 FOR
[ct=5917.344] >> Kirk: DEFENSE KEEP
[ct=5918.450] DOING THEIR JOB.
[ct=5919.058] TALKING THERE ABOUT AN
[ct=5920.200] ADJUSTMENT MAYBE
[ct=5921.037] WITHIN A ROUTE WITH
[ct=5923.067] BUT NONETHELESS, MAN,
