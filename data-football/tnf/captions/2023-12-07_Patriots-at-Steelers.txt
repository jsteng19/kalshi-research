[ct=5.226] RELY ON MITCH TRUBISKY.
[ct=7.827] AL: THERE IS PICKETT WATCHING
[ct=8.223] FROM A BOX UPSTAIRS.
[ct=10.431] BILL BELICHICK HAS BEEN THE
[ct=12.420] COACH OF THE PATRIOTS SINCE
[ct=12.420] 2000.
[ct=16.155] MIKE TOMLIN TOOK OVER IN 2007.
[ct=22.387] THE TWO LONG-TENURED COACHES
[ct=25.225] MEETING FOR THE 13TH TIME,
[ct=26.415] COUNTING POSTSEASON GAMES, WITH
[ct=29.042] BELICHICK WINNING NINE AND
[ct=29.468] TOMLIN THREE.
[ct=31.889] STEELERS DEFER.
[ct=34.619] TY MONTGOMERY IS BACK TO
[ct=34.789] RECEIVE.
[ct=37.947] A TOUCHBACK BEGINS THINGS WITH
[ct=39.555] BAILEY ZAPPE LEADING HIS
[ct=41.973] OUT TO THE 25 YARD LINE.
[ct=44.805] ZAPPE TOOK OVER FOR MAC JONES
[ct=45.104] LAST WEEK.
[ct=48.555] NOT TOO OFTEN DOES A GUY GET
[ct=50.565] SHUT OUT AND WIND UP WITH
[ct=52.501] ANOTHER START BUT HERE WE ARE,
[ct=53.180] THE SECOND WEEK IN A ROW FOR
[ct=53.395] HIM.
[ct=55.074] KIRK: THAT IS WHERE WE ARE IN
[ct=57.918] 2023 WITH THE PATRIOTS.
[ct=61.381] THEY ARE LOOKING FOR CONSISTENCY
[ct=62.128] AND EFFICIENT PLAY FROM THE
[ct=62.892] QUARTERBACK POSITION.
[ct=65.699] LET'S SEE IF BAILEY ZAPPE CAN DO
[ct=65.906] THAT.
[ct=67.789] AL: LONGTIME COWBOYS ZEKE
[ct=70.501] ELLIOTT IS NOW THE PRIMARY
[ct=71.327] RUNNING BACK, RHAMONDRE
[ct=72.770] STEVENSON WAS HURT LAST WEEK.
[ct=74.297] HE GOES NOWHERE.
[ct=78.316] MINKAH FITZPATRICK, WHO HIMSELF
[ct=79.698] MISSED SEVERAL GAMES.
[ct=82.786] YOU HAVE AN INJURED PLAYER, THAT
[ct=83.191] IS T.J. WATT.
[ct=85.017] OH, BOY.
[ct=88.220] HE GOT HURT LAST WEEK.
[ct=92.155] ON THE VERY FIRST PLAY OF THE
[ct=92.532] GAME, FITZPATRICK MAKES THE
[ct=92.769] PLAY.
[ct=96.939] WATT, FORTUNATELY, GETTING UP ON
[ct=97.123] HIS FEET.
[ct=100.954] KIRK: HE TOOK A BLOW FROM
[ct=102.292] ELLIOTT.
[ct=104.127] WATCH HIM FOLLOW THROUGH WITH
[ct=107.546] THE KNEE INTO THE CHEST AREA OF
[ct=107.741] T.J. WATT.
[ct=110.240] INTO THE FACE, ACTUALLY.
[ct=111.990] ALL HIS MOMENTUM.
[ct=116.352] HE IS A BIG MAN AT 235 POUNDS.
[ct=118.598] AL: HE GOES TO THE SIDELINE,
[ct=119.432] DOES WATT.
[ct=125.568] THAT MEANS NUMBER 51 WILL COME
[ct=126.131] IN FOR AT LEAST ONE PLAY.
[ct=129.362] SECOND DOWN, 10.
[ct=134.849] ZAPPE'S FIRST PASS IS A FLOATER.
[ct=136.149] IT IS CAUGHT.
[ct=137.908] ELLIOTT WITH A NICE MOVE.
[ct=141.224] ZEKE, PICKING UP THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=143.588] ELLIOTT WAS PICKED UP IN THE
[ct=143.815] OFF-SEASON.
[ct=145.766] DALLAS LEAD HIM GO.
[ct=148.150] TONY POLLARD TOOK OVER.
[ct=150.192] RHAMONDRE STEVENSON HAS BEEN THE
[ct=154.146] NUMBER 1 BACK, BUT UNTIL
[ct=154.601] STEVENSON COMES BACK, IT WILL BE
[ct=154.794] ZEKE.
[ct=157.087] KIRK: REALLY GOOD DESIGN BY BILL
[ct=157.310] O’
[ct=157.603] O'BRIEN.
[ct=163.490] RIGHT AS A SUBSTITUTE COMES IN
[ct=166.157] FOR T.J. WATT, HE TESTS HIM AS A
[ct=166.850] PASS DEFENDER IN THE FLAT.
[ct=171.636] AL: ZAPPE IN THE POCKET.
[ct=175.495] ZAPPE, DEEP DOWN FIELD AND THAT
[ct=179.157] IS PULLED IN BY JUJU
[ct=180.052] SMITH-SCHUSTER, THE FORMER
[ct=183.778] STEELER WHO COMES HOME, AND A
[ct=186.971] BIG GAINER THERE, 37 YARDS.
[ct=189.949] COVERED WELL BUT THE PAST IS
[ct=190.735] RIGHT THERE.
[ct=194.819] KIRK: KAZEE NEVER LOCATES THE
[ct=194.819] FOOTBALL.
[ct=197.196] ONE AN EFFORT BY JUJU
[ct=198.585] SMITH-SCHUSTER TO COME BACK TO
[ct=199.689] THE FOOTBALL AND SHOW HIS
[ct=200.008] STRENGTH.
[ct=202.995] THAT IS WHAT HE HAS BEEN KNOWN
[ct=203.795] FOR, STRONG HANDS.
[ct=207.016] AL: WATT COMES BACK IN.
[ct=210.742] SMITH-SCHUSTER LAST TWO KANSAS
[ct=212.525] CITY, WON A RING.
[ct=217.996] ALEX HIGHSMITH MAKES THE STOP ON
[ct=220.530] SECOND AND 9.
[ct=223.879] KIRK: GOOD TO SEE T.J. WATT BACK
[ct=225.294] OUT ON THE FIELD FOR PITTSBURGH.
[ct=229.329] HE HAD TO RECALIBRATE, GET
[ct=229.871] HIMSELF READY.
[ct=231.855] HOW ABOUT THE START FOR NEW
[ct=232.090] ENGLAND?
[ct=236.075] THIS IS AN OFFENSE THAT HAS NOT
[ct=237.868] HAD A LOT OF GOOD THINGS GOING.
[ct=239.934] WE EXPECTED THEM TO RUN ON THE
[ct=241.273] FOOTBALL AND LEAN ON ZEKE
[ct=244.829] BILL O'BRIEN COMES OUT TESTING
[ct=246.248] THE STEELERS ONE-ON-ONE
[ct=246.666] DOWNFIELD.
[ct=248.538] AL: WHY NOT?
[ct=252.984] DEVANTE PARKER IS OUT TONIGHT,
[ct=253.639] THEIR NUMBER ONE RECEIVER.
[ct=255.667] ZAPPE THROWS THAT ONE AWAY.
[ct=258.107] THIRD DOWN AND 9.
[ct=261.256] KIRK: ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT
[ct=263.976] THROWING ON EARLY DOWNS, BILL
[ct=265.555] O'BRIEN KNOWS IT WILL HELP HIS
[ct=265.975] OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=268.367] THERE IS A MAJOR CONCERN WITH
[ct=273.193] ALEX HIGHSMITH ON ONE SIDE
[ct=273.935] AND T.J. WATT ON THE OTHER TO
[ct=275.931] AVOID THESE SITUATIONS, THIRD
[ct=279.667] AND LONG, WHERE WATT AND
[ct=279.667] HIGHSMITH CAN COME AFTER YOU.
[ct=283.904] AL: THEY ARE ALSO AN OFFENSIVE
[ct=285.269] LINE THAT HAS BEEN A TROUBLE
[ct=286.837] SPOT FOR NEW ENGLAND.
[ct=287.925] ZAPPE.
[ct=293.709] COMING OUT OF THE SIDE DOOR AND
[ct=294.182] HE WILL PICK UP THE FIRST DOWN
[ct=297.395] AS HE SCOOTS OUT OF BOUNDS AT
[ct=297.832] THE 14 YARD LINE.
[ct=300.072] KIRK: WHAT A GREAT JOB OF
[ct=300.641] STEPPING UP.
[ct=302.680] WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE EDGE
[ct=302.917] PRESSURE.
[ct=305.802] WHEN YOU GET EDGE PRESSURE HERE
[ct=307.523] AND HERE, YOU HAVE TO STEP UP IN
[ct=307.997] THE POCKET.
[ct=311.347] HE CLIMBS AND DOES A GOOD JOB OF
[ct=312.459] PUTTING LEVI WALLACE IN A TOUGH
[ct=312.659] SPOT.
[ct=316.801] HE CAN STOP THE QUARTERBACK AND
[ct=317.013] GIVE UP THE THROW OR SIT IN
[ct=320.152] COVERAGE AND LET ZAPPE USE HIS
[ct=320.846] ATHLETIC ABILITY TO PICK UP THE
[ct=321.318] FIRST DOWN.
[ct=324.913] AL: GOT 11 ON A THIRD DOWN AND
[ct=325.724] 9.
[ct=328.579] BALL AT THE 14.
[ct=331.997] ELLIOTT AGAIN.
[ct=335.830] SHOWING SOME SHIFTING THIS.
[ct=339.043] TWO-TIME RUSHING CHAMPION.
[ct=341.538] SECOND DOWN.
[ct=344.158] KIRK: RHAMONDRE STEVENSON GOES
[ct=345.547] DOWN WITH A HIGH ANKLE.
[ct=347.025] TALKING TO BILL O’
[ct=347.572] TALKING TO BILL O'BRIEN THIS
[ct=349.915] WEEK, AT THIS STAGE OF HIS
[ct=353.864] CAREER, ELLIOTT MIGHT BE DOWN A
[ct=356.745] STEP OR TWO BUT HE WORKS HARD
[ct=358.308] DURING PRACTICE AND HAS A GREAT
[ct=358.592] ATTITUDE.
[ct=361.243] WE HAVE REALLY BEEN IMPRESSED
[ct=361.749] WITH WHAT HE HAS BROUGHT.
[ct=364.577] THE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO
[ct=365.900] GIVING HIM THE OPPORTUNITY TO
[ct=366.087] SEE WHAT HE CAN DO TONIGHT.
[ct=368.863] AL: PATRIOTS IN FOREIGN
[ct=368.863] TERRITORY.
[ct=371.737] THEY DID NOT GET INSIDE E
[ct=372.819] CHARGER 30 LAST WEEK.
[ct=377.528] FLOATS A PASS TO ZEKE, DIVES,
[ct=377.528] TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=380.503] I MEAN, GO FIGURE.
[ct=384.544] THEY PLAY 60 MINUTES AT HOME
[ct=385.624] LAST WEEK, DO NOT COME CLOSE TO
[ct=386.099] SCORING.
[ct=390.449] JUST LIKE THAT, OFF THE BAT, 75
[ct=391.707] YARDS IN A PLACE TO TAKE THE
[ct=392.007] LEAD.
[ct=395.056] KIRK: WITH THE INJURIES THE
[ct=396.195] STEELERS HAVE AT IT LINEBACKER,
[ct=396.643] THE BIG QUESTION
[ct=398.963] THESE LINEBACKERS DO AGAINST
[ct=401.865] TIGHT ANDS AND RUNNING BACKS?
[ct=403.282] A PICK.
[ct=407.269] IT ALLOWS FOR A NICE EASY READ
[ct=407.747] AND THROW FOR ZAPPE.
[ct=409.440] JUST LIKE THAT, THE PATRIOTS
[ct=411.851] LOOK GOOD ON THIS OPENING DRIVE.
[ct=416.348] AL: FOURTH ROUND PICK OUT OF
[ct=420.342] MARYLAND BOOTS THAT ONE THROUGH.
[ct=422.304] THAT ONE TOOK ONLY 3:48.
[ct=425.406] A STUNNING BEGINNING FOR THE NEW
[ct=427.648] ENGLAND PATRIOTS AND WHAT
[ct=428.578] FIGURES TO BE A LOW-SCORING
[ct=428.578] GAME.
[ct=429.239] 7-0.
[ct=432.391] HEADS ON PRIME
[ct=432.600] VIDEO.
[ct=436.406] -- HOLIDAY HITS ON PRIME VIDEO.
[ct=438.165] WATCH FAVORITES.
[ct=444.372] HOLIDAY HAPPY PLACE ON PRIME
[ct=448.151] MEANWHILE, THEY ARE STILL
[ct=448.151] WORKING ON WATT.
[ct=451.003] HE TOOK A SHOT AND CAME BACK
[ct=451.279] INTO THE GAME.
[ct=454.175] MEANWHILE, PITTSBURGH WILL GET
[ct=457.067] THE BALL AND GODWIN IGWEBUIKE
[ct=459.197] WILL TAKE THIS ONE BACK.
[ct=462.781] BREAKS A TACKLE AT THE 20 AND
[ct=465.947] GETS RUN DOWN AT THE 31 BY
[ct=465.947] JONATHAN JONES.
[ct=467.947] AND NOW MITCH TRUBISKY COMES IN.
[ct=470.413] NO STRANGER TO STARTING.
[ct=474.119] HE WAS WITH CHICAGO STARTING IN
[ct=474.370] 2017.
[ct=476.954] NUMBER 2 OVERALL PICK IN THE
[ct=477.186] DRAFT.
[ct=480.955] HE WAS GOING TO BE THE NEXT SID
[ct=484.360] LUCKMAN, SOMETHING CHICAGO HAS
[ct=486.190] BEEN LOOKING FOR FROM ABOUT THE
[ct=486.711] 17TH CENTURY.
[ct=490.990] HE HAD A GOOD ROOKIE YEAR AND A
[ct=492.811] GOOD SECOND YEAR, AND THEN HE
[ct=493.885] ENDED UP IN BUFFALO AND THEN
[ct=494.090] HERE LAST YEAR.
[ct=497.264] NAJEE HARRIS IS THE RUNNING
[ct=497.500] BACK.
[ct=498.600] PLAY ACTION.
[ct=500.760] GOOD PROTECTION.
[ct=502.122] NOW HE HAS TO SCRAMBLE.
[ct=503.446] HE CAN RUN!
[ct=506.057] TRUBISKY WILL PICK UP THE FIRST
[ct=508.743] DOWN ON HIS FIRST PLAY OF THE
[ct=513.762] AN OVERLOOKED PART OF HIS GAME,
[ct=515.494] THE FACT HE IS A DECENT RUNNER.
[ct=516.987] KIRK: HE REALLY IS.
[ct=519.053] HE BRINGS THAT ELEMENT.
[ct=521.646] WHEN COVERAGE IS GOOD, THE
[ct=525.198] LINEBACKERS SINK BACK IN
[ct=526.027] COVERAGE, HE MAKES A GOOD
[ct=528.641] DECISION TO PULL IT DOWN AND USE
[ct=530.457] HIS FEET AND GET THE FIRST DOWN.
[ct=532.368] HE WILL PLAY WELL BUT CAN HE
[ct=534.439] AVOID THAT CRITICAL MISTAKE?
[ct=538.413] PUTTING THE BALL INTO COVERAGE,
[ct=539.951] ESPECIALLY IN A GAME LIKE THIS
[ct=540.237] THAT YOU THINK WOULD BE
[ct=540.635] LOW-SCORING?
[ct=545.383] AL: AFTER A 15 YARD GAIN, THEY
[ct=547.432] GIVE IT TO THE RUNNING BACK,
[ct=548.828] HARRIS, WHO GETS OUT TO THE 47
[ct=549.001] YARD LINE.
[ct=552.763] KIRK: I THINK A BIG QUESTION
[ct=555.463] COMING INTO TONIGHT FOR MITCH IS
[ct=556.694] CAN THE RUNNING GAME GET THE
[ct=558.074] YARDS THEY NEED TO GET AGAINST
[ct=559.043] THIS DEFENSE OF THE PATRIOTS?
[ct=562.776] ONE THING THE GETS LOST IS HOW
[ct=563.403] WELL THEY HAVE PLAYED ON THAT
[ct=563.860] SIDE OF THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=565.889] THEY ARE TOUGH TO RUN THE BALL
[ct=566.179] AGAINST.
[ct=569.528] 3.2 YARDS PER CARRY, BEST IN THE
[ct=569.787] NFL.
[ct=573.450] FOR A PITTSBURGH TEAM THAT WANTS
[ct=574.356] TO ESTABLISH THE RUN, IT WILL BE
[ct=575.068] A TOUGH THING TO DO AGAINST THE
[ct=575.324] PATRIOTS.
[ct=578.208] AL: OVERALL, THEIR RUSHING
[ct=579.751] DEFENSE, FOURTH IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=583.027] KIRK JUST MENTIONED A VERY LOW
[ct=583.104] AVERAGE AGAIN.
[ct=585.215] THEY RELY ON THE FRONT AND THE
[ct=585.457] LINEBACKERS.
[ct=587.766] IT IS SECOND DOWN AND 9.
[ct=590.146] THEY WILL GET TO THE 50 YARD
[ct=590.885] LINE.
[ct=592.972] THAT WAS NAJEE HARRIS AGAIN.
[ct=595.199] IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND LET'S
[ct=596.663] CALL IT 6.
[ct=602.050] KIRK: THE DEFENSIVE LINEMEN,
[ct=604.299] ALLOWING THE LINEBACKERS TO GET
[ct=604.299] DOWNHILL.
[ct=606.330] THIS IS WHAT NEW ENGLAND WANTS
[ct=606.602] TO DO.
[ct=607.033] LET’
[ct=610.018] LET'S PUT TRUBISKY IN THESE
[ct=612.507] THIRD-AND-OBVIOUS SITUATIONS AND
[ct=614.221] THEN BILL BELICHICK AND THE
[ct=615.970] DEFENSIVE STAFF CAN GIVE THE
[ct=617.518] LOOKS THEY WANT TO TO CONFUSE
[ct=619.830] TRUBISKY TO SEE IF HE WILL THROW
[ct=620.257] IT INTO COVERAGE.
[ct=623.100] AL: JALEN MOORING COMING IN FOR
[ct=625.586] A THIRD DOWN AND 6 -- JAYLEN
[ct=627.431] WARREN COMING IN FOR A THIRD
[ct=627.966] DOWN AND 6.
[ct=632.422] TRUBISKY FIRES AND INTERCEPTED!
[ct=634.871] J.C. JACKSON.
[ct=636.429] A FLAG IS DOWN.
[ct=638.972] JACKSON LEFT, WENT TO THE
[ct=639.217] CHARGERS.
[ct=643.159] TRUBISKY SAID IT WILL BE A HOLD
[ct=643.725] ON NEW ENGLAND AND THAT APPEARS
[ct=644.029] TO BE THE HOLD.
[ct=648.507] REFEREE: PASS INTERFERENCE,
[ct=650.923] DEFENSE, NUMBER 29.
[ct=654.346] THIS IS A SPOT FOUL AND
[ct=654.775] AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
[ct=657.526] KIRK: IT IS HOW HE CAUGHT UP AND
[ct=658.065] WAS ABLE TO MAKE THE
[ct=658.323] INTERCEPTION.
[ct=661.767] PICKENS WAS GETTING AWAY FROM
[ct=664.501] HIM AND HE TRIED TO PULL A
[ct=665.861] VETERAN MOVE AND SEE IF HE COULD
[ct=665.861] GET AWAY WITH IT.
[ct=667.112] RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE.
[ct=668.898] NICE JOB OF CROSSING OVER.
[ct=671.655] MAKING THE DEFENSE HAVE TO
[ct=671.655] COMMUNICATE.
[ct=674.082] RIGHT THERE, HE GRABS ON.
[ct=678.810] REFEREE: THE BALL HAS BEEN MOVED
[ct=679.355] TO THE 39 YARD LINE.
[ct=689.108] AL: THAT IS AN 11 YARD PENALTY.
[ct=693.117] FIRST FLAG OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=696.501] COMING OFF LAST WEEK, THAT IS A
[ct=699.000] TREAT, SIX MINUTES INTO THE
[ct=702.303] TRUBISKY, CAN’
[ct=703.697] TRUBISKY, CAN'T AND THEN SPUN
[ct=706.020] OUT OF BOUNDS IS GEORGE PICKENS.
[ct=709.360] JONATHAN JONES COVERING ON THE
[ct=712.776] KIRK: THIS IS THE THIRD GAME
[ct=714.643] THEY MADE THIS MOVE WITH MATT
[ct=715.164] CANADA BEING LET GO IN THE
[ct=715.673] MIDDLE OF THE YEAR.
[ct=718.304] EDDIE FAULKNER TAKES OVER AS THE
[ct=719.641] INTERIM OC.
[ct=725.502] ON THE LEFT IS THE PLAY CALLER.
[ct=728.618] HE CALLED PLAYS WITH THE NEW
[ct=730.018] YORK GIANTS.
[ct=732.290] THAT EXPERIENCE PUTS HIM IN THE
[ct=734.336] MIDDLE TO TRY TO RUN A CLEAN
[ct=734.336] OPERATION.
[ct=743.460] AL: ROBINSON SETS UP ON THE
[ct=743.734] RIGHT SIDE.
[ct=744.863] TOSS.
[ct=745.871] WARREN.
[ct=747.149] NOTHING.
[ct=751.831] JENNINGS IS RIGHT THERE TO STOP
[ct=752.779] HIM IN HIS TRACKS.
[ct=760.546] KIRK: WITH JUDON GOING DOWN,
[ct=761.920] JENNINGS WENT FROM BEING A ROLE
[ct=763.187] PLAYER TO A FEATURE PLAYER.
[ct=766.006] LOOK AT HOW HE USES HIS HANDS
[ct=766.969] AND THROWS HIM.
[ct=771.973] JENNINGS IS A GUY WHO SETS THE
[ct=773.369] EDGE AND HE CAN PROVIDE SOME
[ct=773.369] PASS RUSH.
[ct=776.873] HE IS EXCELLING IN HIS FOURTH
[ct=777.371] YEAR OUT OF ALABAMA.
[ct=782.891] AL: JUDON IS PROBABLY THEIR BEST
[ct=784.719] DEFENSIVE PLAYER, TORN BICEPS,
[ct=786.044] GONE FOR THE SEASON.
[ct=789.104] LOW SNAP, HANDLES IT.
[ct=791.434] HE WILL TAKE OFF AND GO NOWHERE.
[ct=793.253] STOPPED AT THE LINE OF
[ct=793.509] SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=796.933] TACKLE MADE BY MACK WILSON SR..
[ct=800.894] KIRK: REMEMBER THE FIRST PLAY OF
[ct=802.031] THE GAME, HE STEPPED UP AND
[ct=802.877] PICKED UP YARDS.
[ct=806.348] THIS TIME, MACK WILSON ALMOST
[ct=806.920] ANTICIPATING THE POTENTIAL
[ct=807.135] THREAT.
[ct=809.139] EVEN THOUGH HE RUSHED OFF THE
[ct=811.968] EDGE, TO ME, HE IS ALMOST USED
[ct=812.984] AS A SPY.
[ct=815.269] NOW I WILL GET UNDERNEATH.
[ct=818.765] ALMOST BAITED HIM TO STEP UP.
[ct=821.697] AL: THAT MEANS CHRIS BOSWELL,
[ct=824.728] NINTH YEAR WITH THE STEELERS,
[ct=826.587] SIGNED AS A FREE AGENT OUT OF
[ct=829.877] RICE IN 2015.
[ct=832.578] 56 YARD ATTEMPT AND BOSWELL
[ct=835.316] BANGS THAT ONE THROUGH.
[ct=846.212] AL: T.J. WATT, A ROUGH OPENING
[ct=846.212] SALVO.
[ct=849.471] KIRK: FIRST PLAY OF THE GAME,
[ct=852.372] LOOK AT THAT, KNEE TO THE FACE.
[ct=855.736] THAT IS A LOT OF IMPACT THAT HE
[ct=855.975] ENDURES.
[ct=859.612] AND THEN HE TAKES A HEEL FROM
[ct=861.033] ZEKE ELLIOTT IN THE FACE.
[ct=863.088] A ROUGH FIRST DRIVE.
[ct=866.839] NOT ONLY 7 POINTS, BUT YOUR STAR
[ct=868.065] PLAYER GETS SOME SHOTS.
[ct=872.241] AL: MILESTONE NIGHT FOR HIM,
[ct=873.109] PLAYING IN HIS 100TH GAME.
[ct=880.200] T.J. WATT THROUGH 100 GAMES,
[ct=883.162] MIKE TOMLIN CALLING HIM THE BEST
[ct=884.082] DEFENSIVE PLAYER ON THE PLANET.
[ct=891.533] 91.5 SACKS, RECOVERED 10
[ct=895.685] FUMBLES, SEVEN PICKS AND HE IS
[ct=897.015] IN A GROUP OF ONLY THREE, JARED
[ct=901.248] ALLEN AND HIS BROTHER.
[ct=905.261] KIRK: SINCE HIS DAYS AT
[ct=906.407] WISCONSIN, THE PASSION AND
[ct=909.075] ENERGY HE PLAYS WITH EVERY
[ct=910.347] SINGLE DOWN, EVERY SINGLE WEEK.
[ct=912.018] AL: ZAPPE RETREATS.
[ct=916.040] ZAPPE THROWS DOWNFIELD INTO
[ct=916.040] DOUBLE COVERAGE AND THAT IS
[ct=918.588] INCOMPLETE, INTENDED FOR TYQUAN
[ct=918.861] THORNTON.
[ct=921.656] KAYLEE: WHILE PITTSBURGH'S
[ct=923.146] DEFENSE WAS ON THE SIDELINES,
[ct=924.933] T.J. WATT WAS ATTENDED TO.
[ct=928.983] A DOCTOR ACTUALLY REACHED INSIDE
[ct=931.676] HIS MOUTH AND EVALUATED THAT JAW
[ct=932.785] JOINT.
[ct=935.487] NO OTHER ATTENTION WAS PAID TO
[ct=935.901] HIM AFTER THAT.
[ct=938.238] AL: YOU COULD SEE HIM GOING
[ct=939.861] THROUGH THAT RIGHT THERE ON THE
[ct=940.178] BENCH.
[ct=942.853] NUMBER 90.
[ct=947.920] RAIN, SNOW, NOTHING WILL KEEP
[ct=949.431] HIM FROM HIS APPOINTED ROUNDS.
[ct=952.770] SPEAKING OF THE WEATHER, IT IS
[ct=952.770] 45 DEGREES.
[ct=954.131] VERY NICE.
[ct=956.835] UP THE MIDDLE, ZEKE ELLIOTT
[ct=958.100] PICKS UP 3.
[ct=960.104] THIRD DOWN AND 7.
[ct=962.748] KIRK: T.J. WATT HAS BEEN
[ct=963.784] CHALLENGED THROUGHOUT HIS
[ct=964.507] CAREER.
[ct=966.908] I LOVE THAT HE IS ABLE TO DEFEND
[ct=967.144] THE RUN.
[ct=969.870] HE IS NOT JUST ABOUT BEING A
[ct=971.578] PASS RUSHER.
[ct=973.137] I THINK HE TAKES A LOT OF PRIDE
[ct=973.654] IN BEING A COMPLETE PLAYER.
[ct=976.376] HE WORKS AT HIS GAME 12 MONTHS
[ct=976.574] OUT OF THE YEAR.
[ct=980.116] WE ALL GET EXCITED FOR THESE
[ct=980.670] OPPORTUNITIES ON THIRD DOWN.
[ct=984.241] IF YOU STUDY HIM, IT IS IN
[ct=985.186] EVERYTHING DOWN THING FOR NUMBER
[ct=985.186] 90.
[ct=987.916] AL: SIX MINUTES LEFT IN THE
[ct=988.451] OPENING QUARTER.
[ct=993.365] ZAPPE, DOWNFIELD, IT WILL BE
[ct=994.677] CAUGHT OUTSIDE THE 40 YARD LINE
[ct=996.718] AND THEN A FLAG COMES IN AT THE
[ct=997.049] END OF THE PLAY.
[ct=999.013] HUNTER HENRY, THE TIGHT END.
[ct=1001.658] THE STEELERS INDICATING IT IS
[ct=1002.208] AGAINST THE PATRIOTS.
[ct=1007.880] OFFENSE, NUMBER 85.
[ct=1010.233] 10 YARD PENALTY FROM THE
[ct=1012.411] PREVIOUS SPOT, THIRD DOWN.
[ct=1015.093] AL: THAT IS HOW HUNTER GOT FREE.
[ct=1017.548] KIRK: AT THE TOP OF THE ROUTE,
[ct=1017.714] HE PUSHED OFF.
[ct=1019.437] I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT ZAPPE
[ct=1021.752] SITTING IN THERE ON A THIRD AND
[ct=1021.783] LONG.
[ct=1023.560] THE PUSH IS RIGHT THERE.
[ct=1025.453] GOOD CALL BY THE OFFICIAL.
[ct=1027.510] THAT IS HOW
[ct=1028.887] SEPARATING AND GETTING OPEN.
[ct=1030.885] AL: THIRD DOWN AND 17.
[ct=1033.781] BELICHICK ARGUING THE CALL.
[ct=1041.810] THEY HAVE TO GET TO THE 35.
[ct=1044.131] THROWS UNDERNEATH.
[ct=1048.365] ELLIOTT HAS A BLOCKER AND THE
[ct=1049.122] DEFENSE CLOSES QUICKLY ON HIM.
[ct=1052.080] MINKAH FITZPATRICK IS THERE AND
[ct=1054.389] THE PATRIOTS SCENTED IN THE PUNT
[ct=1054.389] UNIT.
[ct=1057.381] KIRK: IF YOU ARE A PATRIOTS FAN,
[ct=1058.594] THAT IS WHAT HAS BOTHERED YOU
[ct=1060.123] THE MOST, THE MISCUES.
[ct=1062.594] THE RED ZONE HAS BEEN A PROBLEM
[ct=1065.317] AND TURNOVERS.
[ct=1066.666] INTERCEPTIONS AND PENALTIES THAT
[ct=1068.002] GET YOU BEHIND THE STICKS.
[ct=1072.693] AL: BRYCE BERINGER, A ROOKIE OUT
[ct=1075.726] OF MICHIGAN STATE IS THE PUNTER.
[ct=1080.772] CALVIN AUSTIN BACK TO ACCEPT IT
[ct=1080.772] AT HIS 25 YARD LINE.
[ct=1083.432] BACKING UP A LITTLE BIT.
[ct=1085.805] CATCHES THE BALL AT THE 17.
[ct=1089.030] NOWHERE TO ROAM.
[ct=1094.953] STOP AT THE 21 YARD T.J. WATT JU
[ct=1096.515] BLUE MEDICAL TENT.
[ct=1101.090] WE WILL GET A REPORT ON THAT.
[ct=1106.554] MEANWHILE, IN TERMS OF INJURIES,
[ct=1109.879] THERE IS KENNY PICKETT.
[ct=1114.301] HE IS OUT FOR TWO TO FOUR WEEKS.
[ct=1117.691] THE STEELERS HAVE A QUESTION
[ct=1118.989] THEY NEED TO BE ANSWERED.
[ct=1119.793] IS HE THE FUTURE?
[ct=1122.861] HE HAD ANKLE SURGERY THIS WEEK.
[ct=1125.411] WE WILL GET WORD ON THAT WHEN WE
[ct=1125.662] COME BACK.
[ct=1128.262] IS HE THE GUY FOR THE FUTURE?
[ct=1130.364] WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.
[ct=1132.956] STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS TO BE
[ct=1133.140] ANSWERED.
[ct=1136.906] TRUBISKY BACK TO PASS, THROWS
[ct=1138.582] AND IS DROPPED AT THE 26 YARD
[ct=1142.591] KAYLEE: LESS THAN 24 HOURS AFTER
[ct=1145.396] PICKETT LIMPED OFF THE FIELD
[ct=1146.500] WITH A SPRAINED RIGHT ANKLE, HE
[ct=1148.690] WAS IN SURGERY ON MONDAY.
[ct=1154.877] HOLES ARE DRILLED INTO THE TWO
[ct=1156.418] BONES OF THE LOWER LEG AND
[ct=1159.154] SUTURES PULLED THE BONES
[ct=1160.170] TOGETHER AND STABILIZE THE
[ct=1161.591] INJURED LOWER SHIN.
[ct=1165.472] PICKETT HAD THE SAME PROCEDURE
[ct=1166.116] DONE ON HIS LEFT ANKLE IN
[ct=1169.423] COLLEGE AND HE RETURNED TO PLAY
[ct=1169.695] 26 DAYS LATER.
[ct=1174.455] AL: THANK YOU, DR. HARTUNG.
[ct=1176.730] YOU ARE GETTING VERY GOOD AT
[ct=1177.169] THOSE ANIMATIONS.
[ct=1178.735] SECOND DOWN AND 10.
[ct=1180.536] HERE IS HARRIS.
[ct=1183.692] THEY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF HE IS
[ct=1184.208] THE GUY FOR THE FUTURE.
[ct=1186.578] THEY PICKED HIM IN THE FIRST
[ct=1186.861] ROUND LAST YEAR.
[ct=1188.883] OFF AND ON THIS YEAR, NOTHING
[ct=1189.101] GREAT.
[ct=1191.964] LOOKING AHEAD TO NEXT YEAR, WHAT
[ct=1192.870] ARE YOU THINKING?
[ct=1195.390] KIRK: THAT IS THE BIG DECISION
[ct=1195.879] THEY WILL HAVE TO MAKE.
[ct=1197.737] SECOND YEAR OUT OF PITT.
[ct=1201.785] MATT CANADA TOOK A LOTTO BLAME
[ct=1202.509] FOR THE OFFENSIVE STRUGGLES.
[ct=1205.184] CAN PICKETT BE THE GUY?
[ct=1209.200] YOU LOOK AT THE RECEIVERS, THE
[ct=1211.269] TIGHT END, THE RUNNING BACKS,
[ct=1212.628] ALL YOU NEED IS CONSISTENCY FROM
[ct=1214.883] THE QUARTERBACK POSITION AND
[ct=1215.284] THIS OFFENSE COULD BE UP TO THE
[ct=1217.585] LEVEL YOU EXPECTED TO BE.
[ct=1218.927] AL: THIRD AND 6.
[ct=1221.745] TRUBISKY GOING DEEP DOWNFIELD
[ct=1223.221] AND TOO DEEP.
[ct=1225.120] INTENDED FOR ALLEN ROBINSON.
[ct=1227.510] QUICKLY, THREE AND OUT.
[ct=1229.389] KIRK: THAT IS WHAT THEY WILL
[ct=1230.686] HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IN THE
[ct=1234.844] IS KENNY PICKETT THE GUY WHO CAN
[ct=1237.226] GIVE YOU THE CONSISTENCY THAT
[ct=1237.575] THIS OFFENSE NEEDS?
[ct=1240.156] ONLY THEY KNOW THAT DECISION.
[ct=1244.884] AL: WHEN YOU FLIP IT AROUND,
[ct=1245.073] WITH NEW ENGLAND, IT IS ALMOST
[ct=1247.607] THE SAME THING WITH MAC JONES,
[ct=1249.211] EVEN THOUGH JONES HAS BEEN IN
[ct=1250.576] THE LEAGUE A YEAR LONGER.
[ct=1254.118] WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THEIR FUTURE
[ct=1254.118] AT QUARTERBACK?
[ct=1255.883] KIRK: THAT IS A BIG ONE.
[ct=1257.860] I DO NOT THINK THEY HAVE THE
[ct=1260.225] WEAPONS AROUND THAT POSITION
[ct=1260.489] LIKE THIS FOR DOES.
[ct=1263.236] AL: FAIR CATCH MADE BY MYLES
[ct=1265.916] BRYANT, OFF THE FOOT OF PRESSLEY
[ct=1266.163] HARVIN.
[ct=1267.825] A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT ZAPPE.
[ct=1272.562] HE WAS A NOTHING, NO-STAR
[ct=1272.562] RECRUIT.
[ct=1275.488] ATTENDED HOUSTON BAPTIST
[ct=1278.040] UNIVERSITY FOR THREE YEARS AND
[ct=1278.553] THEN TRANSFERRED TO WESTERN
[ct=1280.159] KENTUCKY WITH ONE OF HIS COACHES
[ct=1282.149] AND SET THE ALL-TIME SINGLE
[ct=1287.414] SEASON YARDAGE IN -- ALL-TIME
[ct=1288.201] SINGLE SEASON PASSING YARDAGE
[ct=1288.201] RECORD.
[ct=1290.385] MAKING HIS FOURTH CAREER START
[ct=1290.691] TONIGHT.
[ct=1294.831] KIRK: HE HAS NO PROBLEM BEING
[ct=1296.246] ABLE TO EVALUATE COVERAGE, MAKE
[ct=1296.459] THROWS.
[ct=1299.689] I THINK IT IS MORE ABOUT BEING
[ct=1299.950] DECISIVE TONIGHT.
[ct=1303.392] QUARTERBACKS WHO HAVE HAD A LOT
[ct=1305.869] OF GAMES UNDER THEIR BELT, IT IS
[ct=1306.340] A LOT EASY TO PROCESS THE
[ct=1306.595] INFORMATION.
[ct=1309.906] WITH A YOUNG GUY LIKE THIS, THEY
[ct=1311.191] ARE TRYING TO SIMPLIFY IT AND
[ct=1311.643] GET IT OUT QUICK.
[ct=1314.610] AL: A CATCH IS MADE BY TYQUAN
[ct=1317.022] THORNTON, SECOND YEAR RECEIVER
[ct=1317.242] OUT OF BAYLOR.
[ct=1320.723] KIRK: I THINK WHAT THEY ARE
[ct=1322.308] TRYING TO DO, BILL O'BRIEN
[ct=1324.129] TRYING TO GO BACK TO THAT FIRST
[ct=1324.411] POSSESSION WHERE THEY JUST WENT
[ct=1325.099] DOWN THE FIELD.
[ct=1327.223] A LOT OF THROWS WERE ON EARLY
[ct=1327.223] DOWNS.
[ct=1329.248] THEY GOT HIM INTO A RHYTHM.
[ct=1332.908] THAT WAS THEIR FIRST TOUCHDOWN
[ct=1333.938] ON AN OPENING DRIVE OF THE
[ct=1334.759] ENTIRE SEASON AND THEY EXECUTED
[ct=1335.259] PERFECTLY.
[ct=1341.087] AL: WATT OUT OF THE TENT,
[ct=1342.357] LOOKING LIKE HE IS READY TO COME
[ct=1342.357] BACK IN.
[ct=1346.207] FIRST DOWN AT THE 38 YARD LINE.
[ct=1348.784] PLAY-ACTION.
[ct=1353.868] ESCAPES THE SACK, FIRES AND THAT
[ct=1357.279] WILL BE HAULED IN AT THE 46 YARD
[ct=1358.848] LINE BY JUJU SMITH-SCHUSTER.
[ct=1360.226] ALEX HIGHSMITH WITH THE PRESSURE
[ct=1363.148] ON ZAPPE, WHO IS ABLE TO GET
[ct=1363.685] AWAY AND FIND HIS MEN.
[ct=1366.961] KIRK: HERE IS HIGHSMITH AND HERE
[ct=1367.077] IS CONNOR MCDERMOTT.
[ct=1369.637] LOOK AT HIM CLIMB.
[ct=1370.513] HE FELT THE PRESSURE.
[ct=1372.202] THAT IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
[ct=1375.530] ABILITY TO KEEP HIS VISION
[ct=1376.455] DOWNFIELD DESPITE ALL THE NOISE
[ct=1377.166] AROUND HIM.
[ct=1380.838] THAT IS THE EXPERIENCE AND WHAT
[ct=1381.770] HE SHOWED AT WESTERN KENTUCKY
[ct=1383.684] FOR THAT ONE YEAR, THE ABILITY
[ct=1384.997] TO THROW THE BALL DOWNFIELD.
[ct=1389.303] WATT OUT, HIGHSMITH APPLIES THE
[ct=1389.868] PRESSURE AND CONNOR MCDERMOTT
[ct=1391.872] DOES JUST ENOUGH TO ALLOW HIM TO
[ct=1392.212] STEP UP.
[ct=1397.068] AL: MEANWHILE, ZAPPE, MOVING
[ct=1399.386] OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=1402.037] ELLIOTT WAS THE INTENDED
[ct=1404.296] RECEIVER BUT JUST THROWING IT
[ct=1404.296] AWAY TO AVOID THE SACK.
[ct=1410.035] AL: DOESN'T THIS GAME FEEL LIKE
[ct=1412.038] WITH THESE QUARTERBACKS -- IT IS
[ct=1413.907] ONE THING TO BE EFFICIENT, WHICH
[ct=1415.943] GUY WILL AVOID THAT CRITICAL
[ct=1417.309] ERROR?
[ct=1421.166] A PICK SIX OR A SACK AND
[ct=1421.558] FUMBLE?
[ct=1423.906] IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT BEING
[ct=1423.969] EFFICIENT.
[ct=1427.467] JUST AVOID THE PLAY THAT COSTS
[ct=1427.809] YOU THE GAME.
[ct=1430.232] AL: TRUBISKY HAS SPENT HIS
[ct=1432.446] ENTIRE CAREER AVOIDING A PICK
[ct=1432.765] SIX.
[ct=1435.054] WATT IS BACK IN.
[ct=1438.131] THAT PASS IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=1440.347] A LITTLE BIT BEHIND JALEN
[ct=1444.893] REGULAR, FORMER NUMBER 1 PICK BY
[ct=1444.893] PHILADELPHIA.
[ct=1449.998] KIRK: TOM BRADY DID THIS A
[ct=1450.337] MILLION TIMES.
[ct=1454.069] FORGET ABOUT IT, IT IS A NICE
[ct=1454.069] COMPLETION.
[ct=1457.574] JUST MISSING THAT BY SIX INCHES
[ct=1459.081] BEHIND THE RECEIVER IS THE
[ct=1461.015] DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CATCH AND
[ct=1464.548] YARDS AFTER THE CATCH AND
[ct=1466.894] INCOMPLETION AND NOW THIRD
[ct=1468.418] 10.
[ct=1471.011] AL: 2:20 TO GO IN THE QUARTER.
[ct=1475.407] PAST SCORED -- PATS SCORED ON
[ct=1476.708] THEIR OPENING DRIVE AND LEAD
[ct=1478.343] 7-3.
[ct=1479.264] THAT IS INCOMPLETE.
[ct=1481.709] INTENDED FOR SMITH-SCHUSTER.
[ct=1485.019] YOU HAD JOEY PORTER JR., THE
[ct=1489.329] ROOKIE, COVERING ON THE PLAY,
[ct=1489.329] OUT OF PENN STATE.
[ct=1490.711] FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=1493.553] KIRK: I REALLY THOUGHT HE WAS
[ct=1495.749] THROWING THE BALL TO HENRY, 85.
[ct=1498.421] HE GETS AWAY WITH A POTENTIAL
[ct=1499.630] PUSH OFF AT THE TOP OF HIS
[ct=1499.978] ROUTE.
[ct=1501.733] I REALLY THOUGHT THEY WOULD
[ct=1502.407] THROW TO HIM.
[ct=1504.083] WATCH HENRY PUSH OFF.
[ct=1507.993] THE BALL GOES OVER HIS HEAD AND
[ct=1508.604] IS ALMOST INTERCEPTED.
[ct=1512.236] AL: COULD HAVE CALLED HENRY
[ct=1514.890] AGAIN, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS
[ct=1516.891] SECOND OFFENSIVE P.I.
[ct=1521.371] THE PUNT FIELDED AT THE TENT AND
[ct=1522.735] RUN BACK TO THE 15 YARD LINE BY
[ct=1523.303] CALVIN AUSTIN.
[ct=1527.942] ACRISURE STADIUM, PITTSBURGH,
[ct=1532.708] PA, 7 SO, AS WE COME BACK TO
[ct=1535.933] PITTSBURGH, WE WILL HEAD WEST TO
[ct=1540.026] VEGAS AS THE RAIDERS MEET
[ct=1542.751] CHARGERS ON THURSDAY NIGHT
[ct=1545.933] BOTH TEAMS TRYING TO STAY ALIVE.
[ct=1548.657] THE CHARGERS COMING OFF A SHOT
[ct=1549.993] OUT WIN AT NEW ENGLAND.
[ct=1553.199] THE RAIDERS ARE ALSO 5-7.
[ct=1555.857] KIRK: EVERY SINGLE GAME COMING
[ct=1557.928] DOWN THE STRETCH WITH THE
[ct=1559.276] PLAYOFF PICTURE, YOU LOOK AT ALL
[ct=1560.647] THE TEAMS THAT ARE
[ct=1560.851] MATHEMATICALLY ALIVE.
[ct=1562.481] EVERY GAME MATTERS.
[ct=1564.596] THAT WILL BE A GOOD ONE NEXT
[ct=1564.596] WEEK.
[ct=1567.244] AL: TRUBISKY OUT OF THE PISTOL.
[ct=1569.055] TOSS HERE.
[ct=1570.715] HARRIS.
[ct=1576.460] NAJEE PICKS UP 4, GETS TO THE 19
[ct=1578.543] JENNINGS MAKING THE TACKLE.
[ct=1581.152] KIRK: THIS DEFENSE HAS DONE IT
[ct=1581.851] ALL YEAR.
[ct=1586.789] WHAT IS CRAZY, 1-3, ALLOWING 10
[ct=1587.328] OR FEWER POINTS.
[ct=1592.163] THE REST OF THE ENTIRE NFL IS
[ct=1593.759] 53-0 WHEN THEY ALLOW 10 POINTS
[ct=1594.054] OR FEWER.
[ct=1598.922] THIS PATRIOTS DEFENSE, 1-3.
[ct=1609.953] AL: TRUBISKY.
[ct=1615.304] SECONDHAND 6 -- SECOND AND 6.
[ct=1620.385] PICKING UP THE FIRST DOWN,
[ct=1621.747] JAYLEN WARREN.
[ct=1623.247] THE CROWD LIKES IT.
[ct=1626.789] THEY HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH
[ct=1642.905] JAYLEN WARREN OUT OF OKLAHOMA
[ct=1643.161] STATE, UNDRAFTED FREE AGENT.
[ct=1647.425] KIRK: HE WAS ONE OF THE BEST IN
[ct=1647.720] THE ENTIRE
[ct=1649.683] DEFENDERS MISS.
[ct=1651.611] AL: WARREN STAYS IN.
[ct=1654.079] HE IS THE MOTION MAN.
[ct=1657.089] NAJEE CAN BARELY GET OUT OF THE
[ct=1657.391] BACKFIELD.
[ct=1659.738] JALEN MILLS MAKING THE TACKLE.
[ct=1662.678] KIRK: PATRIOTS JUST KEEP FILING
[ct=1666.508] GUYS IN -- SAFETIES,
[ct=1670.161] INTERCHANGEABLE PARTS THAT CAN
[ct=1671.157] DO SO MANY PARTS OF THIS
[ct=1671.157] DEFENSE.
[ct=1675.907] PAMPERS, SOMETIMES -- PEPPERS,
[ct=1679.487] SOMETIMES HE IS A SAFETY,
[ct=1680.108] SOMETIMES A LINEBACKER.
[ct=1684.684] THESE PLAYERS CAN DO SO MANY
[ct=1687.282] DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS DEFENSE.
[ct=1691.179] AL: IT HAS BEEN A BELICHICK
[ct=1691.708] TRADEMARK FOR A QUARTER CENTURY.
[ct=1693.589] KEEP THEM GUESSING.
[ct=1696.278] SECOND AND 11.
[ct=1698.597] THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE END OF
[ct=1698.861] THE QUARTER.
[ct=1703.669] WE HAVEAL: AL MICHAELS WITH KIRK
[ct=1703.669] HERBSTREIT, KAYLEE HARTUNG.
[ct=1707.184] THERE IS BILL BELICHICK COACHING
[ct=1709.063] UP THE OFFENSE, ZAPPE AND
[ct=1712.398] CHECKING OUT THE SCREEN.
[ct=1715.142] RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE ON DEFENSE
[ct=1717.334] AS WE ENTER THE SECOND FRAME.
[ct=1722.023] PITTSBURGH WITH A THIRD DOWN AND
[ct=1722.987] 10 AT THEIR OWN 27 YARD LINE.
[ct=1727.316] THEY WILL GO FIVE WIDE.
[ct=1733.035] NOW WARREN COMES INTO THE
[ct=1742.015] TRUBISKY, UNDER PRESSURE, FIRES,
[ct=1744.028] IT IS INTERCEPTED INSIDE THE 40!
[ct=1747.494] JABRILL PEPPERS, DOWN THE
[ct=1747.824] SIDELINE.
[ct=1750.525] THAT WILL SET UP A FIRST DOWN AT
[ct=1751.172] THE 11 YARD LINE.
[ct=1761.347] THE BOOS RAIN DOWN.
[ct=1764.249] KIRK: THIS IS TEXTBOOK FOR WHAT
[ct=1766.348] NEW ENGLAND'S PLAN WAS AGAINST
[ct=1766.608] TRUBISKY.
[ct=1769.715] SHOW HIM A PRE-SNAP LOOK.
[ct=1773.524] WATCH ALL THE MOVEMENT FROM THE
[ct=1773.825] TIME THE BALL IS SNAPPED.
[ct=1777.442] DUGGAR ANN'S UPCOMING ON THE
[ct=1777.442] BLITZ.
[ct=1781.147] NOW THE LINEBACKERS DROP IN
[ct=1781.147] COVERAGE.
[ct=1786.425] PEPPERS BAITED HIM, THE ENTIRE
[ct=1790.352] DEFENSE, STEVE BELICHICK DIALS
[ct=1791.924] IT UP PERFECTLY.
[ct=1794.553] THEY BRING PRESSURE FROM HIS
[ct=1795.300] RIGHT AND DRAW FROM THE LEFT.
[ct=1797.845] THAT HAS BEEN HIS ACHILLES'
[ct=1800.499] HEEL, IDENTIFYING THAT AND
[ct=1802.933] AVOIDING THE DISASTROUS PLAY.
[ct=1806.313] AL: THE PATS AT THE 11 YARD
[ct=1809.512] A CHANCE TO EXTEND THEIR LEAD.
[ct=1815.539] WE ALMOST GAVE TRUBISKY -- I
[ct=1817.095] MENTIONED HE HAD NEVER THROWN A
[ct=1820.861] PICK SIX IN 1819 CAREER PASSES.
[ct=1826.668] AT LEAST PEPPERS GOT TACKLED AT
[ct=1826.668] THE 11 YARD LINE TO SAVE HIM.
[ct=1829.350] KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE HIGHSMITH IS
[ct=1829.693] DOWN.
[ct=1833.585] WE SAW WATT DEALING WITH SOME
[ct=1834.231] INJURIES AND HE CAME BACK.
[ct=1836.038] ON THE OTHER SIDE IS ALEX
[ct=1836.220] HIGHSMITH.
[ct=1840.523] KEEP IN MIND, MARKUS GOLDEN IS
[ct=1841.023] NOT UP TONIGHT.
[ct=1848.500] YOU HAVE NATE HERBIG BEHIND EACH
[ct=1849.213] OF THESE OUTSIDE LINEBACKERS.
[ct=1853.515] AL: MIKE TOMLIN COMING OUT TO
[ct=1855.131] TAKE A FIRSTHAND LOOK.
[ct=1861.206] AND AN INJURY TIMEOUT.
[ct=1862.287] RUDOLPH."
[ct=1865.042] THEY KNOW HIM.
[ct=1866.454] HE HAS HAD DECENT MOMENTS.
[ct=1868.238] SIXTH YEAR.
[ct=1869.989] THEY ARE ABOUT READY TO SEE HIM
[ct=1870.941] COME IN AGAIN, BUT NOT AT THE
[ct=1871.540] MOMENT.
[ct=1874.125] SECOND DOWN AND 7.
[ct=1880.206] PATRIOTS, TO THE END ZONE,
[ct=1881.206] TOUCHDOWN BY HUNTER HENRY!
[ct=1888.188] SO THE PATRIOTS BLANKED LAST
[ct=1892.375] WEEK, BLINKED TWICE AT HOME THIS
[ct=1893.060] YEAR, LIVING IN SINGLE DIGIT
[ct=1895.748] THEY PUT UP A COUPLE OF
[ct=1895.965] TOUCHDOWNS TONIGHT.
[ct=1900.440] KIRK: VERY DIFFERENT LOOKING
[ct=1900.706] OFFENSE TONIGHT.
[ct=1901.399] MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE.
[ct=1903.322] DAILY, -- BAILEY ZAPPE
[ct=1906.134] HUGE.
[ct=1906.335] THE INTERCEPTION TO
[ct=1908.957] HIM UP.
[ct=1910.962] WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE
[ct=1912.999] MYKAL WALKER ENDS UP SLIPPING AT
[ct=1914.277] THE TOP OF THE ROUTES, AND THEY
[ct=1915.650] THREW RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF
[ct=1916.241] THIS DEFENSE.
[ct=1917.407] THAT IS WHERE YOU THOUGHT THEY
[ct=1918.805] WOULD ATTACK AGAINST THESE
[ct=1920.043] LINEBACKERS BETWEEN THE
[ct=1920.496] SAFETIES, AND THEY HIT ONE FOR A
[ct=1923.838] AL: RYLAND FOR THE POINT AFTER.
[ct=1928.020] AND SECONDS INTO THE SECOND
[ct=1934.213] QUARTER, THE PATRIOTS, TWO AND
[ct=1935.541] 10, LEAD THE STEELERS 7-5,
[ct=1938.750] 14-3.
[ct=1942.868] KIRK: HENRY WAS CLOSE TO MAKING
[ct=1944.438] SOME BIG PLAYS, CAPITALIZES ON
[ct=1944.722] THE RED ZONE.
[ct=1945.364] LET'S LOOK AT THIS DEFENSIVE
[ct=1948.245] ALERT AMAZON LIKES TO LOOK AT.
[ct=1950.209] THE RED SHOWS YOU THE POTENTIAL
[ct=1951.653] PEPPERS IS AT THE TOP.
[ct=1952.588] SNAP OF THE BALL.
[ct=1953.512] YOU SEE THE MOVEMENT.
[ct=1956.661] THEY WANTED TO SEE IT FROM THE
[ct=1957.699] PRE-SNAP, WHERE HE THINGS HE HAS
[ct=1958.782] AN IDEA WHERE TO GO TO THE BALL,
[ct=1961.457] AND THEN YOU MOVE AND IT AFFECTS
[ct=1962.767] HIS VISION.
[ct=1963.787] PEPPERS IS THE BENEFICIARY.
[ct=1965.302] GETS THE BALL BACK TO BAILEY
[ct=1966.646] ZAPPE HE AND A BIG TOUCHDOWN
[ct=1968.043] THROW UP HIGH IN THE AIR WHERE
[ct=1969.075] THE TIGHT ENDS COME DOWN WITH
[ct=1969.075] IT.
[ct=1972.451] ZAPPE IS OFTEN A GREAT START
[ct=1972.790] WITH THIS PATRIOTS OFFENSE.
[ct=1975.505] AL: WE WERE TALKING ON THE CALL
[ct=1977.260] THE OTHER DAY, WE SAID, WHO WAS
[ct=1980.372] YOUR SUPPORT SYSTEM?
[ct=1983.953] IT IS TOUGH, YOU ARE IN A NEW
[ct=1986.181] ENGLAND AND ALL OF THAT, AND HIS
[ct=1990.479] FIANCÉE, AND DO YOU AT LEAST
[ct=1990.789] LOVE YOUR JOB?
[ct=1991.836] YEAH.
[ct=1995.002] KIRK: SHE IS NOT PATTING HIM ON
[ct=1995.732] THE BACK BUT SAYING, DO YOUR
[ct=1995.732] JOB.
[ct=2000.050] AL: THE BELICHICK MANTRA.
[ct=2002.262] ALMOST ALL OF HIS CARRIER.
[ct=2005.572] KIRK: SHE WAS AN ATHLETE
[ct=2008.179] HERSELF, SO YOU CANNOT CRY ON
[ct=2008.487] HER SHOULDER.
[ct=2012.402] AL: THE PATRIOTS HAVE SCORED 13
[ct=2012.974] TOTAL POINTS THEIR LAST THREE
[ct=2013.205] GAMES.
[ct=2016.363] THEY HAVE EXCEEDED THAT TONIGHT
[ct=2017.927] WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN 15
[ct=2018.313] MINUTES.
[ct=2019.605] INJURY REPORT.
[ct=2024.601] KAYLEE: WE HAVE SEEN BOTH OF THE
[ct=2024.896] STEELERS OUTSIDE LINEBACKERS
[ct=2025.176] INTO THE BLUE TENT TONIGHT.
[ct=2027.321] ALEX HIGHSMITH IS STILL THERE.
[ct=2029.971] HE IS QUESTIONABLE TO RETURN
[ct=2031.054] BECAUSE MY NECK INJURY.
[ct=2034.493] THE UNAFFILIATED NEUROTRAUMA
[ct=2035.643] CONSULTANT IS INSIDE THE TENT
[ct=2036.520] WITH HIM NOW.
[ct=2039.281] EARLIER, WE SAW T.J. WATT IN
[ct=2041.000] THERE FOR FOUR MINUTES, BUT HE
[ct=2042.773] HAS BEEN BACK IN THE GAME, AND
[ct=2043.546] HIS HELMET NOW HAS A TINTED
[ct=2044.594] VISOR ATTACHED TO IT.
[ct=2046.528] AL: HE WAS ON THE BENCH.
[ct=2051.603] MEANWHILE, THEY START FROM THE
[ct=2053.177] 25 YARD LINE.
[ct=2059.351] TWO RISKY WITH A LITTLE TOSS --
[ct=2060.960] TRUBISKY WITH A LITTLE TOSS
[ct=2061.666] YEAR.
[ct=2061.950] FIVE YARD LOSS.
[ct=2064.245] JENNINGS MAKES THE TACKLE.
[ct=2067.675] AND THE CROWD IS NOT HAPPY.
[ct=2072.487] KIRK: THAT IS A MISMATCH ON THE
[ct=2072.797] EDGE.
[ct=2074.750] WE TALKED ABOUT JENNINGS AND HOW
[ct=2075.631] PHYSICAL HE IS.
[ct=2077.455] WATCH THE TIGHT END ACROSS FROM
[ct=2077.969] HIM, DARNELL WASHINGTON.
[ct=2080.880] HE GOES OUTSIDE, AND THEN
[ct=2083.670] JENNINGS SHOOTS INSIDE.
[ct=2084.545] JUST HAS NO CHANCE, SO IT IS A
[ct=2085.743] MISCOMMUNICATION ON THE EDGE
[ct=2087.529] BETWEEN THE TITANS.
[ct=2088.404] MY GUESS IS WASHINGTON ENDS UP
[ct=2091.107] NEEDING TO COME DOWN TO KEEP HIM
[ct=2091.952] AWAY FROM THAT PENETRATION.
[ct=2095.725] AL: TRUBISKY THROWS.
[ct=2096.843] CAUGHT.
[ct=2104.870] SIGNALED HIM.
[ct=2109.041] WILSON MAKES THE STOP, THIRD
[ct=2109.459] DOWN AND 8.
[ct=2114.089] KIRK: THIS PLAYS INTO NEW
[ct=2114.428] ENGLAND'S HANDS.
[ct=2116.607] THE STEELERS ARE 0-3
[ct=2119.339] THEY KEEP THEM IN THIS THIRD AND
[ct=2119.976] 8.
[ct=2122.849] LAST TIME THEY SHOW THEY WILL
[ct=2124.434] LOOK IN THE PRE-SNAP.
[ct=2125.778] MOVED, THROWS THE INTERCEPTION.
[ct=2128.191] AT SEA WITH A DIAL-UP HERE AT
[ct=2128.650] THIS THIRD DOWN AND LONG.
[ct=2132.892] AL: STEELERS HAVE BROUGHT 16
[ct=2132.892] PLAYS FROM 38 YARDS.
[ct=2137.023] AT THIRD AND 8, TRUBISKY THROWS,
[ct=2138.293] AND THAT IS ALMOST HIT.
[ct=2140.827] THAT WILL BRING A TORRENT OF
[ct=2143.093] BOO'S.
[ct=2145.954] ALEX AUSTIN IS THERE.
[ct=2146.842] YOU SAW IN THE THREE-QUARTER --
[ct=2151.650] YOU SAW TRUBISKY, MASON RUDOLPH,
[ct=2153.397] AND, BY THE WAY, BEN
[ct=2153.703] ROETHLISBERGER IS IN THE
[ct=2154.005] BUILDING.
[ct=2156.599] KIRK: WE SAID HELLO TO HIM
[ct=2156.682] EARLIER.
[ct=2161.036] THIS IS A ROOKIE OUT ON AN
[ct=2161.036] ISLAND ON THIRD DOWN.
[ct=2163.991] THE BALL IS LATE IN BEHIND HIM.
[ct=2167.309] AL: HERE COMES THE CHANT AGAIN.
[ct=2170.210] HERE IS HARVEY'S KICK.
[ct=2176.613] 29 YARD LINE BY MYLESAL: TALKING
[ct=2179.513] DAY ABOUT DRAFTED, GETS PICKED
[ct=2180.777] IN THE FOURTH ROUND, BUT HIS
[ct=2185.953] FRIENDS WERE RANK FALLING HIM,
[ct=2187.215] AND NOW OF A SUDDEN, HE GETS
[ct=2189.802] ANOTHER CALL, ASK THE PHONE UP,
[ct=2190.400] AND THEY SAY, SCOUT FROM THE
[ct=2197.299] PATRIOTS -- PICKS THE PHONE UP,
[ct=2199.375] ELLIOTT PULLS THAT.
[ct=2202.672] HE GETS THE CALL FROM THE SCOUT,
[ct=2203.491] THE SCOUT SAYS, HERE IS BILL
[ct=2203.805] BELICHICK.
[ct=2207.048] BILL BELICHICK SAYS, HEY, HERE,
[ct=2207.759] WE ARE DRAFTING YOU NEXT.
[ct=2209.709] KIRK: SO MUCH FOR WELCOME TO THE
[ct=2210.012] BALL CLUB.
[ct=2211.214] AL: HERE YOU GO, YOU ARE NEXT.
[ct=2215.525] KIRK: BUT HE DID THINK, WHAT IS
[ct=2215.525] GOING ON?
[ct=2217.269] IS ONE OF MY FRIENDS PRINTING
[ct=2217.558] ME?
[ct=2221.452] I AM SURE AFTER BELICHICK HOPPED
[ct=2221.733] ON, HE KNEW.
[ct=2223.267] NOBODY IS DOING THIS.
[ct=2224.655] AL: RIGHT.
[ct=2228.039] KIRK: WITH THE STEELERS OFFENSE
[ct=2230.485] PLAYING THE WAY IT IS, IT IS
[ct=2231.646] TIME FOR THE STEELERS DEFENSE TO
[ct=2232.844] ASSERT THEMSELVES AND MAKE SOME
[ct=2233.395] PLAYS.
[ct=2235.334] GET THIS GUY BEHIND THE STICKS.
[ct=2238.079] AL: ZAPPE THROWS.
[ct=2240.468] DROPPED UP AT THE 30 YARD LINE.
[ct=2244.372] ZEKE ELLIOTT IS A BUSY MAN
[ct=2246.668] TONIGHT, HE CARRIED SIX TIMES
[ct=2249.161] FOR NINE YARDS AND SCORED THREE
[ct=2249.161] FOR 32, THIRD AND 11.
[ct=2252.771] KIRK: WE HAVE SEEN ALL THESE
[ct=2254.000] BACKUP QUARTERBACKS.
[ct=2254.000] JAKE BROWNING HAD A BIG GAME FOR
[ct=2254.302] CINCINNATI.
[ct=2256.266] GARDNER MINSHEW FROM
[ct=2256.608] INDIANAPOLIS.
[ct=2259.464] ZAPPE OFF TO A GOOD START.
[ct=2261.929] THAT IS A BIG THEME THIS YEAR
[ct=2262.147] AND NFL, THESE HIGH-PROFILE
[ct=2264.818] QUARTERBACKS GOING DOWN, AND A
[ct=2265.794] LOT OF TIMES, THAT BACKUP IS NOT
[ct=2266.491] READY TO ANSWER BUT ZAPPE
[ct=2268.203] TONIGHT IS DOING THAT.
[ct=2271.072] AL: THIRD AND 11.
[ct=2277.615] SHOULDERS SHAKE.
[ct=2279.651] OUT HERE TO ELLIOTT.
[ct=2284.165] ZEKE LOOKING FOR THAT FIRST.
[ct=2284.463] COMES UP SHORT THREE YARDS IN
[ct=2285.169] FRONT OF THE STEELERS BENCH.
[ct=2289.989] KIRK: I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO
[ct=2290.835] PROBLEM AT ALL.
[ct=2291.736] THAT IS A GREAT PLAY BY BAILEY
[ct=2296.441] HE WENT THROUGH THREE OR FOUR
[ct=2297.147] DIFFERENT PROGRESSIONS.
[ct=2297.398] EVERYBODY IS COVERED.
[ct=2298.004] THEY PLAYED THE ZONE.
[ct=2301.379] INSTEAD OF FORCING THE BALL,
[ct=2302.078] THAT HAS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH MAC
[ct=2302.078] JONES.
[ct=2305.498] THEY TRY TO MAKE A PLAY AND IT
[ct=2305.498] ENDS UP BEING A TURNOVER ON
[ct=2305.752] THIRD DOWN.
[ct=2308.812] HE JUST TEXTED DOWN AND ALMOST
[ct=2311.153] GAVE ZEKE A CHANCE TO PICK UP
[ct=2312.049] THAT FIRST DOWN.
[ct=2312.718] HE PUNTED AWAY, NO PROBLEM.
[ct=2316.123] AL: BRYCE BERINGER'S THIRD PUNT
[ct=2316.421] OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=2319.251] THAT ONE WILL SKID INTO THE END
[ct=2319.810] ZONE.
[ct=2324.209] KIRK: TIME FOR THE
[ct=2327.163] HIGH-PERFORMANCE 4K SKYCAM
[ct=2327.453] PRESENTED BY BMW.
[ct=2331.372] THIS PATRIOTS DEFENSE HAS BEEN
[ct=2332.139] DOING A LOT OF DAMAGE IN THE
[ct=2333.243] EARLY PART OF THE GAME, WHETHER
[ct=2336.203] IT IS DEFENDING A RUN -- YEARS
[ct=2336.685] JENNINGS AGAINST JAYLEN WARREN.
[ct=2339.536] PEPPER IS DISGUISING A PART OF
[ct=2341.070] THAT DEFENSE AND THEN
[ct=2342.533] RECOGNIZING THE BALL IN THE AIR
[ct=2342.533] AND CAPITALIZES.
[ct=2343.164] STEPS IN FRONT OF IT.
[ct=2345.381] GETS HIS OWN OFFENSE.
[ct=2346.653] REALLY GOOD FIELD POSITION.
[ct=2349.249] THEY WERE ABLE TO PUT ANOTHER
[ct=2350.073] TOUCHDOWN ON THE BOARD.
[ct=2351.023] THIS LOOKS LIKE A DIFFERENT TEAM
[ct=2354.188] THAN 15 THAT HAS PLAYED ALL YEAR
[ct=2355.049] AND THE TEAM THAT PLAYED LAST
[ct=2356.658] WEEK, WHEN THEY DID NOT GET
[ct=2356.905] ANYTHING ON THE BOARD.
[ct=2358.079] AL: THE LAST THREE WEEKS.
[ct=2361.944] SINGLE DIGITS EACH WEEK, ALREADY
[ct=2362.211] 14 ON THE BOARD TONIGHT.
[ct=2366.889] FROM THE 20 YARD LINE, JAYLEN
[ct=2372.372] TRUBISKY ROLLING.
[ct=2373.457] KEEPING.
[ct=2376.674] DOWN HE GOES AFTER A GAIN OF
[ct=2377.016] THREE.
[ct=2379.802] KIRK: I THINK WE CAME IN TONIGHT
[ct=2381.285] KNOWING THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE
[ct=2384.441] TOUGH ON TRUBISKY, BUT,
[ct=2385.155] ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT
[ct=2387.660] JAYLEN WARREN AND NAJI HARRIS
[ct=2389.880] HAVE BEEN A NON-FACTOR SO FAR IN
[ct=2389.880] RUNNING THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=2393.384] HARRIS HAS SIX YARDS ON SIX
[ct=2393.594] CARRIES.
[ct=2397.213] WARREN NEGATIVE TWO YARDS.
[ct=2399.227] IT IS OBVIOUSLY EASY TO POINT TO
[ct=2402.556] TRUBISKY AND HIS PASSING GAME,
[ct=2404.207] BUT THEY NEED MORE FROM THIS
[ct=2406.463] OFFENSE OF LINE AND THIS RUNNING
[ct=2407.211] GAME TO TAKE SOME OF THE
[ct=2408.186] PRESSURE OFF OF WHAT THEY ARE
[ct=2409.158] DOING THROWING THE BALL BECAUSE
[ct=2410.154] RIGHT NOW THEY ARE OUT OF RHYTHM
[ct=2410.494] IN A BIG WAY.
[ct=2415.424] AL: THE TOUCHDOWN THAT PUT HENRY
[ct=2417.190] INTO THE TENT ON THE NEW ENGLAND
[ct=2417.583] SIDE, SECOND DOWN AND CENTER.
[ct=2418.367] FLAG.
[ct=2421.531] TWO YARD GAIN HERE FOR WARREN.
[ct=2425.396] CLAY MARTIN TO GIVE US THE CALL.
[ct=2433.232] KIRK: IF I WERE MIKE, ILLEGAL
[ct=2436.559] FORMATION AT WEEK 14 OR WHATEVER
[ct=2437.347] ONE WE ARE IN RIGHT NOW, THAT
[ct=2438.490] WOULD DRIVE ME CRAZY.
[ct=2441.625] FIVE MEN IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=2448.608] AL: GOT TO HAVE AT LEAST SEVEN
[ct=2448.944] UPFRONT.
[ct=2452.937] LOOKING OVER TO BELICHICK TO SEE
[ct=2454.287] WHAT HE WANTS TO DO.
[ct=2458.278] REFEREE: FORMATION ON OFFENSE,
[ct=2462.298] NUMBER 76, ELIGIBLE RECEIVER BUT
[ct=2463.064] DID NOT COVER THE TACKLE.
[ct=2464.492] PENALTY IS DECLINED.
[ct=2466.723] AL: TAKE THE PLAY.
[ct=2472.659] HE IS EXORCISED.
[ct=2476.140] KIRK: YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE
[ct=2476.140] MISTAKES BUT YOU CANNOT MAKE
[ct=2477.080] MENTAL ONES.
[ct=2481.458] AGAIN, THEY END UP DECLINING IT.
[ct=2482.996] IT GETS TO ANOTHER THIRD DOWN.
[ct=2483.893] THEY HAVE NOT CONVERTED YET ON
[ct=2484.212] THIRD DOWN TONIGHT.
[ct=2491.117] AL: THIRD AND 5.
[ct=2501.966] RUSHED FOR.
[ct=2503.467] TRUBISKY THROWS.
[ct=2505.311] OUT OF BOUNDS FOR DYONTAE
[ct=2505.760] JOHNSON.
[ct=2510.388] HIS FIRST TARGET OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=2510.736] THEB
[ct=2514.264] THE BOO’
[ct=2514.834] THE BOO'S ARE DOWN THERE.
[ct=2515.197] FOR EVERY PLAY.
[ct=2518.169] KIRK: LOW PERCENTAGE THROW ONE
[ct=2520.768] THIRD DOWN AND MEDIUM.INSTEAD OF
[ct=2521.344] TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING
[ct=2524.569] , A TIGHT END OR OUT IN THE
[ct=2526.360] BACKFIELD OR A MATCHUP WITH A
[ct=2527.621] CROSSER, THEY GO FOR A HEAVE HO
[ct=2528.894] DOWNFIELD, NO SHOT.
[ct=2531.538] AL: MARVIN.
[ct=2532.262] SHORT TIP.
[ct=2537.269] TAKES IT BOUNCING.
[ct=2539.938] MORE BOO'S RAIN DOWN.
[ct=2541.472] WHERE A START FOR THE STEELERS
[ct=2546.977] 9:48 LEFT INMIKE TOMLIN
[ct=2549.816] TALKED ABOUT WHEN THEY PLAYED JV
[ct=2550.705] FOOTBALL LAST WEEK AGAINST THE
[ct=2552.587] CARDINALS WHO WERE TWO AND 10,
[ct=2554.773] AND THEY ARE RIGHT IN THE OF
[ct=2556.822] THINGS. THIS IS A MUST -- RIGHT
[ct=2559.401] IN THE THICK OF THINGS, AND THIS
[ct=2559.976] IS A MUST WIN GAME.
[ct=2565.013] AL: PRETTY TERRIBLE THUS FAR.
[ct=2565.359] HERE IS ELLIOTT.
[ct=2569.026] MEANWHILE, THE CROWD FRUSTRATED
[ct=2570.149] ABOUT SO MANY THINGS, BUT THEY
[ct=2571.410] LOOKED AT THAT SCHEDULE AND
[ct=2572.562] SAID, HEY, WE HAVE ARIZONA
[ct=2574.256] COMING, NEW ENGLAND, THOSE ARE
[ct=2575.079] TWO WINS.
[ct=2578.772] THEY ALREADY LOST ARIZONA, AND
[ct=2580.266] NOW THEY ARE 11 POINTS DOWN FROM
[ct=2580.782] THE OTHER TWO WITH TEAM.
[ct=2584.441] KIRK: YOU HAVE GREAT LEADERS.
[ct=2585.669] PEOPLE WANTED TO BLAME MATT
[ct=2586.256] CANADA, THIS AND THAT.
[ct=2588.469] AT SOME POINT, THE LEADERS ON
[ct=2591.981] THIS TEAM HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE
[ct=2593.725] DIFFERENCE IN THE STEELERS, THE
[ct=2594.498] GREAT STEELERS TEAM.
[ct=2594.871] THEY LEAD FROM WITHIN.
[ct=2599.196] THE LEADERSHIP FROM THE PLAYERS,
[ct=2600.591] THEY NEED TO STEP UP RIGHT NOW.
[ct=2600.946] SOMEBODY NEEDS TO MAKE PLAYS AND
[ct=2602.936] GET SOME FIRE ON THIS TEAM.
[ct=2607.567] CAUGHT THREE YARDS SHY OF THE
[ct=2608.803] FIRST, TRYING TO PICK UP EXTRA
[ct=2610.614] YARDAGE IS BROWN.
[ct=2616.224] KIRK: WHAT IS AMAZING, I AM SURE
[ct=2616.495] WITH PEOPLE WATCHING, THE
[ct=2617.157] PATRIOTS ARE TWO AND 10.
[ct=2620.439] TO GET A TEAM TO CONTINUE TO
[ct=2620.944] PLAY WITH FIRE AND TO BE
[ct=2624.274] INSPIRED AND GIVE YOU SOME WE
[ct=2625.959] ARE SHOWING UP AND GOING TO BE
[ct=2626.863] ACCOUNTABLE, AS HE SAYS, DO YOUR
[ct=2629.004] JOB, YOU ARE SEEING THAT FROM A
[ct=2629.821] TEAM THAT IS TWO AND 10.
[ct=2632.879] PITTSBURGH IS RIGHT IN THE THICK
[ct=2634.402] OF HIS THING WITH THE WILDCARD.
[ct=2637.720] THEY ALMOST LOOK DISINTERESTED
[ct=2638.170] THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.
[ct=2640.401] AL: TOMLIN SAID A HORRIBLE DAY
[ct=2640.527] AT THE OFFICE.
[ct=2642.649] THIS ONE STARTED OUT THE SAME
[ct=2642.862] WAY.
[ct=2644.371] THIRD DOWN AND 3.
[ct=2647.569] MONTGOMERY IS IN THE GAME.
[ct=2650.271] THAT IS CAUGHT ON THE RUN.
[ct=2655.152] TAKES IT TO THE 25 YARD LINE.
[ct=2661.921] KIRK: THEY CONTINUE TO GO AFTER
[ct=2663.342] THESE LINEBACKERS ON THIRD DOWN.
[ct=2664.044] AGAIN, THEY HAVE HAD SO MANY
[ct=2664.412] INJURIES.
[ct=2667.253] YOU SEE THEM SHOWING PRESSURE.
[ct=2668.330] THEY DROP HERE, AND THAT OPENS
[ct=2668.330] IT UP.
[ct=2671.407] WATCH HIS HEAD ON THE SWIVEL.
[ct=2672.126] HE WORRIES ABOUT HIS RIGHT.
[ct=2674.593] I COULDN’
[ct=2674.963] I COULDN'T -- GOOD JOB OF
[ct=2677.106] RECOGNIZING THAT BY ZAPPE.HE HAD
[ct=2677.702] TWO OPTIONS IN THE MIDDLE
[ct=2681.431] LINEBACKER TAKES HIS OPTION TO
[ct=2681.722] THE LEFT.
[ct=2682.123] THE TIGHT ENDS, NO PROBLEM.
[ct=2683.700] GETS THE BALL TO SMITH AT FIRST
[ct=2687.619] AL: 28 YARD GAME.
[ct=2688.022] HE HAS PICKED UP 82 RECEIVING
[ct=2688.260] YARDS TONIGHT.
[ct=2691.182] MOST HE HAS HAD IN ANY GAME THIS
[ct=2691.514] SEASON.
[ct=2697.212] ZAPPE THROWING.
[ct=2698.389] CAUGHT, HENRY!
[ct=2699.026] TOUCHDOWN!
[ct=2700.194] WHOA!
[ct=2704.514] SO HENRY WHO SCORED THE PRIOR
[ct=2706.206] TOUCHDOWN WENT INTO THE MEDICAL
[ct=2708.488] TENT FOR A MOMENT, COMES BACK,
[ct=2708.488] AND SCORES AGAIN.
[ct=2710.998] KIRK: HOW ABOUT THIS THROW BY
[ct=2711.154] THE KID?
[ct=2714.133] OH MY GOSH.
[ct=2716.713] HE IS PLAYING HATFIELD.
[ct=2719.310] USUALLY, YOU CANNOT MAKE THIS
[ct=2721.911] THROW WITH THE SAFETY SITTING
[ct=2722.563] BACK THERE, BUT HE GIVES IT A
[ct=2723.037] LITTLE PUMP FAKE.
[ct=2726.152] HE THROWS IT ON THE LINE AND
[ct=2726.528] SOMEHOW GETS IT OVER 23.
[ct=2728.853] GREAT CONCENTRATION BY THE BIG
[ct=2731.371] TIGHT END, BUT YOU ARE NOT
[ct=2732.060] SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT
[ct=2733.908] THROW IN THE SAFETY A SITTING
[ct=2733.911] BACK THERE READY TO JUMP ON
[ct=2736.329] I THOUGHT IT MIGHT
[ct=2737.570] BUT IT IS A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=2739.529] AL: RIGHT OVER THE HEAD OF
[ct=2740.221] KHAZEI.
[ct=2744.839] HALFWAY THROUGH THE SECOND
[ct=2744.839] QUARTER.
[ct=2748.041] STUNNINGLY, IF YOU ARE JUST
[ct=2750.345] TUNING IN, YES, THERE ARE 24
[ct=2750.929] POINTS ON THE BOARD.
[ct=2752.851] KIRK: BAILEY ZAPPE REALLY
[ct=2753.788] STEPPED UP TONIGHT.
[ct=2758.090] GIVE O'BRIEN A LOT OF CREDIT.
[ct=2761.273] DOING A GOOD JOB OF MIXING UP
[ct=2761.557] THE PLAY CALL.
[ct=2763.604] YOU WOULD THINK THEY WOULD BE
[ct=2764.366] CONSERVATIVE AND LET'S BE
[ct=2766.738] CAREFUL WITH ZAPPE AGAINST THE
[ct=2767.571] PITTSBURGH DEFENSE.
[ct=2767.787] NO.
[ct=2769.389] THEY GO RIGHT DOWN THE FIELD FOR
[ct=2770.108] A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=2771.937] GREAT THROW TO HENRY.
[ct=2773.391] THIS SAFETY IS SOMEHOW OVER TO
[ct=2776.318] GET IT ON TOP OF HIM.
[ct=2777.688] NUMBER FOUR RIGHT NOW IS FEELING
[ct=2778.334] IT FOR THE PATRIOTS AND HIS
[ct=2780.928] WHERE HAS THIS BEEN ALL YEAR?
[ct=2782.259] AL: HE HAS BEEN ON THE BENCH
[ct=2785.016] MOST OF THE YEAR.
[ct=2786.573] 11 OF 17, 168 YARDS AND THREE
[ct=2786.958] TOUCHDOWNS.
[ct=2789.460] KIRK: JUST EXECUTION OF IT.
[ct=2790.602] HE LOOKS GREAT.
[ct=2791.357] YOU CAN JUST TELL HE IS FEELING
[ct=2792.112] IT RIGHT NOW.
[ct=2799.387] AL: WE MENTIONED IT AT THE
[ct=2801.312] START, YOU GET SHUT OUT, STILL
[ct=2801.312] GET ANOTHER START.
[ct=2803.394] BELICHICK SAYING HE DOES NOT
[ct=2807.193] RIDE THE ROLLER COASTER.
[ct=2807.712] HE LIKES THAT THE EMOTIONS WERE
[ct=2808.021] VERY STEADY.
[ct=2810.912] LOOK WHEN HE HAS DONE TONIGHT.
[ct=2812.434] TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
[ct=2816.489] KIRK: I THOUGHT WHAT JAKE
[ct=2818.110] BROWNING DID THE OTHER NIGHT, NO
[ct=2818.603] ONE EXPECTED TO SEE THAT IN
[ct=2818.772] JACKSONVILLE.
[ct=2821.543] NOW HERE WE HAVE ANOTHER
[ct=2822.877] EXPERIENCE WITH THE BACKUP
[ct=2824.460] QUARTERBACK THAT NOBODY EXPECTED
[ct=2824.885] MUCH FROM.
[ct=2826.662] HE STEPPED UP IN A BIG WAY FIRST
[ct=2826.913] HALF.
[ct=2829.095] AL: HAD HIS FIRST START AT
[ct=2829.491] TENNESSEE.
[ct=2833.781] A TOUCHBACK HERE, WE GO TO
[ct=2833.781] KAYLEE.
[ct=2837.576] KAYLEE: EACH STEP IN ZAPPE'S
[ct=2844.331] CAREER, HE WAS DOUBTED, TOLD HE
[ct=2844.880] WAS NOT FAST ENOUGH OR ATHLETIC
[ct=2845.247] ENOUGH, BUT HIS COLLEGE
[ct=2845.714] COORDINATOR OF FOUR YEARS TOLD
[ct=2846.848] ME HE HAS NEVER SEEN ZAPPE'S
[ct=2848.907] COMPETENCE WAIVER BECAUSE HE
[ct=2849.325] BELIEVES HE CAN OUTWORK ANYBODY.
[ct=2851.418] IT WAS A WAKE-UP CALL WHEN HE
[ct=2854.132] GOT CUT BY THE PATRIOTS IN CAMP,
[ct=2856.573] AND EVEN AS HE SIGNED WITH THEIR
[ct=2858.706] PRACTICE SQUAD THE NEXT DAY, HE
[ct=2860.181] TOLD HIM, TRUST ME, I GOT THIS.
[ct=2860.477] EVENTUALLY, I WILL BE THE
[ct=2860.477] STARTER.
[ct=2864.302] AL: HE WILL NOT LOSE HIS JOB
[ct=2864.302] BEFORE THE END OF THIS GAME.
[ct=2864.949] I KNOW THAT.
[ct=2868.117] KIRK: THIS COULD NOT HAVE GONE
[ct=2868.488] ANY BETTER.
[ct=2869.806] AL: PERFECT.
[ct=2874.076] MEANWHILE, THE STEELERS, DOWN BY
[ct=2874.076] 18.
[ct=2881.334] FINALLY THEY GET SOMETHING.
[ct=2885.312] JALEN MILLS.
[ct=2888.251] KIRK: I JUST LIKE TO SEE ANYTIME
[ct=2892.941] YOU CAN GET THE BALL IN SPACE,
[ct=2893.939] WHETHER HE IS WRITING IN THE
[ct=2895.552] OUTSIDE ZONE, WHERE HE IS ABLE
[ct=2896.935] TO FIND THAT OUTSIDE, STRETCH
[ct=2897.863] IT, GET UP FIELD ON THIS.
[ct=2899.711] YOU HAVE THREE BLOCKERS IN
[ct=2902.236] FRONT, THE RECEIVERS DO THEIR
[ct=2903.978] JOB, AND HE HAS GREAT QUICKNESS
[ct=2905.084] TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT FIELD.
[ct=2905.876] NICE, EASY THROW.
[ct=2914.858] AL: NAJI HARRIS BACK. HE TAKES
[ct=2919.795] AUSTIN GIVES THE CROWD SOMETHING
[ct=2920.894] TO CHEER ABOUT AS HE TAKES IT TO
[ct=2922.632] THE HATFIELD YARD LINE.
[ct=2925.369] NUMBER 73, FIRST HALF.
[ct=2927.968] KIRK: TRUBISKY TRYING TO GET
[ct=2929.220] INVOLVED, MAYBE TAKE SOME OF HIS
[ct=2929.220] FRUSTRATION OUT.
[ct=2933.069] TRYING TO OPEN HIS PLAYBOOK.
[ct=2934.623] THAT IS WARREN, BY THE WAY,
[ct=2936.689] EMOTION, MAYBE TRYING TO DRAW
[ct=2937.663] THE DEFENSE'S ATTENTION AND THEN
[ct=2938.420] GO BACK THE OTHER WAY.
[ct=2941.710] WATCH TRUBISKY, APPRECIATE THE
[ct=2945.345] EFFORT.TRYING TO TAKE
[ct=2946.020] DOWN PEPPERS BACK TO THAT
[ct=2946.533] POSITIVE FIRST DOWN PLEASE YOUR
[ct=2947.005] FOR THIS PITTSBURGH OFFENSE.
[ct=2950.263] AND YOU COULD KIND OF CALL THIS
[ct=2951.461] A DRIVER THEY HAVE TO COME AWAY
[ct=2952.607] WITH POINTS YEAR, DOWN 21-3.
[ct=2954.518] AL: YEP.
[ct=2956.355] 49 YARD LINE.
[ct=2963.387] PRESSURE, GETS IT AWAY.
[ct=2966.360] TAKING THE BALL IN THE PATRIOT
[ct=2968.458] THAT IS CONNOR HEYWARD.
[ct=2974.588] PRESSURE THAT TIME PUT ON, BUT
[ct=2975.358] HE IS ABLE TO GET IT AWAY BY
[ct=2975.690] KYLE DUGGER.
[ct=2980.533] KIRK: THE MOST FRUSTRATING PART
[ct=2983.280] OF THIS IS NOT BEING ABLE TO
[ct=2983.767] CONTROL THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE
[ct=2984.349] AND RUN THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=2987.253] THE LAST THREE WEEKS, THEY HAVE
[ct=2987.253] BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT.
[ct=2990.574] IT IS A BIGGER CHALLENGE, AS WE
[ct=2990.933] SAID.
[ct=2992.465] IT WILL BE TOUGH TO SEE HOW THEY
[ct=2993.711] DO AGAINST ONE OF THE BEST RUN
[ct=2994.039] DEFENSES IN THE LEAGUE.
[ct=2996.558] BUT BY NOT BEING ABLE TO GET
[ct=2998.322] THAT RUN GAME GOING, THEY ARE
[ct=3000.105] NOT GETTING THE SAFETIES DOWN TO
[ct=3000.862] CREATE THE ONE-ON-ONE
[ct=3001.090] OPPORTUNITIES FOR PICKENS.
[ct=3002.328] AL: SECOND AND 5.
[ct=3007.389] FIGHTING HIS WAY ON WHAT SHOULD
[ct=3009.088] BE A FIRST DOWN, NAUSEA HARRIS.
[ct=3011.084] CONNOR HEYWARD -- KNOWLEDGE A
[ct=3016.071] WHEN CONNOR HEYWARD MADE THAT
[ct=3016.526] PLAY, THEY ARE GOING TO MARKET A
[ct=3017.205] LITTLE BIT SHORT FOR HARRIS.
[ct=3017.477] NO-HUDDLE HERE.
[ct=3022.147] THIRD AND INCHES.
[ct=3029.185] AND A NON-PUSH I CAN PUSH -- AND
[ct=3030.510] A NON-PUSH PUSH.
[ct=3032.231] KIRK: WE ARE NOT IN PHILLY.
[ct=3044.542] AL: UNDER FIVE MINUTES AND
[ct=3047.072] UNDERPLAYING THE OPENING HALF.
[ct=3048.936] 36 YARDS PLUS THE PICK.
[ct=3051.664] HARRIS DOING NEXT TO NOTHING ON
[ct=3051.840] THE GROUND.
[ct=3055.559] PICKENS HAS SCORED ONE.
[ct=3074.907] MOORE INTO THE 35 YARD LINE --
[ct=3076.993] WARREN TO THE 35 YARD LINE.
[ct=3084.045] KIRK: ONE OF THE INDICATORS
[ct=3087.701] TEAMS HAVE IS STUDYING RECEIVERS
[ct=3089.668] AND HOW THEY COME OFF THE LINE
[ct=3090.271] ON A RUN VERSUS PASS.
[ct=3091.803] HERE IS GEORGE PICKENS ON A RUN
[ct=3092.096] THIS LAST PLAY.
[ct=3095.699] HE HAS KIND OF TAKEN THE
[ct=3096.256] PLAYOFF.
[ct=3097.920] I THINK IT SENDS A MESSAGE TO
[ct=3098.492] YOUR TEAM.
[ct=3101.094] I LOOK AT RECEIVERS, THEIR
[ct=3102.797] WILLINGNESS TO BLOCK, AND THE
[ct=3104.060] EFFORT THEY'RE WILLING TO PUT
[ct=3104.657] FORTH, KIND OF REPRESENTS THE
[ct=3105.180] PULSE OF THE TEAM.
[ct=3108.604] AL: PERFECT POINT.
[ct=3110.152] SECOND DOWN AND 5.
[ct=3112.533] THE PASS IS LOW AND INCOMPLETE.
[ct=3117.764] TRYING TO GET IT IN THEIR, UNDER
[ct=3117.986] THERE BY KYLE DUGGER.
[ct=3130.142] AND THE LITTLE CONFERENCE HERE
[ct=3131.648] AMONGST FOUR OFFICIALS.
[ct=3135.414] NOW DOWN TO THREE.
[ct=3143.748] MARTIN.
[ct=3145.703] REFEREE: PASS INTERFERENCE.
[ct=3147.406] DEFENSE, NUMBER 23.
[ct=3155.642] KIRK: I THINK CHOIR MOVES IN THE
[ct=3158.347] MIDDLE OF THE OFFENSE, JOHNSON
[ct=3159.397] ON OUTSIDE, PICKENS WHO CAN
[ct=3163.922] STRETCH DEFENSE.
[ct=3165.255] IT OPENS UP THE MIDDLE.
[ct=3165.255] WE SAW THAT WHEN THEY WENT TO
[ct=3168.905] CINCINNATI TWO WEEKS AGO, THEY
[ct=3169.669] GOT THE BALL WITH THE SAFETY
[ct=3170.059] SPLITTING.
[ct=3173.328] IT WORKED DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE
[ct=3173.732] SEAMS.
[ct=3175.321] I AM SURE THAT IS SOMETHING THEY
[ct=3176.096] WANTED AT SOME POINT TO TRY TO
[ct=3176.493] GET TO AGAIN TONIGHT.
[ct=3177.975] HE IS A GREAT WEAPON.
[ct=3180.110] REMINDS ME OF A LONGER MIKE
[ct=3184.218] ANGELA WITH HIS BODY AND
[ct=3184.724] VERSATILITY AND WHAT HE CAN DO.
[ct=3187.134] AL: WARREN.
[ct=3190.962] HE IS STACKED UP AFTER PICKING
[ct=3191.445] UP FOUR.
[ct=3194.038] BENTLEY THE FIRST GUY TO HIT HIM
[ct=3194.038] THERE.
[ct=3197.713] HE PICKED UP FOUR FIRST DOWNS ON
[ct=3198.067] THIS RUSH.
[ct=3202.650] STARTED BACK AT THE 25, MORE
[ct=3203.546] THAN FOUR MINUTES.
[ct=3204.836] IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO GET
[ct=3205.334] ON THE BOARD BEFORE THE HALF.
[ct=3208.648] KIRK: YOU TALKED ABOUT MIKE
[ct=3209.531] TOMLIN FEELING THIS WAS A
[ct=3209.531] REDEMPTION WEEK.
[ct=3211.527] I THINK THIS IS A REDEMPTION
[ct=3213.350] DRIVE DOWN. 21-3
[ct=3216.040] THEY HAVE TO COME AWAY WITH
[ct=3216.040] POINTS.
[ct=3217.780] GET THEMSELVES TO BELIEVE.
[ct=3223.111] THEY GET THE BALL THE SECOND
[ct=3223.510] HALF, THEY HAVE TO GET
[ct=3224.336] THEMSELVES TO BELIEVE THEY CAN
[ct=3224.624] COME BACK IN THIS GAME.
[ct=3227.312] AL: HAYWARD AND WATT, THE
[ct=3227.813] DEFENSE ON THAT SIDELINE.
[ct=3230.221] SECOND DOWN AND 6.
[ct=3231.859] HERE COMES THE BLITZ FROM THE
[ct=3232.250] OUTSIDE.
[ct=3235.077] THE PASS IS GOING TO BE CAUGHT
[ct=3236.470] IN THE END ZONE BY JOHNSON!
[ct=3243.098] 25 YARDS.
[ct=3247.715] DUGGER WAS CLINCHING, PICK THEM
[ct=3249.605] UP, GAVE TRUBISKY TIME TO SEND
[ct=3250.822] IT TO THE END ZONE FOR THEIR
[ct=3251.203] FIRST TOUCHDOWN OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=3254.289] KIRK: GOOD JOB BY THE
[ct=3254.289] PROTECTION.
[ct=3254.969] YOU MENTIONED HARRIS AND
[ct=3258.624] TRUBISKY FEELS THIS PRESSURE
[ct=3258.624] RIGHT HERE.
[ct=3262.397] NAUSEA A HARRIS PICKS IT UP, --
[ct=3263.112] HARRIS KNOWS IT IS THERE, BUT
[ct=3263.990] TRUBISKY PICKS IT UP.
[ct=3267.177] HE HELPS HARRIS OUT AND THEN
[ct=3268.398] PUTS IT OVER THE OUTSIDE
[ct=3270.304] SHOULDER OF JOHNSON TO MAKE THAT
[ct=3271.553] PLAY OVERTOP OF J.C. JACKSON FOR
[ct=3271.553] THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=3272.310] THEY ANSWER THE CALL.
[ct=3274.676] THEY NEEDED THE POINTS, AND THEY
[ct=3274.676] GOT THEM.
[ct=3279.800] AL: IF YOU LIKE THE OVER, THEY
[ct=3280.131] HAVE ALSO ANSWERED THE CALL.
[ct=3282.321] CHRIS BOSWELL WITH THE EXTRA
[ct=3282.722] POINT.
[ct=3287.048] 2:50 TO GO IN THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=3290.159] 21-10.
[ct=3290.159] NEW ENGLAND.
[ct=3292.932] THOUGHT THAT
[ct=3293.737] THERE WOULD ONLY BE -- SOME
[ct=3296.474] PEOPLE THOUGHT THERE WOULD ONLY
[ct=3296.673] BE 30 POINTS IN THIS GAME.
[ct=3298.074] NOT AWS.
[ct=3304.062] FRIENDLY LOCAL BOOKMAKER.
[ct=3308.097] KAYLEE WILL BE NEXT.
[ct=3308.902] WE WILL GET A REPORT FROM HER
[ct=3311.989] AND A SECOND, AS MONTGOMERY
[ct=3313.394] STOPS AT THE 22 YARD LINE.
[ct=3317.081] KAYLEE: THOSE OF THE NOMINEES
[ct=3320.082] FEATURE TONIGHT, THEY WANT TO
[ct=3321.150] POWER THE NEXT GENERATION.
[ct=3321.676] JONES WAS INSPIRED BY HIS
[ct=3324.298] EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER TO
[ct=3325.547] BECOME THE FIRST MALE AMBASSADOR
[ct=3326.004] FOR PLAY LIKE A GIRL.
[ct=3329.311] HIS NEXT STEP FOUNDATION IMPACTS
[ct=3330.092] KIDS IN NEW ENGLAND AND GEORGIA.
[ct=3334.808] AND BECAUSE SIX TIME NOMINEE
[ct=3336.443] HAYWARD BELIEVES EVERY KID NEED
[ct=3337.616] SOMEONE ROOTING FOR THEM, HIS
[ct=3339.859] HOUSES FIGHTING CHILDHOOD HUNGER

[ct=3365.299] AL: BRENDEN SCHOOLER.
[ct=3367.731] KIRK: HE WILL GO AFTER THE
[ct=3368.195] WHISTLE.
[ct=3370.995] THEY WOULD HAVE HAD THE BALL AT
[ct=3371.005] THE 22.
[ct=3374.838] AND A LOOK AT THE TIME, 2:46.
[ct=3377.698] THE LAWYER QUARTERBACK IS
[ct=3379.330] PLAYING, YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT
[ct=3379.680] GETTING INTO THE FIELD GOAL
[ct=3380.069] RANGE.
[ct=3381.928] MAYBE THEY GO BACK TO THEIR 11
[ct=3382.117] YARD.
[ct=3387.548] AL: JOE JUDGE, THE SPECIAL
[ct=3387.698] TEAM'S COACH, HEAD COACH OF THE
[ct=3388.765] GIANTS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.
[ct=3393.013] 2:46.
[ct=3395.011] EACH TEAM HAS HIS FULL
[ct=3395.167] COMPLEMENT OF TIMEOUTS.
[ct=3399.160] START FROM THE 11TH.
[ct=3399.458] CROWD BACK INTO IT NOW.
[ct=3404.669] DECENT HOLD.
[ct=3404.669] CLOSES QUICKLY.
[ct=3409.754] GAINED A FOUR SECOND DOWN AT
[ct=3413.649] KIRK: STEELERS CALLING A
[ct=3413.943] TIMEOUT.
[ct=3416.228] THEY ARE SENSING IT MAY BE A
[ct=3416.477] CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO TRY TO
[ct=3418.138] GET THE BALL BACK AND SEE THEY
[ct=3419.922] CAN GET FIELD GOAL RANGE
[ct=3419.922] THEMSELVES.
[ct=3430.872] AL: WEEK 14 BEGINNING TONIGHT,
[ct=3432.389] THEY ARE DIVISION LEADERS, AND

[ct=3434.929] SEASON ENDED RIGHT NOW,
[ct=3437.569] STEELERS-BROWNS-COLTS, AND
[ct=3438.463] ALMOST EVERYBODY ELSE'S IN THE
[ct=3438.743] HUNT.
[ct=3446.223] KIRK: LOOK AT GOES TEAMS AT
[ct=3447.825] SIX AND SIX.
[ct=3448.164] THESE NEXT FOUR TO FIVE WEEKS
[ct=3448.575] WILL BE VERY EXCITING.
[ct=3452.028] AL: SECOND DOWN AND 6.
[ct=3457.115] THAT IS CAUGHT FOR A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=3460.234] THIS TY MONTGOMERY MAKES THE
[ct=3460.484] GRAB.
[ct=3463.224] HE HAS BEEN AROUND NINE YEARS.
[ct=3468.135] KIRK: GO AFTER MYKAL WALKER
[ct=3469.994] AGAIN IN COVERAGE.
[ct=3474.112] ALEXANDER AND ROBERTS, SO THEY
[ct=3474.861] HAD TO BRING SOME OTHERS UP.
[ct=3477.685] BLAKE MARTINEZ HAD OFFICIALLY
[ct=3477.685] RETIRED.
[ct=3480.399] THEY ARE BEAT UP AND LINEBACKER.
[ct=3484.843] NEW ENGLAND NEW THAT THAT WAS
[ct=3486.249] THE POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY, AND
[ct=3486.818] THEY HAVE ATTACKED THAT A LOT
[ct=3487.252] THIS FIRST HALF.
[ct=3490.714] AL: THAT FIRST DOWN ENABLES THEM
[ct=3492.763] TO RUN SOME TIME OFF THE CLOCK
[ct=3494.617] AFTER NEW ENGLAND HAD USE THEIR
[ct=3497.449] FIRST TIMEOUT COMING UP ON THE
[ct=3499.440] TWO MINUTE WARNING HERE.
[ct=3501.583] ZAPPEZAPPE TO THE OUTSIDE --
[ct=3504.010] ZAPPE TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=3506.192] A LEAPING GRABBED BY THORNTON.
[ct=3506.475] THAT TAKES US TO THE TWO MINUTE
[ct=3506.815] WARNING.
[ct=3510.607] 21-10, PATRIOTS LEADING THE
[ct=3512.648] STEELERS IN PITTSBURGH ON THIS
[ct=3512.919] THURSDAY NIGHT.
[ct=3514.295] ADORNED STATE FARM
[ct=3514.358] HALFTIME CREW.
[ct=3517.857] DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR WARDROBE
[ct=3517.857] BUDGET WAS?
[ct=3519.475] KIRK: I CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE IT.
[ct=3522.035] I DID NOT KNOW THEY HAD HELP.
[ct=3522.873] UNTIL A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
[ct=3523.834] AL: NO KIDDING.
[ct=3526.462] KIRK: YOU AND I ARE JUST OVER
[ct=3526.462] HERE --
[ct=3531.853] AL: WE HAD THE ARMY SURPLUS
[ct=3531.853] STORE.
[ct=3533.384] THAT PASSES LOW, JUGGLED,
[ct=3533.767] INCOMPLETE.
[ct=3537.042] THIRD AND 7.
[ct=3540.938] KIRK: ONE OF THE FEW MISTAKES WE
[ct=3541.828] HAVE SEEN FROM THIS RECEIVER
[ct=3543.547] GROUP, WE ARE FOCUSING A LOT ON
[ct=3546.045] ZAPPE, BUT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS
[ct=3547.299] A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD HIS
[ct=3548.106] THEY HAVE HAD INJURIES ON THE
[ct=3550.114] THEY HAVE NOT BEEN REAL
[ct=3552.557] CONSISTENT AND RECEIVER.
[ct=3553.234] TONIGHT, THAT IS A DIFFERENT
[ct=3553.503] STORY.
[ct=3556.518] THE TIGHT ENDS WITH HUNTER HENRY
[ct=3557.182] AND THE RECEIVERS PLAY MUCH
[ct=3559.732] BETTER TO GIVE ZAPPE SOME
[ct=3559.732] SEPARATION AND CHANCES.
[ct=3563.784] AL: THEY WILL GET THE FIRST DOWN
[ct=3563.784] HERE.
[ct=3567.293] PITTSBURGH IS LOOKING FOR THAT
[ct=3569.131] TWO FOR ONE.
[ct=3569.768] GET THAT BALL TO SCORE AT THE
[ct=3571.655] AND OF THE HALF AND GET IT TO
[ct=3572.637] START THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=3576.665] ZAPPE THROWS.
[ct=3578.327] CAUGHT, AND THAT IS GOING TO BE
[ct=3581.266] ENOUGH FOR A FIRST DOWN SO
[ct=3583.337] HUNTER HENRY HAVING A BIG NIGHT,
[ct=3585.848] TWO TOUCHDOWNS, HIS THIRD CATCH
[ct=3587.617] OF THE NIGHT, AND THAT FORCES
[ct=3589.422] PITTSBURGH IT'S NOT BEEN ABLE TO
[ct=3590.176] USE TIMEOUT.
[ct=3593.777] KIRK: THE RIGHT TACKLE, WHO IS
[ct=3596.106] REALLY A GUARD, HOLING UP ON AN
[ct=3597.142] ISLAND OFTEN AGAINST T.J. WATT,
[ct=3597.575] WHICH IS A BIG SURPRISE.
[ct=3601.992] ESPECIALLY IN THESE TWO MINUTE
[ct=3601.992] WARNING OBVIOUS PASSING
[ct=3602.303] SITUATIONS.
[ct=3613.092] AL: 31 YARD LINE.
[ct=3618.089] LANDON ROBERTS, HAVE NOT CALLED
[ct=3619.439] HIS NAME TONIGHT, BUT COMES IN
[ct=3621.023] AND MAKES THE SACK.
[ct=3622.419] PLAYED IN THREE SUPER BOWLS WITH
[ct=3625.605] NEW ENGLAND, AND NOW PITTSBURGH
[ct=3626.218] WILL TAKE A TIMEOUT.
[ct=3627.896] KIRK: THESE ARE WELL-DESIGNED.
[ct=3632.212] ROBERTS WORKS AROUND THAT PICK.
[ct=3633.255] NICE JOB OF BEING PATIENT, WORKS
[ct=3635.617] AROUND IT, NEW ENGLAND IS NOT
[ct=3638.698] COMMUNICATE, AND ONE OF THE
[ct=3639.524] FIRST TIMES WE HAVE SEEN ZAPPE
[ct=3641.902] WITH SERIOUS PRESSURE.
[ct=3644.241] THIS LINE IS GOING TO HAVE A JOB
[ct=3644.628] TAKING CARE OF IT.
[ct=3649.625] AL: SECOND DOWN AND YOU CAN SEE
[ct=3653.760] THAT RIGHT ARM, RIGHT ELBOW, SO
[ct=3656.319] HE PLAYED A PRICE THERE, AND WE
[ct=3658.082] WILL CHECK IT OUT HERE ON SECOND
[ct=3659.664] DOWN AND PLAY.
[ct=3666.538] STEELERS HAVE ONE TIMEOUT
[ct=3666.885] REMAINING.
[ct=3669.395] GOING TO KEEP IT ON THE GROUND.
[ct=3670.315] PITTSBURGH USING THAT FINAL
[ct=3672.390] TAKES ELLIOTT DOWN.
[ct=3675.165] THIRD DOWN AND 21.
[ct=3679.723] AL: THIRD AND 21.
[ct=3680.543] AND A WHISTLE HERE.
[ct=3682.284] NOW YOU HAVE A BLOOD SPOT ON
[ct=3683.877] ZAPPE’
[ct=3685.485] ZAPPE'S RIGHT ELBOW, SO CLAY
[ct=3686.791] MARTIN COMES IN.
[ct=3696.874] AND HE IS GOING TO, THOUGHT FOR
[ct=3697.676] THE MOMENT TAKE HIM OUT, BUT,
[ct=3700.316] HE WILL RESET THE PLAY CLOCK.
[ct=3702.442] 25 SECONDS.
[ct=3708.390] I AM SURE THAT THEY WILL JUST
[ct=3711.729] RUN THE BALL AND RUN THE CLOCK
[ct=3712.654] AND TRY TO GO FOR 21 YARDS HERE.
[ct=3714.993] KIRK: I THINK THAT IS WHY THEY
[ct=3715.424] RAN THE BALL LAST PLAY.
[ct=3719.387] AL: BELICHICK IS PRETTY GOOD AT
[ct=3720.215] WORKING THE CLOCK.
[ct=3724.967] AL: HE HAS ONLY BEEN COACHING 49
[ct=3725.667] YEARS IN THE NHL.
[ct=3729.571] STARTED AS A LOW-LEVEL ASSISTANT
[ct=3736.165] , BACK IN THE 1970'S IN DETROIT,
[ct=3739.161] AND THEN CLEVELAND MOVED TO
[ct=3739.598] BALTIMORE BACK IN 1996.
[ct=3741.858] INTERESTING TRAIL WITH BILL.
[ct=3744.189] WE WILL GET INTO IT IN THE
[ct=3747.315] SECOND HALF WITH THE FUTURE ON
[ct=3748.072] HOLD FOR HIM.
[ct=3749.387] MEANWHILE, THEY WILL RUN THE
[ct=3750.317] CLOCK DOWN WITH ALMOST NO TIME
[ct=3751.520] AT ALL.
[ct=3762.902] AND THEY WILL USE ALL OF THE
[ct=3762.902] CLOCK.
[ct=3778.214] REFEREE: TIMEOUT TO NEW ENGLAND
[ct=3779.438] WAS CALLED PRIOR TO ANY MOVEMENT
[ct=3782.360] ON THE LINE, SO 30-SECOND
[ct=3787.013] AL: ONE OF THE STORIES, BILL
[ct=3788.060] BELICHICK, I MENTIONED, IT IS AN
[ct=3788.611] EVERYDAY STORY.
[ct=3794.116] WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT THE
[ct=3794.116] SECOND HALF.
[ct=3797.220] THERE ARE A LOT OF POSSIBILITIES
[ct=3797.220] AND ATTENTIVE SPECULATION.
[ct=3801.047] KIRK: ANYTIME YOU HAVE A HALL OF
[ct=3802.015] FAME CAREER, THE BEST COACH TO
[ct=3804.224] EVER COACH, AND A COUPLE OF
[ct=3806.145] YEARS AGO, THE WAY THEY HAVE,
[ct=3807.469] PEOPLE START TO SPECULATE, I
[ct=3808.499] THINK HE GETS ASKED ALL THE
[ct=3809.026] TIME, IS THIS IT?
[ct=3810.163] AND HE SAYS, I
[ct=3812.187] PITTSBURGH.
[ct=3814.097] AL: ABSOLUTELY, THE LAST MOVE.
[ct=3818.757] WITH BILL, IT IS ALWAYS ABOUT
[ct=3818.757] NEXT WEEK.
[ct=3822.413] IN 2014, THEY LOOK TERRIBLE ON A
[ct=3825.863] MONDAY NIGHT GAME IN KANSAS
[ct=3826.131] CITY, AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
[ct=3828.314] IT LOOKS LIKE THE NEW GUY, JIMMY
[ct=3829.710] GAROPPOLO, IS ABOUT READY TO
[ct=3829.971] TAKE OVER FOR TOM BRADY.
[ct=3835.523] SO WE DO THE SUNDAY NIGHT GAME,
[ct=3836.216] WE GO TO FOXBORO, ALL THE PAPERS
[ct=3837.052] ARE TALKING ABOUT IT IS GARROTTE
[ct=3839.962] BELOW'S TIME, BRITT -- JIMMY
[ct=3843.094] GAROPPOLO'S TIME, 80’S TIME IS
[ct=3845.128] FINISHED IN 2014 -- BRADY’
[ct=3845.973] FINISHED IN 2014 -- BRADY'S TIME
[ct=3847.279] IS FINISHED IN 2014, AND WHAT
[ct=3847.693] HAPPENS AT THE END OF THE YEAR?
[ct=3849.976] BRADY WINS THE SUPER BOWL.
[ct=3852.993] KIRK: THAT IS OUR I THINK THE
[ct=3853.760] AUTOMATIC ASSUMPTION THAT IT IS
[ct=3855.803] TIME TO MOVE ON, THAT IS NOT
[ct=3855.803] ALWAYS THE EASY ANSWER.
[ct=3859.479] A LOT OF TIMES, THEY TRY TO DO
[ct=3859.857] THAT WITHIN.
[ct=3861.706] TOM BRADY IS NOT HERE, SO IT IS
[ct=3862.137] A DIFFERENT STORY.
[ct=3863.707] AL: REALLY?
[ct=3868.492] KIRK: SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT
[ct=3869.081] WE WILL GET INTO THAT IN THE
[ct=3870.984] AL: I DID NOT REALIZE YOU LEFT.
[ct=3873.603] KIRK:. I THINK IT IS
[ct=3880.234] PRETTYTWO FABLED COACHES, CERTAI
[ct=3884.244] BELICHICK'S SIDE, FIRST BALLOT
[ct=3884.508] HALL OF FAMER, UNANIMOUS.
[ct=3885.471] HE WILL BE.
[ct=3893.010] TOMLIN, 16 YEARS IN THE LEAGUE,
[ct=3894.098] THE BOUNCING BALL TAKE INTO THE
[ct=3894.339] TWO YARD LINE.
[ct=3898.286] TEX IT BACK, BRINGS IT UP TO THE
[ct=3899.660] 17 YARD LINE.
[ct=3902.915] KIRK: THEY FINALLY FOUND A
[ct=3902.915] RHYTHM OFFENSIVELY AT THE END OF
[ct=3903.345] THAT FIRST HALF.
[ct=3907.415] THEY RAN A SCREEN, THEY GOT A
[ct=3910.010] REVERSE WITH THE TRUBISKY BLOCK.
[ct=3911.317] THEY JUST PICKED UP A FIRST FEW
[ct=3914.741] DOWNS AND THEN ENDED UP GETTING
[ct=3915.442] INTO THAT RHYTHM, AND THEY THREW
[ct=3916.295] THE TOUCHDOWN PASS TO DYONTAE
[ct=3919.120] LET'S SEE IF THEY CAN PICK UP
[ct=3920.340] WHERE THEY LEFT OFFICE IN
[ct=3921.124] OFFENSE BECAUSE THAT WAS THE
[ct=3923.253] FIRST TIME THEY FELT LIKE THEY
[ct=3925.013] FOUND THE OFFENSE OF KIND OF
[ct=3928.396] RHYTHM -- OFFENSIVE KIND OF
[ct=3929.613] RHYTHM THEY WERE LOOKING FOR THE
[ct=3929.613] FIRST 30 MINUTES.
[ct=3932.847] AL: TRUBISKY SIX OF 11 FOR 61
[ct=3934.204] YARDS.
[ct=3939.768] IN THE POCKET.
[ct=3943.571] SETTLE FOR UNDERNEATH.
[ct=3945.820] NOTHING HAPPENING RIGHT THERE AS
[ct=3948.526] HARRIS IS TAKEN DOWN.
[ct=3952.340] KIRK: TRUBISKY HAS BEEN
[ct=3952.694] CHALLENGED HIS ENTIRE
[ct=3954.057] LIKE A LOT OF QUARTERBACKS IN
[ct=3955.096] THE NFL.
[ct=3955.802] TONIGHT, YOU SAW HIM CHALLENGED.
[ct=3960.621] BUT CROWD IS BREWING, CHANTING
[ct=3961.055] MASON RUDOLPH, BREWING HIM OR IS
[ct=3963.886] NOT MOSTLY AFTER ANY
[ct=3965.741] INCOMPLETION AND HE IS ABLE TO
[ct=3966.031] FIGHT THROUGH THAT ADVERSITY.
[ct=3969.664] AND LOOK AT MASON RUDOLPH AND
[ct=3970.194] GET THEM ON THE BOARD.
[ct=3970.542] I DON’
[ct=3971.804] I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WILL BRING
[ct=3973.057] IT BACK ONTO THE SECOND HALF BUT
[ct=3973.586] HE SHOWED A LOT OF GUTS TO GET
[ct=3975.496] THROUGH THAT PART OF THE GAME.
[ct=3980.806] AL: SECOND DOWN AND 10.
[ct=3981.303] DRAW, HARRIS.
[ct=3984.028] FUNNY, YOU HAVE BEEN AROUND A
[ct=3986.671] LONG TIME WHERE OFTENTIMES IF
[ct=3986.944] THE STARTER IS NOT DOING WELL,
[ct=3988.529] THEY WANT THE NUMBER TWO
[ct=3989.847] QUARTERBACK IS THE MOST POPULAR
[ct=3990.528] GUY IN TOWN.
[ct=3993.137] TONIGHT, FOR A WHILE, THE NUMBER
[ct=3993.882] THREE QUARTERBACK WAS THE MOST
[ct=3994.319] POPULAR GUY.
[ct=3996.943] KIRK: NO DOUBT.
[ct=4000.491] MASON RUDOLPH WAS BOOED LAST
[ct=4001.286] YEAR WHEN THEY BROUGHT HIM IN IN
[ct=4002.869] PRESEASON.
[ct=4003.487] IT'S BEEN ONE OF THOSE YEARS FOR
[ct=4004.495] THIS OFFENSE.
[ct=4005.879] ANYTIME YOU LET YOUR OFFENSIVE
[ct=4008.752] COORDINATOR GO IN THE MIDDLE OF
[ct=4008.752] THE YEAR, IT’
[ct=4009.438] THE YEAR, IT'S A STRUGGLE.
[ct=4010.967] THEY ARE SEARCHING FOR AN
[ct=4011.341] IDENTITY.
[ct=4015.176] AL: THE NUMBER ONE QUARTERBACK
[ct=4015.923] KENNY PICKETT HAD SURGERY.
[ct=4019.637] MISSING FOUR WEEKS.
[ct=4021.172] THIRD AND FOUR, PASS CAUGHT.
[ct=4024.868] THAT WILL PICK UP A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4026.124] GET THE CROWD INTO IT.
[ct=4031.123] KIRK: IT'S A NICE OPTION ROUT.
[ct=4034.434] HE'S SUCH A DANGEROUS WEAPON,
[ct=4035.774] HAS SUCH A GOOD FEEL FOR ZONE OR
[ct=4035.774] MAN.
[ct=4037.759] IT'S LIKE HE TROTS OFF THE LINE
[ct=4037.759] OF SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=4041.371] FIRST OF LEVERAGE,
[ct=4042.714] RETURNS.
[ct=4044.323] DEPENDING ON WHAT DEFENSE THEY
[ct=4044.478] ARE IN, HE KNOWS EXACTLY HOW FAR
[ct=4046.267] HE NEEDS TO GO TO GET BEYOND
[ct=4046.706] THIS TICKS.
[ct=4052.509] JUS FLIPS AROUND AND TRUBISKY
[ct=4052.509] IS LOCKED IN.
[ct=4057.426] AL: THE 10TH OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=4061.146] DAVID TO AUSTIN.
[ct=4063.235] GIVES IT TO WARRANT.
[ct=4067.254] CIRCLES ALL THE WAY BACK, STARTS
[ct=4068.129] TO STUMBLE, THAT ONE DOESN'T
[ct=4068.542] WORK.
[ct=4073.465] SECOND DOWN, WISE MAKES A
[ct=4075.102] THAT'S A LOSS OF SEVEN YARD.
[ct=4077.832] KIRK: THEY HAD THAT BIG RIVERS
[ct=4079.443] THEY DON'T FOOL HIM THIS TIME.
[ct=4081.796] WISE DOES HIS JOB.
[ct=4084.366] THIS GUY IS A BIG MAN, VERY
[ct=4088.447] UNDERRATED AT 6'6" 280.
[ct=4090.043] GARZA LOOKED DOWN THEN SEES WHAT
[ct=4090.043] WARREN IS DOING AND JUST BY
[ct=4092.661] GETTING IN THE WAY AND SLOWING
[ct=4093.355] HIM DOWN ALLOWS THE SPEED OF
[ct=4093.803] THAT DEFENSE.
[ct=4096.767] GOOD DISCIPLINE THAT TIME AND
[ct=4098.678] GOOD DIVISION BY THE BIG
[ct=4099.407] DEFENSIVE END, DEATRICH WISE.
[ct=4111.797] GETS TO ABOUT THE 30-YARD LINE.
[ct=4114.712] THIRD AND 11 UPCOMING.
[ct=4121.400] KIRK: ON AN NATIONAL LEVEL, YOU
[ct=4122.152] LOOK AT THAT NATIONAL FOOTBALL
[ct=4123.059] LEAGUE, NAME SOME GREAT PLAYERS
[ct=4124.917] ON THIS PATRIOTS DEFENSE.
[ct=4126.435] THAT'S WHY LOVE IS DEEP AND SO
[ct=4129.293] MUCH, IT'S REALLY HARD TO THINK
[ct=4130.823] OF NAMES AND JUST JUMP OUT.
[ct=4133.194] WITH HIM OUT WITH HIS INJURY,
[ct=4134.030] THERE IS NOT THAT GUY.
[ct=4137.823] ROOKIE CHRISTIAN GONZALEZ
[ct=4139.087] FLASHING EARLY THEN HE GOES DOWN
[ct=4139.087] WITH INJURY.
[ct=4140.867] OTHER THAN THAT, THERE IS A
[ct=4142.422] BUNCH OF GUYS WHO LOVE TO PLAY
[ct=4144.027] FOOTBALL TOGETHER AND PLAY HARD.
[ct=4145.871] AL: THAT'S HAPPENED A LOT.
[ct=4150.344] BELLA CHECK BRINGS GUYS OFF THE
[ct=4151.286] STREET, THEY DO THE JOB.
[ct=4153.740] THIRD DOWN AND 10, CATCH IS
[ct=4154.147] MADE.
[ct=4156.952] THROWS FOR A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4162.085] CONNOR HEYWARD, JAMES' BROTHER.
[ct=4166.611] AND IT'S ENOUGH FOR A FIRST.
[ct=4169.348] KIRK: I WAS LOOKING FOR 97 TO
[ct=4172.392] COME DOWN AND GIVE A BIG BEAR
[ct=4172.392] HUG.
[ct=4173.673] WHAT A JUMP BY THE BIG MAN TO
[ct=4174.281] GET UP AND OVER.
[ct=4175.316] I THOUGHT HE IS CHECKING IT
[ct=4178.947] DOWN, THEY WILL HAVE TO PUNT
[ct=4180.405] THIS AWAY, BUT HEYWARD HAD
[ct=4180.643] DIFFERENT IDEAS.
[ct=4182.689] FIRST, THE ATHLETICISM THERE,
[ct=4183.980] THEN THE POWER TO BOUNCE OFF OF
[ct=4185.582] THAT THEN THE AWARENESS TO GET
[ct=4185.962] THE BALL ACROSS.
[ct=4188.555] AL: JOHN'S LOOKING AT THE
[ct=4189.333] LICENSE PLATE ON
[ct=4190.510] TRUCK.
[ct=4192.008] FIRST DOWN FROM THE 40-YARD
[ct=4201.073] TACKLING, HARRIS MIGHT'VE BEEN A
[ct=4203.859] TWO-YARD LOSS, SEVEN YARD GAIN.
[ct=4204.454] DOUG ARE MAKING THE TACKLE.
[ct=4207.544] KIRK: LOOKS LIKE JENNINGS HAD
[ct=4208.387] IT, THEN DUGGER.
[ct=4210.868] THAT’
[ct=4211.813] THAT'S WHAT NAJEE HARRIS BRINGS
[ct=4212.723] TO THIS OFFENSE IS THAT
[ct=4213.009] PHYSICALITY.
[ct=4216.191] A BIT MORE EXPLOSIVE.
[ct=4218.808] THIS YEAR, HE IS 11 RUNS OVER 15
[ct=4219.386] YARDS OR MORE.
[ct=4224.170] IN 21 AND 2022 HAD 16, SO HE HAS
[ct=4225.838] BEEN ABLE TO STRETCH THINGS OUT.
[ct=4227.814] THAT TIME, IT WAS ALL ABOUT
[ct=4229.325] THOSE TACKLES.
[ct=4232.249] AL: WARREN BACK IN THERE.
[ct=4237.088] FLIP IT TO WARREN.
[ct=4240.515] AND WARREN TAKES IT ACROSS THE
[ct=4242.146] 15 TO THE 4-YARD LINE.
[ct=4245.226] OF THE PATRIOTS.
[ct=4249.164] BRYANT MAKES A TACKLE, FIRST
[ct=4249.390] DOWN STEELERS.
[ct=4252.290] KIRK: MUCH LIKE WE THOUGHT THE
[ct=4253.601] END OF THE FIRST HALF ON THAT
[ct=4254.790] DRIVE THAT LED TO TOUCHDOWN,
[ct=4259.708] COUPLE REVERSES, SOME
[ct=4261.594] SCREENS, GET THE BALL TO WARREN
[ct=4261.594] OUT IN SPACE.
[ct=4266.266] ALMOST GOT AHEAD OF HIS LINEMEN
[ct=4268.618] BUT PUT THE BRAKES ON, LET THEM
[ct=4268.789] GET OUT IN FRONT OF HIM.
[ct=4280.387] AL: WARREN, STACKED UP.
[ct=4283.201] LAWRENCE GUY IS RIGHT THERE.
[ct=4286.641] GUY IN HIS 13TH YEAR IN THE
[ct=4287.161] LEAGUE.
[ct=4287.513] SECOND AND LONG.
[ct=4290.457] KIRK: ANOTHER GUY THAT YOU DON'T
[ct=4291.757] THINK MUCH OF, BUT THESE
[ct=4294.766] DEFENSIVE LINEMEN, USUALLY YOU
[ct=4297.864] THINK ABOUT THESE GUYS AT 3, 4,
[ct=4299.083] THEY WILL EAT UP THESE LINEMEN.
[ct=4301.236] LOOK HOW HE USES HIS HANDS AND
[ct=4302.837] GETS OFF THE BLOCKS.
[ct=4305.060] THAT'S A THING OF BEAUTY.
[ct=4305.651] USUALLY, BIG DEFENSIVE LINEMAN,
[ct=4308.520] THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO KEEP
[ct=4310.260] THOSE LINEBACKERS FREE, BUT
[ct=4311.355] ROTATING IN, STAYING FRESH.
[ct=4316.625] AL: CAME OVER FROM BALTIMORE SIX
[ct=4317.367] YEARS AGO.
[ct=4319.322] 13TH SEASON IN THE LEAGUE FOR
[ct=4319.932] LAWRENCE GUY.
[ct=4320.966] SECOND DOWN AND EIGHT.
[ct=4323.871] THAT PASS DANGEROUS AND
[ct=4325.729] MYLES BRYANT WAS THERE.
[ct=4327.771] OVER THE TOP OF ALLEN ROBINSON.
[ct=4330.385] THIRD DOWN AND EIGHT NOW.
[ct=4333.424] KIRK: I DO LIKE MYLES BRYANT WAS
[ct=4336.792] IN THE OFFENSIVE HUDDLE,
[ct=4337.256] FOURTH-YEAR PLAYER OUT OF
[ct=4338.629] WASHINGTON, THESE TWO ARE RIGHT
[ct=4341.020] IN THE SLOT AND HE JUMPS THIS.
[ct=4341.552] HE JUMPED OUT BEFORE THE BALL
[ct=4342.394] EVEN GOT OUT.
[ct=4343.499] HE IS SIMPLY READING ALLEN
[ct=4345.067] ROBINSON.
[ct=4346.288] DOESN'T FEEL ANY THREAT AT ALL
[ct=4348.968] ALLEN ROBINSON IS EITHER
[ct=4349.802] BLOCKING OR EVERYTHING IS
[ct=4351.649] UNDERNEATH, THAT'S WHY HE
[ct=4352.982] YOU A CUSHION.
[ct=4355.100] BUT GREAT QUICK REACTION ALLOWS
[ct=4357.002] HIM TO GET IN THERE AND SEPARATE
[ct=4357.413] THAT FOOTBALL.
[ct=4368.092] AL: SEND IN AN EXTRA MAN AND
[ct=4370.154] THEY GET SACKED BACK AT THE
[ct=4370.154] 49-YARD LINE.
[ct=4374.322] BRYAN AND DUGGER BOTH COMING IN.
[ct=4378.120] THEY BLOCKED DUGGER OUT OF WHAT
[ct=4380.093] WAS THE TOUCHDOWN PASS BEFORE.
[ct=4380.093] NOT THIS TIME, FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=4383.192] KIRK: THEY ARE MIXING UP THEIR
[ct=4384.759] LOOKS, DOING IT MOSTLY ON THE
[ct=4385.844] THIRD DOWN PLAYS.
[ct=4388.935] CONFUSED HIM, TAKEAWAYS, PRIMARY
[ct=4390.866] OFF TO THE LEFT HE DOESN'T HAVE
[ct=4391.354] AN ANSWER.
[ct=4393.201] YOU CAN SEE HOW COMFORTABLE HE
[ct=4395.205] WAS WITH HIS HIGH, ONCE HE GOT
[ct=4397.004] OFF HIS PRIMARY REED WHICH WAS
[ct=4398.228] TAKEN AWAY EYES WENT DOWN, NO
[ct=4398.228] ANSWER.
[ct=4403.822] AL: TO BOOTVIDEO.
[ct=4407.120] BEAUTIFUL SHOT OF DOWNTOWN
[ct=4409.409] PITTSBURGH ON A 44 DEGREE
[ct=4412.200] WIND NOT A FACTOR.
[ct=4416.923] ZAPPE THROWS, CAUGHT ELLIOT
[ct=4417.415] TACKLED IN THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=4422.887] ZZEKE HAVING A NICE NIGHT WITH A
[ct=4424.467] 16-YARD GAIN.
[ct=4424.803] RHAMONDRE STEVENSON IS THEIR
[ct=4427.281] NUMBER ONE BACK, BUT HE IS HURT.
[ct=4428.374] HE IS OUT AT LEAST TONIGHT AND
[ct=4429.543] WE WILL SEE WHETHER HE PLAYS
[ct=4430.874] AGAIN IN THEIR NEXT GAME IN 10
[ct=4430.874] DAYS.
[ct=4433.742] MEANWHILE, ZEKE SHOWING A LOT OF
[ct=4434.717] WHAT HE SHOWED IN DALLAS.
[ct=4438.660] NOW YOU HAVE GOT KEEANU BENTON,
[ct=4440.367] THE RICKY OUT OF WISCONSIN WHO
[ct=4442.543] HAS BEEN A FORCE OF LATE WHO IS
[ct=4442.543] DOWN ON THE GRASS.
[ct=4453.230] WITH THE WORDS FOR PICKENS
[ct=4453.517] AFTER THE BREAK.
[ct=4456.226] KIRK: HE'S COMMUNICATING HOW
[ct=4456.899] IMPORTANT IT IS TO SHOW MATURITY
[ct=4459.775] AND KEEP FIGHTING AND BE PART OF
[ct=4461.190] WHAT THIS OFFENSE IS TRYING TO
[ct=4461.190] DO.
[ct=4462.923] EVERYBODY IS FRUSTRATED, YOU
[ct=4463.757] HAVE TO FIGHT THROUGH IT.
[ct=4467.068] AL: PICKENS TONIGHT STORING ONE
[ct=4469.659] ON TARGET, FOUR YARDS AND THREE.
[ct=4474.240] RUSHED TO 36, ZAPPE THROWS,
[ct=4474.598] KNOCKED DOWN AND A FLAG DOWN.
[ct=4478.734] KIRK: MCDERMOTT, LEFT TACKLE
[ct=4479.212] HOLDING ON NATE HERBIG.
[ct=4487.621] REFEREE: HOLDING, OFFENSE NUMBER
[ct=4489.291] 75, 10-YARD PENALTY.
[ct=4489.793] REPLAY FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4494.090] AL: TRENT BROWN IS THEIR NUMBER
[ct=4498.359] ONE GUY, BUT MISSED THREE GAMES
[ct=4498.359] THIS YEAR.
[ct=4502.846] HERBIG HAS A BIG ROLE TONIGHT
[ct=4503.633] WITH ALEX HIGHSMITH NOW FOR THE
[ct=4503.862] REST OF THE GAME.
[ct=4507.105] THE ROOKIE OUT OF WISCONSIN HAS
[ct=4507.647] GREAT TWITCH.
[ct=4510.113] BIT OF A BETWEEN HER COMING OUT,
[ct=4513.042] HE IS SIX FOOT TWO ABOUT 240 BUT
[ct=4514.914] HE WORKS VERY HARD WITH T.J.
[ct=4519.105] WATT, ANOTHER HARD WORKER.
[ct=4520.125] HE HAS ALWAYS STUDIED T.J. WATT.
[ct=4522.851] AL: FIRST AND 20.
[ct=4527.267] ELLIOTT MAKES THE GRAB, COASTS
[ct=4527.267] TO THE INSIDE.
[ct=4529.625] OUT TO THE 34 GOES ZEKE.
[ct=4533.100] YOU MENTIONED AS A ROOKIE LEAD
[ct=4535.177] THE LEAGUE IN RUSHING, LED IN
[ct=4535.720] RUSHING HIS THIRD YEAR.
[ct=4537.267] STELLAR CAREER.
[ct=4541.414] THE NIGHT HE JUMPED INTO THE
[ct=4541.966] SALVATION ARMY BARREL ON THE
[ct=4542.414] SUNDAY NIGHT GAME.
[ct=4544.388] I JUST CAN'T FORGET IT.
[ct=4547.609] KIRK: BIG PERSONALITY, GREAT TO
[ct=4548.540] SEE HIM GET THIS OPPORTUNITY
[ct=4552.152] THEY HAVE NOT RUN THE FOOTBALL
[ct=4552.913] TONIGHT WITH ZEKE ELLIOTT.
[ct=4554.384] NOT ABLE TO RUN IT WELL.
[ct=4557.227] BUT HE DOES HAVE SIX CATCHES.
[ct=4558.251] THEY ARE FINDING WAYS TO GET HIS
[ct=4558.510] HANDS ON THE BALL.
[ct=4562.552] AL: 85 YARDS FROM SCRIMMAGE.
[ct=4562.952] SECOND DOWN AND 12.
[ct=4565.024] THERE HE GOES AGAIN.
[ct=4570.819] WENT UP AND OVER THE 2000 CARRY
[ct=4573.476] MARK IN HIS CAREER IN THE FIRST
[ct=4574.467] HE WILL MAKE A THIRD DOWN AND
[ct=4575.071] ABOUT SEVEN.
[ct=4579.306] KIRK: TO GO BACK TO WHAT BAILEY
[ct=4580.494] ZAPPE AND TRUBISKY, WE TALKED
[ct=4584.062] ABOUT THIS BEING AN IMPORTANT
[ct=4585.037] ASPECT OF THIS GAME IS NOT JUST
[ct=4586.311] PLAYING LIKE ZAPPE HAS MAKING
[ct=4588.731] PLAYS, BUT GETTING IN YOUR OWN
[ct=4589.079] TERRITORY AVOIDING THAT
[ct=4589.545] TURNOVER.
[ct=4592.704] TRUBISKY THREW ONE, GAVE THE
[ct=4594.325] PATRIOTS GREAT FIELD POSITION,
[ct=4595.800] ENDED UP CATCHING IT FOR A
[ct=4597.512] ZAPPE WAS IN THE ZONE IN THE
[ct=4597.817] FIRST HALF.
[ct=4599.573] LET'S SEE WHAT HE DOES WITH THIS
[ct=4600.049] OPPORTUNITY ON THIRD DOWN.
[ct=4604.224] AL: ZAPPE IS 0 FOR 220 AND 3
[ct=4608.901] THIRD AND SEVEN, HANGING IN BUT
[ct=4609.213] NOT FOR LONG.
[ct=4612.714] CAN HEYWARD, WHO HAS BEEN
[ct=4614.661] RELATIVELY QUIET TONIGHT, BUT
[ct=4615.710] SPECTACULAR CAREER IN HIS 13TH
[ct=4618.974] SEASON OUT OF OHIO STATE PICKED
[ct=4621.162] HIM NUMBER ONE BACK IN 2011,
[ct=4621.579] GETS THE STACK HERE.
[ct=4625.445] KIRK: HOW GREAT TO SEE NUMBER 97
[ct=4626.972] GOT GOING UP AGAINST THE ROOKIE
[ct=4627.987] RIGHT GUARD AND WORKS THROUGH
[ct=4630.251] HE HAS SUCH GREAT STRENGTH WITH
[ct=4630.656] THAT BULRUSH.
[ct=4633.338] GOOD COVERAGE DOWNFIELD FREES
[ct=4634.366] HIM UP TO GET HOME.
[ct=4637.631] AL: ROOKIE BRYCE BARINGER.
[ct=4643.458] SENDS IT TOWARD THE NEAR SIDE
[ct=4644.376] LINE AND BOUNCES OUT OF BOUNDS
[ct=4647.747] NEAR THE PITTSBURGH BENCH AND
[ct=4648.812] THEY WILL SPOT THE BALL AT THE A
[ct=4652.314] THEY KNOW, THEY DON'T KNOW.
[ct=4652.314] EXCEPT FOR MAYBE THOSE GUYS.
[ct=4657.288] BUT THE OPTIONS ARE MANIFOLD
[ct=4657.747] GOING INTO NEXT SEASON.
[ct=4662.280] DOES HE COME BACK TO COACH THE
[ct=4664.895] TEAM AGAIN NEXT YEAR IS ONE WAY.
[ct=4666.946] MEANWHILE, TRUBISKY THROWS HERE.
[ct=4669.067] SHORT PASS CAUGHT BY PICKENS
[ct=4678.332] DOES ANOTHER TEAM HIGHER HIM,
[ct=4678.647] AND THEN A TRADE IS AFFECTED,
[ct=4680.337] THAT'S THE WAY HE CAME TO NEW
[ct=4682.292] ENGLAND IN A TRADE WITH THE JETS
[ct=4683.499] BACK IN 2003 DOES HE GET FIRED?
[ct=4687.013] I SAY THE CHANCES OF BETTER ARE
[ct=4687.013] 0.2%.
[ct=4692.358] DOES HE GO INTO TELEVISION?
[ct=4693.241] YOU KNOW HOW CRAZY THAT SOUNDS,
[ct=4695.509] BUT HE WON AN EMMY ON THAT BEST
[ct=4696.898] OF 100 SHOW.
[ct=4700.661] RICH EISEN DID A FANTASTIC JOB.
[ct=4702.323] SECOND DOWN AND FIVE HERE.
[ct=4704.956] THE TOSS BACK HERE.
[ct=4707.727] KIRK: THE ONLY GUY THAT KNOWS
[ct=4708.257] HIS BILL BELICHICK.
[ct=4710.276] AL: ROBERT KRAFT WOULD HAVE TO
[ct=4710.512] KNOW.
[ct=4715.787] HOW ABOUT THIS? IF HE GOES INTO
[ct=4716.282] TELEVISION, THEY PUT HIM IN THE
[ct=4718.313] BOOTH WITH TOM BURKART AND TOM
[ct=4719.551] BRADY NEXT YEAR ON FOX.
[ct=4722.737] MORGAN GOES ON TO HER WITH JON
[ct=4724.056] BON JOVI, SO WE HAVE ALL THESE
[ct=4726.122] POSSIBILITIES AND NOBODY KNOWS
[ct=4726.498] RIGHT NOW.
[ct=4728.686] KIRK: YOU ARE THROWING THEM ALL
[ct=4729.089] OUT RIGHT NOW.
[ct=4730.890] AL: TAKE YOUR PICK.
[ct=4733.709] KIRK: WITH TOM BRADY, THAT WOULD
[ct=4733.932] BE FUN.
[ct=4738.060] AL: JIM AND THOSE GUYS A BUNCH
[ct=4738.623] OF YEARS BACK IN BASEBALL.
[ct=4742.152] KIRK: HE DID A GREAT JOB WHEN HE
[ct=4742.967] DID BEST STUDIO SHOW WITH CHRIS.
[ct=4748.787] AL: THIRD DOWN AND SIXTH.
[ct=4753.108] ONE-HANDED CATCH WHAT SORT OF A
[ct=4753.108] FIRST DOWN BY PLENTY.
[ct=4755.821] JONATHAN JONES MAKES THE STOP.
[ct=4756.937] THIS WILL BE THE ONGOING SAGA IN
[ct=4764.899] ANOTHER TEAM THAT WANTS HIM, IT
[ct=4766.036] HAS TO BE A RELATIVELY
[ct=4766.036] SHORT-TERM SITUATION.
[ct=4769.702] YOU HAVE TO BUILD A NEW STAFF
[ct=4770.046] BASICALLY.
[ct=4773.260] KIRK: I THINK THE BIGGEST
[ct=4774.884] QUESTION THAT HE HAS TO ANSWER
[ct=4777.514] HIMSELF IS, DOES HE STILL HAVE
[ct=4777.849] THE FIRE?
[ct=4780.527] DOES HE STILL WAKE UP AND HAVE
[ct=4781.191] THAT COMPETITIVE FIRE?
[ct=4784.704] NOBODY, AGAIN, KNOWS THAT EXCEPT
[ct=4784.965] HIMSELF.
[ct=4790.492] AL: CAUGHT AT THE 31-YARD LINE
[ct=4790.492] BY MYLES BRYANT.
[ct=4792.904] YOU LOOK AT HIS CAREER
[ct=4792.904] ACCOMPLISHMENTS.
[ct=4796.645] OF COURSE, TONS OF THEM.
[ct=4799.332] 300 REGULAR SEASON WINS, 31
[ct=4799.332] POSTSEASON
[ct=4800.759] CHAMPIONSHIPS AS YOU KNOW.
[ct=4804.055] THE LOMBARDI'S 11 STRAIGHT
[ct=4804.290] DIVISION TITLES.
[ct=4807.097] TOOK OVER IN 2000.
[ct=4808.087] HE WAS GOING TO BECOME THE HEAD
[ct=4810.699] COACH OF THE NEW YORK JETS.
[ct=4811.302] THAT FAMOUS PRESS CONFERENCE
[ct=4812.724] WHERE HE LEFT HIS NOTE ON THE
[ct=4812.974] TABLE IN THE PODIUM.
[ct=4816.982] NOT GOING TO BE THE HC OF THE
[ct=4818.377] NYJ.
[ct=4821.359] KRAFT HAD TO GIVE UP THE
[ct=4822.929] ONE PICK FOR HIM.
[ct=4823.254] THEN HE WAS OFF TO THE RACES.
[ct=4825.508] KIRK: THE BIGGEST THING WE HAVE
[ct=4826.455] LEARNED THESE LAST FEW YEARS
[ct=4829.097] WITH TOM BRADY MOVING ON.
[ct=4831.199] AS GOOD AS BILL BELICHICK IS,
[ct=4833.365] YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET ANOTHER
[ct=4834.604] TOM BRADY, BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE
[ct=4835.364] A DIFFERENCE MAKER AT THAT
[ct=4837.183] POSITION TO GIVE YOURSELF
[ct=4839.340] A CHANCE TO BE COMPETITIVE.
[ct=4843.552] AL: OUR PREGAME DREW HAD A GREAT
[ct=4843.552] CONVERSATION.
[ct=4847.063] A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING BELICHICK
[ct=4847.524] IS NOTHING WITHOUT BRADY.
[ct=4848.622] THAT'S TOTAL NONSENSE.
[ct=4852.879] THEY WERE A HELL OF A TEAM.
[ct=4857.534] KIRK: IT IS LIKE BILL WALSH AND
[ct=4857.750] JOE MONTANA.
[ct=4859.984] BILL WALSH WAS OUTSTANDING.
[ct=4860.990] HE WAS VERY GOOD WHEN JOE
[ct=4863.369] MONTANA WAS BACK THERE AND STEVE
[ct=4863.396] YOUNG.
[ct=4863.719] IT WORKS HAND-IN-HAND.
[ct=4867.241] AL: SECOND AND THREE.
[ct=4874.445] AND ELLIOTT WILL SET UP ANOTHER
[ct=4875.048] DOWN AND SHORT.
[ct=4879.462] KIRK: IF THERE IS ONE AREA YOU
[ct=4880.902] WILL CRITIQUE, IT'S NOT THE
[ct=4882.042] FOOTBALL COACH, WHAT HE DOES, IT
[ct=4884.098] IS PUTTING THE ROSTER TOGETHER,
[ct=4884.927] WHAT THEY HAVE DONE THESE L
[ct=4885.566] TWO YEARS.
[ct=4888.660] THAT'S THE ASPECT IF YOU WILL
[ct=4888.660] REALLY CRITIQUE AND LOOK AT NEW
[ct=4891.041] ENGLAND AND SAY THEY CAN GET
[ct=4891.041] BETTER.
[ct=4892.314] THAT'S THE OBVIOUS AREA THAT
[ct=4892.927] JUMPS OUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE
[ct=4893.801] DRAFT PICKS.
[ct=4897.305] AL: LOOK, HE GOT ALL OF THE
[ct=4899.162] POWER AFTER HE WON THAT THIRD
[ct=4899.559] SUPER BOWL.
[ct=4901.619] IT WAS THE COACH, EVEN THOUGH HE
[ct=4903.340] HAD OTHER GUYS IN THE OFFICE WHO
[ct=4903.825] WERE IMPORTANT.
[ct=4906.928] NIKOS AREA, BERNIE ADAMS AND
[ct=4906.928] OTHER PEOPLE.
[ct=4907.616] IT WAS BILL WHO MADE THE
[ct=4908.355] ULTIMATE DECISIONS.
[ct=4912.749] THIRD AND TWO.
[ct=4916.592] THAT WILL BE A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=4921.330] JUST TO PUT A BALL ON IT, DOES
[ct=4921.575] HE GO SOMEPLACE ELSE,,
[ct=4925.273] HE GO SOMEPLACE ELSE, FOR IT
[ct=4925.273] WILL BUILD JUST SAY YOU KNOW
[ct=4926.670] TEAMS?
[ct=4929.985] KIRK: ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, IF HE
[ct=4931.801] COMES BACK, HE WILL PROBABLY GO
[ct=4933.018] AND BUY A QUARTERBACK.
[ct=4935.150] DO THEY GO AND TRY TO FIND A
[ct=4935.150] QUARTERBACK ALREADY IN THE
[ct=4935.759] LEAGUE?
[ct=4938.720] DO THEY GO OUT WITH THE DRAFT.
[ct=4940.601] A LOT OF BIG NAMES COMING OUT
[ct=4941.458] WITH THE DRAFT THIS YEAR THAT
[ct=4942.319] ARE VERY CAPABLE.
[ct=4942.783] BUT YOU ARE STARTING OVER WITH
[ct=4944.910] ANOTHER ROOKIE QUARTERBACK.
[ct=4948.160] IT WILL BE AN INTERESTING
[ct=4948.670] OFF-SEASON WITH NEW ENGLAND AND
[ct=4949.628] EVERYTHING IN FRONT OF THEM.
[ct=4953.533] AL: ZAPPE, BROKEN UP,
[ct=4955.387] INTERCEPTED!
[ct=4958.487] FITZPATRICK WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF
[ct=4962.037] MEANWHILE, THAT IS WALKER, MYKAL
[ct=4963.908] WALKER WITH THE INTERCEPTION.
[ct=4969.333] TAKING IT DOWN DEEP INTO NEW
[ct=4969.333] ENGLAND TERRITORY.
[ct=4974.619] KIRK: THEY HAVE ATTACKED THESE
[ct=4976.395] THIS TIME IT IS ROBERTS WHO
[ct=4977.752] LOOKS LIKE HE GETS INVOLVED
[ct=4979.367] NUMBER 50.
[ct=4980.316] TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A PLAY ON THE
[ct=4981.263] BALL.
[ct=4985.783] HE ATTACKED THIS AREA MOST O
[ct=4986.267] THIS GAME.
[ct=4989.004] GOOD JOB BY ROBERTS WHO IS KNOWN
[ct=4989.681] MORE FOR HIS FIRST AND SECOND
[ct=4992.562] DOWN PLAY BUT THIS TIME AGAINST
[ct=4992.799] DUE SMITH HE IS ABLE TO GET HIS
[ct=4995.950] HAND IN AND NOT THAT BALL THESE.
[ct=4998.582] HE GETS UP IN THE AIR SO IF YOU
[ct=4999.614] GO IN THAT REGION THIS TIME, IT
[ct=5003.810] ENDS UP PAYING FOR THE STEELERS.
[ct=5004.302] GOOD HEADS UP PLAY.
[ct=5005.737] WE TALKED ABOUT THESE
[ct=5005.737] QUARTERBACKS.
[ct=5009.067] DON'T MAKE DISASTROUS PLAY IN
[ct=5009.516] YOUR OWN TERRITORY.
[ct=5010.976] PATRIOTS HAVE DONE THAT RIGHT
[ct=5011.421] HERE WITH ZAPPE.
[ct=5015.807] AL: WALKER, FOURTH YEAR OUT OF
[ct=5015.807] FRESNO STATE.
[ct=5018.723] PICKED HIM UP AS A FREE AGENT
[ct=5022.001] MAKES THE PLAY THAT CAN PUT THEM
[ct=5022.461] RIGHT BACK INTO THE GAME.
[ct=5025.548] AFTER A ONE-YARD CARRY HERE.
[ct=5030.326] GODCHAUX MAKES THE TACKLE HERE.
[ct=5033.414] FINAL MINUTE OF THE THIRD
[ct=5037.464] KIRK: THIS FIRST HALF WHEN THEY
[ct=5039.144] WERE DOWN 21-3, WE SAID WHERE IS
[ct=5039.674] THE LEADERSHIP?
[ct=5043.080] THIS IS A TEAM THAT IS 7-5 IN
[ct=5045.295] THE THICK OF THINGS IN AN AFC
[ct=5046.743] WILD CARD RACE.
[ct=5048.221] THEY ARE NOT PLAYING LIKE THAT
[ct=5048.857] AFTER A TOUGH GAME LAST WEEK
[ct=5049.756] AGAINST THE CARDINALS.
[ct=5050.576] GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR GIVING
[ct=5051.996] THEMSELVES A CHANCE.
[ct=5053.530] NOW CAN THEY CAPITALIZE AND INTO
[ct=5053.839] THE END ZONE?
[ct=5057.891] AL: SECOND AND NINE.
[ct=5062.503] GOOD COVERAGE AS WELL BY THE
[ct=5062.989] SECONDARY.
[ct=5064.641] HE HAS TO FLIP IT AWAY.
[ct=5070.908] BOOS RAIN DOWN AGAIN.
[ct=5072.554] THIRD AND NINE.
[ct=5082.711] KIRK: GOOD PROTECTION.
[ct=5083.819] BETTER COVERAGE DOWNFIELD.
[ct=5084.737] ALL YOU CAN DO IS THROW IT AWAY.
[ct=5087.327] HERE THEY GO, BIG THIRD DOWN.
[ct=5089.369] ONLY HIT THREE OF 10 SO FAR.
[ct=5095.890] AL: TRUBISKY HAS THROWN FOR ONLY
[ct=5096.616] 92 YARDS.
[ct=5100.497] ON 12 OF 19.
[ct=5103.527] THIRD DOWN AND NINE.
[ct=5108.519] PRESSURE FROM BEHIND.
[ct=5109.092] HE'S GOING TO RUN.
[ct=5111.676] TRUBISKY LOOKING FOR THE FIRST
[ct=5112.332] DOWN BUT CAUGHT A LITTLE BIT
[ct=5112.332] SHORT.
[ct=5115.055] STARTS TO SLIDE A COUPLE
[ct=5116.601] BENTLEY IS THERE.
[ct=5122.995] AND A FOURTH AND TWO TO BEGIN
[ct=5124.616] THE FOURTH PERIOD.
[ct=5127.726] END OF THREE IN PITTSBURGH.
[ct=5129.173] 21-10, NEW ENGLAND.
[ct=5136.865] GO FOR IT,
[ct=5138.072] KICK IT, AND THEY ARE GOING TO
[ct=5138.072] GO FOR IT.
[ct=5141.205] HAD HIS HELMET ON ON THE
[ct=5141.659] SIDELINES.
[ct=5143.924] RIGHT FROM THE GET-GO, THEY WILL
[ct=5144.393] GO FOR IT ON FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=5148.031] AND A LONG TWO.
[ct=5156.468] TRUBISKY, DANCING, FLIPS IT AND
[ct=5158.923] IT'S GOING TO BE SHORT OF A
[ct=5161.121] FIRST DOWN AND THEY WILL TURN
[ct=5161.121] THE BALL OVERPAID HE FLIPPED IT
[ct=5162.645] TO WARREN.
[ct=5165.584] NEEDED TWO YARDS, GOT ONE.
[ct=5167.427] PATRIOTS TAKEOVER, YOU HAVE GOT
[ct=5168.261] MACK WILSON IN ON THE STOP.
[ct=5172.241] KIRK: THE PATRIOTS KNOW THIS IS
[ct=5173.881] THE TARGET WHEN THEY GET DOWN TO
[ct=5174.100] THIS AREA.
[ct=5176.644] WATCH WHAT THEY DO TO FREIERMUTH
[ct=5178.799] YOU HAVE TWO GUYS, ONE OF THEM
[ct=5179.280] HITS HIM.
[ct=5181.121] BENTLEY, HE BREAKS FREE, BUT
[ct=5185.594] BY THE TIME HE SEES HIM IT
[ct=5186.379] IS TOO LATE.
[ct=5187.572] HE FLIPS IT TO WARREN BECAUSE OF
[ct=5189.706] THAT RECOGNITION BY
[ct=5191.064] BENTLEY.
[ct=5191.876] GOOD JOB ANTICIPATING THE BIG
[ct=5192.922] TIGHT END AS THE TARGET.
[ct=5194.664] TOOK HIM AWAY, AND YOU SEE THE
[ct=5196.025] FRUSTRATION FOR THE STEELERS.
[ct=5198.860] AL: WILSON RIGHT THERE AS WELL.
[ct=5200.507] SO THEY GET THE BALL BACK AT
[ct=5200.987] THEIR OWN SEVEN-YARD LINE.
[ct=5210.463] TOMLIN ROLLING THE DICE.
[ct=5216.089] AND CRAPPING OUT ON THAT ONE.
[ct=5219.645] DOWN BY 11, PASS ON THE OUTSIDE,
[ct=5220.813] SHORT AGAIN.
[ct=5225.199] THORNTON MAKES THE CATCH.
[ct=5226.580] PATRICK PETERSON, 13TH YEAR IN
[ct=5229.469] THE LEAGUE, BEEN AROUND LONG
[ct=5229.713] TIME, ARIZONA AND
[ct=5232.292] RECENTLY, WITH THE STOP.
[ct=5235.830] KIRK: THE BIGGER PLAY ZEKE
[ct=5238.703] ELLIOTT HAS MADE TONIGHT WAS ON
[ct=5238.703] THAT INTERCESSION WHERE HE
[ct=5241.234] HUSTLED AND PREVENTED PITTSBURGH
[ct=5243.365] FROM GETTING IN THE END ZONE ON
[ct=5243.607] THAT INTERCEPTION.
[ct=5245.547] CHASED IT DOWN AND HUSTLED.
[ct=5249.585] FORCED THE STEELERS OFFENSE ONTO
[ct=5249.792] THE FIELD.
[ct=5252.792] AL: SECOND AND SEVEN.
[ct=5257.079] ELLIOTT OVER THE RIGHT SIDE.
[ct=5257.308] 30 AND TWO.
[ct=5260.221] KIRK: GO BACK TO THAT
[ct=5261.842] THE INTERCEPTION.
[ct=5262.659] IT WAS A GOOD PLAY.
[ct=5264.082] WE TALKED ABOUT ROBERTS MAKING A
[ct=5266.163] PLAY TO DEFLECT IT.
[ct=5266.946] WALKER GETS THE TIP.
[ct=5270.254] HUSTLED DOWN FIELD, IF HE
[ct=5271.519] DOESN'T MAKE THAT PLAY, HE GOES
[ct=5272.157] INTO THE END ZONE.
[ct=5274.920] SO, GOOD JOB COMING UP WITH THAT
[ct=5275.399] DEFENSE STEPS UP.
[ct=5281.967] AL: ZEKE GETTING THE OPPORTUNITY
[ct=5282.501] WITH AN INJURY TO STEPHENSON.
[ct=5284.624] AND MAKING THE VERY MOST OF IT.
[ct=5288.159] YOU'RE RIGHT, THAT TACKLE SAYING
[ct=5288.665] IT WOULD'VE BEEN A TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=5289.970] THIRD DOWN AND TWO.
[ct=5291.623] FROM THE 15 YARD LINE.
[ct=5296.977] ZAPPE FLUSHED OUT.
[ct=5298.692] GOING TO THROWN THE RUN ALONG
[ct=5300.209] THE SIDELINE, AND THAT IS
[ct=5301.595] THORNTON WHO IS THERE.
[ct=5305.298] AND IT'S INCOMPLETE.
[ct=5309.046] SO, FROM DEEP IN THEIR OWN
[ct=5309.317] TERRITORY, THEY WILL PUNTED BACK
[ct=5310.180] TO THE STEELERS.
[ct=5313.895] KIRK: THERE'S THIS BEEN MOVE
[ct=5314.265] FROM T.J. WATT ON THE OUTSIDE
[ct=5315.231] BACK TO THE INSIDE.
[ct=5315.473] FLUSHES HIM.
[ct=5319.280] ZAPPE, DON'T MAKE THAT CRITICAL
[ct=5321.029] ERROR, ALMOST DOES IT AGAIN.
[ct=5321.995] THERE IS BEHIND HIM LATE.
[ct=5325.966] THE LOOK HOW CLOSE THAT WAS
[ct=5326.399] NEVER AN INTERCEPTION.
[ct=5328.435] AL: AND THE KICK IS GOING TO BE
[ct=5328.755] BLOCKED.
[ct=5336.085] THEIR SPECIAL TEAMS MAVEN GETS
[ct=5336.312] IN THERE.
[ct=5338.422] THAT'S GOING TO SET PITTSBURGH
[ct=5338.422] UP.
[ct=5342.341] P AT AROUND THE 25-YARD LINE.
[ct=5348.711] KIRK: EVER SINCE THE TOUCHDOWN
[ct=5349.319] AT THE END OF THE FIRST HALF,
[ct=5351.574] THE STEELERS HAVE COME ALIVE.
[ct=5354.029] THEY HAVE TO CAPITALIZE ON THE
[ct=5355.281] OPPORTUNITIES.
[ct=5356.303] THEY MISSED IT AFTER THE
[ct=5357.381] GOOD HUSTLE PLAY RIGHT HERE.
[ct=5359.919] BOUNCES RIGHT OFF HIS CHEST.
[ct=5363.603] AND THE STEELERS ARE GOING TO
[ct=5363.900] GET OUTSTANDING FIELD POSITION.
[ct=5373.849] AL: THE SPECIAL TEAMS ACE,
[ct=5375.058] AL: THE SPECIAL TEAMS ACE.
[ct=5378.341] FALSE KIDS OUT TO THE 26-YARD
[ct=5383.534] 1330 BAM TO PLAY IN
[ct=5391.296] AL: YOU WOULD THINK AT SOME
[ct=5394.139] POINT, HAVEN'T DONE IT YET.
[ct=5396.946] THERE HE IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
[ct=5402.455] STACKED RECEIVERS KEEP IT ON THE
[ct=5403.063] GROUND HERE.
[ct=5403.494] NICE RUN HERE.
[ct=5407.164] GAIN OF SIX.
[ct=5408.866] NAJEE HARRIS TO THE 20-YARD
[ct=5409.338] LINE, SECOND DOWN.
[ct=5412.495] KIRK: GREAT PUSH ON THAT DUAL
[ct=5413.603] BLOCK DOUBLE-TEAMED TO THE
[ct=5414.570] INSIDE, ABLE TO GET UP TO THOSE
[ct=5416.047] THEY HAVEN’
[ct=5416.585] THEY HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF
[ct=5420.534] SURGES INTO THAT PATRIOTS FRONT
[ct=5421.073] ESPECIALLY BETWEEN THE TACKLES.
[ct=5423.222] THAT TIME WE DID.
[ct=5425.143] VERY POSITIVE GAIN ON FIRST AND
[ct=5429.109] SQUANDERED THE OPPORTUNITY AFTER
[ct=5432.465] NOW ANOTHER GOOD OPPORTUNITY
[ct=5437.466] AL: IT WAS 21-3 AT ONE POINT.
[ct=5439.267] ANOTHER POINT GAIN RIGHT NOW.
[ct=5443.869] PITTSBURGH TRYING TO NARROW THE
[ct=5444.189] MARGIN.
[ct=5444.322] SECOND DOWN AND FOUR.
[ct=5446.821] PLAY-ACTION UNDER PRESSURE.
[ct=5451.701] GETS IT AWAY, CAUGHT AND DOWN
[ct=5452.252] THE SIDELINE GOES DARNELL
[ct=5455.684] WASHINGTON THE BIG TIGHT END.
[ct=5459.796] 6'7", 264, HIS FIRST CATCH OF
[ct=5464.294] KIRK: REALLY BUILT LIKE A
[ct=5464.777] TACKLE.
[ct=5466.164] AT GEORGIA, HE WOULD GET HIS
[ct=5466.611] HANDS ON THE FOOTBALL.
[ct=5471.767] BUT WASHINGTON NOT KNOWN AS JUST
[ct=5472.146] BEING A BLOCKER.
[ct=5475.694] I BE SURPRISED IF THAT IS WHAT
[ct=5476.399] HE HAS BEEN DOING FOR
[ct=5478.711] PITTSBURGH'S OFFENSE, BUT TALK
[ct=5480.123] ABOUT A WEAPON DOWN THE RED
[ct=5483.032] 6'7" LIKE YOU SAID, 260 FOUR
[ct=5483.534] POUNDS AND CAN MOVE?
[ct=5489.241] AL: PITTSBURGH DRESSED FOUR
[ct=5489.489] TIGHT ENDS TONIGHT, HE IS ONE OF
[ct=5489.489] THEM.
[ct=5492.491] HEYWARD ANOTHER, HAS CAUGHT TWO.
[ct=5495.656] NOW YOU HAVE TO TAKE A TIMEOUT
[ct=5497.464] TO HIS CHAGRIN.
[ct=5502.765] I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, TONIGHT’S
[ct=5504.192] JOURNEY IS BEING PRESENTED BY
[ct=5508.380] KHYUNDAI.
[ct=5510.594] BAILEY ZAPPE WITH THREE
[ct=5511.308] TOUCHDOWNS IN THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=5518.114] THERE ARE HIS NUMBERS, 93 YARDS
[ct=5518.114] AND A LITTLE MORE THAN THREE
[ct=5518.363] QUARTERS.
[ct=5521.757] NOTHING MORE FOR T.J. WATT WHO
[ct=5522.475] WAS IN AND OUT OF THE MEDICAL
[ct=5523.498] TENT TONIGHT.
[ct=5526.080] NO SEX FOR HIM YET.
[ct=5534.572] K KIRK: WA HADT TO SHOW
[ct=5535.191] TOUGHNESS GETTING THROUGH THAT
[ct=5535.474] FIRST PLAY.
[ct=5537.572] TO GIVE CREDIT, THEYT HAVE DONE
[ct=5539.166] A GOOD JOB ON PASS PROTECTION.
[ct=5542.775] AL: THEY REPLACE THE
[ct=5543.444] COMMUNICATION SYSTEM I'M BEING
[ct=5545.908] TOLD IN TRUBISKY'S HELMET.
[ct=5552.433] THAT'S WHY THEY HAD TO TAKE
[ct=5554.497] THEIR TIMEOUT, WHICH IS VERY
[ct=5555.277] SIGNIFICANT IN THE SECOND HALF
[ct=5555.517] OF A CLOSE GAME.
[ct=5557.178] FIRST AND GOAL.
[ct=5569.465] TRUBISKY TO THE ENDZONE.
[ct=5572.400] THAT'S INCOMPLETE.
[ct=5573.041] FIRE MOVE COVERED BY JACKSON.
[ct=5577.819] -- FRIERMUTH COVERED BY JACKSON.
[ct=5582.757] KIRK: THIS IS WHAT MAKES
[ct=5583.610] FREIERMUTH SO EFFECTIVE IS HE
[ct=5586.578] CAN BE IN LINE TRADITIONAL TIGHT
[ct=5587.570] END, OR YOU CAN FLEX HIM OUT
[ct=5591.845] BECAUSE THE HAS THE SKILL SET TO
[ct=5591.845] RUN THESE ROUTES.
[ct=5595.422] REFEREE: THE BALL WAS PLACED AT
[ct=5597.515] THE ONE-YARD LINE.
[ct=5602.597] AL: JACKSON IS A MISMATCH AS FAR
[ct=5602.597] AS PHYSICALITY OUT IN SPACE.
[ct=5604.248] DOESN'T HAVE THE QUICKNESS BUT
[ct=5604.777] HE HAS THE SIZE.
[ct=5608.946] THAT WAS TOUGH FOR JACKSON WHO
[ct=5608.946] JUST GRABS ONTO IT.
[ct=5611.114] THORNTON COMES IN AS THE
[ct=5611.978] ELIGIBLE RECEIVER RIGHT NOW.
[ct=5615.111] THE TACKLE, FIRST DOWN AND GOAL.
[ct=5628.667] LOOK AT THIS, INCOMPLETE OF ALL
[ct=5630.944] CONNOR HEYWARD THROWING IT.
[ct=5635.138] WILSON IS THERE TO KNOCK IT
[ct=5636.161] THEY GO TO THE BACK OF THE
[ct=5636.473] PLAYBOOK.
[ct=5641.153] YOU TELL ME ON A FIRST AND GOAL.
[ct=5643.838] KIRK: THEY ARE TRYING TO GET
[ct=5645.681] CREATIVE WITH THIS IS IN THE
[ct=5647.829] PLACE FOR THIS GREAT TIGHT END
[ct=5649.377] THROWING A PASS ON FIRST AND
[ct=5650.534] GOAL AFTER PASS INTERFERENCE.
[ct=5651.295] WILSON ALMOST COMES DOWN WITH
[ct=5652.136] THAT IS COVERED DOWNFIELD AS
[ct=5652.691] WELL.
[ct=5656.163] YOU ARE AT THE ONE-YARD LINE,
[ct=5656.836] JUST POUND THE ROCK.
[ct=5660.002] AL: NO PITTSBURGH SPECIAL ON
[ct=5661.530] SECOND AND GOAL.
[ct=5663.207] GOING INTO THE END ZONE,
[ct=5667.813] TRUBISKY DOES IT HIMSELF.
[ct=5676.175] TOMLIN SAYS WE WILL GO FOR TWO
[ct=5677.814] TO MAKE IT A THREE-POINT GAME.
[ct=5684.324] KIRK: HECK OF A JOB ON THAT PLAY
[ct=5687.542] BY MASON BOWLES, WHO TOOK THE
[ct=5688.609] NOSE GUARD OUT.
[ct=5689.988] MADE IT EASY FOR TRUBISKY TO GO
[ct=5690.230] OVER THE TOP OF HIM.
[ct=5699.164] AL: TRYING TO SHAVE IT TO THE
[ct=5701.022] MARGIN OF A FIELD GOAL RIGHT
[ct=5702.835] NOW.
[ct=5703.686] TWO-POINT PLAY COMING UP.
[ct=5708.530] 11:44 LEFT IN THE FOURTH.
[ct=5718.474] PICKENS MOVES TO THE INSIDE.
[ct=5720.589] THE PASS IS CAUGHT.
[ct=5724.472] FREIERMUTH FOR THE TWO POINTS.
[ct=5731.012] TURNED AN 18-POINT DEFICIT INTO
[ct=5734.228] A THREE-POINT DEFICIT.
[ct=5734.228] BLOCKED KICK RIGHT THERE.
[ct=5740.152] AL: A STEALER TRADITION,
[ct=5741.746] "RENEGADE."
[ct=5744.801] A LOT TO YELL AND SNAP YOUR FEET
[ct=5749.795] ABOUT, ESPECIALLY TURNING AN
[ct=5750.326] 18-POINT DEFICIT INTO A
[ct=5750.326] THREE-POINT DEFICIT.
[ct=5754.322] KIRK: YOU LOOK AT THIS WIN
[ct=5755.025] PROBABILITY, LOOK AT OUR
[ct=5756.215] STATS POWERED BY AWS.
[ct=5758.873] THIS IS BEFORE AND AFTER THE
[ct=5760.664] BLOCKED PUNT.
[ct=5762.511] THIS TEAM HAS FOUGHT, PUT
[ct=5763.973] THEMSELVES INTO POSITION AFTER
[ct=5765.493] THE SCORE.
[ct=5769.810] 33%, HITS THE TWO-POINTER AND
[ct=5770.422] ALL OF A SUDDEN THE STADIUM IS
[ct=5770.645] ALIVE.
[ct=5771.703] THIS IS WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT.
[ct=5774.258] THIS IS WHAT MIKE TOMLIN TALKED
[ct=5775.077] ABOUT.
[ct=5775.488] IT'S REDEMPTION WAIT FOR THEM
[ct=5776.699] AFTER LAST WEEK'S GAME.
[ct=5778.999] NOW THEY ARE STARTING TO SHOW
[ct=5781.478] THAT HEART AND ATTITUDE YOU
[ct=5782.389] EXPECT FROM A MIKE TOMLIN
[ct=5782.904] COACHED TEAM.
[ct=5786.552] AL: AFTER AN AWFUL FIRST QUARTER
[ct=5787.009] AND A HALF.
[ct=5789.407] HERE IS ELLIOT, AND HIS BIG
[ct=5790.211] NIGHT CONTINUES.
[ct=5794.052] AS HE SKIRTS THE SIDELINE COMES
[ct=5794.052] CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5799.808] HE WILL SPIKE THE BALL JUST A
[ct=5800.387] LITTLE BIT SHORT OF IT.
[ct=5804.920] KIRK: ZAPPE STARTS 14 AND 21, WE
[ct=5805.452] WERE ALL MARVELING AROUND THE
[ct=5809.237] COUNTRY AT 196 YARDS, THREE
[ct=5812.295] GETS SACKED BY ROBERTS, AND
[ct=5812.849] SINCE THEN, JUST FOUR OF SIX FOR
[ct=5815.229] ABOUT 35 YARDS.
[ct=5817.980] AL: COME BACK TO EARTH.
[ct=5820.844] SECOND AND INCHES.
[ct=5831.354] ZEKE, AS SOON AS HE GETS TO THE
[ct=5834.377] LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, COMING INTO
[ct=5835.046] THIS SPOT RIGHT NOW IS ELANDON
[ct=5839.328] ROBERTS AND HE IS THERE BUT
[ct=5840.289] ZEKE GOT THE INCHES NECESSARY.
[ct=5844.262] KIRK: PATRIOTS TRY TO WORK A
[ct=5845.263] DOUBLE TEAM TO GET UP TO THESE
[ct=5847.827] BACKERS, BUT THEY ARE NOT
[ct=5848.863] HESITATING, SO THEY PICK UP THE
[ct=5852.373] BUT WATCH HOW FAST THESE GUYS
[ct=5852.666] ARE GETTING DOWNHILL.
[ct=5853.625] MAKES IT TOUGH FOR THE LINEMEN.
[ct=5858.054] 62 AND 71 WANT TO GET UP TO
[ct=5858.464] THOSE LINEBACKERS BUT TOUGH TO
[ct=5859.678] DO WHEN THEY ARE FLYING
[ct=5868.970] ELLIOTT TACKLED IN THE
[ct=5879.028] T.J. WATT WITH A CASTLE --
[ct=5880.358] TACKLE FOR LOSS OF ONE.
[ct=5883.706] KIRK: THE RIGHT GUARD PLAYING IN
[ct=5884.648] ISSUED IN MICHIGAN LAST
[ct=5886.372] NOW A ROOKIE PLAYING FOR THE
[ct=5889.073] HE WILL MAKE THIS BLOCK FROM THE
[ct=5889.462] RIGHT-HAND SPOT.
[ct=5891.157] HE MISSES BECAUSE OF THE
[ct=5891.357] QUICKNESS OF T.J. WATT.
[ct=5895.283] AGAIN, NOT JUST A PASS RUSHER.
[ct=5895.519] GREAT JOB AGAINST THE RUN.
[ct=5899.809] AL: ROOKIE OUT OF EASTERN
[ct=5900.008] MICHIGAN, FOURTH ROUND PICK.
[ct=5906.340] ZAPPE IS GOING TO TAKE OFF BUT
[ct=5906.340] NOT GET VERY FAR.
[ct=5909.964] THE HELMET.
[ct=5912.803] LOOKS AROUND FOR THE CALL,
[ct=5912.803] DOESN’
[ct=5913.267] DOESN'T GET IT.
[ct=5918.206] ROBERTS RIGHT THERE.
[ct=5920.174] THIRD DOWN AND 10.
[ct=5929.851] TOWELS FURLING.
[ct=5931.944] ALMOST EVERYBODY STANDING.
[ct=5936.151] THERE TEAM HAS TURNED IT AROUND
[ct=5936.615] TOTALLY.
[ct=5943.789] IT’
[ct=5946.732] IT'S GOING TO BE CAUGHT BUT IS
[ct=5947.216] SHY OF A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=5949.921] SMITH-SCHUSTER SETTING UP A
[ct=5950.431] FOURTH DOWN AND INCHES.
[ct=5953.453] PATRICK PETERSON IS THERE TO
[ct=5953.679] MAKE THE STOP.
[ct=5956.344] CLOCK RUNS DOWN UNDER NINE
[ct=5958.974] THEN IN COMES THE PUNT GROUP.
[ct=5961.987] KIRK: STEELERS DEFENSE DOES
[ct=5962.421] THEIR JOB AGAIN.
[ct=5964.665] WE TALKED ABOUT TRUBISKY.
[ct=5966.015] THE PLAYS THEY HAVE HAD TO MAKE
[ct=5966.852] THEY GIVE THEMSELVES A CHANCE TO
[ct=5968.337] GET POINTS ON THE BOARD.
[ct=5969.678] BUT THIS STARTS WITH THE
[ct=5970.829] STEELERS DEFENSE AFTER GIVING UP
[ct=5973.567] EARLY, THEY HAVE BEEN PUTTING UP
[ct=5974.388] SOME BLANKS AND GIVING THEIR
[ct=5974.814] OFFENSE A CHANCE.
[ct=5978.023] AL: BRYCE BARINGER, THIS WILL BE
[ct=5979.311] HIS SEVENTH PUNT OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=5981.024] THE LAST ONE WAS BLOCKED.
[ct=5985.991] GETS THIS ONE AWAY.
[ct=5993.162] HE SENDS IT INTO THE END ZONE
[ct=5994.958] AND BACK COME THE STEELERS
[ct=5995.989] STARTING FROM THE 20-YARD LINE
[ct=6000.794] WITH 8:30 TO GO IN T BY BMW.
[ct=6003.230] EARLY THIS GAME, T.J. WATT THAT
[ct=6003.887] FIRST PLAY TOOK A KNEE FROM ZEKE
[ct=6006.889] SAME DRIVE, GETS KICKED IN THE
[ct=6007.098] FACE.
[ct=6009.493] REALLY TOUGH WAY FOR THE BEST
[ct=6009.991] PLAYERS IN THE LEAGUE TO GET
[ct=6011.671] STARTED.
[ct=6013.265] GIVE MEWING LEND SOME CREDIT,
[ct=6015.329] THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HOLD UP
[ct=6016.883] BUT 90 IS JUST RELENTLESS GREAT
[ct=6018.079] IF YOU CAN'T GET THE PASS RUSH
[ct=6021.245] ON, MAKING AN IMPACT GETTING NEW
[ct=6021.880] ENGLAND BEHIND THIS TICKS TO FIT
[ct=6024.958] IN THIS RUN GAME AND STILL
[ct=6026.340] LEADING A BIG SPARK OF THIS
[ct=6027.476] DEFENSE TO GET THEM BACK IN THIS
[ct=6031.231] KIRK: ONE TACKLE FOR LOSS.
[ct=6034.080] NOW TRUBISKY, WHOM THEY WERE
[ct=6037.214] TRYING TO BOO OUT OF THE
[ct=6038.915] BUILDING AN HOUR AND A HALF AGO,
[ct=6042.455] TRYING TO LEAD A GAME-TYING OR
[ct=6044.328] GAME CHANGING DRIVE.
[ct=6045.607] STARTS WITH A SHORT PASS TO
[ct=6048.608] NAJEE HARRIS FOR A GAIN OF FOUR.
[ct=6051.971] KIRK: I LIKE WHAT MIKE TOMLIN
[ct=6052.940] TOLD US THIS WEEK WHEN HE WAS
[ct=6054.094] TALKING ABOUT HAVING A BACK UP
[ct=6055.419] TO TWO VETERANS.
[ct=6057.881] HE SAID ONE I WAS A COACH, WE
[ct=6060.064] HAD BIG MEN, AND WE HAD A
[ct=6062.414] VETERAN QUARTERBACK, AND ROOKIES
[ct=6062.748] THAT WERE THE BACKUPS AND IF HE
[ct=6065.464] WENT DOWN IT WAS A CONCERN.
[ct=6068.779] NOW YOU HAVE FLIPPED THE SCRIPT.
[ct=6069.797] YOU HAVE KENNY PICKETT, YOUNG
[ct=6070.443] CORNERBACK.
[ct=6072.560] IT HAS TAKEN SOME OF THAT
[ct=6073.985] VETERAN LEADERSHIP TO GET
[ct=6075.906] THROUGH THE ADVERSITY TONIGHT
[ct=6076.192] FOR TRUBISKY.
[ct=6078.550] AL: LOW SNAP.
[ct=6079.880] THAT'S BEEN AN ISSUE WITH THIS
[ct=6080.334] TEAM RECENTLY.
[ct=6083.157] LOOKED OUT INTO ALL KINDS OF
[ct=6084.666] TRAFFIC AND SOMEHOW, SOMEWAY
[ct=6086.378] THAT WASN'T PICKED.
[ct=6088.944] KIRK: VOIDED JENNINGS MAKE A
[ct=6089.376] GREAT PLAY ON THIS FOOTBALL.
[ct=6092.904] YOU ARE RIGHT, YOU TALK ABOUT
[ct=6093.537] THAT VETERAN EXPERIENCED.
[ct=6097.148] BUT HERE, HE CLEARLY DOES NOT
[ct=6098.226] SEE 33.
[ct=6099.723] INSTEAD OF RUSHING, THE
[ct=6101.648] QUARTERBACK SETS HIS SCREEN,
[ct=6103.197] GETS HIS HANDS ON THE RUNNING
[ct=6104.956] BACK AND ALMOST GETS HIS HAND ON
[ct=6105.388] THAT FOOTBALL TO TIP IT THE AIR.
[ct=6109.533] JUST GOOD INSTINCTS ON THAT
[ct=6110.697] SECOND DOWN PLAY ON THE SPRING,
[ct=6112.062] WHICH THEY HIT A FEW OF THOSE IN
[ct=6113.128] THE SECOND HALF.
[ct=6116.871] AL: NOW THIRD DOWN AND FIVE.
[ct=6124.592] SENDING AN EXTRA MAN.
[ct=6128.703] PASS IS HAULED IN AT THE 29-YARD
[ct=6129.399] LINE BY FREIERMUTH.
[ct=6132.948] AND YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE
[ct=6133.351] OFFICIAL IS.
[ct=6134.863] THEY WILL SPOT IT SHORT.
[ct=6140.942] YOU GOT FOURTH DOWN AND INCHES,
[ct=6146.054] 7:20, PUNCH GROUP COMES OUT.
[ct=6146.249] CROWD DOESN’
[ct=6146.572] CROWD DOESN'T LIKE IT.
[ct=6150.539] CROWD LIKES IT.
[ct=6155.956] KIRK: GOT A WHISTLE BY THE
[ct=6157.329] STEELERS SIDE.
[ct=6158.880] THEY WILL CALL A TIMEOUT.
[ct=6160.662] AL: OH MAN.
[ct=6162.968] THAT LEAVES THEM IN A
[ct=6163.175] THREE-POINT GAME WITH ONE
[ct=6167.366] AND A LITTLE OVER SEVEN TO PLAY.
[ct=6170.340] KIRK: I DON'T THINK YOU CALL A
[ct=6170.910] TIMEOUT TO PUNT HERE.
[ct=6173.963] THEY WILL GET THIS OFFENS
[ct=6174.330] TOGETHER.
[ct=6177.816] AL: NEXT WEEK WE'RE IN VEGAS.
[ct=6179.326] YOU HAVE GOT THE CHARGERS AND
[ct=6184.938] THE RAIDERS PLAYED SOME
[ct=6185.384] CLASSICS THROUGH THE YEARS.
[ct=6188.187] SAN DIEGO AND OAKLAND, NOW LAS
[ct=6188.187] VEGAS.
[ct=6191.784] 5-7, BIG GAME AS HE TRIES TO
[ct=6192.222] STAY IN THE PLAYOFF ON.
[ct=6197.186] THEY DID CALL A TIMEOUT.
[ct=6197.643] THEY WILL GO FOR IT AFTER ALL OF
[ct=6200.487] WITH THE BALL JUST SHY OF THE
[ct=6200.663] 30-YARD LINE.
[ct=6203.359] GAIN OF HALF A YARD.
[ct=6208.368] HARRIS IS THE RUNNING BACK.
[ct=6208.755] TIGHT FORMATION.
[ct=6215.465] TRUBISKY KEEPS IT, RUNS OVER THE
[ct=6215.860] LEFT GUARD.
[ct=6217.916] PICKS UP A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=6220.885] NOW THEY LOVE HIM.
[ct=6227.675] KIRK: THEY GOT A GOOD PUSH ON
[ct=6228.049] THAT LEFT SIDE.
[ct=6231.075] WATCH THIS LEFT GUARD, LEFT
[ct=6232.933] GOOD JOB BY TRUBISKY.
[ct=6234.312] HE WAS INITIALLY GOING TO GET
[ct=6236.584] RIGHT BEHIND MASON COLE, BUT
[ct=6237.942] ENDS UP SEEING THAT SURGE AND
[ct=6240.373] JUST STEPS IN BEHIND THAT LEFT
[ct=6241.959] SIDE OF THE OFFENSIVE LINE.
[ct=6244.785] AL: SAM WAS RIGHT THERE TO LEAD
[ct=6245.205] THE WAY.
[ct=6247.961] 6:30 LEFT IN THE FOURTH.
[ct=6250.962] TRUBISKY TO THE OUTSIDE.
[ct=6252.925] MAKES THE GRAB.
[ct=6255.707] PICKS UP ABOUT EIGHT.
[ct=6258.080] JONATHAN JONES ON THE TACKLE,
[ct=6261.754] KIRK: JONES WALKED UP AND AT THE
[ct=6264.566] SNAP OF THE FOOTBALL DROPPED.
[ct=6266.185] TRUBISKY ABLE TO LOOK OUT THERE,
[ct=6266.698] HE'S BEEN DYING TO GET THE
[ct=6267.914] FOOTBALL TO PICKENS ALL NIGHT.
[ct=6273.894] HE HAS -- IS HIS GO TO GUY.
[ct=6275.007] HAS HAD A RELATIVELY QUIET
[ct=6275.007] NIGHT.
[ct=6276.500] JUST FOUR CATCHES AND 18 YARDS.
[ct=6279.956] AL: LONGEST RECEPTION IS JUST
[ct=6279.956] SEVEN YARDS.
[ct=6283.359] LONGEST CATCH OF THE NIGHT BY
[ct=6287.046] THE ONLY ONE HE HAS GOT TONIGHT.
[ct=6287.229] THAT WAS FOR THE TOUCHDOWN.
[ct=6291.691] SECOND AND THREE.
[ct=6291.691] PICKENS AGAIN.
[ct=6297.179] AND HE IS STOPPED IN HIS TRACKS.
[ct=6298.493] JONATHAN JONES MAKING THAT
[ct=6299.370] THAT'S GOING TO SET UP A THIRD
[ct=6301.723] AND THREE.
[ct=6303.527] CLOCK RUN DOWN TO 5:40.
[ct=6312.728] GOT TO THINK THEY DID IT ONCE,
[ct=6313.951] IF THEY DON'T GET IT HERE, THEY
[ct=6315.366] WILL GO FOR IT ON FOURTH DOWN.
[ct=6318.673] KIRK: AS THAT CLOCK KEEPS
[ct=6319.892] TICKING, THE OPPORTUNITIES WILL
[ct=6320.618] GET FEWER AND FEWER.
[ct=6322.523] NOW THAT THEY ARE DOWN TO ONE
[ct=6323.314] TIMEOUT AND THE TWO-MINUTE
[ct=6327.474] AL: THAT'LL BE A SACK.
[ct=6330.486] THAT WILL BE THE WORST SCENARIO.
[ct=6331.950] THIRD AND THREE.
[ct=6333.265] TRUBISKY UNDER PRESSURE,
[ct=6336.398] ESCAPING AND JUST HAS TO FLING
[ct=6336.874] THAT ONE AWAY.
[ct=6340.498] FREIERMUTH WAS THERE, HE WAS
[ct=6341.402] WELL COVERED.
[ct=6342.866] NOW YOU GO TO FOURTH AND THREE.
[ct=6346.713] NOW THE PUNT GROUP COMES OUT AND
[ct=6347.451] THEY WILL TAKE THE FIELD HERE.
[ct=6351.111] KIRK: GIVE CREDIT TO SEE BELLA
[ct=6352.008] CHECK AND THAT DEFENSE ON THIRD
[ct=6354.336] GOOD JOB OF TAKING AWAY ALL HIS
[ct=6354.687] OPTIONS.
[ct=6357.565] TRUBISKY ENDS UP THROWING THIS
[ct=6357.992] FOOTBALL AWAY.
[ct=6366.472] AL: PRESSLEY HARVIN IS SENDING
[ct=6367.172] THAT ONE.
[ct=6370.898] GOT A COUPLE OF FLAGS.
[ct=6376.218] IT WAS FOURTH AND THREE, THAT'S
[ct=6378.060] GOING TO BE A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=6378.312] IT WAS AGAINST NEW ENGLAND.
[ct=6382.238] KIRK: I THINK IT IS TAVAI,
[ct=6384.627] NUMBER 48.
[ct=6387.275] REFEREE: FALSE START.
[ct=6391.444] WALKER, NUMBER 46.
[ct=6395.053] KIRK: IT’
[ct=6399.740] KIRK: IT'S 48, TAVAI,
[ct=6400.716] LINEBACKER.
[ct=6401.604] HOW FIRED UP HIS PITTSBURGH?
[ct=6412.218] AL: THEY ARE GOING TO GET
[ct=6413.557] THEY ARE CALLING THIS ON THE
[ct=6413.557] CENTER.
[ct=6416.879] AL: HE SAID A FALSE START ON
[ct=6418.456] CHRISTIAN KOONTZ.
[ct=6423.861] AND IF THAT IS AGAINST
[ct=6426.537] PITTSBURGH, CALLING IT A FALSE
[ct=6428.050] START, THAT IS THE FIRST PENALTY
[ct=6429.692] OF THE NIGHT AGAINST THE
[ct=6430.245] STEELERS.
[ct=6436.023] AT THE MOST INOPPORTUNE TIME.
[ct=6436.817] TERRY, WHAT DID YOU SEE?
[ct=6441.211] KIRK: IT LOOKS LIKE THEY CALLED
[ct=6441.750] HIS HEAD SNAPPING UP.
[ct=6443.061] HE CAN DO THAT AS LONG AS IT IS
[ct=6444.106] SLOW ON DELIVERY.
[ct=6446.654] AL: THEY WILL CHECK THAT OUT
[ct=6447.297] AFTER THE POND.
[ct=6450.934] WE WILL GO TO BREAK THEN BRING
[ct=6451.430] TERRY BACK IN.
[ct=6452.794] IT IS FAIR CAUGHT AT THE 14-YARD
[ct=6457.367] GO TO A COMMERCIAL THEN WE WILL
[ct=6464.483] AL: THEY CALLED OUT CHRISTIAN
[ct=6464.947] KUNTZ IN THE MIDDLE.
[ct=6467.174] TERRY, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING?
[ct=6471.800] TERRY: HE MADE AN ABRUPT
[ct=6472.212] MOVEMENT PRIOR TO THE SNAP.
[ct=6473.880] OBVIOUSLY IT IS SUBJECTIVE.
[ct=6478.359] IT SEEMS LIKE AT THE MOMENT, WE
[ct=6478.543] SEE IT FROM A LONG STAFFORD.
[ct=6484.135] KIRK: YOU SEE THIS ALMOST EVERY
[ct=6485.636] TIME.
[ct=6489.922] AL: THE FOOT WAS ON HIM, BUT HE
[ct=6489.922] ESCAPES.
[ct=6492.654] MEANWHILE, THE WINDOW DOWN ON A
[ct=6493.735] SITUATION WHERE HE CAN TAKE THE
[ct=6497.480] ONLY THE FOURTH TIME HALFWAY
[ct=6497.868] THROUGH.
[ct=6501.143] AL: IT LOOKS LIKE THE STEELERS
[ct=6503.501] CAUGHT A BREAK WITH TWO BY
[ct=6510.519] JUMPING OFF AND -- TAVAI JUMPING
[ct=6510.759] RIGHT.
[ct=6512.173] THAT CLOCK IS TICKING.
[ct=6513.584] THEY USED TWO TIMEOUTS.
[ct=6519.962] AL: MAKE SURE ALL OF THEIR
[ct=6524.754] POINTS WERE IN THE FIRST HALF.
[ct=6524.927] USING THAT PLAYTIME.
[ct=6527.846] SEVEN AND 6.
[ct=6533.577] THEY WORK TOWARDS ELLIOTT, COMES
[ct=6535.584] OVER THREE YARDS SHY OF THE
[ct=6537.462] ZEKE TONIGHT HAS.
[ct=6539.381] THE BALL 19 TIMES, 53 YARDS.
[ct=6542.303] THAT IS NOT PARTICULARLY
[ct=6542.303] IMPRESSIVE.
[ct=6544.938] THOSE NUMBERS WITH SEVEN CATCHES
[ct=6546.114] AND 72.
[ct=6549.256] KIRK: THE BIGGEST THING HE WAS
[ct=6550.457] LOOKING FORWARD TO TONIGHT WAS
[ct=6550.894] TO GET THOSE TOUCHES.
[ct=6554.774] THE MORE HE GETS, THE BETTER HE
[ct=6556.617] GETS, BUT IT IS TOUGH TO RUN THE
[ct=6557.757] BALL AGAINST THE STEELERS FRONT.
[ct=6563.983] AL: 56 GAMES, LEADING 10 OF THEM
[ct=6563.983] MORE.
[ct=6568.718] DOWN 18 POINTS AT ONE POINT.
[ct=6570.884] THIRD DOWN AND 2.
[ct=6575.198] THERE IS ELLIOTT AGAIN, AND THIS
[ct=6576.006] TIME HE WILL NOT GET THEM.
[ct=6578.990] THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE
[ct=6578.990] STEELERS NEEDED HERE.
[ct=6581.651] THREE AND OUT.
[ct=6583.217] AT THE SAME TIME, THEY GET THE
[ct=6583.217] BALL BACK.
[ct=6585.909] HAYWARD WITH THE OTHER TACKLE.
[ct=6589.502] KIRK: YOU TALK ABOUT T.J. WATT
[ct=6593.112] AND CAM HAYWARD DID A GREAT JOB
[ct=6596.995] USING THAT LEVERAGE, GETTING OFF
[ct=6597.720] BY ANDREWS.
[ct=6599.235] THESE VETERANS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
[ct=6600.942] IS AT STAKE AND HOW IMPORTANT
[ct=6602.491] THE THREE AND OUT WAS TO
[ct=6603.265] PRESERVE THE CLOCK.
[ct=6604.672] THEY DID THEIR JOB AGAIN TO GET
[ct=6605.269] THE BALL BACK.
[ct=6609.841] AL: IS IT HOT OF THE NIGHT.
[ct=6621.365] -- HIS EIGTH PUT OF THE
[ct=6625.682] THE POSTSEASON PICTURE RIGHT NOW
[ct=6630.530] IN MIAMI AND MIAMI IS IN THE TOP
[ct=6630.988] OF THEIR DIVISION.
[ct=6633.945] JACKSON REACHING FOURTH.
[ct=6639.080] AT THE MOMENT, CLEVELAND IS 7-5.
[ct=6641.111] SO IS INDIANAPOLIS.
[ct=6645.232] YOU GET THE BENGALS.
[ct=6649.089] LAS VEGAS AND LOS ANGELES, WE
[ct=6650.106] WILL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.
[ct=6654.104] KIRK: ALL FOUR TEAMS IN THE
[ct=6656.487] CINCINNATI FOUR WITH THE
[ct=6656.768] STEELERS AND THE BROWNS.
[ct=6661.258] AL: DOWN TO THE WIRE, ONLY ONE
[ct=6664.037] TEAM GETS THE BYE.
[ct=6666.774] THE OTHER SIX GET TO THE
[ct=6666.971] WILD-CARD ROUND.
[ct=6671.122] TRUBISKY FIRES A LITTLE HIGH.
[ct=6674.875] IN THE MIDDLE AND INCOMPLETE,
[ct=6681.566] KIRK: USUALLY FREIERMUTH WITH
[ct=6682.723] HIS RADIUS CAN MAKE THAT CATCH
[ct=6685.871] IS AMAZING WHAT THIS STEELERS
[ct=6687.871] TEAM HAS HAD TO DO TO GET THEM
[ct=6690.039] BACK INTO THIS GAME AND AT THIS
[ct=6690.855] POINT, YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
[ct=6692.958] FREIERMUTH, LOOKING FOR NAJEE
[ct=6697.351] CAN YOU ISOLATE AND DYONTAE
[ct=6698.384] JOHNSON HAS HAD A QUIET NIGHT.
[ct=6701.664] NOT MANY OPPORTUNITIES OVER 18.
[ct=6705.817] AL: JUST THREE CHARGES, ONE
[ct=6706.687] CATCH, BUT IT WAS FOR THE
[ct=6710.337] GETS IT UP UNDERNEATH.
[ct=6711.837] THAT WAS THE RESULT OF THE FIRST
[ct=6715.544] TAKING IT TO THE 40 YARD LINE IS
[ct=6715.544] NAJEE HARRIS.
[ct=6720.214] KIRK: GOOD JOB SHOWING PACE
[ct=6721.444] SINCE BY TRUBISKY.
[ct=6725.245] INSTEAD OF FORCING, HE
[ct=6726.402] EVENTUALLY FINDS THE CHECK DOWN.
[ct=6727.795] LET HIM PICK UP THE FIRST HAND.
[ct=6730.660] AL: BETTER HURRY UP.
[ct=6733.409] TO THE OUTSIDE, TOO HIGH.
[ct=6734.832] NO GOOD.
[ct=6738.365] HE HAS BEEN TARGETED FOR THE
[ct=6739.537] NINE TO GO.
[ct=6743.296] KIRK: ONE THING TO TURN THE
[ct=6745.113] PATRIOTS THIS YEAR AS THEY DO
[ct=6746.647] NOT HAVE THAT DIFFERENCE MAKER
[ct=6748.720] LIKE A MATTHEW DO DONE WHO BEGAN
[ct=6750.281] THE HOLD WITHOUT THE BLITZ.
[ct=6752.803] TYPICALLY THEY HAVE GOT TO DIAL
[ct=6755.940] UP THE BLITZ HAVE SOME PRESSURE.
[ct=6757.361] IT HAS BEEN THE ACHILLES HEEL
[ct=6760.348] FOR THIS DEFENSE ALL YEAR LONG,
[ct=6760.348] ESPECIALLY IN THIS SITUATION.
[ct=6763.194] CAN THEY AFFORD TRUBISKY AND UP?
[ct=6768.849] AL: THEY HAVE HAD TWO SACKS
[ct=6770.412] SECOND AND 10.
[ct=6771.390] THE OUTSIDE QUICKLY.
[ct=6773.540] GETTING OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=6779.457] JOHNSON FORCED BY J.C. JACKSON.
[ct=6782.807] KIRK: JUST TWO PLACE FROM
[ct=6787.474] TRUBISKY THAT COULD LET THEM
[ct=6788.879] CHECK DOWN TO NAJEE HARRIS.
[ct=6790.142] THIS TIME SEES SOFT COVERAGE OUT
[ct=6792.061] THERE BY THE CORNER AND FLIPS IT
[ct=6792.562] OUT THERE.
[ct=6795.778] TAKE THE POSITIVE YARDS, SET UP
[ct=6797.092] A THIRD DOWN AND SHORT NEAR THE
[ct=6797.754] MIDFIELD.
[ct=6802.015] AL: SULLIVAN CALLING IN THE
[ct=6805.261] 30 AND 2.
[ct=6808.713] HARRIS GETS WIDE TO THE LEFT.
[ct=6811.314] THE LEFTY HERE.
[ct=6815.931] TRUBISKY FIRES A LITTLE HIGH,
[ct=6819.636] COULDN'T GET TO PICKENS.
[ct=6824.458] YOU STILL HAVE ONE SECOND BEFORE
[ct=6825.833] THE TWO MINUTE WARNING, SO THERE
[ct=6826.899] IS THE GO FOR IT ON THE FOURTH
[ct=6832.798] AND IN EFFECT, THEY STILL HAVE
[ct=6832.798] THAT EXTRA TIME OUT OF THE TWO
[ct=6834.939] MINUTE WARNING PLUS THE ONE THEY
[ct=6835.884] HAD, BUT THEY HAD TO CONVERT.
[ct=6838.456] KIRK: THIS IS IT.
[ct=6843.242] FOURTH DOWN AND 2.
[ct=6843.242] SEES IT ON THE LINE,
[ct=6845.492] OPPORTUNITIES ON THE LINE TO BE
[ct=6847.286] ABLE TO KEEP THIS DRIVE ALIVE
[ct=6847.780] AND THEIR ENERGY AND HOPES.
[ct=6851.381] AL: JAYLEN WARREN IS IN THE
[ct=6861.164] NEED TWO, GOING DEEP, GOING FOR
[ct=6861.586] THE BALL.
[ct=6866.072] INTENDED FOR JOHNSON.
[ct=6870.227] SO THEY NEEDED TWO YARDS AND
[ct=6870.728] WENT FOR THE HOME RUN.
[ct=6874.629] JONATHAN JONES COVERING.
[ct=6879.722] ONE PAUSE IS OFFICIALLY ON THE
[ct=6888.639] AND THE PATRIOTS STILL UP 1:55 A
[ct=6890.536] CONCEIVABLY, THE STEELERS COULD
[ct=6890.979] GET THE BALL BACK.
[ct=6894.288] WITH NEXT TO NO TIME REMAINING.
[ct=6896.446] FIRST THINGS FIRST.
[ct=6899.298] KIRK: I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT
[ct=6899.776] CALL.
[ct=6901.734] AL: NEITHER DID I.
[ct=6903.365] FOURTH AND 2.
[ct=6905.337] WHO CAME FIRST?
[ct=6909.342] >> FALSE START.
[ct=6912.254] OFFENSE UNDER 85.
[ct=6916.472] KIRK: IT IS EASY TO SIT UP HERE
[ct=6917.984] AND GUESS CALLS, BUT IT IS A LOW
[ct=6918.731] PERCENTAGE THROW.
[ct=6920.911] YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF GO BALLS TO
[ct=6921.398] SIT OUTSIDE.
[ct=6924.076] YOU JUST THROW IT AND HOPE.
[ct=6926.992] IT IS FOURTH AND 2.
[ct=6927.373] YOU HAVE NOT THROWN AT DIONTAE
[ct=6930.518] JOHNSON ALL NIGHT.
[ct=6931.177] IT IS A LOW PERCENTAGE THROW.
[ct=6935.495] ROLL IT OUT EITHER ABOVE OR A
[ct=6935.495] PINCH.
[ct=6936.833] GIVE YOURSELF THE OPTION.
[ct=6940.932] JUST THROUGH IT UP THERE.
[ct=6944.316] AL: TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU.
[ct=6946.324] THE FINAL TIMEOUT.
[ct=6951.512] KIRK: THIS IS A TOUGH COUPLE OF
[ct=6951.808] WEEKS FOR PITTSBURGH.
[ct=6953.302] YOU LOOK AT THAT CARDINALS GAME
[ct=6956.272] MAYBE IT WAS AN ABERRATION.
[ct=6959.374] A 2-10 TEAM.
[ct=6964.657] COMING UP SHORT AGAIN THIS
[ct=6970.815] AL: THE STAR OF THE GAME ON THIS
[ct=6972.479] THE STEELERS GOT BACK INTO THE
[ct=6975.568] GAME AND IT MIGHT BE TOO LITTLE,
[ct=6975.568] TOO LATE.
[ct=6977.072] IT IS ALL COMING ON THE POST
[ct=6977.347] GAME SHOW.
[ct=6979.745] KIRK: ON THE OTHER
[ct=6982.355] ENGLAND AND BILL BELICHICK LEFT
[ct=6984.073] DEAD FOR 2-10.
[ct=6987.363] BUT THE FACT THEY CAME OUT AND
[ct=6987.833] COMPETED WITH BIG INJURIES.
[ct=6991.350] HAPPY TO PLAY WELL AND GREW UP A
[ct=6991.350] BIT.
[ct=6994.490] SOME POSITIVES AT LEAST FOR NEW
[ct=6994.981] ENGLAND TONIGHT.
[ct=6998.536] AL: ELLIOTT.
[ct=7001.669] THAT SHOULD TAKE US ABOUT TO THE
[ct=7005.346] FINISH LINE FOR THE FIRST DOWN
[ct=7007.032] AS THE CLOCK KEEPS ON RUNNING,
[ct=7007.329] AND IT WILL.
[ct=7011.807] YOU LOOK AT NEW ENGLAND'S SEASON
[ct=7015.252] AND ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT
[ct=7016.830] THEY GOT FLEXED OUT OF THE GAME
[ct=7018.051] ON MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL WITH
[ct=7018.545] PATRICK MAHOMES COMING TO TOWN.
[ct=7020.342] KIRK: [LAUGHTER]
[ct=7022.852] THAT SUMS IT UP.
[ct=7024.809] AL: IT REALLY DOES.
[ct=7027.450] BILL BELICHICK --
[ct=7030.721] >> THE PLAYER IS UNDER REVIEW.
[ct=7034.746] AL: AT THE MOMENT, THEY CALL IT
[ct=7035.025] A FIRST DOWN.
[ct=7037.450] ALL OF THE REVIEW IS FROM
[ct=7037.786] UPSTAIRS.
[ct=7040.894] BELICHICK IS LIKE, YOU HAVE TO
[ct=7042.015] BE KIDDING ME.
[ct=7043.983] IF IT IS NOT A FIRST DOWN, IT
[ct=7045.957] WOULD BE THIRD DOWN AND INCHES.
[ct=7049.327] AND THEY WOULD NOT START THE
[ct=7056.212] KIRK: THE ELLIOTT -- EZEKIEL
[ct=7059.114] ELLIOTT TALKS ABOUT THE GAME
[ct=7060.611] GOING ON, AND THAT IS WHAT HE
[ct=7061.368] DID IN THE EARLY DAYS WITH THE
[ct=7061.743] COWBOYS.
[ct=7063.949] AL: LOOKS LIKE HE IS DOWN ON
[ct=7064.180] THAT SHOT.
[ct=7078.243] KIRK: HERE ARE THE NEXT GEN
[ct=7078.243] STATS, POWERED BY AWS.
[ct=7084.158] PATRIOTS TONIGHT, ENTERING
[ct=7084.705] TONIGHT 35%.
[ct=7087.328] I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT IS NOT
[ct=7087.328] QUITE AT 100%.
[ct=7089.689] THE CURRENT IS 99.2%.
[ct=7097.514] AL: NO MIRACLE AT THE
[ct=7097.902] MEADOWLANDS HERE.
[ct=7101.939] KIRK: BELICHICK WILL BE OUR
[ct=7105.532] CELEBRITY PICKER AND I AM SO
[ct=7106.093] EXCITED THAT HE HOPEFULLY WILL
[ct=7106.560] BE IN A GOOD MOOD.
[ct=7109.008] THE 50 ARMY GAME AT FOX GROVE.
[ct=7113.797] AL: I KNOW IF IT IS 99.9%, HE
[ct=7114.154] WILL PICK NAVY.
[ct=7116.849] GUARANTEED.
[ct=7119.617] THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE FAMILY.
[ct=7121.355] STEVE AND THE NAVAL ACADEMY.
[ct=7132.152] >> AFTER HERE, THE RUNNER WAS
[ct=7133.672] SHORT THE LINE ON THE GAME WHEN
[ct=7134.398] HE WAS DOWN BY CONTACT.
[ct=7138.710] THE TALE OF THE 39 YARD LINE.
[ct=7140.949] PLEASE SETS THE GAME CLOCK AT
[ct=7142.956] 1:46.
[ct=7146.921] THE PLAY CLOCK SHOULD BE SET TO
[ct=7147.901] 30 SECONDS IN THE SITUATION.
[ct=7151.177] AL: THE PLAY CLOCK GOES TO 30.
[ct=7158.583] BEFORE THEY SNAP IT, YOU COULD
[ct=7158.827] TAKE IT DOWN TO 1:12 OR SO.
[ct=7162.151] THERE YOU GO.
[ct=7165.317] 1:36.
[ct=7168.505] 30 SECONDS TO GET THE PLAYOFF.
[ct=7170.560] DOWN 30 INCHES.
[ct=7174.431] THERE FOURTH DOWN WITH A MINUTE.
[ct=7177.715] AND THEN THEY CAN DO WHATEVER
[ct=7178.045] THEY WANT WITH IT.
[ct=7182.850] THAT IS WHY YOU HAVE --
[ct=7185.628] KIRK: THAT IS MY POINT, HE IS
[ct=7187.766] HANGING IN THERE.
[ct=7192.555] ONE THING THAT BAILEY IS HAPPY
[ct=7193.933] ABOUT TONIGHT, HE AND BRIAN WERE
[ct=7194.172] INSANE TONIGHT.
[ct=7197.271] THE BALL WAS COMING OUT AND HE
[ct=7199.017] HAS THROWN TO ZEKE ELLIOTT OUT
[ct=7199.736] OF THE BACKFIELD.
[ct=7200.803] THAT IS THEIR STRENGTH.
[ct=7205.006] THE RECEIVERS ARE STILL NOT THE
[ct=7207.942] THREATS THAT THEY NEED DOWNFIELD
[ct=7208.460] , BUT THEY FOUND SOME MATCHUPS
[ct=7208.871] THAT THEY LIKED.
[ct=7211.104] THEY WERE HITTING THEM EARLY.
[ct=7214.540] AL: SO THEY CAN RUN THE CLOCK
[ct=7216.122] DOWN HERE.
[ct=7222.295] >> TIMEOUT, NEW ENGLAND.
[ct=7223.282] THERE FIRST.
[ct=7224.618] 30 SECONDS.
[ct=7228.700] AL: AND A REMINDER, TO VEGAS WE
[ct=7228.700] GO NEXT WEEK.
[ct=7232.074] CHARGERS AND RAIDERS ON THURSDAY
[ct=7232.265] NIGHT FOOTBALL.
[ct=7239.365] WE WILL SEE WHAT ANTONIO PIERCE
[ct=7240.016] AND COMPANY HAVE IN STORE.
[ct=7241.417] CHARGERS NEEDED THAT WIN
[ct=7244.008] ENGLAND DESPERATELY BECAUSE THEY
[ct=7245.702] HAVE GOT 6-0.
[ct=7250.063] KIRK: THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS, LAS
[ct=7251.754] VEGAS A QUICK FLIGHT.
[ct=7252.569] LOS ANGELES, JUST HAVE TO WALK.
[ct=7256.120] AL: HOW MANY COAST-TO-COAST DO
[ct=7256.576] YOU THINK ONE CAN MAKE?
[ct=7258.137] YOU HAVE EARNED IT.
[ct=7265.415] SETTING UP FOR THE PUSH.
[ct=7268.098] THERE YOU HAVE IT.
[ct=7272.052] KIRK: HOW COME NOBODY CAN RUN
[ct=7273.399] THAT EXCEPT FOR KELSEY AND JALEN
[ct=7273.399] HURTS?
[ct=7276.036] THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES.
[ct=7278.675] AL: SO I THINK HE DOES NOT G
[ct=7281.387] KIRK: I THINK HE LOST YARDS.
[ct=7284.037] BROWN.
[ct=7286.811] KIRK: I WOULD STICK WITH KELSEY.
[ct=7288.081] ZERO PUSH.
[ct=7289.406] AL: NOTHING.
[ct=7293.409] KIRK: THE EAGLES GET THREE YARDS
[ct=7294.674] IN THAT PLAY, EVERY TIME.
[ct=7298.648] AL: IT IS STILL FOURTH DOWN, AND
[ct=7301.365] HERE COMES, WITH THE CLOCK
[ct=7302.674] RUNNING DOWN, THEY CAN RUN THE
[ct=7307.992] CLOCK DOWN NOW TO ABOUT 20, 21.
[ct=7310.684] YOU HAVE GOT -- THIS IS WHY YOU
[ct=7312.012] HAVE IT.
[ct=7314.600] KIRK: IT WENT THE .9.
[ct=7321.324] >> NEW ENGLAND, 30 SECONDS.
[ct=7323.956] AL: THE MOST AMAZING THING
[ct=7326.574] TONIGHT, 31 POINTS IN THE FIRST
[ct=7326.574] HALF, AND YOU KNOW WHAT I AM
[ct=7327.901] TALKING ABOUT.
[ct=7330.577] KIRK: EVERYBODY COULD TAKE A
[ct=7330.577] DEEP BREATH.
[ct=7333.224] AL: THEY COULD.
[ct=7333.224] [LAUGHTER]
[ct=7338.557] KIRK: WE WAITED 30 MINUTES.
[ct=7338.557] IT IS OVER, DONE DEAL.
[ct=7345.222] I THINK IT WAS THE LOWEST OVER
[ct=7347.901] UNDER TOTAL YOU HAVE HAD IN 18
[ct=7349.238] OR 19 YEARS IN THE NFL.
[ct=7350.560] NOT THAT ANYBODY PAYS ATTENTION
[ct=7351.875] TO IT.
[ct=7359.959] JUST INSANE IN TODAY'S WORLD.
[ct=7364.021] OK.
[ct=7368.032] NOSEDOWN, BALL IN THE AIR.
[ct=7370.623] SCHEDULED OUT OF BOUNDS.
[ct=7374.626] A FEW SECONDS OFF THAT CLOCK.
[ct=7375.965] YOU HAVE GOT 15 SECONDS.
[ct=7378.598] SO WHAT DO YOU DO HERE?
[ct=7381.332] HAVE GOT THE 15 WAY LATERAL.
[ct=7384.714] TOO FAR FOR A HAIL MARY.
[ct=7389.538] KIRK: WITH 15 SECONDS, YOU PUT
[ct=7391.042] ONE UP TO PICKENS AND YOU HOPE
[ct=7394.142] MAYBE FOR EITHER A MIX OF
[ct=7395.260] PLAYERS THAT YOU GET A PASS OR
[ct=7395.260] INTERFERENCE.
[ct=7399.474] IF HE MAKES A PLAY, TRY TO GET
[ct=7400.096] HIM OUT OF BOUNDS, OBVIOUSLY.
[ct=7403.785] I WOULD JUST TRY TO LOOK FOR
[ct=7405.305] THROWING IT AS FAR AS YOU CAN,
[ct=7407.202] TRYING TO THROW IT AND GET A
[ct=7407.497] PASS INTERFERENCE.
[ct=7410.404] TWO RECEIVERS OFF TO THE LEFT.
[ct=7413.480] AL: TWO LEFT, TWO RIGHT.
[ct=7418.179] THEY GO TO BUY TO -- TWO BY TWO.
[ct=7421.850] TRUBISKY FIRES OVER THE MIDDLE.
[ct=7423.531] JOHNSON WILL GET THE PASS.
[ct=7427.553] DIONTAE JOHNSON WAS SEVEN
[ct=7427.553] SECONDS.
[ct=7432.078] IS ABLE TO MOVE THE BALL OUT TO
[ct=7433.368] THE 36 YARD LINE.
[ct=7437.969] KNOWS?
[ct=7442.187] KIRK: HE FELL ON HIS ROUTE, GOT
[ct=7445.950] BACK UP, CUT THE FOOTBALL --
[ct=7449.605] CAUGHT THE FOOTBALL, AND SOMEHOW
[ct=7451.832] GOT ON THE SIDELINES TO GET THAT
[ct=7458.954] AL: AGAIN TWO BY TWO.
[ct=7463.271] TRUBISKY WILL FIRE OVER THE
[ct=7463.271] MIDDLE AND THAT WILL BE PUT.
[ct=7466.085] NOW YOU HAVE A LATERAL THAT WILL
[ct=7468.216] BE SKIMMING AROUND AND WINDS UP
[ct=7471.066] IN THE HANDS OF NEW ENGLAND'S
[ct=7474.089] THEY ARE LOOKING FOR THE HOOK
[ct=7476.146] AND LADDER, HOOK AND TRAILER,
[ct=7477.793] WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT
[ct=7478.035] COMING AWAY WITH A LOSS.
[ct=7483.146] THE PITTSBURGH STEELER'S AS THEY
[ct=7485.422] LOOK TO SCHEDULE, THEY ARE 7-4.
[ct=7490.354] YOU HAVE TWO TWO WIN TEAMS
[ct=7491.405] COMING ON SUNDAY AND THURSDAY,
[ct=7491.891] AND THEY LOSE BOTH.
[ct=7494.711] KIRK: ONE OF THE BIGGER
[ct=7496.258] SURPRISES, ESPECIALLY THE FACT
[ct=7497.560] THEY ARE HERE IN PITTSBURGH.
[ct=7500.223] LOSING 22 TEAMS.
[ct=7502.902] YOU LOSE TO THE CARDINALS AND
[ct=7504.211] SAY, WE NEED TO GET THI
[ct=7506.920] WE ARE PLAYING THE PATRIOTS AND
[ct=7508.189] BILL BELICHICK.
[ct=7509.550] WE KNOW THAT THEY WILL
[ct=7510.900] AND THIS IS A CHANCE FOR
[ct=7510.900] REDEMPTION.
[ct=7513.510] THEY STARTED SO SLOW.
[ct=7514.889] THEY DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO
[ct=7516.180] COME BACK AND WIN THIS GAME.
[ct=7517.520] AL: THEY WERE
