================================================================================

Sports coverage of the National Football League is on the air. Coming up, we've got what should prove to be a good one as it'll be the Tampa Bay Buccaneers taking on the Houston Texans. [Applause] And we are underway from NRG Stadium in Houston. and out a little across the 25 to the 27. >> So out come the Bucks now for their first drive >> under center. It's the 2017 Heisman Trophy winner as you get a look at Baker Mayfield. >> And what a career resurgence for Baker Mayfield. He went from being a discarded starter to a Pro Bowl quarterback. and he's coming off a year where he set career highs in passing yards, touchdowns, and completion percentage. But best of all, the ultimate leader for his ball club. >> Buccaneer. >> That's a good start to the ball game. Maybe a little bit of a tone setter offensively. They come out throwing right away and it's an early completion and a quick first down. >> On first and 10, here's Irving. They'll be taken down at the 48 for a pick up of two yards. >> Oh, that's a real nice job there by the defensive front. They just engaged and held their ground. But how about the guy who made the play? We often talk about whether they take a good first step or not. >> Many times you just don't take any step. Just get your feet moving, get your body going, and then once he made the read, he was able to make the play. >> Working out of the gun, Mayfield. There's a short one taken in by Uton and he'll go down inside the 45 before going out of bounds. >> Seven yds there and a first down. >> Buccaneers. >> Many different ways to create space, but on that play, he did it with that big wide body of his. Didn't get a whole lot of yardage on the play, but it did what it was supposed to. Pick up a first down. >> Baker going to give it to Irving. making the stop there, Denal Hunter. >> That's a really nice tough run inside and they gain five yards on it. And to be frank about it, most offenses don't expect to get five yards on a play call like that. So when they do, they go back to their huddle with a little pep in their steps. They're starting to think that they're starting to dominate the line of scrimmage. >> Running the toss to Irving and they went the wrong way there. losing yardage back at the 43 yd line. >> That's going to go down as a loss of five. And it brings up third down. >> Sometimes you just sit back and marvel at what he can do defensively. Speed, strength, quickness. He's the whole package. And that package just wrapped up the runner for a loss. >> The first down line at the 34 here on third down. Mayfield. Yeah, this pass broken up. >> Excellent coverage there on third down as that was not an easy one to hold on to. >> Anytime they think they've got him open beyond the markers, you know, they're going to throw it his way. And that's not going to change even after that incompletion was forced. >> So on fourth down on is Riley Dixon to punt for Tampa Bay. [Applause] And that'll skip out of bounds inside the 20 at the 17 yd line. >> 17. >> So out come the Texans for their opening drive >> and they will be led out by their 63 quarterback. >> And there's no doubt about the talent that we see from CJ Strad. We've watched it develop in his first two years in the league. But the best way quarterbacks are graded is winning. He's out there trying to win his third division championship in his many years. It's a sevenyd carry to set them up with a second and three. >> You often say that sort of opens the playbook now. Second and short. What do you think? Early shot here. >> I like where you're going. Obviously, we've been together for a while cuz you know me. I want to take that shot early and loosen things up. >> Back to Mixon on second down. And this one will go to the 28 yd line. >> Four yds. The pickup. First down. Sometimes I get almost mesmerized watching these runners who have great vision. You know those eyes that carry their feet to open spaces, make people miss. I just love watching those guys go to work. [Applause] >> Stra sets up the play action. He'll get this into the hands of Nico Collins >> and he'll be taken down but not before they work it across midfield. >> That one goes for 24 yds. >> First down. First and 10 at the 47 yd line. >> Well, from their point of view, this game could not be starting out much better, could it? Force a punt on defense and now they're moving it crisply on offense. >> Crisply. I like that. Yeah. Yeah. Moving it very, very well. Looks like the defense on their heels a little bit. You put a score in here, long way to go, but you're right, that's a heck of a start. >> Yeah, and I think this is where the play caller is looking at his play sheet and saying, "Dad, that dagger play that play just finish him off right now because I think they'd love to gain that big advantage early." >> Coming in to put a lick on it was Levante David. >> An interesting and intriguing decision there defensively because they kept extra DBs on the field despite seeing the multiple tight end look that came out for the offense. I thought they were going to switch out of it. I didn't know if they felt they didn't have time or what the case was. >> Well, in any event, the extra speed allowed for great penetration as they stuffed that one behind the line of scrimmage. >> Sprout's pass complete to number 13 Christian Kurt. It's a gain of six brings up third and five. [Applause] >> They'll come up facing third and five. throwing now is Stra. >> He's going to let this go back of the end zone >> toward the back corner of the end zone, but he could not get the feet down. This will wind up incomplete. >> And that's where you're counting on a receiver size being an advantage. They were hoping he could go over the top of a smaller DB and haul that one. >> Plenty of shouts from this crowd as they watch the replay. They want a challenge and they're going to get one. They're taking a peek at whether or not those feet were in bounds. And obviously a big call here in the end zone >> and not just the feet. How about the hands? How's the ball possessed while the feet are hopefully getting down in bounds? That's what they're trying to look at to see if it all comes together. >> So an early challenge and you know that those coaches hate to use those red flags too early, but this one turns out to be successful. >> The kick is good. Fair Baron good with the extra point and it's now a seven nothing game. [Applause] >> Fair Bear now to kick this one away [Applause] and he's up past the 20 to the 22 yd line. >> Tampa Bay, they're getting ready to set up shop here for their second drive. The last series form a little disappointing forced to punt and now they'll try to do better here and come away with some points as they begin this drive. First and 10 >> and this will leave him a yard short. Nice pick up of nine yds on first down. >> And his play caller does a nice job of giving him an easy throw to start this drive and he takes advantage of it. The completion sets up a manageable second down >> from the 31. Here comes second in a yard. Handoff running left. Irving and he tried to bounce it outside but they'll stop him behind the line. >> They'll wind up losing three and now it's third down. >> We all have habits. We can be somewhat predictable and you know me pretty well on second down and short. What I like to see >> play action. >> Yeah, without a doubt. I thought that was a great spot to call it. instead. Didn't go their way, did it? >> No. Defense sold out for the run. Worked out well. >> Mayfield from the gun on third down. >> Yeah, that one going to be knocked away and incomplete. >> Every offense tells you they want to come out and start fast. That's not unusual at all. But this group, they've yet to get much rolling through their first two drives. It looks like they're have to give up the football again after this one. Fourth down. So on is the punter Riley Dixon. >> Fair catch signal for and taken just shy of the 30 yd line. >> It'll be a 39 yd punt. No return >> and the Texans will take over. >> Straoud looking to throw. Throw over the middle is taken in by Dell. And he'll be taken down, but not before they reach the 50. >> Just like that, a pick up of 20 on their first play from scrimmage. >> First down. First and 10 at the 50 yd line. >> Well, as a coach, you absolutely love seeing your offense find their rhythm early, and that's exactly what we've seen so far. They had a touchdown on their opening drive and now they connect here for another nice gain for a first down. This offense is moving the ball well exactly as he drew it up in practice. >> Mixon with a first down carry and great blocking downfield as he's got this almost to the 35 yd line. >> Another good gain. That's now 35 yds combined on those last two plays. First and >> so they go pass, now they go run and two plays resulting in really nice pickups. >> Certainly sounds like a 50/50 deal, doesn't it? Sounds like great balance. Well, you know what all those coaches have told us over the years, Brandon, that balance is it means doing what you want to when you want to. That play call is working very well for them right now. >> Throw left sideline falls incomplete. >> Nice progress down the field was halted by that incompletion. They could try for some safe yards here to get things moving again or keep throwing it and pushing it down field to try and pick up bigger yardage. >> Here's second and 10. Here's Straoud to the sideline and incomplete. >> I don't want to blow it too out of proportion, but maybe circle this play because if they get the stop and hold them to a field goal here, that's a pretty good job. is already down on the scoreboard. >> A stop now would be vital for them because it could save them from having to do it multiple times later in the game in order to either get back into it or maybe have a chance to win. >> Straoud, he lets this one fly toward the back of the end zone. And this one dropped in the end zone. >> Oh, it looked like a touchdown, but not to be. And now it's fourth down. That's what you're going to need to do against those big receivers. You got to get in there and get physical with them. That time he got in close, got in tight, and knocked the ball away. >> So on fourth down, Texan kicker Ky Fair comes on. >> And quite a bit of pizza in this box. It's a 53 yd attempt. The kick by Fair is good. And that will extend their lead even further. >> Maybe a little bit of an anxious moment. there as that ball got closer and closer, but it does curl in. >> Yeah. Actually did a little bit of a slow dance there with the left upright, didn't it? But had just enough space, >> as you said, for it to curl in [Applause] >> and he'll go down as this drive will start at the 25 yd line. >> And Tampa Bay trots out there now. They'll look to get something started. They need to down 10 nothing early as they've got it first and 10 throwing Mayfield. He'll try and set up the screen. It's complete >> and he takes us up to the 40 yd line before being cored. >> 15 yds is the pick up there on the drive starting very nicely. First down. >> And that's not a play that you see all that often at the start of a drive, but some teams they don't mind doing it. And that one well sold by the offensive lineman. They showed the pass and then they got out into space able to get some good blocks downfield and allow the play to be successful. >> Yeah, he'll be pretty well stopped in his tracks. Give him a yard up to the 42. >> That felt like a trap cuz it looked to me like the opposing front was on that play from the get-go. They had everyone crashing the ball carrier before he even made the line and they hold him to just a yard. >> Second down and eight. from the gun. Mayfield open man is IA >> and he'll be taken down but not before he works it past the 50. >> That'll be a pick up of 10 as they try to recover from this 10-point deficit. >> You can almost hear the sigh of relief coming from their sideline and from their point on the field because this has been a tough start for them thus far. A much needed first down there. They needed something good to happen. Plays like that will continue to help him dig out of this hole. >> Play action now. Here's Mayfield. It's caught by Mike Evans and he gets it inside the 35 and just shy of the 30. >> Another nice gain. 16 yds there and a first down again. And >> time to give some credit to the big fellas, the offensive line here, because you've got to have good protection on crossing routes because you got to give your receiver time to work all the way across the field. That time be able to scan the field, spot his receiver moving left to right and make a good accurate throw. Thank you guys. >> To throw Mayfield firing quickly here and that's complete. It'll be a gain of just a yard >> and that'll make it second down. >> As a defense, you're more balanced when you're in zone coverage because you're able to keep your eyes on the quarterback and see the play develop in front of you. They're able to keep the quick pass in front of them and stop it right at the line of scrimmage. >> In motion right Evans, >> Mayfield looks to throw across the formation. He finds Godwin. >> And when you're playing a quarterback with some experience and some moxy, >> you enter the danger zone when you decide to blitz him because if he's able to diagnose, as he did on that play, he can hurt you downfield. >> He reads defenses so well, doesn't he? >> He really does. And the best part about that play for him, I don't think that was his primary target. >> I don't think so either. >> I think he had the read, figured out where the blitz was coming from, and went to a secondary target for a really nice game. on the play. >> He'll wind up getting two there as he does it himself and picks up the first. >> There may have been a little bit of an element of surprise there. Third and inches and they go quarterback sneak. I still feel like this is a play that often is reserved for fourth down. >> Straight ahead. It's Irving and just a couple yards there down to the 17. >> Well, they didn't get a whole lot out of that one. But I think you got to continue to try and run and try and keep the defense honest. So just sit back, dare you to throw it on every down. >> Yeah, you get your quarterback hit a lot that way, too. >> So from the 17, here's second and seven. >> Here's Mayfield. Now he'll dump it underneath to his running back. Complete. >> It's a 10 yd gain there to set him up first and goal. >> And coming into this ball game, this was an offense that wasn't just talking about the notion of ball control. They were preaching it. They wanted to win the time of possession battle and they've done so here. This drive's taken up quite a bit of the first quarter. Now they are set up first and goal. >> Mayfield now. This is caught and in for the Buccaneers touchdown to number 14 >> Chris Godwin from six yds away >> and the Bucks have cut it back within a score. >> As they began this last drive, things weren't exactly looking up for this offense. But after what they just did, putting the ball in the end zone, that took him away from the brink of possibly being knocked out of this game. Chase Mclofflin on for the extra point >> and they're back with it a field goal. It's 107 now. >> Tex 10. >> So that one a pretty timeconsuming 10play drive >> and it's Chris Godwin who finishes things off with a touchdown reception. [Applause] Following the touchdown, here's Mclofflin to kick off. >> Oh, good move. >> And he takes this near the 25. Just a little pass there. Called it the 26. >> The Texans back out there and ready to go. >> And they split the uprights last time for three. They've got the lead. They're not going to play this conservative. They're not hoping for another field goal. They're hoping for a touchdown. >> I'm with you on that one. I like where your head is. I like the way you're thinking because you're exactly right. Trying to sit on a lead and play that way, that doesn't work too well for most teams. Run your offense. Run what you do best. >> Exactly. Put it all the way down and try and increase your lead in a big way. The best way to do it. >> Touchdowns. >> Nothing fancy there. A little smashmouth football right up the gut on the dive and it turns into a huge play. You talk about the fastest way to the secondary. Right up the gut as you described and sprinted into the secondary for a long long run. >> Open man is Kirk complete >> and taking it to the 15 yd line before he's brought down. >> 10 yds there. Good enough for a Texan first down. >> Another nice play there. They've gotten down into the red zone in no time at all. That's what this offense can do when they get on a roll and now they're set up with a first and 10. [Applause] Inside hand off to Mixon >> and he is met at the line of scrimmage and he goes down right there. >> Leavante David. >> Levante David in on the tackle. >> Defensively we always know that he is tough in run support and I think the way that he gets there is he understands what an offense is going to do before the ball's even snapped. a great job of scouting prior to the game, then reading reacting and taking the right path to the ball carrier. >> Now a first carry for their fullback and he swallowed up right near the line of scrimmage. >> No gain on the play there, so that doesn't help. Now they're looking up at a third and nine situation. >> They'll come to the line here needing nine yards to pick up the first. Back to throw. Here's Straoud. >> And this pass broken up. >> The contact well timed there. And now fourth down. >> That's absolutely going to fire this defense up. They made it their mission to deny that completion and they came through with a nice hit and knocked it incomplete. What are we doing? >> Kaimi Fairbear now to attempt the Texan field goal >> from the left hash. A 31 yd attempt. >> Fairbear able to put this one through >> and the lead stretches to six here. It's 13-7. >> So they're able to end that drive with three points in this onep possession ball game. >> And ideally you want to end every drive with points. Most quarterbacks would tell you, "Let's end it with a kick." Right? A PAT. That's number one. Field goal. You'll take punts. You really don't want to do that. In this case, they'll take the field goal and get prepared for the rest of the game. >> The solid stiff arm >> and he'll get it up past the 20 to about the 22. >> Now, the Buccaneer offense gets set to take over. >> This drive here beginning probably with a pair of motivated groups. Remember the offense scored a touchdown on their last time out. Looking to repeat that in Charles's defense. They were very frustrated after giving up six the last time on the field. >> And frankly, it's just a battle of wills in a lot of ways because, you know, they're both motivated. They both game plan for this drive and they both have specific outcomes in mind. To me, it just comes down to who can execute better and which side can step up and assert its will over the other. An entertaining start to this one. More to come on EA Sports. Second quarter now and it's Buccaneer football as they've got it with a second and three forthcoming. A shotgun handoff here to Irving and he still has yet to get on track in this first half as they're going to stop him behind the line. It'll go down as a two-yd loss and it brings up a third down. The running lanes have definitely not been there for him here in the first half and I don't think it's all been his fault. His offensive line hasn't given him much space. A loss results there >> from the shotgun. It's Mayfield and he'll be hit as he releases it and that'll fall incomplete. >> Partner, what we're seeing so far as a defense is certainly coordinated. Both levels doing their jobs in tandem. The back helping the front, the front helping the back. The pressure got home on that last play and forced him to try and throw through contact and short of the sticks. >> Riley Dixon now to put it away. [Applause] He's been a busy man here in this first half as he gets it away. Here's Barios. >> 42 yd punt. Six on the return. And the Texans will take over with a first and 10. The Texans offense and running back Joe Mixon set to take over once more. Houston's offense already at the line set to get going. And last time they got three points, but it was a chip shot field goal. And when you go to the sideline after a chip shot field goal, maybe the offense not too happy. >> It's a balancing act, isn't it? Because you're exactly right. They're none too pleased that they didn't punch it in for six points. But they also have to remember they did put points on the board. >> Three points is three points. >> And in this league, you take points when you can get them. Not easily done >> from the 38. Now here comes second and eight. Once again, they run with Mixon. And hard running is going to get him over the 40 to the 42. >> When you find that kind of yardage, you couldn't be more confident as a ball carrier. And guess what? You're going to go back and tell your offensive coordinator, I'd like to keep carrying it. Thank you. >> Here is third down and four. [Applause] >> It's Strad now to throw. That's going to be caught by Kirk. >> And he appears to be about 2 ft short on third and three. Leaves him with a fourth and one. >> If this were baseball, we'd call this small ball. Instead of pushing it downfield, they throw a short pass trying to pick up the first down, but the defense rallies to the football and stops him short, bringing up a fourth down. >> On is the punter Townson as he gets this one away. and he couldn't get it to check up. That kicks all the way into the end zone for a touchback. The Buccaneers getting ready to go as they take the field. >> The crowd maybe losing just a little bit of the edge after backto-back punts. >> They want some big plays. They want to see some offense. They want to see somebody break away, whether it's through the air or on the ground. Now, it'll be interesting to see where the patience is on both sides. each head coach. Can you hang in there and not try and force something that could put your team in some jeopardy? >> Now second and seven from the 23. >> They'll send a receiver here in motion right. Mayfield to throw it over the middle into traffic and that's complete. >> Third catch of this first half for him and this one is a first down. He kept the receiver in the short field, but that let his quarterback get the ball quickly to him before either guy in double coverage could react. >> So they'll come up first and 10 now from the 33. A run up the middle with Irving and there just continues to be nowhere to run. He's bottled up again at the line of scrimmage. >> Call it no gain on the play and it'll be second down. at the 33 yd line. [Applause] >> Now Mayfield, >> he's got his receiver. That's Ibuka. >> And getting this just shy of midfield. They'll spot it at the 49. >> Catch number four for him on the afternoon and it'll give him a first down. Swear I'm leaving the city and don't score. >> An ex teammate used to tell me all the time, I hate experienced quarterbacks because no matter what, you really can't hide what you're doing. And I think that right there, he knew right away where the blitz was coming from, where his primary guy was going to be, and he ended up going to a secondary target for a nice game. >> I was just going to ask you, that wasn't the primary target. He's So, and he's going to go down. The Texans come at him and able to bring him to the ground. >> That was Will Anderson getting home and finishing the play. >> And every game we talk about what are going to be the keys as we go into it. Maybe that's a key for their defense today. Pressure the quarterback and make sure you play a good zone defense behind them and they get their first sack of the contest. Got to assume this defense will be charging again here. It's second and 15. >> Another try after the first down sack. Mayfield and he's able to get this one out closer to midfield across the 45. >> Calling a gain of three on the play >> and they'll be facing a third and 12. >> And there's a completion to the tight end. And look at the size of these players nowadays at that spot. 6'4, 6'5 and up. A lot of guys used to be basketball players somehow came back to football. That's really good for the game of football. You're getting better athleticism, great hand eye coordination, guys who know how to control their bodies when they run their routes. >> And he is going to have the Buccaneers first down as they're able to get the third down conversion. >> That's a play that'll likely be forgotten when you talk about big moments in this game. But plays like this are critical to keep drives going. And if points result, we'll call this play significant. >> So a first and 10 now in Houston territory at the 39 yd line. >> Oh, nice move and nothing but green grass here. Middle of the field. Touchdown Tampa Bay. >> Touchdown Tampa Bay. >> Bucky Irving. 39 yds. And the Bucks have tied the ball game with a chance to take the lead. >> Well, they done a pretty good job keeping him in check to that point, but he finally breaks off a nice run here and gets into the end zone. >> And it just takes one, doesn't it, partner? That can undo a lot of good work that a defense has done to that point. You break off one right there and everything suddenly looks bad for you. [Applause] Mclofflin now to add the pat >> and this puts him on top by a penny. It's 1413 Buccaneers 14. >> So that drive in total eight plays and the finishing touch was that nice long run into the end zone. Following the touchdown, here's Mclofflin to kick off. And the tackle going to be made right there at the 25 yd line. >> The football going back over now to the Houston Texans. And Charles, a very uninspired effort. The last time we saw them out there was a quick threeand out. Then they punted the football. >> Yeah. Man, you never want to get stopped so soundly during a series. But what would be even worse now is letting it happen again right here. They've got to get going. >> Assan Reic coming through with a stop there and a tackle for loss to boot. >> They have three tight ends in that formation. That's almost a universal sign that they're planning to run the football. But how about the defense there? They met force with force and caused a stack up behind the line of scrimmage and threw him for a loss. >> So the opening play of the drive goes backwards. Now they'll come up on second and 12. >> Now Straoud >> and Straoud wisely slides down safely after picking up the first down. >> That one a broken play but it ends up being a good play. The scramble goes for 20. >> First and 10 at the 43 yd line. I am willing to bet that he got a monster grin on his face when he saw what was happening. Man covers are so committed to denying a big throw that it pulled attention away from him and he had an easy lane to hit and hit it he did. Strong to throw it. Got a man. It's Collins complete >> and he'll be taken down but not before he gets into enemy territory. Another >> another strong gain on the last two plays. They've moved it a combined 33 yd >> 46 yd line. >> So from Buccaneer territory now it's first and 10 at the 46 [Applause] mixing up the middle as he's got this down inside the 40 to the 39. >> 85 yds rushing for him as he has been tough to stop here this first half. Well, no matter how they phrase it, staying on schedule, staying ahead of the sticks, whatever you want to call it, seven yds on first down, that fits the bill. >> Ball on the 39. Here's second and three. >> Again, it's Mixon and he is met in his tracks behind the line of scrimmage. >> Two yards the loss and now they go from second and two to a tough third and four. and four. >> Well, with the kind of half he's had, I think we can forgive him that run, right? Not every run's going to be a big play, is it? >> No. And also, the blocking just wasn't there. No room to run. >> Yeah. Defensively, they got to find a way to build on that because he's eating them alive in the first half. >> And that's going to be too high. Out of bounds and incomplete. >> Zone coverage there. And they were playing deep. That makes it obviously a little bit harder to run by guys. And that time there's not much of a window to get the ball in there and it winds up incomplete. [Music] >> So coming on now is the field goal unit. They're going to try for three and he'll need all the leg he's got here. >> And that is no good. >> And that'll keep this a one-point game. >> Well, Brandon, anything beyond 50, you start rolling the dice a bit. And once you get up around 57 58 yards, the chances of making it go down dramatically. And sure enough, this one winds up no good. >> The Buccaneers offense and Baker Mayfield set to take over once more. And he's done everything you could have asked for coming in. He's spread it around. He hasn't taken many chances and he's potentially on his way to a big game throwing the football. The Bucks offense set to begin their next possession. The last time out they had to march almost the full length of the field for their touchdown. So here much easier Charles with this better starting field position. >> I love your sarcasm, but I love even more your observation because look what they did last time out now with a shorter field. They should have a lot of confidence that they're going to put more points up on the board. >> They'll run. This is Irving and he'll get it down here to the 43. Two yards good enough for a first. >> Not too many more ideal situations at second and two in order to try and pick up a first down. They ran it and picked it up. [Applause] >> They go with a shuffle pass and it's complete. be a gain of five. >> And it's second down. >> Nice rhythm throw there on first down. He located his tight end, made a nice easy pitching catch. >> Hoping he can break a tackle or two. Wasn't able to do that there, but still good yardage. Here's second and five now from the 37. He'll look to throw and that is incomplete. A lot of force bearing down on him there. He could not hang on. And it's third down. >> Good defensive call right there because they had someone shadowing him along his entire route and he was right there ready to provide a hit that prevents him from making another catch to his big start. >> The Bucks on third down. Two for five to this point. This will be third and five. Mayfield and is caught and he's brought down but not before he reaches the 8 yd line. They're able to convert on third down and that sets up a first and goal. [Applause] >> Good strong throw and catch right there. And so far in this game, the alleys have been open for them to get completions and they're taking advantage of it. >> The chain gang hustling to catch up. Here's first and goal from just inside the 10. They'll throw again. Here's Mayfield. >> And a quick throw here. That's complete. >> Three yds is the gain that time. Second and goal. >> He decided to run a hitch rout. It really helped to have a guy who can turn it loose. And boy, he rifled one in there on that one. Not much run after catch, but it worked really well. >> Two of their three red zone trips so far they've come up empty on. They'll look to reverse that trend on second and goal. Working out of the gun. Mayfield to the end zone, but it's incomplete. >> I see the surprise in your face there, partner. That is a rare incompletion from him. He's been on point this entire game. >> He has percentage completion wise way up. Not that time. >> A big play forthcoming. Here's third and goal. [Applause] >> They'll stick with the passing game as he looks to throw. He had a man open but he missed him and it's incomplete. >> He came through well with a nice pass break up there. Fortunate that he was on the spot. He's the only guy left to prevent the first down. >> Chase Mclofflin now for the field goal try >> from the right hash and this one just to chip it. Oh, they get to the football. It's blocked. Got to say, Charles, a little surprising to have a kick this short blocked. Usually that happens on the longer ones, but great job by the special teams to kind of sift through there and get a hand on it. >> Yeah, you've seen a lot of football over time, partner, and you're right about it. Typically, the longer field goals start lower because they have so much more ground to cover to get to the post and that's when you get a hand on it. These short ones, you're able to pop it up in the air pretty quickly. Normally, you get height. in this case. Extra effort to block that one. >> And he's got it past the 30 before he's hit and dropped. >> That play going for 16 yds to start the drive. First down. >> First down. >> And what a nice example there of a tight end doing exactly what he needs to do. How about how he worked his way to the outside, made sure he secured the catch, and then anything after that, we count that as a bonus. And indeed, he gets enough for the first down. A hand off to Mixon. >> Now he's free at the 35. Joe Mixon. And he'll take this one in for a Texans touchdown. >> Joe Mixon 66 yds. And the Texans take the block field goal and convert it into six points. And on that long run, maybe the defense caught napping a little bit. >> The concentration level may not have been there. I agree with you on that one because those types of plays when they result like that, they're almost like big bolts of lightning, aren't they? Whoosh. And off he goes >> on for the patar. [Music] >> And that'll make this a six-point game. So, two plays on that scoring drive. That's how they drew it up. >> And the long run into the end zone. And what a run it was. [Applause] >> So, after the touchdown, here's Fairbear now to kick it away. [Applause] And a good return as he'll be stopped just shy of the 30 yd line. >> So out come the Bucks now. >> Last time they had a little bit of a special teams breakdown. That field goal was blocked. >> Yeah. And everything has to be precise in the kicking game. Snap, hold, kick. Obviously the blocking to keep people out. So what you really want to do is get in there and get six points and take the pressure off of those guys. >> Yeah. He tries to keep the legs churning, but he's going to be stopped behind the line. at the 27. >> Pretty straightforward play there by the linebacker. He saw the run, went with straight ahead pursuit and dumped him behind the line of scrimmage. >> A three- yd loss to start the drive. They'll look to make that up and then some on second and 13. They'll look to throw and that'll be incomplete. >> Took a pretty good shot as he tried to pull that one in. Couldn't hang on. Third down. It's third. >> He did an okay job of absorbing the hit, just couldn't secure the football through the catch. >> And he was right there on the spot and forced the incompletion. That's something defenders work on all the time. If you're there, make the contact, but continue to work your way through the receiver so that you can't possess the football and turn it into a catch. >> Oh, this is taken in. It's complete. >> And he has a big gain inside the 40 before being dropped. They chalk that one up as a gain of 34 on third down. >> Buccaneers. [Music] [Applause] And we've hit the two-minute mark in this first half of action. So from the 39 now they'll come up on a first and 10. Play fake Mayfield and they will only muster a yard here to the 38. They made a nice effort to stick him with a loss for that play, but it's going to take more than that to keep him from advancing the ball. Should be an entertaining battle anytime he tucks and runs over the second half of this contest. >> 38 yd line. Second and nine. [Applause] Here's a hand off to Irving and he works free. 51 yds rushing for now in the ball game. This drive is turning into an extended one and and the guy carrying the ball, he's becoming more like a body blows guy. Every carry is putting some damage on the defense. So, after a while, I'm not too sure how many guys going to want to run up and tackle him. >> Third and two. >> Back to throw. Pass taken in by his big tight end. and he's going to be taken down with another first down as the stops made at the Texans 18. >> What a drive this has been. Just chewing up the yardage. And here's one of their best plays yet as they finally get down into the red zone and look to finish this off with six. So from inside the 20, here's first and 10 at the 18. That's complete to his receiver Godwin. So the completion results there in nine yards >> and that'll give him a short yardage situation here for second down. >> Brings up second and a yard at the 9 yd line. [Applause] They run out of the gun with Irving. >> The Bucks going to go ahead and use the second of their timeouts >> as they'll stop it with a little over 30 seconds to go in the first half of play. >> How about that there? No frills, no additives, right? Nothing crazy. Just find a way to pick up the first down. A nice run right there. So, it's first and goal and a great opportunity to get that lead back before the break >> throwing Mayfield. His pass caught at the four. >> Three yds is the gain that time. Second and goal. >> They gave up the completion there, but this is what zone defenses count on. catching the ball and not much run after the catch. >> Second and goal from inside the five. >> Back to throw here and this is incomplete with a clock showing just three seconds left. >> To this point, I've been impressed with the work defensively. They have not allowed a lot of receivers to run free. And there's another example, another incompletion. >> So 3 seconds here remain in the half on the field goal unit to see about getting three points. >> He had his lone attempt blocked earlier and his kick is right there. It's good. >> And that cuts the lead down to just three. 20- 17. >> So this time the protection holds up for him just fine. And he's able to bang it through. >> I think their special teams coach got the point across. He gave him a pretty good ear pull after the block earlier and this time there's no penetration. So they're able to pick up three. >> So still time for the kickoff here. One second to go in the half as this one is away. >> And not wanting to risk anything here late in the half. He'll just take a knee and they'll bring the football out to the 25. The Texans offense ready to go here for their next drive. And from this spot in the field with the clock where it's at, you think we're just going to see a knee and that's it. >> And I think in this situation, that's the proper play. But we do know there's some risk takers out there that may want to take one more shot before the clock runs out. All right, Brandon, thanks much. Scott Hansen with you from the EA Studios in Orlando. This has been a heck of a game so far. Just a field goal separating these two squads. You have to imagine both sides are trying to figure out how to clean things up and put some touchdowns up in the second half. Let's find out what goes on in the third quarter. Back out to the stadium and our broadcast team, Brandon Goden and Charles. >> All right, Scott. Great work as always. We'll see what the second half brings here. These two defensive coordinators probably scratching their heads at intermission. These offenses, they have had their way so far. and he'll be stopped up at the 25. >> The Texans going to take over here to start quarter number three and they've got the lead, CD. What do you expect from them in this second half? >> Well, I like what they were able to do on the ground in the first half because they had a lot of success running the ball and I certainly think we'll see more of that. But I keep an eye on that defense and I think their coaches up in the box will do the exact same thing. If they start to see one or two guys start to creep towards the line of scrimmage, >> that'll be licensed to take some shots downfield. >> I feel like I could see what he was thinking on that carry. Wanted to follow that big tackle through the hole. Ended up only getting four yards on the carry. I think he had designs on that one being bigger. >> Second down. Here's Chub again. and he stopped immediately there. >> A loss on that play and now third down gets tougher. Third and six. >> That's what this defense is going to need to do more in the second half. Good pressure that time forces some indecision in the back field. He's going to wind up being taken down for a nice loss. >> Here's third and six. [Applause] >> Throwing now is Straoud. working in the middle of the field and he's got a man complete and he is going to have a Texans first down as they're able to get the third down conversion. >> Good for a Houston Texans. >> First and 10 at the 48 yd line. [Applause] throwing quickly. This is caught by Kirk. >> So, just three yards on the completion there >> and that'll bring up second down. >> The goal of a wide receiver screen is get enough blockers in front to create a wall and let him pick his spot to run the football. How about the defense there swarming to it and not allowing that to happen did not let him get downfield. [Applause] Straoud >> and a dangerous throw there as that's knocked down and >> incomplete. >> That's not the first time they've gone his way on this drive and they were obviously keyed into him because they were there to help break that pass up. >> They head to the line facing a third and seven following the incompletion on second down. The throwing again is Straoud. >> He'll drop this one down to Mixon and he is going to have a Texans first down as they're able to get the third down conversion. >> And the Texans first down. >> Got that look from you there, partner. I think we're on the same page on that one. Just his first catch. I think we both thought he'd be a little more active in the passing game. Let's see if that's the start of them trying to get the ball to him a little bit more here in the second half. >> Here's a give to Mixon >> and just no chance of turning the corner. He can only get back to the line of scrimmage. >> Second and 10 coming up >> that time. They're able to bottle him up, but he's having a really nice game. >> I agree with that. Let's just go big picture, right? Every back that's in the Hall of Fame had carries where they didn't gain yardage or they lost yardage, but you stick with them, don't you? When they're having a good game, keep feeding them. >> Back to Mixon on second down. And for one of the few times here today, this run's not going to go anywhere. >> Two runs in a row, but only two yards to show for it. >> He's having a big game running the football, but that one will hurt the yards per carry a little bit. >> Yeah, but the average he's got so far, that's the type of average he wants to take with him to contract negotiations, doesn't he? >> Here's Straoud. And that is incomplete. >> So, two third down conversions on this drive, but not able to get a third. And now they deal with fourth down. >> That's a good piece of quarterbacking right there because he certainly felt the pressure coming. The alternative getting sacked for the first time. He didn't like that option at all. Did a nice job saving yardage by throwing that one away. >> So, now on comes the field goal unit. And wow, this is no ordinary try here. The kick by Fair Baron is good and that will double their lead as it's up to six. >> Buccaneers. >> Well, looking at it from a defensive perspective, that keeps the deficit very, very manageable. You know, all things considered, not a bad job on the defensive side. >> I would say that you've pointed out something pretty good right there, and that is you actually have both sides happy with that exchange. You know, happy in quotes, of course. >> One team, hey, we've kept it kept it within range. the other side saying, "Hey, we put points on the board and did stretch out the lead." Let's see how this one turns out. >> Yeah. Still bottom line though, three points for the opening drive of the third quarter. >> The Buccaneers offense and their quarterback set to take the field once more >> and he's been a nightmare to scheme against throughout this one. This defense has been totally taken apart and that is borne out in his numbers. He's been terrific all game long. They'll start on the ground with Irving and nothing much materializing there on the first down run. He'll get a couple and that's it. >> Certainly a nice job there by the defense rallying to the football and getting him on the ground, but I think the play gets made by the defensive front because if they can't get up field, their job is to go ahead and get low almost getting into a ball sometimes, stack things up and make it difficult for the runner to find a hole. >> They'll stay on the ground with Irving. A little juke >> and able to break one tackle but then quickly brought down but a nice little gain. >> 62 yds rushing for him now to this point. >> He had to fight for every yard on that run. Shook himself free of a tackle and kept fighting even with the rest of the defense closing in on it. That's the kind of effort you'll take every single time. Mayfield going to take it on the sneak >> and he is going to have a box first down as they're able to get the third down conversion. [Music] >> Well, they pick it up on third and one on the quarterback sneak and that's not easily done because there are extra bodies in there on the defensive side and they're moving forward at the snap. >> Yeah, I was certainly expecting a handoff, weren't you? >> Yeah, I totally was. I thought they'd go with a back, maybe try and get a lead blocker in front. But as you talk about in different games, those guys with confidence in their offensive line, they just want to move forward and get it. >> First down Tampa Bay there, a gain of 13. >> I like watching the wide receiver screen cuz it's a real teamwork play because guess what? The guy catching the ball, he'll get all the credit, but how about the people have to block in front of him, either fellow receivers or offensive linemen. That makes that play a really nice timing play and sometimes it can break big. >> On first and 10, here's Irving. >> And down inside the 40 to about the 38. >> It's a gain of seven on the ground. Second down coming up. >> Good yardage there on first down. Exactly what you want. Get yourself set up to keep making first downs. Keep the clock running. And if they're smart, you're starting to milk the clock. No hurry before you run your second down play. Play action now. Here's Mayfield. This one taken in byton. It'll be a pick up of four. Good enough to earn him yet another first down. Fifth catch of the game for him there. >> Yeah. And the tight end position is now becoming a volume pass catcher. Used to be occasional, right? Safety valve. Throw one to him every so often, but mainly they want him out there to block. nowadays an integral part of the passing game and they create such great mismatches that they often become the leading receiver >> and that going to be incomplete. Too tough to hold on to that one. It's second down. >> And partner to me that one was all about timing. If he's there too early, it's going to be a pass interference call. If he's too late, it's a completed pass. He was Johnny on the spot on that one. >> Now a second and 10. Mayfield looks to throw >> and this is caught by >> Evansfield's pass >> and he'll be marked down at the 26 with a gain of seven gain of seven yd and it's third down. >> Play number nine set to come here on the drive on third and two. Mayfield with it once more. >> Oh, he had him. He was open, but he couldn't get it to him. It's incomplete. >> The coverage keyed in on him since that last completion his way. He earned a little more attention on that route, and that made it a lot tougher to get a clean throw his way. >> The decision for Todd Bulls and he says, "Let's go for it." On fourth down from the shotgun, it's Mainfield. He's got his target. That's complete >> and he'll be taken down, but he does have first down yardage. >> A solid pick up of five and a very solid fourth down conversion. And defensively pure frustration. So after the conversion on fourth, here's first and 10 just outside of the red zone. Mayfield to throw it. Looking for Godwin and he's got him complete. >> Just a gain of a couple there. >> Headed second down. >> A twoyd gain brings up second down at the 18 yd line. >> Mayfield on play action. Sliding out of the pocket. And now they're inside the 10 as he's brought down at the nine. >> Mayfield showing he can be fleet of foot picking up the first down. >> Oh, partner just a second earlier and they might have had him because they certainly thought they were going to close in and drop him behind the line of scrimmage, but he had just enough time to dodge the pressure and he ends up getting yardage before being stopped. to throw Mayfield and that one off the mark behind him. Incomplete. A time called here because a member of the Texans is in some discomfort. So, as the medical staff takes a look, we'll step aside. another shot from the nine on second and goal. >> Baker going to give it to Irving and he maneuvers his way down to the three yd line. 77 yds for him on the ground now as he has been terrific here this afternoon. >> When you look at the geography we're staring at this part of the field, don't you always think of big backs carrying the football, bruisers trying to pound it in. Instead, we look at a little more of a scatback type and he's trying to make it happen. >> Yeah, they went with the elusive slippery guy. Couldn't get in there though. >> And he's into the end zone. Touchdown Buccaneers. >> Baker Mayfield taking it in from two yds out. And the Bucks are an extra point away from taking the lead. What an effort there. Sometimes you hold your breath a bit when you see your quarterback diving for the end zone. You don't want him to land on a shoulder wrong or take a big shot. But he looks none the worst for wear here. And that winds up a touchdown. [Applause] for the extra point. [Applause] >> And that one puts them on top here in the third. >> Buccaneers. >> That drive a long one spanning 15 plays and it ends with a three yd scoring run. >> Scott, we thank you as always and we'll see what happens here in the second half. Both teams trying to find the right formula to come out with the victory. kickoff for the Buccaneers. >> Oh, what a move. >> And he returns this to the 22. >> Joe Mixon and the rest of his offense making their way back onto the field. He's had a good performance. Move the ball effectively on the ground. Of course, he has the one touchdown. >> And when you're able to move it as effectively as you've described, that leads to finding a way into the end zone. And now he's just trying to do it for a second time. And of course with that comes additional yardage. >> Yeah. Looking for additional yardage. And again that second score here in the third quarter. >> Two yards the loss. Second and 12. >> Well that was one of the few times they've been able to contain him thus far. He's over 100 yardds for the game but he lost a bit off his total on that carry. >> First play of the drive goes the wrong way. Here's second and 12. >> Back to throw. Here's Straoud. They'll set up the screen here to Mixon >> and he'll get to the 29 yd line. Brought down there. >> It'll be a pick up of eight on the screen and it sets up a third down. >> Partner like the play call coming right after a tackle for a loss because this is an obvious passing situation, but instead they fooled him a little bit with the screen and they wound up getting back what they lost and then a little bit more. >> Stra to throw it. That went behind his man. Incomplete. >> Well, how about the coverage we just saw him break out on third down. Dime defense blanketed the field with extra defensive backs and speed >> unable to find an open hole to complete that pass. The Texans send the punter out >> as he'll kick it away for the second time >> and the fair catch is made at about the 27 yd line. >> A 40 yd punt. No return >> and the Bucks will get ready to go on offense. >> Now Mayfield and the Bucks come up on first and 10 at their own 28 yd line. They'll try and start this drive in the air. >> There's a short one taken in by Uton and only able to get two here. Stopped at the 30. >> Well, the strategy was evident there. Get it to your tight end and make it a one-on-one play with a cornerback. Who's usually going to win that one? >> The tight end, but not there. >> Not in this situation. How about the corner defeating that logic and making a really nice tackle? Mayfield >> finding Aton once more. >> Call it a gain of six on the play and it makes it third down and two yards to go. >> And there wasn't much room for the big tight end to do much after the catch. But Leasey was able to pick up a solid gain to help his offense continue to move in the right direction. >> They'll come to the line needing only two yards to gain the first here. working out of the gun. Mayfield >> and he'll have it past midfield almost to the 40 before being taken down. >> Able to find a lot of empty space there. Picking up the first down at a 21 yd gain. >> Remember Brandon, he ran for a touchdown earlier. So his decision to go ahead and tuck it and go again turned out to be a wise one. >> And the decision is what is important here. He has made some good decisions on when to tuck it and go. [Applause] >> Play fake. Mayfield under pressure and the Texans able to get in there for the sack. >> And Denil Hunter, he's the one who gets in there and brings him down to the ground. We've seen how this quarterback can beat you with his legs. Saw it earlier on this drive as a matter of fact. But that time they had him covered. >> They really gave him no place to escape because often times they're able to find a crack, a sliver, anything that can get them up field. On that occasion, nothing open at all and they swarmed him. >> Don't need it all back at once, but you figure they're going to need something here. 17 yds to go on second down. He's got his receiver. That's a pass. >> And that was yardage that they needed there after the sack on first down. They didn't get all of it back, but now they look at third down as a manageable situation. One that they have a much better chance of picking up. >> Third and four. >> Here's Mayfield flush to his right. [Applause] And down he goes taking it inside the 10 just shy of the five at the six. >> Big yardage there on the scramble and gets him a first down. >> Bottom line is that he is just something else as a runner because there are not many QBs in this league who can rip off a game that big. And he did it with the defense. Give him a little extra attention after he hit him on a run earlier this series. >> And now Mayfield on the boot leg. Throw left side complete. That's Evans. Mike, >> he'll get only two there and it's second and goal. >> Brings up second and goal at the four yd line. >> Mayfield now >> and it's caught. A minimal gain there on the eighth play of the drive. >> Not a big window to throw. Coverage wasn't too bad there. >> Yeah, they had him under wraps pretty well, but somehow able to muscle his way open and catch the ball. [Music] >> Big play coming here. It's third and goal. >> Oh, there's that man again. It's complete. And he'll maybe get back to the line of scrimmage, but no more than that. >> Just shy of the goal line. No gain on the play. It's now fourth and goal. >> So with a fourth and goal looming, we hit the end of three quarters of play. You are watching the NFL on EA Sports. Back now in Houston. This one's still anybody's ball game. It's a one-point difference here as we begin the fourth quarter play. Mayfield to throw for it on fourth and Evans hauls it in. Touchdown Bucks Evans touchdown. A one-yd touchdown pass and the Buccaneers get an important score there to extend their lead here in this fourth quarter. >> Well, that's just how they drew it up. CD, his first read was there. Got it to him quickly and into the end zone. >> Absolutely excellent execution by all involved. And the coordinator, got to give him credit, found the perfect play call. Quarterback let it fly as soon as the target came free. and his guy hit a nice gap. Just how you draw it up in practice and then execute it in the game. >> Extra point by Mclofflin is up and good. >> And that will ensure that it will take a touchdown and a two-point conversion to tie it. >> Chase McLolin >> following the touchdown. Here's Mclofflin to kick off. unable to corral him. He fights through >> and they'll get him down inside the 30 at the 27. >> The Texans offense and their running back getting set to go once more and he has put in a full game's work and then some. Just an incredible performance on the ground to this point in the fourth quarter. Houston's offense already at the line set to get going. Still plenty of time here in the fourth quarter. Just a onepossession game down eight. They'll be looking for the touchdown and two-point conversion. A field goal here on this drive does very little at this stage. >> This possession means so much for them. They've got to focus on this drive and find a way to make this a one possession game. Got to get a score. >> Yeah. So good with a field goal. Don't necessarily need a touchdown. >> Out of the shotgun. They run with Mixon. >> And he's going to be met at the line of scrimmage and taken down. He got maybe a half yard at most, but officially they'll be left with a third and two. >> The Texans on third down. They've struggled to the tune of two for eight so far. This time they face a third and two. Jumps it off to Mixon. >> And they're going to mark him down short, maybe by about a yard if that. a yard. So, the completion gets him just a yard and that'll bring up fourth down. >> Always important as a defender on third down to keep the play in front of you and make sure you don't give up enough space that they can make a move on you in the open field. >> Try as he might, he wasn't able to get to the first down marker. Excellent defense. Good tackling. >> Fair catch called for and made at the 16 or maybe the 17 yd line. >> The visitors offense and their quarterback headed out for this next possession. And this defense might be about ready to wave the white flag. Nothing they have tried to throw at him has been that successful. He just processes things so quickly and makes a right read seemingly every time. >> It's a short one here complete to his tight end >> and he'll be taken down but not before he gets this football out shy of the 30 to the 29. >> Well, it may seem a little unorthodox to some people. Got the lead fourth quarter yet he's still firing away. I think he believes that's the best way to go ahead and win the game. >> Yeah. A lot of coaches say, "Let's just run the football, be conservative." He's sticking to his game plan. >> No, that is his game and that's what they're going to ride. >> 17 yds on the play at a Buccaneer. First down. >> He was brought down by Kayn Bullock. >> It's a gain of 17 yds. >> First down Tampa Bay. [Music] No doubt those are the types of carries they're looking for here, Charles. The lead in the fourth quarter. This is when coaches that have a reliable running game. They breathe a little easier on the sideline. >> Yeah, they love the idea that they can take the air out of the football at this point of the game. That means they're really counting on that offensive line, counting on the runners, taking care of the football. Because you're going to tell your quarterback, "Hey, no time to be a hero. We're not going to throw it here." Just eat up that clock. And if you have the ball, they can't score. >> Give him three on first down. It'll set up a second and seven. >> Well, partner Marvin, our number one stats guy, just handed me a little card that says he has 97 yardds on the ground today. You think he's going to get the ball again? >> I think so. Three away from that century mark. Got to have it. >> Yeah. And I think what they're going to call is one of his favorite runs. Whatever he feels comfortable with and what the offensive line has executed well today to try and get him over 100 yardds. >> A lot of times it's that first read that you have. Maybe you get it in pre- snap and he locked in on his target, but he was covered quite well and that one's incomplete. >> They head to the line facing a third and seven following the incompletion on second down. Now Mayfield >> and he's going to go down. The Texans come at him and able to bring him to the ground. >> Will Anderson >> picks up his second sack of the afternoon. >> And that was just absolute perfect man coverage. Nowhere for them to go with the football. Led to a sack. And that's really difficult to do in today's NFL with all these gazels running around that you're trying to cover in the secondary. Here's Riley Dixon now >> as he'll putt it away for the fourth time today. [Applause] >> And here comes Barios. It'll be a 40 yd punt. Eight on the return. And out will come the offense as they take over >> working to put a drive together. [Applause] He'll hand it off here. This is Mixon and a short pick up to about the 25. >> Sometimes you're aligned perfectly and the play comes to you and sometimes you got to cover some ground to go make the play as we just saw there. >> We saw a great great example of perseverance right there on that play. >> Got to be careful. They might want to throw one over his head as this game progresses. Strad sets up the play action >> and this one is going to be off the mark. Too far out in front. >> Throws like that, especially where we sit in the fourth quarter. He's got to be careful. >> Yeah. And you know, one of my faults is that I often view this game through a defensive back's eyes. And in this situation, your team's losing. It's late. Tighter coverage. Take a chance and go and try and step in front of one of those and make a big play. So if you're the quarterback, that should be in your head. This is their time to take a gamble. >> And he's taken down, but able to slip across the 35. A pick up of 11 and a Texans first down. >> That's good for an Htown. First and 10 at the 37 yd line. [Applause] >> And that's a much needed first down right there. Look, they're down by eight. So Logic says they don't have to get a touchdown out of this drive, but the way things are going, I don't know if I'd put it in the hands of my defense here, you might not get the ball back at all. So if a fourth down situation comes up, I'm thinking hard about going for it right here and right now. >> And he's going to be stopped up quickly here. Just a yard up to the 39. >> He's definitely tough to get down. We just saw it right there. But how about what we did see pursuit wrap up and then the big finish with the tackle >> here now. Second and nine from the 39 yd line. >> Straoud off the play fake. This goes out wide for Nixon. >> So many times you hear today's NFL described as a space game. Get your best players into space with the football in their hands. That's why sometimes you just swing it out to your runner, get him out in the flat and let him have a chance to make people miss an open field. >> Now a third and six. >> Straoud looking to throw. Working the middle of the field and he's got a man complete and this is going to lead to another first down as the tackles made at the Bucks 45 yd line. >> Texans first down. We always hear about the connections some quarterbacks have with certain receivers. >> I think this guy has a connection with just about everyone. Didn't mind throwing it in there against double coverage to him. >> Show some confidence. Supreme confident. >> Big time confidence that he would make the play for him and he did. >> And a good push up front and he's able to navigate his way down inside the 30. >> A good gain again. That's now 31 yds combined on those last two plays. Another carry for their leader and a good one. It's crunch time. They'll need him to continue to be productive in both the run and passing game in order for them to try and snatch a victory. >> Back to the ground. This time it's Chub. Just a yard on the first down carry. So, it's second and nine. >> Well, sometimes you just have to give credit to the defense. Great job there at the point of attack holding up. They won their battles at the line of scrimmage. left him no space to try and run. Really nice job swarming to the ball carrier. >> Ball on the 27. Here's a second down and nine. Straoud out of the gun here. >> This is caught. It's Kirk and he'll take this one in for a Texans touchdown. Touchdown >> Christian Kirk 27 yds and the Texans have a chance to tie things up as they trail by two here in the fourth. So part one of what they needed is done. They get in the end zone. Now you have to imagine we'll see a try for two. >> And that's what the book says, but defensively they can't hang their head right here. They still got a chance to come out with the lead if they make a play. All right. Now, a big two-point conversion attempt still to come. [Applause] >> Stra's going to try to throw for the conversion. >> And he's got it. The conversion good. And we are tied in the fours. Heat. [Applause] Heat. [Applause] Still time to work with on the clock, but they wanted the tie now and they got it. >> And I love their aggressiveness. Go ahead and get it done. Get the game tied. Now your team has the momentum and you're staring across the field saying, "Let's see if you can match us." Now this one setting up for a great finish. All tied in the fourth as the kicks away and he brings us out past the 20 to the 24 >> and Tampa Bay trots out there now. >> They no longer have the lead after that last touchdown. All tied up in the fourth quarter and a chance for this offense to mount a potential game-winning drive right here. >> Throwing Mayfield now. They set up the screen that's complete. >> They'll be dropped after a gain of about six across the 30 to the 31. >> And a really nice play call there to start the drive, especially if you're a team that has a little bit of a reputation for throwing it downfield. You come out and you think maybe you can catch them off guard a little bit and they did. Little screen pass back door him and that time worked well for a solid game. >> From the gun, Mayfield. Evans has it left side. And they get him down, but not before he takes it across the 40 yd line. >> He's up to 88 yds receiving in the ball game now. And he's got a first down. >> Mayfield looks to throw. That's complete to his receiver, Gadwood. He's still on his feet. Touchdown Tampa Bay. >> Chris Godwin with his second touchdown of the afternoon. And the Buccaneers answer back with a touchdown of their own to break our tie and take the lead here in the fourth. But that's a heck of a response to regain the lead after we had seen the touchdown to tie the game. I would say what we just saw there was a great amount of poise because typically when teams tie the game up, it's a little bit of a how would you say? You kind of kind of take a step back and have to get yourself regrouped. They regrouped in a hurry, didn't they? They attacked back after they had been tied >> and in a big way. That was a statement long touchdown. Extra point by Mclofflin is up and good >> and they will take a seven-point lead. [Applause] [Applause] >> Following the touchdown, here's Mclofflin to kick off. and they will wrangle him down a couple yards shy of the 30. >> Joe Mixon and the rest of his offense making their way back onto the field. He has a chance to hit that often elusive 200 yd mark on this drive. >> And most of the time during a game, people aren't keeping track of individual statistics. >> Are you sure? Well, a lot of the runners kind of know, but I'll guarantee if someone has sent word into the offensive line that he's got a chance to get over 200 on this drive, that should give them a little extra motivation cuz they love it when backs break that barrier. >> Absolutely. Let's see if he can do it. [Applause] >> From the 35. Back to work on second and four [Applause] >> now. Joe Mixon and nothing doing. He's immediately taken down at the line of scrimmage. >> It'll be a loss of a yard and that's going to lead to a third and four coming up. >> Well, Brandon, he's had a great day, but sometimes the other guys make a play against you. What's that expression they like to use in the NFL? Those guys get paid too, you know. >> Yeah. In college, they say, "Hey, they're on scholarship, too." In the NFL, they're getting paid to. With the day he's had, you can have one go the wrong direction >> from the gun on third down. Here's Straoud. Ah, he had a man open, but he missed him and it's incomplete. >> Well, that plays a statistic that's going to go on the defensive team stat sheet. Won't necessarily reflect in hours, right? The overall game sheet, but you and I know that they keep count on pressures, hits on quarterbacks, all those things. Hoping to increase that throughout the game. And here we are in the fourth quarter and they got a big one. >> Yeah, such a close game. A very big one. and he'll get credit for putting him inside the 20 as the fair catch is made right at about the 19 yd line. >> The Bucks offense and veteran receiver Mike Evans headed back onto the field and he's had some kind of game. They made it a point to get him involved early and it has paid giant rewards to this stage of the game. He completes it to Evans and he's going to get this one across the 30 yd line. It's a gain of 13 for number 13 and it gives him a first down. >> Well, that should be a reminder defensively and I think it's a reminder to myself because you just can't sell out to stop the run. There's still enough time that this offense can move the football through the air even on first and second downs and they obviously picked the right spot to throw the ball there. And they've got it well across midfield down to the 40 before it's all said and done. Now we're going to get a timeout. Appears we've got an injured Buccaneer. >> The medical staff is going to come out here and take a look and we will take a short break. [Applause] Do it again down. [Applause] So a first and 10 now in Houston territory right at the 40. >> Straight ahead it's Irving. Try to find a lane but instead he'll get back to the line of scrimmage and no more. >> Brought down on the play by the linebacker Christian Harris. They've called his number a lot this afternoon. You wonder how much tread is left on those tires. >> We certainly do. But I always think back to one of my favorite coaches in the NFL and he used to have a meeting with his running backs every year in the off season and say, "Look, as many times as you're going to carry the ball, you should be able to carry it one more time. So, make sure you get in shape." >> And he works it past the 30 almost to the 25. >> These two have hooked up nine times now this afternoon as they pick up the first. This is something you got to be wary of defensively. I mean, just because they're in the mode of trying to burn some clock doesn't mean they won't pass in. They got good yardage out of that one. >> Yeah. And really, when you're looking at it now, they've got a fresh set of downs. Look for second down. If they want to take another shot and try and loosen things up, that'd be the time to do it. >> And he is out of bounds. But first, he gets it inside the 10 to the seven. >> Another big gainer that time. This one goes for 19 yds. And these guys certainly are not hiding what their intention is. They're absolutely showing it. They're definitely not going to sit on this lead here in the fourth quarter >> on the handoff. This is Irving >> and that'll move him a little closer as he takes it from the seven down to the four yd line. >> Able to stay in bounce. So the clock keeps rolling. This defense right now backed up in the red zone. Another touchdown. It's over. They've got to stand tall quickly. been in this spot before. Now there's a little bit of desperation creeping in. And all you're doing when you're talking to your defensive teammates is first guy there, hold him up, second, third guy in, rake it the football. Get it out. We get >> touchdown. >> Sterling Shepard >> from three yds out >> and the Buccaneers have opened up a two touchdown lead here in this fourth quarter. >> But that's certainly an important touchdown there. It makes this a two-score game. But as we've seen, no lead is safe in this one. With the way these two offenses have lit up the scoreboard, I would imagine that on their sidelines, they're both yelling at their defenses. Hey, you want to get involved here? One big play from you that can win the game for us. [Applause] Mclofflin now to add the PAT [Applause] >> and the lead is up to 14. >> So that drives seven plays in length >> and it's all finished off with a touchdown by Tampa Bay. Chase >> McLolin. >> Following the touchdown, here's Mclofflin to kick off. and makes it across the 20 as his guys will set up shop at the 23 yd line. >> Now comes a Houston offense as they get set to take over here. >> See if they can put this drive in the end zone, Charles, because it it's been a little bit of a rough go at times. They've had to punt the football a ton in this ball game because of stalled out drives. So, are you saying that you're kind of tired of seeing the punter run out there and do his thing during this game? Is that what you're trying to say? >> Well, I mean, I'm okay with it. I have a feeling that this offense, they don't want to see the punter again. >> And frankly, the punter doesn't want to run out there anymore himself. He would love to see his offense put together a drive and give his leg a rest. >> All three timeouts plus the two-minute warning. Here's first and 10. And they're well past midfield, just a yard or two shy of the 40. >> This where the NFL is headed year by year, partner. A league where just about everyone has someone under center who can get you with their legs as well as their arm. And we certainly had a nice display of that from both QBs in this game. And that continued with that first down run. >> Two minutes left to play in this football game here on EA Sports. They'll come up first and 10 here. as Straoud now to throw >> over the middle. He gets it to Collins >> and they're able to get this one past the 30 down to the 25 >> defensively here. You've got the cushion, but back to back. Pretty big pass plays there. >> Bend but don't break. But are they bending too much? >> I think that they are. To me, it'd be like playing basketball and you put up a token press. Make sure you get up there and make them eat up some time. make it a little bit of resistance so they can't just run it right down your throat. >> And he's brought down, but he has it down to the 12 on a pick up of 12. First and 10. >> Now a timeout called for by the offense >> as he'll get a chance to talk it over after picking up the first down. Straoud to throw it >> and he's in. Touchdown Houston. >> Brevin Jordan. A 12 yd touchdown grab and the Texans have made it a one-score game again here in the fourth. Okay, game on. Don't go anywhere yet. You got a one-sore game now. Probably going to rely on the onside kick coming up. >> Yeah, they have to. It's not a high percentage play, but it's better than not having a chance at all. And that's when you put your leapers and your flyers on one side, get that high hop and hope that one of the guys can come up with it. >> And on the other side, get that hands team ready. >> No doubt about it. >> Extra point by Fair up and good. >> And now things get a bit more interesting here in this fourth quarter. Texans 38. [Applause] >> A little less than 90 seconds to go. This will be an onside kick. >> Oh, and the Texans may have recovered. They did recover. This is first and 10. [Applause] Here's Straoud. And now he'll step up and run it. >> You know what I like about that play? He didn't try to do too much on first down. He took what the defense gave him, put together a solid game to bring up second and manageable. Now they have a couple of plays to pick up just a few yards and a new set of downs. >> Here comes second down. Now Strad and he finds his target. It's Schultz. Now the Texans will use one of their two remaining timeouts >> as they get it with under a minute to go now in the football game. >> And with that last play, he's now up over that 300 yd mark. >> And in today's NFL, it almost feels routine. And I hate that when you talk about a 300yd passing game. To me, 300 yd still signifies excellence. And he's achieved that in this performance. [Applause] Straoud >> and completes it to Kirk over the middle and inside the 20 before he's brought down. >> Brandon's okay what they're doing right now. Still able to work the middle of the field, but you know, sooner or later they're going to have to stop the clock. >> First and 10 at the 16 yd line. [Applause] >> Final minute, one timeout remaining. First and 10. Straoud back to throw. Schulz hauls in the quick throw. >> The Texans going to signal for their third and final timeout >> as they get it with 26 seconds to go in the football game. >> It's all pretty simple sometimes, isn't it? Go where the defenders are not. And he does exactly that. Makes a nice catch to move the chains. Defense got to find a better way of accounting for the shorter routes that are being run against them. >> Now first and goal. to throw with Straoud. >> Eluding the pressure right and yes, he's into the end zone. So they get the late score they needed and now the extra point can tie this thing up in the final minute. >> If you're going to play quarterback in the NFL, you've got to have great vision and you've got to remain calm when things break down in the pocket. Both of those traits were on display there. He surveys the situation, sees the middle of the field open, so he's just going to step up and take it himself. Very well done there. And now the decision is to go for two. A gutsy call and this in effect is your ball game right here. >> Here's Stra >> and it is caught. They got the two points and with it they've taken the lead. Buccaneers 45. [Applause] And boy, you want to talk about Guts. Guts is going for two when you're down one in that spot right there. >> Do they not trust their kicker? Did they not feel that it was time to go ahead and do that? or did they just say we've got a play on that we're so confident in we're going to go ahead and do it. I'm going to say they're going to say that in the press conference >> and not much happening on the return as he'll get this to about the 23 >> and we shift to spotlighting Mike Evans and I know that they've double teamed him a couple times but not a ton. Whatever they're doing isn't working. He's up over 100 yards. We'll see how they adjust. >> And when they do that they weaken their defense in other places as well. Oh, and how many times have we done games where we've seen a guy have a big game like this, but it's usually not by himself, is it? Usually, it opens it up for other people to have big games as well. >> Now, the Bucks going to use the first of their timeout >> as they stop it with 14 seconds to go in the game. [Music] >> Two timeouts still in their back pocket. It's first and 10. Here's Baker >> looking middle and he's got a bua. >> But Bucks's going to go ahead and use the second of their timeouts. >> And as the two teams talk it over on their respective sidelines, we take a break >> at the 35 yd line. [Applause] Now second down and a few inches. >> Now a give. Irving running right and he works it to the 30 yd line here right at the 30 >> and whistles and they take their final timeout with 7 seconds left. >> Now we all know that an offensive coordinator and a quarterback they're aligned at the hip but when you've got a runner who can get you that kind of yardage that guy's invaluable. And now this game's going to come down to the right leg of their kicker. >> He did have one blocked earlier. This time it's for the win. And his kick is absolutely perfect. >> And it's celebration time on that sideline as they have taken the lead in the final seconds. So, a good kick that time and that might help to get the negative thoughts out of the mind from that earlier block, >> especially since this was not a chippy. So, he had to get that one out kind of low, but his line does a nice job of protecting. He's able to convert for three. >> This take it in at the goal line. [Applause] >> Well, this one partner was fun down at the very end. They got the points late right before the whistle. Then the ensuing kickoff. They were hoping for magic on the other side, but couldn't get that spark. >> Fun if you won and fun for us because we got to watch it and call it. That magic that you were talking about didn't occur at the end, but what a game all the way through. >> So, that'll do it for us for Charles Davis and all our crew. I'm Brandon Gordon. You've been watching the NFL on EA Sports. >> So long from Houston. What would that problem stay in the office? [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
