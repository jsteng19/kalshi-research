THE
FOOTBALL.
GLAD TO HAVE YOU WITH US ON ABC
AND ESPN.
JOHN HARBAUGH ON THE RIGHT.
SEASON NUMBER 18.
WITH THE BALTIMORE RAVENS AND
DAN CAMPBELL, SEASON NUMBER
FIVE.
TWO GUYS THAT GUIDED THEIR TEAMS
INTO THE POSTSEASON.
TWO DIVISION WINNERS A YEAR AGO,
LAMAR JACKSON GETTING SET TO
ROLL.
HE'LL WATCH HIS DEFENSE START
THE NIGHT.
LITTLE POP-UP KICK AND JACOB
SAYLORS, FORMER UFL PLAYER WITH
THE ST. LOUIS BATTLEHAWKS SPINS
HIS WAY OUT ACROSS THE 30, AND
THAT'S IT.
FORWARD PROGRESS IS STOPPED.
IT'S A RETURN OF 22 YARD, AND
HERE COMES JARED GOFF.
LAST WEEK AGAINST THE BEARS
COMPLETED PASSES AT 82%.
YOU SEE THE YARDAGE.
ONLY 5 INCOMPLETIONS TO GO WITH
HIS FIVE TOUCHDOWN PASSES.
Troy: WHAT WE HAD COME TO
EXPECT WHEN YOU WATCH JARED GOFF
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WITH BEN
JOHNSON CALLING PLAYS AND AS WE
TALKED ABOUT COMING INTO 9 GAME,
WEEK ONE DIDN'T GO AS HE WOULD
LIKE NOUR THE LIONS.
LAST WEEK THEY GOT BACK ON
TRACK.
ANOTHER BIG TEST ON THE ROAD
TONIGHT.
Joe: HERE'S GIBBS.
NOT MUCH.
THE ROOKIE MALAKI STARKS CAME
DOWN TO MAKE THE STOP, AND HE
WAS NOT ALONE.
WE'LL LOOK AT THE SKILL POSITION
PLAYERS FOR THE DETROIT LIONS,
AND THEY'RE AS GOOD AS ANY GROUP
HAS AROUND THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL
LEAGUE AND, TROY, THEIR
OFFENSIVE LINE LOOKS DIFFERENCE
THAN IT DID A YEAR AGO.
Troy: IT REALLY DOES.
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE STRENGTH
WITH DAN CAMPBELL AS THE HEAD
COACH, BUT WHEN FRANK RETIRED
AND THEN KEVIN ZEITLER, HE WENT
TO TENNESSEE AND AFFECTED THREE
POSITIONS.
Joe: GOFF HAS A WIDE-OPEN
JAMESON WILLIAMS AND A SPINNING
CATCH, OUT OF BOUNDS NEAR THE
40.
HE IS THEIR DOWNFIELD BIG CHUNK
YARDAGE RECEIVER, AND THAT ONE
GOOD FOR 24.
Troy: SUCH A GOOD JOB OF HIM
AS HE COMES OFF THE BALL,
BECAUSE OF THE SPEED THAT YOU
TALK ABOUT, JOE, HE GETS THE
SECONDARY TURNING AND RUNNING.
YOU SEE THE SAFETY, HOW HE JUST
CLEARS OUT BECAUSE OF THE DEEP
BALL THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED
ABOUT.
THEY SHOWED THAT LAST WEEK.
BIG TOUCHDOWN RECEPTION BY
JAMESON WILLIAMS IN THAT WIN
LAST WEEK AGAINST CHICAGO.
Joe: HANDOFF TO GIBBSS AND
RIGHT THERE IS OWEH, ODAFE OWEH
MAKES THE STOP WITH A LOSS OF
THREE.
Troy: THEY COME IN HERE AND
HAVE TWO TIGHT ENDS BUT THAT'S
BROCK WRIGHT, AND OWEH BEATS HIM
OFF THE BALL INSIDE AND JUST NO
OPPORTUNITY.
TO GET ANYTHING GOING.
Joe: STRUGGLED TO RUN THE
BALL WEEK ONE AT GREEN BAY.
THEY WERE OUTSTANDING RUNNING IT
AGAINST CHICAGO.
HERE'S GIBBS AGAIN.
ABLE TO PICK HIS WAY AND MAKE
THIRD DOWN A LITTLE MORE
MANAGEABLE.
A GAIN OF SEVEN.
WE CAN LOOK AT THIS DEFENSE FOR
BALTIMORE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT
WAY, MAYBE THE EASIEST WAY IS TO
TELL YOU WHO IS NOT THERE.
AND THAT'S JAIRE ALEXANDER,
SECOND STRAIGHT WEEK HE'S ON THE
SHELF STILL REHABBING THE KNEE,
NNAMDI MADUBUIKE WHO IS RIGHT
THERE ON YOUR SCREEN, A BIG
PRESENCE UP FRONT, AND THEIR
SACK LEADER FROM A YEAR AGO,
KYLE VAN NOY.
THIRD DOWN AND SIX.
GOFF PROTECTED.
FIRES, AND ANOTHER CATCH FOR
WILLIAMS.
HE'S GOT ONE FOR 24.
THIS ONE FOR 19.
AND JAMESON WILLIAMS, WHO
THEY'VE REWARDED WITH A NEW
CONTRACT, TWO BIG PLAYS.
Troy: YEAH, AND THE REASON
IS, HE HAS SO MUCH SPEED COMING
OFF THE BALL, THE RAVENS ARE
TRYING TO PLAY COVERAGE AND
THEY'RE TRYING TO RUN THIS
UMAROV
UMBRELLA UP OVER THE TOP.
SEE HOW THE SAFETIES GET OUT OF
THERE.
THEY'RE WORRIED HE WILL GO DEEP
AND ALL OF THAT UNDERNEATH
COVERAGE THEN PENS UP FOR HIM
TO MAKE THE EASY COMPLETION.
Joe: HERE'S GIBBS.
MONTGOMERY WAS OUT THERE
BLOCKING.
HE WENT TO THE RIGHT.
GIBBS WENT TO THE LEFT, AND
PICKS UP TWO.
WE HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN A CHECK ON
AMON-RA ST. BROWN, WHO IS THEIR
TOP THREAT ON THE OUTSIDE.
HE THEIR LEADING RECEIVER WITH
13 CATCHES ALREADY THIS SEASON.
YOU CAN PENCIL HIM IN FOR 100
PLUS CATCHES A YEAR.
HE DOES EVERYTHING.
HE'S KIND OF THE ANTI-DIVA.
HE BLOCKS.
HE'S A GREAT TEAMMATE.
JARED GOFF WOULD TAKE HIM OVER
EVERYBODY IF YOU PUT THEM ALL IN
A BIG DRAFT, HE'D TAKE 14.
Troy: PRETTY IMPRESSIVE WHEN
HE SAID HE'S THE BEST RECEIVER
HE'S EVER THROWN TO.
Joe: SECOND DOWN AND EIGHT.
GIBBS.
TRIED TO STAY IN BOUNDS, HIS
MOMENTUM CARRIED HIM OUT.
A GAIN OF FIVE, SO THIRD AND
SHORT COMING UP AND YOU KNOW THE
DEAL WITH DAN CAMPBELL.
ANY TIME HE GOT THIRD DOWN, YOU
THINK ABOUT FOURTH DOWN AND DAN
CAMPBELL, BODY GOES FOR FOURTH
DOWNS MORE THAN THAT HEAD COACH.
Troy: THIRD AND FIVE, IF IT'S
BEYOND THE 50 YARD LINE, HE'S
GOING FOR IT ON FOURTH DOWN OVER
50% OF THE TIME, SO YOU LOOK AT
IT RIGHT NOW, AND JOHNNIE
MORTON, THE OFFENSIVE
COORDINATOR SAID DAN CAMPBELL
WOULD HAVE TOLD HIM ALREADY IF
DOESN'T TO AFFECT WHAT HE MIGHT
NOW CALL ON THIRD.
Joe: CAME UNDERNEATH TO
GIBBS.
INCOMPLETE.
AND WHAT DOES CAMPBELL DO?
HE COACHES THE OFFENSE OUT
THERE.
THEY ALREADY KNEW IT.
GOFF WAS AWARE OF IT.
FOURTH AND THREE AND THEY'LL GO
FOR IT.
Troy: THE RIGHT IDEA.
I LIKE WHAT JARED GOFF WAS
TRYING TO DO, JUST REALLY A
MISCOMMUNICATION WITH HIM AND
JAHMYR GIBBS ON WHAT GIBBS WAS
DOING EXACTLY, BUT THERE'S THE
FIRST BIG DECISION FOR DAN
CAMPBELL.
I ALWAYS LIKE COMING AWAY WITH
POINTS ON THE OPENING DRIVE ON
THE ROAD AGAINST A GOOD
OPPONENT.
WE'LL SEE IF THIS PAYS OFF FOR
THEM.
Joe: A LOT OF MOVEMENT.
PLAY CLOCK AT 3.
GOFF, THERE'S ST. BROWN, FIRST
CATCH, A BIG ONE, FIRST IN GOAL
WORKING AGAINST KYLE HAMILTON
WHO MADE THE STOP.
JAHMYR GIBBS DELIVERED A GREAT
BLOCK AND A GAIN OF SEVEN AND A
FRESH SET.
Troy: IT'S GOOD ON GOOD.
DOESN'T GET BETTER THAN THIS.
AMON-RA ST. BROWN AND KYLE
HAMILTON AND EXCELLENT ROUTE,
JOE.
YOU TALKED ABOUT IT A MOMENT
AGO, ALL THE THINGS HE CAN DO.
HE DOESN'T TELEGRAPH IT.
HE COMES OFF THE LINE OF
SCRIMMAGE.
HAMILTON KNOWS THE DOWN AND
DISTANCE, HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S
GOING TO TRY TO DO, THE DEPTH,
BUT HE STILL COULDN'T JUMP IT
BECAUSE HE WAS SO DISCIPLINED IN
HOW HE RAN THE ROUTE.
Joe: HERE'S GIBBS.
FIGHTING.
AND HE'S GOING TO BE BROUGHT
DOWN AT THE 1.
SECOND DOWN AND GOAL AFTER GIBBS
GOT THREE.
AND THE LIONS WANT TO GO RIGHT
BACK TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
Troy: THEY WANT TO GET RIGHT
BACK ON THE LINE AND SEE IF THEY
CAN'T CATCH BALTIMORE JUST OFF A
LITTLE BIT, UNABLE TO GET A CALL
INTO THE DEFENSE.
Joe: GIBBS, TOUCHDOWN!
WHAT A GOOD START FOR THE LIONS.
THE CONVERSION ON FOURTH DOWN,
LAMAR JACKSON WILL TRY TO ANSWER
AND THE LIONS, WHO PUT UP 52 ON
THE BEARS, HAVE ONE POSSESSION
AND INTO THE END ZONE THEY GO.
Troy: A LOT OF AMON-RA ST.
BROWN HERE AS THE LEAD BLOCKER.
AN EXCELLENT JOB OF SEALING IT
AND KALIF RAYMOND GETTING UP
THERE AS WELL.
IF YOU PLAY WIDE RECEIVER, NOT
ONLY DO YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO
CATCH THE FOOTBALL THIS THIS
OFFENSE, YOU BETTER BE ABLE TO
BLOCK AND A WILLING BLOCKER AND
ALL OF THESE LIONS RECEIVERS ARE
CAPABLE OF THAT.
Joe: EXTRA POINT FROM JAKE
BATES.
LOW SNAP.
KICK IS GOOD.
JARED GOFF TELLING US ABOUT ST.
BROWN.
THERE IS NO 100-CATCH RECEIVER
WHO BLOCKS LIKE ST. BROWN.
HE SEALED IT OFF.
GIBBS TAKES IT IN.
ON THE JOE
TESS AND STEVE LEVY.
GLAD YOU'RE WITH US TONIGHT.
WE'LL GIVE YOU THE NUMBERS AND
GET INTO THOSE NUMBERS JUST A
LITTLE BIT.
MORE WHEN LAMAR TAKES THE FIELD
HERE IN A SECOND AS THE LIONS
WENT DOWN AND SCORED, AND NOW
BATES KICKS IT AWAY.
IT LANDED IN THE LANDING ZONE
AND GOES INTO THE END ZONE.
IT COMES OUT TO THE 20 IS WHAT
PYHHAGORAST SAYS.
Troy: WE'VE CALLED SOME OF
THOSE GAMES AND PRETTY
IMPRESSIVE, WHAT HE DOES UNDER
THE LIGHTS.
HE JUST CONTINUES TO GET BETTER
AND BETTER AND PLAYING WITH AS
MUCH CONFIDENCE NOW AS I'VE
SEEN.
ESPECIALLY WITH HIS ABILITY IN
THE POCKET.
Joe: THEY FAKE IT TO DERRICK
HENRY AND WIDE OPEN IS ANDREWS.
THEY WANT TO GET HIM MORE
INVOLVED TONIGHT AND, MARK, WHO
HAD TWO CATCHES TOTAL OVER THE
FIRST TWO GAMES IS GOOD FOR 19
YARDS.
Troy: NOT A LOT OF
OPPORTUNITIES THE FIRST COUPLE
OF WEEKS BUT IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF TIME AND HERE THEY OPEN UP
THE THIRD WEEK WITH A PASS TO
OLD RELIABLE, NUMBER 89.
YOU KNOW IT WAS A TOUGH
OFF-SEASON FOR HIM THE WAY IT
ENDED WITH THAT PLAYOFF LOSS TO
BUFFALO, BUT HE'S ONE OF THE
ALL-TIME GREAT TIGHT ENDS, NO
DOUBT.
Joe: HE FUMBLED IN THAT
BUFFALO GAME.
HE DROPPED A POTENTIAL TWO-POINT
CONVERSION IN THE END ZONE.
HUTCHINSON WILL COST THE LIONS
FIVE.
Referee: NEUTRAL ZONE
INFRACTION.
FIVE-YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN.
Joe: JUST TO FINISH ON MARK
ANDREWS, AFTER THAT GAME HE
DIDN'T SPEAK WITH THE MEDIA BUT
HE WENT TO INSTAGRAM AND HE SAID
AMONG OTHER THINGS HE'S
ABSOLUTELY GUTTED BY WHAT
HAPPENED, AND THEN COMING INTO
THIS YEAR, I'M A PRO.
THAT'S WHAT I DO.
HE'S BACK, AND TALKING TO JOHN
HARBAUGH, HE SAID, IF YOU WANT
TO KNOW HIS MINDSET, WATCH HIM
BLOCK.
Troy: I THOUGHT THAT WAS
INTERESTING SAYING IF HIS MIND
WASN'T IN IT, YOU WOULDN'T SEE
HIM BLOCKING AS WELL AS HE IS,
SAYS HE'S BLOCKING AS GOOD OVER
THE FIRST COUPLE OF WEEKS AS HE
HAS AT ANY TIME OF HIS CAREER.
Joe: I-FORMATION, HENRY WILL
TAKE THE BALL WITH A LEAD BACK
IN FRONT OF HIM AND JUST PLOW
FOR A FIRST DOWN.
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS OFFENSE FOR
BALTIMORE AS THEY'RE TRYING TO
ANSWER THE OPENING SALVO FROM
THE LIONS.
ZAY FLOWERS IS THEIR NUMBER ONE
RECEIVER.
WE JUST SAW DERRICK HENRY AND
SAW MARK ANDREWS ALREADY.
D. HOP IS STILL DOING IT AT 33
YEARS OLD, DeANDRE HOPKINS, AND
THE OFFENSIVE LINE, THAT CENTER
IS OUTSTANDING, TYLER
LINDERBAUM, TWO-TIME PRO BOWLER.
Troy: ONE OF THE BEST CENTERS
IN FOOTBALL AND ERIC DeCOSTA HAS
DONE A GREAT JOB PUTTING A LOT
OF GREAT PLAYERS AROUND LAMAR
JACKSON IN RECENT YEARS.
Joe: LAMAR KEEPS AND CUTS,
AND SLIPS.
BUT HAS ANOTHER FIRST DOWN FOR
THE RAVENS AS HE'S ABLE TO GET
12.
Troy: YOU THINK YOU GOT HIM,
BUT YOU DON'T GOT HIM BECAUSE
IT'S LAMAR JACKSON AND DERRICK
BARNES WHO PUTS HIMSELF IN A
PERFECT POSITION TO BE ABLE TO
COME UP AND MAKE A PLAY, HE'S
RIGHT THERE, BUT THEN LAMAR IS
ABLE TO JUST CUT ON A DIME AND
GET IT GOING UP THE FIELD AND
HE'S NOT THE FIRST GUY THAT
WE'VE SEEN LAMAR DO THAT TO.
HE WON'T BE THE LAST.
NOT EVEN TONIGHT.
Joe: NO QUARTERBACK IN NFL
HISTORY HAS RUSHED FOR MORE
YARDS IN THE CAREER THAN LAMAR
JACKSON, FIRST DOWN, RAVENS,
QUICK THROW, ANDREWS AGAIN.
KERBY JOSEPH, THE ALL PRO MADE
THE STOP, BUT ANOTHER CHUNK OF
YARDAGE AND A GAIN OF EIGHT.
Troy: WHAT'S INTERESTING
ABOUT THAT, JOE, THE YARDAGE
HE'S HAD RUNNING THE FOOTBALL
THE NUMBERS HAVE GONE DOWN OVER
THE COURSE OF HIS CAREER, WHICH
IS, YOU'D EXPECT THAT WHEN
YOU'RE YOUNG, YOU DON'T SEE THE
DEFENSE AS WELL.
AND THEN AS YOU MATURE, YOU
START TO RECOGNIZE, READ
COVERAGES, ALL OF THAT.
BUT FOR LAMAR, IT'S THOSE THINGS
AND THEN IN ADDITION JUST HE'S
BEEN SURGICAL IN THE POCKET WHEN
HE'S HAD TIME AND FINDING OPEN
RECEIVERS.
Joe: HENRY GETS IT THIS TIME,
AND THE LIONS STEP UP, A GAIN OF
JUST ONE.
DERRICK BARNES, WHO WAS INVOLVED
IN THAT RUN BY LAMAR JACKSON A
MOMENT AGO MADE THAT STOP.
IT'S THIRD DOWN AND ONE.
AIDAN HUTCHINSON UP FRONT IS
KIND OF THE LAST MAN STANDING.
THEY PUT MARCUS DAVENPORT ON
I.R. TODAY, THEIR LINEBACKER IS
REAL GOOD WITH ANZALONE AND
CAMPBELL AND BRIAN BRANCH IS
JUST ALL OVER THE PLACE FOR THE
LIONS.
Troy: THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD
PLAYERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE
BALL FOR BOTH THESE TEAMS AS WE
TAKE A LOOK AT KELVIN SHEPPARD.
Joe: EASY PICKUP, FORGET
FIRST DOWN.
HOW ABOUT TOUCHDOWN.
THERE IS A FLAG ON THE FAR SIDE
OF THE FIELD.
AND THIS WILL --
Referee: 95, LINED UP FROM
THE NEUTRAL ZONE.
PENALTY DECLINED.
RESULT OF THE PLAY, TOUCHDOWN.
Joe: I MEAN, DERRICK HENRY
JUST GLIDING TO THE END ZONE.
THEY NEEDED ONE FOR A FIRST
DOWN.
THEY GOT 28 FOR A TOUCHDOWN.
Troy: ROGER ROSENGARTEN HE
COMES OFF THE BALL.
HE DOES AN OUTSTANDING JOB
SEALING IT AND THEN THERE'S MARK
ANDREWS.
WE TALKED ABOUT HIS BLOCKING AS
HE GETS UP TO THE SECOND LEVEL.
ROSENGARTEN CLEARS THINGS OUT
AND MARK ANDREWS IS THERE TO
SEAL TO ALLOW HENRY ON THE EDGE.
IT'S AN OUTSTANDING JOB OF
EXECUTION.
Joe: THE ROOKIE, TYLER LOOP,
TIES THE GAME.
LAST WEEK AGAINST CLEVELAND HERE
AT HOME DERRICK HENRY, 11
CARRIES, 23 YARDS.
HE'S ALREADY GOT 36 TONIGHT.
INCLUDING THAT 28-YARD GLIDE TO
TIE IT AT 7.THAT YOU'LL
SEE FROM M&amp;T BANK STADIUM HERE
IN BALTIMORE.
AS LOOP KICKS IT AWAY.
SAYLORS AGAIN.
FULL HEAD OF STEAM, AND KNOCKED
DOWN AS HE CROSSED THE 30.
WE'LL GO DOWN TO LISA.
Lisa: YEAH, JOE, DERRICK
HENRY SAID WHAT HAD BEEN ON HIS
MIND ALL WEEK LONG THE FACT THAT
HE FUMBLED IN EACH OF THE FIRST
TWO GAMES OF THE SEASON AND HAD
THE 23 RUSHING YARDS AGAINST THE
BROWNS.
FOR HIM HE SAID IF HE HADN'T
BEEN PLAYING UP TO STANDARDS AND
DIDN'T CARE IF THE BROWNS WERE
BASICALLY STACKING THE BOX AND
SELLING OUT TO STOP THE RUN, HE
SAID IT'S HIGGS JOB TO MAKE
SOMETHING HAPPEN NO MATTER WHAT.
LAST WEEK WAS HIS FAULT, HE'D
BEEN REPLAYING IT ALL WEEK IN
HIS MIND AND COULD NOT WAIT TO
GET OUT HERE TONIGHT AND BREAK
LOOSE.
Joe: YEAH, LISA, AS IF A MAN
THAT SIZE, 6'3", 232 NEEDS ANY
MORE INSPIRATION TO GO AFTER A
TEAM, HE IS INSPIRED TONIGHT,
THAT WAS AN INCOMPLETE PASS.
THE PRESSURE BY MARLON HUMPHREY
WHO CAME ON A BLITZ, SAYING THAT
WAS A LIVE BALL.
THAT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS FORWARD
PASS TO ME.
Troy: IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS
FORWARD PASS TO ME AS WELL.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THEY BROUGHT MARLON HUMPHREY IN,
AS YOU SEE, AMON-RA ST. BROWN,
HE COMES ACROSS.
HE'S GOING TO TRY TO PICK THAT
UP.
HERE'S A LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT
IT WAS LIVE.
YEAH, I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR
THAT THAT WAS --
Joe: WELL, THEY CALLED THAT
BACKWARD, AND THEY MOVED THE
BALL BACK, SO NOW IT'S SECOND
AND 19 INSTEAD OF SECOND AND
TEN.
I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT CALL.
HERE'S GIBBS OVER THE RIGHT
SIDE, AND HE WAS STOOD UP AT THE
LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND GOT TO THE
EDGE.
AS MIKE GREEN MADE THAT PLAY, NO
GAIN.
LET'S GO BACK TO THAT FIRST DOWN
PASS.
IT LOOKS LIKE THE BALL IS
RELEASED RIGHT AT ABOUT THE 23
YARD LINE AND THEN THE QUESTION
IS WHEN IT'S FIRST TOUCHED BY A
DETROIT TEAMMATE AND LOOKS LIKE
IT'S AT THE 23 YARD LINE, I
THINK IT'S FORWARD BUT TOO CLOSE
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE CHANGED IT IF
CHALLENGED.
Troy: THEY'RE NOT USUALLY
CALLING THEM THAT TIGHT ON A
BACKWARDS,
BACKWARD S PASS, ARE THEY.
NO.
Joe: NOW IT'S THIRD DOWN AND
19.
THE SILENT COUNT.
THEY SET UP A SCREEN FOR GIBBS
AND HE'S BROUGHT DOWN AT THE 30.
WELL SHORT OF A FIRST DOWN BY
TEDDYE BUCHANAN, A ROOKIE THEY
LOVE.
Troy: YEAH, REALLY HARD WHEN
YOU'RE GOING UP AGAINST ANY
DEFENSE BUT ESPECIALLY ONE AS
TALENTED AS THIS RAVENS GROUP.
WHEN YOU GET BEHIND THE STICKS,
YOU KNOW, AFTER THAT RULING ON
FIRST DOWN, THEN IT BECOMES A
FIELD POSITION GAME ON THIRD
DOWN TRYING TO GIVE AS MUCH
YARDS AS YOU CAN IF YOU CAN'T
BACK THEM UP A LITTLE BIT, BUT
WHAT WE'VE SEEN FROM THE RAVENS
ON BOTH POSSESSIONS, NOW,
GRANTED THE FIRST ONE THE LIONS
TOOK IT DOWN FOR A TOUCHDOWN.
THEY'RE PLAYING A LOT OF
COVERAGE AND THEY'RE INVITING
THE LIONS TO TRY TO RUN THE
FOOTBALL AGAINST SOME FAVORABLE
LOOKS.
THE LYONS HAVEN'T HAD SUCCESS
WHEN THEY TRIED IT.
Joe: JACK FOX TO PUNT.
HITS A BEAUTY.
LaJOHNTAY WESTER IS BACK, FEELS
-- FIELDS AND GETS HIT HARD.NS.
GET $100 IN BONUS BETS WHEN YOU
MAKE YOUR FIRST $10 BET.
Joe: SECOND POSSESSION FOR
THE RAVENS, AND THEY WILL START
THIS POSSESSION AT THEIR 27.
WE TALK A LOT ABOUT DERRICK
HENRY AND THE SIZE.
HIS SPEED IS INCREDIBLE, AND THE
POWER THAT HE GETS GOING IN SUCH
A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME, HE AND
JAHMYR GIBBS, THE LIONS' TOP
BACK, GET IT GOING FAST, AND
WE'LL SHOW YOU SOME OF THE
NUMBERS THAT WE CAN PUT TO HOW
THEY GET ROLLING WHEN THE BALL
IS SNAPPED.
I-FORMATION BEHIND JACKSON, WHO
KEEPS, AND OF DERRICK HENRY.
Troy: AND ONE IS 200 POUNDS
IN GIBBS AND ONE IS 250 POUNDS.
Joe: HE DIDN'T GET ROLLING
THIS TIME.
HE GOT STOPPED.
CAMPBELL IN ON THE STOP AND
HERE'S DERRICK HENRY ON THAT
CARRY FOR THE TOUCHDOWN ON A
THIRD AND ONE.
Troy: YOU GET A GUY THAT BIG
WITH THAT KIND OF SPEED, YOU
KNOW, YOU DON'T SEE HIM CAUGHT
VERY MANY TIMES FROM BEHIND, AND
IT'S A LETHAL COMBINATION AS
WE'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER
AND THE DURABILITY THAT HE HAS
SHOWN AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT'S
REMARKABLE, JOE, AS MUCH AS HE'S
BEEN THE BELL COW FOR SO MANY
YEARS IN THE LEAGUE HE HAS A
LITTLE OVER 50% OF THE CARRIES
THAT EMMITT SMITH HAD IN HIS
CAREER SO GIVES YOU AN IDEA HOW
DURABLE EMMITT SMITH WAS.
HE MISSED FOUR GAMES IN THE 13
YEARS WITH THE COWBOYS.
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.
Joe: THIRD AND THREE AND THIS
ONE FOR JUSTICE HILL IS
INCOMPLETE.
IF YOU CAUGHT IT BUT LAMAR'S
FRUSTRATED THAT HE MISSED HILL
ON THAT THROW.
IT'S FOURTH DOWN AND A PUNT
UPCOMING BUT DERRICK HENRY WAS
AT 11 1/2 MILES PER HOUR WHEN HE
HIT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE ON
THAT 28-YARD TOUCHDOWN.
Troy: LIKE I SAID, AT 250
POUNDS, THERE'S NOT A LINEBACKER
FOR THE LIONS THAT WEIGHS 250
POUNDS.
AND SO HE'S BIGGER THAN THOSE
GUYS THAT ARE MOSTLY TRYING TO
TACKLE HIM.
YOU GOT TO GET HIM AT THE LINE
OF SCRIMMAGE.
IT'S HAPPENED A FEW TIMES
TONIGHT, BUT THAT'S THE KEY.
Joe: HERE'S KALIF RAYMOND WHO
FIELDED THE PUNT INSIDE HIS 5.
THERE'S A FLAG DOWN ON THE PLAY.
AND RAYMOND JUST SHOULD HAVE LET
IT GO INTO THE END ZONE.
T.J. TAMPA MADE THE TACKLE.
IT WAS A 63-YARD PUNT, AND A
FLAG WAS THROWN EARLY.
Referee: DURING THE KICK,
HOLDING, RECEIVING TEAM, NUMBER
4.
HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL.
Joe: BACK HIM UP.
Troy: THAT WILL TAKE THE BALL
INSIDE THE 5.
SO JARED GOFF AND COMPANY BACK
TO WORK.
TEAMS WHO HAD TWO REAL TOUGH
LOSSES TO SWALLOW IN WEEKS TWO
AND THREE.
BOTH GAMES WILL BE AVAILABLE ON
THE ALL NEW ESPN APP.
Troy: SO EARLY IN THE SEASON,
THERE'S A LOT OF LEFT TO BE
PLAYED BUT A LOT OF ANGST.
FOR SOME OF THESE TEAMS THAT
HAVE A LITTLE URGENCY INTO WEEK
FOUR.
Joe: LIONS STARTING AT THEIR
1 1/2 AND THEY START WITH THEIR
BIGGER BACK OF THE TWO, THAT'S
DAVID MONTGOMERY WHO IS ABLE TO
PUSH THE PILE FORWARD AND HE
GETS FOUR, TAVIUS ROBINSON WAS
IN THERE WITH HELP ON THE STOP.
Troy: THAT'S A GOOD JOB.
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.
I KNOW COMING INTO THE GAME WE
TALKED ABOUT THE YOUNG GUARDS
THAT THE LIONS HAVE AND
CHRISTIAN MAHOGANY, LEFT GUARD
THEN TATE RATLEDGE, THE ROOKIE
AT RIGHT GUARD AND HOW THEY
HANDLED WEEK ONE, IT WAS A
STRUGGLE, AND LAST WEEK WAS GOOD
AT HOME, BUT HERE'S ANOTHER TEST
ON THE ROAD, RAVENS KNEW WHAT
THEY WERE GOING TO DO ON FIRST
DOWN.
THEY GOT PRETTY GOOD MOVEMENT.
Joe: FLAG ON THE PLAY, AS
MONTGOMERY IS WRAPPED UP IN THE
BACKFIELD.
THAT PLAY IS MADE BY JOHN
JENKINS.
HE'S BEEN DOING IT A LONG TIME,
13 YEARS.
HERE'S THE CALL FROM BILL
VINOVICH.
Referee: ILLEGAL FORMATION,
OFFENSE.
COVERED UP BY THE WIDE RECEIVER,
THE PENALTY IS DECLINED.
RESULT OF THE PLAY A THIRD DOWN.
Joe: TAKE THE RESULT OF THE
PLAY, A LOSS OF ONE AND THAT
BRINGS UP THIRD AND LONG.
Troy: YEAH, THEY WERE ABLE TO
DECLINE THE PLAY BECAUSE OF THE
JOB BY JOHN JENKINS RIGHT IN THE
MIDDLE.
GLASGOW, WHO IS THE STARTER AND
LEFT GUARD LAST YEAR MOVES TO
CENTER THIS YEAR, AND JENKINS
JUST TOSSES HIM ASIDE AND IS
ABLE TO MAKE THE PLAY FOR THE
ONE-YARD LOSS.
Joe: FRANK RAGNOW RETIRED IN
JUNE.
THIRD DOWN AND SEVEN.
GOFF PROTECTED AND HE FINDS HIS
TIGHT END LaPORTA.
A DRIVE THAT STARTED AT THE
1 1/2 AND SAM LaPORTA HAS HIS
TENTH CATCH OF THE SEASON, FIRST
OF THE NIGHT, GOOD FOR TEN.
Troy: YEAH, MALAKI STARKS,
ANOTHER ROOKIE, HE'S NUMBER 24
FOR THE RAVENS WHO'S ASSIGNED
LaPORTA IN MAN COVERAGE TO TRY
TO GUARD HIM.
LaPORTA COMES IN, MAYBE GETS A
LITTLE BIT OF A PUSH AT THE TOP
OF THAT ROUTE, CREATING SOME
SEPARATION BUT THERE WAS NO
QUESTION, ONCE GOFF SEES THE
COVERAGE, KNOWING THAT HE HAD
LaPORTA UP AGAINST THE ROOKIE
SAFETY.
Joe: THAT'S IT FOR QUARTER
NUMBER ONE HERE AT M&amp;T BANK
STADIUM.
7-7 GAME, FIRST DOWN FOR THE
LIONS WITH THE BALL OUTSIDE
THEIR 15 WHEN WE COME BACK.
HERE AT THE END OF WEEK THREE.
SAME
DAY COVERAGE.
CHECK YOUR PRICE TODAY AT
ETHOS COMM.
Joe: 7-7 BALL GAME AS WE
START THE SECOND QUARTER.
NICE FIRST DOWN PICKED UP BY
LaPORTA AND GOFF.
JARED GOFF, WHO WAS THE FIRST
OVERALL PICK IN 2016 WITH THE
RAMS.
TOOK THE RAMS TO SUPER BOWL LIII
IN 2018, LOST TO THE PATRIOTS,
13-3.
A COUPLE YEARS LATER TRADED TO
THE LIONS, IT WAS A SHOCK, IT
WAS A SURPRISE, CALLED IT THE
BEST THING THAT'S HAPPENED TO
HIM IN HIS CAREER, AND HE HAS
TAKEN OFF SINCE GETTING TO
DETROIT.
6 FOR 7 TONIGHT.
37 TOUCHDOWN PASSES A YEAR AGO.
PLAY ACTION.
HE'S GOT MONTGOMERY OUT OF THE
BACKFIELD, AND DAVID MONTGOMERY
GETS A BLOCK FROM LaPORTA AND
LOWERS HIS SHOULDER AND GETS 11.
MARLON HUMPHREY MISSED A TACKLE
ALONG THE WAY.
LaPORTA GOT IN THE WAY AND THEN
DAVID MONTGOMERY PUT AN
EXCLAMATION POINT AT THE END OF
IT.
Troy: GOOD JOB BY JARED GOFF
BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED, THE
RAVENS ARE TRYING TO DISGUISE
COVERAGE AND GO TO A TWO DEEP
HERE, AND HE KNOWS HE DOESN'T
HAVE WHAT HE WANTS DOWN THE
FIELD AND COMES DOWN
IMMEDIATELY.
CHECKS IT DOWN TO MONTGOMERY AND
THEN HE MAKES ROQUAN SMITH MISS,
AND THEN SAM LaPORTA, HE'S OUT
THERE MAKING A KEY BLOCK, SO
THIS HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL DRIVE
ALREADY, JUST GETTING THE BALL
OFF THEIR OWN GOAL LINE.
Joe: PLAY ACTION FROM GOFF.
AND HE'S GOING TO GO AND A NICE
PICKUP ON FIRST DOWN.
HE DOESN'T DO IT A LOT.
ONLY FIVE RUSHED YARDS THROUGH
THE FIRST TWO GAMES.
HE GETS FIVE HERE.
Troy: HE'S GOT ENOUGH.
HE CAN GET OUT OF DANGER EVERY
NOW AND THEN BUT, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S ALWAYS THIS CONVERSATION
ABOUT JARED GOFF THAT WHEN HE
HAD PRESSURE, THAT HE DIDN'T
HANDLE IT VERY WELL AND HE
PROBABLY DIDN'T REAL EARLY IN
HIS CAREER WHEN HE WAS WITH THE
RAMS.
HE HANDLES THE PRESSURE JUST
FINE, AS LONG AS HE DOESN'T HAVE
TO MOVE OFF HIS SPOT, BUT WHEN
YOU GET HIM OFF THE SPOT WITH
PRESSURE, THAT IS WHEN HE HASN'T
BEEN QUITE AS EFFECTIVE.
Joe: BOTH BACKS IN THE GAME.
GIBBS, NOWHERE TO GO.
MARLON HUMPHREY GOT THROUGH.
MALAKI STARKS FORCED HIM OUT AND
A LOSS OF THREE ON THE PLAY AS
THAT THING WAS BLOWN UP BY THIS
RAVENS DEFENSE.
Troy: WELL, MARLON HUMPHREY,
THIS GUY HAS BEEN DOING IT A
LONG TIME, AND FOR HIM TO BE ONE
OF THE BETTER COVER GUYS AND
THEN COME UP AND DO WHAT HE DOES
IN THE RUN GAME, YOU SEE THAT
FROM BOTH SIDES, WHETHER IT'S
THE LIONS' DBs OR THE RAVENS'
DBs, THESE GUYS ARE PURE
FOOTBALL PLAYERS.
TIP MY HAT TO THESE PERSONNEL
WHO BRING THEM IN.
HE'S BEEN PLAYING AT THAT LEVEL
FOR A LONG TIME.
Joe: THIRD DOWN AND EIGHT.
GOFF SLINGS IT.
LaPORTA, FIRST DOWN.
THAT IS BACK-TO-BACK THIRD
DOWNS.
HE'S FOUND SAM LaPORTA, WHO IS A
PRO BOWLER IN HIS ROOKIE YEAR
LAST YEAR, TAPERED OFF A LITTLE.
GETS 14 HERE.
Troy: WHEN YOU SHOW THE LOOKS
AS THE RAVENS ARE DOING THEY
DISGUISE THINGS, THEY TURN AND
TRY TO RUN UNDERNEATH THINGS AND
DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE
LANDMARKS, SO WHEN YOU COME OFF
THE BALL, SAM LaPORTA, JUST GO
WIT OR NOT AND YOU SEE THE OPEN
SPACE AND CHEMISTRY HE HAS WITH
GOFF.
PRETTY EASY CONNECTION.
Joe: LIONS MOVING THE
FOOTBALL.
KEEPING LAMAR JACKSON OFF THE
FIELD.
ON FIRST DOWN, MONTGOMERY.
BOY, THIS DEFENSIVE FRONT THAT
IS PLAYING WITHOUT ONE OF THE
BEST DEFENDERS, NOT JUST ON THE
RAVENS, BUT IN THE LEAGUE IN
NNAMDI MADUBUIKE HAS DONE A NICE
JOB UP FRONT IN THE RUN GAME.
Troy: THEY REALLY HAVE AND
WITHOUT KYLE VAN NOY, ANOTHER
PRO BOWL PLAYER, LED THE TEAM IN
SACKS LAST WEEK SO ZACH ORR, THE
DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, HAS HIS
HANDS FULL TONIGHT TRYING TO
COME UP WITH WAYS TO SLOW DOWN
THE OFFENSE BUT HE'S CHANGED
WHAT THEY DO A LITTLE BIT.
REMEMBER WINK MARTINDALE, THEY HECK,
THEY BROUGHT EVERYTHING IN THE
KITCHEN SINK AND EVEN WITH MIKE
MACDONALD, THEY WERE MORE --
IT'S NOT AS MUCH A BLITZING
DEFENSE AS THEY WERE IN THE
PAST.
Joe: GOOD CARRY BY
MONTGOMERY.
STRONG RUN.
HE'S ABOUT A HALF YARD SHORT OF
A FIRST DOWN.
THE FORMER THIRD ROUND PICK BY
THE BEARS CAME AS AN
UNRESTRICTED FREE AGENT TO THE
LIONS, AND HE AND GIBBS MAKE THE
BEST TANDEM IN THE LEAGUE.
Troy: YOU KNOW, SAM LaPORTA,
AS I WATCHED HIM THIS WEEK, I
THINK HE A VERY UNDERRATED
BLOCKER.
HE'S ONE OF THE BEST TIGHT ENDS
CATCHING THE FOOTBALL, BUT HE
GETS IN THERE AND HE MIXES IT UP
AND I TALKED TO DAN CAMPBELL
ABOUT IT THIS WEEK AND HE SAID
THAT'S THE AREA WHERE HE'S
IMPROVED THE MOST, AND HE HAS NO
RESERVATIONS OF HAVING HIM BLOCK
A DEFENSIVE END ONE-ON-ONE.
Joe: HERE'S GIBBS.
HE'S GOT THE FIRST DOWN.
SO, THE DRIVE WILL CONTINUE.
AND SAM LaPORTA IS ON THAT LONG
LIST OF IOWA TIGHT ENDS THAT
HAVE COME INTO THE NATIONAL
FOOTBALL LEAGUE AND JUST BEEN
OUTSTANDING.
Troy: YEAH, WHATEVER IS IN
THE WATER THERE, BOY, THEY'RE
RAISING THEM SOME GOOD TIGHT
ENDS.
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.
Joe: LOOK AT YOU GOING
COUNTRY ON THAT.
Troy: THERE'S SOME GOOD TIGHT
ENDS, BABY.
THIS DRIVE IS DEMORALIZING FOR A
DEFENSE.
YOU GOT THEM BACKED UP ON THEIR
OWN 2 YARD LINE TO START THIS
DRIVE, AND LIKE I SAID, THE
FIRST FIRST DOWN MADE IT A WIN
FOR THE DETROIT OFFENSE BUT
HERE, THEY'RE STILL ROLLING.
Joe: GOOD PROTECTION FOR
GOFF.
FLAG ON THE PLAY, AND THE
SECONDARY AND GIBBS IS FORCED
OUT WITH A GAIN OF NINE.
Troy: I THINK HENRIETTA IN ME
WAS COMING OUT THERE, JOE.
Joe: KITTLE IS ON THAT LIST.
DALLAS CLARK.
Referee: DEFENSE NUMBER 14.
TROH NOAH FANT.
Joe: GOES ON AND ON AND
CALLED IT AGAINST KYLE HAMILTON,
MR. ALL WORLD FOR THE RAVENS AS
HE WAS WORKING ON --
Troy: YOU CAN'T WATCH THE
RAVENS PLAY AND HAVE A
BROADCASTER NOT HIGHLIGHT KYLE
HAMILTON AND ALL THAT HE DOES.
WITH THAT SAID, I STILL DON'T
KNOW IF HE GETS THE CREDIT HE
DESERVES.
HE IS SOME KIND OF FOOTBALL
PLAYER.
Joe: FIRST DOWN CARRIED BY
MONTGOMERY AND HE ALMOST BROKE
IT.
A GAIN OF EIGHT.
BOY, THEY JUST KEEP COMING AT
YOU BECAUSE THEY CAN ROTATE THE
BACKS AND MONTGOMERY, HE'S NOT
THE SAME BACK AS GIBBS.
THEY'RE DIFFERENT TYPES.
Troy: THEY ARE BUT ON THIRD
AND ONE, WHO DID THEY GIVE THE
BALL TO?
JAHMYR GIBBS.
YOU GET LABELED THIS THIS
LEAGUE, AND I GET IT THAT
MONTGOMERY IS MORE OF THE
BETWEEN THE TACKLES PHYSICAL
RUNNER, WHICH HE IS.
BUT JAHMYR GIBBS, HE'S A TOUGH
RUNNER AS WELL.
SO THAT'S A HECK OF A ONE-TWO
PUNCH THAT THEY HAVE, AND IT'S
BEEN NICE TO SEE MONTGOMERY DO
WHAT HE'S DONE SINCE COMING FROM
CHICAGO TO DETROIT.
Joe: HAVEN'T CALLED HIS NAME
TONIGHT, ROQUAN SMITH.
HEARD IT A LOT LAST WEEK.
HE HAD AN ALL WORLD GAME AGAINST
THE BROWNS.
HERE IS MONTGOMERY GETTING TEN
AGAIN.
GIBBS AND MONTGOMERY HAVE DONE
SPECIAL THINGS SINCE 2023, AND
THEIR COMBINED RUSH TDs, THE
MOST BY ANY TEAMMATES ACROSS THE
NFL, GIBBS HAS A TOUCHDOWN
TONIGHT.
AND THEY ARE EASILY THE BEST DUO
AROUND THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL
LEAGUE, EACH HAS HAD OVER A
THOUSAND SCRIMMAGE YARDS AND TEN
PLUS TOUCHDOWNS EACH OF THE LAST
TWO YEARS AND THEY'RE THE FIRST
DUO THAT CAN SAY THAT IN NFL
HISTORY.
FIRST DOWN, LIONS.
INSIDE THE 20.
HERE'S GIBBS.
TRYING TO GET TO THE EDGE AND
THEY'VE DONE A NICE JOB ON GIBBS
SO FAR.
MIKE GREEN, WHO IS GOING TO GET
MORE WORK WITH THE INJURY TO VAN
NOY JUST A GAIN OF ONE.
Troy: WE TALKED ABOUT THESE
TWO YOUNG GUARDS, AND THE
STRUGGLES THEY HAD WEEK ONE, AND
THIS PLAY HERE, YOU SEE
MAHOGANY, HE LEADS UP ON THE
DOUBLE TEAM, GETS THE SECOND
LEVEL, SEALS OFF ROQUAN SMITH,
TATE RATLEDGE, HE DID JUST AS
WELL ON THE OTHER SIDE, AND
THOSE GUYS ARE SETTLED IN AND I
KNOW THAT WAS A REAL KEY FOR
JOHNNIE MORTON COMING IN, TRYING
TO LET THEM SETTLE IN AND I
BELIEVE THEY HAVE.
Joe: GIBBS, PICKING HIS WAY
AND A YARD, YARD AND A HALF
SHORT OF A FIRST DOWN AS MALAKI
STARKS, THE ROOKIE, MADE THE
STOP.
Troy: WELL, AGAIN, ANOTHER
LOOK WITH YUTO TOTSUKA AND
GRAHAM GLASGOW UP FRONT THIS
DOUBLE TEAM BETWEEN THE CENTER
AND GUARD, THEY WORK TO THE
THREE TECHNIQUE AND THEN AS THEY
MOVE UP, THEY GET TO THE
LINEBACKER LEVEL, AND IT'S JUST
AN OUTSTANDING JOB.
THESE GUYS ARE -- I MEAN, THIS
IS A TOUGH FRONT.
NOW, YOU MENTIONED IT, JOE,
WITHOUT MADUBUIKE AND YOU CAN'T
OVERSTATE HOW BIG OF A LOSS THAT
IS FOR THIS RAVENS GROUP.
Joe: THIRD DOWN AND ONE.
ST. BROWN IN THE BACKFIELD AND
GOFF JUST TAKES IT AND GETS IT.
I MEAN THIS, IS GOING TO BE A
NINE-PLUS-MINUTE DRIVE, AND A
DRIVE THAT STARTED INSIDE THEIR
OWN 2 AND NOW THEY'VE GOT A
FIRST AND GOAL WITH THE BALL
SITTING AT THE 9.
Troy: YEAH, THIS IS THE
SIGNATURE DRIVE OF THE THREE
GAMES.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT, THERE'S
NOTHING THAT FEELS BETTER.
THERE'S NNAMDI MADUBUIKE, WHO IS
NOT IN UNIFORM TONIGHT, NOT SURE
EXACTLY WHEN HE MIGHT BE BACK,
BUT WHAT A BIG LOSS THAT IS FOR
THIS RAVENS DEFENSE.
Joe: YEAH, THEY'RE KIND OF
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT NECK
INJURY.
HERE'S GIBBS, PERFECT THROW, AND
JUST SHORT OF THE END ZONE.
HIS KNEE MAY HAVE BEEN DOWN WHEN
HE GOT TO THE GOAL LINE.
THAT'S THE CALL ON THE FIELD.
AND THEY GOT IT RIGHT.
Troy: YEAH, GOOD CALL BY THE
OFFICIALS.
NICE JOB BY JAHMYR GIBBS AS HE
COMES OUT OF THE BACKFIELD.
IT'S A LITTLE QUICK ON THE
ANGLE.
HE DOESN'T QUITE GET STRAIGHT UP
THE FIELD BUT JUST SAW HE HAD
OPEN GRASS AND DOWN THERE TIGHT,
HE WAS GOING TO GIVE GOFF AN
AREA -- A PLACE TO GO WITH THE
FOOTBALL IMMEDIATELY AND THAT'S
THE OTHER PART OF IN THAT JAHMYR
GIBBS GIVES YOU.
I TALKED ABOUT HIS TOUGHNESS
INSIDE.
BUT HIM AS A RECEIVER, JUST
ANOTHER ELEMENT.
Joe: MONTGOMERY BACK WITH
GOFF ON SECOND AND GOAL.
MONTGOMERY GETS IT.
AND NO CALL.
THEY'RE SAYING HE'S SHORT.
NOW THE OTHER OFFICIAL SAYS
TOUCHDOWN.
THE NEAR OFFICIAL SAID HE DIDN'T
GET IT.
THE FAR OFFICIAL CAME IN AND
CALLS TOUCHDOWN AND LET'S JUST
MAKE SURE.
WHAT A DRIVE THAT WAS.
AND HE'S IN.
Troy: THAT'S AS GOOD AS IT
GETS.
IT'S GOOD NO MATTER WHO YOU'RE
PLAYING BUT WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING
ON THE ROAD AGAINST THIS RAVENS
DEFENSE, 98 YARDS, THAT'S PRETTY
IMPRESSIVE.
THAT'S A GOOD CALL.
YOU SEE THE BALL IN THE LEFT
ARM, AND SAM LaPORTA, HE LEADS
THE WAY THEN YOU GOT ST. BROWN,
HE'S HELPING TRY TO MAKE A BLOCK
AS WELL.
THAT IS ONE GREAT DRIVE.
Joe: THEY GO 98 1/2 YARDS AND
A DRIVE THAT TOOK OVER NINE
MINUTES.
Referee: PLEASE RESET THE
GAME CLOCK TO 5:55.
Joe: IF YOU DON'T WANT LAMAR
TO BEAT YOU HAVE HIM SIT ON THE
SIDELINE.
Troy: WE CAN STOP TALKING
ABOUT THESE TWO YOUNG OFFENSIVE
GUARDS.
GO 98 YARDS AGAINST THE RAVENS
AND RUN THE FOOTBALL THE WAY
THEY DID, THEY'RE SETTLED IN AND
GOOD TO GO.
Joe: BATES FOR THE EXTRA
POINT.
SEVEN-POINT LEAD.
I KEEP UNDERSELLING THAT DRIVE.
TEN MINUTES AND 48 SECONDS.
WOW!
A COUPLE OF BIG
TEAMMATES, ALL FOUR GUYS IN THE
HALL OF FAME ARE JAHMYR GIBBS
AND DAVID MONTGOMERY.
Troy: YOU LOOK AT THIS
ROSTER, JOE, IT'S JUST WHETHER
IT'S THOSE TWO OR OTHER
POSITIONS, I THINK WHAT HOLMES
HAS DONE WITH THE DEPTH ON THIS
FOOTBALL TEAM IS IMPRESSIVE AS
ANYTHING.
Joe: HERE IS RASHEEN ALI ABLE
TO BREAK OUT, AND THE KICKER,
BATES, GOT HIM AND BROUGHT HIM
DOWN AND SAVED THE TOUCHDOWN.
THAT WAS A TOUCHDOWN SAVING
TACKLE.
LET'S SEND IT DOWN TO
Laura:.
Laura: TROY TALKED A LOT
ABOUT THIS OFFENSIVE LINE FOR
THE DETROIT LIONS AND
SPECIFICALLY THE YOUNG GUARDS IN
TATE RATLEDGE AND GRAHAM GLASGOW
OVER ON THE SIDELINE GETTING
OXYGEN.
THEY'RE A LITTLE WINDED AFTER
THAT LONG DRIVE, NINE MINUTES,
OVER NINE MINUTES AND TATE
RATLEDGE WHEN HE CAME TO THE
SIDE, HE'S LIKE, THAT'S ONE OF
THE LONGEST DRIVES I'VE HAD IN
MY LIFE.
HE WAS SHAKING THE SWEAT OUT OF
HIS MULLET.
Troy: GET THE GUY SOME
OXYGEN.
Joe: IT'S GOT TO BE.
YOU CAN'T GO MUCH MORE.
IT WAS 98 1/2 YARDS.
I DON'T THINK THE FIELD IS MUCH
LONGER THAN THAT.
Troy: YOU CALLED IT.
BIG THIRD DOWN THROW TO START
THE DRIVE GOING WHEN THEY WERE
BACKED UP.
13 RUNS ON THAT 18-PLAY DRIVE,
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THAT
THEY'RE JUST RATTLING OFF A LOT
OF BIG RUNS, BUT THAT'S WHAT
YOU'VE GOT TO DO.
YOU'VE GOT TO STICK WITH IT SO
JOHN MORTON, THE OFFENSIVE
COORDINATOR, REALLY GOOD JOB OF
CONTINUING TO POUND THE
FOOTBALL, MIX IN THE PASSING
GAME, THAT WAS A THING OF
BEAUTY.
Joe: SECOND DOWN AND SIX.
WE'LL GIVE YOU THAT TACKLE BY
THE KICKER, JAKE BATES, THAT
SAVED A TOUCHDOWN.
HERE'S JACKSON TAKING OFF, AND
HE IS WRESTLED TO THE GROUND BY
BARNES.
DERRICK BARNES WITH A STRONG
TACKLE.
NO GAIN AND HERE'S THE TACKLE BY
THE KICKER, JAKE BATES AND IF IT
WASN'T HIM, IT WAS A KICK RETURN
FOR A TOUCHDOWN.
Troy: YEAH, YOU KNOW, HIS
EYES HAD TO BE LIKE SAUCERS,
ONE-ON-ONE AND HE'S THE LAST
LINE OF DEFENSE.
HE DID GOOD.
THAT'S -- HEY, WHATEVER IT
TAKES.
GET HIM ON THE GROUND.
Joe: FORMER BRICK SALESMAN IN
HOUSTON.
Troy: I HATE TO SAY WHAT HE
MIGHT HAVE BEEN DOING WITH THEM
BRICKS ON THAT LAST PLAY.
Joe: THEM BRICKS.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
JACKSON GETS OUT OF THERE AND
FIRES.
HE'S GOT BATEMAN FOR A FIRST
DOWN.
WHAT A PLAY BY LAMAR JACKSON,
EXTENDING IT, FORCING THESE
COVER GUYS TO STICK ON THEIR
RECEIVERS AND THAT'S GOOD FOR
TEN.
Troy: WELL, THAT'S JUST IT.
HERE THEY COME SO IT'S
MAN-TO-MAN.
THERE'S NOBODY IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE FIELD, AND AS A DEFENDER, I
MEAN, YOU'RE SITTING THERE
GOING, MAN, THE BALL HAS GOT TO
COME OUT AND LAMAR, HE'S ABLE TO
THROW THAT THING PERFECTLY.
Joe: WOW.
LAMAR JACKSON HAS THE NUMBER ONE
PASSER RATING OF ALL-TIME.
PLAY ACTION AND NOW THIS IS A
SHOT FOR WALKER SETTING UP FIRST
AND GOAL.
DEVONTEZ WALKER IN HIS SECOND
YEAR GOOD FOR --
Troy: YOU'RE PUTTING
CORNELIUSS ON AN ISLAND AND
WALKER WITH HIS SPEED IS COMING
OFF THE BALL AND TERRION ARNOLD,
I MEAN, HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S UP
AGAINST.
HE KNOWS THIS GUY CAN FLAT RUN
BY HIM, AND SO HE WITH THE SPEED
COMING OFF THE LINE OF
SCRIMMAGE, HE GETS ARNOLD TURNED
AROUND.
Joe: HERE IS HENRY.
HE IS TO THE 1.
DEVONTEZ WALKER CAME IN TONIGHT
WITH TWO CATCHES FOR TWO
TOUCHDOWNS, THREE CATCHES IN HIS
CAREER FOR THREE TOUCHDOWNS.
FOURTH ROUND PICK FROM NORTH
CAROLINA AND ALMOST GOT NUMBER
FOUR OF HIS CAREER ON THAT ONE.
Troy: YEAH, HE'S ALREADY MADE
SOME PLAYS WITH THE COUPLE
TOUCHDOWNS YOU TALK ABOUT AND
HE'S GOING TO BE A SPECIAL
PLAYER.
WHEN YOU HAVE A GUY LIKE HIM
WITH THAT KIND OF SPEED THERE'S
SO MUCH YOU GET TO DO WITH HIM.
Joe: HENRY, THEY STOPPED HIM.
NO GAIN ON THE PLAY AND YOU SEE
THE FRUSTRATION ON LAMAR
JACKSON'S FACE AND IT'S THIRD
AND GOAL.
Troy: WELL, THEY'RE TRYING TO
GO UP TEMPO.
WHEN THEY'VE HAD THE BIG PLAY,
THEY DID IT ON THEIR OPENING
DRIVE POSSESSION FOR A TOUCHDOWN
AND GOTTEN TO THE LINE QUICKLY.
SOMETIMES THAT'S GOOD AND
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU RUSH, YOU GET
THE OFFENSIVE LINEMEN NOT QUITE
DUG IN READY FOR THE BALL TO BE
SNAPPED, ND THEY DON'T COME OFF
IN SEQUENCE.
Joe: THAT WILL TAKE US TO THE
TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
A LITTLE FRUSTRATION FOR THE
RAVENS AS THEY GET DOWN THERE,
BUT NOW WILL FACE A THIRD AND
GOAL FROM THE 1. FRESH ALL
DAY LONG. I WANTED SOMETHING
THAT WORKS AND MANDO WORKS.
DID YOU SAY IT'S A COPYCAT
LEAGUE? IT'S BEEN A COPYCAT
GAME. THE LIONS GOT A TOUCHDOWN.
THE RAVENS ANSWERED. THE LIONS
WENT THREE AND OUT. THE RAVENS
WENT THREE AND OUT. THE LIONS
JUST GOT A TOUCHDOWN. AND
HERE'S A THIRD AND GOAL FROM
THE ONE FOR THE RAVENS TRYING
TO TIE THE GAME.
THEY GOT TWO DOWNS TO DO IT.
A LOT CAN HAPPEN THE REST OF
THE WAY. TWO MINUTES LEFT EACH
SIDE WITH ALL THREE TIMEOUTS
REMAINING. AS THE RAVENS HURRY
TO THE LINE. JUSTIN HENRY. HE
DOESN'T GET IT. CUNNINGHAM WAS
IN THERE ON THE STOP. AND IT'S
FOURTH DOWN AND GOAL. THE
OFFENSE WILL STAY OUT THERE FOR
JOHN HARBAUGH.
WOW. THAT'S SUCH A GREAT JOB
BY ZACH CUNNINGHAM. JUST
FILLING IT AND NOT GIVING
DERRICK HENRY AN OPPORTUNITY.
A HURRY AGAIN TO THE LINE.
LOSS OF ONE ON THAT PLAY.
FOURTH AND GOAL LAMAR KEEPS AND
IS IN TROUBLE. BALL'S OUT. AND
IT'S DETROIT'S BALL. JACK
CAMPBELL MADE THAT PLAY. AND
WHAT A JOB BY KELVIN SHEPHERD'S
LIONS DEFENSE BATES SAVED THE
TOUCHDOWN ON THE KICK RETURN
KELVIN SHEPHERD'S FIRED UP.
WHAT A JOB. JACKSON LOOKING TO
THROW CAMPBELL KNOCKED IT OUT. HAVE TO OVERPAY. NO
FEAR. JUST FOX. SAY, SHOW ME A
CARMAX.COM.
I MENTIONED HOW FAST THE
RAVENS WERE BREAKING THE HUDDLE
TO GET TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE.
THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD GIVE
HIM AN ADVANTAGE, BUT YOU SEE
HOW QUICKLY THE LIONS GET LINED
UP. THEY DID THAT ON THIRD DOWN.
THEY DID IT ON FOURTH DOWN.
THEY'VE DONE IT A FEW TIMES
EARLIER IN THIS BALL GAME. BUT
THE LIONS JUST SHOWED
TREMENDOUS DISCIPLINE OF BEING
PREPARED AND THEN EXECUTING.
AND ON THAT ONE LAMAR JACKSON
HE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY. THERE
WAS NOBODY OPEN NO SEPARATION.
AND THEN THERE'S THE GAME
SAVING OR EXCUSE ME, THE
TOUCHDOWN SAVING TACKLE BY
BATES. AWFULLY GOOD JOB BY
EVERYBODY. SPECIAL TEAMS
DEFENSE REALLY GOOD STUFF. NOT
ONLY.
DID THE RAVENS NOT SCORE,
BUT THEY LOST 18 YARDS ON THAT
FUMBLE BY LAMAR JACKSON. AND
THE BALL IS AT THE 20. WHAT A
PLAY BY JACK CAMPBELL. GOFF
SPINS OUT. CANNOT CONNECT WITH
JAHMYR GIBBS.
YEAH JACK CAMPBELL I AGREE
JOE. SUCH A GOOD PLAY BY HIM IN
HIS THIRD YEAR ANOTHER IOWA
PLAYER IOWA.
DEFENSE NUMBER 44 FIVE-YARD
PENALTY AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN.
THAT'S A PENALTY ON MARLON
HUMPHREY. SO THAT'S GOING TO
GIVE THE LIONS ANOTHER SET OF
DOWNS. BUT YEAH THIS DEFENSE
YOU KNOW WE TALK A LOT ABOUT
THE LOSS OF BEN JOHNSON ON THE
OFFENSE. BUT THEN AARON GLENN
GOES TO THE NEW YORK JETS AS A
HEAD COACH KELVIN SHEPPARD WHAT
AN IMPRESSIVE GUY HE IS. AS WE
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT PENALTY ON
HUMPHREY. BUT HE'S GOT THIS
GROUP PLAYING PRETTY GOOD
FOOTBALL.
ON FIRST DOWN. GOFF. OUT TO
HIS LEFT JUST THROWS IT AWAY.
MINUTE 12 LEFT. THREE TIMEOUTS
FOR DETROIT. TONIGHT'S TOTAL
REPLAY IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY
CHICK-FIL-A. DAVID MONTGOMERY.
THIS COMBINATION AND THE JOB UP
FRONT BY THOSE YOUNG GUARDS
YEAH.
AS I MENTIONED YOU TRY TO
GET THEM SETTLED IN AS BEST YOU
CAN. PART OF THAT IS NOT MAKING
THEM HOLD THEIR STANCE TOO LONG,
LETTING THEM COME OFF THE BALL.
SOME OF THE CALLS AND THE RUNS
AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. BUT
YOU WANT TO GET A PRETTY GOOD
TANDEM BETWEEN THOSE TWO GUYS.
AND THE STRENGTH HAS ALWAYS
BEEN THIS OFFENSIVE LINE. THE
OFFENSE IN GENERAL RUNS THROUGH
HIM WHEN THEY'RE DOING THEIR
JOB, EVERYTHING ELSE FLOWS.
QUICK THROW.
BLITZ WAS ON AND ODAFE OWEH
GOT THROUGH. IT'S A FORWARD
PASS. THEY'RE LETTING IT PLAY
ON. AND THE OFFICIALS ARE
LOOKING AT EACH OTHER. THEY'RE
TOLD TO LET IT PLAY. BUT THAT
SURE LOOKED LIKE A FORWARD PASS.
IF THAT'S NOT THEN I DON'T
KNOW WHAT A FORWARD PASS IS.
THIS ONE WILL DEFINITELY BE
A FORWARD PASS. WE'LL BRING
THIS ONE BACK.
AFTER REPLAY. SAYS IT'S AN
INCOMPLETE PASS. THIRD DOWN.
AND AWAY WITH A HIT ON GOFF.
THEY BROUGHT ROQUAN SMITH ON A
BLITZ. AND THAT OFFENSIVE LINE
WE WERE JUST RAVING ABOUT. HAD
A TOUGH TIME PICKING IT UP.
THEY DID.
THEY SHOWED BLITZ. AND SO
TAYLOR DECKER HE BLOCKED DOWN
AND IT GAVE A FREE RUN. THEN ON
GOFF. AND YOU CAN MAKE THE
ARGUMENT RUSSELL THAT THAT WAS
HELMET TO HELMET. IT WAS CLOSE
TO.
HELMET TO HELMET. BUT HE
STAYED A LITTLE LOW. I'M NOT
SURPRISED THEY DIDN'T CALL IT
THIRD DOWN AND TEN WITH THE
BALL SITTING AT THE 25. AMANRA
SAINT BROWN WELL PLAYED BY THE
RAVENS AND THE LIONS DO NOTHING
WITH THE BALL. NATE WIGGINS
MADE THAT STOP. AND THE CLOCK
WILL STOP TOUCHDOWNS THIS WEEK,
MOST IN FIVE YEARS. ALMOST HAD
ONE TONIGHT, IF NOT FOR JAKE
BATES AS JACK FOX WILL PUNT IT.
WEBSTER WAITING FOR IT. FLAG IS
DOWN. WEBSTER ON THE RETURN AND
HE GETS DROPPED AFTER HE
CROSSED THE 40.
HOLDING TEAM NUMBER 15. THE
TEN YARD PENALTY WILL BE ADDED
AT THE END OF THE RUN. FIRST
DOWN. TIME OUT.
AGAIN. GRANT STEWART WITH A
HOLD AND IT'LL BE GREAT. FIELD
POSITION FOR THE RAVENS.OCKET
MORTGAGE, OFFICIAL MORTGAGE
PROVIDER OF THE NFL.
GIVE YOU A LOOK AT THE HOLD
BY STEWARD AS HE GRABBED JAKE
HUMMEL, WHO WAS COMING THROUGH.
HUMMEL BLOCKED A PUNT AGAINST
THE BROWNS LAST WEEK.
YEAH, I THINK HE WOULD HAVE
HAD A SECOND ONE TONIGHT. IF
STEWART DOESN'T COME OVER AND
AND TACKLE HIM. ALTHOUGH
RUSSELL YORK DOESN'T SEEM TO
THINK HE DID ANYTHING WRONG. HE
DOES NOT.
AFTER THE RETURN OF THE
PENALTY, THE PUNT NETS JUST 24
YARDS. SO STARTING IN LIONS
TERRITORY JACKSON THERE HE GOES.
FIRST DOWN AND OUT OF BOUNDS.
TWO TIMEOUTS LEFT 48 SECONDS ON
THE CLOCK AND A FIRST DOWN. THE
RAVENS WHO CAME UP EMPTY THE
LAST TIME THEY WERE DOWN CLOSE.
WELL JUST TAKE A LOOK.
EVERYBODY'S IN MAN COVERAGE. SO
THEY HAVE THEIR BACK TO THE
QUARTERBACK. AND THAT'S YOU
KNOW THAT'S THE WEAKNESS OF A
MAN COVERAGE DEFENSE. AND WHEN
YOU'RE FACING LAMAR JACKSON IT
DOESN'T EVEN MATTER IF YOU HAVE
A SPY ON HIM WHICH THEY DON'T.
YEAH HE'S NOT GOING TO BE AS
FAST AS LAMAR IS. SO YOU KNOW
KELVIN SHEPPARD HE'S STICKING
TO KIND OF WITH THEIR DNA. AND
THAT IS PLAY PHYSICAL MAN
COVERAGE. BUT LAMAR JACKSON
ABLE TO GET A NICE PLAY ON.
FIRST DOWN.
JACKSON DUCKING AROUND IN
THE POCKET. AND NOW OUT TO HIS
RIGHT. HE FINDS HIS RUNNING
BACK JUSTICE HILL. AND HILL
WITH A NICE GAIN AS LAMAR
JACKSON. HE CAN EXTEND A PLAY
BETTER THAN ANYBODY IN THE NFL.
THAT WAS A GAIN OF FOUR.
YEAH. AND IT'S JUST IT'S
JUST HOLD ON. IF YOU'RE BACK
THERE IN THE SECONDARY AND YOU
KNOW THAT'S THE CHALLENGE FOR
KELVIN SHEPPARD. AGAIN FIRST
TIME DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR.
VERY IMPRESSIVE GUY. AND
VISITING WITH HIM. HE'S BEEN
WITH THE ORGANIZATION FOR THE
LAST SEVERAL YEARS WITH DAN
CAMPBELL. HE LEARNED UNDER
AARON GLENN. SAYS STEVE
SPAGNUOLO IS THE GUY WHO'S
INFLUENCED HIM THE MOST. BUT
WHETHER IT'S HIM OR AARON GLENN,
HE LEARNED FROM TWO AGGRESSIVE
DEFENSIVE COACHES.
SECOND DOWN AND SIX.
SIDELINE. HOPKINS. CATCH IS
MADE. AND A 13 YARD COMPLETION
FOR A FIRST DOWN.
HE DOES SUCH A GREAT JOB.
ONCE HE GETS TO THE SIDELINES
HE JUST STOOD THERE. YOU KNOW A
LOT OF LOT OF YOUNGER RECEIVERS
WILL TAKE OFF RUNNING AND NOT
KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT THEIR
QUARTERBACK MIGHT BE THINKING,
HOPKINS GOT OVER TO THE
SIDELINES. HE JUST STOPPED AND
THEN WAITED FOR LAMAR TO FIND
HIM AND MADE WHAT IS PRETTY
ROUTINE FOR HIM. DC YEAH.
THEY'RE SHORT. HE'S SHORT.
JACKSON. END ZONE. A LOT OF
CONTACT AND A FLAG. HOPKINS AND
TERRION ARNOLD. AND IT'S
AGAINST ARNOLD. YEAH.
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AND
SEE.
PASS INTERFERENCE. DEFENSE
NUMBER SIX. FIVE. FOUL.
AUTOMATIC. FIRST DOWN.
THERE WAS NO QUESTION. WHERE?
LAMAR. THERE'S THE GRAB. I
THINK IT'S A GOOD CALL. THERE
WAS NO QUESTION WHERE LAMAR WAS
GOING WITH THE FOOTBALL.
HOPKINS WAS OUT THERE ONE ON
ONE. NOW IT WAS A LINE DRIVE.
HE COULD HAVE LAID IT UP AND
MAYBE GIVEN HIM MORE OF AN
OPPORTUNITY. BUT, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A LOOK AT THE DEFENSIVE
PASS INTERFERENCE THAT HE HAD
LAST YEAR. IT'S BEEN A TOUGH
START THIS YEAR AS WELL. BUT
THE RAVENS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
HERE WITH 27 SECONDS TO SCORE.
THEY GET THE BALL AGAIN TO
START THE SECOND HALF. SO THEY
GET A THEY GET A CHANCE TO
DOUBLE UP.
IT'S FIRST DOWN AND GOAL.
FIRST AND GOAL. THEY GOT A
COUPLE TIME-OUTS BALTIMORE DOES.
SO THEY THEY GOT THE WHOLE
PLAYBOOK.
PLAY ACTION AND TOUCHDOWN
RAVENS BATEMAN.
GETS UP.
LOOKED LIKE THAT PLAY WAS
GOING TO THE RIGHT. AND LAMAR
JACKSON THREW BACK TO HIS LEFT.
YEAH IT WAS TOTALLY DESIGNED.
JOE YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT THAT
LAMAR JACKSON IS GOING TO SHOW.
LIKE HE'S GOING TO SPRINT OUT
TO HIS RIGHT. AND THEN RASHOD
BATEMAN IS GOING TO COME HERE
AND THEN BACK OUT. SO THE WHOLE
THING WAS DESIGNED WITH ZAY
FLOWERS THEN IN BEHIND THAT.
BUT A GOOD CALL. GET THE
DEFENSE FLOWING. COME BACK TO
BATEMAN FOR THE TOUCHDOWN.
DERRICK HENRY WITH A NICE
BLOCK ON AIDAN HUTCHINSON TO
FREE UP LAMAR JACKSON FOR THE
THREE YARD TOUCHDOWN PASS. AND
WE'RE TIED. RAVENS TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THE SHORT FIELD.
THEY STARTED AT THE LIONS 49.
AND THEY GO 49 YARDS IN 32
SECONDS.
THIS IS A HECK OF A BALL
GAME.
HALFTIME COMING UP JASON
KELCE. HOPEFULLY HE GOT HIS
WIND BACK.
THAT'S A THAT'S A CHIN STRAP.
IT'S NOT A NO STRAP.
HOW IS HE BREATHING. JASON
YOU CAN SAY NO.
YEAH. SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO
REMIND GUYS YOU KNOW.
GOOD FOR HIM. THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR HIM. THEY'RE
MISSING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND
OF SACKS THAT WAS. SOMEBODY LET
THE INTERNET TELL. ME A CROWD
SOURCE FOR WHAT THAT WAS
STANFORD. STEVE. THOSE TWO JUST
CHOPPING IT UP DOWN THERE.
CHOPPING IT UP? YEAH, JUST
TALKING BALL.
TALKING BALL.
LIKE HE DID ON THE PORCH.
AND.
HENRIETTA.
LIONS DO HAVE THREE TIMEOUTS.
IF DANGEROUS. DAN CAMPBELL
WANTS TO GET FRISKY HERE AT THE
END OF THE HALF.
YEAH, THAT'LL. LET'S SEE
WHAT THIS RETURN MIGHT LOOK
LIKE. RAYMOND.
KELLY TRIPPED UP AFTER
CROSSING THE 30. AND NOW
THERE'S 18 SECONDS LEFT. MONDAY
NIGHT LIGHTS. THESE TWO GUYS
LOVE PLAYING ON MONDAY NIGHTS.
THEY'RE THEIR CAREER NUMBERS.
EACH GUY, SEVEN AND TWO. HERE
ARE THE NUMBERS TONIGHT. I MEAN,
IDENTICAL RECORDS COMING IN AND
IDENTICAL TOTAL YARDS FOR THE
TWO STARTING QUARTERBACKS HERE
IN WEEK THREE.
YEAH. BOTH THESE
QUARTERBACKS TONIGHT HAVE HAD
EXCELLENT FIRST HALVES.
THEY ONLY HAD FOUR TOTAL
INCOMPLETE PASSES BETWEEN THE
TWO QUARTERBACKS. GOFF. HE JUST
RETURNED THAT KICK FOR RAYMOND
A GAIN OF FOUR. AND A TIMEOUT
IS TAKEN BY DETROIT. SO DAN
CAMPBELL IS PUTTING THE PEDAL
DOWN AS WE WELCOME YOU INSIDE
THE BROADCAST BOOTH JOE BUCK
AND THE NEW HENRIETTA AIKMAN
OVER HERE TO MY RIGHT. THIS. WE
THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD
GAME COMING IN AND IT HAS NOT
DISAPPOINTED AT ALL. BOTH TEAMS
REALLY IMPRESSIVE TONIGHT.
YEAH THEY THEY'VE BEEN GOOD.
BUT IT DID REMIND ME ONE YEAR I
THOUGHT THE SUPER BOWL WAS
GOING TO BE PLAYED IN HENRY.
BUT THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER STORY.
SO THIS FIRST HALF HAS LIVED UP
TO WHAT WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
COMING INTO THIS GAME. IT'S A
BIG GAME FOR BOTH THESE TEAMS.
WE TALKED ABOUT IT BEING A
MEASURING STICK AND AND IN A
LOT OF WAYS IT IS, ALTHOUGH
THEY'VE SHOWN ME ENOUGH THAT AS
LONG AS THESE GUYS CAN STAY
HEALTHY, LIKE THE LAST SEVERAL
OTHER YEARS, THEY'RE GOING TO
BE RIGHT THERE WHEN IT'S ALL
SAID AND DONE.
SECOND DOWN AND SIX.
BACKPEDALING AMANRA SAINT BROWN
MAKES THE CATCH AND BOY IS HE
SWARMED BY THE SECONDARY OF THE
RAVENS. T.J. TAMPA, WHO'S A
YOUNG CORNER. THEY LIKE THEY'RE
PLAYING AGAIN WITHOUT JAIRE
ALEXANDER, WHO THEY SIGNED
AFTER MANY YEARS IN GREEN BAY.
AND THEY FIGURED THAT AFTER
KNEE SURGERY AND THEN MISSING A
FEW WEEKS, HE MISSED THREE IN
AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER. HE JUST
WASN'T READY. THEY HOPE NEXT
WEEK WHEN THEY HAVE A DATE WITH
THE KANSAS CITY CHIEFS, THEY'LL
BE READY TO GO THERE AT KC NEXT
SUNDAY.
WELL, MARLON HUMPHREY
TALKING ABOUT GUYS BEING A
LITTLE BANGED UP ON THAT LAST
PLAY. HE GOT UP AND HE CAME
INTO THE GAME WITH A WITH A
GROIN. HE WAS QUESTIONABLE
THROUGHOUT THE WEEK WITH A
GROIN INJURY. I'M NOT SURE IF
THAT WAS MAYBE RE-AGGRAVATED OR
A KNEE OR AN ANKLE OR SOMETHING.
BUT THEY TOOK HIM OUT SEVEN.
SECONDS LEFT. IT'S THIRD.
DOWN AND THREE.
WITH ONE TIMEOUT. AND NOW
DEFENSIVELY THE RAVENS TAKE A
TIMEOUT. ESPN APP
TO WATCH ALL THE ACTION.
YOU KNOW JOE LOOKING AT THIS
RIGHT HERE I KNOW THERE'S SEVEN
SECONDS. THEY'RE BATTLING THAT
THEY NEED ABOUT 20 YARDS. AND
THEN THEY'RE AT JAKE BATES'S
CAREER LONG WHICH WOULD BE A 58
YARDER. SO IT'S NOT
INCONCEIVABLE. YOU KNOW THEY
GOT TO GET THE BALL OUT. GUY'S
GOT TO KNOW THAT IF THEY CATCH
THE BALL AND THEY'RE IN THAT
RANGE, GET DOWN. FULL TIMEOUT.
HERE'S AMON-RA SAINT BROWN.
DOWN HE GOES. AND THE LAST
TIMEOUT WILL BE TAKEN. THIS
LEAGUE HAS CHANGED. THAT WAS SO
SMART BY SAINT BROWN TO GET
DOWN. HE LEAVES TWO SECONDS ON
THE CLOCK. THEY USE THEIR LAST
TIME OUT. THIS LEAGUE HAS
CHANGED SO MUCH. WE'RE RIGHT
AROUND THE CORNER FROM THE
FIRST 70 YARD FIELD GOAL THAT
THIS LEAGUE HAS EVER SEEN. BUT
THESE TEAMS NOW GET AROUND
MIDFIELD AND THEY'RE THINKING
ABOUT FIELD GOALS.
YEAH I MEAN AND WELL
THINKING FIELD GOALS HERE AND
EVEN THE FACT THAT THEY WENT
FOR IT THERE, THERE WAS A TIME
NOT LONG AGO THAT WITH 20S WERE
ON THE CLOCK WHEN THEY GOT
POSSESSION OF THE BALL, THEY
WOULD HAVE JUST RUN IT OUT.
AND NOW THE RAVENS WILL
SPEND A TIMEOUT. THEY'RE GOING
TO PUT THE BALL DOWN AT THE 43
YARD LINE, WHICH WOULD MAKE IT
A 67 YARD FIELD GOAL. THAT
WOULD BE THE RECORD. IF HE HITS
THIS THE NFL RECORD. RIGHT NOW
THAT'S HELD BY JUSTIN TUCKER,
THE 13 YEAR KICKER LONGTIME
WITH THE RAVENS. THIS IS A 60
YARD TRY DURING THE PREGAME
THAT HE HIT. AND THIS IS BEYOND
THAT. 67 YARDS.
WELL IT'S WORTH AT LEAST A
SHOT. YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH WHEN
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS
DISTANCE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE NOT
GETTING THE BALL UP AS QUICKLY.
AND YOU KNOW IT GIVES AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS DEFENSE AS
WELL.
WESTERNERS WAITING IN THE
END ZONE, HE CAN RETURN IT. IT
FALLS SHORT AND BATES HIT IT.
THIS WOULD BE AN NFL RECORD.
GOOD. SNAP. GOOD. HOLD THE KICK.
IS NO GOOD. WIDE TO THE LEFT.
RAVENS WILL RECEIVE THE SECOND
HALF KICKOFF AS WE GIVE YOU
ANOTHER LOOK. AND WE'LL SEND IT
DOWN TO LAURA RUTLEDGE WITH DAN
CAMPBELL.
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU JOE.
NOW, THE KICK WASN'T GOOD THERE,
BUT HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE
OFFENSE AND THE WAY IT'S
FUNCTIONED SO FAR IN THIS GAME?
WELL, WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB.
YOU KNOW, WE WE'D HAVE BEEN A
LITTLE BIT BETTER THERE TOWARDS
THE END WHEN WE GOT THE BALL
BACK. MADE A HELL OF A STOP.
DEFENSIVELY. WE TALKED ABOUT
PLAYING COMPLEMENTARY FOOTBALL
AND HELPING EACH OTHER OUT. AND
WE'VE REALLY DONE THAT. SO
LISTEN I LIKE WHERE WE'RE AT.
WE GOT TO REGROUP. IT'S A GOOD
TEAM OVER THERE. BUT WE'LL
BOUNCE BACK. BE GOOD.
YOU CALLED OUT TIME OF
POSSESSION AS IMPORTANT IN THIS
ONE. YOU POSSESS THE BALL
ALMOST 20 MINUTES IN THAT FIRST
HALF. WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT
THAT?
WELL, THAT'S ONE OF THE
THINGS WE WANTED TO DO. YOU
KNOW, WE WERE ABLE TO SUSTAIN
DRIVES. WE GOT TO BESAID, HEY, ZAY FLOWERS
IS GOING TO GET THE BALL.
HE HAS GOTTEN THE BALL THE FIRST
COUPLE OF WEEKS AND HE'S THE
KEY, SO HE IS A FOCAL POINT FOR
THIS OFFENSE.
Joe: AIDAN HUTCHINSON
TONIGHT, HE'S BEEN ON THE LEFT
SIDE.
HE'S BEEN ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
MORE ON THE RIGHT TONIGHT, AND
ONE SNAP ON THE INTERIOR OF THE
DEFENSIVE LINE.
THIS IS ALI AND RASHEEN ALI OUT
ACROSS THE 25.
MOMENTS AGO LISA SALTERS CAUGHT
UP WITH JOHN HARBAUGH.
LD BROWN JOHN, YOU GET THE BALL
TO START THIS SECOND HALF.
THERE WAS SOME SUCCESS BUT ALSO
SOME FRUSTRATION ON OFFENSE IN
THE FIRST HALF.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO CLEAN UP?
WELL, WE'D LIKE -- LOVE TO
FINISH THAT DRIVE GOING IN BUT I
THOUGHT OUR DEFENSE DID A GREAT
JOB STEPPING UP AND GETTING THAT
SACK.
YOU GO FOR IT, PIN THEM BACK IN,
THAT'S THE WORST CASE SCENARIO
BUT THEN OUT TO THE 20 AND OUR
DEFENSE STEPPED UP SO I'M PROUD.
IT'LL BE THAT KIND OF GAME BACK
AND FORTH.
FIND THE WAY TO WIN THE NEXT
DRIVE.
Lisa: YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR
DEFENSE.
THAT 18-PLAY SEEMED TO TAKE A
LOT OUT OF THEM.
WHAT DID YOU LIKE ABOUT THE WAY
THEY BOUNCE BACK?
I DO APPRECIATE THAT.
I THOUGHT WE FOUGHT THROUGH THE
DRIVE.
WE JUST DIDN'T GET OFF THE FIELD
ON THIRD DOWN.
A LOT OF THIRD AND LONGS.
WE NEED TO GET OFF THE FIELD IF
WE CAN WHICH WE DID THE LAST TWO
DRIVES.
Lisa: THANK YOU, COACH.
Joe: LISA, THANK YOU.
JOHN, THANK YOU.
A LITTLE DROP-OFF PASS TO
DERRICK HENRY AND HE GOES
FORWARD FOR SEVEN AND WE'RE
UNDER WAY IN THE SECOND HALF.
SECOND DOWN AND THREE IN A TIE
BALL GAME.
Troy: HERE'S A LOOK AT AIDAN
HUTCHINSON, AND HE'S KIND OF
BEEN A LITTLE QUIET IN THE FIRST
HALF BUT DRAWS A LOT OF
ATTENTION SO GETS THE CHIP AND
DOUBLE TEAM AS HE'S BEEN WORKING
BOTH SIDES OF THE OFFENSIVE
LINE.
HE'S BEEN WORKING AGAINST RONNIE
STANLEY THEN TO THE OTHER SIDE
AGAINST ROGER ROSENGARTEN, BUT
THEY COME IN, CERTAINLY AS EVERY
OFFENSE DOES WITH A PLAN.
Joe: HENRY IS A YARD SHORT,
MAYBE A HALF YARD SHORT OF A
FIRST DOWN AS JACK CAMPBELL MADE
THAT STOP.
SO THIRD DOWN COMING UP.
SAID JUST THREW IT OUT THERE AS
YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS TONIGHT,
ONLY UNINCOMPLETION.
LAMAR JACKSON HAS THE BEST
PASSER RATING, THAT'S NOT --
DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE
RUNNING AT ALL, THE BEST PASSER
RATING IN THE HISTORY OF THE
LEAGUE.
Troy: I SAW THAT TODAY AS
WELL, JOE.
I DON'T WANT TO SAY I WAS AMAZED
BUT I WAS SURPRISED BUT IT DOES
SPEAK TO WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT
AND HOW MUCH HE HAS GROWN AND
HOW GOOD HE'S BEEN IN THE
POCKET.
AS THEY WERE ABLE TO GET THE
LIONS, WHAT LOOKED TO BE
OFFSIDES
Referee: DEFENSE, NUMBER 51.
BURROW, LINE UP
WHOEVER YOU WANT BEHIND THOSE
NAMES.
IT'S LAMAR JACKSON ON TOP.
Troy: WE TALKED ABOUT IT
BEFORE AND HEARD STEVE YOUNG
TALK ABOUT IT WHEN HE BECAME
FEARED IS WHEN HE BECAME A
PASSER AND LESS OF A RUNNER.
Joe: HERE'S A NEAR PICKOFF.
Troy: OH.
Joe: AND IT'LL NEVER BE ANY
EASIER FOR BRIAN BRANCH AND HE
JUST DROPPED IT.
Troy: HE READS IT PERFECTLY
AS WELL.
HAS HIS EYES BACK ON LAMAR AS
HE'S CARRYING IT UP THE FEEL AND
JUST DOES AN OUTSTANDING JOB.
IT'S MARK ANDREWS WHO IS IN THE
SEAM, EXCUSE ME, HE'S GOT MARK
ANDREWS BUT WORKING BACK TO THE
INSIDE AGAINST CHARLIE KOLAR AND
JUST BOUNCES OFF HIS HANDS.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THERE ARE GUYS THAT CAN'T CATCH
THE FOOTBALL.
BRIAN BRANCH IS NOT ONE OF THEM.
Joe: HE'LL BE THINKING ABOUT
THAT GOING TO BED TONIGHT.
SECOND DOWN AND TEN.
BLITZ COMING.
PASS IS CAUGHT BY ANDREWS, AND
CAMPBELL IN ON THE STOP, A GAIN
OF FOUR, THIRD DOWN.
Troy: I WAS TALKING ABOUT IT
WITH STEVE YOUNG AND HE HAS
TALKED TO OTHER QUARTERBACKS
THAT HAVE COME INTO THIS LEAGUE
ABOUT, YEAH, IT'S GREAT TO BE
ABLE TO RUN BUT ULTIMATELY YOU
GOT TO BEAT DEFENSES WITH YOUR
ARM.
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE A
CHAMPIONSHIP QUARTERBACK AND
WE'VE SEEN THAT FROM LAMAR, I
MEAN, THEY'VE GOT A GREAT SCHEME
AND THEY'VE GOT REALLY GOOD
PLAYERS AROUND HIM BUT WATCHING
HIM THROW THE FOOTBALL THE WAY
HE HAS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL
YEARS NOW WITH TODD MONKEN AS
THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, IT'S
BEEN IMPRESSIVE AND WHAT WE
SHOWED WITH THAT GRAPHIC, HIM
BEING RATED NUMBER ONE PASSER
RATING, PRETTY GOOD.
Joe: THIRD DOWN.
THERE'S HIS FIRST TARGET.
THERE'S HIS FIRST CATCH.
FLOWERS AND THEY'RE GOING TO
GIVE HIM A FIRST DOWN.
ZAY FLOWERS GETS HIS FIRST.
THEY GOT A GOOD SPOT, AND FIRST
DOWN FOR BALTIMORE.
Troy: A LITTLE PICK WITH MARK
ANDREWS AS HE COMES OFF THE
BALL, AND ZAY FLOWERS COMES
UNDERNEATH.
THEY'RE ANTICIPATING MAN
COVERAGE BECAUSE THEY'RE SO
HEAVY WITH DETROIT'S COVER ONE,
AND GOOD CALL, GOOD EXECUTION
AND THEY'RE ABLE TO FINALLY FREE
HIM UP FOR THE COMPLETION.
Joe: CATCH NUMBER 15 ON THE
SEASON, FIRST OF THE NIGHT.
THERE'S TODD MONKEN.
A JOB HE HAS DONE, NUMBER 3, HIS
OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR FOR JOHN
HARBAUGH AND LAMAR JACKSON.
HERE'S HENRY.
AND DERRICK ABLE TO TAKE IT
INSIDE THE 45.
GOT FOUR.
Troy: YOU KNOW, EVEN WITH
THAT SAID WHEN WE TALK ABOUT
WHAT LAMAR'S DONE THROWING THE
FOOTBALL, MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS
IS STILL AN OFFENSE THAT JUST
WANTS TO BE PHYSICAL AND RUN THE
FOOTBALL AND SO EVEN WHEN YOU
LOOK AT THE YARDS, THE PASSING
YARDS, IT DOESN'T REALLY TELL
THE ENTIRE STORY.
LAST YEAR THEY WERE SEVENTH IN
THE LEAGUE IN PASSING YARDS, BUT
THEY WERE NUMBER ONE IN YARDS
PER PASS, SO THAT'S A BETTER
INDICATOR AS JUST HOW EFFECTIVE
THEY ARE THROWING THE FOOTBALL
BECAUSE THEY'LL RUN IT MORE THAN
OTHER TEAMS.
Joe: SECOND DOWN AND SIX.
JACKSON KEEPS, WIDE OPEN IS
KOLAR AND HE'S GOT A FIRST DOWN
AFTER BREAKING A TACKLE AND THE
BALL JUST OUTSIDE THE 25.
18 YARDS FOR CHARLIE KOLAR.
Troy: WELL, CHARLIE KOLAR, I
KNOW HE DOESN'T GET MANY
OPPORTUNITIES, THAT'S HIS FIRST
TARGET, BUT THEY JUST TOTALLY
TURN HIM LOOSE.
I MEAN, THEY DON'T EVEN WORRY
ABOUT HIM COMING OFF THE
FOOTBALL AND THAT'S -- YOU
COULDN'T GO OUT THERE AND
PRACTICE AND HAVE IT ANY EASIER
THAN THAT.
Referee: THE BALL WILL BE
SPOTTED AT THE 29 YARD LINE.
FIRST DOWN.
Joe: THEY'LL SAY THE KNEE WAS
DOWN OR SOME BODY PART WAS DOWN
ON THAT LAST LUNGE BY KOLAR, AND
THEY MOVE THE BALL BACK TO THE
29.
THEY MOVED IT BACK THREE YARDS.
FIRST AND TENSION.
THEY'RE WITHOUT ISAIAH LIKELY.
HE BROKE HIS FOOT AT THE END OF
JULY.
HAD FOOT SURGERY ON HIS RIGHT
FOOT AUGUST 1st, AND HE IS CLOSE
TO COMING BACK AND ANOTHER
WEAPON FOR LAMAR JACKSON.
Troy: YOU COMBINE THAT WITH
PATRICK RICARD, THEIR FULLBACK,
WHO IS A BIG PART OF THIS
OFFENSE.
SO THEY'RE MISSING SOME KEY
GUYS.
Joe: FLOWERS IN MOTION.
JACKSON KEEPS, ANDREWS GOT IT.
STRONG CATCH BY MARK ANDREWS.
AGAINST BRIAN BRANCH FOR 20.
Troy: AND HE WAS OPEN A LOT
SOONER AS HE CAME OFF THE BALL.
PLAY ACTION BUT BRIAN BRANCH IS
LOCKED UP ONE-ON-ONE.
HE'S NOT EVEN LOOKING IN THE
BACKFIELD.
HE HAS HIS EYES ON ANDREWS BUT
ANDREWS JUST COMES OFFER THE
BALL, RUNS RIGHT PAST HIM SO HE
HAD A LOT OF SEPARATION BUT
LAMAR WASN'T READY TO THROW THE
FOOTBALL AT THAT TIME.
THEN IT BECAME CONTESTED.
THAT'S A GREAT JOB BY ANDREWS
GOING UP AND MAKING A PLAY.
Joe: BRANCH COULDN'T MAKE
THAT PLAY.
COULDN'T MAKE THE INTERCEPTION
EARLIER ON THIS POSSESSION.
Troy: YEAH.
Joe: FIRST AND GOAL RIGHT AT
THE 10.
HENRY IS GOING TO THROW, LOBBING
IT AND THAT COULD HAVE BEEN
PICKED OFF BY D.J. REED.
TYLAN WALLACE WAS THE TARGET,
AND AN ILL-ADVISED PASS.
THE RAVENS ARE LUCKY THAT WASN'T
INTERCEPTED.
Troy: YEAH, AS SOON AS HE
SLOWS UP, AS SOON AS DERRICK
HENRY SLOWS UP, IT DIDN'T LOOK
GOOD BUT HE HAD LAMAR JACKSON
OUT THE OTHER SIDE IF HE HAD
STOPPED AND LOOKED AND YOU KNOW
IN PRACTICE THEY HAD TALKED TO
HIM SAYING, HEY, LAMAR JACKSON
IS AN OUTLET IF YOU WANT TO GET
BACK TO IT.
THEY TOTALLY TURNED HIM LOOSE
BUT AS SOON AS HENRY STOPPED AND
KIND OF DOUBLE CLUTCHED IT WAS
NOT GOOD.
HE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE JUST
THROWN IT AWAY.
Joe: NOW SECOND AND GOAL.
JACKSON TRYING TO FIND SOMEWHERE
TO GO.
BROUGHT DOWN FROM BEHIND.
AND THAT IS A AL-QUADIN MUHAMMAD
WHO THEY'LL COUNT ON A LOT AFTER
THE INJURY TO MARCUS DAVENPORT,
HE GETS HIS SECOND SACK.
Troy: WILL, WHEN WE TALKED TO
TODD MONKEN, HE SAID LAMAR
JACKSON, IT'S KIND OF THE PRICE
OF PLAYING BUSINESS OR COST OF
DOING BUSINESS, EXCUSE ME, THAT
HE DOESN'T THROW IT AWAY.
YOU KNOW, THAT HE'S GOING TO TRY
TO MAKE A PLAY AND HE TRIED TO
THERE THEN LOST SOME YARDS.
Joe: SINCE LAST YEAR, JUST,
WELL, UNDER ONE ON AVERAGE THROW
AWAY A GAME.
NUMBER TWO IN THE LEAGUE TO
BAKER MAYFIELD AND NOW ON THIRD
DOWN, ANDREWS, DIVING CATCH,
TOUCHDOWN, RAVENS!
Troy: ALEX ANZALONE IS IN
COVERAGE.
PRETTY GOOD COVERAGE ACTUALLY.
HE'S LOCKED UP MAN-TO-MAN AND
THIS IS JUST -- IT'S A GOOD
ROUTE BY ANDREWS AND THEN IT'S
JUST A PERFECTLY THROWN BALL BY
JACKSON.
HE JUST LAYS IT OUT THERE AND
GIVES MARK ANDREWS AN
OPPORTUNITY TO JUST GO MAKE A
PLAY BUT NOT BAD COVERAGE
OVERALL BY ANZALONE TRYING TO
STICK WITH MARK ANDREWS, JUST A
PERFECTLY THROWN BALL.
Joe: ON A PERFECT NIGHT FOR
ANDREWS.
THE EXTRA POINT NOW BY LOOP.
SEVEN-POINT RAVENS LEAD.
MARK ANDREWS, THEY WANTED TO GET
HIM INVOLVED TONIGHT.
WELL, THEY HAVE, FIVE TARGETS,
FIVE CATCHES, 64 YARDS, AND A
TOUCHDOWN.
14 YARDS AWAY.ATTITUDE, WHICH THEY
WEREN'T WORRIED ABOUT AT ALL.
HE'S RESPONDED AND RESPONDED
WELL.
Troy: A GUY WHO'S DONE SO
MUCH FOR THIS ORGANIZATION TO
HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT
THROUGHOUT THE OFF-SEASON, HE'S
HAD HIMSELF A NIGHT.
YOU KNEW IT WAS COMING.
YOU DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN BUT
HE'S JUST BEEN TOO VALUABLE TO
THIS OFFENSE.
Joe: THAT WAS SHORT.
Referee: 15 OR 33, BALL WILL
BE PLACED AT THE 40 YARD LINE.
FIRST DOWN.
Joe: THAT'S THE SECOND TIME
THAT TYLER LOOP, THE ROOKIE HAS
BEEN SHORT OF THE LANDING ZONE
AND THAT MEANS THE BALL COMES
OUT TO THE 40 SO HE'S HAD A
COUPLE OF BAD KICKOFFS AND NOW
ADDS ANOTHER.
CHECK IN WITH LISA IN A MOMENT.
AND SEEING A LOT OF THESE
KICKERS THAT ARE TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WAYS TO JUST GET IT
INTO THE LANDING ZONE AND HE WAS
JUST SHORT OF DOING THAT.
Troy: GETS COSTLY WHEN YOU'RE
IN A GAME LIKE THIS AGAINST AN
OFFENSE LIKE THE LIONS.
Joe: GOFF, LOW FOR JAMESON
WILLIAMS.
LET'S CHECK IN WITH LISA.
Lisa: YEAH, JOE, LAMAR
JACKSON TOLD US THIS WEEKEND HE
WAS NOT WORRIED A BIT ABOUT MARK
ANDREWS OR HIS STATE OF MIND
COMING INTO THIS GAME WITH JUST
TWO CATCHES FOR SEVEN YARDS.
HE SAID MARK IS GOOD AND HE
REMINDED US ANDREWS GOT OFF TO A
SLOW START LAST YEAR, SIX
CATCHES FOR 65 YARD, ZERO
TOUCHDOWNS THROUGH THE FIRST
FOUR WEEKS OF 2024 AND FINISHED
WITH 11 TOUCHDOWNS SO LAMAR
SAID, WE START THE SAME EVERY
YEAR, EVERYBODY ELSE GETS THE
BALL THEN DEFENSES TAKE THEIR
EYES OFF MARK AND HE GOES CRAZY.
Joe: HE'S GONE CRAZY TONIGHT.
GIBBS, NICE RUN, AND HE GOT HIT
AND HIT HARD BY CHIDOBE AWUZIE.
LONGTIME CORNER IN THE LEAGUE
BUT A GAIN OF SEVEN, THIRD AND
THREE COMING UP.
HERE'S THE HIT BY AWUZIE.
Troy: AWUZIE, I MENTIONED IT.
YOU SEE THE HIT, THAT'S A
BIG-TIME HIT AND WHEN YOU WATCH
BOTH THESE DEFENSES PLAY,
AWUZIE, HE'S A COVER CORNER.
HE'S A GOOD PLAYER, BUT WHETHER
IT'S FOR THE RAVENS OR FOR THE
LIONS, IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT
YOU'RE A COVER CORNER, YOU
BETTER BE A TACKLER AS WELL.
AND FOR THE MOST PART ALL THESE
DEFENSIVE BACKS ARE.
Joe: THIRD DOWN AND THREE.
GOOD PROTECTION.
GOOD THROW AND LaPORTA HAS FOR
CONVERSION ON THIRD DOWN.
HE COULDN'T HAVE HANDED IT TO
HIM ANY BETTER THAN THAT.
WHAT A THROW.
Troy: ROQUAN SMITH IS THE ONE
WHO IS IN COVERAGE, AND HERE HE
IS AND HE DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB
AS LaPORTA COMES OUT, HE ACTS
LIKE HE'S GOING TO GO BREAK
OUTSIDE, COMES BACK IN, BUT THE
BALL HAD TO BE THROWN JUST
PERFECTLY AS IT WAS.
Joe: LaPORTA'S GOT THREE
CATCHES ALL ON THIRD DOWNS AND
ALL HAVE CONVERTED.
THEY HAND TO GIBBS.
AND THEY'VE STAYED WITH A RUN.
GIBBS GETS TEN.
Troy: WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE
LIONS LAST YEAR, JOE, TALKING
ABOUT THIRD DOWNS, THEY WERE
FOURTH IN THE NFL CONVERTING
THIRD DOWNS AND HASN'T BEEN
GREAT, THE FIRST COUPLE WEEKS OF
THE SEASON, AND IT'S BEEN EVEN
WORSE WHEN IT'S BEEN THIRD AND
SIX PLUS.
I MEAN, THEY CONVERTED 1 OF 14
COMING INTO THE GAME TONIGHT AND
YET THEY'VE DONE A HECK OF A
JOB.
THERE'S A LOOK AT JOHN MORTON
AND THEY'RE CONVERTING 70%.
THAT 98-PLAY OR 98-YARD DRIVE
THEY HAD, A LOT OF THIRD DOWN
CONVERSION, GOFF'S BEEN GOOD ON
THAT DOWN.
Joe: AND GIBBS SHORT SO PICKS
IT UP ON SECOND AND LESS THAN
ONE, JOHN JENKINS, 13-YEAR PRO
FROM GEORGIA.
MADE THAT TACKLE BUT NOT BEFORE
A FIRST DOWN PICKUP BY JAHMYR
GIBBS.
WE SAW JOHN MORTON WITH THE
LIONS TAKES OVER FOR BEN
JOHNSON, WHO THREE YEARS IS THE
OC IN DETROIT.
THEY LED THE LEAGUE IN POINTS
PER GAME.
18th YEAR IN THE LEAGUE AS A
COACH FOR MORTON.
SPENT THE LAST TWO SEASONS WITH
SEAN PAYTON IN DENVER.
BUT HE WAS WITH DETROIT BEFORE
HE WENT TO DENVER, VERY
COMFORTABLE COMING BACK IN
CALLING PLAYS.
ON FIRST DOWN, A TOSS TO
MONTGOMERY.
THROWS BACK TO GOFF.
WHO AIRS IT OUT FOR ST. BROWN.
WHAT A PLAY.
AND WHAT A TIME TO SHOW JOHN
MORTON AS THEY GO INTO THEIR BAG
OF TRICKS AND COME UP WITH THAT
FOR 17.
Troy: BUY A LITTLE TIME.
A LITTLE TRICKERY.
TAKE THE HOME RUN SHOT IF YOU
HAVE IT.
IF YOU DON'T, THEN YOU GET AN
OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO TAKE THAT
INTERMEDIATE THROW WHICH IS
EXACTLY WHAT HE DOES, INITIALLY,
YOU LOOK AT THIS AND SAY, OKAY,
WAS IT BACKWARDS.
IT WAS BACKWARDS SO DO A HECK OF
A JOB THERE AS FAR AS THE
EXECUTION GOES AND THEN GOFF
BEING PATIENT AND NOT BEING TOO
GREEDY ON THE PLAY.
Joe: ST. BROWN IN MOTION.
GOFF FOR ST. BROWN.
HE IS THERE AND HE'S GOT IT.
TOUCHDOWN, DETROIT.
WHAT A THROW AND CATCH.
WORKING AGAINST MARLON HUMPHREY
AND EXTRA POINT AWAY FROM A TIE
GAME.
Troy: JARED GOFF AT THE TOP
OF HIS GAME.
ONE, AN EXCELLENT ROUTE BY
AMON-RA ST. BROWN, DOUBLE MOVE
ON MARLON HUMPHREY, SO GOFF
ISN'T SO MUCH WORRIED ABOUT ST.
BROWN WINNING ON THE ROUTE, HE'S
GOT TO HOLD HAMILTON.
HAMILTON, THE SAFETY, IS
WATCHING AS WELL, AND HE HAS TO
HOLD HIM TO KEEP HIM FROM GOING
OVER THE TOP.
HE DOES THAT PERFECTLY, AND THEN
THROWS A GREAT BALL.
Joe: WHAT AN ANSWER BY
DETROIT.
SEVEN PLAYS, 60 YARDS IN 3:30.
WE'RE TIED AT 21.
IT'S LIKE A HEAVYWEIGHT FIGHT.
THESE TWO TEAMS JUST STANDING INJoe: AMON-RA ST. BROWN HONORS
HIS HERITAGE BY HOSTING YOUTH
SUMMER CAMPS IN GERMANY.
HIS MOTHER IS GERMAN, AND IT WAS
FOOTAGE FROM A JUNE VISIT.
HE VISITED A PRESCHOOL HE
ATTENDED IN VERKUSEN WHICH
BORDERS THE CITY OF COLOGNE.
HE SPEAKS TO HIS MOTHER IN
GERMAN DETAILED IN "MONDAY NIGHT
COUNTDOWN."
HE JUST TOOK IT INTO THE END
ZONE ON THAT BEAUTIFUL THROW
FROM GOFF, AND NOW JAKE BATES
KICKS IT OUT.
Referee: BALL WILL BE PLACED
AT THE 40 YARD LINE.
Joe: DOWN TO LAURA RUTLEDGE.
Laura: JOE, AMON-RA ST. BROWN
SAID BEING GERMAN IS REALLY
IMPORTANT TO ME.
REALLY A CRUCIAL PART OF MY
LIFE.
AS YOU MENTIONED, HE ONLY SPEAKS
GERMAN TO HIS MOM SO HE GETS A
LOT OF PRACTICE WITH IT BUT
REALLY GERMAN WAS HIS FIRST
LANGUAGE GROWING UP.
HIS MOM ONLY SPOKE GERMAN IN THE
HOUSE TO HIM AND HIS BROTHERS
AND GOES BACK TO GERMANY ONCE A
YEAR.
HE LOVES THE CULTURE AND LOVES
CELEBRATING IT.
Joe: WELL, HIS FAMILY IS VERY
PROUD OF THEM.
THEY HAVE AN EXTREMELY ATHLETIC
FAMILY AS ZAY FLOWERS MAKES HIS
SECOND CATCH.
A LITTLE CATCH AND RUN.
GOT A GOOD BLOCK FROM MARK
ANDREWS WHO HAD A TOUCHDOWN THE
LAST TIME THE RAVENS HAD THE
BALL IN A GAIN OF SEVEN.
Troy: YOU MENTIONED AMON-RA
ST. BROWN AND I TALKED ABOUT THE
JOB THAT BRAD HOLMES ALSO DONE
AS GENERAL MANAGER ACQUIRING
TALENT.
WHEN HE IS A FOURTH ROUND PICK
AND THE QUARTERBACK SAYS HE'S
THE BEST RECEIVER THE
QUARTERBACK HAS EVER THROWN TO
AND YOU NAME A FEW OF THEM OVER
THE YEARS, THAT KIND OF TELLS
YOU WHAT BRAD HOLMES HAS DONE
WITH THIS ROSTER.
Joe: SECOND DOWN AND THREE.
LAMAR JACKSON IS GOING TO BE
WRAPPED UP BY MUHAMMAD.
HIS SECOND OF THE NIGHT.
AL-QUADIN MUHAMMAD, HE IS WITH
HIS FIFTH TEAM.
IN HIS SEVENTH YEAR.
30 YEARS OLD, AND THEY ARE
REALLY GOING TO BE LEANING ON
HIM.
Troy: YES, THEY ARE AND
WHATEVER HE MAY LACK IN ABILITY
HE MAKES UP FOR IN HIS
TENACIOUSNESS IN THE WAY IN
WHICH HE CONTINUES TO COMPETE
AND BATTLE AND THE EFFORT THAT
HE GIVES AND THAT'S WHAT ALLOWS
HIM TO MAKE THE PLAY HERE.
I MEAN, HE DEFINITELY IS BEING
RELIED ON.
YOU LOSE MARCUS DAVENPORT AND
OTHERS HAVE TO BE ABLE TO COME
IN AND KIND OF FILL THAT VOID
AND THEY TRUST THAT HE'LL DO IT.
Joe: THIRD LIONS SACK OF THE
NIGHT.
JACKSON, INCOMPLETE FOR BATEMAN
WHO GETS HIT BY BRANCH.
SO, AFTER THE KICKOFF OUT OF
BOUNDS AND FIELD POSITION AT
THEIR OWN 40, THE RAVENS DON'T
DO ANYTHING WITH IT AND A PUNT
IS NEXT.
Troy: IT'S NOT EASY TO DO FOR
THIS DEFENSE.
GIVEN THAT KIND OF FIELD
POSITION, AND FORCE A THREE AND
OUT AND GET THE BALL BACK TO
YOUR OFFENSE, THAT'S WELL DONE.
Joe: JORDAN STOUT WILL PUNT
IT WITH KALIF RAYMOND WAITING
RAYMOND AVERAGING ABOUT 7 1/2
YARDS PER RETURN.
STOUT HITS IT, BOOMING PUNT,
RAYMOND THIS TIME LETS IT GO
OVER HIS HEAD AND THIS TIME IT
CHECKS UP CAN YOU NOT WATCHING THIS
GAME WITH A COLD BEER?
Joe: THIS IS NOT THE WORST
STARTING FIELD POSITION FOR THE
LIONS TONIGHT.
REMEMBER THEY STARTED INSIDE
THEIR OWN 2 AND WENT 98 YARDS,
98 1/2 TO BE EXACT.
Troy: WELL, THE WHOLE KEY IS
GETTING THAT FIRST FIRST DOWN AS
I TALKED ABOUT.
GIVE ROOM FOR YOUR PUNTER, JACK
FOX, IF YOU, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
NOT ABLE TO KEEP THE BALL, BUT
THAT'S THE FIRST THING ON JARED
GOFF'S MIND IS JUST TRYING TO
GET A NEW SET OF DOWNS ON THIS
POSSESSION.
Joe: MONTGOMERY IS ABLE TO
GET THROUGH, AND GET 11.
STRONG RUN BY DAVID MONTGOMERY,
AND A GOOD JOB YET AGAIN BY THIS
RESHUFFLED OFFENSIVE LINE OF THE
LIONS.
Troy: JUST WATCHED THEM COME
OFF THE BALL AND THE JOB THEY
DO.
I MEAN, IT'S JUST EXCELLENT
WORK.
YOU GOT GUYS AND, AGAIN, SAM
LaPORTA.
WE HIGHLIGHTED HIM AND WHAT HE'S
ABLE TO DO AND A BIG PART OF IT.
Joe: SO THEY GET THAT
BREATHING ROOM AND THE BALL
SITTING AT THEIR OWN 15.
MONTGOMERY STAYS IN.
THEY FAKE IT TO HIM.
THROW TO AMON-RA ST. BROWN.
AND IT'S OUT OF HIS REACH.
ONE OF THE RARE ERRANT THROWS BY
GOFF ALL NIGHT.
Troy: YEAH, THAT'S ONE HE'D
PROBABLY LIKE TO HAVE BACK.
GOING BACK TO THE OFFENSIVE
LINE, HANK FRALEY PLAYED IN THE
LEAGUE A LONG TIME AND BEEN A
LONGTIME COACH AS WELL.
HE WAS HERE BEFORE DAN CAMPBELL
IN DETROIT.
THIS IS HIS EIGHTH YEAR AS THE
OFFENSIVE LINE COACH WITH THE
LIONS.
HE CAME IN WITH MATT PATRICIA
BUT A QUALITY COACH.
HE'S BEEN AROUND SOME GOOD
OFFENSIVE MINDS, AND HE'S HAD
HIS WORK CUT OUT FOR HIM THIS
YEAR, AND HE'S GOT THEM PLAYING
TONIGHT.
Joe: HERE'S ANOTHER GOOD RUN
BY MONTGOMERY.
HE IS OUT BEING CHASED BY
HUMPHREY, AND BROUGHT DOWN NEAR
WHAT A RUN BY DAVID MONTGOMERY
BEHIND THAT OFFENSIVE LINE, AND
A BIG PLAY HERE TONIGHT.
Troy: YEAH, JUST AN EXCELLENT
JOB UP FRONT.
YOU GOT THE RIGHT GUARD ROOKIE
TATE RATLEDGE AND PENEI SEWELL
ALONG WITH SAM LaPORTA, AND IT'S
JUST EXCELLENT BLOCKING ON THAT
SIDE AND THEN MONTGOMERY'S GOT
THE CREASE, IS ABLE TO MAKE A
GUY MISS AND OFF AND RUNNING.
Joe: 72 YARDS, THIRD LONGEST
RUN OF THE CAREER OF DAVID
MONTGOMERY, NOW, GIBBS.
THAT BALTIMORE DEFENSE HAS TO BE
A BIT WINDED ESPECIALLY MARLON
HUMPHREY WHO HAD TO COME OUT
AFTER CHASING MONTGOMERY DOWN
THE FIELD AND DAVID IS COMING
BACK IN.
AFTER GIBBS GETS FIVE.
Troy: YOU LOOK AT THIS GAME
AND THE WORST THE FIELD POSITION
GETS FOR THE LIONS, THE BETTER
THEY PLAY.
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE BACKED UP
INSIDE THE 5 AND I'VE SAID IT,
YOU JUST TRY TO GET A NEW SET OF
DOWNS AND NEXT THING THEY'RE
INSIDE THE 10 YARD LINE LOOKING
FOR A TOUCHDOWN.
Joe: BOTH BACKS IN THERE.
GOFF, LaPORTA, GOOD TACKLE.
THAT PLAY MADE BY KEYON MARTIN,
WHO IS A ROOKIE, AND A TRYOUT
PLAYER THAT JUST OPENED THEIR
EYES, FORCED HIS WAY ONTO THE
TEAM AND MADE A NICE TACKLE
THERE.
IT'S THIRD DOWN AND FOUR.
Troy: WELL, THIS HAS BEEN ONE
HECK OF A BALL GAME.
IT'S A HEAVYWEIGHT FIGHT FOR
WEEK THREE, AND WE TALKED ABOUT
IT BEING A MEASURING STICK TO
SEE WHERE THESE TEAMS WERE AFTER
SOME DISAPPOINTING WEEK ONE
LOSSES AND THEY JUST CONTINUE TO
EXCHANGE BLOWS.
Joe: THIRD DOWN AND FOUR.
PLAY CLOCK IS AT 5.
TIME-OUT TAKEN BY DAN CAMPBELL,
WHO WAS SAUNTERING DOWN BELIEVE IN YOU. FOR YOUR
INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL NEEDS.
NATIONWIDE IS ON YOUR SIDE.
Joe: PLAY CLOCK WAS EXPIRING
SO DAN CAMPBELL HAD TO USE HIS
FIRST TIME-OUT OF THE HALF.
90 YARDS OVER FIVE PLAY, THE
72-YARD RUN BY MONTGOMERY AND
NOW IT'S THIRD AND FOUR.
Troy: YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE
DAN CAMPBELL HAS TOLD JOHNNIE
MORTON HE HAS TWO DOWNS TO PICK
IT UP IF THEY DON'T GET IT ON
THIRD.
AS AGGRESSIVE AS DAN CAMPBELL TO
START THE GAME CAN'T IMAGINE HE
WOULDN'T BE HERE.
Joe: HERE'S GIBBS.
HIS KNEE WENT DOWN AND HE DIDN'T
GET IT.
IT'S GOING TO BE FOURTH DOWN AND
IF THE LIONS WANT TO LET THE
QUARTER EXPIRE AND PICK THIS UP
IN THE FOURTH, THEY CAN BUT
RIGHT NOW THEY'RE HURRYING BACK
TO THE LINE.
THEY DID NOT SUBSTITUTE.
THEY CAN GO RIGHT BACK UNDER
CENTER.
Troy: I WOULD THINK THEY'D
WANT TO TAKE IT TO THE 4.
Joe: AND THAT'S WHERE WE GO.
R, FOURTH
DOWN AND THE SEVENTH PLAY OF
THIS DRIVE, IT STARTED BACK AT
THE 4.
Troy: THIS IS WHEN IF YOU'RE
THE BALTIMORE RAVENS YOU SURE
WISH YOU HAD NNAMDI MADUBUIKE IN
THE LINEUP.
Joe: HE'S OUT WITH A BAD
NECK.
THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG HE
WILL BE OUT.
TWO PRO BOWLERS NOT OUT THERE
FOR THE RAVENS, FOURTH AND ONE.
THEY PITCH TO GIBBS, TOUCHDOWN!
THEY WENT FROM GOFF TO AMON-RA
ST. BROWN AND HE PITCHED IT TO
GIBBS, AND LIKE BEN JOHNSON
WOULD CALL.
Troy: YEAH.
Joe: IT WAS A GADGET PLAY AND
BOY, WAS THAT A THING OF BEAUTY.
Troy: WE'VE SEEN JOHNNIE
MORTON DIAL UP A COUPLE OF THESE
TONIGHT.
GOOD EXECUTION.
THEY GET IT TO ST. BROWN THEN HE
PITCHES IT OUT TO JAHMYR GIBBS
TO GET HIM ON THE EDGE WITH THE
SPEED.
THERE'S A GOOD LOOK AT JOHNNIE
MORTON.
HE HAD A HECK OF A GAME PLAN
LAST WEEK IN THAT BIG WIN
AGAINST CHICAGO AND TONIGHT HERE
ON THE ROAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS
WERE GOING TO BE ANSWERED, AND
IF THERE WERE ANY OUT THERE ON
HIM, HE'S ANSWERED THOSE AS
WELL.
Joe: UP BY SEVEN.
BEFORE TONIGHT THE LAST TIME THE
RAVENS ALLOWED A 95-YARD
TOUCHDOWN IN BALTIMORE WAS IN
2001.
THE LIONS HAVE DONE IT TWICE
TONIGHT.
AMAZING.
72-YARD RUN BY DAVID MONTGOMERY
GOT THEM DOWN THERE.
LONGEST RUN IN THE NFL THIS
SEASON.
WHAT A GAME.
GIBBS HAS GOT ANOTHER AND THE
LIONS BACK UP  GET TWO MONTHS FREE WITH
CODE TV.
OH YEAH.
Troy: TAKE A LOOK AT THIS
HANDOFF HERE BY JARED GOFF.
AS HE GIVES IT TO AMON-RA ST.
BROWN, IT'S VERTICAL AND THE
REASON FOR THAT IS THEN HE'S
ABLE TO JUST PITCH IT.
IT'S ALREADY IN A POSITION THAT
HE NEEDS IT TO BE IN TO PITCH IT
QUICKLY, THEY'RE WORKING OFF
MIKE GREEN BUT THAT'S JUST
DETAIL IN THE EXECUTION AND IT'S
AN EXCELLENT JOB BY JOHN MORTON
WHEN HE PUT THAT PLAY IN AND
HAVING ALL THE FINER POINTS OF
IT DETAILED OUT.
Joe: RASHEEN ALI RETURNED IT,
AND THEN GOT TACKLED UP HIGH ON
THE SIDELINE.
NO FLAG AND IT'S RAVENS BALL
DOWN SEVEN AS ROCK YA-SIN MADE
THAT STOP AND HERE'S THE RAVENS
OFFENSE BACK OUT THERE BACK DOWN
BY SEVEN POINTS.
Troy: NOW IT'S THE RAVENS'
OPPORTUNITY TO SEE IF THEY CAN
MATCH THE BLOW THEY JUST TOOK.
JUST ANOTHER GREAT DRIVE.
JOHN MORTON HAS REALLY DONE AN
EXCELLENT JOB.
A GUY WHO WAS PICKED,
ANTICIPATING HE MIGHT LOSE BEN
JOHNSON.
HE WAS ALWAYS THE GUY THAT DAN
CAMPBELL HAD IN MIND.
Joe: JACKSON BREAKING
TACKLES, ANZALONE WON'T LET HIM
GO, ANZALONE IS CELEBRATING HIS
31st BIRTHDAY TODAY, TRYING TO
HELP GET A WIN HERE TO GET THEIR
RECORD TO 2-1.
BEEN A GOOD PLAYER FOR A LONG
TIME IN HIS NINTH YEAR.
SECOND DOWN AND SEVEN.
Troy: I THINK THESE
LINEBACKERS FOR DETROIT ARE
REALLY GOOD, AND WE'VE SEEN A
LOT OF BARNES TONIGHT, BECAUSE
THE LIONS HAVE PLAYED A LOT OF
BASE DEFENSE MATCHING THE
PERSONNEL THAT THEY'VE GOTTEN
FROM THE BALTIMORE RAVENS.
Joe: SECOND AND SEVEN,
JACKSON OUT TO HIS RIGHT, THROWS
IT AWAY.
WAS TOO HIGH FOR FLOWERS.
THAT ONE GOT AWAY.
FLOWERS WAS OPEN.
THIRD DOWN AND SEVEN.
Troy: THIRD DOWN AND SEVEN
AND, YOU KNOW, BALTIMORE HASN'T
HAD NEAR AS MANY OF THEM.
SEVEN THIRD DOWNS TONIGHT AND
CONVERTED FOUR OF THEM BUT NOW
WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO CONVERT
THEIR FIFTH.
Joe: KELVIN SHEPPARD, FIRST
YEAR DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR.
PLAYED FOR THE LIONS, WAS AN
EIGHT-YEAR LINEBACKER IN THE
LEAGUE.
THIRD DOWN, SEVEN YARDS.
JACKSON OVER THE MIDDLE.
HE'S GOT BATEMAN, FIRST DOWN.
PERFECT FLOW,
PERFECT THROW, 19 YARDS AND INTO
LIONS TERRITORY GO THE RAVENS.
Troy: TYLAN WALLACE, NUMBER
16 GOES THROUGH THE DEFENSE AND
CLEARS OUT A DEFENDER AND JUST
OPENS IT UP.
WATCH TYLAN WALLACE AND THE
IMPACT THAT HE THEN LAST ON
BRANCH AT THE SAFETY AND THEN
THAT OPENS IT UP IN BEHIND FOR
BATEMAN TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE
PLAY.
IT'S A GOOD DESIGN AND EXCELLENT
JOB BY LAMAR JACKSON JUST
READING IT OUT.
Joe: TOSS TO HENRY.
AND A PRETTY GOOD TACKLE BY JACK
CAMPBELL.
THERE'S A FLAG DOWN OUT ON THE
EDGE.
CAMPBELL'S BEEN DEALING WITH A
BLOODY MOUTH MOST OF THE NIGHT.
Referee: DEFENSE, NUMBER 32.
15-YARD PENALTY, FIRST DOWN.
Joe: IT'S AGAINST BRIAN
BRANCH.
Troy: HERE HE IS RIGHT HERE
IN THE -- YOUR SCREEN.
YOU CAN'T -- YEAH, I DON'T
KNOW -- I DON'T KNOW.
I'LL LEAVE THAT TO YOU, RUSSELL.
Russell: I DON'T SEE A
PENALTY THERE.
I THINK HE INITIATED CONTACT.
I DON'T LIKE THAT AS A FOUL.
Joe: THAT'S A BIG CALL THAT
TAKES THE BALL INSIDE THE
DETROIT 32.
IT'S HOT.
THAT'LL MAK
Joe: THAT'LL MAKE IT FIRST
AND 15 AS KOLAR JUMPED.
Referee: OFFENSE, NUMBER 88.
FIVE-YARD PENALTY, STILL FIRST
DOWN.
Joe: LET'S GO DOWN TO LAURA.
LAURA
Laura: YOU POINTED OUT THE
BANDAGE ON JACK CAMPBELL'S LIP.
HE HAD A SPLIT CUT ON HIS LIP.
THEY WORKED ON IT FOR AWHILE.
CREDIT TO GET THE BLEEDING TO
STOP.
THEY ADDED A FACE SHIELD TO HIS
HELMET AND THIS IS THE HIT WHERE
IT HAPPENED.
HE'S BEEN DEALING WITH A LOT OF
PAIN AND BLOOD ON THE SIDELINE.
Joe: IT WAS A HIT FROM
JUSTICE HILL PLAYING THROUGH IT,
FIRST DOWN AND 15.
Troy: THEY GOT MAN COVERAGE
ACROSS THE BOARD.
Joe: PASS IS UNDERTHROWN.
JACKSON WAS UNDER PRESSURE AND
HOPKINS WAS THE TARGET.
AS TYLER LACY HAD PRESSURE ON
LAMAR JACKSON.
HE WAS PICKED UP OFF WAIVERS
FROM THE JAGUARS.
Troy: YEAH, THE LIONS ARE
GOING TO COME AFTER YOU AND YOU
CAN TELL BY THE WAY THEY WERE
POSITIONED WITH THE DEFENSIVE
BACKS THAT THEY WERE LOCKED UP
IN MAN COVERAGE AND HERE THEY
WERE COMING AND SO A GOOD JOB BY
THEM, FORCE THE BALL OUT OF
LAMAR JACKSON'S HANDS AND SEE IF
THEY CAN'T COVER FOR THE TIME
THAT IT TAKES FOR HIM TO GET IT
OUT AND MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.
Joe: JACKSON, WIDE OPEN.
FIRST DOWN, RAVENS.
BATEMAN AGAIN.
AND 16 YARDS FROM LAMAR JACKSON.
Troy: WELL, AGAIN, THEY'RE
TRYING TO DISGUISE, THEY'LL SHOW
THEY'RE ALL COMING UP HERE AND
YOU GOT BRIAN BRANCH WHO IS
GOING TO RUN TO A TWO DEEP LOOK,
AND AS HE'S RUNNING OUT OF THERE
IT OPENS UP.
YOU SEE JUST HOW MUCH SPACE
THERE IS THEN FOR THESE
RECEIVERS, AND BATEMAN JUST SITS
RIGHT DOWN IN THE HOLE AND NICE
COMPLETION.
Joe: JACKSON WANTED TO TAKE
OFF.
AND HE IS BROUGHT TO THE GROUND
AND A GOOD PLAY BY DJ READER.
DEALT WITH A QUAD INJURY.
THEY WOULD LOVE TO SEE DJ READER
GET BACK TO THE BENGALS DJ
READER THEY SIGNED AS AN
UNRESTRICTED FREE AGENT AND
HEALTH WILL MAYBE GET HIM THERE.
Troy: THEY'RE RELYING ON A
LOT OF GUYS ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR
WITH MARCUS DAVENPORT GOING DOWN
AGAIN AND THEY HAD LOOKED AT
MAYBE BRINGING IN ANOTHER EDGE
RUSHER, BUT FELT THE DEPTH WAS
MORE IMPORTANT WITH ALL THE
INJURIES THEY WENT THROUGH LAST
YEAR.
Joe: SECOND DOWN AND NINE
NOW.
JACKSON, ONE-ON-ONE AND THAT
LITTLE BATTLE WAS WON BY
NOWASKE.
THEY BLEW IT DEAD.
NOT A FUMBLE AND TREVOR NOWASKE
DIDN'T FLINCH AND BROUGHT HIM
DOWN.
Troy: HE DID NOT.
HE HUNG IN THERE AND WAS ABLE TO
MAKE A GOOD TACKLE.
NOT MANY GUYS ARE ABLE TO DO
THAT ON LAMAR JACKSON.
Joe: YOU SEE, HE'S KIND OF IN
A SPYTEK SNEAK AND AS LAMAR
STARTS TO TRY TO SCRAMBLE UP IN
THE LINE, BOY, HE WAS RIGHT
THERE TO MAKE A PLAY.
Joe: AND A LOSS OF FOUR.
THAT'S THE FOURTH LIONS SACK AND
FOR NOWASKE HIS FIRST OF THE
YEAR AND IT'S THIRD AND 13.
Joe: JACKSON TRYING TO FIND
SOMEWHERE TO GO.
TIME RUNS OUT.
AND TRIPPED UP BY BARNES.
AND LAMAR JACKSON WAS ONE GUY
AWAY FROM GETTING OUT OF THERE
AND DERRICK BARNES SAVED THE DAY
FOR DETROIT.
KELVIN SHEPPARD LOVING EVERY
SECOND OF IT.
Troy: AND DERRICK BARNES
INITIALLY GOES TO COVERAGE.
HE GOES OUT AND HE'S JUST KIND
OF WATCHING WITH HIS EYES.
HE'S WAITING FOR SOMEBODY TO
COME IN HIGGS AREA.
A FOUR-MAN RUSH.
WHEN HE SEES LAMAR START TO
MOVE, HE COMES IN AND MAKES A
PLAY AND IF HE DOESN'T DO THAT
INSTINCTIVE ON HIS PART THERE
WAS NOBODY OUT IN FRONT OF
LAMAR.
Joe: SACK NUMBER FIVE TONIGHT
FOR THE LIONS DEFENSE.
A 41-YARD TRY BY TYLER LOOP.
HE GOT IT.
LOOKED LIKE IT WENT OVER THE TOP
OF THE UPRIGHT.
AND THE FIELD GOAL IS GOOD.
THAT WAS CLOSE.
28-24.
LOOP PUTS HIS FOOT INTO IT.
AND IT'S A FOUR-POINT GAME IN
BALTIMORE.
INSIDE THE OUTSIDE EDGE.
IT'S HARD TO TELL FOR SURE.
THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT REVIEWABLE.
Joe: SO THE FIELD GOAL WAS
GOOD.
AND THIS IS A FOUR-POINT GAME
WITH THE LIONS ABOUT TO GET IT
BACK WITH UNDER TEN TO GO.
RETURNED BY SAYLORS.
BENDS IT BACK AND GETS OUT TO
THE 35.
IF YOU'RE DESIGNING SUCCESS,
IT'S BROUGHT TO YOU BY KFC AND A
LOOK AT THE GROUND GAME AND THE
LIONS IN THIS ONE.
Troy: THE MOST IMPRESSIVE
THING IS THAT JOHN MORTON HAS
STUCK WITH IT AND SOME OF THESE
RUNS AND THEY START TO BREAK BUT
WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING AGAINST THE
RAVENS, WHAT YOU GOT TO DO, THIS
OFFENSIVE LINE I THINK HAS DONE
A GOOD JOB.
HERE'S THE BIG 72-YARDER BY
DAVID MONTGOMERY AND THEN THE
TOUCHDOWN WITH THE TRICKERY,
SECOND ONE THAT WE SAW IN THIS
GAME, BOTH OF THEM SUCCESSFUL.
JUST THINK THE JOB THAT JOHN
MORTON IS THE PLAY CALLER
STICKING WITH IT, 29 RUNS, 23
PASSES, AGAINST THIS DEFENSE, HE
PLAYED THE GAME YOU GOT TO PLAY.
Joe: LIONS ARE OVERSEVEN
YARDS PER RUSH AND, TROY, AS YOU
SAID, THAT 72-YARDER BY
MONTGOMERY INFLATES THOSE
NUMBERS BUT STILL THE IMPRESSIVE
THING IS THAT JOHN MORTON IS
STUCK WITH IT EVEN WHEN AT TIMES
IT LOOKED LIKE THIS WASN'T MUCH
ROOM IN THERE AS GIBBS GETS BY.
Troy: WHAT ALLOWS YOU TO DO
THAT?
CONVERTING THEN ON THIRD DOWN,
AND DETROIT HAS BEEN REALLY GOOD
ON THIRD DOWN TONIGHT, SO THEN
THEY GET A NEW SET OF DOWNS THEN
THEY'RE ABLE TO RUN THE FOOTBALL
A COUPLE OF TIMES MORE, SO
THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO LEAN ON
THAT A LITTLE BIT AND KIND OF
TAKE THE FIGHT TO THIS RAVENS
DEFENSE.
Joe: PLAY ACTION HERE AS GOFF
LETS IT GO AND WHAT A GOOD PLAY.
TeSLAA WAS THE TARGET AND NATE
WIGGINS GOT HIS HAND IN THERE
AND KNOCKED IT AWAY.
GOOD EFFORT.
THIRD DOWN.
Troy: ROQUAN SMITH, HE'S THE
ONE WHO BLITZES AND GETS IN THE
FACE OF JARED GOFF, HE COMES A
LITTLE LATE.
BUT THERE'S THE ONE-ON-ONE
MATCHUP AND WIGGINS DOES AN
EXCELLENT JOB IN COVERAGE,
LOCKED UP MAN-TO-MAN HERE'S
ANOTHER LOOK AT ROQUAN SMITH,
BUT THEY KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE.
BIG THIRD DOWN HERE.
Joe: THIRD DOWN AND FIVE.
PLAY CLOCK IS AT ZERO AND THAT'S
A FLAG.
NOW THE OFFICIAL IS RUNNING IN.
HOLD ON A SECOND.
MAYBE THE SIDELINE GOT THE
TIME-OUT CALLED.
Referee: PRIOR TO THE PLAY
CLOCK EXPIRING DETROIT CALLED
THE SECOND CHARGED TIME-OUT.
Joe: SO THEY'LL PICK UP THE
FLAGS AND IT WAS DAN CAMPBELL ON
THE SIDELINE THAT CALLED IT.
BUT THE PLAY CLOCK JUST ABOUT TO
HIT ZERO.
Troy: IT'S A GREAT JOB BY DAN
CAMPBELL JUST, YOU KNOW, PAYING
ATTENTION AND THEN BEING QUICK
TO CALL THE TIME-OUT.
I WOULD HAVE -- I'VE NEVER BEEN
A HEAD COACH THAT HAD TO DO IT
BUT HERE YOU ARE TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT IS HE GOING TO GET
THE BALL OFF?
IS HE NOT GOING TO GET THE BALL
OFF AND YOU'RE TRYING TO DECIDE
THAT AS THE HEAD COACH AND HE
DOES IT JUST IN TIME.
TRYING TO GET IT SNAPPED BUT
EVERYONE ELSE HAS THEIR HEAD
DOWN AND SEES THE PLAY CLOCK
GOING DOWN BUT A BIG THIRD DOWN
EVEN WITH 8:48 TO GO, IF THE
LIONS CONVERT HERE, THERE'S A
GOOD CHANCE THEY'RE COMING AWAY
WITH POINTS.
IF THEY CAN COME AWAY WITH A
TOUCHDOWN ON THIS DRIVE THEY GOT
A CHANCE TO PUT A BOW ON THIS
ONE.
Joe: QUICK SNAP, GOFF STEPS
THROUGH, THROWS, INCOMPLETE,
FOURTH DOWN.
IT WAS SOME ROOM IN FRONT OF
JARED GOFF BUT HE CUT IT LOOSE
INSTEAD OF TRYING TO PICK IT UP
WITH HIS LEGS.
Troy: YEAH, HE HAD HIM TOO.
IF HE -- THE DECISION WASN'T SO
BAD, HE JUST WASN'T ABLE TO
DELIVER THE CATCHABLE BALL.
NOW, WHETHER OR NOT HE COULD
HAVE PICKED IT UP WITH HIS LEGS,
HE DIDN'T FEEL THAT HE COULD
HAVE, WOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSE, BUT
HE DID HAVE HIS GUY, IF HE MAKES
A BETTER THROW FOR THE FIRST
DOWN.
Joe: RAYMOND WAS THE TARGET.
PASS TOO LOW AND NOW FOX HITS
IT, NICE CATCH BY WESTER, MAKES
A MOVE, AND ABLE TO GET ACROSS
THE 20.RECAP IS
BROUGHT TO YOU BY FIREBALL.
AND IT WAS THAT SECOND QUARTER
GOAL LINE STAND BY THIS LIONS
DEFENSE.
THAT'S THE FOURTH DOWN PLAY
WHERE THE BALL GOT KNOCKED OUT
OF THE HAND OF LAMAR JACKSON BY
JACK CAMPBELL.
AND THIS DEFENSE LAST TIME THE
RAVENS HAD IT CAME UP WITH TWO
SACKS AND THEY HAVE FIVE SACKS
TONIGHT.
THIS DRIVE STARTS AT THE 21 DOWN
BY FOUR.
HANDOFF TO HENRY AND HE GETS IT
PUNCHED OUT.
IT'S RECOVERED BY D.J. REED.
KNOCKED OUT ON THE PLAY BY AIDAN
HUTCHINSON.
AND IT'S YET ANOTHER FUMBLE FOR
DERRICK HENRY.
HUTCHINSON KNOCKED IT OUT.
AND THAT'S ONE FUMBLE PER GAME
BY DERRICK HENRY AND IT WAS
AIDAN HUTCHINSON RIGHT THERE
THAT KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE LEFT
ARM OF DERRICK HENRY.
Troy: HE WAS UP THE FIELD.
HE WAS TAKING CARE OF LAMAR
JACKSON AND SO AS HE GETS UP THE
FEEL BUT HE CONTINUES TO PLAY SO
HE WORKS BACK, PURE EFFORT, ONCE
HE PEELS BACK, HENRY DOESN'T
KNOW HE'S PURSUING THE FOOTBALL
AND THEN IS ABLE TO PUNCH IT
OUT.
Joe: IT WAS A CRUSHING FUMBLE
THAT HE HAD IN WEEK ONE AT
BUFFALO.
THEY GOT THROUGH IT LAST WEEK.
AND THIS ONE, HOW MUCH IS THIS
GOING TO HURT AS THEY HAND TO
MONTGOMERY?
WITH UNDER 8:30 TO GO.
HERE'S THE WEEK ONE FUMBLE IN
THAT GAME AT THE BILLS.
IT WAS PUNCHED OUT.
THEY BLEW A FOURTH QUARTER LEAD
WITH FOUR MINUTES TO PLAY AND
LOST THAT BALL GAME, 41-40 AND
NOW HERE TONIGHT, HUTCHINSON
KNOCKS IT OUT OF HIS LEFT ARM
AND D.J. REED RECOVERS.
Troy: GREAT JOB BY HUTCHINSON
JUST CONTINUING TO PLAY EVEN
THOUGH IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS OUT
OF THE PLAY, JUST PURE EFFORT.
Joe: MONTGOMERY RIGHT UP THE
GUT, DOWN TO THE 5 AND A FLAG
COMES IN AT THE END OF THE PLAY.
Troy: RAVENS ARE SENATING IT
WILL GO ON DETROIT WITH A HOLD.
Joe: IT IS, GOING AGAINST
DETROIT.
THAT WAS THE INDICATION.
Referee: PERSONAL FOUL.
FACE MASK, OFFENSE, NUMBER 73,
15-YARD PENALTY, REPEAT SECOND
DOWN.
Joe: THEY GET CHRISTIAN
MAHOGANY, THE SECOND YEAR PRO
FROM BOSTON COLLEGE AND BRENT
URBAN IS THE ONE WHO HAD HIS
FACE MASK GRABBED BY MAHOGANY.
FRIDAY RIGHT HERE.
AND INSTEAD OF FIRST AND GOAL
THE BALL AT THE 5, THAT 15-YARD
PENALTY TAKES THE BALL BACK OUT
TO THE 28.
Troy: THAT CERTAINLY HELPS.
TAKE A LOOK HERE AT DERRICK
HENRY WITH THE FUMBLES THAT HAVE
PLAGUED HIM THIS YEAR, BUT THIS
DEFENSE, THEY'VE GOT TO BE ABLE
TO MAKE A STOP.
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO MAKE
A STOP IN THE RED ZONE TONIGHT,
BUT THAT PENALTY SURE HELPS.
Joe: SECOND AND 22 AS A
RESULT.
THEY HAND TO GIBBS.
NOT MUCH.
LET'S GO ACK TO THAT FUMBLE
FORCED BY AIDAN HUTCHINSON ON
THE CARRY BY HENRY.
Troy: YOU SEE, HE'S WORRIED
ABOUT LAMAR JACKSON AND HE COMES
UP THE FIELD AND HE JUST
CONTINUES TO PLAY AND IN BIG
GAMES LIKE THIS YOU NEED YOUR
GREAT PLAYERS TO SHOW UP BIG AND
HE CERTAINLY DID.
NOW, CAN THE RAVENS DEFENSIVELY
DO THEIR PART TO KEEP THIS A
ONE-POSSESSION GAME?
Joe: THIRD DOWN AND 21.
THIS ONE FLOATED FOR TeSLAA,
INCOMPLETE, FOURTH DOWN AND ONE
OTHER NOTE ON THE FUMBLES BY
HENRY, IT'S THE FIRST TIME IN
HIS TEN-YEAR CAREER HE'S HAD
MULTIPLE FOURTH QUARTER FUMBLES
LOST IN THE SAME SEASON AND
WE'RE JUST IN WEEK THREE.
Troy: WELL, I THINK IF YOU
LOOK AT IT OR DERRICK HENRY,
HE'S GOT TO GET THAT OUT OF HIS
MIND AS QUICKLY AS HE CAN
BECAUSE THEY'LL NEED HIM ON THIS
NEXT POSSESSION.
AFTER THE OPENING DRIVE HE
REALLY HASN'T DONE ANYTHING.
THE REST OF THE NIGHT AS FAR AS
ON THE GROUND.
Joe: 45-YARD TRY TO MAKE IT A
SEVEN-POINT GAME AGAIN BY BATES.
AND HE DRILLS IT.
31-24.
AND HENRY AS TROY SAID IS GOING
TO HAVE TO GO BACK TO WORK AND
FORGET ABOUT THE FUMBLES.
HE FRUSTRATED.
WE SAW THIS IN BUFFALO AND WE
SEE IT TONIGHT HERE AT HOME.
SEVEN-POINT GAME.. DOLPHINS ON ESPN.
BENGALS. BRONCOS ON ABC.
Joe: EARLIER D.J. REED
RECOVERS THE FUMBLE THAT WAS
FORCED BY AIDAN HUTCHINSON AND
THEY WERE READY.
Troy: HE LOOKED LIKE OUR
PRODUCER STEVE ROLLING THAT
BALL.
Joe: ABSOLUTELY.
Troy: BOWLING THAT NIGHT.
Joe: HE IS TALENTED.
Troy: HE IS A TALENT.
Joe: HE'S OUR PRODUCER AND
ARTIE OUR DIRECTOR WITH LISA
SALTERS AND LAURA RUTLEDGE DOWN
ON THE FIELD.
TROY AND JOE UP IN THE BOOTH AND
6:30 TO GO.
RASHEEN ALI TO RETURN ANOTHER
KICK, AND HE'S BACK THERE WITH
JUSTICE HILL.
Troy: THE DEFENSE DID THEIR
PART.
THEY'VE GIVEN UP BIG DRIVES,
LONG DRIVES FOR TOUCHDOWNS, BUT,
MAN, THEY NEEDED HIM ON THAT
LAST ONE AND THEY SHOWED UP.
Joe: IT'S ALI FROM ABOUT THE
10.
TO THE 31.
AIDAN HUTCHINSON ANY TIME HE'S
INVOLVED IN THE GAME, CAMERAS
ARE ON HIM AS WE LOOK AT HIS
EFFORT AND HIS EVENING TONIGHT.
Troy: WELL, WE HEARD LAURA
EARLIER TALK ABOUT HOW HE'S GOT
THE GREEN LIGHT.
HE CAN LINE UP WHERE HE WANTS
AND KIND OF DO WHAT HE WANTS AND
WITH THAT FLEXIBILITY WE'VE SEEN
HIM TONIGHT LINE UP ON BOTH
SIDES.
HE TYPICALLY WOULD LINE UP ON
THE DEFENSIVE LEFT AGAINST THE
OFFENSIVE RIGHT TACKLE.
THIS YEAR HE'S MIXING IT UP A
LITTLE BIT MORE, BUT AS ALL
GREAT PLAYERS DO, THEY SHOW UP
AND MAKE BIG PLAYS WHEN THEY
NEED IT.
AND HE DID ON THAT LAST DRIVE.
Joe: LAMAR JACKSON, THERE HE
IS.
HUTCHINSON, SACK NUMBER SIX.
FOR THE LIONS.
THE FAMILY LOVES IT.
MOM AND DAD LOVE IT AND A LOSS
OF SIX ON THE PLAY.
Troy: THIS TIME HE TAKES AN
INSIDE MOVE AND YOU'LL SEE
RONNIE STANLEY, THE LEFT TACKLE
AS HE SLIDES OUT, THEY'RE MOVING
PROTECTION THAT WAY TO TRY TO
TAKE CARE OF HIM.
AND YET HE TAKES AN INSIDE
COUNTER MOVE AND THEN HAS A
STRAIGHT SHOT ON LAMAR.
Joe: NOW SECOND DOWN AND 16.
HERE'S HILL.
TERRION ARNOLD, FIRST TO GET TO
HIM.
THIRD DOWN COMING UP.
A GAIN OF FOUR.
YESTERDAY THE NFC NORTH WATCHED
GREEN BAY SUFFER THEIR FIRST
LOSS OF THE YEAR AS THEY BLEW
THAT LATE LEAD AND LOST TO THE
CLEVELAND BROWNS.
SO, THEY GO TO 2-1.
LIONS TRYING TO GET TO 2-1.
SAME STORY FOR THE RAVENS,
SEVEN-POINT GAME, THIRD DOWN AND
12.
JACKSON CAN'T FIND ANYWHERE TO
GO AND HE'S BROUGHT DOWN AGAIN
FROM BEHIND AND AGAIN IT'S
AL-QUADIN MUHAMMAD.
IT'LL GO DOWN AS A RUN.
IT'S NOT A SACK BUT IT IS AN
EFFECTIVE PLAY BY 96 AGAIN.
Troy: YEAH, NO DOUBT, JOE.
THE EFFORT THAT HE HAS SHOWN, I
POINTED IT OUT A LITTLE EARLIER.
THIS IS WHAT THE COACHES LIKE SO
MUCH ABOUT HIM COMING OFFER THE
BALL AS HE COMES UP THE FIELD
HERE AND THEN HE JUST CONTINUES
TO PLAY, ANZALONE MISSES HIM BUT
YET HE'S THERE TO CLEAN IT UP.
Joe: STOUT HITS IT.
RAYMOND WAITING FOR IT AS IT
HEADS OUT OF BOUNDS.
KELVIN SHEPPARD HAS DONE SOME
JOB.
LOOK HOW FAR THIS BALL WENT OUT
OF BOUNDS UP AT THE 30.
THAT'S WHERE THEY'LL MARK IT.
JUST A 38-YARD PUNT AND HERE IS
AL-QUADIN MUHAMMAD NOT QUITTING
ON THE PLAY AND KELVIN SHEPPARD
TOLD US, AL-QUADIN MUHAMMAD IS
GOING TO BE OKAY IS KIND OF THE
LAST MAN STANDING ACROSS FROM
AIDAN HUTCHINSON TO RUSH IN.
Troy: YEAH, THEY LIKE HIM AND
I LIKE KELVIN SHEPPARD AND WHAT
HE HAS BROUGHT, YOU KNOW, HE'S
CONTINUED TO PLAY THE STYLE AND
I'M NOT SURPRISED.
DAN CAMPBELL KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS
THIS TEAM TO BE.
HE FELT KELVIN SHEPPARD WAS THE
GUY TO NAME HIM AS DEFENSIVE
COORDINATOR AND THEY CONTINUE TO
PLAY THIS AGGRESSIVE STYLE AND
TAKE IT TO THESE OFFENSES AND
THE DEFENSES RESPONDED TO HIM.
Joe: HERE'S GREEN CRASHING
DOWN ON IT, GIBBS RUNS AWAY FROM
HIM.
AND HE IS OUT OF BOUNDS BUT A
NICE GAIN ON FIRST DOWN.
MAYBE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE ON
KELVIN SHEPPARD WHO AS I
MENTIONED EARLIER HAD AN
EIGHT-YEAR PLAYING CAREER AS A
LINEBACKER.
HE'S BEEN THE LINEBACKERS COACH
WITH THIS TEAM SINCE 2022,
PLAYED FOR BUFFALO, MIAMI,
INDIANAPOLIS, DETROIT, NEVER
THOUGHT HE WOULD BE A COACH.
BUT NOW THAT HE'S IN IT, HE
LOVES IT.
Troy: YEAH, DAN CAMPBELL SAID
WHEN HE WAS WITH HIM IN MIAMI HE
ALWAYS KNEW HE'D MAKE A GREAT
COACH WHEN HE WAS STILL A
PLAYER.
Joe: HERE'S A STRONG RUN FOR
A FIRST DOWN BY GIBBS.
AND THE GOOD TEAMS AND YOU
CERTAINLY WERE ON ONE OF THEM
THAT COULD DO WHAT THE LIONS ARE
TRYING TO DO, SALT AWAY A LEAD,
RUN THE BALL, RUN THE CLOCK DOWN
AND WHEN YOU KNOW THE RUNS ARE
COMING AND CAN'T STOP IT, THAT
MEANS THAT THIS YOUNG OFFENSIVE
LINE IS DOING A GOOD JOB FOR THE
LIONS.
Troy: YES, THAT'S TRUE, AND I
WAS GOING TO SAY, JOE, IT'S
HARDER AND HARDER FOR TEAMS TO
DO THAT.
IT'S NEVER BEEN EASY, BUT IT'S
BECOME INCREASINGLY HARDER AS
WE'VE GONE MORE TO THESE SPREAD
OFFENSE, TEAMS HAVE RELIED MORE
THAT IT'S HARD TO RUN THE
FOOTBALL WHEN THE DEFENSE KNOWS
YOU'RE GOING TO, BUT THE LIONS,
AS DAN CAMPBELL OFTEN SAYS,
THEY'RE BUILT FOR THIS.
Joe: GIBBS, WELL PLAYED BY
THE RAVENS' DEFENSE, A GAIN OF
TWO.
YOU KNOW, WE TALKED ABOUT THE
YOUNG GUARDS THAT THE LIONS
HAVE, THEY HAVE THE TEN-YEAR VET
GLASGOW AT CENTER AND THEN TWO
OUTSTANDING TACKLES, PENEI
SEWELL WHO IS ONE OF THE BEST
PLAYERS IN THE LEAGUE, THAT'S
HIM IN THE MIDDLE, 58 AND TAYLOR
DECKER WHO IS PLAYING THROUGH A
BAD SHOULDER, 68 OUT AT LEFT
TACKLE.
Troy: AND LAST YEAR AND
REALLY FOR THE LAST SEVERAL
YEARS THEY'VE BEEN SO STRONG AND
THIS TEAM, I DON'T THINK IT'S A
STRETCH TO SAY THEY'RE GOING TO
GO AS FAR AS THOSE YOUNG GUARDS
ALLOW THEM TO GO BECAUSE THEY'RE
PRETTY SOLID EVERYWHERE ELSE.
BUT THEY'VE HAD A GOOD SHOWING
TONIGHT.
Joe: SECOND AND 8 AND HAND TO
MONTGOMERY.
THIRD DOWN COMING UP.
THE LIONS HAVE A DATE WITH THE
BROWNS NEXT.
I MENTIONED BROWNS JUST BEAT
GREEN BAY THEN THEY'RE AT
CINCINNATI, THE JOE BURROWLESS
BENGALS AT KANSAS CITY AND THEN
BACK ON MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL
BEFORE THEIR BYE WEEK AGAINST
THE TAMPA BAY BUCS.
Troy: DAN CAMPBELL IS LOOKING
AT THIS.
THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO TAKE IT TO
THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
IT'S JUST A SPLIT SECOND OFF.
Joe: THIRD DOWN AND FIVE AND
BECAUSE OF THAT, THEY CAN THROW
A PASS.
SAFE. THE
NATIONWIDE POSTGAME, WE WILL
VISIT WITH ONE OF THE STARS OF
THE GAME HERE FROM BOTH
QUARTERBACKS.
COACHES GO INSIDE THE WINNING
LOCKER ROOM AS WELL AND LOOK
FORWARD TO TALKING ABOUT THIS
FANTASTIC GAME WITH YOU AND
TROY.
JOE, BACK TO YOU.
FOURTH AND TWO.
YEP.
YEAH.
AND FOURTH AND TWO.
AND THE LIONS TROY LOOK LIKE
THEYRE GOING TO GO FOR IT.
THEYRE TWO FOR TWO ON FOURTH
DOWN TRIES IN THIS GAME.
YEAH.
MAYBE THEY TRY TO HARD COUNT
DRAW THEM OFFSIDES BUT DIDNT
APPEAR TO BE ANY HESITATION FROM
DAN CAMPBELL.
NOT SURPRISED.
HES GOT BIG ONIONS I MEAN THIS
IS THIS IS A BOLD MOVE.
EVEN WITH A FIRST DOWN.
THEY CANNOT RUN OUT THE CLOCK
BECAUSE THE RAVENS STILL HAVE
ALL THREE TIME OUTS.
Joe: MONTGOMERY IN THE
BACKFIELD ON FOURTH AND TWO.
GOFF KEEPS, FLOATS, AMON-RA ST.
BROWN, THROW AND CATCH.
UNREAL.
BUT A FLAG IS DOWN BACK AT THE
50.
HERE'S THE CALL.
Referee: HOLDING, DEFENSE,
NUMBER 44.
PENALTY IS DECLINED.
THE RESULT OF THE PLAY IS FIRST
DOWN.
Joe: TROY, HOW GOOD WAS THAT
THROW?
Troy: IT WAS THE BEST THROW
OF THE NIGHT.
THIS BALL HAD TO BE PERFECT.
MARLON HUMPHREY, NUMBER 44, IS
GOING TO BE THE ONE WHO GRABS
AND HE'S GOT HIS EYES IN THE
BACKFIELD.
HE'S JUST NOT ANTICIPATING THAT
ST. BROWN IS GOING TO GO OUT ON
THE ROUTE BUT THIS BALL, HE HAD
A STEP.
I'M WATCHING IT THE WHOLE WAY
BUT YOU GOT TO MAKE THIS THROW
AND THE GREAT ONES MAKE IT AND
JARED GOFF LAYS IT OUT THERE
PERFECTLY ON FOURTH DOWN.
THAT'S AS GOOD AS IT GETS.
Joe: 20 YARDS ON FOURTH DOWN
AND TWO.
3 FOR 3 GOING FOR IT ON FOURTH
DOWN.
THINK THESE GUYS HAVE ANY FUN
PLAYING FOR DAN CAMPBELL.
Troy:  MY GOSH, YEAH.
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO
DO.
I MEAN, IT'S NO SURPRISE.
JARED WILL BE ASKED ABOUT IT
AFTER THIS GAME.
HE'LL ANSWER IT.
THERE WAS NEVER A DOUBT THAT
THEY WERE GOING TO GO FOR IT ON
FOURTH -- IT'S WHAT THEY'RE USED
TO.
THE WAY THEY'RE BUILT.
Joe: NOW MONTGOMERY, HE IS
GOING TO BREAK.
DAVID MONTGOMERY IS IN FOR THE
TOUCHDOWN!
JUST A STUNNING, STUNNING COUPLE
OF PLAYS BACK-TO-BACK AND THE
DETROIT LIONS, IT APPEARS, ARE
GOING TO WALK OUT OF HERE WITH
THEIR SECOND WIN OF THE YEAR.
Troy: WE COME IN TALKING
ABOUT THESE YOUNG GUARDS.
MAHOGANY AND TATE RATLEDGE AND
THE JOB THAT THEY HAVE DONE
TONIGHT AND REALLY ALL FIVE OF
THOSE GUYS ALONG WITH THE
RECEIVERS, JAMESON WILLIAMS,
HE'S DOWN THE FIELD BLOCKING,
225 YARDS RUSHING TONIGHT FOR
THE DETROIT LIONS.
Joe: GOFF IS TELLING HIM TO
GO DOWN.
Troy: UNLESS HE CAN SCORE AND
THEN IT'S OKAY.
Joe: 31 YARDS AND THE LIONS'
RUSHING ATTACK IN THIS GAME,
FOUR RUSHING TOUCHDOWNS, 225
RUSH YARDS.
AND THIS IS A 14-POINT GAME.
AND THERE'S TAYLOR DECKER WITH A
HUG FOR DAVID MONTGOMERY.
GRAHAM GLASGOW, THE TEN-YEAR VET
AT CENTER.
BOY, THIS IS SOME IMPRESSIVE
NIGHT, HANK FRALEY, HIS NICKNAME
WAS HONEY BUNS WHEN HE PLAYED
FOR THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES.
WHAT A JOB HE HAS DONE WITH THIS
GROUP AND THE RUSH YARDS AND
WHEN THE LIONS NEEDED A PERFECT
THROW FROM OFFSIDES THEY GOT IT.
Troy: AS SOMEONE WHO WAS A
PART OF A GREAT OFFENSIVE LINE
AND GREAT RUNNING BACK AND BEING
ABLE TO DO WHAT THE LIONS HAVE
DONE TONIGHT AND ICE A GAME
THAT -- I KNOW HOW GOOD THAT
FEELS.
JAYDEN DANIELS DELIVERED
JARED GOFF DELIVERED THE PERFECT
THROW AND HANK FRALEY AND WHAT
HE'S DONE SINCE HE CAME TO
DETROIT AND THESE YOUNG GUYS AND
THEY'VE BEEN QUESTIONED ALL WEEK
LONG, EVEN AFTER THEIR
PERFORMANCE LAST WEEK AND TO
HAVE THE NIGHT THEY'VE HAD ON
THE ROAD IN A BIG GAME.
WE TALKED ABOUT IT BEING A
MEASURING STICK TONIGHT, I MEAN,
THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE HECK OF A
PLANE RIDE BACK TO DETROIT.
Joe: NO HEAD COACH GOES FOR
IT MORE ON FOURTH DOWN.
HE'S DONE IT THREE MORE TIMES
TONIGHT SINCE HE'S BEEN HEAD
COACH SINCE 2021.
ALI WILL TAKE A KNEE.
IT'LL COME OUT TO THE 35.
THINK ABOUT DAN CAMPBELL TAKING
OVER IN 2021.
THREE WINS HIS FIRST YEAR, NINE
HIS SECOND, 12 WINS, FRANCHISE
RECORD 15 LAST YEAR.
HE'S GOT THIS TEAM HUMMING AGAIN
HERE IN 2025.
THIS IS A BIG WIN HERE TONIGHT
IN BALTIMORE AFTER THAT LOSS AT
GREEN BAY, YES, THEY BEAT THE
BEARS, BUT THIS LAST A DIFFERENT
FEEL.
Troy: I AGREE AND THEY ALL
COUNT THE SAME.
YOU KNOW, THERE'S 17 OF THEM,
BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT FEEL A
LITTLE DIFFERENT.
AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE.
STILL 1:40.
THREE TIME-OUTS BUT A 14-POINT
GAME AS BATEMAN DOWNFIELD.
IT'S OUT OF HIS REACH.
TERRION ARNOLD WITH GOOD
COVERAGE THAT TIME FOR THE
LIONS.
LAMAR JACKSON'S NUMBERS, 18 OF
24.
210.
THOSE LONG DRIVES JUST KEPT HIM
OFF THE FIELD.
THEY HAD TWO DRIVES OF OVER 95
YARDS FOR TOUCHDOWNS TONIGHT.
THE LIONS DID.
Troy: YEAH, JUST 49 PLAYS
RIGHT NOW OFFENSIVELY FOR
BALTIMORE AND THEY HAD THEIR
OPPORTUNITIES, AND OFFENSIVELY
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FEEL GOOD
ABOUT WHAT THEY DID.
Joe: SECOND DOWN AND TEN.
JACKSON IN TROUBLE AGAIN AND
ANOTHER SACK.
IT'S ANZALONE AND AL-QUADIN
MUHAMMAD WHO'S BEEN EVERYWHERE
TONIGHT AND THAT'S A SEVEN-SACK
NIGHT FOR THE LIONS.
ON LAMAR JACKSON.
KELVIN SHEPPARD BETTER GET A
GAME -- BETTER GET A GAME BALL
IN THIS ONE TONIGHT TOO.
Troy: YEAH, I MENTIONED IT.
I WAS AS ANXIOUS RAS ANYONE TO
SEE HOW THE LIONS WOULD DO WITH
NEW COORDINATORS AND JOHN
MORTON, KELVIN SHEPPARD.
Joe: BIG HIT BY BRANCH AND
NICE JOB BY HILL.
SURVIVES THAT HILL.
OUT OF BOUNDS HE GOES.
T ALL THE CREDIT.
YOU KNOW WE SHOW THE POINT OR
EXCUSE ME THE WIN TOTALS AND HOW
HES INCREASED THEM.
HELL HAVE A HARD TIME
INCREASING FROM LAST YEAR.
YEAH 15 AND TWO.
BUT YOU KNOW ITS HARD WHEN YOU
LOSE YOUR COORDINATORS.
ITS HARD WHEN YOU LOSE AS MANY
COACHES OFF THE STAFF AS HE DID
THIS PAST YEAR.
AND THEN YOURE REPLACING THEM
AND THEN STARTING OVER.
AND I MEAN, IT IS REALLY HARD ON
A LOT OF LEVELS FOOTBALL WISE,
BUT ALSO TO TO HIM PERSONALLY.
AND YET HE FILLED THOSE
VACANCIES AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS,
IT LOOKS LIKE HE DID A GREAT JOB
WITH IT.
NICE THROW AND CATCH.
BATEMAN MADE THE GRAB.
ITS A TOTAL OF EIGHT.
IF YOU WANT TO PUT A NUMBER TO
IT.
YEAH, THE TWO COORDINATORS AND
SIX ASSISTANT COACHES.
AND YET THEYVE FILLED IN.
THESE TEAMS KIND OF MIRROR EACH
OTHER.
THEYVE GOT GREAT COORDINATORS.
THEYVE GOT GMS THAT FIND TALENT
EVERYWHERE.
THEYVE GOT GOOD OWNERSHIP, GOT
A HEAD COACH THAT IS IN CONTROL,
IN CHARGE.
THEYVE GOT GREAT ROSTERS.
AND FOR DAN CAMPBELL TO FILL IN
WITH EIGHT NEW COACHES.
UNDER HIM FOR THE LIONS ITS
IMPRESSIVE.
JACKSON STEPS THROUGH.
CHASED DOWN FROM BEHIND AND NOW
OUT OF BOUNDS AS BRANCH GETS
THERE FOR DETROIT.
KNOW WHEN WE TALKED TO DAN
CAMPBELL ABOUT THE RESPECT THAT
HE HAS FOR THE BALTIMORE RAVENS.
AND HE SAID AS A FIRST TIME HEAD
COACH, YOU ASK YOURSELF WHAT YOU
WANT YOUR PROGRAM TO LOOK LIKE.
AND BALTIMORE IS THAT TEAM.
AND THEYVE BEEN DOING IT AT A
HIGH LEVEL FOR 30 YEARS.
AND DAN CAMPBELL SAID, YOU KNOW,
THATS WHAT I WANTED MY PROGRAM
TO LOOK LIKE, THE WAY IN WHICH
THEY COMPETE, THEIR PHYSICAL
STYLE, THEIR AGGRESSIVE AND
EVERYTHING IS KIND OF IN UNISON
THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION.
THE PEOPLE THEY BRING IN.
ERIC DECOSTA, OF COURSE, WHO
REPLACED OZZIE NEWSOME AS THE
GENERAL MANAGER.
AND THEYVE JUST THERES SO MUCH
CONTINUITY IN HOW THEY RUN THE
ORGANIZATION IN BALTIMORE AND IN
DETROIT HAS BEEN THE SAME WAY.
AND AND THE PROOF IS IN THE
RESULTS.
THERES OZZIE HALL OF FAMER TWO
TIMES OVER SECOND DOWN AND
SEVEN.
JACKSON BACKPEDALING.
ANDREWS WIDE OPEN ONE ON ONE.
AND HELL TAKE IT IN HIS SECOND
OF THE NIGHT WITH 29 SECONDS TO
GO.
THEYLL GO FOR TWO.
AND THEN.
WELL HAVE AN ONSIDE KICK.
SO NOTHING HAPPENS.
EASY IN THIS LEAGUE.
YESTERDAY WAS A CRAZY DAY AROUND
THE NFL.
THIS WOULD EASILY GO DOWN AS THE
CRAZIEST IF THE RAVENS WERE TO
GET UP OFF THE DECK.
14 POINTS DOWN WITH UNDER TWO
MINUTES TO GO.
YOU KNOW WE WEVE WEVE BEEN
AROUND THIS GAME A LITTLE TOO
LONG AS HAS JARED GOFF.
WHEN WE SHOWED HIM YOU SAW THE
LOOK ON HIS FACE AFTER THAT
TOUCHDOWN MONDAY.
RONNIE PITCH TWO POINT TRY WILL
BE THEIR FIRST OF THE YEAR.
HEY ITS HOT.
JACKSON FLIPS IT.
FLAG IS DOWN IN THE END ZONE.
ITS A HOLD AGAINST THE LIONS.
WEVE REFERENCED THE CRAZY DAY
THAT YESTERDAY WAS AROUND THE
NFL.
YESTERDAY.
HOLDING DEFENSE NUMBER 32.
INELIGIBLE RECEIVER DOWNFIELD
OFFENSE NUMBER 77.
PENALTIES.
OFFSET.
RETRY.
SO WELL RETRY THE TWO POINT
CONVERSION.
TWO POINT CONVERSION ON MIKE
CLAY.
THEY WERE NINE DEFENSIVE AND
SPECIAL TEAMS TOUCHDOWNS THIS
WEEK, MOST IN FIVE YEARS.
AND THE FIRST DAY IN NFL HISTORY
WITH MULTIPLE BLOCKED FIELD
GOALS RETURNED FOR TOUCHDOWNS IN
THE FOURTH QUARTER, BOTH WITH
UNDER TWO MINUTES TO PLAY.
YESTERDAY.
BACKPEDALING AND INCOMPLETE FOR
ZAY, FLOWERS.
ADD TO THAT WOULD BE IF THE
RAVENS COME UP WITH THE SECOND
SUCCESSFUL ONSIDE KICK OF THE
SEASON.
TEAMS ARE ONE FOR 11.
THE ONLY TEAM TO GET ONE WAS
CAROLINA IN WEEK TWO AT ARIZONA.
ONE OTHER LITTLE NOTE BEFORE WE
RUN OUT OF TIME AT THE END.
THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND TIME THE
RAVENS DEFENSE HAS ALLOWED FOUR
RUSHING TOUCHDOWNS AT HOME IN
THEIR 30 YEAR.
HISTORY SINCE 96.
THATS WHAT THE LIONS HAVE DONE
TONIGHT.
LUKE, THE ROOKIE WILL TRY AND
COME UP WITH A PERFECT KICK.
UP IT GOES.
LAPORTA HAS HAD A NICE NIGHT AND
THE LIONS WILL TAKE OVER WITH 27
SECONDS TO GO.
AND THATLL DO IT.
THATLL DO IT.
THIS IS AS YOU MENTIONED JOE.
THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOOD WIN
FOR WHOEVER WON IT.
BUT FOR DETROIT TO BE ABLE TO
WIN ON THE ROAD, YOU CAN SEE
WHAT IT MEANS TO DAN CAMPBELL.
AND THAT SIDELINES AND EVERYBODY
IN A LIONS UNIFORM.
BUT.
THIS IS A RAVENS TEAM THAT I
STILL THINK IS ONE OF THE BEST.
AND YOU KNOW YOU DIG YOURSELF A
LITTLE BIT OF A HOLE.
THE GOOD NEWS IS THERES STILL A
LOT OF FOOTBALL LEFT TO BE
PLAYED.
BUT THEYVE GOT A LOT TO CLEAN
UP.
THERE IS SOME BAD NEWS, THOUGH.
THEY DO HAVE THREE UPCOMING
OPPONENTS THE NEXT THREE WEEKS.
IT ALL PLAYED IN THE DIVISIONAL
ROUND OF THE PLAYOFFS, AND THEY
WILL HEAD INTO KANSAS CITY NEXT
WEEK WITH A RECORD OF ONE AND
TWO.
THAT GAME ON SUNDAY.
THIS IS AN EIGHT POINT WIN FOR
THE LIONS TO GET TO TWO AND ONE,
AND THIS WAS AN IMPRESSIVE NIGHT
ALL THE WAY AROUND FOR DETROIT.
38 CARRIES ON THE NIGHT FOR THE
LIONS 224 YARDS FOUR TOUCHDOWNS.
GOFF 20 OF 28 2021 TOUCHDOWN NO
PICKS.
AND HE MADE SOME BIG THROWS WHEN
THEY MATTERED MOST.
WELL, HE SURE DID.
AND WHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO ON
ON THIRD DOWN TONIGHT.
YOU KNOW, IT WAS IN A LOT OF
WAYS A DIFFERENCE.
BUT WHEN THEY NEEDED HIM TO MAKE
THE THROW AND DELIVER, HE HE DID
IT.
LETS SEND IT DOWN TO
